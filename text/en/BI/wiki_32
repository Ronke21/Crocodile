<text>Mercury poisoning is a type of metal poisoning due to exposure to mercury. Symptoms depend upon the type, dose, method, and duration of exposure. They may include muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness in the hands and feet, skin rashes, anxiety, memory problems, trouble speaking, trouble hearing, or trouble seeing. High-level exposure to methylmercury is known as Minamata disease. Methylmercury exposure in children may result in acrodynia (pink disease) in which the skin becomes pink and peels. Long-term complications may include kidney problems and decreased intelligence. The effects of long-term low-dose exposure to methylmercury are unclear.
Forms of mercury exposure include metal, vapor, salt, and organic compound. Most exposure is from eating fish, amalgam-based dental fillings, or exposure at a workplace. In fish, those higher up in the food chain generally have higher levels of mercury, a process known as biomagnification. Less commonly, poisoning may occur as a method of attempted suicide. Human activities that release mercury into the environment include the burning of coal and mining of gold. Tests of the blood, urine, and hair for mercury are available but do not relate well to the amount in the body.
Prevention includes eating a diet low in mercury, removing mercury from medical and other devices, proper disposal of mercury, and not mining further mercury. In those with acute poisoning from inorganic mercury salts, chelation with either dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) appears to improve outcomes if given within a few hours of exposure. Chelation for those with long-term exposure is of unclear benefit. In certain communities that survive on fishing, rates of mercury poisoning among children have been as high as 1.7 per 100.
==Signs and symptoms==
Common symptoms of mercury poisoning are peripheral neuropathy, presenting as paresthesia or itching, burning, pain, or even a sensation that resembles small insects crawling on or under the skin (formication); skin discoloration (pink cheeks, fingertips and toes); swelling; and desquamation (shedding or peeling of skin).

Mercury irreversibly inhibits selenium-dependent enzymes (see below) and may also inactivate &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl-methionine, which is necessary for catecholamine catabolism by catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyl transferase. Due to the body&#x27;s inability to degrade catecholamines (e.g. adrenaline), a person with mercury poisoning may experience profuse sweating, tachycardia (persistently faster-than-normal heart beat), increased salivation, and hypertension (high blood pressure).

Affected children may show red cheeks, nose and lips, loss of hair, teeth, and nails, transient rashes, hypotonia (muscle weakness), and increased sensitivity to light. Other symptoms may include kidney dysfunction (e.g. Fanconi syndrome) or neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional lability, memory impairment, or insomnia.

Thus, the clinical presentation may resemble pheochromocytoma or Kawasaki disease. Desquamation (skin peeling) can occur with severe mercury poisoning acquired by handling elemental mercury.

==Causes==

Historically, medicines could contain mercury and thus do more harm than good to patients. The popular Victorian medicine calomel contained mercury. In her 1859 autobiography, Scottish seamstress Elizabeth Storie describes her life as a disabled woman due to severe mercury poisoning when a doctor attempted to treat a mild childhood disease with prolonged administration of calomel. In 1862 a soldier in the American civil war, Carleton Burgan, suffered a similar disfigurement when he was treated with calomel for an infection.

Today, consumption of fish containing mercury is by far the most significant source of ingestion-related mercury exposure in humans, although plants and livestock also contain mercury due to bioconcentration of organic mercury from seawater, freshwater, marine and lacustrine sediments, soils, and atmosphere, and due to biomagnification by ingesting other mercury-containing organisms. Exposure to mercury can occur from breathing contaminated air, from eating foods that have acquired mercury residues during processing, from exposure to mercury vapor in mercury amalgam dental restorations, and from improper use or disposal of mercury and mercury-containing objects, for example, after spills of elemental mercury or improper disposal of fluorescent lamps.

All of these, except elemental liquid mercury, produce toxicity or death with less than a gram. Mercury&#x27;s zero oxidation state (Hg0) exists as vapor or as liquid metal, its mercurous state (Hg+) exists as inorganic salts, and its mercuric state (Hg2+) may form either inorganic salts or organomercury compounds.

Consumption of whale and dolphin meat, as is the practice in Japan, is a source of high levels of mercury poisoning. Tetsuya Endo, a professor at the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, has tested whale meat purchased in the whaling town of Taiji and found mercury levels more than 20 times the acceptable Japanese standard.

Human-generated sources, such as coal-burning power plants emit about half of atmospheric mercury, with natural sources such as volcanoes responsible for the remainder. A 2021 publication investigating the mercury distribution in European soils found that high mercury concentrations are found close to abandoned mines (such as Almadén (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain), Mt. Amiata (Italy), Idrija (Slovenia) and Rudnany (Slovakia)) and coal-fired power plants. An estimated two-thirds of human-generated mercury comes from stationary combustion, mostly of coal. Other important human-generated sources include gold production, nonferrous metal production, cement production, waste disposal, human crematoria, caustic soda production, pig iron and steel production, mercury production (mostly for batteries), and biomass burning.

Small independent gold-mining operation workers are at higher risk of mercury poisoning because of crude processing methods. Such is the danger for the galamsey in Ghana and similar workers known as &quot;orpailleurs&quot; in neighboring francophone countries. While no official government estimates of the labor force have been made, observers believe 20,000–50,000 work as galamseys in Ghana, a figure including many women, who work as porters. Similar problems have been reported amongst the gold miners of Indonesia.

Some mercury compounds, especially organomercury compounds, can also be readily absorbed through direct skin contact. Mercury and its compounds are commonly used in chemical laboratories, hospitals, dental clinics, and facilities involved in the production of items such as fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, and explosives.

Many traditional medicines, including ones used in Ayurvedic medicine, and in Traditional Chinese medicine, contain mercury and other heavy metals.

===Sources===
Organic compounds of mercury tend to be much more toxic than either the elemental form or the salts. These compounds have been implicated in causing brain and liver damage. The most dangerous mercury compound, dimethylmercury, is so toxic that even a few microliters spilled on the skin, or even on a latex glove, can cause death.

==== Methylmercury and related organomercury compounds====

Methylmercury is the major source of organic mercury for all individuals. Due to bioaccumulation, it works its way up through the food web and thus biomagnifies, resulting in high concentrations among populations of some species. Top predatory fish, such as tuna or swordfish, are usually of greater concern than smaller species. The US FDA and the EPA advise women of child-bearing age, nursing mothers, and young children to completely avoid swordfish, shark, king mackerel and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, and to limit consumption of albacore (&quot;white&quot;) tuna to no more than per week, and of all other fish and shellfish to no more than per week. A 2006 review of the risks and benefits of fish consumption found, for adults, the benefits of one to two servings of fish per week outweigh the risks, even (except for a few fish species) for women of childbearing age, and that avoidance of fish consumption could result in significant excess coronary heart disease deaths and suboptimal neural development in children.

Because the process of mercury-dependent sequestration of selenium is slow, the period between exposure to methylmercury and the appearance of symptoms in adult poisoning cases tends to be extended. The longest recorded latent period is five months after a single exposure, in the Dartmouth case (see History); other latent periods in the range of weeks to months have also been reported. When the first symptom appears, typically paresthesia (a tingling or numbness in the skin), it is followed rapidly by more severe effects, sometimes ending in coma and death. The toxic damage appears to be determined by the peak value of mercury, not the length of the exposure.

Methylmercury exposure during rodent gestation, a developmental period that approximately models human neural development during the first two trimesters of gestation, has long-lasting behavioral consequences that appear in adulthood and, in some cases, may not appear until aging. Prefrontal cortex or dopamine neurotransmission could be especially sensitive to even subtle gestational methylmercury exposure and suggests that public health assessments of methylmercury based on intellectual performance may underestimate the impact of methylmercury in public health.

Ethylmercury is a breakdown product of the antibacteriological agent ethylmercurithiosalicylate, which has been used as a topical antiseptic and a vaccine preservative (further discussed under Thiomersal below). Its characteristics have not been studied as extensively as those of methylmercury. It is cleared from the blood much more rapidly, with a half-life of seven to ten days, and it is metabolized much more quickly than methylmercury. It is presumed not to have methylmercury&#x27;s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier via a transporter, but instead relies on simple diffusion to enter the brain. Other exposure sources of organic mercury include phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate. These compounds were used in indoor latex paints for their antimildew properties, but were removed in 1990 because of cases of toxicity.

====Inorganic mercury compounds====
Mercury occurs as salts such as mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2), the latter also known as calomel. Because they are more soluble in water, mercuric salts are usually more acutely toxic than mercurous salts. Their higher solubility lets them be more readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Mercury salts affect primarily the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys, and can cause severe kidney damage; however, as they cannot cross the blood–brain barrier easily, these salts inflict little neurological damage without continuous or heavy exposure. Mercuric cyanide (Hg(CN)2) is a particularly toxic mercury compound that has been used in murders, as it contains not only mercury but also cyanide, leading to simultaneous cyanide poisoning. The drug n-acetyl penicillamine has been used to treat mercury poisoning with limited success.

====Elemental mercury====
Quicksilver (liquid metallic mercury) is poorly absorbed by ingestion and skin contact. Its vapor is the most hazardous form. Animal data indicate less than 0.01% of ingested mercury is absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal tract, though it may not be true for individuals with ileus. Cases of systemic toxicity from accidental swallowing are rare, and attempted suicide via intravenous injection does not appear to result in systemic toxicity, though it still causes damage by physically blocking blood vessels both at the site of injection and the lungs. Though not studied quantitatively, the physical properties of liquid elemental mercury limit its absorption through intact skin and in light of its very low absorption rate from the gastrointestinal tract, skin absorption would not be high. Some mercury vapor is absorbed dermally, but uptake by this route is only about 1% of that by inhalation.

In humans, approximately 80% of inhaled mercury vapor is absorbed via the respiratory tract, where it enters the circulatory system and is distributed throughout the body. Chronic exposure by inhalation, even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3, has been shown in case–control studies to cause effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers.

Acute inhalation of high concentrations causes a wide variety of cognitive, personality, sensory, and motor disturbances. The most prominent symptoms include tremors (initially affecting the hands and sometimes spreading to other parts of the body), emotional lability (characterized by irritability, excessive shyness, confidence loss, and nervousness), insomnia, memory loss, neuromuscular changes (weakness, muscle atrophy, muscle twitching), headaches, polyneuropathy (paresthesia, stocking-glove sensory loss, hyperactive tendon reflexes, slowed sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities), and performance deficits in tests of cognitive function.

==Mechanism==
The toxicity of mercury sources can be expected to depend on its nature, i.e., salts vs. organomercury compounds vs. elemental mercury.

The primary mechanism of mercury toxicity involves its irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes, such as thioredoxin reductase (IC50 = 9 nM). Although it has many functions, thioredoxin reductase restores vitamins C and E, as well as a number of other important antioxidant molecules, back into their reduced forms, enabling them to counteract oxidative damage. Since the rate of oxygen consumption is particularly high in brain tissues, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is accentuated in these vital cells, making them particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage and especially dependent upon the antioxidant protection provided by selenoenzymes. High mercury exposures deplete the amount of cellular selenium available for the biosynthesis of thioredoxin reductase and other selenoenzymes that prevent and reverse oxidative damage, which, if the depletion is severe and long lasting, results in brain cell dysfunctions that can ultimately cause death.

Mercury in its various forms is particularly harmful to fetuses as an environmental toxin in pregnancy, as well as to infants. Women who have been exposed to mercury in substantial excess of dietary selenium intakes during pregnancy are at risk of giving birth to children with serious birth defects, such as those seen in Minamata disease. Mercury exposures in excess of dietary selenium intakes in young children can have severe neurological consequences, preventing nerve sheaths from forming properly.

Exposure to methylmercury causes increased levels of antibodies sent to myelin basic protein (MBP), which is involved in the myelination of neurons, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is essential to many functions in the central nervous system (CNS). This causes an autoimmmune response against MBP and GFAP and results in the degradation of neural myelin and general decline in function of the CNS.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of elemental or inorganic mercury poisoning involves determining the history of exposure, physical findings, and an elevated body burden of mercury. Although whole-blood mercury concentrations are typically less than 6 μg/L, diets rich in fish can result in blood mercury concentrations higher than 200 μg/L; it is not that useful to measure these levels for suspected cases of elemental or inorganic poisoning because of mercury&#x27;s short half-life in the blood. If the exposure is chronic, urine levels can be obtained; 24-hour collections are more reliable than spot collections. It is difficult or impossible to interpret urine samples of people undergoing chelation therapy, as the therapy itself increases mercury levels in the samples.

Diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning differs in that whole-blood or hair analysis is more reliable than urinary mercury levels.

==Prevention==
Mercury poisoning can be prevented or minimized by eliminating or reducing exposure to mercury and mercury compounds. To that end, many governments and private groups have made efforts to heavily regulate the use of mercury, or to issue advisories about the use of mercury. Most countries have signed the Minamata Convention on Mercury.

The export from the European Union of mercury and some mercury compounds has been prohibited since 15 March 2011. The European Union has banned most uses of mercury. Mercury is allowed for fluorescent light bulbs because of pressure from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Hungary, which are connected to the main producers of fluorescent light bulbs: General Electric, Philips and Osram.


The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued recommendations in 2004 regarding exposure to mercury in fish and shellfish. The EPA also developed the &quot;Fish Kids&quot; awareness campaign for children and young adults on account of the greater impact of mercury exposure to that population.

===Cleaning spilled mercury===

Mercury thermometers and mercury light bulbs are not as common as they used to be, and the amount of mercury they contain is unlikely to be a health concern if handled carefully. However, broken items still require careful cleanup, as mercury can be hard to collect and it is easy to accidentally create a much larger exposure problem. If available, powdered sulfur may be applied to the spill, in order to create a solid compound that is more easily removed from surfaces than liquid mercury.

==Treatment==
Identifying and removing the source of the mercury is crucial. Decontamination requires removal of clothes, washing skin with soap and water, and flushing the eyes with saline solution as needed.

Before the advent of organic chelating agents, salts of iodide were given orally, such as heavily popularized by Louis Melsens and many nineteenth and early twentieth century doctors.

===Chelation therapy===
Chelation therapy for acute inorganic mercury poisoning, a formerly common method, was done with DMSA, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), -penicillamine (DPCN), or dimercaprol (BAL). Only DMSA is FDA-approved for use in children for treating mercury poisoning. However, several studies found no clear clinical benefit from DMSA treatment for poisoning due to mercury vapor. No chelator for methylmercury or ethylmercury is approved by the FDA; DMSA is the most frequently used for severe methylmercury poisoning, as it is given orally, has fewer side-effects, and has been found to be superior to BAL, DPCN, and DMPS. α-Lipoic acid (ALA) has been shown to be protective against acute mercury poisoning in several mammalian species when it is given soon after exposure; correct dosage is required, as inappropriate dosages increase toxicity. Although it has been hypothesized that frequent low dosages of ALA may have potential as a mercury chelator, studies in rats have been contradictory. Glutathione and &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine (NAC) are recommended by some physicians, but have been shown to increase mercury concentrations in the kidneys and the brain.

Chelation therapy can be hazardous if administered incorrectly. In August 2005, an incorrect form of EDTA (edetate disodium) used for chelation therapy resulted in hypocalcemia, causing cardiac arrest that killed a five-year-old autistic boy.

===Other===
Experimental animal and epidemiological study findings have confirmed the interaction between selenium and methylmercury. Instead of causing a decline in neurodevelopmental outcomes, epidemiological studies have found that improved nutrient (i.e., omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, iodine, vitamin D) intakes as a result of ocean fish consumption during pregnancy improves maternal and fetal outcomes. For example, increased ocean fish consumption during pregnancy was associated with 4-6 point increases in child IQs.

==Prognosis==
Some of the toxic effects of mercury are partially or wholly reversible provided specific therapy is able to restore selenium availability to normal before tissue damage from oxidation becomes too extensive. Autopsy findings point to a half-life of inorganic mercury in human brains of 27.4 years. Heavy or prolonged exposure can do irreversible damage, in particular in fetuses, infants, and young children. Young&#x27;s syndrome is believed to be a long-term consequence of early childhood mercury poisoning.

Mercuric chloride may cause cancer as it has caused increases in several types of tumors in rats and mice, while methyl mercury has caused kidney tumors in male rats. The EPA has classified mercuric chloride and methyl mercury as possible human carcinogens (ATSDR, EPA)

===Detection in biological fluids===
Mercury may be measured in blood or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized people or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal over dosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the metal. The concentrations in both fluids tend to reach high levels early after exposure to inorganic forms, while lower but very persistent levels are observed following exposure to elemental or organic mercury. Chelation therapy can cause a transient elevation of urine mercury levels.

==History==

* Neolithic artists using cinnabar show signs of mercury poisoning.
* Several Chinese emperors and other Chinese nobles are known or suspected to have died or been sickened by mercury poisoning after alchemists administered them &quot;elixirs&quot; to promote health, longevity, or immortality that contained either elemental mercury or (more commonly) cinnabar. Among the most prominent examples:
** The first emperor of unified China, Qin Shi Huang, it is reported, died in 210 BC of ingesting mercury pills that were intended to give him eternal life.
** Emperor Xuānzong of Tang, one of the emperors of the late Tang dynasty of China, was prescribed &quot;cinnabar that had been treated and subdued by fire&quot; to achieve immortality. Concerns that the prescription was having ill effects on the emperor&#x27;s health and sanity were waved off by the imperial alchemists, who cited medical texts listing a number of the emperor&#x27;s conditions (including itching, formication, swelling, and muscle weakness), today recognized as signs and symptoms of mercury poisoning, as evidence that the elixir was effectively treating the emperor&#x27;s latent ailments. Xuānzong became irritable and paranoid, and he seems to have ultimately died in 859 from the poisoning.
*In his Natural History, Pliny the Elder writes that &quot;it is a fact generally admitted that [cinnabar] is a poison&quot; and warns against using it in medicine, also noting that workers polishing it &quot;tie on their face loose masks of bladder-skin, to prevent their inhaling the dust in breathing&quot;, one of the earliest mentions of PPE.
*Carl Scheele, a significant 18th century Swedish pioneer of chemical research, died from mercury poisoning arising from his work, at the relatively early age of 43. 
* The phrase &quot;mad as a hatter&quot; is likely a reference to mercury poisoning among milliners (so-called &quot;mad hatter disease&quot;), as mercury-based compounds were once used in the manufacture of felt hats in the 18th and 19th century. (The Mad Hatter character of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was, it is presumed, inspired by an eccentric furniture dealer named Theophilus Carter. Carter was not a victim of mad hatter disease although Lewis Carroll would have been familiar with the phenomenon of dementia that occurred among hatters.)
* In 1810, two British ships, HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; and , salvaged a large load of elemental mercury from a wrecked Spanish vessel near Cadiz, Spain. The bladders containing the mercury soon ruptured. The element spread about the ships in liquid and vapor forms. The sailors presented with neurologic compromises: tremor, paralysis, and excessive salivation as well as tooth loss, skin problems, and pulmonary complaints. In 1823 William Burnett, M.D. published a report on the effects of mercurial vapor. &quot;Triumph&quot; surgeon, Henry Plowman, had concluded that the ailments had arisen from inhaling the mercurialized atmosphere. His treatment was to order the lower deck gun ports to be opened, when it was safe to do so; sleeping on the orlop was forbidden; and no men slept in the lower deck if they were at all symptomatic. Windsails were set to channel fresh air into the lower decks day and night.
* Historically, gold-mercury amalgam was widely used in gilding, applied to the object and then heated to vaporize the mercury and deposit the gold, leading to numerous casualties among the workers. It is estimated that during the construction of Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral alone, 60 men died from the gilding of the main dome.
* For years, including the early part of his presidency, Abraham Lincoln took a common medicine of his time called &quot;blue mass&quot;, which contained significant amounts of mercury.
* On September 5, 1920, silent movie actress Olive Thomas ingested mercury capsules dissolved in an alcoholic solution at the Hotel Ritz in Paris. There is still controversy over whether it was suicide, or whether she consumed the external preparation by mistake. Her husband, Jack Pickford (the brother of Mary Pickford), had syphilis, and the mercury was used as a treatment of the venereal disease at the time. She died a few days later at the American Hospital in Neuilly.
* An early scientific study of mercury poisoning was in 1923–1926 by the German inorganic chemist, Alfred Stock, who himself became poisoned, together with his colleagues, by breathing mercury vapor that was being released by his laboratory equipment—diffusion pumps, float valves, and manometers—all of which contained mercury, and also from mercury that had been accidentally spilt and remained in cracks in the linoleum floor covering. He published a number of papers on mercury poisoning, founded a committee in Berlin to study cases of possible mercury poisoning, and introduced the term &quot;micromercurialism&quot;.
* The term &quot;Hunter-Russell syndrome&quot; derives from a study of mercury poisoning among workers in a seed-packaging factory in Norwich, England in the late 1930s who breathed methylmercury that was being used as a seed disinfectant and pesticide.
* Outbreaks of methylmercury poisoning occurred in several places in Japan during the 1950s due to industrial discharges of mercury into rivers and coastal waters. The best-known instances were in Minamata and Niigata. In Minamata alone, more than 600 people died due to what became known as Minamata disease. More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease. In 22 documented cases, pregnant women who consumed contaminated fish showed mild or no symptoms but gave birth to infants with severe developmental disabilities.
* Mercury poisoning of generations of Grassy Narrows and Whitedog native people in Ontario, Canada who were exposed to high levels of mercury by consuming mercury-contaminated fish when Dryden Chemical Company discharged over of mercury directly into the Wabigoon–English River system and continued with mercury air pollution until 1975.
* Widespread mercury poisoning occurred in rural Iraq in 1971–1972, when grain treated with a methylmercury-based fungicide that was intended for planting only was used by the rural population to make bread, causing at least 6530 cases of mercury poisoning and at least 459 deaths (see Basra poison grain disaster).
* On August 14, 1996, Karen Wetterhahn, a chemistry professor working at Dartmouth College, spilled a small amount of dimethylmercury on her latex glove. She began experiencing the symptoms of mercury poisoning five months later and, despite aggressive chelation therapy, died a few months later from a mercury induced neurodegenerative disease
* In April 2000, Alan Chmurny attempted to kill a former employee, Marta Bradley, by pouring mercury into the ventilation system of her car.
*On March 19, 2008, Tony Winnett, 55, inhaled mercury vapors while trying to extract gold from computer parts (by using liquid mercury to separate gold from the rest of the alloy), and died ten days later. His Oklahoma residence became so contaminated that it had to be gutted.
* In December 2008, actor Jeremy Piven was diagnosed with mercury poisoning possibly resulting from eating sushi twice a day for twenty years or from taking herbal remedies.
* In India, a study by Centre for Science and Environment and Indian Institute of Toxicology Research has found that in the country&#x27;s energy capital Singrauli, mercury is slowly entering people&#x27;s homes, food, water and even blood.
* The Minamata Convention on Mercury in 2016 announced that the signing of the &quot;international treaty designed to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic releases and emission of mercury and mercury compounds&quot; on April 22, 2016—Earth Day. It was the sixtieth anniversary of the discovery of the disease.
* In August 2024, chess player Amina Abakarova allegedly attempted to poison her rival, Umayganat Osmanova, by coating chess pieces in mercury from a thermometer.

=== Infantile acrodynia ===

Infantile acrodynia (also known as &quot;calomel disease&quot;, &quot;erythredemic polyneuropathy&quot;, and &quot;pink disease&quot;) is a type of mercury poisoning in children characterized by pain and pink discoloration of the hands and feet. The word is derived from the Greek, where άκρο means &quot;end&quot; or &quot;extremity&quot;, and οδυνη means &quot;pain&quot;. Acrodynia resulted primarily from calomel in teething powders and decreased greatly after calomel was excluded from most teething powders in 1954.

Acrodynia is difficult to diagnose; &quot;it is most often postulated that the etiology of this syndrome is an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction to mercury because of the lack of correlation with mercury levels, many of the symptoms resemble recognized mercury poisoning.&quot;

===Medicine===
Mercury was once prescribed as a purgative. 
Many mercury-containing compounds were once used in medicines. These include calomel (mercurous chloride), and mercuric chloride.

====Thiomersal====
In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove the organomercury compound thiomersal (spelled &quot;thimerosal&quot; in the US) from vaccines as quickly as possible, and thiomersal has been phased out of US and European vaccines, except for some preparations of influenza vaccine. The CDC and the AAP followed the precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unwarranted, but their 1999 action sparked confusion and controversy that thiomersal was a cause of autism.

Since 2000, the thiomersal in child vaccines has been alleged to contribute to autism, and thousands of parents in the United States have pursued legal compensation from a federal fund. A 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee favored rejecting any causal relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and autism. Autism incidence rates increased steadily even after thiomersal was removed from childhood vaccines. Currently there is no accepted scientific evidence that exposure to thiomersal is a factor in causing autism.

====Dental amalgam toxicity====

Dental amalgam is a possible cause of low-level mercury poisoning due to its use in dental fillings. Discussion on the topic includes debates on whether amalgam should be used, with critics arguing that its toxic effects make it unsafe.

===Cosmetics===
Some skin whitening products contain the toxic mercury(II) chloride as the active ingredient. When applied, the chemical readily absorbs through the skin into the bloodstream. The use of mercury in cosmetics is illegal in the United States. However, cosmetics containing mercury are often illegally imported. Following a certified case of mercury poisoning resulting from the use of an imported skin whitening product, the United States Food and Drug Administration warned against the use of such products. Symptoms of mercury poisoning have resulted from the use of various mercury-containing cosmetic products. The use of skin whitening products is especially popular amongst Asian women. In Hong Kong in 2002, two products were discovered to contain between 9,000 and 60,000 times the recommended dose.

===Fluorescent lamps===
Fluorescent lamps contain mercury, which is released when bulbs break. Mercury in bulbs is typically present as either elemental mercury liquid, vapor, or both, since the liquid evaporates at ambient temperature. When broken indoors, bulbs may emit sufficient mercury vapor to present health concerns, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends evacuating and airing out a room for at least 15 minutes after breaking a fluorescent light bulb. Breakage of multiple bulbs presents a greater concern. A 1987 report described a 23-month-old toddler who had anorexia, weight loss, irritability, profuse sweating, and peeling and redness of fingers and toes. This case of acrodynia was traced to exposure of mercury from a carton of 8-foot fluorescent light bulbs that had broken in a potting shed adjacent to the main nursery. The glass was cleaned up and discarded, but the child often used the area to play in.

===Assassination attempts===
Mercury has, allegedly, been used at various times to assassinate people. In 2008, Russian lawyer Karinna Moskalenko claimed to have been poisoned by mercury left in her car, while in 2010 journalists Viktor Kalashnikov and Marina Kalashnikova accused Russia&#x27;s FSB of trying to poison them. 

In 2011, German Christoph Bulwin was poisoned with a mercury compound from a syringe attached to an umbrella.

<text>Canadian Baptists of Ontario and Quebec (CBOQ) is a Baptist Christian denomination in central Canada. The organization&#x27;s headquarters is based in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. CBOQ is a partner of Canadian Baptist Ministries.

==History==
In 1880, a Baptist Union of Canada was formed. Since the churches were located chiefly in the central provinces, the name was changed in 1888 to Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec (BCOQ). In 1927 the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy resulted in 77 churches being penalized by the Convention and asked to leave the Convention. Due to involuntary removal of the affiliation with the Convention, the 77 churches were forming the Union of Regular Baptist Churches – out of which the current Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada emerged in 1953. In 1944, the CBOQ joined with the United Baptist Convention of the Maritimes and the Baptist Union of Western Canada to form the Canadian Baptist Federation. It was renamed in 2008 to &quot;Canadian Baptists of Ontario and Quebec&quot; (CBOQ) to better align with other Baptist groups in Canada: i.e. Canadian Baptists of Western Canada.

CBOQ meets annually at Assembly, electing officers, addressing issues, and offering workshops. According to its mission statement, &quot;CBOQ exist to equip our churches and leaders to engage in their mission from God in their community.&quot; &quot;The Canadian Baptist&quot; is a monthly e-newsletter and annual magazine that is published by the CBOQ. CBOQ&#x27;s affiliated seminary is McMaster Divinity College, a part of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. 

CBOQ provides practical and spiritual support to its family of churches and leaders through resources, workshops, prayer and regular gatherings. Through a grant program, CBOQ also supports a variety of ministries geared toward helping the most marginalized in society.

==Statistics==
According to a census published by the association in 2024, it claimed 330 churches and 28,000 members. 

== Beliefs == 
The association has a Baptist confession of faith. CBOQ is a member of Canadian Baptist Ministries, Evangelical Fellowship of Canada and Canadian Council of Churches.

<doc id="344293" wikidata="Q344997" url="?curid=344293" title="Ted DiBiase">
<text>Theodore Marvin DiBiase Sr. (; born January 18, 1954) is an American retired professional wrestler, manager, and color commentator. He is signed to WWE as of 2024, where he works in their Legends program. DiBiase achieved championship success in a number of wrestling promotions, holding thirty titles during his professional wrestling career. He is best recalled by mainstream audiences for his time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he wrestled as &quot;the Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase. He has been named as one of the best technical wrestlers, and greatest villains in pro wrestling history.

Among other accolades in the WWF/E, DiBiase was the first WWF North American Heavyweight Champion, a three-time WWF Tag Team Champion (with Irwin R. Schyster), a one-time WWE 24/7 Champion, and winner of the 1988 King of the Ring tournament. DiBiase also awarded himself the Million Dollar Championship, which was held by various associated wrestlers including DiBiase&#x27;s onscreen proteges, Stone Cold Steve Austin and LA Knight. DiBiase headlined multiple WWF cards, including WrestleMania IV and the first-ever SummerSlam in 1988. DiBiase is a member of several professional wrestling halls of fame: he was inducted into the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame upon its inception in 1996, and headlined the 2010 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony.

== Early life ==
DiBiase was born Theodore Marvin Willis in Omaha, Nebraska. He is the biological son of Ted Wills, an entertainer and singer; and Helen Nevins, a wrestler. He is the adopted son of wrestler &quot;Iron&quot; Mike DiBiase, who married his mother when he was 4 years old.
His adoptive father Mike died of a heart attack in the ring when DiBiase was 15. Seven-time NWA World champion Harley Race rushed to the ring and performed CPR, but was unable to save Iron Mike&#x27;s life. In response, his mother suffered from depression and alcoholism, so DiBiase was moved to Willcox, Arizona, to live with his grandparents. He attended Creighton Preparatory high school in Omaha, Nebraska and attended West Texas State University on a football scholarship. While there he became a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. However, due to an injury in his senior year, he later dropped out of college to begin a career in professional wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Mid-South Wrestling (1974–1979) ===
Ted DiBiase was trained by Dory Funk Jr. and Terry Funk. He made his professional wrestling debut as a referee in June 1974 in the Amarillo territory owned by the Funks. He then went to the Mid-South territory of Bill Watts being promoted as the son of Iron Mike in 1975 where he wrestled for four years. His first match was a loss against Danny Hodge. By February 1978, DiBiase would unseat Dick Slater to become Missouri State champion only to lose to Dick Murdoch after a few weeks on television.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Federation (1979) ===
In the beginning of 1979, DiBiase came to Vince McMahon Sr.&#x27;s World Wide Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Federation. 
On February 13, 1979, the WWWF North American Heavyweight Championship was created, and Ted DiBiase would be awarded the WWWF North American Heavyweight Championship, becoming the first champion.

In March 1979, the WWWF was renamed as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). 
The newly established championship would be renamed the WWF North American Heavyweight Championship shortly after the company&#x27;s name change.
On June 19, 1979, DiBiase would go onto lose the North American Championship to Pat Patterson.

He was Hulk Hogan&#x27;s opponent in Hogan&#x27;s first Madison Square Garden match.

===National Wrestling Alliance and return to MSW / Universal Wrestling Federation (1980–1987)===
DiBiase also spent time in the Georgia area where he had an early face run. One legendary angle had DiBiase enduring four piledrivers (one on the concrete floor and three in the ring) administered in the WTBS studio arena by The Fabulous Freebirds before his tag team partner, Tommy &quot;Wildfire&quot; Rich, threw in the towel (the angle of DiBiase being badly injured was so real the TBS studio audience could be seen crying). Rich and DiBiase later feuded, leading to a loser leaves town match which DiBiase won, but instead of Rich leaving the area, he donned a mask calling himself &quot;Mister R.&quot; The feud culminated in a match between Mister R and DiBiase, Rich appeared from backstage and distracted DiBiase. Mister R then rolled up DiBiase to get the win and unmasked as Brad Armstrong. Both DiBiase and Rich left the territory shortly thereafter.

In the early to mid-1980s, DiBiase participated in angles in various territories feuding with the likes of Ric Flair best known from this point in his Mid South return with the likes of Bob Roop, Paul Orndorff, Dick Murdoch, The Fabulous Freebirds and One Man Gang. DiBiase turned heel against the Junkyard Dog and formed a group called The Rat Pack with Jim Duggan and Matt Borne, ran Mid-south for months. Aligning with Skandor Akbar, Dibiase caused a riff with the group, namely Duggan. The two would feud until DiBiase lost a loser leaves town match. He also held various championships and made frequent trips to All Japan Pro Wrestling until his eventual departure from Mid-South Wrestling (which by this point was now the UWF). Typically, his matches ended with the use of a &quot;loaded&quot; black glove, which he pulled from his tights to &quot;knock out&quot; his opponent when the referee was not looking.

While locked in talks with the National Wrestling Alliance in 1987 after the UWF was acquired by Jim Crockett, DiBiase received an offer from the WWF. DiBiase was eventually convinced by WWF to sign despite the fact that he would not be told his gimmick until after he agreed, under the promise that it was something that would receive a serious push. WWF official Pat Patterson informed DiBiase that if owner Vince McMahon were to go out to wrestle, it would be the gimmick that he would give himself.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1983–1987, 1993) ===
DiBiase entered All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in 1983. He won the NWA United National Championship on October 14, 1983, in a tournament defeating Jerry Lawler by forfeit. Three months later, on January 28, 1984, DiBiase lost the title to Michael Hayes. DiBiase&#x27;s mother Helen Hild died two months later on March 4, 1984.

In August 1985, DiBiase formed a tag team with fellow gaijin Stan Hansen, and the two became the PWF Tag Team Champions when Hansen chose DiBiase to replace Bruiser Brody, who left for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Later that year, DiBiase and Hansen entered the 1985 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League and would emerge victorious, finishing in first place with 7 points.

On July 3, 1987, DiBiase and Hansen would lose the PWF Tag Team Championship to Jumbo Tsuruta and Tiger Mask, ending their two-year reign as champions. Eight days later, on July 11, DiBiase and Hansen regained the title for a second time, but would be stripped of the title shortly after due to DiBiase leaving AJPW for the WWF.

In September 1993, DiBiase returned to AJPW and reformed his team with Hansen. The two immediately saw success as they defeated The Holy Demon Army on September 3, 1993 for the World Tag Team Championship. Two months later, on November 13, 1993, DiBiase and Hansen would be stripped of the title so it could be put on the line for the 1993 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League. DiBiase would enter the tournament, but would only wrestle one match, on November 14, where he and Hansen defeated Tracey Smothers and Richard Slinger before he suffered neck and back injuries which forced him out of the tournament (Giant Baba ended up replacing him).

=== Return to the WWF (1987–1993, 1994–1996) ===
==== WWF Championship pursuits (1987–1988) ====

DiBiase made his return to the WWF as a babyface on May 15, 1987, at a house show in Houston, Texas. He came out to the ring to announce to those in attendance that it was only fitting that he was now competing in the WWF. Moments later The One Man Gang and Slick came to the ring for Gang&#x27;s scheduled match. The referee had to force DiBiase to leave before there was a confrontation. At the next house show on June 7, DiBiase would have his first match and lose to The One Man Gang. He went on to lose two additional house show confrontations to The Gang. DiBiase would tag-team with Sam Houston on June 26 against The One Man Gang and Ron Bass (Houston had run in to assist DiBiase against The Gang at one of the earlier house show matches); towards the end of the match, DiBiase (kayfabe) turned on and attacked Houston after Houston missed a dropkick on Bass, leaving him to get double-teamed and pinned. His actions during the match served to effectively turn DiBiase heel, right before the onscreen debut of his new gimmick.

On a June 27 episode of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;, DiBiase had his first vignette. He would now be known as &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot;, a millionaire who wore a gold-studded, dollar-sign-covered suit and, in time, a custom-made, diamond-encrusted and self-awarded &quot;Million Dollar Championship&quot; belt. The Million Dollar Man character was based on the type of wrestler who Vince McMahon would want to be. He was billed as having a spring residence in Palm Beach, Florida, a summer residence in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, an autumn residence in Bel Air, California, and a winter residence in the Netherlands Antilles.

DiBiase had a bodyguard by the name of Virgil, who was by his side during his matches and vignettes. The idea for the name Virgil was based on then-NWA/WCW booker Dusty Rhodes, whose real name was Virgil Runnels, though booker and producer Bruce Prichard disputes this. The name of DiBiase&#x27;s finishing move, the Million Dollar Dream (a Cobra Clutch), was also supposedly meant to be a rib (inside joke) towards Dusty Rhodes, who was nicknamed &quot;The American Dream&quot;. Virgil was often seen performing humiliating tasks, such as rubbing DiBiase&#x27;s feet. DiBiase claimed &quot;Everybody has a price&quot; demonstrating his &quot;power&quot; through a series of vignettes in which he did things such as bribe the manager of a local swimming pool to close for the day so he could have the pool to himself, or when the honeymoon suite in a hotel was already booked, he bribed the desk clerk to have the couple already in there thrown out. Other skits featured DiBiase traveling in limousines, giving $100 tips to waiters, and using $100 bills in convenience stores for small purchases like chewing gum. In reality, DiBiase&#x27;s road travel was deliberately booked for first-class airplane flights and five-star hotel accommodations, and he was given a stipend of petty cash from the WWF Offices so that he could &quot;throw money around&quot; in public (i.e. pick up tabs and &quot;overtip&quot;, buy drinks for entire bars, actually pay for small items with a $100 bill, etc.) in order to make the character seem more real. Other times, DiBiase invited fans (including a young Rob Van Dam and a then-unknown Linda McMahon) to perform humiliating acts (such as kissing his feet) for money. During one skit, he invited a young boy onto a stage and told him if he bounced a ball 15 times in succession, DiBiase would pay him $500. After the 14th bounce, DiBiase kicked the ball away, sending the boy home without pay; however, according to his autobiography, everybody who wasn&#x27;t paid on-camera &quot;was&quot; paid off-camera. He frequently stuffed a $100 bill into the mouth of a wrestler on whom he had used the Million Dollar Dream move. Virgil, however, would more often than not surreptitiously retrieve the discarded bill from the wrestler&#x27;s mouth.

His first big in-ring angle came in late 1987 on an episode of &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, where he announced his plan to buy the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hulk Hogan, as Hogan refused and said that DiBiase would have to defeat him in the ring for the championship belt. Hogan got the upper hand in a series of matches, and a frustrated DiBiase approached André the Giant to win the title for him, which did happen on the February 5, 1988, edition of &quot;The Main Event I&quot; (which aired live on NBC), where André defeated Hogan under questionable circumstances for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. This was the match of the infamous &quot;who is the true Dave Hebner&quot; debacle. Whom the crowd and viewers at home thought was the &quot;real&quot; Dave Hebner (it was actually his real-life twin brother Earl, whom many now mistake as being the original Hebner) counted the match finishing pin for André despite the fact that Hogan&#x27;s shoulder was up at the count of one. Afterwards the real Dave Hebner came running into the ring to dispute the ruling his &quot;evil twin&quot; had made awarding the WWF world championship to Andre the Giant; André then announced he was surrendering the championship belt and handed it to DiBiase. In the following days, DiBiase was, in fact, billed as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion in three house shows, defending the title one time against Bam Bam Bigelow.

However, WWF President Jack Tunney declared DiBiase was not the champion, as he did not win the title by pin or submission, and said that because Andre had surrendered the title, it was therefore vacant. André&#x27;s world title win was still recognized, though it is still considered the shortest world title reign in WWF history. This angle was an amplification of an angle in the old Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), when Larry Zbyszko paid Killer Tim Brooks $25,000 for his NWA National Heavyweight Championship in 1983.

A tournament was announced to crown a new WWF World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania IV, where DiBiase defeated Hacksaw Jim Duggan in the first round and Don Muraco in the quarterfinal before receiving a bye in the semi-finals to advance to the finals of the tournament. The reason for the bye was a double-elimination of Hulk Hogan and André the Giant when they both were disqualified in their match, with DiBiase meant to face the winner. In a backstage interview afterwards, André revealed that DiBiase paid him to make sure Hogan didn&#x27;t advance in the tournament. DiBiase was defeated by &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage in the finals, helped by Hulk Hogan negating André&#x27;s repeated interference in the match. DiBiase continued to feud with Savage over the WWF World Heavyweight Championship throughout the summer of 1988, even headlining in a tag team match pitting DiBiase and André the Giant vs. Hogan and Savage at the inaugural SummerSlam (in a match billed as &quot;Where The Mega Powers Meet The Mega Bucks&quot;). Although pro-heel commentator Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura served as the guest referee, Hogan pinned DiBiase to win the match. DiBiase then defeated Brutus Beefcake, Ken Patera, Ron Bass, and Randy Savage to win the 1988 King of the Ring tournament, receiving his first WWF success.

Bobby Heenan sold Hercules&#x27; contract to Ted DiBiase for his services as his personal slave. DiBiase claimed that Hercules was his slave, but started feuding with him after Hercules turned face. He eliminated Hercules from the main event at Survivor Series.

==== Million Dollar Champion (1989–1991) ====
At the Royal Rumble in 1989, DiBiase purchased the #30 entrance spot from Akeem to become the final entrant in the match. Big John Studd and DiBiase were the final two participants in the match. DiBiase offered Studd a bribe to eliminate himself, but Studd eliminated him to win the match. DiBiase continued to feud with Hercules; the two had a series of matches including a match that DiBiase won on the February 3 &quot;The Main Event II&quot;. He defeated The Blue Blazer on the March 11 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XX&quot;. After that match, he introduced the Million Dollar Championship, his own championship belt which was not recognized by the WWF. He created this belt because he was unable to buy or win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage.

DiBiase fought Brutus Beefcake to a double-count-out at WrestleMania V. DiBiase&#x27;s next big feud was with Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts. A few weeks after WrestleMania, DiBiase attacked Roberts on &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; after Roberts defeated Virgil in a match. DiBiase put Roberts out of action for several months with a neck injury. (The storyline was created so Roberts could get surgery on his back from the guitar attack from The Honky Tonk Man a year earlier.) While Roberts recuperated, DiBiase defeated Jimmy &quot;The Superfly&quot; Snuka at SummerSlam by count-out. On the October 14 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXIII&quot;, DiBiase faced Hulk Hogan in a match for the WWF Championship where DiBiase had the monster Zeus by his side. DiBiase lost the match when he accidentally hit Zeus and was pinned by Hogan with a small package. At Survivor Series, DiBiase captained a team dubbed the &quot;Million Dollar Team&quot; consisting of himself, The Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian), and Zeus against Hogan&#x27;s &quot;Hulkamaniacs&quot; consisting of Hogan, Jake Roberts, and Demolition (Ax and Smash). DiBiase eliminated Roberts after pinning him with help from Virgil before being pinned himself by Hogan.

In 1990, he was punished for buying #30 in the previous year&#x27;s Royal Rumble. For his punishment, he was forced to enter as entrant #1. He broke the record at the time by lasting 45 minutes in the Royal Rumble match after entering as the #1 entrant. He eliminated two opponents before he was eliminated by The Ultimate Warrior. This may have foreshadowed Dibiase seeking revenge on Warrior after Warrior became WWF Champion, by facing him several months later at a co-promotional All Japan and New Japan event in the Tokyo Dome. He then continued his feud with Jake Roberts, who stole the Million Dollar Belt, leading to a match at WrestleMania VI where Roberts was counted out. Shortly after WrestleMania, he had a brief feud with Big Bossman which dated back to when DiBiase tried to bribe Bossman into retrieving the Million Dollar Belt. Bossman refused DiBiase&#x27;s bribe and returned the Million Dollar Belt to Roberts. At SummerSlam, DiBiase bought the services of Sapphire, who was the manager of Dusty Rhodes at the time. This led to Rhodes and DiBiase feuding throughout the end of 1990 into the beginning of 1991. On the October 13 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXVIII&quot;, he attacked Dusty&#x27;s son Dustin Rhodes during Dusty&#x27;s match with Randy Savage. DiBiase and Dusty captained rival teams at Survivor Series, with DiBiase&#x27;s mystery partner turning out to be the debuting Undertaker. DiBiase wound up eliminating both members of The Hart Foundation and was the sole survivor of the match. He, however, was eliminated in the main event by Hogan. DiBiase said about Undertaker&#x27;s debut &quot;nobody knew him, at the time if you know how this works they were using my celebrity and me introducing The Undertaker was helping him get over. He wasn&#x27;t &#x27;The Phenom&#x27; then he was just a new kid on the card, this new character The Undertaker and of course he grew in to be one of the greatest attractions the WWE has ever had. At the time it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me, I was just doing my job.&quot; DiBiase then received a shot at the WWF champion: The Ultimate Warrior on a special Thanksgiving episode of Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event, which ended when DiBiase was disqualified after Virgil attacked Warrior, which was seemingly an interlude to Randy Savage further assaulting Warrior. During this time DiBiase started to develop a real-life disdain for the Warrior and would later become very vocal about it both in behind the scenes interviews and in his autobiography.

At the Royal Rumble, Ted DiBiase and Virgil defeated Dusty and Dustin Rhodes in a tag team match. After the match, DiBiase ordered Virgil to put the Million Dollar Championship belt around his waist. Virgil instead hit DiBiase with the belt, turning face. At WrestleMania VII, DiBiase lost by count-out to Virgil, who had help from &#x27;Rowdy&#x27; Roddy Piper. Sensational Sherri, who earlier in the night had turned on a losing Randy Savage, came down midway through the match to help DiBiase and became his full-time valet. On the April 27 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXIX&quot;, DiBiase fought Bret Hart to a double count-out.

DiBiase lost the Million Dollar Championship to Virgil at SummerSlam when Virgil smashed his head into an exposed turnbuckle and pinned him to get the victory. DiBiase participated in the 1991 King of the Ring tournament drawing with Ricky Steamboat in the first round. DiBiase and Steamboat would battle to a time-limit draw with neither man advancing in the tournament. DiBiase regained the Million Dollar Championship from Virgil with help from Repo Man on the November 11 edition of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot; which was dubbed &quot;Survivor Series Showdown&quot;. At Survivor Series, he was one of the contestants eliminated from his match. At This Tuesday in Texas, DiBiase and Repo Man defeated Virgil and Tito Santana.

==== Money Inc. and retirement (1992–1993) ====
Shortly after Royal Rumble 1992, DiBiase quietly dropped Sherri as his valet (so she could manage Shawn Michaels) and officially formed the tag team Money Incorporated with Irwin R. Schyster (IRS). The duo, mostly managed by Jimmy Hart, won the WWF Tag Team Championship three times between February 1992 and June 1993. Their first reign came on February 7, 1992, when they defeated The Legion of Doom for the titles. Money Incorporated then feuded with The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon). They defended the title against the Natural Disasters at WrestleMania VIII and lost the match by count-out, thus retaining the title. On July 20, they lost the title to the Natural Disasters.

After losing a match to the Legion of Doom at SummerSlam, DiBiase and IRS regained the belts on the October 13 edition of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; from the Natural Disasters. This title change led to a feud with The Nasty Boys, who were originally scheduled for the title shot. On the November 14 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXI&quot;, they defended their titles against the Ultimate Maniacs (Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage). DiBiase and IRS lost the match by count-out and thus retained the titles once more.

DiBiase participated in the Royal Rumble match, entering at #4 before eventually being eliminated by The Undertaker. Shortly after, DiBiase and IRS became involved in a major angle with the returning Brutus Beefcake. DiBiase faced Beefcake on one of the first episodes of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. DiBiase and IRS attacked Beefcake after the match and slammed his face (which had been surgically repaired following a wind sailing accident) with a briefcase. Money Inc. also attacked their manager Jimmy Hart, who was disgusted by their actions. Beefcake&#x27;s best friend Hulk Hogan came to Beefcake&#x27;s defense and challenged Money Inc. to a tag team title match at WrestleMania IX. DiBiase and IRS retained their titles by disqualification after Hogan used Beefcake&#x27;s protective face mask as a weapon.

Money Inc. dominated the tag team division of the WWF. They feuded with the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) and had a series of title exchanges. DiBiase and IRS were defeated by the Steiners for the WWF Tag Team Championship on June 14 in a non-televised match at a Wrestling Challenge taping. They would regain the titles on June 16 at a live event but lost them back to the Steiners three days later on June 19 at another live event, their feud culminated in a tag team steel cage match for the WWF Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam Spectacular. DiBiase last wrestled for the WWF in August, bowing out following an angle which saw Razor Ramon turn face and 1-2-3 Kid debut. The Kid had scored an upset pinfall against a cocky Ramon, causing DiBiase to mock Ramon and tell him he would show him how it was done. He then went on to also lose to the Kid, giving Razor a newfound respect for the Kid thus turning Razor face. This included a match at SummerSlam between DiBiase and Ramon which DiBiase lost. This was DiBiase&#x27;s last TV appearance in the WWF during this run. He revealed in a shoot interview that his decision to leave the WWF at this point was motivated by a desire to resolve his marital problems.

After a few months back in AJPW, where he won the World Tag Team Championship with Hansen, he quietly announced his retirement due to sustaining an injury to two cervical discs in his neck and returned to the USA.

==== Million Dollar Corporation (1994–1996) ====
DiBiase returned to the WWF at the Royal Rumble as a guest commentator. DiBiase then began working as a commentator and manager for the WWF. Later in 1994, DiBiase purchased the contracts of many wrestlers for his Million Dollar Corporation stable in the WWF, which over time included I.R.S., Bam Bam Bigelow, Nikolai Volkoff, Kama, King Kong Bundy, Sycho Sid, 1-2-3 Kid, and in a swerve, Tatanka. DiBiase also renewed his connection with the Undertaker after the latter&#x27;s six-month hiatus after the January Royal Rumble. Saying that he had originally brought the Undertaker to the WWF, and he was going to bring him back, DiBiase debuted a new Undertaker under his control. This Undertaker, however, proved to be an impostor played by Brian Lee, and was subsequently defeated by the real Undertaker at SummerSlam.

DiBiase also had a place in the main event of WrestleMania XI as the manager of Bam Bam Bigelow in his match versus Lawrence Taylor. Surrounding the ring were members of DiBiase&#x27;s corporation to offset Taylor&#x27;s entourage of NFL All-Pros on the opposite side. After Taylor defeated Bigelow, DiBiase publicly referred to Bigelow as an embarrassment. This culminated in Bigelow quitting The corporation after DiBiase fired him following a loss to Diesel in a WWF Championship match. Bigelow aligned himself with Diesel in a feud versus members of DiBiase&#x27;s corporation.

As a manager, DiBiase also later introduced &quot;The Ringmaster&quot;, who eventually became Stone Cold Steve Austin, to the WWF in January 1996. Austin became the Million Dollar Champion and began wearing DiBiase&#x27;s gold belt that was introduced in 1989. DiBiase&#x27;s last appearance with the company was at In Your House: Beware of Dog 2 in 1996, where he was kayfabe forced to leave the WWF after Steve Austin lost to Savio Vega. In reality, he left for rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

=== World Championship Wrestling (1996–1999) ===
DiBiase debuted in WCW on August 26, 1996, revealing himself as the fourth member of the New World Order, joining Scott Hall, Kevin Nash and Hollywood Hogan. DiBiase claimed to be financing the group (seemingly playing on his &quot;Million Dollar Man&quot; WWF persona). He was jokingly referred to by the members of the group as &quot;Trillionaire Ted&quot;, satirizing &quot;Billionaire Ted&quot;, which was itself a disparaging nickname WWF had given to WCW owner Ted Turner. DiBiase was the spokesperson for the nWo for 3 months until Eric Bischoff joined the nWo and replaced him in that role.

DiBiase quit the nWo shortly after Spring Stampede. A few months later, on the August 4, 1997, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, he made a face turn and began managing The Steiner Brothers, leading them to two World Tag Team Championships. DiBiase managed The Steiners until Scott Steiner turned heel via betraying Rick Steiner at SuperBrawl VIII on February 22 and joined the nWo (DiBiase still remained in Rick&#x27;s corner thru April 1998). DiBiase also managed one-time WWF rival Ray Traylor for a while until he stopped managing altogether.

In 2013, DiBiase said about his time in WCW: &quot;Eric Bischoff doesn&#x27;t know that much about wrestling&quot;, &quot;Eric took credit for the nWo but that wasn&#x27;t his idea, the nWo had already been done in Japan, so they had copied something that had already been done. It was a good idea, but originally I was supposed to be the mouthpiece of the nWo and reality is I think Eric saw how it was getting over and he saw how he could put himself in the role that he had hired me for. As each week went by pretty soon Eric isn&#x27;t the announcer anymore, he becomes part of the nWo and I just went to him one day and told him I&#x27;m not just going to walk out there and be Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Virgil, you hired me to be the spokesperson for this, so if that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m going to do you can send me home. The reason I said that was because they had to pay me one way or the other because I had a contract where they had to pay me for three years&quot;.

=== Second return to WWE (2004–2008, 2009–present) ===

==== Backstage roles (2004–2008) ====

In late 2004, WWE offered DiBiase a job as creative. He accepted the job and worked as part of the creative team a year and a half. In April 2005, DiBiase was hired as a creative consultant and road agent for the SmackDown! brand of World Wrestling Entertainment. On October 3, 2005, at &quot;WWE Homecoming&quot;, DiBiase appeared with other WWE legends in a ceremony. He eventually led the attack on Rob Conway, who had come down to the ring to insult the legends.
DiBiase inducted his former manager Sensational Sherri into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006 and made an appearance at WrestleMania 22, offering Eugene $1,000 to dribble a basketball 100 times backstage and kicked the ball away at the last second. DiBiase also appeared on the April 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; behind a newspaper doing his famous evil laugh as the camera went off air. DiBiase made an appearance at an IPW show in Newton, Iowa, on July 14, 2006, where he watched his sons&#x27; tag team match. The following day, he accepted the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame induction for his father, Mike, at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum. He also appeared at the &quot;Raw Family Reunion&quot; on October 9, 2006, aiding Ric Flair in his match with the Spirit Squad. On October 26, 2006, Ted DiBiase was released from his WWE contract.

DiBiase made his first in ring appearance in over five years at the &quot;Raw 15th Anniversary Special&quot; on December 10, 2007, by winning a 15-man battle royal, in which he was not even an active participant. Irwin R. Schyster, DiBiase&#x27;s former tag team partner of Money Incorporated, had won the battle royal. DiBiase came down to ringside and offered Schyster a bribe to eliminate himself. Schyster accepted and hopped over the top rope, making DiBiase the victor. DiBiase then declared that even after fifteen years, everyone still had a price for the &quot;Million Dollar Man.&quot;

On the May 19, 2008, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, he was seen alongside Mr. McMahon about to &quot;discuss business&quot;, in William Regal&#x27;s office. On the following &quot;Raw&quot;, DiBiase introduced his son Ted DiBiase Jr. to WWE as its newest member.

==== WWE Hall of Fame and sporadic appearances (2009–present) ====

On the June 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Ted DiBiase Jr. announced in a segment with Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton that DiBiase would appear on &quot;Raw&quot; the following week as the special guest host, and DiBiase appeared as scheduled on July 6. On the show, DiBiase booked his son to face Randy Orton. After DiBiase Jr. lost the match, he accused his father of setting him up and trying to steal his time, even slapping his father across the face. DiBiase would later come out at the end of the show and sanctioned a triple threat match for Randy Orton&#x27;s WWE Championship at Night of Champions including John Cena and Triple H in his final act as the guest host. He is also a playable character in &quot;WWE Legends of WrestleMania&quot; and an unlockable superstar in &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;. DiBiase was announced as the first inductee of the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2010 on the February 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. DiBiase appeared again on the November 2 edition of &quot;NXT&quot;, where he was the minister for Aksana and Goldust&#x27;s wedding. Later in November 2010, DiBiase made an appearance on Raw, accompanied by Irwin R. Schyster, wherein Goldust returned the stolen Million Dollar Championship to him. DiBiase immediately offered to give the newly returned title to his son Ted DiBiase Jr., but was refused. On February 21, 2011, it was announced DiBiase would induct Jim Duggan into the Hall of Fame. He appeared on the Slammy Awards episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on December 12 alongside fellow legend Mick Foley, and presented the &quot;Holy %&amp;@*# Move of the Year&quot; award, which was won by Mark Henry and Big Show. On April 10, 2012, DiBiase made an appearance on &quot;Smackdown: Blast from the Past&quot;. He returned on the March 4, 2013 &quot;Old School Raw&quot; at ringside with The Prime Time Players and agreed to be their manager if they won the match against Team Hell No. DiBiase, again accompanied by IRS, appeared at the 2014 &quot;Old School Raw&quot; special, encountering Big E Langston on his way to a match and told him everybody&#x27;s got a price, to which Langston smiled.

On January 22, 2018, DiBiase made an appearance during the 25th Anniversary episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in which he played Poker with The Acolytes Protection Agency.

On July 22, 2019, DiBiase &quot;bought&quot; the WWE 24/7 Championship from Alundra Blayze. The 26-year space between his last title victory in 1993 is reportedly the longest in WWE history. He later lost the title to Drake Maverick in a limousine on the same night.
On the April 27, 2021, episode of NXT, DiBiase &quot;was inside the jewelry store showing his Silver and Gold diamond watch in front of Cameron Grimes and his gold watch and made Grimes jealous. Throughout May 2021, DiBiase would continue to cost Grimes matches and outdo him during skits such as outbidding him during a house auction on May 11, and costing him a victory on May 18th, following this incident it was announced the pair would have a &#x27;Million Dollar Faceoff&#x27; on the May 25 episode of NXT. During the showdown, Grimes was attacked by L. A. Knight, with DiBiase yelling him he&#x27;s &quot;never gonna get it&quot; before laughing and leaving with Knight. DiBiase put the Million Dollar Championship on the line in a ladder match between Knight and Grimes at NXT TakeOver: In Your House, in which Knight was victorious. On June 15, 2021, episode of NXT, Knight turned on DiBiase and attacked him. Grimes saved DiBiase from Knight. At NXT Takeover 36 Knight would face Grimes again, If Grimes lost, DiBiase would have had to become Knight&#x27;s butler. At the event, Grimes defeated Knight to become the Million Dollar Champion with the help of DiBiase. On August 24, the storyline came to a conclusion on NXT, as they talked about Grimes&#x27; journey to the title and how he was now headed &quot;Straight to the moon!&quot;. The celebration ended with fake $100 bills with Grimes&#x27; face raining down over the Capitol Wrestling Center.

Grimes later escorted DiBiase to his limousine and handed him the Million Dollar Championship. DiBiase handed the belt back, however upon checking it, Grimes realizes he has been handed a cheap replica. DiBiase leaves after giving his signature laugh.

On January 23, 2023, Dibiase made a backstage appearance at Raw is XXX alongside Irwin R. Schyster.

== Christian ministry ==
DiBiase is now a Christian minister. In 1999, he founded &quot;Heart of David Ministry&quot; and travels the world ministering to churches, camps and conferences including Promise Keepers and Youth of the Nation. Ted is also the author of &quot;Every Man Has His Price&quot;, a part-autobiography and part-Christian testimony.

==Welfare fraud accusations==
In February 2020, it was reported that DiBiase&#x27;s ministry received more than $2.1 million in welfare funds from the state of Mississippi after his son, Brett, was hired as deputy administrator of the state&#x27;s Department of Human Services. His son, Brett, pleaded guilty to creating fraudulent statements in what has been labeled as Mississippi&#x27;s largest public embezzlement case in state history. In October 2021, a court ordered Ted DiBiase Sr. to pay $722,299 of the misappropriated funds given to his Heart of David Ministries. In May 2022, the Mississippi Department of Human Services sued DiBiase, his sons, and retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre, and several others to recover more than $20 million in money &quot;squandered&quot; from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families anti-poverty program.

In April 2022, the Mississippi Office of State Auditor reported that DiBiase personally received a $250,000 check from the Family Resource Center, a Mississippi welfare grantee, to &quot;provide services as a Motivational Speaker.&quot; DiBiase forwarded an email from the welfare grantee to his sons, Ted DiBiase Jr. and Brett DiBiase, stating: &quot;Look what I got today!&quot;. DiBiase says his famous name made his family a target for federal investigators. “We’re caught in the middle of it. If I didn’t have a celebrity name they wouldn’t even be looking at me.”

On February 22, 2024, Ted&#x27;s ex-agent opened up in an exclusive interview to discuss his thoughts on Ted&#x27;s involvement where eWrestlingNews quoted him as saying, &quot;it just doesn’t match the man that I’ve known. Ted, is careful in the sense that he wouldn’t do that, he has a real love for God and his wife. He just wouldn’t do that in my honest opinion.&quot;

Born in Leicester, Heskey started his career with Leicester City after progressing through their youth system, making his first-team debut in 1995. After winning the League Cup in 1997 and 2000 he made an £11 million move to Liverpool in 2000, which, at the time, was the record transfer fee paid by the club. At Liverpool, he won multiple honours, including the FA Cup in 2001. He moved to Birmingham City in 2004 and after their relegation from the Premier League signed for Wigan Athletic for a club record £5.5 million fee in 2006. He signed for Aston Villa in 2009 and was released in 2012 before signing for the Australian A-League club Newcastle Jets. After two years, he returned to England, finishing his career with Championship club Bolton Wanderers.

Heskey was an England international at under-16, under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut against Hungary in a 1–1 draw in 1999. He lost his place in the squad after UEFA Euro 2004, during which he failed to shine and was the subject of much criticism. After a long lay-off from international duty, Heskey was recalled to the England squad for UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers in September 2007. In England and Liverpool, Heskey formed a successful strike partnership with Michael Owen. He retired from international football following the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having attained 62 caps and scored 7 goals for his country.

In 2021, Heskey was announced as the head of women&#x27;s football development at Leicester City Women.

==Early life==
Heskey was born in Leicester, Leicestershire, to a family of Antiguan descent, and his father, Tyrone Heskey, ran the security of nightclubs in Leicester. He attended City of Leicester School, Evington.

==Club career==
===Leicester City===
Heskey was a keen footballer in his childhood and played for Ratby Groby Juniors, a local youth team in Leicester. He stood out amongst his peers and at the age of nine accepted a place at Leicester City&#x27;s football academy. Progressing through their youth system, he made his first-team debut at the age of 17 while still a first-year trainee in a Premier League match against Queens Park Rangers on 8 March 1995. Leicester were relegated to the First Division following the end of the 1994–95 season and he signed his first professional contract with the club on 3 October 1995. He became a first-team regular in the 1995–96 season, making 30 league appearances. During this season, Heskey scored his first goal, which came in a 1–0 victory over Norwich City, in a season he managed to score seven goals. He helped Leicester earn promotion back to the Premier League, starting in the 1996 First Division play-off final on 27 May as they beat Crystal Palace 2–1.

During the 1996–97 season, his first in the Premier League, Heskey scored 10 goals in 35 appearances, and scored the equaliser in the 1997 League Cup Final against Middlesbrough, which Leicester won in a replay. Heskey was runner-up to David Beckham for the PFA Young Player of the Year award. The following season saw interest from Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur for Heskey, as he again scored 10 Premier League goals, making him Leicester&#x27;s top scorer that season. However, the 1998–99 season saw Heskey score only six top-flight goals, and he was criticised for not scoring enough goals and going to ground too easily. During this season however, he forged an effective strike partnership with Tony Cottee, who benefited from Heskey&#x27;s unselfish style of play, which manager Martin O&#x27;Neill claimed kept the club in the Premier League. Heskey started for Leicester in the 1999 League Cup Final on 21 March, in which they were beaten 1–0 by Tottenham Hotspur. He went on to win the League Cup again with a 2–1 win against Tranmere Rovers in the 2000 final on 27 February.

===Liverpool===
Heskey signed for Liverpool on 10 March 2000 in a long-anticipated £11 million move, which, at the time, set the record transfer fee paid by the Merseyside club. Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier looked forward to working with him, but stated that &quot;at his age he is not the finished product&quot;. The press saw the move as expensive and risky as Heskey was relatively inexperienced and was not a prolific goalscorer. However, he was held in high regard by both the England under-21 manager, Peter Taylor, and England and Liverpool teammate Michael Owen. Veteran Liverpool striker Ian Rush approved of the signing, noting that Heskey would &quot;give Liverpool a different dimension&quot;, bringing strength to the Liverpool strikeforce and complementing Owen and Robbie Fowler&#x27;s pacey play. Heskey made his debut in an Premier League clash with Sunderland on 11 March 2000 and scored his first goal in a 3–0 victory over Coventry City on 1 April. He finished the 1999–2000 season with 12 appearances and 3 goals for Liverpool.

He started in the 2001 League Cup Final on 25 February, in which Liverpool beat Birmingham City 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 extra-time draw. He played in the 2001 FA Cup Final on 12 May 2001, starting ahead of Fowler, which Liverpool won 2–1 against Arsenal. Four days later, Heskey started in the 2001 UEFA Cup Final, in which Liverpool beat Deportivo Alavés 5–4 after extra time. In the 2000–01 season, Heskey scored 22 goals for Liverpool as the club won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup treble. He started for Liverpool in the 2001 FA Charity Shield on 12 August, in which they beat Manchester United 2–1. He scored Liverpool&#x27;s second goal when they beat Bayern Munich 3–2 in the 2001 UEFA Super Cup on 24 August.

Heskey started for Liverpool in their 2–1 defeat to Arsenal in the 2002 FA Community Shield on 11 August 2002. He was linked with a £12 million move to Tottenham Hotspur in December 2002, but Houllier insisted he was a part of his long-term plans and he remained at Liverpool. The same year, Heskey made a six-figure donation to aid a consortium led by Gary Lineker in their bid to buy-out his former club, Leicester City, who were experiencing financial difficulties. He started in Liverpool&#x27;s 2–0 win over Manchester United in the 2003 League Cup Final on 2 March. The 2002–03 season saw him score 9 goals in 51 appearances for Liverpool and received criticism for his low goal to game ratio, with Houllier claiming that his future at the club was safe.

He picked up a hamstring injury during a match against Newcastle United in January 2004, which ruled him out of action for three weeks. In the 2003–04 season, Heskey faced increasing competition from Milan Baroš for a place in the Liverpool starting line-up. He regained his place in the team after an injury ruled Baroš out for months and finished the season with 12 goals.

===Birmingham City===
At the end of the 2003–04 season, Heskey signed for Birmingham City on 18 May 2004 on a five-year contract for an initial £3.5 million fee, which could have risen to £6.25 million, and would thus have become Birmingham&#x27;s most expensive player. He suffered an ankle injury during a pre-season friendly against CA Osasuna, which put his Premier League debut against Portsmouth in doubt. He was eventually able to play against Portsmouth on 14 August, and the match ended as a 1–1 draw. His first goal came with a header in the eighth minute against Manchester City, which was enough to earn a 1–0 victory on 24 August. At the end of that season Birmingham finished 12th in mid-table. Heskey was named as the club&#x27;s Player of the Season, Player&#x27;s Player of the Season, finished as top goalscorer with 11 goals and won most man of the match awards.

He suffered from an ankle injury against Blackburn Rovers on 19 April 2006, and after passing a late fitness test, played in a 0–0 draw against Everton on 22 April. Birmingham&#x27;s 2005–06 season, during which Heskey scored only four goals in 34 league appearances, culminated in relegation to the Championship. During this season, Heskey gave inconsistent performances and received abuse from Birmingham fans. Birmingham managing director Karren Brady stated that Birmingham&#x27;s relegation meant that the last £1.5 million of the maximum £6.25 million fee for signing Heskey from Liverpool would not be payable.

===Wigan Athletic===
Heskey was signed by Premier League club Wigan Athletic on 7 July 2006 for a £5.5 million fee. He made his debut against Newcastle United on 19 August 2006, which his new team lost 2–1. On his 500th league appearance, Heskey scored his first goal for Wigan in a 1–0 Premier League victory over Reading on 26 August. He scored 8 goals in 36 appearances in the 2006–07 season, as Wigan avoided relegation on goal difference over Sheffield United, against whom Heskey played well on 13 May 2007, in a match he nearly scored a bicycle kick.

Heskey suffered a suspected broken metatarsal in September 2007, and made his return for Wigan in a 2–0 defeat to Arsenal in November. He picked up an ankle injury during Wigan&#x27;s 5–3 victory against Blackburn in December 2007. On 14 April 2008, Heskey scored a 90th minute equalising goal against Chelsea, which damaged their hopes of winning the Premier League. He went on to score Wigan&#x27;s equaliser against Tottenham Hotspur in the following match to give them a 1–1 draw, which proved to be his last goal of the 2007–08 season, which he finished with 4 goals in 30 appearances.

His first goal of the 2008–09 season came in Wigan&#x27;s fourth match, a 5–0 victory against Hull City at the KC Stadium. He hinted in October 2008 that he would be interested in leaving Wigan to play in the Champions League, although Wigan manager Steve Bruce hoped to persuade him to sign a new contract at the club. Heskey commented on reports of interest from Liverpool by saying &quot;It would be lovely. We&#x27;ll see how it goes.&quot; He scored his 100th goal in the Premier League against Portsmouth on 1 November 2008, which secured a 2–1 victory for Wigan. Dave Whelan, the Wigan chairman, hinted that Heskey could be transferred by Wigan in January 2009, as a fee would be received, whereas he would move on for free in the summer, which came after he had stalled on talks over a new contract. However, Bruce said he would only accept an offer for Heskey if it was &quot;outrageous&quot;. He later said he was confident of keeping Heskey at the club. Heskey picked up a hamstring injury during a match against Bolton Wanderers in December 2008, which resulted in him missing an FA Cup third round tie against Tottenham Hotspur. He later said he would stay at Wigan and see out his contract until the summer of 2009.

===Aston Villa===
Heskey signed for Aston Villa on 23 January 2009 for a £3.5 million fee on a three-and-a-half-year contract. He made his debut four days later against Portsmouth and scored with a shot from 20 yards, the first time he had scored on a club debut. He scored one more goal before the end of the season, with the opening goal in a 1–1 draw with West Ham United. He finished the 2008–09 season with 14 appearances and 2 goals for Villa.

He suffered from concussion after minutes into a Peace Cup pre-season friendly match against Málaga in July 2009. Heskey was reported to have said he was considering leaving Villa during the January 2010 transfer window, to help ensure he would be chosen for the England team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, to which manager Martin O&#x27;Neill responded by saying &quot;There are players at this club with England ambitions. I wouldn&#x27;t be overly concerned about all that yet.&quot; However, Heskey later denied he was seeking to leave Villa. O&#x27;Neill told him to &quot;build up a head of steam&quot; in February 2010, saying he was concerned that Heskey&#x27;s injuries were denying him from producing his best form. He started for Villa in the 2010 League Cup Final, in which they lost 2–1 to Manchester United. Heskey finished the 2009–10 season with 42 appearances and 5 goals.

His first appearance of the 2010–11 season came after starting in a 1–1 draw at Rapid Vienna in the Europa League play-off first leg. Under Gérard Houllier, who previously managed Heskey at Liverpool, the striker enjoyed a successful start to the 2010–11 campaign including winning goals in the local derbies with Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion.

On 7 May 2011, in Aston Villa&#x27;s home match against Wigan, Heskey barged into referee Mike Jones and continued to argue with him because he did not award a free kick for an alleged elbow by Antolín Alcaraz. Heskey received a yellow card for his behaviour and had to be restrained by teammates such as Brad Friedel and captain Stiliyan Petrov. He played for the remainder of the half, but had to be restrained again in the tunnel at the interval. Caretaker manager Gary McAllister chose to substitute him for Marc Albrighton at half-time, and Heskey was not allowed to remain at the stadium for the rest of the match. Despite his outburst, Heskey received no punishment from either Villa or The Football Association. Teammate Luke Young later said that Heskey was &quot;lucky he didn&#x27;t get sent off&quot;.

Heskey remained with Villa for one more season, in which he scored just once, in an August 2011 win over Blackburn. He was released in May 2012 after being told he would not be offered a new contract.

===Newcastle Jets===
Heskey signed for Australian A-League club Newcastle Jets on 21 September 2012 as their marquee player for the 2012–13 season. He made his debut in the Jets&#x27; 2–0 home defeat to Adelaide United, in which he was substituted in the 72nd minute for James Virgili. Heskey scored his first A-League goal in a 3–2 away win against Sydney FC on 13 October 2012. In five starts, Heskey put his goal tally up to five, with his goal against Sydney FC, followed by one goal against F3 Derby rivals the Central Coast Mariners, two goals against Melbourne Victory on 26 October and one goal against the Western Sydney Wanderers, which took him to joint top scorer of the league. The match against Melbourne featured &quot;Heskey Cam&quot;, which allowed the viewer to track Heskey&#x27;s movements with one camera throughout the match. Having finished 2012–13 with 9 goals in 23 appearances and earning a nomination for the Jets&#x27; Player of the Year award, Heskey signed a new contract for the 2013–14 season in April 2013. After scoring once in 19 appearances in the 2013–14 season, Heskey left the Jets to pursue a move to an English club.

===Bolton Wanderers===
After a successful trial Heskey signed for Championship club Bolton Wanderers on a short-term contract on 24 December 2014. He made his debut two days later as a half-time substitute for Robert Hall with Bolton 1–0 down at home to Blackburn, but after scoring the equalising goal in the 59th minute Bolton went on to win 2–1. His goal was set up by another 36-year-old forward who the club had signed that month, Eiður Guðjohnsen. Heskey was released by Bolton when his contract expired at the end of 2015–16 season. He subsequently retired from playing.

==Post-playing career==
Heskey joined Cheshire League One club Egerton in 2017 as a coach, alongside Jlloyd Samuel, Jim Cherneski and Dean Gorré. In May 2020 Heskey revealed that he was on a UEFA Management course and was looking to take up an internship with Leicester City&#x27;s women&#x27;s team as part of it. In September, he was appointed to an ambassadorial and mentoring role with Leicester City Women as they worked towards professional status, and tasked with supporting the club&#x27;s head of women&#x27;s football, Russ Fraser, with developing the academy. Fraser left a year later, and Heskey succeeded him as head of women&#x27;s football development. Leicester Women&#x27;s manager, Jonathan Morgan, was sacked on 25 November 2021 after the team began the 2021–22 FA WSL season with eight successive losses, and Heskey took over the role on an interim basis. Five days later, it was announced that Lydia Bedford would succeed Morgan as manager, but Heskey was allowed to prepare for the team&#x27;s upcoming League Cup tie against Manchester United. His sole match in charge was won on penalties, following a 2–2 draw in regular time.

On 18 August 2023, Heskey was appointed as a coach supporting the England U18s ahead of the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup as part of The Football Association and Professional Footballers&#x27; Association&#x27;s joint England Elite Coach Programme (EECP).

==International career==
===Youth level===
Heskey gained his first international recognition with the England national under-16 team, making his debut on 26 April 1994 as a substitute in 1–0 win over Portugal in their opening match at the 1994 UEFA European Under-16 Championship. His first start came two days later as England drew 1–1 with the Republic of Ireland. All four of Heskey&#x27;s under-16 caps came at this tournament, in which England were eliminated in the quarter-final by Ukraine, losing 7–6 on penalties after a 2–2 extra-time draw.

Heskey made his debut for under-18s on 16 November 1995 when starting against Latvia in 1996 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualification, scoring both goals in a 2–0 win in the second and 58th minutes. He played in all four matches for the team at the 1996 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, scoring in the 18th minute of the third-place match against Belgium as England won 3–2 after extra time. He finished his under-18 career with eight appearances and five goals.

Heskey went on to gain recognition with the under-21 team, making his debut after starting in a 0–0 draw with Poland on 8 October 1996; a year later on 30 May 1997, he scored against the same team in a 1–1 stalemate. Making his final appearance on 29 March 2000 in a 3–0 victory over FR Yugoslavia in a 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-off, he finished his under-21 career with 17 caps, in which he scored six goals. He was capped once by the England B team, against Chile on 10 February 1998, scoring a 90th-minute goal in a 2–1 defeat.

===Senior level===
Heskey was given his first call-up to the senior England team for a friendly against the Czech Republic on 18 November 1998, but did not play. He made his debut in a friendly against Hungary in Budapest in a 1–1 draw on 28 April 1999 and made his first start against Argentina at Wembley Stadium on 23 February 2000. That showing ensured he was in the England squad for UEFA Euro 2000. However, his two substitute performances in the tournament could not help England, as the team were eliminated in the group stage.

====2002 FIFA World Cup====
In September 2001, Heskey scored to &quot;make it five&quot; in England&#x27;s 5–1 win away in Germany in a qualifying match for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. This was accompanied by his DJ goal celebration, a celebration he popularised. Heskey was selected in the squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, and was used as a makeshift option to play in England&#x27;s left-wing role in the match against Sweden, but did not perform well out of his regular position. He scored against Denmark in England&#x27;s 3–0 victory, which saw England reach the quarter-finals of the tournament. He featured in the match where England were beaten 2–1 by the eventual champions Brazil.

====UEFA Euro 2004====
He and teammate Ashley Cole received abuse from some Slovakia supporters when England played them in a Euro 2004 qualifier in October 2002, which led to UEFA opening an investigation into the allegations. Slovakia were eventually forced to play their next home international behind closed doors.
Heskey&#x27;s place in the England squad had been placed under scrutiny in 2003 with the emergence of Wayne Rooney into the England squad. However, despite being criticised for his lack of international goals, he continued to be an integral part of the international squad and took over the captaincy from Michael Owen after he was substituted when England beat Serbia and Montenegro 2–1 in his hometown of Leicester in June 2003. Heskey was named in the England squad for UEFA Euro 2004, but failed to perform well, and was the subject of much criticism. He came on as a substitute while England were leading 1–0 against France and fouled Claude Makélélé on the edge of the penalty area, giving away a free kick from which France equalised. England eventually lost 2–1.

====2006 FIFA World Cup qualification====
Heskey was recalled into the England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Northern Ireland and Azerbaijan in 2005, after having been dropped following the match against Ukraine in August 2004. Since the emergence of Peter Crouch in the England squad, the possibility of a recall receded further.

====UEFA Euro 2008 qualification====
Heskey&#x27;s international appearances under manager Steve McClaren were limited, although he was recalled to the England squad in September 2007 for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers as cover for the injured Rooney against Israel and Russia, on the recommendation of Michael Owen, after stating that he wanted to play alongside Heskey. He started the match against Israel and played an important role in the England attack, and by featuring he became the first England player to be capped for England whilst playing for Wigan Athletic. Heskey also started the next match against Russia, fighting off competition from Peter Crouch for a place in the team, during which he created an assist for Owen&#x27;s second goal. He was widely praised for his performances in the two matches, with former England international Alan Shearer commenting, &quot;Never in a million years did I expect to be discussing whether Emile Heskey should keep his place ahead of Wayne Rooney but the Wigan striker was outstanding over both matches.&quot;

====2010 FIFA World Cup qualification====
Heskey was called into manager Fabio Capello&#x27;s first squad against Switzerland, but had to withdraw due to an injury. He was called into the squad for a friendly against the Czech Republic in August 2008 and came on as a 46th-minute substitute, in a match that finished 2–2. He featured in the following 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification victories against Andorra and Croatia. Heskey was alleged to have been racially abused during the match against Croatia, with monkey chants being heard from sections of the Croatia support, after which FIFA opened an investigation, and eventually fined the Croatian Football Federation £15,000 for the incident.

He played his 50th match for England in the 2010 World Cup qualifier against Belarus on 15 October 2008, after which he was credited as helping Wayne Rooney&#x27;s improved form in international matches, with the two forming an effective strike partnership and keeping Owen out of the team. He started in a friendly against Spain in February 2009, which drew an angry reaction by Villa manager Martin O&#x27;Neill, who wanted to know why Capello played Heskey after suffering from an injury. Heskey scored his first goal for England in six years against Slovakia, scoring England&#x27;s first in a 4–0 victory at Wembley Stadium. He picked up a hamstring injury during this match, which forced him into withdrawing from the squad. He scored in a 4–0 victory over Kazakhstan in a 2010 World Cup qualifier in June 2009, which was his first competitive goal for England in seven years.

====2010 FIFA World Cup====
Heskey was named in England&#x27;s preliminary 30-man squad for the 2010 World Cup on 11 May 2010 and was eventually chosen for the final 23-man squad on 1 June. Heskey injured England captain Rio Ferdinand during a training session on 4 June, which ruled Ferdinand out of the tournament. He started in England&#x27;s opening match, a 1–1 draw with the United States and assisted Steven Gerrard&#x27;s goal.

Heskey retired from international football on 15 July 2010, at the age of 32, having scored 7 goals in 62 appearances for England.

==Style of play==

Heskey played as a striker, being a mobile yet powerful targetman, gifted with pace, physical strength, and an ability to utilise his height to win aerial challenges; he was also an intelligent and hard working player, known for his movement and athleticism. His play was likened to &quot;a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon defences&quot;. His main contributions to the team lied in the way he held the ball up with his back to goal and drew defenders out, leaving space behind him for another player to score. He was credited as being an unselfish player who would link-up well with other players and create space or chances for teammates, allowing other forwards to benefit. He was not a prolific goalscorer, or particularly graceful or skilful from a technical standpoint, but was able to provide a significant number of assists when deployed as a second striker in an attacking partnership alongside another striker. He was quoted as saying &quot;Forwards are judged on their goalscoring but I like to think I bring a lot more to the game and I do get pleasure from assisting&quot;. He impressed the England staff with his versatility, as he could also play down the left wing, in addition to his usual role as an out–and–out striker; he also drew praise from managers and teammates over his selfless team-play. However, he was criticised by the media for his lack of goals and perceived poor mentality; lapses in his goalscoring were described as being &quot;hardly uncommon&quot;. It was stated in 2008 that &quot;It is only the perception of his talents that changes&quot; after Heskey stated he was no better or worse than before. Although primarily a forward, he was also used in a more withdrawn role on occasion during his time with Aston Villa, functioning as an attacking midfielder, whose role was to link-up the midfield with the attack, or even as a central midfielder.

==Personal life==
Heskey was the partner of Kylee Pinsent but left her in 2004 and married Chantelle (née Tagoe) in May 2014 at Rookery Hall, Cheshire. He started seeing Tagoe secretly in 2002, who worked part-time as a waitress at a lap-dancing bar in Liverpool, while still in a relationship with Pinsent. Following the revelation of his two-year affair with Tagoe, Pinsent broke up with Heskey. He is the father of six children, three of them with former partner Pinsent and three with Tagoe. His fiancée Tagoe was held at knifepoint at their home in Hale, Greater Manchester in July 2008, while he was at a training session. The thieves burgled the house and stole Heskey&#x27;s car but neither Tagoe, nor their two (at the time) children who were in the house, were hurt. Following this, he said Tagoe was &quot;very, very distressed&quot; by the incident. In 2009, he was rated as owning a personal fortune of £12 million. Heskey and other members of the England team supported the Shoe Aid for Africa campaign in 2009, which was aimed at helping underprivileged children in Africa.

Heskey&#x27;s sons Jaden and Reigan are youth team players for Manchester City. On 19 March 2023, Jaden scored in City EDS&#x27; 6–0 win over Manchester United.

In June 2024, Heskey was ordered to pay a bill for legal fees of almost £200k following a seven-year dispute with HMRC over an unpaid tax bill going back to 2019.

<doc id="344319" wikidata="Q724954" url="?curid=344319" title="Mesha Stele">
<text>The Mesha Stele, also known as the Moabite Stone, is a stele dated around 840 BCE containing a significant Canaanite inscription in the name of King Mesha of Moab (a kingdom located in modern Jordan). Mesha tells how Chemosh, the god of Moab, had been angry with his people and had allowed them to be subjugated to the Kingdom of Israel, but at length, Chemosh returned and assisted Mesha to throw off the yoke of Israel and restore the lands of Moab. Mesha also describes his many building projects. It is written in a variant of the Phoenician alphabet, closely related to the Paleo-Hebrew script.

The stone was discovered intact by Frederick Augustus Klein, an Anglican missionary, at the site of ancient Dibon (now Dhiban, Jordan), in August 1868. A &quot;squeeze&quot; (a papier-mâché impression) had been obtained by a local Arab on behalf of Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, an archaeologist based in the French consulate in Jerusalem. The next year, the stele was smashed into several fragments by the Bani Hamida tribe, seen as an act of defiance against the Ottoman authorities who had pressured the Bedouins to hand over the stele so that it could be given to Germany. Clermont-Ganneau later managed to acquire the fragments and piece them together thanks to the impression made before the stele&#x27;s destruction.

The Mesha Stele, the first major epigraphic Canaanite inscription found in the Southern Levant, the longest Iron Age inscription ever found in the region, constitutes the major evidence for the Moabite language, and is a &quot;corner-stone of Semitic epigraphy&quot;, and history. The stele, whose story parallels, with some differences, an episode in the Bible&#x27;s Books of Kings (2 Kings 3:4–27), provides invaluable information on the Moabite language and the political relationship between Moab and Israel at one moment in the 9th century BCE. It is the most extensive inscription ever recovered that refers to the kingdom of Israel (the &quot;House of Omri&quot;); it bears the earliest certain extrabiblical reference to the Israelite God Yahweh. It is also one of four known contemporaneous inscriptions containing the name of Israel, the others being the Merneptah Stele, the Tel Dan Stele, and one of the Kurkh Monoliths. Its authenticity has been disputed over the years, and some biblical minimalists suggest the text was not historical, but a biblical allegory. The stele itself is regarded as genuine and historical by the vast majority of biblical archaeologists today.

The stele has been part of the collection of the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, since 1873. Jordan has been demanding the stone slab&#x27;s return to its place of origin since 2014.

==Description and discovery==
The stele is a smoothed block of basalt about a meter tall, 60 cm wide, and 60 cm thick, bearing a surviving inscription of 34 lines.

Frederick Klein, an Anglican missionary, discovered the stone intact in August 1868 at the site of ancient Dibon (now Dhiban, Jordan). Klein was led to it by Sattam Al-Fayez, son of Fendi Al-Fayez, the tribal chief or emir of the Bani Sakher. Although neither of them could read the text. At that time, amateur explorers and archaeologists were scouring the Levant for evidence proving the historicity of the Bible. News of the finding set off a race among France, Britain, and Germany to acquire the piece.

A &quot;squeeze&quot; (a papier-mâché impression) of the full stele had been obtained just before its destruction. Ginsberg&#x27;s translation of the official report, &quot;Über die Auffindung der Moabitischen Inschrift&quot;, stated that Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, an archaeologist based in the French consulate in Jerusalem, sent an Arab named Yacoub Caravacca to obtain the squeeze as he &quot;did not want to venture to undertake the very costly [and dangerous] journey&quot; himself. Caravacca was injured by the local Bedouin while obtaining the squeeze, and one of his two accompanying horsemen protected the squeeze by tearing it still damp from the stone in seven fragments before escaping.

In November 1869, the stele was broken by the local Bedouins, the Bani Hamida, after the Ottoman government became involved in the ownership dispute. The previous year the Bani Hamida had been defeated by an Ottoman expedition to Balqa led by Mehmed Rashid Pasha, the head of Syria vilayet. Knowing that a demand to give up the stone to the German Consulate had been ordered by the Ottomans and finding that the ruler of Salt was about to put pressure upon them, they heated the stele in a bonfire, threw cold water upon it and broke it to pieces with boulders.

On 8 February 1870, George Grove of the Palestine Exploration Fund announced the find of the stele in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, attributing the discovery to Charles Warren. On 17 February 1870, the 24-year-old Clermont-Ganneau published the first detailed announcement of the stele in the Revue de l’Instruction Publique. This was followed a month later by a note from F. A. Klein published in &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; describing his discovery of the stele in August 1868:

Pieces of the original stele containing most of the inscription, 613 letters out of about a thousand, were later recovered and pieced together. Of the existing stele fragments, the top right fragment contains 150 letters, the bottom right fragment includes 358 letters, the middle right contains 38, and the rest contains 67 letters. The remainder of the stele was reconstructed by Ganneau from the squeeze obtained by Caravacca.

Visiting the site in 1872, Henry B. Tristram was convinced that the stele could not have been exposed for long and believed that it had probably been utilized as building material by the Roman era until thrown down in the Galilee earthquake of 1837.

Apart from that by Shmuel Ahituv, no authoritative full editions of the Moabite inscription exist. The translation used here is that published by James King (1878), based on translations by M. Ganneau and Dr. Ginsberg. Though line numbers included in the published version have been removed for the rendition below. A century and a half of scholarship has greatly improved our understanding of the text, so accessing other translations linked here, such as that by Ahituv, is recommended, rather than relying on this very outdated one.

I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned after my father. And I have built this sanctuary for Chemosh in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, and made me look upon all mine enemies with contempt.

Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he said, Let us go, and I will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and in the days of his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim.

And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and I placed therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men...women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh.

And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon.

I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, &#x27;Make you every man a well in his house.&#x27; And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I built Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim...Beth Baal-Meon, and I placed there the poor people of the land.

And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old. And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim, and take it. And I assaulted it, And I took it, for Chemosh restored it in my days. Wherefore I made... ...year...and I...

There is also a more modern translation by W.F. Albright on pages 320–321 of &quot;Ancient Near Eastern Texts&quot; (ed. Pritchard, 1969):

A yet newer translation was presented in a vici.org page authored by Jona Lendering, and an up-to-date academic text edition with a translation and commentary was published by Shmuel Ahituv in English in 2008, and in Hebrew in 2012.

==Interpretation==
===Analysis===

The Mesha Stele is the longest Iron Age inscription ever found in the region, the major evidence for the Moabite language, and a unique record of military campaigns. The occasion was the erection of a sanctuary for Chemosh in Qarho, the acropolis (citadel) of Dibon, Mesha&#x27;s capital, in thanks for his aid against Mesha&#x27;s enemies. Chemosh is credited with an important role in the victories of Mesha, but is not mentioned in connection with his building activities, reflecting the crucial need to give recognition to the nation&#x27;s god in the life-and-death national struggle. The fact that the numerous building projects would have taken years to complete suggests that the inscription was made long after the military campaigns, or at least most of them, and the account of those campaigns reflects a royal ideology that wishes to present the king as the obedient servant of the god. The king also claims to be acting in the national interest by removing Israelite oppression and restoring lost lands, but a close reading of the narrative leaves it unclear whether all the conquered territories were previously Moabite – in three campaign stories, no explicit reference is made to prior Moabite control. The town of Atoroth is very probably Khirbat Ataruz.

===Parallel to 2 Kings 3===
The inscription seems to parallel an episode in 2 Kings 3: Jehoram of Israel makes an alliance with Jehoshaphat king of Judah and an unnamed king of Edom (south of Judah) to put down his rebellious vassal Mesha; the three kings have the best of the campaign until Mesha, in desperation, sacrifices to his god Chemosh either his eldest son or the eldest son of the king of Edom; the sacrifice turns the tide, &quot;there came great wrath against Israel&quot;, and Mesha apparently achieves victory. This apparent correspondence is the basis of the usual dating of the inscription to about 840 BCE, but André Lemaire has cautioned that the identification is not certain and the stele may be as late as 810 BCE.

===Proposed references to David and &quot;House of David&quot;===

The discovery of the Tel Dan Stele led to a re-evaluation of the Mesha Stele by some scholars. In 1994, André Lemaire reconstructed BT[D]WD as &quot;House of David&quot;, meaning Judah, in line 31. This section is badly damaged, but appears to tell of Mesha&#x27;s reconquest of the southern lands of Moab, just as the earlier part dealt with victories in the north. Line 31 says that he captured Horonen from someone who was occupying it. Just who the occupants were is unclear. The legible letters were taken by Lemaire to be BT[*]WD, with the square brackets representing a damaged space that probably contained just one letter. This is not universally accepted—Nadav Na&#x27;aman, for instance, suggested it as BT[D]WD[H], &quot;House of Daodoh&quot;, a local ruling family. Were Lemaire correct, the stele would provide the earliest evidence of the existence of the Judean kingdom and its Davidic dynasty.

In 2001, Anson Rainey proposed that a two-word phrase in line 12—&#x27;R&#x27;L DWDH—should be read as a reference to an &quot;altar hearth of David&quot; at Ataroth, one of the towns captured by Mesha. The sentence reads: &quot;I (i.e., Mesha) carried from there (Atartoth) the &#x27;R&#x27;L of its DWD (or: its &#x27;R&#x27;L of DVD) and I dragged it before Chemosh in Qeriot&quot;. The meaning of both words is unclear. One line of thought sees &#x27;R&#x27;L as the name of a man (literally &quot;El is my light&quot;) and translates DWD as &quot;defender&quot;, so that the sense of the passage is that Mesha, having conquered Ataroth, dragged its &quot;defender&quot;, whose name was &quot;El is my light&quot;, to the altar of Chemosh, where he was presumably sacrificed. It seems more likely that some kind of cult-vessel is meant, and other suggestions have included &quot;the lion-statue of its beloved&quot;, meaning the city god.

In 2019, Israel Finkelstein, Nadav Na&#x27;aman and Thomas Römer concluded, on the basis of high-resolution photographs of the squeeze, that the monarch mentioned is referred to by three consonants, beginning with &#x27;B&#x27;, and the most probable candidate is not David, but Balak, a biblical Moabite. Disagreeing, Michael Langlois pointed to his own new imaging methods that &quot;confirm&quot; line 31 contains the phrase &quot;House of David&quot;. A similar judgment was expressed by biblical scholar Ronald Hendel, who noted that Balak lived 200 years before David and, therefore, a reference to it would not make sense; Hendel also dismissed Finkelstein&#x27;s hypothesis as &quot;nothing more than a guess&quot;. Matthieu Richelle argues that the supposed dividing stroke that Finkelstein, Na&#x27;aman and Römer cite as evidence that the name of the monarch began with a &#x27;B&#x27; does not appear on the stone itself, but as part of a later reconstruction made of plaster.

In 2022, the epigraphists André Lemaire and Jean-Philippe Delorme argued that newer photographs using Reflectance Transformation Imaging by a team part of the West Semitic Research Project of the University of Southern California in 2015, as well as high-resolution backlit pictures of the squeeze by the Louvre Museum in 2018, supported their view that line 31 of the Mesha Stele contains a reference to King David. This evidence is regarded as inconclusive by Matthieu Richelle and Andrew Burlingame, who hold that the reading &quot;House of David&quot; in the stele remains uncertain.

===Authenticity===
In the years following the discovery of the stele a number of scholars questioned its authenticity.

The stele is regarded as of genuine antiquity by the vast majority of biblical archaeologists on the basis that no other inscriptions in this script or language of comparable age were yet known to scholars at the time of its discovery. At that time the Assyrian lion weights were the oldest Phoenician-style inscription that had been discovered.

In 2010, the discovery of the Khirbat Ataruz Inscribed Altar inscriptions by archaeologist Chang-ho Ji at an ancient Moabite sanctuary site in Jordan provided further evidence for the Mesha Stele&#x27;s authenticity. The authenticity of the stele is considered wholly established and undisputed by biblical archaeologists.

===Minimalist views===
Thomas L. Thompson, a former professor of theology at the University of Copenhagen, closely associated with the Biblical minimalism movement known as the Copenhagen School, which holds that &quot;Israel&quot; is a problematic concept, believes that the inscription on the Mesha stele is not historical, but an allegory. In 2000, he wrote: &quot;Rather than an historical text, the Mesha inscription belongs to a substantial literary tradition of stories about kings of the past... The phrase &quot;Omri, king of Israel,&quot; eponym of the highland patronate &quot;Bit Humri&quot;, belongs to a theological world of Narnia.&quot; This view has received criticism by John Emerton and André Lemaire, who have both reasserted the historical value of the Mesha Stele.

<doc id="344325" wikidata="Q666662" url="?curid=344325" title="Janko Bobetko">
<text>Janko Bobetko (10 January 1919 – 29 April 2003) was a Croatian general who had participated in World War II and later in the Croatian War of Independence. He was one of the founding members of 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment, the first anti-fascist military unit during World War II in Yugoslavia. He later had a military career in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA).

In 1992, Bobetko became the Chief of the General Staff of the Croatian Army (HV). He served in this capacity until his retirement in 1995. Bobetko had been charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia but died before he could be tried; a later verdict in another case found that he took part in the joint criminal enterprise against the non-Croat population during the Bosnian War.

==Biography==
Bobetko was born in the village of Crnac, Sisak in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He studied at the veterinary faculty in the University of Zagreb, but Croatian pro-Nazi authorities expelled him from university at the start of World War II for his anti-fascist views.

===World War II and Yugoslav army career===
In July 1941, he joined an antifascist unit, the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment in the Brezovica Forest near Sisak. Bobetko fought for the Yugoslav Partisans from 1941-45. His father and three brothers were killed by the Nazi-affiliated Ustashe. He was heavily wounded in the Battle of Sutjeska in Montenegro, but survived to become a Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) officer.

In the post-war period, he graduated from the Military Academy of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and rose to the rank of lieutenant-general. During the Croatian Spring period of the early 1970s, he supported greater autonomy for Croatia in Yugoslavia, and was demoted and expelled from the JNA in 1972 after Tito&#x27;s crackdown on perceived separatists and nationalists in the constituent parts of the former Yugoslavia.

===Service in independent Croatia===
After the 1990 Croatian parliamentary elections, Bobetko refused to accept the position of defense minister. His involvement in the Croatian War of Independence began in Banovina and continued on the Southern Front, where he took command on 10 April 1992. On 20 November 1992, Bobetko was named the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia.

In 1993, during Operation Medak pocket against Serb Krajina strongholds that controlled the town of Gospić, the Croatian soldiers were accused of committing crimes against humanity and violating the laws or customs of war, which Bobetko denied. In his 1996 memoir, &quot;All My Battles&quot;, which contained many military maps and commands, he wrote that the action—aimed at ending the Serbian bombardment of Gospić—was &quot;brilliant&quot;.

Bobetko had the status of a fully disabled person, caused both by his leg injury he sustained during World War II, and later by an onset of cardiac decompensation in 1994. Because of this he was hospitalized in 1995 during Operation Flash. The extent of his disability was at one point disputed by the Ministry of Defense, but it was later fully reinstated by a court order.

On 15 July 1995, shortly before Operation Storm, President Franjo Tuđman formally replaced Bobetko as the Chief of General Staff with Zvonimir Červenko. Later that year, he was elected in the 1995 Croatian parliamentary election on the electoral list of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and served as an MP until 1999.

In 2000, Bobetko was the most prominent signatory to the Twelve Generals&#x27; Letter. In September 2002, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia indicted Bobetko. He was the most senior Croatian officer sought at the tribunal. Bobetko refused to accept the indictment or surrender to the court, claiming the indictment questioned the legitimacy of the entire military operation, saying that &quot;&#x27;there is no court on earth to have tried an army which defended and liberated its country, nor will there ever be.&quot; He also accused the tribunal of seeking &quot;to erase our history, condemn our freedom and remove from our memories the proud days of the struggle for a free Croatia.&quot; The crisis stretched out as popular opinion agreed with Bobetko, and the anti-HDZ coalition government led by Social Democrat Prime Minister Ivica Račan would not assert an unambiguous position over his extradition. Račan himself criticised the indictment, and, in late September 2002, the Sabor unanimously passed a motion opposing the indictment charges, with moderate President Stjepan Mesić being the only major figure to consistently argue in favour of cooperation with the ICTY. The government adopted a strategy of delaying any further move until Bobetko&#x27;s health declined to the point where, in early 2003, the tribunal had deemed him unfit to stand trial. Some veteran groups also went further by guarding the general&#x27;s home, threatening violence if Račan&#x27;s government attempted to have Bobetko forcibly arrested and extradited to the Hague.

By that time, Bobetko was already gravely ill, as well. In 2002, the United Kingdom halted its ratification process for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement of Croatia with the European Union due to the Croatian government&#x27;s handling of the Bobetko case. A survey conducted by the Croatian Puls agency in late September 2002 claimed that 84% of Croatian citizens were opposed to extraditing him, and 71% would remain opposed even if the nation were threatened with political and economic sanctions.

Bobetko died in 2003, aged 84, before any final decision was reached regarding his extradition.

==Legacy==

Bobetko was survived by his widow, Magdalena, and three sons.

The treaty ratification problem was subsequently rectified in 2004.

In May 2013, the ICTY, in a first-instance verdict against Jadranko Prlić, found that Bobetko, Tuđman and Gojko Šušak took part in the joint criminal enterprise (JCE) against the non-Croat population of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War. In July 2016 the Appeals Chamber in the case announced that the &quot;Trial Chamber made no explicit findings concerning [Bobetko and others&#x27;] participation in the JCE and did not find [them] guilty of any crimes.&quot; In November 2017, the ICTY upheld the 2013 JCE verdict.

<text>James Arthur Lovell Jr. ( ; born March 25, 1928) is an American retired astronaut, naval aviator, test pilot and mechanical engineer. In 1968, as command module pilot of Apollo 8, he became, with Frank Borman and William Anders, one of the first three astronauts to fly to and orbit the Moon. He then commanded the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970 which, after a critical failure en route, looped around the Moon and returned safely to Earth.

A graduate of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in the class of 1952, Lovell flew F2H Banshee night fighters. This included a Western Pacific deployment aboard the aircraft carrier . In January 1958, he entered a six-month test pilot training course at the Naval Air Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, with Class 20 and graduated at the top of the class. He was then assigned to Electronics Test, working with radar, and in 1960 he became the Navy&#x27;s McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II program manager. The following year he became a flight instructor and safety engineering officer at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and completed Aviation Safety School at the University of Southern California.

Lovell was not selected by NASA as one of the Mercury Seven astronauts due to a temporarily high bilirubin count. He was accepted in September 1962 as one of the second group of astronauts needed for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Prior to Apollo, Lovell flew in space on two Gemini missions, Gemini 7 (with Borman) in 1965 and Gemini 12 in 1966. He was the first person to fly into space four times. One of 24 people to have flown to the Moon, Lovell was the first to fly to it twice. He is a recipient of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He co-authored the 1994 book &quot;Lost Moon&quot;, on which the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was based. Lovell was featured in a cameo appearance in the film.

==Early life==

James Arthur Lovell Jr. was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 25, 1928, the only child of James Lovell Sr., a Toronto, Ontario, Canada-born coal furnace salesman who died in a car accident in 1933 and Blanche née Masek, who was of Czech descent. For the first two years after the death of his father, Lovell and his mother lived with a relative in Terre Haute, Indiana. They then relocated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he went to Juneau High School. He was a member of the Boy Scouts during his childhood and eventually achieved Eagle Scout, the organization&#x27;s highest rank. He became interested in rocketry and built flying models as a teenager.
After graduating from high school, Lovell attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison for two years, where he studied engineering under the United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;Flying Midshipman&quot; program from 1946 to 1948. He would later credit the program for his ability to attend college, citing that he didn&#x27;t otherwise have the money to attend. At Wisconsin, he played college football and pledged to the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. He supplemented his meager Navy stipend by working at a local restaurant washing dishes and busing tables, and caring for the university&#x27;s lab rats and mice on weekends.

While Lovell was attending pre-flight training in the summer of 1948, the Navy was beginning to make cutbacks in the program, and cadets were under a great deal of pressure to transfer out. There were concerns that some or most of the students who graduated as naval aviators would not have pilot billets to fill. To avoid this prospect, Lovell decided to apply to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He secured a nomination from his local U.S. Representative, John C. Brophy, and entered Annapolis in July 1948.

During his first year, Lovell wrote a treatise on the liquid-propellant rocket engine. He graduated in the spring of 1952 with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned as an ensign in the Navy. On June 6, he married Marilyn Lillie Gerlach in a ceremony at St. Anne&#x27;s Church in Annapolis. The two had begun dating while they were in high school. As a college student, Gerlach had transferred from Wisconsin State Teachers College to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., so she could be near him while he was at Annapolis. They had four children: Barbara, James, Susan, and Jeffrey.

==Navy career==
Lovell was one of 50 members of his graduating class of 783 initially selected for naval aviation training. He went to flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola from October 1952 to February 1954. He was designated a naval aviator on February 1, 1954, upon completion of pilot training, and was assigned to VC-3 at Moffett Field near San Francisco, California. From 1954 to 1956 he flew McDonnell F2H Banshee night fighters. This included a Western Pacific deployment aboard the aircraft carrier . Lovell eventually completed 107 carrier deck landings. Upon his return to shore duty, he was reassigned to provide pilot transition training for the North American FJ-4 Fury, McDonnell F3H Demon and Vought F8U Crusader.

In January 1958, Lovell entered a six-month test pilot training course at what was then the Naval Air Test Center (now the United States Naval Test Pilot School) at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, with Class 20, which also included future astronauts Wally Schirra and Pete Conrad, who gave Lovell the nickname &quot;Shaky&quot;. Lovell graduated at the top of the class. Usually the top graduate was assigned to flight test on graduation, but the head of electronics test had complained about never getting the top graduate, so Lovell was assigned to electronics test, where he worked with radar sets.

Later that year, Lovell, Conrad, and Schirra were among 110 military test pilots selected as potential astronaut candidates for Project Mercury. Schirra went on to become one of the Mercury Seven, but Lovell was not selected because of a temporarily high bilirubin count. In 1960, electronics test was merged with armaments test to become weapons test, and Lovell became the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II program manager. During this time future astronaut John Young served under him. In 1961 Lovell received orders for VF-101 &quot;Detachment Alpha&quot; at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia, as a flight instructor and safety engineering officer, and he completed Aviation Safety School at the University of Southern California.

==NASA career==
===Astronaut selection===
In 1962, NASA began recruiting its second group of astronauts, intended to fly during the Gemini and Apollo programs. This time the process was a public one. Lovell found out about the selection from an advertisement that had been placed in &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot;, and decided to apply a second time. A three-person selection panel consisting of Mercury Seven astronauts Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton, and NASA test pilot Warren J. North, reduced the candidates to 32 finalists, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio for medical examinations. The tests there were much the same as those employed to select the Mercury Seven, but this time Lovell passed. The remaining 27 then went to Ellington Air Force Base near Houston, where they were individually interviewed by the selection panel.

On September 14, Slayton informed Lovell that he had been accepted. To avoid tipping off the media, all checked into the Rice Hotel in Houston under the name of Max Peck, its general manager. On September 17, the media crowded into the 1800-seat Cullen Auditorium at the University of Houston for the official announcement, but it was a low-key event compared to the unveiling of the Mercury Seven three years before. The group became known as the &quot;Next Nine&quot; or the &quot;New Nine&quot;. The new astronauts moved to the Houston area in October 1962. Conrad and Lovell built houses in Timber Cove, south of the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC). Developers in Timber Cove offered astronauts mortgages with small down payments and low interest rates. The MSC complex was not yet complete, so NASA temporarily leased office space in Houston.

The task of supervising the Next Nine&#x27;s training fell to Mercury Seven astronaut Gus Grissom. Initially, each of the astronauts was given four months of classroom instruction on subjects such as spacecraft propulsion, orbital mechanics, astronomy, computing, and space medicine. Classes were for six hours a day, two days a week, and all sixteen astronauts had to attend. There was also familiarization with the Gemini spacecraft, Titan II and Atlas boosters, and the Agena target vehicle. Jungle survival training was conducted at the United States Air Force (USAF) Tropic Survival School at Albrook Air Force Station in the Panama Canal Zone, desert survival training at Stead Air Force Base in Nevada, and water survival training on the Dilbert Dunker at the USN school at the Naval Air Station Pensacola and on Galveston Bay. Following the precedent set by the Mercury Seven, each of the Next Nine was assigned a special area in which to develop expertise that could be shared with the others, and to provide astronaut input to designers and engineers. Lovell became responsible for recovery systems.

===Gemini program===
====Gemini 7====
Lovell was selected as backup pilot for Gemini 4, which was officially announced on July 29, 1964. It put him in position for his first space flight three missions later, as pilot of Gemini 7 with command pilot Frank Borman, under a rotation system devised by Slayton. Borman was a USAF officer, and Lovell had first met him during the evaluation process for astronaut selection. Their selection for the Gemini 7 mission was officially announced on July 1, 1965, along with that of Edward White and Michael Collins as their backup crew.

Like all Gemini missions, it was part of the preparations for Apollo. The flight&#x27;s objective was to evaluate the effects on the crew and spacecraft from fourteen days in orbit, this being sufficiently long for any possible Moon mission, and would therefore enable doctors to evaluate the medical aspects of such a flight. Whereas the Gemini 6 mission preceding it was to demonstrate techniques for space rendezvous, likewise critical requirement of Apollo. These techniques had been worked out by Dean F. Grimm and Buzz Aldrin, who had written his doctoral thesis on the subject.

The Gemini 6 mission, which was commanded by Schirra with Tom Stafford as pilot, had a serious setback on October 15, 1965, when the Agena target vehicle that Gemini 6 was supposed to rendezvous with exploded soon after takeoff. Lovell was present at the Launch Control Center at Cape Kennedy when this occurred. Officials from McDonnell, the manufacturer of the Gemini spacecraft, then raised the possibility of a rendezvous between Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 during the two weeks while Gemini 7 was in orbit. The only change to the latter&#x27;s flight plan this required was to circularize its orbit to match that intended for the Agena target vehicle. Borman rejected a proposal by Schirra that Lovell and Stafford exchange places, on the grounds that it was hazardous and likely to jeopardize the fourteen-day mission objective through loss of oxygen.

In planning the mission, it was decided that both astronauts would sleep at the same time and observe the same work periods, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Experiments were not scheduled, but fitted in when time allowed. Of the twenty experiments, eight were medical, aimed at gathering data about the effects of long-duration space flight. Of the rest, four were tests of spacecraft systems, five involved radiometry or navigation, and three involved photography and observation, To save space, the G5C space suit was designed that incorporated a soft hood instead of a helmet and zippers instead of a neck ring. It weighed a third less than the standard Gemini space suit and could be stowed more easily.

Gemini 7 lifted off on December 4, 1965, and reached its intended near-circular orbit. Lovell was taller than Borman and had more difficulty donning and removing his space suit. Initially one astronaut had to be suited, but this made him uncomfortably warm, and eventually mission control relented and allowed both to leave their space suits off. Gemini 6, now called Gemini 6A, attempted to launch on December 12; the engines ignited, but shut down less than two seconds later due to an electrical problem and a fuel cap accidentally having been left in place. After repairs, Gemini 6A successfully lifted off on December 15, and rendezvoused with Gemini 7 on Gemini 6A&#x27;s fourth orbit. The two spacecraft then flew in tandem for three orbits, the distance between them varying between . Gemini 6A returned to Earth on December 16.

In the final two days of the mission, Lovell had time to read part of &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; by Walter D. Edmonds. As in earlier long-duration flights, malfunctions accumulated as the flight wore on. Two of the thrusters stopped working. After the flight, this was traced to the fact that they had an old type of laminate in the thrust chamber instead of the new type that had been developed to solve this problem. This proved to be only an annoyance, but there was more concern over a loss of power in the fuel cells. By day thirteen, a warning light was illuminated continuously and it was feared that the cells, which were only giving partial output, might fail completely, and the mission might have to be cut short; tests were carried out in St. Louis that demonstrated that the batteries could sustain them for the remainder of the flight. Gemini 7 made a successful return from orbit on December 18. The fourteen-day flight set an endurance record, making 206 orbits.

====Gemini 12====

On January 24, 1966, Lovell was named as the backup command pilot of Gemini 10, with Aldrin as the pilot. On March 21, this was changed as a result of the deaths of the Gemini 9 prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, in an air crash. The Gemini 9 backup crew of Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan became the prime crew of Gemini 9A, and Lovell and Aldrin became their backups. This positioned Lovell for his second flight and first command, of Gemini 12. Lovell and Aldrin&#x27;s selection for this mission was officially announced on June 17, along with that of Gordon Cooper and Gene Cernan as their backups.
The goals of Gemini 12, the final Gemini mission, were ill-defined at first. &quot;Essentially Gemini 12 didn&#x27;t have a mission&quot;, Lovell later recalled. &quot;It was, I guess, by default... supposed to wind up the Gemini program and catch all those items that were not caught on previous flights.&quot; By July, its mission had become to master extravehicular activity (EVA), something that had proven problematic on earlier Gemini missions, as they had been more strenuous than expected and performing simple tasks had been more complicated. A series of innovations had been developed in response to the problems that had been encountered. It had been found that moving in space was similar to being underwater, and Aldrin made use of this new training technique. A waist restraint was provided on the space suit, and the Gemini spacecraft and the Agena target vehicle had additional handrails, handholds, and rings for tethering the waist restraint. Procedures were modified to minimize fatigue.

Gemini 12 lifted off on November 11, and quickly achieved orbit. Its first task was to rendezvous with its Agena target vehicle. This was complicated when the rendezvous radar set failed. Instead, Aldrin, who had written his PhD on the rendezvous, used a sextant to measure the angle between the spacecraft and the Agena, and then calculated the required actions using the onboard computer. Lovell then flew the spacecraft accordingly. Rendezvous was achieved, and Gemini successfully docked with the Agena, achieving the fifth space rendezvous and fourth space docking with an Agena target vehicle. Lovell then successfully undocked and docked again.

Aldrin performed three EVAs. The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. It set an EVA record of two hours and twenty minutes. The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. He performed several tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for Apollo. The EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes. Before returning to the spacecraft, Aldrin cleaned the pilot&#x27;s window with a cloth, and Lovell jokingly asked him if he could change the oil too. A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.

Gemini 12 returned to Earth on November 15, after 59 orbits. During re-entry a pouch containing books and small pieces of equipment broke free and landed in Lovell&#x27;s lap. He did not want to grab it, as he feared he might pull on the D-ring that activated the ejector seat. It did not move any further, and the landing went well. The spacecraft landed just from the recovery ship, the aircraft carrier . Twelve experiments had been carried out. This mission proved that people could work effectively outside the spacecraft, which was required for the Apollo missions with the goal of getting man on the Moon by the end of the decade.

===Apollo program===
====Apollo 1====

On January 27, 1967, Grissom, White and Roger Chaffee were killed in the Apollo 1 fire. At the time, Lovell was in Washington, D.C., where, along with fellow astronauts Neil Armstrong, Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper and Richard Gordon, he had attended the signing of the Outer Space Treaty and the reception afterwards in the Green Room of the White House hosted by President Lyndon Johnson. Four days later, Lovell flew to West Point, New York, with Borman in a NASA T-38 for the funeral service for White at the Old Cadet Chapel. After the service, White was laid to rest in the West Point Cemetery; Lovell served as a pallbearer along with Armstrong, Borman, Conrad, Stafford and Aldrin.

The Apollo command module was redesigned after the fire, and afterwards it underwent a series of qualification tests. In April 1968, Lovell, along with fellow astronauts Stuart Roosa and Charles Duke, spent 48 hours in command module CM-007A, bobbing in the Gulf of Mexico to test the seaworthiness of the Apollo spacecraft. The NASA research vessel stood by with technicians and divers, while the astronauts assessed how quickly the spacecraft&#x27;s flotation devices could right it from the &quot;stable II&quot; (upside down) position. The urine collection hose was used to vacuum up water that entered the cabin. Although this did not seem to bother Lovell, Duke regarded it as his worst experience as an astronaut, and Roosa became quite seasick. The NASA &quot;Roundup&quot; newspaper wrote the event up under the headline, &quot;Yo, Ho, Ho and a Bottle of Marezine&quot;, referencing the brand name of a motion sickness drug.

====Apollo 8====

Lovell was originally chosen as command module pilot (CMP) on the backup crew for Apollo 9 along with Armstrong as commander (CDR) and Aldrin as lunar module pilot (LMP). Apollo 9 was planned as a high-apogee Earth orbital test of the Lunar Module (LM). Lovell later replaced Michael Collins as CMP on the Apollo 9 prime crew in July 1968 when Collins needed to have surgery for a bone spur on his spine. This reunited Lovell with his Gemini 7 commander Frank Borman, along with LMP William Anders. Aldrin became Lovell&#x27;s backup CMP, and Fred Haise joined Armstrong&#x27;s crew as LMP.

Construction delays of the first crewed LM prevented it from being ready in time to fly on Apollo 8, planned as a low Earth orbit test. It was decided to swap the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 prime and backup crews in the flight schedule so that the crew trained for the low-orbit test could fly it as Apollo 9, when the LM would be ready. A lunar orbital flight, now Apollo 8, replaced the original Apollo 9 medium Earth orbit test mission. The crew was informed of this decision on August 10, 1968, and the training schedule was adjusted accordingly. Starting in September, the crew spent ten hours a day in the simulator rehearsing the mission.

Apollo 8 was launched on December 21, 1968, and Borman, Lovell and Anders became the first crew to ride the Saturn V rocket, as well as the first to travel to the Moon. Their Apollo craft entered lunar orbit on December 24 (Christmas Eve) and reduced speed to go into a orbit. The engine was then fired again to enter a circular orbit around the Moon.

On Christmas Eve, the crew broadcast black-and-white television pictures of the lunar surface back to Earth. Lovell took his turn with Borman and Anders in reading a passage from the Biblical creation story in the Book of Genesis. They made a total of ten orbits of the Moon in 20 hours and ten minutes, and began their return to Earth on December 25 (Christmas Day) with a rocket burn made on the Moon&#x27;s far side, out of radio contact with Earth. When contact was re-established, Lovell broadcast, &quot;Please be informed, there is a Santa Claus.&quot;
As CMP, Lovell served as the navigator, using the spacecraft&#x27;s built-in sextant to determine its position by measuring star positions. This information was then used to calculate required mid-course corrections. Lovell used some otherwise idle time to do navigational sightings, maneuvering the module to view stars by using the Apollo guidance computer keyboard. Lovell accidentally erased some of the computer&#x27;s memory by entering the wrong codes, which caused the inertial measurement unit (IMU) to contain data indicating that the module was in the same relative orientation it had been in before lift-off; the IMU then fired the thrusters to &quot;correct&quot; the module&#x27;s attitude.

Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module&#x27;s attitude, they knew that they would have to reenter the correct data to tell the computer the module&#x27;s actual orientation. It took Lovell ten minutes to figure out the correct values, using the thrusters to get the stars Rigel and Sirius aligned, and another 15 minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer. Sixteen months later, during the Apollo 13 mission, Lovell would have to perform a similar manual realignment under even more critical conditions after the module&#x27;s IMU had been turned off to conserve energy.

A feature on the Moon&#x27;s surface (Mount Marilyn) was named by Lovell in honor of his wife.

The spacecraft splashed down safely before dawn on December 27 after 147 hours of flight, from the recovery ship, the aircraft carrier . It was estimated that the crew had traveled .

====Apollo 13====
Lovell was backup CDR of Apollo 11, with Anders as CMP, and Haise as LMP. In early 1969, Anders accepted a job with the National Aeronautics and Space Council effective August 1969, and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time. Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable.

Under the normal crew rotation in place during Apollo, Lovell, Mattingly, and Haise were scheduled to fly as the prime crew of Apollo 14, but George Mueller, the director of NASA&#x27;s Office of Manned Space Flight, rejected Slayton&#x27;s choice of fellow Mercury Seven astronaut Alan Shepard to command Apollo 13. Shepard had only recently returned to flight status after being grounded for several years, and Mueller thought that he needed more training time to prepare for a mission to the Moon. Slayton then asked Lovell if he was willing to switch places with Shepard&#x27;s crew to give them more training time. &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; Lovell replied, &quot;What could possibly be the difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14?&quot;

There was one more change. Seven days before launch, a member of the Apollo 13 backup crew, Duke, contracted rubella from a friend of his son. This exposed both the prime and backup crews, who trained together. Of the five, only Mattingly was not immune through prior exposure. Normally, if any member of the prime crew had to be grounded, the remaining crew would be replaced as well, and the backup crew substituted, but Duke&#x27;s illness ruled this out, so two days before launch, Mattingly was replaced by Jack Swigert from the backup crew. Mattingly never developed rubella and later flew to the Moon on Apollo 16.

Lovell lifted off aboard Apollo 13 on April 11, 1970. He and Haise were to land near the Fra Mauro crater. The Fra Mauro formation was believed to contain much material spattered by the impact that had filled the Imbrium basin early in the Moon&#x27;s history, and dating it would provide information about the early history of the Earth and the Moon.

During a routine liquid oxygen tank stir in transit to the Moon, a fire started inside an oxygen tank. The most probable cause determined by NASA was damaged electrical insulation on wiring that created a spark that started the fire. A problem with draining the tank had been reported before the mission, and Lovell had approved the action taken to turn on the heaters to purge the oxygen rather than to replace the faulty tank, which would have delayed the mission by a month. Neither he nor the launch pad crew were aware that the tank contained the wrong thermostat switch. The heaters were left on for eight hours, and while this successfully purged the oxygen, it also removed teflon insulation from the copper electrical wiring. Liquid oxygen rapidly turned into a high-pressure gas, which burst the tank and caused the leak of a second oxygen tank. In just over two hours, all onboard oxygen was lost, disabling the hydrogen fuel cells that provided electrical power to the Command/Service Module &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

Apollo 13 was the second mission not to use a free-return trajectory, so that they could explore the western lunar regions. Using the Apollo Lunar Module as a &quot;life boat&quot; providing battery power, oxygen, and propulsion, Lovell and his crew re-established the free return trajectory that they had left, and swung around the Moon to return home. Based on the flight controllers&#x27; calculations made on Earth, Lovell had to adjust the course twice by manually controlling the Lunar Module&#x27;s thrusters and engine.

Apollo 13 returned safely to Earth on April 17. &quot;I&#x27;m afraid&quot;, Lovell said, &quot;this is going to be the last lunar mission for a long time.&quot; His comment was rebutted by NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine, who hastened to reassure the public that NASA would be mounting more missions to the Moon. Nine months later, Apollo 14 would make the voyage to Fra Mauro, with modified oxygen tanks and an extra battery for emergencies.

Apollo 13&#x27;s flight trajectory gave Lovell, Haise, and Swigert the record for the farthest distance that humans have ever traveled from Earth. Lovell is one of only three men to travel to the Moon twice, but unlike the other two, John Young and Gene Cernan, he never walked on it. He accrued 715 hours and 5 minutes in space flights on his Gemini and Apollo flights, a personal record that stood until the Skylab 3 mission in 1973.

==Later life==

Lovell retired from the Navy and the space program on March 1, 1973, and went to work at the Bay-Houston Towing Company in Houston, Texas, taking on the role of CEO in 1975. He became president of Fisk Telephone Systems in 1977, and later worked for Centel Corporation in Chicago, retiring as an executive vice president on January 1, 1991. Lovell was a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. He was also recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with their Silver Buffalo Award.

Lovell served on the board of directors for several organizations, including Federal Signal Corporation in Chicago from 1984 to 2003, the Astronautics Corporation of America in his hometown of Milwaukee from 1990 to 1999, and Centel from 1987 to 1991.

In 1999, the Lovell family opened a restaurant in Lake Forest, Illinois, &quot;Lovell&#x27;s of Lake Forest&quot;. The restaurant displayed memorabilia from Lovell&#x27;s time with NASA and the filming of &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. The restaurant was sold to son and executive chef James (&quot;Jay&quot;) in 2006. The restaurant was put on the market for sale in February 2014, and it closed in April 2015, the property being auctioned the same month.

Marilyn Lovell (born on July 11, 1930) died of natural causes at the age of 93, at her home in the Lake Forest Place retirement community in Lake Forest, Illinois on August 27, 2023.

Upon the death of Frank Borman on November 7, 2023, Lovell became the oldest living former astronaut. he resides in a Chicago suburb.

==In popular culture==
About a month after the return to Earth of Apollo 13, Lovell and his crewmates, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with host Johnny Carson. In 1976, Lovell made a cameo appearance in the Nicolas Roeg movie &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;.

Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger wrote a 1994 book about the Apollo 13 mission, &quot;Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13&quot;, on which the 1995 Ron Howard film &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was based. Lovell&#x27;s first impression on being approached about the film was that Kevin Costner would be a good choice to portray him, given the physical resemblance, but Tom Hanks was cast in the role. To prepare, Hanks visited James and Marilyn Lovell at their home in Texas and flew with Lovell in his private airplane. Kathleen Quinlan was nominated for a supporting actress Oscar for her performance as Marilyn.

In the film, Lovell has a cameo as the captain of the . He can be seen as the naval officer shaking Hanks&#x27; hand, as Hanks speaks in voice-over, in the scene where the astronauts come aboard the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;. The filmmakers offered to make Lovell&#x27;s character an admiral aboard the ship, but Lovell said: &quot;I retired as a captain and a captain I will be.&quot; He was cast as the ship&#x27;s skipper, Captain Leland Kirkemo. Along with his wife Marilyn, who also has a cameo in the film, Lovell provided a commentary track on both the single disc and the two-disc special edition DVD.

Tim Daly portrayed Lovell in the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, and Pablo Schreiber in the 2018 film about Armstrong, &quot;First Man&quot;.

<doc id="344344" wikidata="Q735405" url="?curid=344344" title="Gongsun Yuan">
<text>Gongsun Yuan () (died September 238), courtesy name Wenyi, was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He rebelled against Wei in 237 and declared himself &quot;King of Yan&quot; (). In 238, the Cao Wei general Sima Yi led forces to Liaodong and successfully conquered Yan.

==Life==
Gongsun Yuan was a son of Gongsun Kang, a warlord who controlled Liaodong, Xuantu, Lelang and Daifang commanderies in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He became a vassal of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. When Gongsun Kang died, his sons Gongsun Huang and Gongsun Yuan were still too young at the time to succeed him, so his younger brother Gongsun Gong took over. In 228, a grown-up Gongsun Yuan seized power from his uncle Gongsun Gong and imprisoned him.

Although Gongsun Yuan was nominally a vassal of the Cao Wei state, he considered switching allegiance to Wei&#x27;s rival state, Eastern Wu. Gongsun Yuan eventually yielded under pressure from the Wei emperor Cao Rui. He killed the Wu delegates but some of them fled to Goguryeo. The Wu emperor Sun Quan attempted to form an alliance with Goguryeo to launch a pincer attack on Gongsun Yuan, but Goguryeo eventually sided with Wei against Gongsun Yuan.

In 237, the Wei emperor Cao Rui felt insecure about Gongsun Yuan&#x27;s influence in the northeast, so he sent the general Guanqiu Jian to lead an army of Chinese, Wuhuan and Xianbei troops to attack Gongsun Yuan, but floods caused the campaign to be aborted. Gongsun Yuan declared himself &quot;King of Yan&quot; () and concluded an alliance with Eastern Wu. The following year, the Wei generals Sima Yi and Guanqiu Jian led a campaign against Gongsun Yuan. Gongsun Yuan was defeated and killed while his clan was exterminated. As a consequence, Liaodong and present-day northwest Korea became Wei territories.

<doc id="344347" wikidata="Q2415936" url="?curid=344347" title="Scituate, Massachusetts">
<text>Scituate () is a seacoast town in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, United States, on the South Shore, midway between Boston and Plymouth. The population was 19,063 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The Wampanoag and their neighbors inhabited the area for thousands of years. The name Scituate is derived from &quot;satuit&quot;, the Wampanoag term for cold brook, which refers to a brook that runs to the inner harbor of the town.

European colonization brought a group of people from Plymouth about 1627, who were joined by colonizers from the county of Kent in England. They were initially governed by the General Court of Plymouth, but on October 5, 1636, the town incorporated as a separate entity. 
The Williams-Barker House, which still remains near the harbor, is believed to have been built in 1634. Twelve homes and a sawmill were destroyed in King Philip&#x27;s War in 1676. In 1710, several Europeans from Scituate emigrated to Rhode Island and founded Scituate, Rhode Island.

In 1717, the western portion of the original land grant was separated and incorporated as the town of Hanover, and in 1788, a section of the town was ceded to Marshfield. In 1849, another western section became the town of South Scituate, which later changed its name to Norwell. Since then, the borders have remained essentially unchanged.

Fishing was a significant part of the local economy in the past, as was the sea mossing industry. The sea was historically an integral part of the town with occasional incidents such as that described February 13, 1894, in which eight men clinging to the vessel&#x27;s rigging on a schooner grounded off Third Cliff apparently died before a large crowd watching from shore &quot;literally frozen to the ropes&quot; while unsuccessful rescue efforts continued through the day and their apparently lifeless bodies were covered by nightfall. A small fishing fleet is still based in Scituate Harbor, although today the town is mostly residential.

In 1810, a lighthouse was erected on the northern edge of Scituate Harbor. This lighthouse is now known as Old Scituate Light. During the War of 1812, a British naval raiding party having landed on the beach near the lighthouse was deterred by the two daughters of the lighthouse keeper. The young girls, Abigail and Rebecca Bates, marched to and fro behind sand dunes playing a fife and drum loudly. The British invaders were duped into thinking that the American army was approaching and fled. The girls and this incident became known as the &quot;American Army of Two&quot; or &quot;Lighthouse Army of Two&quot;. Descendants of the Bates family still remain in Scituate.

Another notable lighthouse, Minot&#x27;s Ledge Light, stands approximately off Scituate Neck. The Minot’s Ledge Lighthouse (also known as Minot’s Light) has been nicknamed the &quot;I Love You Lighthouse&quot; due to the 1–4–3 pattern that its light repeatedly emits.

Samuel Woodworth&#x27;s Old Oaken Bucket house is located in Scituate. The town is also home to the Lawson Tower, a water tower surrounded by a wooden façade, with an observation deck with views of most of the South Shore from the top.

Financier and muckraker Thomas Lawson built his Dreamworld estate in Scituate. The Lawson Tower remains and the Dreamworld condominium complex pays tribute.

During World War II, the Fourth Cliff Military Reservation defended the Scituate area with a battery of two 6-inch guns. It is now a recreation area for Hanscom Air Force Base.

Scituate used to be the site of international broadcasting radio station WNYW, which broadcast on the shortwave bands in the late 1960s.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 44.60%, is water. Scituate is bordered on the east by Massachusetts Bay, on the south by Marshfield, on the west by Norwell and Hingham, all of which are in Plymouth County, and on the northwest by Cohasset, in Norfolk County. The town is northeast of Brockton and southeast of Boston.

Scituate is considered a South Shore community, located just south of the mouth of greater Boston Harbor. The town is not contiguous; Humarock is a part of Scituate which can only be reached from Marshfield. The latter was formerly connected to the town, but that connection was lost when the mouth of the South River shifted northward as the result of the Portland Gale of 1898. The town&#x27;s shore varies, with the south (along the mouth of the North River) being surrounded by salt marshes, the middle (around Scituate Harbor) being sandy, and the coast of Scituate Neck (Minot) in the north exhibiting exposed granite bedrock. It is off these rocks that Minot&#x27;s Ledge lies, home to the town&#x27;s most famous lighthouse. The inland of the town is mostly wooded, with several brooks and rivers (including Satuit or &quot;Cold Brook&quot;, for which the town is named) running through.

Scituate has five public beaches: Minot, Sand Hills, Egypt, Peggotty, and Humarock.

The town has no freeways running through it; Massachusetts Route 3 runs through neighboring Norwell. Route 3A runs through the town, and is known as Chief Justice Cushing Highway for this stretch, named for Chief Justice William Cushing (1732–1810). The only other state highway in town is Route 123, which terminates at Route 3A, just from the town line.

There is no air service in town; the closest regional airport is Marshfield Municipal Airport, and the closest national and international air service is at Logan International Airport in Boston. There are two MBTA commuter rail stations. One is just off Route 3A in North Scituate, and the other is just east of the intersection of Routes 3A and 123 in the Greenbush neighborhood, which is the line&#x27;s eastern terminus. The line is connected to an existing line in Braintree, providing service to South Station in Boston.

Named places in the town include:
* Egypt
* First Cliff
* Greenbush (Green Bush)
* Hatherly
* Humarock
* Lawson Tower, a historic water tower which is visible from several miles out at sea
* Minot, including Minot Beach
* North Scituate (formerly &quot;Gannett Corner&quot;)
* Peggotty Beach

* Shore Acres
* Sodham
* The Glades
* Sand Hills
* The Connolly House
* Third Cliff
* Kent Village
* The West End
* The Spit
* The Point (original name of the Spit)
* Driftway

&quot;The Harbor&quot; refers to the business district as well as the harbor itself. Scituate Harbor is used mostly by pleasure boaters and fishermen.

At one time, dozens of commercial fishermen lived in Scituate, but the number has dwindled to just a handful.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 18,133 people, 6,694 households, and 4,920 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 7,685 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 96.1% White, 0.8% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 1.4% from other races, and 0.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.83% of the population.

There were 6,694 households, out of which 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.5% were married couples living together, 8.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.5% were non-families. 22.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 3.13.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 26.1% under the age of 18, 4.2% from 18 to 24, 27.7% from 25 to 44, 26.8% from 45 to 64, and 15.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.9 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $70,868, and the median income for a family was $86,058 (these figures had risen to $86,723 and $108,138 respectively as of a 2010 estimate)16. Males had a median income of $60,322 versus $40,200 for females. The per capita income for the town was $33,940. About 1.4% of families and 2.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.5% of those under age 18 and 4.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Climate==

In a typical year, Scituate&#x27;s temperatures fall below for 184 days per year. Annual precipitation is typically per year (high for the US) and snow covers the ground on no days per year or 0% of the year (the lowest in the US). It may be helpful to understand the yearly precipitation by imagining nine straight days of moderate rain per year. The humidity is below 60% for approximately 34.4 days, or 9.4% of the year.

The town is highly prone to the effects of nor&#x27;easters, major storms that slam the region every winter. The strongest of these storms can produce devastating coastal flooding and hurricane force winds in Scituate and other coastal Massachusetts towns.

==Transportation==

There are no divided highways that run through Scituate, but there are two state roads, Route 3A and Route 123. The nearest airport to Scituate is Marshfield Municipal Airport. The nearest national and international air service can be reached at Logan International Airport in Boston. T. F. Green Airport, located outside Providence, Rhode Island, is an alternative to Logan, although it is located farther away.

The Greenbush Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail begins in Scituate with the Greenbush station, proceeds north to Scituate&#x27;s second stop, in North Scituate, where it continues to Cohasset and Hingham and finally South Station in Boston. The ride into Boston lasts approximately forty- five minutes.

In late 2015, the GATRA bus program was implemented in Scituate. The program provides low-cost bus transportation within the town.

==Government==

On the national level, Scituate is a part of Massachusetts&#x27;s 8th congressional district, and is currently represented by Stephen Lynch.

On the state level, all of Scituate&#x27;s voting precincts are represented in the Massachusetts House of Representatives as a part of the Fourth Plymouth district, which also includes the town of Marshfield. Patrick Kearney was elected on November 6, 2018, as the state representative for these precincts. He will replace Jim Cantwell, who resigned to take a job with Ed Markey. Kearney was sworn in on January 2, 2019. The third precinct is a part of the Third Plymouth district, which includes Hingham, Hull and Cohasset, and is represented by Joan Meschino. The town is represented in the Massachusetts Senate as a part of the Plymouth and Norfolk district, which includes the towns of Cohasset, Duxbury, Hingham, Hull, Marshfield Norwell and Weymouth.

Scituate is governed on the local level by the open town meeting form of government, and is led by a town administrator and a board of selectmen. The town hall, police and fire station 3 are all located in buildings along Route 3A, just down the street from the traditional center of town. There is also a firehouse in Humarock and the Fire Headquarters is on First Parish Rd near Scituate Harbor. Emergency services are also provided by the town, with the nearest hospitals being located in Quincy, Weymouth, Plymouth, and Brockton. There are four post offices throughout the town, located in Humarock, near the harbor, in North Scituate and in Greenbush. The Scituate Town Library is located near Scituate Center, and is a member of the Old Colony Library Network (OCLN). The town also operates a highway department, as well as several parks, beaches and marinas. The Coast Guard also has a station at Scituate Harbor.

In 2002, Scituate voters adopted the Community Preservation Act (CPA) for the acquisition, preservation, restoration or creation of open space, historical purposes, land for recreational use and the creation and support of community housing. 

Since then, voters have approved funding for many noteworthy projects: restoration of historic treasures like Lawson Tower, Cudworth House, and Stockbridge Mill, and Old Scituate Light; purchase of increasingly threatened open space—more than 400 acres to date containing much wildlife and scenic trails; acquisition of the Mordecai Lincoln Homestead on the Gulf River (owned by Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s great, great, great grandfather); and construction of recreational facilities at Hatherly and Cushing Schools, the athletic complex at Scituate High School, and several playgrounds and sports fields around town.

==Education==

Scituate&#x27;s public schools provide co-ed classes for grades K–12. Hatherly Elementary School, Cushing Elementary School, Wampatuck Elementary School and (the most recently opened) Jenkins Elementary School serve grades K–5, the newly opened Lester J. Gates Middle School, which bears the same name as the old Intermediate school, serves grades six through eight and was opened just in time for the 2017–2018 school year. Scituate High School serves 9–12. Scituate High&#x27;s teams are known as the Sailors, and their colors are blue, white, and black. The teams compete in the MIAA&#x27;s Divisions 2 and 3, in the Patriot League. Their chief rivals are Norwell and Cohasset, whom they border, and Hingham, whom they play in their annual Thanksgiving Day football game.

High school students may also choose to attend South Shore Vocational Technical High School in Hanover free of charge. Also, many students, specifically in high school, commute to private schools in and around Boston, most commonly, Thayer Academy and Archbishop Williams in Braintree, Boston College High School (boys only) in Dorchester, and Notre Dame Academy (girls only) in Hingham. Boston College High enrolled 61 young men from Scituate in the 2005–06 school year.

==Culture==
===St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade===
The annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade takes place on the third Sunday in March and runs from Greenbush-Driftway to Scituate Harbor. In addition to the parade, the celebration includes the Mad Hatter&#x27;s Ball, the Annual Mayor&#x27;s Race, and the St. Pat&#x27;s Plunge into the chilly Atlantic Ocean at Peggotty Beach. These events are fundraisers for local charities. With nearly 50% of Scituate residents being of Irish descent, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day festivities are a local favorite.

According to the official parade website, the parade began in Minot, Massachusetts, in 1995 as a small procession around the block to celebrate St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

===Heritage Days===
An annual outdoor event in the Scituate Harbor area featuring live music, entertainment, artisan crafts, kids activities and historical site visits.
The event takes place for one weekend in the month of August.

<text>The North Riding of Yorkshire was a subdivision of Yorkshire, England, alongside York, the East Riding and West Riding. The riding&#x27;s highest point was at Mickle Fell at .

From the Restoration it was used as a lieutenancy area, having been previously part of the Yorkshire lieutenancy. Each riding was treated as a county for many purposes, such as quarter sessions. An administrative county, based on the riding, was created with a county council in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888. In 1974 both the administrative county and the North Riding of Yorkshire lieutenancy were abolished, replaced in most of the riding by the non-metropolitan county and lieutenancy of North Yorkshire, and in the north-west by County Durham.

==History==
Archives from 1808 record that the &quot;north-riding of York-shire&quot; had once consisted of &quot;fifty-one lordships&quot; owned by Robert the Bruce. During the English Civil War, the North Riding predominantly supported the royalist cause, while other areas of Yorkshire tended to support the parliamentarians.

==Governance==
===Administrative county===
The County of York, North Riding administrative county was formed in 1889. In 1894 it was divided into municipal boroughs, urban districts and rural districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Middlesbrough had already been incorporated as a municipal borough in 1853 and formed a county borough, exempt from county council control, from 1889. Richmond and Scarborough had been incorporated as municipal boroughs in 1835, with Thornaby-on-Tees added in 1892.

The urban districts in 1894 were Eston, Guisborough, Hinderwell, Kirkleatham, Kirklington cum Upsland, Loftus, Malton, Masham, Northallerton, Pickering, Redcar, Saltburn and Marske by the Sea, Scalby, Skelton and Brotton and Whitby. In 1922 Redcar was incorporated as a borough.

The rural districts in 1894 were Aysgarth, Bedale, Croft, Easingwold, Flaxton, Guisborough, Helmsley, Kirkby Moorside, Leyburn, Malton, Masham, Middlesbrough, Northallerton, Pickering, Reeth, Richmond, Scarborough, Startforth, Stokesley, Thirsk, Wath and Whitby.

County Review Orders reduced the number of urban and rural districts in the county:
*Hinderwell urban district was absorbed by Whitby rural district in 1932
*A new Saltburn and Marske by the Sea urban district was formed from Saltburn by the Sea urban district and part of Guisborough rural district. the remainder of Guisborough RD passed to Loftus urban district and Whitby rural district in 1932
*Kirklington cum Upsland urban district was absorbed by Bedale rural district in 1934
*Masham urban district was redesignated as Masham rural district in 1934

In 1968 a new Teesside county borough was created, taking in Middlesbrough and parts of the administrative areas of Durham and North Riding councils. From the North Riding came the Redcar Borough and Saltburn-Marske Urban District, Thornaby-on-Tees Borough (formerly part of the Stokesley&#x27;s rural district) and Eston&#x27;s urban district. Tees-Side also included parts north of the River Tees historically in Durham. The area was associated with the North Riding for lieutenancy and other purposes.

The main towns of the riding (before its authority was abolished) were Middlesbrough, Redcar, Whitby, Scarborough and Northallerton.

===Post-1974===

In 1974 the North Riding authorities were abolished. The majority of its former area became North Yorkshire, with the addition of northern West Riding and north-western pre-1974 East Riding. The former Teesside county borough and areas around it became part of Cleveland county while the Startforth Rural District came under County Durham.

Most of the former riding is now represented by the larger North Yorkshire District. The boroughs of Middlesbrough and Redcar and Cleveland are wholly inside the former North Riding&#x27;s area. They are also some parts of the former area in the council areas of Stockton-on-Tees, York and County Durham.

==Proposed resurrection of name==
On three occasions a re-use of the name of the North Riding for local government purposes has been considered. During the 1990s UK local government reform, the Banham Commission suggested uniting Richmondshire, Hambleton, Ryedale and Scarborough districts in a new unitary authority called North Riding of Yorkshire. Later, the government proposed renaming the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire the North Riding of Yorkshire. This was deemed inappropriate and rejected, after a &quot;chorus of disapprobation&quot;.

During a further local government review in the 2000s as part of the preparations for the regional assembly referendums, a unitary authority with the name North Riding of Yorkshire, consisting of Richmondshire, Hambleton, Ryedale and Scarborough was again suggested. However, the Commission withdrew this in favour or two unitary authorities, one for Hambleton and Richmondshire, the other for Ryedale and Scarborough.

==Ancient divisions==

Yorkshire was divided into wapentakes within each riding.

===Later wapentakes===
There were 13 wapentakes when the system became disused after the 19th century:
===Domesday===
In the Domesday Book of 1086 they were 
eight wapentakes, these were as follows:

<text>The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Fortunes and Adversities ( ) is a Spanish novella, published anonymously because of its anticlerical content. It was published simultaneously in three cities in 1554: Alcalá de Henares, Burgos and Antwerp. The Alcalá de Henares edition adds some episodes which were most likely written by a second author. It is most famous as the book establishing the style of the picaresque satirical novel.

==Summary==
Lázaro is a boy of humble origins from Salamanca. After his stepfather is accused of thievery, his mother asks a wily blind beggar to take on Lazarillo (little Lázaro) as his apprentice. Lázaro develops his cunning while serving the blind beggar and several other masters, while also learning to take on his father&#x27;s practice.

Table of contents:
*Prologue
*Chapter* 1: childhood and apprenticeship to a blind man.
*Chapter* 2: serving a priest.

*Chapter* 5: serving a pardoner.
*Chapter* 6: serving a chaplain.
*Chapter* 7: serving a pardoner and an archpriest.

*(or &quot;treatise&quot;)

==Importance as a novella==
Besides its importance in the Spanish literature of the Golden Age, &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; is credited with founding a literary genre, the picaresque novel, from the Spanish word &quot;pícaro&quot;, meaning &quot;rogue&quot; or &quot;rascal.&quot; In novels of this type, the adventures of the &quot;pícaro&quot; expose injustice while amusing the reader. This extensive genre includes Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Rinconete y Cortadillo&quot; and &quot;El coloquio de los perros&quot;, Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot; and Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Its influence extends to twentieth century novels, dramas and films featuring the &quot;anti-hero&quot;.

==Prohibition==
&quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; was banned by the Spanish Crown and included in the &quot;Index of Forbidden Books&quot; of the Spanish Inquisition; this was at least in part due to the book&#x27;s anti-clerical flavor. In 1573, the Crown allowed circulation of a version which omitted Chapters 4 and 5 and assorted paragraphs from other parts of the book. An unabridged version did not appear in Spain until the nineteenth century. It was the Antwerp version that circulated throughout Europe, translated into French (1560), English (1576), Dutch (after the northern, largely Protestant Seven Provinces of the Low Countries revolted against Spain in 1579), German (1617), and Italian (1622).

==Literary significance and criticism==

The primary objections to &quot;Lazarillo&quot; had to do with its vivid and realistic descriptions of the world of the pauper and the petty thief. The &quot;worm&#x27;s eye view&quot; of society contrasted sharply with the more conventional literary focus on superhuman exploits recounted in chivalric romances such as the hugely popular &quot;Amadís de Gaula&quot;. In Antwerp, it followed the tradition of the impudent trickster figure Till Eulenspiegel.

&quot;Lazarillo&quot; introduced the picaresque device of delineating various professions and levels of society. A young boy or young man or woman describes masters or &quot;betters&quot; with ingenuously presented realistic details. But Lazarillo speaks of &quot;the blind man,&quot; &quot;the squire,&quot; &quot;the pardoner,&quot; presenting these characters as types.

Significantly, the only named characters are Lazarillo and his family: his mother Antoña Pérez, his father Tomé Gonzáles, and his stepfather El Zayde. The surname &quot;de Tormes&quot; comes from the river Tormes. In the narrative, Lazarillo explains that his father ran a mill on the river, where he was literally born on the river. The Tormes runs through Lazarillo&#x27;s home town, Salamanca, a Castilian-Leonese university city. (There is an old mill on the river, and a statue of Lazarillo and the blind man next to the Roman bridge [&quot;puente romano&quot;] in the city.)

Lazarillo is the diminutive of the Spanish name Lázaro. There are two appearances of the name Lazarus in the Bible, and not all critics agree as to which story the author was referring when he chose the name. The more well-known tale is in John 11 (John 11:41–44), in which Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. The second is in Luke 16 (Luke 16:19–31), a parable about a beggar named Lazarus at the gate of a stingy rich man&#x27;s house.

In contrast to the fancifully poetic language devoted to fantastic and supernatural events about unbelievable creatures and chivalric knights, the realistic prose of &quot;Lazarillo&quot; described suppliants purchasing indulgences from the Church, servants forced to die with their masters on the battlefield (as Lazarillo&#x27;s father did), thousands of refugees wandering from town to town, poor beggars flogged away by whips because of the lack of food. The anonymous author included many popular sayings and ironically interpreted popular stories.

The Prologue with Lázaro&#x27;s extensive protest against injustice is addressed to a high-level cleric, and five of his eight masters in the novel serve the church. &quot;Lazarillo&quot; attacked the appearance of the church and its hypocrisy, though not its essential beliefs, a balance not often present in following picaresque novels.

Besides creating a new genre, &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; was critically innovative in world literature in several aspects:
#Long before &quot;&quot; (Jean-Jacques Rousseau). &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (Charles Dickens) or &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, the anonymous author of &quot;Lazarillo&quot; treated a boy as a boy, not a small adult.
#Long before &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; (Daniel Defoe), &quot;Lazarillo&quot; describes the domestic and working life of a poor woman, wife, mother, climaxing in the flogging of Lazarillo&#x27;s mother through the streets of the town after her black husband Zayde is hanged as a thief.
#Long before modern treatment of &quot;persons of color&quot;, this author treats sympathetically the pleasures and pains of an interracial family in his descriptions of life with his black stepfather and &quot;negrito&quot; half-brother, though their characterization is based on stereotypes.

==Reference in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;==
In his book &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Cervantes introduces a gypsy thief called Ginés de Pasamonte who claims to be a writer (and who later in Part II masquerades as a puppeteer while on the run). Don Quixote interrogates this writer about his book:
==Social criticism==
The author criticises many organisations and groups in his book, most notably the Catholic Church and the Spanish aristocracy.

These two groups are clearly criticised through the different masters that Lazarillo serves. Characters such as the Cleric, the Friar, the Pardoner, the Priest and the Archbishop all have something wrong either with them as a person or with their character. The self-indulgent cleric concentrates on feeding himself, and when he does decide to give the &quot;crumbs from his table&quot; to Lazarillo, he says, &quot;toma, come, triunfa, para tí es el mundo&quot; &quot;take, eat, triumph – the world is yours&quot; a clear parody of a key communion statement.

In Chapter 3, Lazarillo becomes the servant of a Squire. The Squire openly flaunts his wealth despite not being able to feed himself, let alone Lázaro. This is a parody of the importance of having a strong image among the nobility.

In the final chapter, Lazarillo works for an Archpriest, who arranges his marriage to the Archpriest&#x27;s maid. It is clear that Lazarillo&#x27;s wife cheats on him with the Archpriest, and all vows of celibacy are forgotten.

==Authorship==
The identity of the author of &quot;Lazarillo&quot; has been a puzzle for nearly four hundred years. Given the subversive nature of &quot;Lazarillo&quot; and its open criticism of the Catholic Church, it is likely that the author chose to remain anonymous out of fear of religious persecution.

Neither the author nor the date and place of the first appearance of the work is known. It appeared anonymously; and no author&#x27;s name was accredited to it until 1605, when the Hieronymite monk José de Sigüenza named as its author Fray Juan de Ortega. Two years later, it was accredited by the Belgian Valère André to Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. In 1608, André Schott repeated this assertion, although less categorically. The earliest known editions are the four of Alcalá de Henares, Antwerp, Medina del Campo, and Burgos, all of which appeared in 1554. Two continuations (or second parts) appeared – one, anonymously, in 1555, and the other, accredited to H. Luna, in 1620.

There has been some suggestion that the author was originally of Jewish extraction, but in 1492 had had to convert to Catholicism to avoid being expelled from Spain; that might explain the animosity towards the Catholic Church displayed in the book. Apart from the chronological difficulties this hypothesis presents, Catholic criticism of Catholic clergy, including the Pope, had had a long and even reputable tradition that can be seen in the works of famous Catholic writers such as Chaucer, Dante or Erasmus.

Documents brought to light by the Spanish palaeographer Mercedes Agulló in 2010 support the hypothesis that the author was, in fact, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. In 2023, researchers Mariano Calvo and José María Martínez have proposed and documented that the most likely author of &quot;El Lazarillo&quot; might be Juan de Valdés. They found their hypothesis on biographical, historical and linguistic recurrences between &quot;El Lazarillo&quot; and Valdes&#x27; works, and specially, Valdés&#x27; &quot;Diálogo de la lengua&quot;.

==Sequels==
In 1555, only a year after the first edition of the book, a sequel by another anonymous author was attached to the original &quot;Lazarillo&quot; in an edition printed in Antwerp, Low Countries. This sequel is known as &quot;El Lazarillo de Amberes&quot;, Amberes being the Spanish name for Antwerp.

Lázaro leaves his wife and child with the priest, in Toledo, and joins the Spanish army in their campaign against the Moors. The ship carrying the soldiers sinks, but before it does, Lázaro drinks as much wine as he can. His body is so full of wine that there is no place for the water to enter him, and by that means he survives under the sea. Threatened by the tuna fish there, Lázaro prays for mercy and is eventually metamorphosized into a tuna himself. Most of the book tells about how Lázaro struggles to find his place in tuna society.

In 1620, another sequel, by Juan de Luna, appeared in Paris. In the prologue, the narrator (not Lázaro himself but someone who claims to have a copy of Lázaro&#x27;s writings) tells the reader that he was moved to publish the second part of Lázaro&#x27;s adventures after hearing about a book which, he alleges, had falsely told of Lázaro being transformed into a tuna (obviously a disparaging reference to &quot;Lazarillo de Amberes&quot;).

==Non-literary influence==
Because of Lazarillo&#x27;s first adventures, the Spanish word &quot;&quot; has taken on the meaning &quot;guide&quot;, as to a blind person. Consequently, in Spanish a guide dog is still informally called a &quot;perro lazarillo&quot;, as it was called before &quot;perro guía&quot; became common.

<text>The Ryugyong Hotel (; sometimes spelled as Ryu-Gyong Hotel), or Yu-Kyung Hotel, is a tall unfinished pyramid-shaped skyscraper in Pyongyang, North Korea. Its name ( &quot;capital of willows&quot;) is also one of the historical names for Pyongyang. The building has been planned as a mixed-use development, which would include a hotel.

Construction began in 1987 but was halted in 1992 as North Korea entered a period of economic crisis after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After 1992, the building stood topped out, but without any windows or interior fittings. In 2008, construction resumed, and the exterior was completed in 2011. The hotel was planned to open in 2012, the centenary of founding leader Kim Il Sung&#x27;s birth. A partial opening was announced for 2013, but this was cancelled. In 2018, an LED display was fitted to one side, which is used to show propaganda animations and film scenes.

==Architecture==
The Ryugyong Hotel is tall, making it the most prominent feature of Pyongyang&#x27;s skyline and the tallest building in North Korea. Construction of the Ryugyong Hotel was intended to be completed in time for the 80th birthday of General Secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and President Kim Il Sung in 1992; if this had been achieved, it would have held the title of world&#x27;s tallest hotel. Before Goldin Finance 117 in China, it was considered the tallest unoccupied building in the world.

The building consists of three wings, each measuring long and wide, lightly stepped once but otherwise sloping at 75 degrees to the ground, which converge at a common point to form a pinnacle. The building is topped by a truncated cone wide, consisting of eight floors that are intended to rotate, topped by a further six static floors. The structure was originally intended to house five revolving restaurants, and either 3,000 or 7,665 guest rooms, according to different sources. According to Orascom&#x27;s Khaled Bichara in 2009, the Ryugyong will not be just a hotel, but rather a mixed-use development, including &quot;revolving restaurant&quot; facilities along with a &quot;mixture of hotel accommodation, apartments and business facilities&quot;.

==Construction history==
===Beginning===
The plan for a large hotel was reportedly a Cold War response to the completion of the world&#x27;s then-tallest hotel, the Westin Stamford Hotel in Singapore, in 1986 by the South Korean company SsangYong Group. North Korean leadership envisioned the project as a channel for Western investors to step into the marketplace. A firm, The Ryugyong Hotel Investment and Management, was established to attract a hoped-for $230 million in foreign investment. A representative for the North Korean government promised relaxed oversight, allowing &quot;foreign investors [to] operate casinos, nightclubs or Japanese lounges&quot;. North Korean construction firm Baikdoosan Architects &amp; Engineers (also known as Baekdu Mountain Architects and Engineers) began construction on a pyramid‑shaped hotel in 1987.

The hotel was originally scheduled to open in 1992 for the 80th birthday of Kim, but problems with building methods and materials delayed completion. If it opened on schedule, it would have surpassed the Westin Stamford to become the world&#x27;s tallest hotel, and would have been the seventh-tallest building in the world, now it was the tallest abandoned building in the world.

===Halt===
In 1992, after the building had reached its full architectural height, work was halted due to the economic crisis in North Korea following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Japanese newspapers estimated the cost of construction was $750 million, consuming 2 percent of North Korea&#x27;s GDP. For over a decade, the unfinished building sat vacant and without windows, fixtures, or fittings, appearing as a massive concrete shell. A rusting construction crane remained at the top, which the BBC called &quot;a reminder of the totalitarian state&#x27;s thwarted ambition&quot;. According to Marcus Noland, in the late 1990s, the European Chamber of Commerce in Korea inspected the building and concluded that the structure was irreparable. Questions were raised regarding the quality of the building&#x27;s concrete and the alignment of its elevator shafts, which some sources said were &quot;crooked&quot;.

In a 2006 article, ABC News questioned whether North Korea had sufficient raw materials or energy for such a massive project. A North Korean government official told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2008 that construction was not completed &quot;because [North Korea] ran out of money&quot;.

Though mocked-up images of the completed hotel had appeared on North Korean stamps during the initial construction period, the North Korean government ignored the building&#x27;s existence during the construction hiatus even though it dominated the Pyongyang skyline. The government manipulated official photographs in order to remove the unfinished structure from the skyline, and excluded it from printed maps of Pyongyang.

The halt in construction, the rumours of problems and the mystery about its future led foreign media sources to dub it &quot;the worst building in the world&quot;, &quot;Hotel of Doom&quot; and &quot;Phantom Hotel&quot;.

===Resumption===
In April 2008, after 16 years of inactivity, work on the building was restarted by the Egyptian construction firm Orascom Group. The firm, which had entered into a US$400 million deal with the North Korean government to build and run a cellular network, said that their telecommunications deal was not directly related to the Ryugyong Hotel work. In 2008, North Korean officials stated that the hotel would be completed by 2012, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim. In 2009, Orascom&#x27;s chief operating officer Bichara noted that they &quot;had not had too many problems&quot; resolving the reported structural issues of the building, and that a revolving restaurant would be located at the top of the building.

In July 2011, it was reported that the exterior work was complete. Features that Orascom had installed include exterior glass panels and telecommunications antennas. In September 2012, photographs taken by Koryo Tours were released, showing the interior for the first time. The photographs showed no wiring, cabling, or pipes in the structure, which was bare and unfurnished.

===Opening announced, then cancelled===
In November 2012, international hotel operator Kempinski announced it would be running the hotel, which was expected to partially open in mid‑2013. In March 2013, plans to open the hotel were suspended. Kempinski clarified its earlier statements, saying that only &quot;initial discussions&quot; had ever occurred, but that no agreement had been signed because &quot;market entry is not currently possible&quot;.

Kempinski did not elaborate on its reasons, but commentators suggested that international tensions related to the 2013 North Korean nuclear test, economic risks, and delays in construction probably played a part.

===Renewal===
Activity resumed in late 2016 and a representative of Orascom visited North Korea. In 2017 and early 2018, there were signs of work at the site, with access roads being constructed. 

In April 2018, a large LED display featuring the North Korean flag had been added to the top of the building. By May, an LED display had been added to one entire side of the structure, and there were reports that the building was being readied for occupation. By July, the LED display was showing animations and movie scenes. In June 2019, there was new signage bearing the hotel&#x27;s name (in Korean and English) and its logo over the main entrance. 

In 2024, the North Korean government reportedly started to look for a casino operator willing to complete the building in exchange for profits made by the casino.

<text>Mithridates I (also spelled Mithradates I or Mihrdad I; &quot;Mihrdāt&quot;), also known as Mithridates I the Great, was king of the Parthian Empire from 165 BC to 132 BC. During his reign, Parthia was transformed from a small kingdom into a major political power in the Ancient East as a result of his conquests. He first conquered Aria, Margiana and western Bactria from the Greco-Bactrians sometime in 163–155 BC, and then waged war with the Seleucid Empire, conquering Media and Atropatene in 148/7 BC. In 141 BC, he conquered Babylonia and held an official investiture ceremony in Seleucia. The kingdoms of Elymais and Characene shortly afterwards became Parthian vassals. In BC, while Mithridates was fighting the nomadic Saka in the east, the Seleucid king Demetrius II Nicator attempted to regain the lost territories; initially successful, he was defeated and captured in 138 BC, and shortly afterwards sent to one of Mithridates I&#x27;s palaces in Hyrcania. Mithridates I then punished Elymais for aiding Demetrius, and made Persis a Parthian vassal.

Mithridates I was the first Parthian king to assume the ancient Achaemenid title of King of Kings. Due to his accomplishments, he has been compared to Cyrus the Great (), the founder of the Achaemenid Empire. Mithridates I died in 132 BC, and was succeeded by his son Phraates II.

==Name==
&quot;Mithridates&quot; is the Greek attestation of the Iranian name &quot;Mihrdāt&quot;, meaning &quot;given by Mithra&quot;, the name of the ancient Iranian sun god. The name itself is derived from Old Iranian &quot;Miθra-dāta-&quot;. Mithra is a prominent figure in Zoroastrian sources, where he plays the role of the patron of &quot;khvarenah&quot;, i.e. kingly glory. Mithra played an important role under the late Iranian Achaemenid Empire, and continued to grow throughout the Greek Seleucid period, where he was associated with the Greek gods Apollo or Helios, or the Babylonian god Nabu. The role of Mithra peaked under the Parthians, which according to the modern historian Marek Jan Olbrycht, &quot;seems to have been due to Zoroastrian struggles against the spread of foreign faiths in the Hellenistic period.&quot;

== Background ==
Mithridates was the son of Priapatius, the great-nephew of the first Arsacid king, Arsaces I (). Mithridates had several brothers, including Artabanus and his older brother Phraates I, the latter succeeding their father in 176 BC as the Parthian king. According to Parthian custom, the reigning ruler had to be succeeded by his own son. However, Phraates I broke tradition and appointed his own brother Mithridates as his successor. According to the 2nd-century Roman historian Justin, Phraates I had made his decision after noticing Mithridates&#x27; remarkable competence.

== Reign ==
The kingdom that Mithridates inherited in 165 BC was one of the many medium-sized powers that had risen with the decline of Seleucid Empire or had appeared on its borders. Other kingdoms were Greco-Bactria, Cappadocia, Media Atropatene, and Armenia. Mithridates I&#x27;s domains encompassed present-day Khorasan Province, Hyrcania, northern Iran, and the southern part of present-day Turkmenistan.

===Wars in the east===

He first turned his sights on the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom which had been considerably weakened as a result of its wars against the neighbouring Sogdians, Drangianans and Indians. The new Greco-Bactrian king Eucratides I () had usurped the throne and was as a result met with opposition, such as the rebellion by the Arians, which was possibly supported by Mithridates I, as it would serve to his advantage. Sometime between 163–155 BC, Mithridates I invaded the domains of Eucratides, whom he defeated and seized Aria, Margiana and western Bactria from. Eucratides was supposedly made a Parthian vassal, as is indicated by the classical historians Justin and Strabo. Merv became a stronghold of Parthian dominance in the northeast. Some of Mithridates I&#x27;s bronze coins portray an elephant on the reverse with the legend &quot;of the Great King, Arsaces.&quot; The Greco-Bactrians minted coins with images of elephants, which suggests that Mithridates I&#x27;s coin mints of the very animal was possibly to celebrate his conquest of Bactria.

===Wars in the west===

Turning his sights on the Seleucid realm, Mithridates I invaded Media and occupied Ecbatana in 148 or 147 BC; the region had recently become unstable after the Seleucids suppressed a rebellion led by Timarchus. Mithridates I afterwards appointed his brother Bagasis as the governor of the area. This victory was followed by the Parthian conquest of Media Atropatene. In 141 BC, Mithridates I captured Babylonia in Mesopotamia, where he had coins minted at Seleucia and held an official investiture ceremony. There Mithridates I appears to have introduced a parade of the New Year festival in Babylon, by which a statue of the ancient Mesopotamian god Marduk was led along parade way from the Esagila temple by holding the hands of the goddess Ishtar. With Mesopotamia now in Parthian hands, the administrative focus of the empire relocated towards there instead of eastern Iran. Mithridates I shortly afterwards retired to Hyrcania, whilst his forces subdued the kingdoms of Elymais and Characene and occupied Susa. By this time, Parthian authority extended as far east as the Indus River.
Whereas Hecatompylos had served as the first Parthian capital, Mithridates I established royal residences at Seleucia, Ecbatana, Ctesiphon and his newly founded city, Mithradatkert (Nisa), where the tombs of the Arsacid kings were built and maintained. Ecbatana became the main summertime residence for the Arsacid royalty — the same city which had served as the capital of the Medes and as summer capital of the Achaemenid Empire. Mithridates I may have made Ctesiphon the new capital of his enlarged empire. The Seleucids were unable to retaliate immediately as general Diodotus Tryphon led a rebellion at the capital Antioch in 142 BC. However, an opportunity for counter-invasion arose for the Seleucids in when Mithridates I was forced to leave for the east to contain an invasion by the Saka.

The Seleucid ruler Demetrius II Nicator was at first successful in his efforts to reconquer Babylonia, however, the Seleucids were eventually defeated and Demetrius himself was captured by Parthian forces in 138 BC. He was afterwards paraded in front of the Greeks of Media and Mesopotamia with the intention of making them to accept Parthian rule. Afterwards, Mithridates I had Demetrius sent to one of his palaces in Hyrcania. There Mithridates I treated his captive with great hospitality; he even married his daughter Rhodogune to Demetrius. According to Justin, Mithridates I had plans for Syria, and planned to use Demetrius as his instrument against the new Seleucid ruler Antiochus VII Sidetes (). His marriage to Rhodogune was in reality an attempt by Mithridates I to incorporate the Seleucid lands into the expanding Parthian realm. Mithridates I then punished the Parthian vassal kingdom of Elymais for aiding the Seleucids–he invaded the region once more and captured two of their major cities.

Around the same period, Mithridates I conquered the southwestern Iranian region of Persis and installed Wadfradad II as its &quot;frataraka&quot;; he granted him more autonomy, most likely in an effort to maintain healthy relations with Persis as the Parthian Empire was under constant conflict with the Saka, Seleucids, and the Mesenians. He was seemingly the first Parthian monarch to have an influence on the affairs of Persis. The coinage of Wadfradad II shows influence from the coins minted under Mithridates I. Mithridates I died in , and was succeeded by his son Phraates II.

== Coinage and Imperial ideology ==

Since the early 2nd century BC, the Arsacids had begun adding obvious signals in their dynastic ideology, which emphasized their association with the heritage of the ancient Achaemenid Empire. Examples of these signs included a fictitious claim that the first Arsacid king, Arsaces I () was a descendant of the Achaemenid King of Kings, Artaxerxes II (). Achaemenid titles were also assumed by the Arsacids; Mithridates I was the first Arsacid ruler who adopted the former Achaemenid title of &quot;King of Kings&quot;. Though Mithridates I was the first to readopt the title, it was not commonly used among Parthian rulers until the reign of his nephew and namesake Mithridates II, from c. 109/8 BC onwards. 

The Arsacid monarchs preceding Mithridates I are depicted on the obverse of their coins with a soft cap, known as the &quot;bashlyk&quot;, which had also been worn by Achaemenid satraps. On the reverse, there is a seated archer, dressed in an Iranian riding costume. The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap as well, however coins from the later part of his reign show him for the first time wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. He thus embraces the image of a Hellenistic monarch, yet chooses to appear bearded in the traditional Iranian custom. Mithridates I also titled himself &quot;Philhellene&quot; (&quot;friend of the Greeks&quot;) on his coins, which was a political act done in order to establish friendly relations with his newly conquered Greek subjects and cooperate with its elite. On the reverse of his new coins, the Greek divine hero Heracles is depicted, holding a club in his left hand and a cup in his right hand. In the Parthian era, Iranians used Hellenistic iconography to portray their divine figures, thus Heracles was seen as a representation of the Avestan Verethragna.

The other titles that Mithridates I used in his coinage was &quot;of Arsaces&quot;, which was later changed into &quot;of King Arsaces&quot;, and eventually, &quot;of the Great King Arsaces.&quot; The name of the first Arsacid ruler Arsaces I had become a royal honorific among the Arsacid monarchs out of admiration for his achievements. Another title used in Mithridates&#x27; coinage was &quot;whose father is a god&quot;, which was also later used by his son, Phraates II.

== Building activities ==
Under Mithridates I, the city of Nisa, which served as a royal residence of the Arsacids, was completely transformed. Renamed Mithradatkert (&quot;Mithridates&#x27; fortress&quot;), the city was made into a religious hub that was dedicated to promote the worship of Arsacid family. A sculpted head broken off from a larger statue from Mithradatkert, depicting a bearded man with noticeably Iranian facial characteristics, may be a portrait of Mithridates I. Ctesiphon, a city on the Tigris next to Seleucia, was founded during his reign. According to Strabo, the city was established as a camp for the Parthian troops, due to Arsacids not finding it suitable to send them into Seleucia. Pliny the Elder, however, states that Ctesiphon was founded in order to lure the inhabitants of Seleucia out of their city.

== The Xong-e Noruzi relief ==

One of the most famous Parthian reliefs is a scene with six men at Xong-e Noruzi in Khuzestan. In the middle of the figure, the main character is in frontal view in Parthian costume. To the right are three other slightly smaller men. On the left is a rider on a horse. The figure is shown in profile. Behind the rider is another man, also in profile. The stylistic difference between the Hellenistic style of the riders and the Parthian style of the other characters led to the assumption that the four men on the right side were added later. The rider probably represents a king, and has been identified as Mithridates I, who conquered Elymais in 140/139 BC. Accordingly, the relief is celebrating his victory. This interpretation was originally accepted by many scholars. However, more recently this view has been challenged and other theories have been proposed, including one that the rider is a local ruler of the Elymais. The modern historian Trudy S. Kawami has suggested the figure might be Kamnaskires II Nikephoros, the second ruler of Elymais, who declared independence from the Seleucids.

== Legacy ==

Of all Mithridates&#x27; accomplishments, his greatest one was to transform Parthia from a small kingdom into a major political power in the Ancient East. His conquests in the west seem to have been based on a plan to reach Syria and, thereby, gain Parthian access to the Mediterranean Sea. The modern historian Klaus Schippmann emphasises this, stating &quot;Certainly, the exploits of Mithridates I can no longer simply be classified as a series of raids for the purpose of pillaging and capturing booty.&quot; The Iranologist Homa Katouzian has compared Mithridates I to Cyrus the Great (), the founder of the Achaemenid Empire.

<doc id="344380" wikidata="Q7346574" url="?curid=344380" title="Robert Lee Hill">
<text>Robert Lee Hill (June 8, 1892 – May 11, 1963) was an African-American sharecropper from the Arkansas Delta and a political activist, founder of the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America following World War I. Based in Arkansas, this organization was intended to help sharecroppers and tenant farmers to gain better financial arrangements with white landowners.

Hill was involved in an organizing meeting of black farmers near Elaine, Arkansas on September 30, 1919. When two deputized white men and a black trustee arrived at the church to disrupt the meeting, shots were exchanged. The white community reacted with extreme violence in an event which became known as the Elaine massacre. For two days, white militia swept through the county attacking blacks; a total of five whites and an estimated 100-237 blacks were killed, and the government called in federal troops to quell the riot. Hill fled to Kansas, where he was later arrested. The NAACP worked on his behalf with the state and with federal authorities. Governor Henry Justin Allen refused an extradition request from the state of Arkansas, stating he did not believe Hill would be safe in Arkansas jails or given a fair trial there. Federal charges were later dropped and Hill was released from jail in October 1920.

He later worked for at least two different railroad companies in the Midwest, from 1920 to 1962. Their expansion provided new industrial jobs for African Americans. He died within a year after his retirement in August 1962.

==Early life==
Robert Lee Hill was born in Dermott, Chicot County, Arkansas. There is little documentation of his birth and early life. Documents in his handwriting seem to show that he had some form of limited formal education. Hill did complete a correspondence course as a private investigator and was known to refer to himself as &quot;Robert Hill, U.S. Detective&quot;.

The white Democratic-dominated legislature passed an election law in 1891 and poll tax amendment to the state constitution in 1892 that effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites in the state. With little opposition left, the legislature passed and imposed Jim Crow laws for racial segregation.

Hill was listed as working as a brakeman for the Missouri Pacific Railroad in Little Rock, Arkansas, from January 1915 to December 1919. Sometime before 1918, Hill moved from his birthplace to the town of Winchester, Arkansas, in Drew County. By this time he was married, had two children, and worked for the Valley Planting Company.

==Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America==
While living in Winchester, Hill became active in organizing African-American laborers, sharecroppers and tenant farmers. They worked for white landowners at a disadvantage, as they were dependent on the owners&#x27; dispersing funds and settling accounts after they sold the cotton crops. The landowners seldom provided itemized accounts, often required sharecroppers to buy seeds and supplies from plantation stores, and sold the cotton according to their own schedules. Sharecroppers often struggled financially for months after delivering cotton to the landowners and before receiving any payments.

Hill formed the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America. He based his association on black fraternal organizations, the international trade union movement, and Booker T. Washington&#x27;s National Negro Business League. Hill intended to use the organization to force landowners to pay tenant farmers their full shares and to establish union-owned farms.

During the summer of 1919, following the end of World War I, Hill encouraged hundreds of African-American sharecroppers and sawmill workers to join his organization. Hill was successful in attracting African-American veterans of the war, who resented the racial discrimination they faced at home after their service in the war. During that summer, Hill organized union chapters in the small towns of Hoop Spur, Ratio, Elaine, Old Town, Countiss, Ferguson, and Mellwood.

==Elaine Race Riot==
In the fall, two of the chapters hired lawyers from Little Rock to try and force fair treatment in the courts. Black informants reported this information to local whites, who tried to keep track of local meetings. Gunfire broke out at a September 30 meeting of the Hoop Spur chapter and a white man was killed; hundreds of whites poured into the area, attacking blacks throughout the county during that night and the next days. This was known as the Elaine Race Riot, or Elaine Massacre: a total of five whites and an estimated 100-237 blacks were killed. It was the deadliest race riot in United States history; only blacks were indicted by county officials in these events.

Hill escaped the ensuing chaos and fled to Kansas. He was announced as &quot;the most wanted man in Arkansas,&quot; and authorities portrayed him as the leader of a conspiracy to kill plantation owners.

===Arrest and extradition order===
On 20 January 1920 Hill was arrested in Kansas after Arkansas police determined his location from intercepting a letter that Hill had written to his wife. After his capture, Arkansas officials charged him with murder and asked for his extradition. Federal authorities indicted Hill for inciting to riot and impersonating a federal officer. 

After intense lobbying by the NAACP, Kansas Governor Henry Justin Allen refused to extradite Hill. He said that he did not believe Hill would receive a fair trial in Arkansas, nor would he be safe in Arkansas jails. Hill was released on October 11, 1920, after federal charges were dropped due to NAACP lobbying with authorities in Washington.

==Later years==
Hill suffered an injury while working at a meatpacking plant in Topeka, Kansas in 1921. Unable to carry out heavy physical work, he tried to get a position with the NAACP. James Weldon Johnson, the NAACP executive secretary, recommended that Hill join the Topeka branch.

According to his 1935 railroad service verification records, Hill went to work as a carman helper in the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway shops in Topeka beginning July 1, 1922 under the name George L. Smith. He changed his name back to Robert Lee Hill in February 1924. He worked as a laborer with the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in Chicago from January 1920 to May 1922.

The service record states he was born in Dermott, Drew County (&quot;sic&quot; Chicot County), Arkansas, on June 8, 1892. He retired from his work with the AT&amp;SF Railroad on August 16, 1962. He died May 11, 1963, in Topeka and is buried at the Topeka Cemetery.

<doc id="344385" wikidata="Q6759899" url="?curid=344385" title="Margaret Sinclair (nun)">
<text>Margaret Anne Sinclair, PCC (29 March 1900 – 24 November 1925), religious name Mary Francis of the Five Wounds, was a Scottish Catholic nun of the Colettine Poor Clares. She was declared venerable by Pope Paul VI on 6 February 1978.

==Life==

===Family===
Andrew Sinclair, from Edinburgh, husband to Elizabeth (&#x27;Leebie&#x27;) Kelly, from Dundee, moved to Edinburgh in 1897 from Dundee. They had six children. The eldest male, John, the eldest female, Isabella (Bella). 

Margaret Sinclair was their third child, and second eldest female. Born on 29 March 1900, at nine in the evening, in the two roomed flat beneath the ground floor, at 24 Middle Arthur Place, Edinburgh.

She had three younger siblings: Andrew, the second eldest male; the youngest female Elizabeth (Lizzie); and, finally, Lawrence. Before Lawrence was born, Margaret&#x27;s parents lost two children. First, James, who died aged only one year old; then, Mary, alive for only a matter of days.

===Parents===
Andrew and Elizabeth were married on New Year&#x27;s Day, or the Solemnity of Mary, the Holy Mother of God, in the Church, in 1896. St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Dundee was the venue for the wedding, but Margaret&#x27;s parents left Dundee within a year, so that Andrew returned to Edinburgh with his wife. Elizabeth was Catholic from birth, but Andrew converted so that they could marry.

Andrew had gone to Dundee to search for work, and whilst Elizabeth worked manufacturing jute in a mill from thirteen years of age onward, Andrew became a tanner. On returning to Edinburgh, he found work with the town council as a road-sweeper, rising early and being paid a low wage.

===Church Life===
Margaret Sinclair was baptised at St Patrick&#x27;s Church on 11 April, 1900. On 8 May 1910, she was confirmed in St Patrick&#x27;s Church, Edinburgh and received the Eucharist for the first time.

Both her older brother John and her father served in World War I. Sinclair left school at the age of fourteen and, from 1914 to 1918, worked full-time at Waverley Cabinet Works as an apprentice French polisher, and became an active member of her trade union.

The Scottish economy had been heavily dependent upon the war; a depression followed the end of the Great War. Many activities necessary for the war economy, such as arms production and ship construction, no longer played a major role in the Scottish Economy; the skills required to undertake these tasks were not easily transferable to the civilian economy. Margaret was unemployed, and by 1918 the Waverley Cabinet Works had shut its doors. She would later find work in a biscuit factory run by McVitie.

In 1922, seeking a life of solitude and prayer, Margaret applied to join the Poor Clares in Notting Hill, London.

==Religious life==

On 21 July 1923, Margaret and her brother Andrew travelled to London. The two would say goodbyes; Andrew was emigrating to Canada while Margaret would enter the convent of the Colettine Poor Clares in Notting Hill. Upon entrance to the convent, she took the name &quot;Mary Francis of the Five Wounds&quot; after Mary Frances of the Five Wounds. Many members of the religious community doubted Sinclair&#x27;s ability to live a cloistered life owing to her humble heritage.

Margaret contracted laryngeal tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium run by the Sisters of Charity at Warley, Essex, on 9 April 1925, where she remained until her death on 24 November that same year, and was buried at Kensal Green in north west London. On 22 December 1927 her body was re-interred at Mount Vernon, Liberton, Edinburgh. On 25 October 2003 her remains were again removed and now lie in her home parish church, dedicated to Saint Patrick, in Edinburgh.

The marble slab covering her body has a low relief sculpture of her head in the centre of a cross, but is hard to view unless directly above, as it is white on white.

==Veneration==
Sinclair&#x27;s cause of beatification was introduced to the Sacred Congregation of Rites in 1942 by Pope Pius XII. On 6 February 1978, 100 years after Scotland&#x27;s Roman Catholic hierarchy was restored Margaret Sinclair was declared venerable by Pope Paul VI. The process has continued since then; on 1 June 1982, Pope John Paul II said, &quot;Margaret could well be described as one of God&#x27;s little ones, who through her very simplicity, was touched by God with the strength of real holiness of life, whether as a child, a young woman, an apprentice, a factory worker, a member of a Trade Union or a professed Sister of religion&#x27;&quot;.

St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Old Town, Edinburgh contains the National Shrine of the Venerable Margaret Sinclair.

<doc id="344391" wikidata="Q5686318" url="?curid=344391" title="Hayden Fry">
<text>John Hayden Fry (February 28, 1929 – December 17, 2019) was an American college football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Southern Methodist University (SMU) from 1962 to 1972, North Texas State University—now known as the University of North Texas—from 1973 to 1978, and the University of Iowa from 1979 to 1998, compiling a career coaching record of 232–178–10. Fry played in college at Baylor University. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2003.

==Background==
Born in Eastland, Texas, Hayden Fry was descended from one of the Texas First Families; his great-great-grandfather fought beside General Sam Houston in the Texas War of Independence against Santa Anna in the battle of San Jacinto and in the Mexican War. Fry&#x27;s family moved to Odessa, Texas, when he was in third grade. At age 14, Fry lost his father to a heart attack, and family friends observed that Fry transformed from a shy child to the head of his household. His mother worked at a movie theater, while Fry worked at oil fields during summers.

At Odessa High School, Fry earned all-state honors as quarterback and led the team to the Texas state high school championship in 1946.

Fry then played at Baylor University from 1947 to 1950. Baylor had a 26–13–2 record during Fry&#x27;s four years there. Fry started a few games as an upperclassman at Baylor, but he could never win the full-time starting quarterback job. He graduated from Baylor with a degree in psychology in 1951.

Fry was an American history teacher and assistant football coach at Odessa High School for a year in 1951 before joining the U.S. Marine Corps in 1952. During his time in Odessa, Fry met and befriended a young George H. W. Bush, who would become the 41st President of the United States.

Fry served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1952 to 1955. He played with the Quantico Marines football team in 1953, winning the Marine Corps championship and playing in the Poinsettia Bowl. Fry also coached a six-man football team while in the Marines, and the unique style of play allowed Fry to innovate and invent new creative schemes. He became friends with Al Davis, who was coaching a rival military team; Davis would later become famous as the owner of the Oakland Raiders. Fry&#x27;s time coaching and serving in the Marines were an asset as he began his coaching career. Fry was discharged from the Marines in February 1955 with the rank of captain.

==High school and assistant coach==
In 1955, Hayden returned to Odessa as a teacher and assistant football coach. The following season, Odessa head coach and former Texas A&amp;M freshmen coach Cooper Robbins was promoted to athletic director, and Hayden Fry took his first head coaching job. At 26 years old, he was coaching the high school he had led to the state title less than 10 years earlier.

He served as Odessa&#x27;s head football coach for three years. During that time, he first met and befriended the head coach at Texas A&amp;M, Bear Bryant. Fry also continued as a history teacher at Odessa.

After the 1958 season, the new head football coach at Baylor hired Hayden Fry as an assistant coach. Fry spent two years at Baylor coaching the defensive backs. In 1960, Baylor had an 8–2 record in the regular season and finished the year with a one-point loss to Florida in the 1960 Gator Bowl. That season, Fry&#x27;s defensive secondary helped Baylor lead the nation in pass defense.

Fry left Baylor to become an assistant coach at Arkansas under Frank Broyles. Broyles had been Fry&#x27;s position coach when Fry played at Baylor. Fry was the offensive backfield coach at Arkansas in 1961. Arkansas won the Southwest Conference co-championship with an 8–2 record and narrowly lost the 1962 Sugar Bowl to Bear Bryant&#x27;s Alabama squad. After one year at Arkansas, Southern Methodist University tabbed Fry as their next head football coach for the 1962 season.

==Tenure at SMU and North Texas State==
The SMU Mustangs were members of the Southwest Conference at the time. Fry won the conference coach of the year award in his first season. In 1963, SMU opened the season with a 27–16 loss to a Michigan team coached by Bump Elliott, Fry&#x27;s future boss at Iowa. SMU lost to Oregon in the 1963 Sun Bowl, 21–14. After the season, Fry was also appointed as SMU&#x27;s athletic director.

When Fry took the job at SMU, he was promised that he would be allowed to recruit black athletes. Fry and the school wanted to make certain that the player they recruited was not only a good athlete but also a good student and citizen and someone with the mental toughness to be one of the first black players in conference history. Fry found that player in Jerry LeVias. LeVias was a great player, an exceptional student, and mentally tough. He had never had discipline problems and was deeply religious. LeVias was the perfect player for SMU.

Jerry LeVias had many other scholarship offers to good integrated schools, but he chose to attend SMU. LeVias became the first black player signed to a football scholarship in the Southwest Conference. In 1966, LeVias made his debut, one week after John Hill Westbrook of Baylor became the first black player to play for a conference team. Fry received abuse for recruiting a black player to SMU in the form of hate mail and threatening phone calls, but he downplayed the treatment, because the harassment of LeVias was much, much worse.

SMU had an 8–2 record in 1966 and won its first Southwest Conference title in 18 years. LeVias was named to the all-conference team and handled the racial incidents well. SMU lost in the Cotton Bowl Classic to Georgia but finished the year ranked No. 10 in the nation. SMU had a down year in 1967, but LeVias was again an all-conference selection.

In 1968, SMU went 7–3 and defeated Oklahoma in the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl. LeVias was selected as an all-conference player as a senior for the third time. Fry&#x27;s Mustangs then had just a 12–20 record over the next three years, from 1969 to 1971. That put Fry&#x27;s job in jeopardy, and rumors started to swirl after Fry&#x27;s Mustangs started the 1972 season at 4–4. Not even a three-game winning streak could save Fry. After a 7–4 season in 1972, Fry was fired at SMU, which robbed the Mustangs of a bowl berth.

Hayden Fry compiled a 49–66–1 record in 11 seasons at SMU, including the school&#x27;s only three winning seasons since the late 1940s. In Fry&#x27;s autobiography, Fry stated that he believed his firing was related to several boosters&#x27; desire to start a slush fund to pay players and recruits. SMU was the second-smallest school in the Southwest Conference, and had found it difficult to compete over the last two decades against schools double its size or more. When he refused to go along with the plan, Fry said, the boosters pressured the school&#x27;s new president to fire him. As it turned out, SMU would be hit with NCAA sanctions five times after Fry&#x27;s departure before having its program completely shut down for the 1987 season due to a massive litany of misconduct. Most of the violations were related to the slush fund Fry had opposed several years earlier.

Hayden Fry was hired as the coach and athletic director at North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) before the 1973 season. North Texas appeared to be on the verge of dropping from Division I football or even ending the sport altogether. In 1973, North Texas won a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. However, North Texas left the conference after the year in hopes of joining a more football-oriented conference. While Fry was there, North Texas never did. He also coached three of his sons while at North Texas.

Fry turned North Texas&#x27; program around, compiling a 40–23–3 record over six seasons from 1973 to 1978. In his final four seasons, North Texas had winning records, including a 10–1 mark in 1977 and a 9–2 record in 1978. Still, North Texas never received a bowl invitation. Fry wanted to go to a school where he would be assured of a bowl game with a solid record and where he did not need to also serve as athletic director.

==Iowa coaching career==
Hayden Fry was hired as Iowa&#x27;s 25th head football coach, and fourth in eight seasons, after the 1978 season. Fry had never been to Iowa, but he knew and liked Bump Elliott, by this time the university&#x27;s athletic director. Iowa had had 17 straight non-winning seasons, but Fry was impressed at the fan support for a program that had struggled for so long.

Fry turned his attention to changing a losing attitude and starting new traditions at Iowa. Hayden would not celebrate close losses or moral victories, once even threatening to &quot;punch any player in the mouth if he was smiling&quot; following a 21-6 loss to highly ranked Oklahoma in his first season, a game which Iowa trailed only 7-6 well into the 4th quarter. He hired a marketing group to create the Tigerhawk, a logo to represent the University of Iowa&#x27;s athletic programs. Since both shared the colors of black and gold, Fry gained permission from the Pittsburgh Steelers, the dominant NFL franchise of the time, to overhaul Iowa&#x27;s uniforms in the Steelers&#x27; image. Fry had the team &quot;swarm&quot; onto the field together as they left the locker room, holding hands in a show of solidarity. He also had the visitors&#x27; locker room painted pink. Fry, a psychology major at Baylor, knew that pink is occasionally used in jails and mental institutions to relax and pacify the residents, and Fry claimed that it might have the same effect on the visiting team. Principally, though, Fry hoped that the unusual color would distract and fluster the opposing players and coaches. Visiting head coaches, particularly Bo Schembechler of Michigan, would occasionally try to cover the pink walls with paper to shield their players from the color.

On the field, Fry brought most of his assistant coaches with him from North Texas, including Bill Brashier, his defensive coordinator and a childhood friend from Eastland, Texas, and Bill Snyder, his offensive coordinator. Fry retained some of the Iowa coaches from the previous staff, including Dan McCarney and Bernie Wyatt. Finally, Fry hired the head coach at Mason City High School, Barry Alvarez. Fry would later add Kirk Ferentz as his offensive line coach and hire his former players Bob Stoops, Mike Stoops, Chuck Long, and Bret Bielema as assistant coaches. Fry also gave future South Florida head coach Jim Leavitt one of his first breaks in college football, making him a graduate assistant coach at Iowa in 1989.

===Big Ten title (1979–1981)===
Fry brought a wide-open passing game to the Big Ten for the first time. He had his tight ends stand at the line of scrimmage at the snap, creating a unique looking offensive formation. He tried a number of trick plays, or &quot;exotics&quot;, to keep the opposition on its toes. All this did not immediately translate into wins. After losing seasons in 1979 and 1980, some began to wonder if Fry would suffer the same fate as the four coaches before him, who had left Iowa after failing to produce a winning season.

However, the Hawkeyes broke through in 1981, a magical season for Hawkeye fans. Iowa began the year by upsetting sixth ranked Nebraska, a team that had defeated Iowa 57–0 the previous season. Two weeks later, Iowa defeated sixth ranked UCLA to give Fry his 100th career win. Later that season, Iowa defeated Michigan in Ann Arbor for its first victory over the Wolverines in 19 years. A victory over Purdue in 1981 snapped a 20-game losing streak to the Boilermakers and clinched Iowa&#x27;s first winning season in 19 years, as well as its first bowl appearance in 23 years. Fry had vowed to resign if he didn&#x27;t take Iowa to a bowl game in four years; he had done so in three.

In the final game of the 1981 regular season, Iowa&#x27;s win over Michigan State, coupled with an Ohio State upset of Michigan in Ann Arbor, gave Iowa a share of the 1981 Big Ten title. Since Iowa had last been to the Rose Bowl in 1959, the Hawkeyes got the conference&#x27;s berth in the 1982 Rose Bowl. Either Michigan or Ohio State had gone to the Rose Bowl in each of the previous 13 seasons, prompting critics to nickname the Big Ten the &quot;Big Two and Little Eight&quot;. While the Hawks lost to Washington, they had nonetheless altered the balance of the Big Ten.

===Three more bowls (1982–1984)===
Iowa started the 1982 season with an 0–2 record, but compiled a 6–2 record in the Big Ten to earn a berth in the 1982 Peach Bowl. The Hawkeyes defeated Tennessee to earn Iowa&#x27;s first bowl victory since 1959.

In 1983, Fry&#x27;s Hawkeyes had a 9–2 record overall and a 7–2 mark in the Big Ten as the Hawks earned an invitation to the Gator Bowl. Iowa&#x27;s seven Big Ten wins set a school record, and Iowa&#x27;s nine wins overall tied the school record for wins in a single season set in 1903. Iowa was ranked in the top ten in the country before losing in the Gator Bowl to Florida.

A five-game conference winning streak in 1984 helped put Fry and Iowa in contention for the league title, but injuries contributed to Iowa&#x27;s 0–2–1 finish to the conference schedule. Iowa carried a 7–4–1 record into the 1984 Freedom Bowl against Texas. It was Fry&#x27;s first game against a Texas school since leaving the state in 1978. The Hawkeyes set the stage for the 1985 season by routing Texas, 55–17. It was the most points scored against Texas in eighty years and the second most points ever allowed by the Longhorns.

===Another title and more bowls (1985–1987)===
1985 was arguably Fry&#x27;s best season at Iowa. Iowa was ranked No. 1 in AP poll for the first time in 24 years and remained there for five weeks. During that time, the Hawkeyes scored two thrilling, last-minute victories as America&#x27;s top team. Iowa quarterback Chuck Long scored a last minute touchdown on a bootleg run to clinch a 35–31 victory over Michigan State. Two weeks later, one of the most celebrated games in Iowa history was set to be played.

The Michigan Wolverines came into Iowa City with a perfect 5–0 record and the No. 2 ranking in the AP Poll. It was just the 12th time in college football history that the top two teams in the AP Poll met for a regular season game. It was the first such meeting where the victor scored the winning points on the game&#x27;s final play. With two seconds remaining in the game and Iowa trailing 10–9, kicker Rob Houghtlin booted his fourth field goal of the day, this one from 29 yards out, as time expired to give Iowa a dramatic 12–10 victory over Michigan at Kinnick Stadium.

Iowa would finish the season with a 10–1 record, losing only in Columbus to Ohio State. Still, Iowa would win its first outright Big Ten title in 27 years and secure Fry&#x27;s second Rose Bowl berth and a top ten final ranking. The Hawkeyes set a new school record for wins in 1985, and Long finished second to Bo Jackson for the Heisman Trophy by the narrowest margin in the history of the award. Iowa lost that year&#x27;s Rose Bowl to UCLA, 45-28.

A win in 1986 over Iowa State was Fry&#x27;s 53rd at Iowa, vaulting him past Forest Evashevski to become the winningest coach in Hawkeye history. Iowa had an 8–3 record in 1986 and accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl. The Hawkeyes won the 1986 Holiday Bowl, 39–38, again on a kick by Houghtlin as time expired.

In 1987, the Hawkeyes had a 9–3 record and returned to San Diego for the Holiday Bowl. A second straight Holiday Bowl victory gave Iowa another ten win season. Iowa&#x27;s 62 victories from 1981 to 1987 were the most of any Big Ten team in that span, more than Michigan or Ohio State. Fry had taken a team with 19 consecutive non-winning seasons and turned them into one of the best teams in the Big Ten conference.

===Third Big Ten title (1988–1991)===
The 1988 season marked the 100th season of Iowa football. It was also Fry&#x27;s tenth at the school, making him the first Iowa football coach to lead the Hawkeyes for a full decade. Iowa compiled a 6–3–3 record and accepted its eighth consecutive invitation to a bowl game by playing in the 1988 Peach Bowl.

In 1989, the television show &quot;Coach&quot; debuted, starring Craig T. Nelson as &quot;Hayden Fox&quot;. The title character, created by Iowa alumnus Barry Kemp, was loosely based on Hayden Fry (Fry later appeared in commercials for the NCAA with the female lead of the TV series, Shelley Fabares), and exterior scenes for the show were shot on campus, mainly around Hillcrest Dormitory. Iowa had a disappointing season, however, as a season ending loss to Minnesota cost Iowa a ninth straight bowl game and a Copper Bowl berth, as the Hawkeyes finished the year 5–6.

The Hawks bounced right back in 1990, as Iowa started the season with a 7–1 record. Iowa&#x27;s final regular season game in 1990 was against Minnesota, and Iowa entered the game with records of 8–2 overall and 6–1 in the Big Ten. Early in the game, results of other Big Ten games gave Fry his third conference title and third Rose Bowl berth in ten years more than any other Big Ten Conference team. However, Iowa&#x27;s loss to Minnesota cost the Hawkeyes the outright conference crown; the Hawks finished tied atop the Big Ten Conference standings with Illinois, Michigan, and Michigan State, all of which compiled 6–2 league records. Iowa earned the trip to Pasadena, since the Hawks had beaten all three teams during the regular season, and all of them on the road. Although the Hawkeyes lost in Pasadena for the third time under Fry, many fans expected 1991 to be an even better year.

The Hawks had a better record in 1991, posting a 10–1 record, but the lone loss to Michigan cost Fry a fourth Big Ten title and Rose Bowl berth. Iowa&#x27;s season ending win against Minnesota in 1991 was win number ten on the season, tying the school record for wins in a season. The win over Minnesota was also Fry&#x27;s 100th victory at Iowa. The Hawkeyes accepted a third invitation to the Holiday Bowl, and the 13–13 tie with BYU gave Iowa a 10–1–1 final record and a top ten finish in the final AP rankings.

Iowa&#x27;s winning percentage from 1981 to 1991 ranked second in the Big Ten behind Michigan and ahead of Ohio State. The Hawkeyes played in 10 bowl games in 11 years and won three Big Ten titles during that span.

===Winning two more bowl games (1992–1996)===
As Fry got older and several assistant coaches departed for other coaching jobs, Iowa had a down period from 1992 to 1994. A season ending loss to Minnesota in 1992 gave Fry just his second losing season in the last 12 years, as Iowa finished with a 5–7 record. After starting the 1993 season at 2–5, the Hawkeyes rebounded with four straight wins to garner an Alamo Bowl berth. Iowa&#x27;s final win of the 1993 season over Minnesota gave Fry the 200th victory of his coaching career.

However, Iowa lost the inaugural Alamo Bowl to California, 37–3. The Hawkeyes then struggled to a 5–5–1 record the following year in 1994, and some critics wondered if Fry&#x27;s coaching career was at an end.

But Fry had one last run of winning seasons. In 1995, the Hawkeyes had a 7–4 record and played Pacific-10 Conference co-champion Washington in the Sun Bowl. Fry got a measure of revenge against Washington, who had defeated Iowa in two of their three trips to the Rose Bowl under Fry, by defeating the heavily favored Huskies, 38–18. The Hawks then had an 8–3 record in 1996 and ended the year by recording the first bowl shutout in school history with a 27–0 victory over Texas Tech in the Alamo Bowl.

===Retirement (1997–1998)===
In 1997, the Hawkeyes were expected to again challenge for the Big Ten title. Instead, Wisconsin defeated Iowa for the first time in 20 years. Iowa also led eventual co-national champion Michigan at halftime, 21–7, before falling in Ann Arbor, 28–24. The Hawkeyes ended the disappointing year by losing in the Sun Bowl to Arizona State.

The 1998 season marked Fry&#x27;s 20th and final season at the University of Iowa. It was his worst season at Iowa, as the Hawks finished with a 3–8 record. That season included a 27-9 home loss to intrastate rival Iowa State (Fry&#x27;s first loss to Iowa State in 15 years). Fry, who was secretly undergoing radiation treatments for prostate cancer all year, announced his retirement on November 22, 1998.

In 2002, Fry reportedly expressed an interest in the open head coaching position at his alma mater, Baylor University, that ultimately went to Guy Morriss.

==Legacy and honors==

Fry coached two decades at Iowa, more than twice as long as any coach before him. Fry had a 143–89–6 record at Iowa, giving him the most wins in school history until he was passed by Kirk Ferentz on September 1, 2018. The win came in Ferentz&#x27;s 20th season, as he also tied Fry&#x27;s tenure. He led the Hawkeyes to 14 bowl games; before his arrival they had been to two bowl games in 90 years. He also led the Hawkeyes to three Big Ten titles (one outright, two shared) and three Rose Bowl appearances. Several of Fry&#x27;s former assistants, such as Barry Alvarez at Wisconsin and Bill Snyder at Kansas State, followed Fry&#x27;s example in resurrecting other struggling football programs.

Former Fry assistants or players who have taken over as head coaches at a Division I-A college football programs include:

* Barry Alvarez, Wisconsin, 1990–2005
* Bret Bielema, Wisconsin, 2006–2012; Arkansas, 2013–2017; Illinois 2021-present
* Bob Diaco, Connecticut, 2014–2016
* Kirk Ferentz, Iowa, 1999–present
* Jim Leavitt, South Florida, 1996–2009
* Chuck Long, San Diego State, 2006–2008
* Dan McCarney, Iowa State, 1995–2006; North Texas, 2011–2015
* Jerry Moore, North Texas State, 1979-1980; Texas Tech, 1981-1985; Appalachian State, 1989-2012 
* Jay Norvell: Nevada, 2017–2021, Colorado State, 2022-present
* Bo Pelini, Nebraska, 2008–2014; Youngstown State 2015–2019
* Bob Stoops, Oklahoma, 1999–2016
* Mark Stoops, Kentucky, 2013–present
* Mike Stoops, Arizona, 2004–2011
* Bill Snyder, Kansas State, 1989–2005, 2009–2018

After undergoing successful treatment for prostate cancer, Fry moved to Nevada to live in retirement. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2003, alongside former SMU star Jerry LeVias. He received the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award, presented by the American Football Coaches Association, in 2005.

In 2009, prior to the first football game of the Hawkeyes&#x27; season, First Avenue in adjoining Coralville was co-named Hayden Fry Way in his honor. This road is one of the main routes that can be taken to Kinnick Stadium from Interstate 80.

On December 30, 2010, Fry was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the Pasadena Convention Center. As part of being honored, Fry participated in the 122nd Annual Tournament of Roses Parade and was recognized for his induction at the 2011 Rose Bowl following the third quarter. In the Rose Bowl game during which Fry was honored, his former player Bret Bielema&#x27;s Wisconsin Badgers lost to the TCU Horned Frogs.

In January 2016, it was announced that Coralville&#x27;s City Council was set to vote on an agreement with a company to design and create a life-sized bronze statue to honor Fry. The city hired Max-Cast, a fine arts foundry, to create the $36,000 statue that would be placed along Hayden Fry Way. In May 2016, it was announced that the statue would be unveiled at Fry Fest 2016 on September 2. The following week, the statue was permanently installed at the northwest corner of the First Avenue and Ninth Street intersection in Coralville, and serves as both an entrance to the Iowa River Landing and a foreboding presence to opposing teams visiting Kinnick Stadium.

==Death==
On December 17, 2019, Fry died of cancer at age 90.

==In popular culture==
A television sitcom, &quot;Coach&quot;, aired for nine seasons on ABC from 1989 to 1997. The series starred Craig T. Nelson as Hayden Fox, head football coach of the fictional Minnesota State University Screaming Eagles. The show&#x27;s creator and producer, Barry Kemp, a University of Iowa alumnus, named the main character Hayden Fox as a tribute to Fry.

<text>Jan Koller (; born 30 March 1973) is a Czech former professional footballer who played as a striker. He was noted for his height, strong physique and heading ability.

He began his career at Sparta Prague, then moved to Belgium, where he became the Belgian First Division top scorer with Lokeren. He won the league championship twice with Anderlecht and the Belgian Golden Shoe. In 2001, he joined Borussia Dortmund, where he won the Bundesliga title in his first season and scored 73 goals in 167 official games over five campaigns. He moved frequently in his later career, with stops in France, Germany and Russia.

Koller is the all-time top scorer for the Czech Republic national team, with 55 goals in 91 appearances in a decade-long career starting in 1999. He represented the nation at three UEFA European Championships and the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Koller started his football training as a goalkeeper, but was converted to striker by the time he started his professional career with Czech club Sparta Prague. He made his début for Sparta in the spring of 1995 in a match against Benešov, coming on as a substitute with 20 minutes of the game remaining. In 1996, Koller caught the eye of Belgian football and signed with the club Lokeren for a fee equivalent to €102,000.

===Anderlecht===
After a successful three-year stint, in which he managed to finish as Belgian First Division top-scorer in his last season at Lokeren, Koller was signed by Belgian club Anderlecht. He quickly built up a successful partnership with Canadian striker Tomasz Radzinski, excelling in his debut season and earning him the Belgian Golden Shoe in 2000. At the end of the season, he was bought by German side Borussia Dortmund after turning down English side Fulham.

===Borussia Dortmund===

While Koller was at Dortmund, the club won the 2001–02 Bundesliga, thanks in part to Koller&#x27;s 11 league goals. Besides the Bundesliga title his biggest success whilst at Dortmund was helping them to the 2002 UEFA Cup Final, where his goal could not prevent them losing 3–2 to Feyenoord.

His training as a goalkeeper saw some use in the 2002–03 season. In a Bundesliga match against Bayern Munich, Dortmund&#x27;s goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off in the second half for a second yellow card, and Dortmund had already used their three substitutions. Koller, who had already opened the scoring in the 8th minute, moved from striker to goalkeeper after 67 minutes of the match. He prevented any more goals for the rest of the match, despite Dortmund having been reduced to nine players due to the earlier expulsion of Torsten Frings. Koller was named by &quot;kicker&quot; as the Bundesliga&#x27;s top goalkeeper of the week for his performance.

===Monaco and Nürnberg===
In a surprising move, Koller signed with French side Monaco in 2006 but a two-season disappointing campaign, despite a decent scoring record, forced him to move back to Germany to play with Nürnberg. Unfortunately for Koller, who wasn&#x27;t the only Czech in the team as he was partnered with Tomáš Galásek and Jaromír Blazek, the Nürnberg-based club had performed poorly throughout the season and were relegated to 2. Bundesliga at the end of the 2007–08 season. In 14 matches Bundesliga matches he netted twice for Nürnberg.

===Later career===

On 23 June 2008, Koller was transferred to Russian club Krylia Sovetov Samara in a deal worth €1 million. On 5 December 2009, Koller returned to France, joining Championnat National team Cannes, with a contract until June 2011. Koller announced his retirement from football in August 2011 after a series of injuries.

==International career==

Koller made his debut for the Czech Republic in a friendly away to Belgium at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels on 9 February 1999, and netted the only goal of the game in the 73rd minute.

Koller became the all-time top scorer for the Czech Republic on 8 June 2005 following a match against Macedonia, in which he scored four goals in just 11 minutes of a 6–1 win, taking his international total to 39.

In his third month with Nürnberg, Koller announced that he would retire from the Czech national team after Euro 2008. However, after losing a Euro 2008 Group A match against Turkey 3–2, Koller eventually retired from international football.

In July 2009, Koller announced that he would rejoin the national team because of poor results in the 2010 World Cup qualification. He played in the match against Slovakia, but announced his retirement from international football again on 6 September.

== Style of play ==
Koller was particularly noted for his height, strong physique and heading ability, being referred to as a &quot;towering forward&quot; and a &quot;human lighthouse&quot;. Due to his stature, he was often nicknamed &quot;Dino&quot; throughout his career.

<text>The Oregon University System (OUS) was administered by the Oregon State Board of Higher Education (the &quot;Board&quot;) and the Chancellor of the OUS, who was appointed by the Board. It was disbanded in June 2015.

OUS was responsible for governing the state&#x27;s seven public universities. Legislation passed in 2013 allowed Oregon public universities the option to set up their own institutional governing boards and the state&#x27;s three largest universities (Oregon State University, University of Oregon, Portland State University) opted for institutional boards that became effective July 1, 2014. The four remaining regional universities in the OUS system (Eastern Oregon University, Oregon Institute of Technology, Southern Oregon University, Western Oregon University) later opted for institutional boards, effective July 1, 2015.

Administrative work that was conducted by OUS has been managed since June 2015 by academic and financial units of the Oregon Office of University Coordination and the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission.

<doc id="344399" wikidata="Q292600" url="?curid=344399" title="Chausey">
<text>Chausey () is a group of small islands, islets and rocks off the coast of Normandy, in the English Channel. It lies from Granville and forms a &quot;quartier&quot; of the Granville commune in the Manche &quot;département&quot;. 

Chausey forms part of the Channel Islands from a geographical point of view, but, because it is under French jurisdiction, it is almost never mentioned in the context of the other Channel Islands. There are no scheduled transport links between Chausey and the other Channel Islands, although between two and four daily shuttles link Chausey to mainland France through Granville, depending on the season.

The &quot;-ey&quot; ending of the name Chausey may be assumed to be associated with the Norse &quot;-ey&quot; (meaning &quot;island&quot;), as seen not only in Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, but also islands farther away like Anglesey, Orkney and Heimaey.

==History==
In 933, the Duchy of Normandy annexed the Channel Islands including Chausey, Minquiers and Ecrehous. In 1022, Richard II, Duke of Normandy, gave Chausey and the barony of Saint-Pair-sur-Mer to the Benedictine monks of Mont Saint-Michel, who built a priory on the Grande île.

The islands became subject to the Kingdom of England following the conquest of England by William, Duke of Normandy in 1066. However, in 1202, in a conflict with King John, Philip Augustus of France, claiming feudal overlordship of Normandy, summoned the English King to answer charges or forfeit all lands which he held in fee of the King of France. John refused to appear and, in 1204, Philip occupied continental Normandy, although he failed in his attempts to occupy the islands in the Channel. The 1259 Treaty of Paris confirmed the loss of Normandy but the retention of the &quot;islands (if any) which the King of England should hold&quot; under suzerainty of the King of France. The vassalage requirement was extinguished in the Treaty of Calais of 1360.

Chausey was for a long time an object of rivalry between England and France. Although the UK government has contended that, until about 1764, Chausey belonged to England, Chausey, unlike its Channel Islands neighbours, has, in fact, been French for centuries. It was administered from Jersey until 1499, when the Jerseymen abandoned it to the French for reasons unknown. The Jersey historian Alec Podger has suggested that it was too costly in terms of money and manpower to control and, as the islands were not on the sea-lanes, it was decided that the benefits did not justify this cost. Seafarers engaged in illegal business long valued this maze of islands as a den of piracy and smuggling. The Sound, the natural channel running along the Grande île, or the Passe Beauchamp, were ideally secluded anchorages.

The fortress of Matignon was built in 1559 as a quadrangular fort with a round tower, cellars, a bakery, and a cattle shed. This was expanded in 1740. The English destroyed the fort in 1744. A new fort was built at the other end of the island, which the English destroyed in 1756. In 1772, the Louis XV granted the archipelago to the Abbot Nolin. Napoleon III ordered the construction of the present fort in 1859, and the work was completed by 1866. The fort then served briefly as a prison for Communards in 1871. 

Although the fort ceased to be a military site in 1906, during World War I it held some 300 German and Austrian prisoners of war. The automobile engineer Louis Renault purchased it and restored it between 1922 and 1924, with the result that it became known as Château Renault. He used it as a retreat from business. During World War II German soldiers garrisoned the fort. Today the casemate serves as the home for several fishermen.

==Geography==
Grande-Île, the main island, is long and wide at its widest (approximately ), though this is just the tip of a substantial and complex archipelago which is exposed at low tide. The archipelago comprises 365 islands at low tide, compared to only 52 islands at high tide. 

From a few dozen hectares of ground above the high tide line, the archipelago increases to around at low water, within an area roughly . The tidal range is one of the largest in Europe, with up to difference between low and high tide. The islands consist of a granitic geological formation, which has been subjected to erosion by sea and wind. Sandbars connect several parts of Chausey.

Grand Île is the only inhabited island of the group, with a population of around 30. In summer the population increases, due to the tourism which constitutes an essential activity on the island, with nearly 200,000 annual visitors. Several tourist businesses operate on the island, including a hotel, restaurant and shop. Besides tourism, fishing is the main economic activity. Lobster, shrimp, conger, bass and mullet are caught, while mussels and oysters are farmed. Until 1989, a cattle farm operated on the island. The island&#x27;s granite was formerly quarried, and the stone exported. Chausey stone was used in the construction of Mont Saint-Michel.

The typical boats of Chausey are the &quot;doris&quot; (dory), a flat-bottomed boat traditionally propelled by oars or nowadays an engine, used by the fishermen, and the &quot;canot chausiais&quot;, a small clinker-built sailing boat used for pleasure. Every August, the Chausey Regatta takes place on the first weekend of the neap tide. The festivities last all weekend, during which several boat races are organized.

<doc id="344400" wikidata="Q6107133" url="?curid=344400" title="J. Steven Griles">
<text>James Steven Griles (born December 13, 1947) is an American former government official and lobbyist who served as the 3rd United States Deputy Secretary of the Interior from July 12, 2001 until his resignation on December 7, 2004. Griles held the second-ranking position at the United States Department of the Interior, ranking below only the Secretary of the Interior, at the time Gale Norton.

Griles served as a Department of the Interior representative on Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s energy task force. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to felony obstruction of justice in the Senate investigation of the Abramoff scandal, the highest-ranking Bush administration official to do so. He was sentenced to a fine and 10 months imprisonment.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Clover, Virginia, Griles earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Richmond in 1970.

== Career ==
Griles was formerly a principal with National Environmental Strategies, Inc. (NES), a public affairs firm that provided advice and lobbying services to companies, trade associations and others regarding policy, regulatory, environmental and energy issues at the Federal and State government level. Prior to joining NES, he was Senior Vice President for Public, Environmental and Marketing Activities for the United Company. Located in Bristol, Virginia, the United Company was a diversified natural resources company with select diversification in non-energy areas, with operations in coal, oil and gas, cogeneration, gold mining, manufacturing, real estate, hotels, and golf operations with both domestic and foreign interests.

Griles worked in the Reagan administration as deputy director of the Office of Surface Mining, Department of the Interior from 1981 to 1983, and as assistant secretary and deputy assistant secretary of the Interior for Lands and Minerals Management (1983–1989).

=== Department of Interior ===

Griles was confirmed as Deputy to Interior Secretary Gale Norton. Second in rank only to Norton, Griles effectively was Interior&#x27;s chief operating officer and its top representative on Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s energy task force.

Upon taking the job of Deputy Secretary, Griles was allowed to receive payments totaling more than $1 million from 2001 to 2005 as part of a buyout by NES while collecting his $150,000 annual federal salary. This was allowed only under conditions approved by the Office of Government Ethics and the Senate, and Griles signed a written agreement stating he would recuse himself from &quot;any particular matter involving specific parties in which any of [his] former clients is or represents a party.&quot;

However, a Freedom of Information Act request in September 2002 turned up evidence that Griles had met with former clients in the fossil fuel industries, despite the agreement. Griles resigned after an 18-month investigation by the Department&#x27;s Inspector General concluded that Griles indeed had contact with former NES clients in violation of the agreement, although the report did not accuse Griles of violating any laws or federal ethics rules.

David Hirsch, a director for Friends of the Earth, said of Griles: &quot;he spent four years working for his former clients at the Department of Interior. It didn&#x27;t seem to matter how many problems came out, he just kept going. He&#x27;s the Energizer Bunny of conflict of interest.&quot;

Griles was also asked to testify before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in the 2005 investigation of the Abramoff scandal. Jack Abramoff&#x27;s private emails indicated that Griles had pledged to use his authority to block a casino which Abramoff was lobbying against. Abramoff also indicated that he was interested in hiring Griles.

Furthermore, Griles was involved with donations made to Council of Republicans for Environmental Advocacy, run by his then-girlfriend, Italia Federici. Donations were made to CREA by both Abramoff&#x27;s tribal clients and by energy-sector companies with connections to Griles.

Upon leaving office, Griles joined with two other political veterans, former White House national energy policy director Andrew Lundquist and former House member George Nethercutt, to form the political lobbying firm of Lundquist, Nethercutt &amp; Griles, LLC. In his first two years with the firm, it made $1.3 million in lobbying fees. The following year, it was $1.6 million. Griles remarked, &quot;If you’re honest and represent people fairly, you can succeed.&quot;

On January 10, 2007, the United States Department of Justice notified Griles that charges would be brought against him for making false statements in his 2005 testimony.
On that date Griles resigned from Lundquist, Nethercutt &amp; Griles. He pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges on March 23, 2007. On June 8, 2007, Federici pleaded guilty to tax evasion and obstruction of justice. Griles was sentenced to a $30,000 fine and 10 months imprisonment, with some harsh words from Judge Ellen Huvelle, who doubled his prison sentence, telling the former second-ranking Interior Department official: &quot;Even now, you continue to minimize and try to excuse your conduct.&quot;

<text>Kristine Marie Lilly Heavey (; born July 22, 1971) is an American former professional soccer player. She was a member of the United States women&#x27;s national team for 23 years and is the most-capped football player in the history of the sport (men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s), gaining her 354th and final cap against Mexico in a World Cup qualifier in November 2010. Lilly scored 130 international goals for the US national team, making her the team&#x27;s fourth-highest goal scorer behind Carli Lloyd&#x27;s 134, Mia Hamm&#x27;s 158 goals, and Abby Wambach&#x27;s 184.

==Early life==
Lilly was born in New York City and attended Wilton High School in Wilton, Connecticut. While still attending high school, Lilly became a member of the United States women&#x27;s national team. She was recruited by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

===University of North Carolina===
Lilly competed as a student-athlete, playing for the university&#x27;s North Carolina Tar Heels women&#x27;s soccer team from 1989 to 1992. During her time there, she won the NCAA Women&#x27;s Soccer Championship every year she played. She won the Hermann Trophy as a junior in 1991. As a senior, she won the Honda Sports Award as the nations&#x27;s top soccer player. To honor her time with the school, North Carolina retired her #15 jersey in 1994.

==Club career==

Lilly began her career with Tyresö FF of Sweden in 1994. She spent one season with the club before returning to the United States. On August 20, 1995, Lilly joined Washington Warthogs of the now-defunct Continental Indoor Soccer League. She was the only woman in the all-male professional indoor league, following in the footsteps of Collette Cunningham and Shannon Presley who had played in the league sparingly in 1994.

Lilly joined W-League side Delaware Genies in 1998. With the club, she appeared in four games, scoring five goals and providing two assists.

February 2001 saw the formation of the world&#x27;s first women&#x27;s professional soccer league in which all the players were paid. Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA) had its inaugural season in 2001. Lilly was the team captain and a founding member of Boston Breakers. In her first season with the team, she appeared in all twenty-one matches and played every minute of the season. She led the league in assists with eleven and added an additional three goals. For her performance, she was named First Team All-WUSA. In 2002, she started in a further nineteen games. She increased her point total for the season, scoring eight goals and assisting on thirteen others. She was again named First Team All-WUSA and was a starter on the WUSA North All-Star Team. In 2003 Lilly started all nineteen games in which she played, chipping in three goals and four assists and again being named to First Team All-WUSA, the only player in the history of the league to do so. Following the 2003 season, the WUSA ceased operations.

Following the termination of the league, Lilly followed former Boston Breakers head coach Pia Sundhage to Sweden to play for Damallsvenskan club KIF Örebro DFF in 2005. There she was joined by fellow USWNT teammate Christie Welsh as well as USWNT and Boston Breakers teammate Kate Markgraf.

In late-2006 and early-2007, the formation of a new women&#x27;s league took shape under the name of Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS). On September 16, 2008, Lilly was allocated to Boston Breakers along with USWNT teammates Angela Hucles and Heather Mitts. The inaugural 2009 Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer season saw Lilly appear in all twenty games (playing every minute) and score three goals with three assists.

==International career==

Lilly made her debut for the United States national team in 1987, when she was still attending high school. During her international career, she surpassed the previous women&#x27;s world record of 151 caps, held by Norway&#x27;s Heidi Støre, on May 21, 1998. On January 30, 1999, she surpassed what was then the men&#x27;s record of 164 caps, held by Adnan Al-Talyani of the United Arab Emirates.

Lilly has participated in the 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007 editions of the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. She is a two-time World Cup champion, winning in 1991 and 1999; during extra time of the &#x27;99 Final against China, Lilly, standing on the goal line, blocked a Chinese shot which had passed goalkeeper Briana Scurry - since the tournament took place with the golden goal rule in effect, the game would have been over if China had scored - and in the ensuing shootout, she scored the goal which would give the US the lead. When she played against North Korea on September 11, 2007, in the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, she became the first woman (and only the third player overall) to participate in five different World Cup Finals; by scoring a goal against England on September 22, 2007, she became the oldest woman to score in the World Cup.

Lilly has also competed in the 1996, 2000, and 2004 editions of the Olympic Games. She won a gold medal in 1996 and 2004, and a silver medal in 2000. She missed the 2008 Summer Olympics due to the birth of her child.

Unlike several of her longtime teammates (among them Joy Fawcett, Julie Foudy, and Mia Hamm), she did not retire after the team&#x27;s &quot;farewell tour&quot; which finished on December 8, 2004.

On January 18, 2006, Lilly made her 300th international appearance in a game against Norway. In the same match, she equaled Michelle Akers for second place on the team&#x27;s all-time goal scoring list with 105. Lilly was named as a finalist for the 2006 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Player of the Year. She finished second in the voting to Brazil&#x27;s Marta.

After the birth of her daughter, Lilly returned to the national team in December 2008. Her last match for the national team, representing her record 354th cap, was a World Cup qualifying loss to Mexico (1–2) on November 5, 2010, in which she played for six minutes as a substitute.

==Coaching career==
Lilly has been an assistant coach for the Boston Breakers since 2012.

==Personal life==
Lilly grew up in Wilton, Connecticut, and lives in Medfield, Massachusetts. She is married to Brookline firefighter David Heavey, a former hockey player and golfer at the University of Connecticut. Lilly gave birth to her first daughter Sidney Marie Heavey on her birthday, July 22, 2008, and her second daughter Jordan Mary Heavey on September 2, 2011.

She appeared in the HBO documentary &quot;Dare to Dream: The Story of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Soccer Team&quot;. Lilly helps run a soccer camp with Mia Hamm and Tisha Venturini-Hoch.

<text>In religious studies, an ethnic religion or ethnoreligion is a religion or belief associated with notions of heredity and a particular ethnicity. Ethnic religions are often distinguished from universal religions, such as Christianity or Islam, which are not limited in ethnic, national or racial scope.

==Terminology==
A number of alternative terms have been used instead of &quot;ethnic religion&quot;. Another term that is often used is &quot;folk religion&quot;. While &quot;ethnic religion&quot; and &quot;folk religion&quot; have overlapping uses, the latter term implies &quot;the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level.&quot; The term &quot;folk religion&quot; can therefore be used to speak of certain Chinese and African religions, but can also refer to popular expressions of more multi-national and institutionalized religions such as Folk Christianity or Folk Islam.

In Western contexts, a variety of terms are also employed. In the United States and Canada, a popular alternative term has been &quot;nature religion&quot;. Some neopagan movements, especially in Europe, have adopted &quot;ethnic religion&quot; as their preferred term, aligning themselves with ethnology. This notably includes the European Congress of Ethnic Religions, which chose its name after a day-long discussion in 1998, where the majority of the participants expressed that &quot;pagan&quot; contained too many negative connotations and &quot;ethnic&quot; better described the root of their traditions in particular nations. In the English-language popular and scholarly discourse &quot;Paganism&quot;, with a capital P, has become an accepted term.

==Usage==
Ethnic religions are defined as religions which are related to a particular ethnic group, and often seen as a defining part of that ethnicity&#x27;s culture, language, and customs. Diasporic groups often maintain ethnic religions as a means of maintaining a distinct ethnic identity such as the role of African traditional religion and African diaspora religions among the African diaspora in the Americas.

Some ancient ethnic religions, such as those historically found in pre-modern Europe, have found new vitality in neopaganism. Moreover, non-ethnic religions, such as Christianity, have been known to assume ethnic traits to an extent that they serve a role as an important ethnic identity marker, a notable example of this is the Serbian &quot;Saint-Savianism&quot; of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and the religious and cultural heritage of Syriac Christianity branch of the Assyrian people.

<doc id="344409" wikidata="Q594805" url="?curid=344409" title="Jochebed">
<text>According to the Bible, Jochebed (; ) was a daughter of Levi and mother of Miriam, Aaron and Moses. She was the wife of Amram, as well as his aunt. No details are given concerning her life. According to Jewish legend, she is buried in the Tomb of the Matriarchs, in Tiberias. In the New Testament, she is praised for her faith in God.

==Birth of Moses==
The story of Jochebed is thought to be described in the Book of Exodus (2:1–10) – although she is not explicitly named here. (Her name is first mentioned in Exodus 6:20.) She lived in Egypt, where the descendants of Israel were being oppressed. The Pharaoh had decreed that all their baby boys were to be thrown into the Nile, because he feared that they might become too powerful. When Moses, her youngest child, was born, Jochebed hid him for three months until she could hide him no longer. To save her son&#x27;s life, she waterproofed a basket and put the child in it. Jochebed placed Moses in a basket and released him in the flow of River Nile. The basket fell in the hands of the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter who was bathing in the river. Moved with compassion when she discovered the child, she decided to adopt him. The &quot;sister&quot; of the child (presumed to be Miriam), who had come forward, suggested finding her a Hebrew woman to nurse the child. The Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter agreed and so Miriam called her mother, who was appointed to take care of him. Thus Jochebed nursed her son until he was old enough and brought him to the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, who adopted him as her son. The story continues with Moses, who grew up to become the leader of the Exodus, leading his people out of the land of Egypt.

==Relation to Amram==
According to the Book of Numbers, Jochebed was born to Levi when he lived in Egypt. Amram was the son of Kohath, who was a son of Levi. This would make Jochebed the aunt of Amram, her husband. This kind of marriage between relatives was later forbidden by the law of Moses. Jochebed is also called Amram&#x27;s father&#x27;s sister in the Masoretic text of Exodus 6:20, but ancient translations differ in this. Some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the Septuagint state that Jochebed was Amram&#x27;s father&#x27;s cousin, and others state that she was Amram&#x27;s cousin. In the Apocryphal &quot;Testament of Levi&quot;, it is stated that Jochebed was born, as a daughter of Levi, when Levi was 64 years old.

== In Jewish rabbinic literature ==

Jochebed is identified by some rabbis in the Talmud with Shiphrah, one of the midwives described by the book of Exodus as being ordered by Pharaoh to kill the new-born male children. In making this identification, the rabbis interpret the &quot;houses&quot;, with which the Book of Exodus describes God as having compensated the midwives, as having been those of priesthood and of royalty; these &quot;houses&quot; are interpreted by the Talmudic rabbis as allegorical references to Jochebed&#x27;s sonsMoses and Aaron respectively. 

The Exodus Rabbah argues that when the Pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the Nile, Amram divorced Jochebed, who was three months pregnant with Moses at the time, but Miriam soon persuaded him to marry Jochebed again; it goes on to argue that the Egyptians estimated the date that Moses would be due to be born by counting nine months from the start of this marriage, hence allowing Jochebed to hide him for the three months that were overestimated. The Targum Pseudo-Jonathan identifies Jochebed as also having been wife of Elitzaphon Ben Parnach, and the mother of Eldad and Medad; the text is ambiguous as to when this marriage occurred in relation to the marriage(s) to Amram.

Jochebed&#x27;s name is given various allegorical interpretations; the Leviticus Rabbah identifies her as the person named in the Book of Chronicles as &quot;Jehudijah&quot;, by arguing that the name should be interpreted as meaning &quot;the Jewess&quot;, in reference to her founding the Jewish nation by disobeying the Pharaoh&#x27;s order to dispose of the firstborn males.

Some rabbinic literature attempts to resolve the textual discrepancy in which the Torah lists 34 children of Leah born in Mesopotamia, stating that two were dead, and then immediately states that there were 33 in total, by arguing that the figure referred only to the surviving children, and that Jochebed was the 33rd; however, since the Book of Numbers describes Jochebed&#x27;s birth as occurring in Egypt, this necessitated the further rabbinic argument that Jochebed was born exactly on the border of Egypt, in the &quot;gateway of the city&quot;. Biblical scholars have instead simply proposed that the discrepancy in the enumeration of Leah&#x27;s children is due to the list not originally having included Dinah, who was added by a later editor to introduce consistency with the story of the Rape of Dinah.

According to traditional rabbinic biblical chronology, Moses was 80 years old when the Exodus occurred, the Israelites had been in Egypt for 210 years in total, and thus in combination with the rabbinical claim that Jochebed was born on the border of Egypt, as her parents had entered it, this would require Jochebed to have been 130 years old when she gave birth to Moses; Rabbinical literature regards this to have been alluded to be the biblical description of the dedication of the Israelite altar, at which 130 shekel weight of silver was offered.

According to Josephus Flavius the birth of Moses was an extraordinary event because Jochebed was spared the pain of child-bearing due to both her and Amram&#x27;s piety. The Haggadah extends this miraculous nature to Moses&#x27; conception by marking as 130 the age of Jochebed at conception. Several rabbinic commentaries attest to this and comment that maidenhood was restored to Jochebed at the time of her marriage to Amram. The restoration of maidenhood also included the resumption of her fertility.

==Textual criticism==
Textual scholars attribute the genealogy to the Book of Generations, a hypothetical document originating from a similar group and date to the priestly source. According to some Biblical scholars, the Torah&#x27;s genealogy for Levi&#x27;s descendants is actually an aetiological myth reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the Levites – the Gershonites, Kohathites, Merarites, and Aaronids; Aaron – the eponymous ancestor of the Aaronids – couldn&#x27;t be portrayed as a brother to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, as the narrative about the birth of Moses (brother of Aaron), which textual scholars attribute to the earlier Elohist source, mentions only that &quot;both&quot; his parents were Levites (without identifying their names). Some Biblical scholars suspect that the Elohist account offers both matrilinial and patrilinial descent from Levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of Moses.

It has been proposed by a number of Biblical scholars that &quot;Ichabod&quot; and &quot;Jacob&quot; may ultimately be linguistic corruptions of &quot;Jochebed&quot;, and possibly once have referred to the same individual.

==Family tree==
According to the masoretic text, Jochebed&#x27;s family tree is as follows:





According to the Septuagint however, Jochebed would be a cousin of Amram or Kohath:






==Islamic view==

Along with the parting of the Red Sea, the burning bush and the Ten Commandments, the Quran relates the story of Moses with some added details and slight differences. His mother, Jochebed (), and her efforts to save the baby Moses are recounted. 

Stories of unusual events during the pregnancy of Aminah, mother of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, are compared with the similar experiences of Jochebed when she was carrying Moses. The significance of this comparison is understood to spring from the affinity of Arabic folklore for Hebrew traditions.

==In popular culture==
The film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; calls her &quot;Yoshebel&quot;. She was portrayed by Martha Scott.

She appears briefly in &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; under the name &#x27;Yocheved&#x27;, voiced by (and resembling) Israeli vocalist Ofra Haza. In the film, she sings a lullaby to baby Moses as she sets the basket carrying him adrift in the river, also pleading the river to deliver Moses &quot;somewhere he can live free&quot;. Ofra sang the lullaby in 18 languages for the film&#x27;s dubbing (including her native Hebrew). In the 2020 West End adaptation of the film, Yocheved was portrayed by Swedish actress and singer Mercedesz Csampai.

In 2014 film &quot;&quot;, she was portrayed by British Actress Anna Savva. She was only shown onscreen at the time that Moses was exiled and got to meet his biological mother.

<text>The World Solar Challenge (WSC), since 2013 named Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, is an international event for solar powered cars driving 3000 kilometres through the Australian outback. 

With the exception of a four-year gap between the 2019 and 2023 events, owing to the cancellation of the 2021 event, the World Solar Challenge is typically held every two years. The course is over through the Australian Outback, from Darwin, Northern Territory, to Adelaide, South Australia. The event was created to foster the development of solar-powered vehicles.

The WSC attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations, although some are fielded by high schools. It has a 32-year history spanning fifteen events, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Initially held once every three years, the event became biennial from the turn of the century.

Since 2001 the WSC was won seven times out of ten efforts by the Nuna team and cars of the Delft University of Technology from the Netherlands. The Tokai Challenger, built by the Tokai University of Japan, was able to win 2009 and 2011. In the most recent editions (2019 &amp; 2023), the Belgian Innoptus Solar Team formerly known as the Agoria Solar Team from KU Leuven University won.

Starting in 2007, the WSC has multiple classes. After the German team of Bochum University of Applied Sciences competed with a four-wheeled, multi-seat car, the &quot;BoCruiser&quot; (in 2009), in 2013 a radically new &quot;Cruiser Class&quot; was introduced, stimulating the technological development of practically usable, and ideally road-legal, multi-seater solar vehicles. Since its inception, Solar Team Eindhoven&#x27;s four- and five-seat &quot;Stella&quot; solar cars from Eindhoven University of Technology (Netherlands) won the Cruiser Class in all four events so far.

Remarkable technological progress has been achieved since the General Motors led, highly experimental, single-seat &quot;Sunraycer&quot; prototype first won the WSC with an average speed of . Once competing cars became steadily more capable to match or exceed legal maximum speeds on the Australian highway, the challenge rules were consistently made more demanding and challenging — for instance after Honda&#x27;s &quot;Dream&quot; car first won with an average speed exceeding in 1996. In 2005 the Dutch Nuna team were the first to beat an average speed of .

The 2017 Cruiser class winner, the five-seat &quot;Stella Vie&quot; vehicle, was able to carry an average of 3.4 occupants at an average speed of . Like its two predecessors, the vehicle was successfully road registered by the Dutch team, further emphasizing the great progress in real-world compliance and practicality that has been achieved.

The WSC held its 30th anniversary event on 8–15 October 2017.

== Objective ==
The objective of the challenge is to promote the innovation of solar-powered cars. It is a design competition at its core, and every team/car that successfully crosses the finish line is considered successful. Teams from universities and enterprises participate. In 2015, 43 teams from 23 countries competed in the challenge.

== Challenge strategy ==

Efficient balancing of power resources and power consumption is the key to success during the challenge. At any moment in time, the optimal driving speed depends on the weather forecast and the remaining capacity of the batteries. The team members in the escort cars will continuously remotely retrieve data from the solar car about its condition and use these data as input for prior developed computer programs to work out the best driving strategy.

It is equally important to charge the batteries as much as possible in periods of daylight when the car is not driving. To capture as much solar energy as possible, the solar panels are generally directed such that these are perpendicular to the incident sun rays. Sometimes the whole solar array is tilted for this purpose.

== Important rules ==
*The timed portion of the challenge stops at the outskirts of Adelaide, 2998 km from Darwin. However, for the timings recorded at that point to count, competitors must reach the official finish line in the centre of the city under solar power alone.
*As the challenge utilises public roads, the cars have to adhere to the normal traffic regulations.
*A minimum of 2 and maximum 4 drivers have to be registered. If the weight of a driver (including clothes) is less than , ballast will be added to make up the difference.
*Driving time is between 8:00 and 17:00 (from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.). In order to select a suitable place for the overnight stop (alongside the highway) it is possible to extend the driving period for a maximum of 10 minutes, which extra driving time will be compensated by a starting time delay the next day.
*At various points along the route there are checkpoints where every car has to pause for 30 minutes. Only limited maintenance tasks (no repairs) are allowed during these compulsory stops.
*The capacity of the batteries is limited to a mass for each chemistry (such as Lithium Ion) equivalent to approximately 5 kWh maximum. At the start of the route, the batteries may be fully charged. Batteries may not be replaced during the competition, except in the situation of a breakdown. However, in that case, a penalty time will apply.
*Except for the maximum outer dimensions, there are no further restrictions on the design and construction of the car.
*The deceleration of the dual braking system must be at least 3.8 m/s2 (149.6 in/s2).

=== Rule evolution ===
*By 2005, several teams were handicapped by the South Australian speed limit of , as well as the difficulties of support crews keeping up with solar vehicles. It was generally agreed that the challenge of building a solar vehicle capable of crossing Australia at vehicular speeds had been met and exceeded. A new challenge was set: to build a new generation of solar car, which, with little modification, could be the basis for a practical proposition for sustainable transport.
*Entrants to the 2007 event chose between racing in the Adventure and Challenge classes. Challenge class cars were restricted to 6 square meters of Si solar collectors (a 25% reduction), and later to 3 square meters for GaAs, driver access and egress were required to be unaided, seating position upright, steering controlled with a steering wheel, and many new safety requirements were added. Competitors also had to adhere to the new speed limit across the Northern Territory portion of the Stuart Highway. The 2007 event again featured a range of supplementary classes, including the Greenfleet class, which features a range of non-solar energy-efficient vehicles exhibiting their fuel efficiency.
*For the 2009 challenge class several new rules were adopted, including the use of profiled tyres. Battery weight limits depend on secondary cell chemistries so that competitors have similar energy storage capabilities. Battery mass is now 20 kg for Li-ion and Li-polymer battery (was reduced from 25 and 21 kg in the past).
*In 2013, a new Cruiser Class was introduced. The route took place in four stages. Final placings were based on a combination of time taken (56.6%), number of passengers carried (5.7%), battery energy from the grid between stages (18.9%), and a subjective assessment of practicality (18.9%)
*In the 2015 Cruiser Class regulations, the scoring formula emphasized practicality less than before. Elapsed time will account for 70% of the score, passengers 5%, grid energy use 15%, and practicality 10%.
*In 2017, solar array areas were reduced, and the Cruiser Class was changed to a Regularity Trial, with scoring based on energy efficiency and practicality.

== History ==
The idea for the competition originates from Danish-born adventurer Hans Tholstrup. He was the first to circumnavigate the Australian continent in a open boat. At a later stage in his life he became involved in various competitions with fuel-saving cars and trucks. Already in the 1980s, he became aware of the necessity to explore sustainable energy as a replacement for the limited available fossil fuel. Sponsored by BP, he designed the world&#x27;s first solar car, called The Quiet Achiever, and traversed the between Sydney, New South Wales and Perth, Western Australia in 20 days. That was the precursor of the WSC.

After the 4th event, he sold the rights to the state of South Australia and leadership of the event was assumed by Chris Selwood.

The event was held every three years until 1999 when it was switched to every two years.

=== 1987 ===
The first edition of the World Solar Challenge was run in 1987 when the winning entry, GM&#x27;s Sunraycer won with an average speed of . Ford Australia&#x27;s &quot;Sunchaser&quot; came in second. The &quot;Solar Resource&quot;, which came in 7th overall, was first in the Private Entry category.

=== 1990 ===
The 1990 WSC was won by the &quot;Spirit of Biel&quot;, built by Biel School of Engineering and Architecture in Switzerland followed by Honda in second place. Video coverage here.

=== 1993 ===
The 1993 WSC was won by the Honda &quot;Dream&quot;, and Biel School of Engineering and Architecture took second. Video coverage here.

=== 1996 ===
In the 1996 WSC, the Honda &quot;Dream&quot; and Biel School of Engineering and Architecture once again placed first and second overall, respectively.

=== 1999 ===

The 1999 WSC was finally won by a &quot;home&quot; team, the Australian Aurora team&#x27;s &quot;Aurora 101&quot; took the prize while Queen&#x27;s University was the runner-up in the most closely contested WSC so far. The SunRayce class of American teams was won by Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

=== 2001 ===

The 2001 WSC was won by Nuna of the Delft University of Technology from the Netherlands, participating for the first time. Aurora took second place.

=== 2003 ===

In the 2003 WSC &quot;Nuna 2&quot;, the successor to the winner of 2001 won again, with an average speed of , while Aurora took second place again.

=== 2005 ===

In the 2005 WSC the top finishers were the same for the third consecutive event as Nuon&#x27;s &quot;Nuna 3&quot; won with a record average speed of , and Aurora was the runner-up.

=== 2007 ===

The 2007 WSC saw the Dutch Nuon Solar team score their fourth successive victory with &quot;Nuna 4&quot; in the Challenge Class, averaging under the new, more restrictive rules, while the Belgian Punch Powertrain Solar Team&#x27;s &quot;Umicar Infinity&quot; placed second.

The Adventure Class was added this year, run under the old rules, and won by Japanese Ashiya team&#x27;s &quot;Tiga&quot;.

The Japanese Ashiya team&#x27;s &quot;Tiga&quot; won the Adventure Class, run under the old rules, with an average speed of .

=== 2009 ===
The 2009 WSC was won by the &quot;Tokai Challenger&quot;, built by the Tokai University Solar Car Team in Japan with an average speed of . The longtime reigning champion Nuon Solar Team&#x27;s &quot;Nuna 5&quot; finished in second place.

The Sunswift IV built by students at the University of New South Wales, Australia was the winner of the Silicon-based Solar Cell Class, while Japan&#x27;s Osaka Sangyo University&#x27;s &quot;OSU Model S&quot; won the Adventure class.

=== 2011 ===

In the 2011 WSC Tokai University took their second title with an updated &quot;Tokai Challenger&quot; averaging , and finishing just an hour before &quot;Nuna 6&quot; of the Delft University of Technology. The challenge was marred by delays caused by wildfires.

=== 2013 ===
The 2013 WSC featured the introduction of the Cruiser Class, which comprised more &#x27;practical&#x27; solar cars with 2–4 occupants. The inaugural winner was Solar Team Eindhoven&#x27;s &quot;Stella&quot; from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands with an average speed of , while second place was taken by the PowerCore SunCruiser vehicle from team Hochschule Bochum in Germany, who inspired the creation of the Cruiser Class by racing more practical solar cars in previous WSC events. The Australian team, the University of New South Wales solar racing team Sunswift was the fastest competitor to complete the route, but was awarded third place overall after points were awarded for &#x27;practicality&#x27; and for carrying passengers.


In the Challenger Class, the Dutch team from Delft University of Technology took back the title with &quot;Nuna 7&quot; and an average speed of , while defending champions Tokai University finished second after an exciting close competition, which saw a 10–30 minute distance, though they drained the battery in final stint due to bad weather and finished some 3 hours later; an opposite situation of the previous challenge in 2011.

The Adventure Class was won by Aurora&#x27;s &quot;Aurora Evolution&quot;.

=== 2015 ===

The 2015 WSC was held on 15–25 October with the same classes as the 2013 challenge.
In the Cruiser Class, the winner was once again Solar Team Eindhoven&#x27;s &quot;Stella Lux&quot; from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands with an average speed of , while the second place team was Kogakuin University from Japan who was the first to cross the finish line, but did not receive as many points for passenger-kilometers and practicality. Bochum took 3rd place this year with the latest in their series of cruiser cars.

In the Challenger Class, the team from Delft University of Technology retained the title with &quot;Nuna 8&quot; and an average speed of , while their Dutch counterparts, the University of Twente, who led most of the challenge, finished just 8 minutes behind them in second place, making 2015 the closest finish in WSC history. Tokai University passed the University of Michigan on the last day of the event to take home the bronze.

The Adventure Class was won by the Houston High School solar car team from Houston, Mississippi, United States.

=== 2017 ===
The 2017 WSC was held on 8–15 October, featuring the same classes as 2015. The Dutch NUON team won again in the Challenger class, which concluded on 2017-10-12, and in the Cruiser Class, the winner was once again Solar Team Eindhoven, from the Netherlands as well.



=== 2019 ===
The 2019 WSC was held from 13 to 20 October. 53 teams from 24 countries entered the competition, featuring the same three classes, Challenger (30 teams), Cruiser (23 teams) and Adventure. In the Challenger class, Agoria Solar Team (formerly Punch Powertrain) won for the first time. Tokai University Solar Car Team finished in second place.

In the Cruiser class, Solar Team Eindhoven won their fourth consecutive title. Despite multiple incidents on the road, Team Sonnenwagen Aachen managed to beat other teams and finished in 6th position.

Several teams had mishaps. Vattenfall was leading when their car &quot;Nuna X&quot; caught fire. The driver was uninjured, but the vehicle was destroyed. It was the first no-finish for that team in 20 years. Others were badly affected by strong winds. 

Dutch team Twente was leading the journey at , when their car was forced off the road by winds and rolled over. The driver was taken to hospital. Within 30 minutes team Sonnenwagen Aachen was also blown off the road north of Coober Pedy, the driver was not hurt. An speed limit was then imposed by event officials, lifted when conditions improved. The day before, wind damage to solar panels put the team from Western Sydney University out of the challenge. The driver of &quot;Agoria&quot; from Belgium escaped injury when their vehicle was &quot;uprooted&quot; at 100 km/h (62 mph) by severe winds, but still went on to win the Challenger class.



=== 2021 ===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia the WSC closed entries three months earlier than normal, on 18 December 2020. They were then to &quot;… review all current government measures relating to social distancing, density and contact tracing, international travel restrictions and isolation requirements.&quot; On 12 February 2021, the South Australian Government confirmed the cancellation of the 2021 staging of the event. While the COVID-19 pandemic was not explicitly cited as the reason, the &quot;complexities of international border closures&quot; affecting Australia at the time appear to be the primary reason for the event&#x27;s cancellation. The same statement also noted the next event would take place in October 2023 - at least 962 days from the date of announcement, and resulting in a four-year gap between events. Registered teams should receive a full refund of all fees.

=== 2023 ===
The 2023 World Solar Challenge was held from October 22-29. At the beginning of the race, 31 teams were participating, with 23 in the Challenger division and 8 in the Cruiser division. The Challenger division was won by defending champions Innoptus (formerly Agoria) with an average speed of 88.2km/h, and the Cruiser division was won by UNSW Sunswift with a score of 91.1. Uniquely, no Cruisers were able to finish the race this year.

Many of the leading teams faced trouble during the competition. Dutch team Top Dutch raced on a perovskite-tandem solar array damaged from testing in the month leading up to race. Michigan experienced electrical issues during qualifying and had to start last. German team Sonnenwagen was blown off the road just outside of Port Agusta and had to withdraw due to new regulations. Tokai had to stop for several hours on Day 4 to repair their car after sustaining damage from crossing a cattle grid. Kogakuin had consistent problems with their MPPT charge controller, and reported in an Instagram post that their panels were generating less than half the power than they should have been. On the fifth day of the competition, only 4 teams (Innoptus, Twente, Brunel, and Michigan) had finished the course, and by the official end of timing, only 12 teams made it to the finish line successfully.

<text>Marquess of Rockingham, in the County of Northampton, was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1746 for Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Earl of Malton. The Watson family descended from Lewis Watson, Member of Parliament for Lincoln. He was created a Baronet, of Rockingham Castle in the County of Northampton, in the Baronetage of England in 1621. In 1645 he was further honoured when he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Rockingham. The third Baron served as Lord-Lieutenant of Kent. In 1714 he was created Baron Throwley, Viscount Sondes and Earl of Rockingham in the Peerage of Great Britain. His eldest son Edward Watson, Viscount Sondes, predeceased him and he was succeeded by his grandson, the second Earl (the eldest son of Lord Sondes). The second Earl was Lord-Lieutenant of Kent before his early death in 1745. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, Thomas. He had previously represented Canterbury in Parliament.

He was succeeded in the baronetcy and barony of Rockingham by his first cousin once removed, Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Earl of Malton, who became the sixth Baron. He was the son of the Honourable Thomas Watson-Wentworth, third son of the second Baron. He had adopted the additional surname Wentworth when he inherited the estate of his maternal uncle, William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford, in 1695. In 1728 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Malton. In 1733 he was made Baron Harrowden, Baron Wath, Viscount Higham and Earl of Malton in the Peerage of Great Britain. In April 1746, two months after succeeding in the barony of Rockingham, he was created Marquess of Rockingham, in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the second Marquess. In September 1750, two months before succeeding his father, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland in his own right as Baron Malton and Earl Malton. Lord Rockingham was a prominent Whig grandee and served as Prime Minister of Great Britain between 1765 and 1766 and again in 1782. When he died in 1782 all of his titles became extinct. His estates passed to his nephew, William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam.

The family seats were Rockingham Castle, Northamptonshire, and Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, Yorkshire.

<doc id="344423" wikidata="Q1124778" url="?curid=344423" title="Jewish symbolism">
<text>The Hebrew word for &#x27;symbol&#x27; is , which, in early Judaism, denoted not only a sign, but also a visible religious token of the relation between God and human.

==Common iconography==
==Shabbat==

Shabbat, the day of rest, is described in the Tanakh as God&#x27;s sign (&quot;ot&quot;) between Him and the Jewish people.

==The priests==
The Torah provides detailed instructions () for the garments worn by the priests in the Temple. These details became the subject of later symbolic interpretations.

According to Philo: The priest&#x27;s upper garment symbolized the ether, the blossoms represented the earth, the pomegranates typified running water, and the bells denoted the music of the water. The ephod corresponded to heaven, and the stones on both shoulders to the two hemispheres, one above and the other below the earth. The six names on each of the stones were the six signs of the zodiac, which were denoted also by the twelve names on the breastplate. The miter was the sign of the crown, which exalted the high priest above all earthly kings.

Josephus interpreted as follows: The coat symbolized of the earth, the upper garment symbolized heaven, while the bells and pomegranates represented thunder and lightning. The ephod typified the four elements, and the interwoven gold denoted the glory of God. The breastplate was in the center of the ephod, as the earth formed the center of the universe; the girdle symbolized the ocean, the stones on the shoulders the sun and moon, and the jewels in the breastplate the twelve signs of the zodiac, while the miter was a token of heaven.

The Jerusalem Talmud and Midrash described each garment as providing atonement for a specific sin: the coat for murder or for shatnez, the undergarment for unchastity, the miter for pride, the belt for theft or trickery, the breastplate for any perversion of the Law, the ephod for idolatry, and the robe for slander.

==The symbolic values of numbers==
Various numbers play a significant role in Jewish texts or practice. Some such numbers were used as mnemonics to help remember concepts, while other numbers were considered to have intrinsic significance or allusive meaning. Numbers such as 7, 10, 12, and 40 were known for recurring in symbolic contexts.

Gematria is form of cipher used to generate a numerical equivalent for a Hebrew word, which sometimes is invested with symbolic meaning. For example, the gematria of &quot;chai&quot; (the Hebrew word for life) is 18, and multiples of 18 are considered good luck and are often used in gift giving.

==Metals and minerals==

Gold was a highly regarded precious metal (as in other cultures), but was occasionally avoided due to its association with the sin of the golden calf. Silver was associated with moral purity, as silver metal must be refined from its ore. Brass symbolized hardness, strength, and firmness. Brass was a substitute for gold, and iron for silver.

Salt was offered with every sacrifice; the preservative effect of salt symbolized the eternity of the covenant between God and Israel. In the Talmud salt symbolizes the Torah, for just as &quot;the world cannot exist without salt&quot;, so it can not endure without the Torah.

The priestly breastplate, worn by the Kohen Gadol in the Temple in Jerusalem, had twelve stones representing the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The breastplate, or the stones on their own, are sometimes used as symbols.

==Colors==

In the Torah, the Israelites are commanded to dye one of the threads of their tzitzit (ritual fringes) with a blue-colored dye called &quot;tekhelet&quot;. This dye was highly regarded in both Jewish and non-Jewish cultures of this time, and was worn by royalty and the upper-class. In the Torah, it also appears extensively in ritual contexts such as priestly garments and the curtains of the Tabernacle. Symbolically, in Jewish thought the color of &quot;tekhelet&quot; corresponds to the color of the heavens and the divine revelation. The blue color of &quot;tekhelet&quot; was later used on the tallit, which typically has blue stripes on a white garment. From the 19th century at the latest, the combination of blue and white symbolized the Jewish people, and this combination was chosen for the Flag of Israel.

&quot;Argaman&quot; (Tyrian purple) was another luxurious ancient dye, and was symbolic of royal power.

Tola&#x27;at shani (&quot;scarlet&quot;) was considered a striking and lively color, and was used in priestly garments and other ritual items, but could also symbolize sin.

White (as in linen or wool garments) symbolized moral purity.

Yellow has an association with an anti-Semitic forced identification mark (see Yellow badge).

==Holidays==

The Torah delineates three pilgrimage festivals: Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. Each of these is tied to the agricultural cycle of the Israelites, and also has a theological symbolism.

Passover celebrated the rebirth of nature, and symbolized the origin of the Jewish people. The eating of bitter herbs symbolized the miseries of the Egyptian bondage. In the evenings four cups of wine were drunk, to symbolize the four world-kingdoms. People eating during the Passover meal reclined, in the style of free rich aristocrats, to represent their liberation from slavery.

==Symbolic visions of the Prophets==
Jeremiah beheld an almond-tree as a token of the speedy fulfillment of the word of God. Amos saw a basket of summer fruit as a symbol of the approaching end of Israel.

Ahijah the Shilonite tore Jeroboam&#x27;s mantle into twelve pieces, to typify the division of the kingdom of Israel, and Zedekiah made horns of iron to encourage Ahab to engage in war with Ramoth-gilead. King Joash, at the command of the prophet Elisha, shot arrows from the open window into the air, to symbolize the destruction of his enemies.

Isaiah walked naked and barefoot to show how the Egyptians and Ethiopians would be treated when taken captive by the Assyrians, while Jeremiah wore a yoke upon his neck to induce the nations to submit to the King of Assyria. Ezekiel was commanded to inscribe the names of certain tribes upon separate pieces of wood, to show that God would reunite those tribes.

==On tombstones==
Some common themes appear on many Jewish tombstones. Two hands with outspread fingers indicated that the dead man was descended from priestly stock (&quot;Kohanim&quot;) who blessed the people in this fashion, and a jug was carved on the tombstones of the Levites as an emblem of those who washed the priest&#x27;s hands before he pronounced the blessing.

Some gravestones show a tree with branches either outspread or broken off, symbolizing the death of a young man or an old man respectively; or they have a cluster of grapes as an emblem of Israel.

The Star of David (&quot;Magen David&quot;) occurs frequently.

Sometimes figures symbolized the name of the deceased, as the figure of a lion for Loeb, a wolf for Benjamin, and a rose for the name Bluma/Blume.
== On wimpels ==
Jewish symbols are prevalent on wimpels; Torah binders made from the cloth used to swaddle a child on his Brit Milah. Common themes and symbols are linked to positive wishes for the life of the child. 

On Ashkenazi Torah binders, the inscriptions often follow the same pattern. After naming the son then the father and other relevant data, a standardised saying follows; the boy should grow to the chuppa (marriage canopy) and good deeds under the guidance of the Torah. 

These sentences are usually illustrated with paintings or embroidery. Common symbols include plants or flowers, symbolising the tree of life (often equated with the Torah), a chuppa (to illustrate the wish for a marriage under the guidance of the Torah), a Torah scroll and crown, and animals. These can reflect the zodiac constellation under which a child was born, or be a reference to their name and heritage. Deer might give an indication of the name Zvi (Hebrew), Hirsch (German) or Herschl (Yiddish), whereas a lion might symbolise the name Löw/Ariel. Lions are also associated with the Tribes of Israel, Judah and Dan.

==The land of Zion==
Zion is a Biblical term that refers to Jerusalem (and to some extent the whole Land of Israel), and is the source for the modern term Zionism. Mount Zion is a hill outside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, but the term previously referred to the Temple Mount, as well as a hill in the City of David.

== Tribes of Israel ==
Various symbols have been attributed to the Twelve Tribes of Israel, most notably the Lion of Judah and the priestly breastplate of Levi.

Symbols attributed to the 12 tribes:

* Reuben: water ()
* Simeon: the gates of Shechem (Midrash BaMidbar Rabbah 2:7)
* Levi: priestly breastplate
* Judah: lion ()
* Issachar: sun and moon, scrolls
* Zebulun: ship ()
* Dan: snake (), scales
* Naphtali: deer ()
* Gad: tents
* Asher: oil or an olive tree ()
* Benjamin: two hills (), wolf
* Joseph: bull (), grain
** Ephraim:
** Manasseh:

== Heraldry ==

Historically Jews who carried arms often use the iconography of the Lion of Judah, the Star of David, and if they were Kohens, the symbol of two hands performing the priestly benediction. However in recent years Jews granted armorial bearings often implement Zionist symbolism.

<doc id="344428" wikidata="Q5446906" url="?curid=344428" title="Field Eugene Kindley">
<text>Captain Field Eugene Kindley (13 March 1896 – 2 February 1920) was an American aviator and World War I flying ace credited with twelve confirmed aerial victories.

==Early life==
Field Eugene Kindley was born at Pea Ridge in northwestern Arkansas. Kindley&#x27;s mother died when he was two years old and his father took a position in the Philippines, leaving Kindley to be raised by his grandmother in Bentonville, Arkansas until the age of seven. Kindley joined his father in Manila, where he lived until 1908, when he moved to Gravette, Arkansas to live with his uncle. After completing his education he moved to Coffeyville, Kansas where he became a partner in a motion picture theater.

==Military service==
During his stay in Coffeyville, Kindley enlisted in the Kansas Army National Guard. Kindley volunteered for a transfer into the aviation branch of the United States Army Signal Corps. He attended the School of Military Aeronautics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Kindley established himself as an unlucky and somewhat untalented flier, with a series of accidents, mechanical failures, and landing mishaps. He became part of the first group of American pilots to be transferred to England for combat training in 1917. In the spring of 1918, he completed training and commissioned as a first lieutenant in the United States Army Air Service.

On his first flight, he was assigned to ferry a Sopwith Camel from England to the western front, but crashed on the White Cliffs of Dover. Kindley was sent to hospital to recover. After his release, Kindley was assigned to the Royal Air Force&#x27;s No. 65 Squadron, and scored his first aerial victory on 26 June 1918 over Albert, France shooting down the Pfalz D.III of Lt. Wilhelm Lehmann, commander of Jagdstaffel 5. The citation for his first DSC reads:

The second DSC citation reads:

In July 1918, the United States Army formed the 148th Aero Squadron and assigned Kindley to the unit. Kindley shot down a German Albatros D.V near Ypres and earned the unit its first kill. Kindley was the appointed commanding officer of the 148th and promoted to captain. While with the 148th he scored 11 confirmed kills.

His fourth kill on 13 August 1918 was the Jasta 11 Fokker D.VII of Lothar von Richthofen, brother of &quot;The Red Baron,&quot; Manfred von Richthofen. Lothar von Richthofen, one of Germany&#x27;s finest fliers with 40 confirmed air-to-air victories, was seriously wounded and never flew in combat again.

Kindley scored four more victories in early September. Then, during missions in late September 1918, Kindley earned the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), Distinguished Service Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster and the British Distinguished Flying Cross.

On 24 September, he led a flight of Camels in a successful attack on seven Fokkers near Bourlon Wood, France. Three days later, Kindley earned the Oak Leaf Cluster to the DSC by dropping bombs on and strafing German infantry, destroying a German observation balloon, taking out a German machine gun nest, shooting down an enemy airplane, and scaring two Fokker biplanes away from fellow fliers even after his ammunition had been exhausted.


==Postwar military career and death==
In 1919, Kindley was offered a contract by a New York-based motion picture company to re-enact his war service. The company offered him $60 per day for two weeks which was an extremely high wage. Kindley refused the job because he thought it might interfere with his army career.

In early 1920, Kindley was the commanding officer of the 94th Aero Squadron.

Kindley died in a crash at Kelly Field near San Antonio, Texas during a demonstration flight for General John J. Pershing. A control cable snapped on the S.E.5 Kindley was flying. It stalled and fell from an altitude of . Kindley is buried at Hillcrest Cemetery in Gravette, Arkansas. With his death, command of the 94th Aero Squadron was taken over by Captain J. O. Donaldson.

==Honors==
A city park in Gravette is named for Kindley, as is the high school in Coffeyville, Kansas. Kindley Air Force Base, also known as Kindley Field, a World War II airfield in Bermuda, was named in his honor, as was Kindley Field in the Philippines, a small auxiliary airstrip on Corregidor. The Kindley home has been acquired by the Gravette City Museum. Kindley&#x27;s personal effects are on display at the Arkansas Air Museum in Fayetteville, Arkansas. A Sopwith Camel F.1 said to be Kindley&#x27;s and claimed to be the only surviving Camel in the United States, was used during the filming of &quot;The Blue Max,&quot; released in 1966, and had been on loan to the Aerospace Education Center in Little Rock, Arkansas. Aerospace Education Center permanently closed 1 Jan. 2011.

Arkansas Aviation Historical Society inducted Kindley into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 1982.

<text>has been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (&quot;fusuma&quot;) and other traditional partitions were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.

The earliest Japanese architecture was seen in prehistoric times in simple pit-houses and stores adapted to the needs of a hunter-gatherer population. Influence from Han dynasty China via Korea saw the introduction of more complex grain stores and ceremonial burial chambers.

The introduction of Buddhism in Japan during the sixth century was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese Sui and Tang dynasties led to the foundation of the first permanent capital in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang&#x27;an as a template for its design.

In 894 during the Heian period (794–1185), Japan abolished &quot;kentōshi&quot; (Japanese missions to Tang China) and began to distance itself from Chinese culture, and a culture called &quot;Kokufu bunka&quot; (lit., Japanese culture) which was suited to the Japanese climate and aesthetic sense flourished. The &quot;shinden-zukuri&quot; style, which was the architectural style of the residences of nobles in this period, showed the distinct uniqueness of Japanese architecture and permanently determined the characteristics of later Japanese architecture. Its features are an open structure with few walls that can be opened and closed with doors, &quot;shitomi&quot; and &quot;sudare&quot;, a structure in which shoes are taken off to enter the house on stilts, and sitting or sleeping directly on &quot;tatami&quot; mats without using chairs and beds.

As the samurai class gained power in the Kamakura period (1185–1333), the &quot;shinden-zukuri&quot; style changed, and in the Muromachi period (1333–1573), the &quot;shoin-zukuri&quot; style appeared. This style had a lasting influence on later Japanese architectural styles and became the basis of modern Japanese houses. Its characteristics were that sliding doors called &quot;fusuma&quot; and paper windows called &quot;shōji&quot; were fully adopted, and &quot;tatami&quot; mats were laid all over the room.

The introduction of the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy. In the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600), sukiya-zukuri style villas appeared under the influence of a tea house called &quot;chashitsu&quot;. At first it was an architectural style for the villas of &quot;daimyo&quot; (Japanese feudal lords) and court nobles, but in the Edo period (1683–1807) it was applied to &quot;ryōtei&quot; (Japanese-style restaurants) and &quot;chashitsu&quot;, and later it was also applied to residences.

During the Meiji Restoration of 1869 the history of Japanese architecture was radically changed by two important events. The first was the Kami and Buddhas Separation Act of 1868, which formally separated Buddhism from Shinto and Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines, breaking an association between the two which had lasted well over a thousand years. Secondly, it was then that Japan underwent a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially, architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan, but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with Western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements, like Metabolism.

== General features of Japanese traditional architecture ==
In traditional Japanese architecture, there are various styles, features and techniques unique to Japan in each period and use, such as residence, castle, Buddhist temple and Shinto shrine. On the other hand, especially in ancient times, it was strongly influenced by Chinese culture like other Asian countries, so it has characteristics common to architecture in Asian countries.

Partly due, also, to the variety of climates in Japan, and the millennium encompassed between the first cultural import and the last, the result is extremely heterogeneous, but several practically universal features can nonetheless be found. First of all is the choice of materials, always wood in various forms (planks, straw, tree bark, paper, etc.) for almost all structures. Unlike both Western and some Chinese architecture, the use of stone is avoided except for certain specific uses, for example temple podia and pagoda foundations.

The general structure is almost always the same: posts and lintels support a large and gently curved roof, while the walls are paper-thin, often movable and never load-bearing. Arches and barrel roofs are completely absent. Gable and eave curves are gentler than in China and columnar entasis (convexity at the center) limited.
The roof is the most visually impressive component, often constituting half the size of the whole edifice. The slightly curved eaves extend far beyond the walls, covering verandas, and their weight must therefore be supported by complex bracket systems called &quot;tokyō&quot;, in the case of temples and shrines. Simpler solutions are adopted in domestic structures. The oversize eaves give the interior a characteristic dimness, which contributes to the building&#x27;s atmosphere. The interior of the building normally consists of a single room at the center called &quot;moya&quot;, from which depart any other less important spaces.

Inner space divisions are fluid, and room size can be modified through the use of screens or movable paper walls. The large, single space offered by the main hall can therefore be divided according to the need. For example, some walls can be removed and different rooms joined temporarily to make space for some more guests. The separation between inside and outside is itself in some measure not absolute as entire walls can be removed, opening a residence or temple to visitors. Verandas appear to be part of the building to an outsider, but part of the external world to those in the building. Structures are therefore made to a certain extent part of their environment. Care is taken to blend the edifice into the surrounding natural environment.

The use of construction modules keeps proportions between different parts of the edifice constant, preserving its overall harmony. (On the subject of building proportions, see also the article &quot;ken&quot;).

Even in cases as that of Nikkō Tōshō-gū, where every available space is heavily decorated, ornamentation tends to follow, and therefore emphasize, rather than hide, basic structures.

Being shared by both sacred and profane architecture, these features made it easy converting a lay building into a temple or vice versa. This happened for example at Hōryū-ji, where a noblewoman&#x27;s mansion was transformed into a religious building.

==Prehistoric period==

The prehistoric period includes the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods stretching from approximately 5000 BCE to the beginning of the eighth century CE.

During the three phases of the Jōmon period the population was primarily hunter-gatherer with some primitive agriculture skills and their behaviour was predominantly determined by changes in climatic conditions and other natural stimulants. Early dwellings were pit houses consisting of shallow pits with tamped earth floors and grass roofs designed to collect rainwater with the aid of storage jars. Later in the period, a colder climate with greater rainfall led to a decline in population, which contributed to an interest in ritual. Concentric stone circles first appeared during this time.

During the Yayoi period, the Japanese people began to interact with the Chinese Han dynasty, whose knowledge and technical skills began to influence them. The Japanese began to build raised-floor storehouses as granaries, which were constructed using metal tools like saws and chisels that began to appear at this time. A reconstruction in Toro, Shizuoka is a wooden box made of thick boards joined in the corners in a log cabin style and supported on eight pillars. The roof is thatched but, unlike the typically hipped roof of the pit dwellings, it is a simple V-shaped gable. Some authors credit the raised structure designs of this period to contact with the rice-cultivating Austronesian peoples from coastal eastern China or Taiwan, rather than the Han.

The Kofun period marked the appearance of many-chambered burial mounds or tumuli (&quot;kofun&quot; literally means &quot;old mounds&quot;). Similar mounds in Korean Peninsula are thought to have been influenced by Japan. Early in the period, the tombs, known as &quot;keyhole &quot;kofun&quot;&quot; or , often made use of the existing topography, shaping it and adding man-made moats to form a distinctive keyhole shape, i.e. that of a circle interconnected with a triangle. Access was via a vertical shaft that was sealed off once the burial was completed. There was room inside the chamber for a coffin and grave goods. The mounds were often decorated with terracotta figures called &quot;haniwa&quot;. Later in the period mounds began to be located on flat ground and their scale greatly increased. Among many examples in Nara and Osaka, the most notable is the &quot;Daisen-kofun&quot;, designated as the tomb of Emperor Nintoku. The tomb covers and it is thought to have been decorated with 20,000 &quot;haniwa&quot; figures.

Towards the end of the Kofun period, tomb burials faded out as Buddhist cremation ceremonies gained popularity.

== Asuka and Nara architecture ==

The most significant contributor to architectural changes during the Asuka period was the introduction of Buddhism. New temples became centers of worship with tomb burial practices quickly becoming outlawed. Also, Buddhism brought with it the idea of permanent shrines and gave to Shinto architecture much of its present vocabulary.

Some of the earliest structures still extant in Japan are Buddhist temples established at this time. The oldest surviving wooden buildings in the world are found at Hōryū-ji, northeast of Nara. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown Prince Shōtoku, it consists of 41 independent buildings; the most important ones, the main worship hall, or &quot;Kon-dō&quot; (金堂, Golden Hall), and the five-story pagoda), stand in the centre of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister (&quot;kairō&quot;). The Kon-dō, in the style of Chinese worship halls, is a two-story structure of post-and-beam construction, capped by an &quot;irimoya&quot;, or hipped-gabled, roof of ceramic tiles.

Heijō-kyō, modern day Nara, was founded in 708 as the first permanent capital of the state of Japan. The layout of its checkerboard streets and buildings were modeled after the Chinese capital of Chang&#x27;an. The city soon became an important centre of Buddhist worship in Japan. The most grandiose of these temples was Tōdai-ji, built to rival temples of the Chinese Tang and Sui dynasties. Appropriately, the 16.2-m (53-ft) Buddha or Daibutsu (completed in 752) enshrined in the main hall is a Rushana Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as Tōdai-ji represented the centre for imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the Edo period. Clustered around the main hall (the Daibutsuden) on a gently sloping hillside are a number of secondary halls: the Hokke-dō (Lotus Sutra Hall), and the storehouse, called the Shōsō-in, and the adjoining Kōfuku-ji. This last structure is of great importance as an art-historical cache, because in it are stored the utensils that were used in the temple&#x27;s dedication ceremony in 752, as well as government documents and many secular objects owned by the imperial family.

== Heian period ==
Although the network of Buddhist temples across the country acted as a catalyst for an exploration of architecture and culture, this also led to the clergy gaining increased power and influence. Emperor Kanmu decided to escape this influence by moving his capital first to Nagaoka-kyō and then to Heian-kyō, known today as Kyōto. Although the layout of the city was similar to Nara&#x27;s and inspired by Chinese precedents, the palaces, temples and dwellings began to show examples of local Japanese taste.

Heavy materials like stone, mortar and clay were abandoned as building elements, with simple wooden walls, floors and partitions becoming prevalent. Native species like cedar (&quot;sugi&quot;) were popular as an interior finish because of its prominent grain, while pine (&quot;matsu&quot;) and larch (&quot;aka matsu&quot;) were common for structural uses. Brick roofing tiles and a type of cypress called &quot;hinoki&quot; were used for roofs. It was sometime during this period that the hidden roof, a uniquely Japanese solution to roof drainage problems, was adopted.

The increasing size of buildings in the capital led to an architecture reliant on columns regularly spaced in accordance with the &quot;ken&quot;, a traditional measure of both size and proportion. The imperial palace &quot;Shishinden&quot; demonstrated a style that was a precursor to the later aristocratic-style of building known as &quot;shinden-zukuri&quot;. The style was characterised by symmetrical buildings placed as arms that defined an inner garden. This garden then used borrowed scenery to seemingly blend with the wider landscape. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design.
In 894, Japan abolished &quot;kentōshi&quot; (Japanese missions to Tang China) and began to distance itself from Chinese culture, and a culture called &quot;Kokufu bunka&quot; (lit., Japanese culture) which was suited to the Japanese climate and aesthetic sense flourished. The &quot;shinden-zukuri&quot; style, which was the architectural style of the residences of nobles in this period, showed the distinct uniqueness of Japanese architecture and permanently determined the characteristics of later Japanese architecture. Its features are an open structure with few walls that can be opened and closed with doors and &quot;shitomi&quot; and &quot;sudare&quot;, a structure in which shoes are taken off to enter the house on stilts, sitting or sleeping directly on &quot;tatami&quot; mats without using chairs and beds, a roof made of laminated &quot;hinoki&quot; (Japanese cypress) bark instead of ceramic tiles, and a natural texture that is not painted on pillars. A Buddhist architectural style called &quot;Wayō&quot;, which developed in accordance with the Japanese climate and aesthetic sense, was established.

The priest Kūkai (best known by the posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) journeyed to China to study Shingon, a form of Vajrayana Buddhism, which he introduced into Japan in 806. At the core of Shingon worship are the various mandalas, diagrams of the spiritual universe that influenced temple design. The temples erected for this new sect were built in the mountains, far away from the court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced their designers to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design.

At this time the architectural style of Buddhist temples began to influence that of the Shintō shrines. For example, like their Buddhist counterparts the Shintō shrines began to paint the normally unfinished timbers with the characteristic red cinnabar colour.

During the later part of the Heian period there were the first documented appearances of vernacular houses in the &quot;minka&quot; style/form. These were characterized by the use local materials and labor, being primarily constructed of wood, having packed earth floors and thatched roofs.

== Kamakura and Muromachi periods ==
During the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and the following Muromachi period (1336–1573), Japanese Buddhist architecture made technological advances that made it diverge from its Chinese counterpart. In response to native requirements such as earthquake resistance and shelter against heavy rainfall and the summer heat and sun, the master carpenters of this time responded with a unique type of architecture, creating the &quot;Daibutsuyō&quot; and &quot;Zenshūyō&quot; styles. The &quot;Wayō&quot; style was combined with &quot;Daibutsuyō&quot; and the &quot;Zenshūyō&quot; to create the &quot;Shin-Wayō&quot; and the &quot;Setchūyō&quot; styles, and the number of temples in the pure &quot;Wayō&quot; style decreased after the 14th century.

The Kamakura period began with the transfer of power in Japan from the imperial court to the Kamakura shogunate. During the Genpei War (1180–1185), many traditional buildings in Nara and Kyoto were damaged. For example, Kōfuku-ji and Tōdai-ji were burned down by Taira no Shigehira of the Taira clan in 1180. Many of these temples and shrines were later rebuilt by the Kamakura shogunate to consolidate the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s authority.

Although less elaborate than during the Heian period, architecture in the Kamakura period was informed by a simplicity due to its association with the military order. New residences used a &quot;buke-zukuri&quot; style that was associated with buildings surrounded by narrow moats or stockades. Defense became a priority, with buildings grouped under a single roof rather than around a garden. The gardens of the Heian period houses often became training grounds.

After the fall of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, the Ashikaga shogunate was formed, having later its seat in the Kyoto district of Muromachi. The proximity of the shogunate to the imperial court led to a rivalry in the upper levels of society which caused tendencies toward luxurious goods and lifestyles. Aristocratic houses were adapted from the simple &quot;buke-zukuri&quot; style to resemble the earlier &quot;shinden-zukuri&quot; style. A good example of this ostentatious architecture is the Kinkaku-ji in Kyōto, which is decorated with lacquer and gold leaf, in contrast to its otherwise simple structure and plain bark roofs.
During the Muromachi period, &quot;shinden-zukuri&quot; style, which was the mainstream of the residences of Japanese nobles, declined, and &quot;shoin-zukuri&quot;, which developed from &quot;buke-zukuri&quot; of samurai class residences, became the mainstream. &quot;Shoin-zukuri&quot; had a lasting impact on later Japanese housing and is the basis of modern Japanese housing. In the old architectural style, &quot;tatami&quot; mats were laid only in a part of the room, but in the &quot;shoin-zukuri&quot; style, &quot;tatami&quot; mats were laid all over the room. In this style, sliding doors called &quot;fusuma&quot; were used to separate rooms, and an inner window called &quot;shoji&quot;, which was made by pasting paper permeable to sunlight on a wooden frame, was installed inside the wooden shutters. In the room, &quot;tokonoma&quot; (alcove for the display of art objects) and &quot;chigaidana&quot; (shelves built into the wall) were set up to decorate various things.

In an attempt to rein in the excess of the upper classes, the Zen masters introduced the tea ceremony. In architecture this promoted the design of &quot;chashitsu&quot; (tea houses) to a modest size with simple detailing and materials. A typically sized &quot;Chashitsu&quot; is 4 1/2 &quot;tatami&quot; mats in size.

In the garden, Zen principles replaced water with sand or gravel to produce the dry garden (&quot;karesansui&quot;) like the one at Ryōan-ji.

== Azuchi-Momoyama period ==

During the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600) Japan underwent a process of unification after a long period of civil war. It was marked by the rule of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, men who built castles as symbols of their power; Nobunaga in Azuchi, the seat of his government, and Hideyoshi in Momoyama. The Ōnin War during the Muromachi period had led to rise of castle architecture in Japan. By the time of the Azuchi-Momoyama period each domain was allowed to have one castle of its own. Typically it consisted of a central tower or surrounded by gardens and fortified buildings. All of this was set within massive stone walls and surrounded by deep moats. The dark interiors of castles were often decorated by artists, the spaces were separated up using sliding &quot;fusuma&quot; panels and &quot;byōbu&quot; folding screens.

The &quot;Shoin-zukuri&quot; style in the Muromachi period continued to be refined. Verandas linked the interiors of residential buildings with highly cultivated exterior gardens. &quot;Fusuma&quot; and &quot;byōbu&quot; became highly decorated with paintings and often an interior room with shelving and alcove (&quot;tokonoma&quot;) were used to display art work (typically a hanging scroll).

During this period, sukiya-zukuri style villas appeared under the influence of a tea house called &quot;chashitsu&quot; (tea house).

Matsumoto, Kumamoto and Himeji (popularly known as the White Heron castle) are excellent examples of the castles of the period, while Nijō Castle in Kyōto is an example of castle architecture blended with that of an imperial palace, to produce a style that is more in keeping with the Chinese influence of previous centuries.

== Edo period ==
The Tokugawa shogunate took the city of Edo (later to become part of modern-day Tōkyō) as their capital. They built an imposing fortress around which buildings of the state administration and residences for the provincial &quot;daimyōs&quot; were constructed. The city grew around these buildings connected by a network of roads and canals. By 1700 the population had swollen to one million inhabitants. The scarcity of space for residential architecture resulted in houses being built over two stories, often constructed on raised stone plinths.

Although &quot;machiya&quot; (townhouses) had been around since the Heian period they began to be refined during the Edo period. &quot;Machiya&quot; typically occupied deep, narrow plots abutting the street (the width of the plot was usually indicative of the wealth of the owner), often with a workshop or shop on the ground floor. Tiles rather than thatch were used on the roof and exposed timbers were often plastered in an effort to protect the building against fire. Ostentatious buildings that demonstrated the wealth and power of the feudal lords were constructed, such as the Kamiyashiki of Matsudaira Tadamasa or the Ōzone Shimoyashiki.

Edo suffered badly from devastating fires and the 1657 Great Fire of Meireki was a turning point in urban design. Initially, as a method of reducing fire spread, the government built stone embankments in at least two locations along rivers in the city. Over time these were torn down and replaced with &quot;dōzō&quot; storehouses that were used both as fire breaks and to store goods unloaded from the canals. The &quot;dōzō&quot; were built with a structural frame made of timber coated with a number of layers of earthen plaster on the walls, door and roof. Above the earthen roofs was a timber framework supporting a tiled roof. Although Japanese who had studied with the Dutch at their settlement in Dejima advocated building with stone and brick this was not undertaken because of their vulnerability to earthquakes. &quot;Machiya&quot; and storehouses from the later part of the period are characterised by having a black coloration to the external plaster walls. This colour was made by adding India ink to burnt lime and crushed oyster shell.

The clean lines of the civil architecture in Edo influenced the &quot;sukiya&quot; style of residential architecture. Katsura Detached Palace and Shugaku-in Imperial Villa on the outskirts of Kyōto are good examples of this style. Their architecture has simple lines and decor and uses wood in its natural state. The &quot;sukiya&quot; style was applied not only to villas but also to &quot;ryōtei&quot; (Japanese-style restaurants) and &quot;chashitsu&quot;, and later it was also applied to residences.

In the very late part of the period &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot;, the law requiring the &quot;daimyōs&quot; to maintain dwellings in the capital was repealed which resulted in a decrease in population in Edo and a commensurate reduction in income for the shogunate.

== Meiji, Taishō, and early Shōwa periods ==
Towards the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, Western influence in architecture began to show in buildings associated with the military and trade, especially naval and industrial facilities. After the Emperor Meiji was restored to power (known as the Meiji Restoration) Japan began a rapid process of Westernization which led to the need for new building types such as schools, banks and hotels.
Early Meiji Architecture was initially influenced by colonial architecture in Chinese treaty ports such as Hong Kong. In Nagasaki, the British trader Thomas Glover built his own house in just such a style using the skill of local carpenters. His influence helped the career of architect who designed the Osaka Mint in 1868, a long, low building in brick and stone with a central pedimented portico. In Tōkyō, Waters designed the Commercial Museum, thought to have been the city&#x27;s first brick building.

In Tokyo, after the Tsukiji area burnt to the ground in 1872, the government designated the Ginza area as model of modernization. The government planned the construction of fireproof brick buildings, and larger, better streets connecting the Shimbashi Station and the foreign concession in Tsukiji, as well as to important government buildings. Designs for the area were provided by the British architect Thomas James Waters; the Bureau of Construction of the Ministry of Finance was in charge of construction. In the following year, a Western-style Ginza was completed. &quot;Bricktown&quot; buildings were initially offered for sale, later they were leased, but the high rent meant that many remained unoccupied. Nevertheless, the area flourished as a symbol of &quot;civilization and enlightenment&quot;, thanks to the presence of newspapers and magazine companies, who led the trends of the day. The area was also known for its window displays, an example of modern marketing techniques. The &quot;Bricktown&quot; of Ginza served as a model for many other modernization schemes in Japanese cities.

One of the prime examples of early western architecture was the &quot;Rokumeikan&quot;, a large two-story building in Tokyo, completed in 1883, which was to become a controversial symbol of Westernisation in the Meiji period. Commissioned for the housing of foreign guests by the Foreign Minister Inoue Kaoru, it was designed by , a prominent foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan (&quot;o-yatoi gaikokujin&quot;). The &quot;Ryōunkaku&quot; was Japan&#x27;s first western-style skyscraper, constructed in 1890 in Asakusa. However traditional architecture was still employed for new buildings, such as the &quot;Kyūden&quot; of Tokyo Imperial Palace, albeit with token western elements such as a spouting water fountain in the gardens.

In contrast to Waters&#x27;s neoclassical style building, Japanese carpenters developed a pseudo-Japanese style known as &quot;giyōfū&quot; chiefly using wood. A good example of which is Kaichi Primary School in Nagano Prefecture built in 1876. The master carpenter Tateishi Kiyoshige travelled to Tōkyō to see which Western building styles were popular and incorporated these in the school with traditional building methods. Constructed with a similar method to traditional () storehouses, the wooden building plastered inside and out incorporates an octagonal Chinese tower and has stone-like quoins to the corners. Traditional namako plasterwork was used at the base of the walls to give the impression that the building sits on a stone base. Another example was the First National Bank building in Tokyo, built in 1872.

The Japanese government also invited foreign architects to both work in Japan and teach new Japanese architects. One of these, the British architect went on to train many of the most prominent of the Japanese Meiji era architects, including Kingo Tatsuno, Tatsuzō Sone and Tokuma Katayama. Tatsuno&#x27;s early works had a Venetian style influenced by John Ruskin, but his later works such as the Bank of Japan (1896) and Tōkyō Station (1914) have a more Beaux-Arts feel. On the other hand, Katayama was more influenced by the French Second Empire style which can be seen in the Nara National Museum (1894) and the Kyōto National Museum (1895).

In 1920, a group of young architects formed the first organization of modernist architects. They were known as the &quot;Bunriha&quot;, literally &quot;Secessionist group&quot;, inspired in part by the Vienna Secessionists. These architects were worried about the reliance on historical styles and decoration and instead encouraged artistic expression. They drew their influence from European movements like Expressionism and the Bauhaus and helped pave the way towards the introduction of the International Style of Modernism.

In the Taishō and early Shōwa periods two influential American architects worked in Japan. The first was Frank Lloyd Wright who designed the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo (1913–1923) and the Yodokō Guest House (1924), both of which used locally quarried Ōya stone. Wright had a number of Japanese apprentices under his tutelage, such as Arata Endo, who constructed the Kōshien Hotel in 1930.

The second was Antonin Raymond who worked for Wright on the Imperial Hotel before leaving to set up his own practice in Tōkyō. Although his early works like Tōkyō Women&#x27;s Christian College show Wright&#x27;s influence, he soon began to experiment with the use of in-situ reinforced concrete, detailing it in way that recalled traditional Japanese construction methods. Between 1933 and 1937 Bruno Taut stayed in Japan. His writings, especially those on Katsura Imperial Villa reevaluated traditional Japanese architecture whilst bringing it to a wider audience.

As in the Meiji era experience from abroad was gained by Japanese architects working in Europe. Among these were Kunio Maekawa and Junzo Sakakura who worked at Le Corbusier&#x27;s atelier in Paris and Bunzō Yamaguchi and Chikatada Kurata who worked with Walter Gropius.

Some architects built their reputation upon works of public architecture. Togo Murano, a contemporary of Raymond, was influenced by Rationalism and designed the Morigo Shoten office building, Tōkyō (1931) and Ube Public Hall, Yamaguchi Prefecture (1937). Similarly, Tetsuro Yoshida&#x27;s rationalist modern architecture included the (1931) and Ōsaka Central Post Office (1939).

Running contrary to modernism in Japan was the so-called Imperial Crown style (&quot;teikan yōshiki&quot;). Buildings in this style were characterised by having a Japanese-style roof such as the Tōkyō Imperial Museum (1937) by Hitoshi Watanabe and Nagoya City Hall and the Aichi Prefectural Government Office. The increasingly militaristic government insisted that major buildings be designed in a &quot;Japanese Style&quot; limiting opportunities for modernist design to works of infrastructure such as Bunzō Yamaguchi&#x27;s Number 2 Power Plant for the Kurobe Dam, (1938).

A large number of buildings from the Meiji, Taishō and Shōwa eras were lost during and after World War II, such as the Rokumeikan. Taniguchi Yoshirō (谷口 吉郎, 1904–79), an architect, and Moto Tsuchikawa established Meiji Mura in 1965, close to Nagoya, where a large number of rescued buildings are re-assembled. A similar museum is the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum.

=== Colonial architecture ===
The colonial authorities constructed a large number of public buildings, many of which have survived. Examples include the large-scale concept of what is today Ketagalan Boulevard in central Zhongzheng District of Taipei that showcases the Office of the Governor-General, Taiwan Governor Museum, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei Guest House, Judicial Yuan, the Nippon Kangyo Bank and Mitsui Bussan Company buildings, as well as many examples of smaller houses found on Qidong Street.

In Korea under Japanese administration, public buildings such as train stations and city halls were also constructed in various styles. Although the largest Japanese colonial building, the immense Government-General Building, was demolished in 1995, many colonial buildings have been preserved. These include the former Keijo City Hall, today Seoul Metropolitan Library; the former Keijo station, today Old Seoul Station; the former Bank of Chosen, designed by Tatsuno Kingo, today the headquarters of the Bank of Korea; and the former branch of Mitsukoshi department store, today the flagship of Shinsegae department store.

After winning Dalian as the result of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, Japan continued to build the Russian-built city with the modern buildings on &quot;Large Square&quot;. With the conquest and establishment of the puppet state Manchukuo, massive funds and efforts were invested into the master plan for the construction of the capital city of Shinkyō (Xinjing). Many official buildings erected during the colonial period still stand today, including those of the Eight Grand Ministries of Manchukuo, the Imperial Palace, the headquarters of the Kwantung Army and Datong Avenue.

==Late Showa period==

After the war and under the influence of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, General Douglas MacArthur, Japanese political and religious life was reformed to produce a demilitarised and democratic country. Although a new constitution was established in 1947, it was not until the beginning of the Korean War that Japan (as an ally of the United States) saw a growth in its economy brought about by the manufacture of industrial goods. In 1946 the Prefabricated Housing Association was formed to try and address the chronic shortage of housing, and architects like Kunio Maekawa submitted designs. However, it was not until the passing of the Public Housing Act in 1951 that housing built by the private sector was supported in law by the government. Also in 1946, the War Damage Rehabilitation Board put forward ideas for the reconstruction of thirteen Japanese cities. Architect Kenzō Tange submitted proposals for Hiroshima and Maebashi.

In 1949, Tange&#x27;s winning competition entry to design the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum gave him international acclaim. The project (completed in 1955) led to a series of commissions including the Kagawa Prefectural Office Building in Takamatsu (1958) and Old Kurashiki City Hall (1960). At this time both Tange and Maekawa were interested in the tradition of Japanese architecture and the influence of local character. This was illustrated at Kagawa with elements of Heian period design fused with the International Style.
In 1955, Le Corbusier was asked by the Japanese government to design the National Museum of Western Art in Tōkyō. He was assisted by his three former students: Maekawa, Sakakura and Takamasa Yoshizaka. The design was based upon Le Corbusier&#x27;s museum in Ahmedabad, and both of the museums are square and raised on piloti.

Due largely to the influence of Tange, the 1960 World Design Conference was held in Tōkyō. A small group of Japanese designers who came to represent the Metabolist Movement presented their manifesto and a series of projects. The group included the architects Kiyonori Kikutake, Masato Ōtaka, Kisho Kurokawa and Fumihiko Maki. Originally known as the Burnt Ash School, the Metabolists associated themselves with idea of renewal and regeneration, rejecting visual representations of the past and promoting the idea that the individual, the house and the city were all parts of a single organism. Although the individual members of the group went in their own directions after a few years the enduring nature of their publications meant that they had a longer presence overseas. The international symbol of the Metabolists, the capsule, emerged as an idea in the late 1960s and was demonstrated in Kurokawa&#x27;s Nakagin Capsule Tower in Tōkyō in 1972.

In the 1960s Japan saw both the rise and the expansion of large construction firms, including the Shimizu Corporation and Kajima. Nikken Sekkei emerged as a comprehensive company that often included elements of Metabolist design in its buildings.

The 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo saw a large boost to new design. Venues were constructed and the Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built between 1961 and 1964 by Kenzo Tange, became a landmark structure famous for its suspension roof design, recalling traditional elements of Shinto shrines. Other structures include the Nippon Budokan, the Komazawa Gymnasium and many others. The Olympic Games symbolised the re-emergence of Japan after the destruction of World War II, reflecting the new confidence in its architecture.

During the 1960s there were also architects who did not see the world of architecture in terms of Metabolism. For example, Kazuo Shinohara specialised in small residential projects in which he explored traditional architecture with simple elements in terms of space, abstraction and symbolism. In the Umbrella House (1961) he explored the spatial relationship between the &quot;doma&quot; (earth-paved internal floor) and the raised tatami floor in the living room and sleeping room. This relationship was explored further with the House with an Earthen floor (1963) where a tamped-down earthen floor was included in the kitchen area. His use of a roof to anchor his design for the House in White (1966) has been compared with Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Prairie Houses. Shinohara explored these abstractions as &quot;Three Styles&quot;, which were periods of design that stretched from the early sixties to the mid seventies.

A former employee of Kenzo Tange was Arata Isozaki who was initially interested in the Metabolist Movement and produced innovative theoretical projects for the City in the Air (1961) and Future City (1962). However he soon moved away from this towards a more Mannerist approach similar to the work of James Stirling. This was particularly striking at the Oita Branch for Fukuoka Mutual (1967) with its mathematical grids, concrete construction and exposed services. In the Gunma Prefectural Museum (1971–74) he experimented with cubic elements (some of them twelve metres to a side) overlaid by a secondary grid expressed by the external wall panels and fenestration. This rhythm of panelling may have been influenced by Corbusier&#x27;s detailing on the Museum of Western Art in Tōkyō.

Japanese cities where they lack European-like piazzas and squares often emphasise the relationship of people with the everyday workings of the street. Fumihiko Maki was one of a number of architects who were interested in the relationship of architecture and the city and this can be seen in works like Ōsaka Prefectural Sports Centre (1972) and Spiral in Tōkyō (1985). Likewise, Takefumi Aida (member of the group known as ArchiteXt) rejected the ideas of the Metabolist Movement and explored urban semiology.
In the late seventies and early eighties Tadao Ando&#x27;s architecture and theoretical writings explored the idea of Critical regionalism – the idea of promoting local or national culture within architecture. Ando&#x27;s interpretation of this was demonstrated by his idea of reacquainting the Japanese house with nature, a relationship he thought had been lost with Modernist architecture. His first projects were for small urban houses with enclosed courtyards (such as the Azuma House in Ōsaka in 1976). His architecture is characterised by the use of concrete, but it has been important for him to use the interplay of light, through time, with this and other materials in his work. His ideas about the integration of nature converted well into larger projects such as the Rokkō Housing 1 (1983) (on a steep site on Mount Rokkō) and the Church on the Water (1988) in Tomamu, Hokkaidō.

The late eighties saw the first work by architects of the so-called &quot;Shinohara&quot; school. This included Toyō Itō and Itsuko Hasegawa who were both interested in urban life and the contemporary city. Itō concentrated on the dynamism and mobility of the city&#x27;s &quot;urban nomads&quot; with projects like the Tower of Winds (1986) which integrated natural elements like light and wind with those of technology. Hasegawa concentrated on what she termed &quot;architecture as another nature&quot;. Her Shōnandai Cultural Centre in Fujisawa (1991) combined the natural environment with new high-tech materials.

Highly individualist architects of the late eighties included the monumental buildings of Shin Takamatsu and the &quot;cosmic&quot; work of Masaharu Takasaki. Takasaki, who worked with the Austrian architect Günther Domenig in the 1970s shares Domenig&#x27;s organic architecture. His Zero Cosmology House of 1991 in Kagoshima Prefecture constructed from concrete has a contemplative egg-shaped &quot;zero space&quot; at its centre.

==Heisei period==
The Heisei period began with the collapse of the so-called &quot;bubble economy&quot; that had previously boosted Japan&#x27;s economy. Commissions for commercial works of architecture virtually dried up and architects relied upon government and prefectural organisations to provide projects.

Building on elements from the Shōnandai Culture Centre, Itsuko Hasegawa undertook a number cultural and community centres throughout Japan. These included the Sumida Cultural Centre (1995) and the Fukuroi Community Centre (2001) where she involved the public in the process of design whilst exploring her own ideas about the filtration of light through the external walls into the interior. In his 1995 competition win for Sendai Mediatheque, Toyō Itō continued his earlier thoughts about fluid dynamics within the modern city with &quot;seaweed-like&quot; columns supporting a seven-story building wrapped in glass. His work later in the period, for example, the library to Tama Art University in Tōkyō in 2007 demonstrates more expressive forms, rather than the engineered aesthetic of his earlier works.

Although Tadao Ando became well known for his use of concrete, he began the decade designing the Japanese pavilion at the Seville Exposition 1992, with a building that was hailed as &quot;the largest wooden structure in the world&quot;. He continued with this medium in projects for the Museum of Wood Culture, Kami, Hyōgo Prefecture (1994) and the Komyo-ji Shrine in Saijo (2001).

The UK practice, Foreign Office Architects won an international competition in 1994 to design the Yokohama International Port Terminal. It is an undulating structure that emerges from the surrounding city and forms a building to walk over as well as into. Klein Dytham Architecture are one of a handful of foreign architects who managed to gain a strong foothold in Japan. Their design for Moku Moku Yu (literally &quot;wood wood steam&quot;), a communal bathhouse in Kobuchizawa, Yamanashi Prefecture in 2004 is a series of interconnected circular pools and changing rooms, flat-roofed and clad in coloured vertical timbers.

After the 1995 Kōbe earthquake, Shigeru Ban developed cardboard tubes that could be used to quickly construct refugee shelters that were dubbed &quot;Paper Houses&quot;. Also as part of that relief effort he designed a church using 58 cardboard tubes that were 5m high and had a tensile roof that opened up like an umbrella. The church was erected by Roman Catholic volunteers in five weeks. For the Nomadic Museum, Ban used walls made of shipping containers, stacked four high and joined at the corners with twist connectors that produced a checkerboard effect of solid and void. The ancillary spaces were made with paper tubes and honeycomb panels. The museum was designed to be disassembled and it subsequently moved from New York, to Santa Monica, Tōkyō and Mexico.

Historian and architect Terunobu Fujimori&#x27;s studies in the 1980s into so-called architectural curios found in the city inspired the work of a younger generation of architects such as the founders of Atelier Bow-Wow. Yoshiharu Tsukamoto and Momoyo Kajima surveyed the city for &quot;no-good&quot; architecture for their book &quot;Made in Tokyo&quot; in 2001. Their work in turn seeks to embrace its context rather than block it out. Although their office in Tōkyō is on a tight site they have welcomed the city in with huge windows and spacious porches.

Sou Fujimoto&#x27;s architecture relies upon a manipulation of basic building blocks to produce a geometric primitivism. His buildings are very sensitive to the topographical form of their context and include a series of houses as well as a children&#x27;s home in Hokkaidō.

Two former employees of Toyō Itō, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa formed a collaborative partnership in 1995 called SANAA. They are known for creating lightweight, transparent spaces that expose the fluidity and movement of their occupants. Their Dior store in Shibuya, Tōkyō, in 2001 was reminiscent of Itō&#x27;s Mediatheque, with cool white acrylic sheets on the external facade that filter the light and partially reveal the store&#x27;s contents. Their dynamic of fluidity is demonstrated by the Rolex Learning Centre at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, completed in 2010. This building has an undulating floor plane set under a continuous concrete shell roof that was poured in one go over two days. The plan is like a biological cell punctuated with tables and courtyards alike. In 2009 they designed the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in London that comprised a reflective, floating aluminium roof supported by slender columns.

== Japanese interior design ==
Japanese interior design has a unique aesthetic derived from Shinto, Taoism, Zen Buddhism, world view of &quot;wabi-sabi&quot;, specific religious figures and the West. This aesthetic has in turn influenced Western style, particularly Modernism.

=== Traditional Japanese aesthetic ===
What is generally identified as the Japanese aesthetic stems from ideals of Japanese Shinto and Chinese Taoism. Japanese culture is extremely diverse; despite this, in terms of the interior, the aesthetic is one of simplicity and minimalism.

The specific idea that a room&#x27;s true beauty is in the empty space within the roof and walls came from Laozi, a philosopher and the founder of Taoism, who held to the &quot;aesthetic ideal of emptiness&quot;, believing that the mood should be captured in the imagination, and not so heavily dictated by what is physically present. Japanese design is based strongly on craftsmanship, beauty, elaboration, and delicacy. The design of interiors is very simple but made with attention to detail and intricacy. This sense of intricacy and simplicity in Japanese designs is still valued in modern Japan as it was in traditional Japan.

Interiors are very simple, highlighting minimal and natural decoration. Traditional Japanese interiors, as well as modern, incorporate mainly natural materials including fine woods, bamboo, silk, rice straw mats, and paper &quot;shōji&quot; screens. Natural materials are used to keep simplicity in the space that connects to nature. Natural color schemes are used and neutral palettes including black, white, off-white, gray, and brown.

Impermanence is a strong theme in traditional Japanese dwellings. The size of rooms can be altered by interior sliding walls or screens, the already mentioned &quot;shōji&quot;. Cupboards built smoothly into the wall hide futon, mattresses pulled out before going to bed, allowing more space to be available during the day. The versatility of these dwellings becomes more apparent with changes of seasons. In summer, for example, exterior walls can be opened to bring the garden and cooling breezes in. The minimal decoration also alters seasonally, with a different scroll hanging or new flower arrangement.

The Japanese aesthetic developed further with the celebration of imperfection and insufficiency, characteristics resulting from the natural ageing process or darkening effect. Shinto, the indigenous religious tradition of Japan, provides a basis for the appreciation of these qualities, holding to a philosophy of appreciation of life and the world. Sei Shōnagon was a trend-setting court lady of the tenth century who wrote in &#x27;The Pillow Book&#x27; of her dislike for &quot;a new cloth screen with a colourful and cluttered painting of many cherry blossoms&quot;, preferring instead to notice &quot;that one&#x27;s elegant Chinese mirror has become a little cloudy&quot;. Her taste was not out of place in the ancient Japanese court. In the twelfth century a Buddhist monk, Yoshida Kenkō, exerted his influence on Japanese aesthetic sensibility resulting from his philosophy of life. He asked, &quot;Are we to look at cherry blossoms only in full bloom, the moon only when it is cloudless? ...Branches about to blossom or garden strewn with faded flowers are worthier of our admiration.&quot; The incomplete is also praised by Kenkō, &quot;uniformity and completeness are undesirable&quot;. Underpinning or complementing these aesthetic ideals, is the valuing of contrast; when imperfection or the impoverished is contrasted with perfection or opulence, each is emphasised and thus better appreciated.

===Traditional materials of the interior===

Japanese interior design is very efficient in the use of resources. Traditional and modern Japanese interiors have been flexible in use and designed mostly with natural materials. The spaces are used as multifunctional rooms. The rooms can be opened to create more space for a particular occasion or for more privacy, or vice versa closed-off by pulling closed paper screens called &quot;shōji&quot;.

Japanese Zen interior designs draw inspiration from elements of nature as they have immense respect for nature. Their designs have a strong connection with natural elements such as wood, plants, natural lighting and more.

A large portion of Japanese interior walls are often made of &quot;shōji&quot; screens that can be pushed open to join two rooms together, and then close them allowing more privacy. The &quot;shōji&quot; screens are made of paper attached to thin wooden frames that roll away on a track when they are pushed. Another important feature of the &quot;shōji&quot; screen, besides privacy and seclusion, is that they allow light through. This is an important aspect to Japanese design. Paper translucent walls allow light to be diffused through the space and create light shadows and patterns.

&quot;Tatami&quot; mats are rice straw floor mats often used to cover the floor in Japan&#x27;s interiors; in modern Japanese houses there are usually only one or two &quot;tatami&quot; rooms. Another way to connect rooms in Japan&#x27;s interiors is through sliding panels made of wood and paper, like the &quot;shōji&quot; screens, or cloth. These panels are called &quot;fusuma&quot; and are used as an entire wall. They are traditionally hand painted.

&quot;Tatami&quot; are the basis of traditional Japanese architecture, regulating a building&#x27;s size and dimensions. They originated in ancient Japan when straw was laid on bare earth as a softener and warmer. In the Heian period (794–1185), this idea developed into moveable mats that could be laid anywhere in the house to sit or sleep on before becoming a permanent floor covering in the fifteenth century. &quot;Tatami&quot; are suitable for the Japanese climate because they let air circulate around the floor.

Bamboo is prominently used and even expected in the Japanese house, used both for decorative and functional purposes. Bamboo blinds, &quot;sudare&quot;, replace &quot;shoji&quot; in summer to prevent excess heat inside and also offer greater ventilation. Country dwellings and farmhouses often use it for ceilings and rafters. The natural properties of bamboo, its raw beauty with the knots and smooth surface, correspond to Japanese aesthetic ideals of imperfection, contrast and the natural.

The use of paper, or &quot;washi&quot;, in Japanese buildings is a main component in the beauty and atmosphere of the Japanese interior, the way variation of shadow combines to create a &quot;mystery of shadows&quot;. A range of papers are used for various purposes in the home.

Wood is generally used for the framework of the home, but its properties are valuable in the Japanese aesthetic, namely its warmth and irregularity.

A recessed space called &quot;tokonoma&quot; is often present in traditional as well as modern Japanese living rooms. This is the focus of the room and displays Japanese art, usually a painting or calligraphy.

===Western influence===

After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japan&#x27;s relations to Euro-American powers became more prominent and involved. This spilled into a broader interacting with the modern world, which in terms of interior design, resulted in the introduction of western style interiors, while the vernacular style came to be more associated with tradition and the past. The typical interiors found in Japanese homes and western homes in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were vastly different with almost opposing attitudes to furniture, versatility of space and materials.

Many public spaces had begun to incorporate chairs and desks by the late nineteenth century, department stores adopted western-style displays; a new &quot;urban visual and consumer culture&quot; was emerging. In the domestic sphere, the manner and dress of inhabitants were determined by the interior style, Japanese or Western. One of the examples is the &quot;Hōmei-Den&quot; of the Meiji era Tokyo Imperial Palace, which fused Japanese styles such as the coffered ceiling with western parquet floor and chandeliers.

There was a push by bureaucrats for Japan to develop into a more &quot;modern&quot; (Western) culture. The modernising of the home was considered the best way to change the daily life of the people. Much of the reason for modernisation was a desire to &quot;present a &#x27;civilised&#x27; face to the world, thus helping to secure Japan&#x27;s position as a modern nation in the world order&quot;. Even with governmental encouragement to transform the home, the majority of Japanese people still lived in fairly traditional style dwellings well into the 1920s, partly due to economic situation in the early 1910s that meant western style was out of reach for the majority of people. It was also difficult to incorporate furniture into traditional dwellings due to their small size and intended flexible use of space, a flexibility made difficult to maintain when bulky furniture was involved; it was impractical, but aesthetically incongruent too.

===Influence on the West===
Some of the earliest influence on the West came in the form of Japanese art, which gained popularity in Europe in particular, in the latter part of the nineteenth century. In terms of architecture and interior design though, the influence on the West is much more centered on the United States of America.

Before the twentieth century, very little of the West&#x27;s knowledge of the Japanese building was gained in Japan. Instead it was gained through exhibitions the Japanese partook in such as the 1876 Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia. The early influence of such exhibitions was more in the creation of an enthusiasm for things Japanese instead of something more authentic. The result was exuberant Japanese decoration, the simplicity of Japanese design lost in the clutter of Victorian ostentation.

During the twentieth century though, a number of now renowned architects visited Japan including Frank Lloyd Wright, Ralph Adams Cram, Richard Neutra and Antonin Raymond. These architects, among others, played significant roles in bringing the Japanese influence to Western modernism. Influence from the Far East was not new in America at this time. During the eighteenth and a large part of the nineteenth centuries, a taste for Chinese art and architecture existed and often resulted in a &quot;superficial copying&quot;. The Japanese influence was different however. The modernist context, and the time leading up to it, meant that architects were more concerned with &quot;the problem of building, rather than in the art of ornamenting&quot;. The simplicity of Japanese dwellings contrasted the oft-esteemed excessive decoration of the West. The influence of Japanese design was thus not so much that it was directly copied but rather, &quot;the west discovered the quality of space in traditional Japanese architecture through a filter of western architectural values&quot;.
The culture that created traditional Japanese architecture is so far removed from Western values philosophies of life that it could not be directly applied in a design context.

<text>The petaltails of the family Petaluridae are among the most ancient of the extant true dragonflies (infraorder Anisoptera), having fossil members from as early as the Jurassic, over 150 million years ago. A 2024 molecular phylogeny found that the petaltails comprise two clades, a Gondwanan clade and a Laurasian clade. Their divergence time was estimated at 160 million years ago.
Modern petalurids include only 11 species, one of which, the Australian &quot;Petalura ingentissima&quot;, is by some measurements the largest of living dragonflies, having a wingspan of up to about and a body length of about (&quot;Tetracanthagyna plagiata&quot; of another family can match or exceed its wingspan). Another large Australian species is &quot;Petalura gigantea&quot;, commonly known as the giant dragonfly. In the United States, two species are found, &quot;Tanypteryx hageni&quot; in the west and &quot;Tachopteryx thoreyi&quot; in the east. The larvae live primarily in stream banks, mostly in burrows, but the larvae of the eastern US species, &quot;Tachopteryx thoreyi&quot;, the gray petaltail, live in depressions under wet leaves. The semiaquatic habitat of the larvae makes the petaltails unique in the modern dragonfly families.

<text>The Parallel History Project on Cooperative Security (PHP) is an open source website reference compilation, research project, and analysis nexus sparked by the progressive increase in the declassification of NATO and Soviet bloc documents related to Cold War activities, as viewed by both sides. Currently, research into Soviet bloc archives has expanded the project&#x27;s scope to the Global Cold War, with views specifically on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

According to the site:

[PHP] seeks to collect, analyze, and interpret these premier sources for the study of contemporary international history. By relating them to current security issues, the PHP enhances their understanding by highlighting how they differ from the recent past. It explores how the different alliance experiences have influenced the attitudes and behavior of the present members of the enlarged NATO and the Partnership for Peace (PfP).

The Parallel History Project is based at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland and is run in partnership with the International Relations and Security Network (ISN) and the Center for Security Studies (CSS). Vojtech Mastny has been the project&#x27;s coordinator.

<doc id="344444" wikidata="Q1093783" url="?curid=344444" title="Tōson Shimazaki">
<text>was the pen-name of Haruki Shimazaki, a Japanese writer active in the Meiji, Taishō and early Shōwa periods of Japan. He began his career as a Romantic poet, but went on to establish himself as a major proponent of Japanese Naturalism. The historical novel &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; (1929-1935), about the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate, is his most popular work.

==Early life==
Shimazaki was born in the old post town of Magome-juku, Nagano Prefecture (now part of Nakatsugawa, Gifu Prefecture), as son of Masaki Shimazaki and his wife Nui. In 1881, he was sent to Tokyo by his father to acquire an education. Masaki, who showed an increasingly eccentric behaviour and suffered from hallucinations, was interned by his family in a self-built cell and died when Shimazaki was only fourteen. Shimazaki&#x27;s oldest sister Sono Takase also suffered from mental disorders in her late years.

Shimazaki was baptised in 1888 while studying at the Christian Meiji Gakuin University, where he befriended essayists and translators Baba Kochō and Shūkotsu Togawa. He took first steps in writing and contributed to a literary magazine titled &quot;Sumire-gusa&quot;, until its publication was prohibited by the university&#x27;s headmaster Yoshiharu Iwamoto. After graduating from Meiji Gakuin in 1891, Shimazaki earned a small salary by contributing translations to Iwamoto&#x27;s &quot;Jogaku zasshi&quot; magazine. He began teaching English at the Christian Meiji Women&#x27;s School (Meiji Jogakkō) the following year, but already left after a few months, partially due to his lack of teaching experience, partially due to his affection for one of his pupils. Around this time, he had his name removed from the register of the Ichibanchō church. He joined a group of writers who founded the literary magazine &quot;Bungakukai&quot;, to which he contributed his manuscripts. One of Bungakukai&#x27;s editors, writer Tōkoku Kitamura, whom Shimazaki regarded as his mentor, committed suicide in 1894. Shimazaki, who never completely got over this loss, edited two posthumous collections of Kitamura&#x27;s works.

In 1896, Shimazaki moved to Sendai in northern Japan to accept a teaching position at Tohoku Gakuin University. His first verse collection, &quot;&quot; (lit. &quot;Collection of young herbs&quot;, 1897) was published while he was in Sendai. Its success launched him on his future career, and he was regarded as one of the creators of the Meiji Romanticism literary movement. He published more poetry collections, but after the turn of the century he turned his talents to prose fiction. In 1899, he married merchant daughter Fuyuko Hata.

==Literary career==

Shimazaki&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Broken Commandment&quot;, appeared self-financed in 1906 and is widely regarded as the first Japanese Naturalist novel. The story follows a &quot;burakumin&quot; schoolteacher torn between the promise given to his father to keep his outcaste status a secret and his wish to confess his origin to people close to him. While Shimazaki was writing it, his three children died of illness. The deaths have later been ascribed to possible malnutrition as a result of the family&#x27;s financial constraints at the time of the writing, for which Shimazaki faced harsh criticism, among others from writer Naoya Shiga.

His second novel, &quot;Haru&quot; (&quot;Spring&quot;, 1908), taking its title from the Botticelli painting of the same name, was the first in a series of novels which fictionalised his biography, here the years 1893–1896, reminiscing his life among the young poets of the Romantic movement. &quot;Haru&quot; was also the first of his works to initially appear in serialised form. Like the preceding and the next novel, &quot;Haru&quot; was later published in book form in Shimazaki&#x27;s own &quot;Ryokuin sōsho&quot; (&quot;Greenshade series&quot;), which he supervised through all production steps, including the books&#x27; cover designs.

&quot;The Family&quot; (1910–1911) depicts the slow decline of two provincial families, the Koizumis and the Hashimotos, between the years 1898 and 1910. Sankichi, the youngest son of the Koizumi family, is the author&#x27;s alter ego. The novel established Shimazaki&#x27;s position in Japan&#x27;s contemporary literary world and has been widely (though not unanimously) regarded by scholars to be his masterpiece. In August 1910, Shimazaki&#x27;s first wife Fuyuko died shortly after the birth of daughter Ryūko, the fourth surviving child of seven.

In 1913, Shimazaki&#x27;s niece Komako (daughter of Shimazaki&#x27;s elder brother Hirosuke, whom he had long supported) became pregnant as a result of the affair between the two. Shimazaki fled to France to avoid the confrontation with his relatives, abandoning the girl, but eventually returned to Japan in 1916. His novel &quot;Shinsei&quot; (&quot;New life&quot;, 1918–1919), an account of his affair with Komako, his stay in France and his eventual return, created a major scandal. Shimazaki was disowned by his brothers Hirosuke (who had tried to keep the affair a secret) and Hideo, and confronted with severe criticism from readers and fellow writers like Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. &quot;Shinsei&quot; was and is read by scholars in a variety of ways: as art for art&#x27;s sake, as a confession, as a way to provoke a rupture which he couldn&#x27;t bring about himself, as a means to get out in the open to preempt circulating rumours. Upon reading the novel, Komako tried to get the family&#x27;s agreement to marry Shimazaki, but instead the two were ultimately forbidden any further contact.

The alienation between the family members following the publication of &quot;Shinsei&quot; led to Shimazaki not even being informed of the death of his sister (and closest relative) Sono. He dramatised her last years, which she had spent mostly in medical institutions, in the 1921 novella &quot;The Life of a Certain Woman&quot;. &quot;Arashi&quot; (&quot;The tempest&quot;, 1926) chronicled his and his four children&#x27;s lives after the &quot;Shinsei&quot; scandal.

In 1928, Shimazaki married the more than twenty years younger Shizuko Katō, who had been assisting him on the short-lived feminist journal &quot;Shojochi&quot;. He published &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; (1929–1935), a historical novel about the Meiji Restoration from the point of view of a provincial activist in the Kokugaku (Nativism or National Learning) school of Atsutane Hirata. The hero, Aoyama Hanzō, is a thinly veiled representation of Shimazaki&#x27;s father Masaki. Similarly to the novel &quot;The Family&quot;, &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; is regarded as an outstanding effort by Shimazaki by literary scholars and has become his most popular novel.　Like the Aoyama family who fell in &quot;Before Dawn&quot;, there is a certificate for buying and selling land in Nakatsugawa City that he was in need of poverty in his later years and that he was selling the land and was planning money.

In 1935, Shimazaki became the first president of the newly established Japanese branch of International PEN. In 1936 he traveled to Buenos Aires to represent Japan at the International PEN Club meeting there, also visiting the United States and Europe on this voyage which lasted six months. In his notes, Shimazaki commented both on the West and its feeling of supremacy over the rest of the world, and the danger which lay in his own country&#x27;s aggressive nationalism: &quot;There is nothing more dangerous than underestimating the developing power of our nation, but at the same time, there is also nothing more dangerous than overestimating that power.&quot; The following year, he turned down the invitation to join the recently reorganised Imperial Academy of the Arts (Teikoku Geijutsuin) on the grounds of personal reasons.

In 1943, he began serialising a sequel to &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;, &quot;Tōhō no mon&quot; (&quot;The gate to the east&quot;), taking its title from a painting by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. Only two chapters were finished (with the second one published posthumously), as Shimazaki died of a stroke on the night of 21 to 22 August 1943 at the age of 71. His grave is at the Buddhist temple Jifuku-ji (地福寺) in Ōiso, Kanagawa Prefecture. In 1949, the Toson Memorial Museum was erected in his memory in his hometown Magome-juku.

<text>The Serbian Orthodox Church () is one of the autocephalous (ecclesiastically independent) Eastern Orthodox Christian churches.

The majority of the population in Serbia, Montenegro and Republika Srpska of Bosnia and Herzegovina are baptised members of the Serbian Orthodox Church. It is organized into metropolitanates and eparchies, located primarily in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Croatia. Other congregations are located in the Serb diaspora. The Serbian Patriarch serves as first among equals in his church. The current patriarch is Porfirije, enthroned on 19 February 2021.

The Church achieved autocephalous status in 1219, under the leadership of Saint Sava, becoming the independent Archbishopric of Žiča. Its status was elevated to that of a patriarchate in 1346, and was subsequently known as the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć. This patriarchate was abolished by the Ottoman Empire in 1766, though several regional sections of the church continued to exist, most prominent among them being the Metropolitanate of Karlovci, in the Habsburg monarchy. After the re-creation of Serbia, ecclesiastical autonomy was regained in 1831, and the autocephaly was renewed in 1879. The modern Serbian Orthodox Church was re-established in 1920, after the unification of the Metropolitanate of Belgrade, the Patriarchate of Karlovci, and the Metropolitanate of Montenegro.

==History==

===Early Christianity===
Christianity started to spread throughout the southeastern Europe during the 1st century. Early martyrs Florus and Laurus from the 2nd century, who were murdered along with other 300 Christians in Ulpiana, near modern Lipljan, are venerated as Christian saints. Bishop Irenaeus of Sirmium was also martyred, in 304. Emperor Constantine the Great (306–337), born in Naissus (modern Niš in Serbia), was the first Christian ruler of the Roman Empire. Several local bishops, seated in present-day Serbia, became prominent during the 4th century, such as Germinius of Sirmium, Ursacius of Singidunum and Secundianus of Singidunum (modern Belgrade), while several Councils were held in Sirmium.

In 395, the Empire was divided, and its eastern half later became known as the Byzantine Empire. In 535, emperor Justinian I created the Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima, centered in the emperor&#x27;s birth-city of Justiniana Prima, near modern Lebane in Serbia. The archbishopric had ecclesiastical jurisdiction over all provinces of the Diocese of Dacia. By the beginning of the 7th century, Byzantine provincial and ecclesiastical order in the region was destroyed by invading Avars and Slavs. The church life was renewed in the same century in the province of Illyricum and Dalmatia after a more pronounced Christianization of the Serbs and other Slavs by the Roman Church. In the 7th and mid-8th century the area was not under jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.

===Christianization of Serbs===

The history of the early medieval Serbian Principality is recorded in the work (), compiled by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus ( 913–959). The DAI drew information on the Serbs from, among others, a Serbian source. The Serbs were said to have received the protection of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641), and Porphyrogenitus stressed that the Serbs had always been under Imperial rule. According to De Administrando Imperio, the center from which the Serbs received their baptism was marked as Rome. His account on the first Christianization of the Serbs can be dated to 632–638; this might have been Porphyrogenitus&#x27; construction, or may have encompassed a limited group of chiefs, with lesser reception by the wider layers of the tribe. From the 7th until mid-9th century, the Serbs were under influence of the Roman Church. The initial ecclesiastical affiliation with a specific diocese is uncertain, probably was not an Adriatic centre. Early medieval Serbs are accounted as Christian by 870s, but it was a process that ended in the late 9th century during the time of Basil I, and medieval necropolises until the 13th century in the territory of modern Serbia show an &quot;incomplete process of Christianization&quot; as local Christianity depended on the social structure (urban and rural).

The expansion of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople over the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum is considered to have begun in 731 by Emperor Leo III when he annexed Sicily and Calabria, but whether the Patriarchate also expanded into the eastern parts of Illyricum and Dalmatia is uncertain and a matter of scholarly debate. The expansion most definitely happened since the mid-9th century, when the Byzantines emperors and patriarch demanded that the Church administrative borders follow political borders. In the same century, the region was also politically contested between the Carolingian Empire and Byzantine Empire. The most influential and successful was emperor Basil I, who actively worked on gaining control over all the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum (from Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian to Croatian Slavic peoples). Basil I likely sent at least one embassy to Mutimir of Serbia, who decided to maintain the communion of Church in Serbia with the Patriarchate of Constantinople when Pope John VIII invited him to get back to the jurisdiction of the bishopric of Sirmium (see also Archbishopric of Moravia) in a letter dated to May 873.

Alexis P. Vlasto argued that the Eparchy of Ras was founded during Mutimir&#x27;s rule, as a bishopric of Serbia, at Ras with the church of Saint Apostles Peter and Paul, as part of the general plan of establishing bishoprics in the Slav lands of the Empire, confirmed by the Council of Constantinople in 879–880, most significantly related to the creation of the autonomous Archbishopric for Bulgaria of which Roman Church lost jurisdiction. However, according to Predrag Komatina, there is no mention of any bishopric in Serbia. In early medieval Europe, the existence of a Christian church without a bishop in a specific land was not uncommon, and being placed under the Pannonian Bishop implies that there was no local Serbian bishop at the time. Tibor Živković concluded, based on primary sources of the Church of Constantinople, that there was no information regarding the establishment of any new ecclesiastical center and organization in Serbia, that the Serbian ecclesiastical center and capital was at Destinikon, while Ras in the mid-9th century was only a border fort which became the ecclesiastical center of the bishopric by 1019-1020. The imperial charter of Basil II from 1020 to the Archbishopric of Ohrid, in which the rights and jurisdictions were established, has the earliest mention of the Bishopric/Episcopy of Ras, stating it belonged to the Bulgarian autocephal church during the time of Peter I (927–969) and Samuel of Bulgaria (977–1014). It was of a small size. It is considered that it was possibly founded by the Bulgarian emperor, but most probably it represented the latest date in which it could have been integrated into the Bulgarian Church. The episcopy was probably part of the Bulgarian metropolis of Morava, but certainly not of Durrës. If it was on the Serbian territory, it seems that the Church in Serbia or part of the territory of Serbia became linked and influenced by the Bulgarian Church between 870 and 924.

With Christianization in the 9th century, Christian names appear among the members of Serbian dynasties (Petar, Stefan, Pavle, Zaharije). Prince Petar Gojniković (r. 892–917) was evidently a Christian ruler, and Christianity presumably was spreading in his time. Since Serbia bordered Bulgaria, Christian influences and perhaps missionaries came from there, increasing during the twenty-year peace. The Bulgarian annexation of Serbia in 924 was important for the future direction of the Serbian church. By then, at the latest, Serbia must have received the Cyrillic alphabet and Slavic religious text, already familiar but perhaps not yet preferred to Greek.

===Archbishopric of Ohrid (1018–1219)===

Following his final subjugation of the Bulgarian state in 1018, Basil II, to underscore the Byzantine victory, established the Archbishopric of Ohrid by downgrading the Bulgarian patriarchate to the rank of the archbishopric. The now archbishopric remained an autocephalous church, separate from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. However, while the archbishopric was completely independent in any other aspect, its primate was selected by the emperor from a list of three candidates submitted by the local church synod. In three &quot;sigillia&quot; issued in 1020 Basil II gave extensive privileges to the new see. In the first and third charter of Basil II was mentioned Bishopric of Serbia, while in the second charter of Basil II, dated 1020, the bishopric of Ras is mentioned, with the seat at the Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, Ras. 

The 10th- or 11th-century Gospel Book &quot;Codex Marianus&quot;, written in Old Church Slavonic in the Glagolithic script, is one of the oldest known Slavic manuscripts. It was partly written in the Serbian redaction of Old Church Slavonic. Other early manuscripts include the 11th-century &quot;Grškovićev odlomak Apostola&quot; and &quot;Mihanovićev odlomak&quot;.

===Autocephalous Archbishopric (1219–1346)===

Serbian prince Rastko Nemanjić, the son of Stefan Nemanja, took monastic vows at Mount Athos as &quot;Sava&quot; (Sabbas) in 1192. Three years later, his father joined him, taking monastic vows as &quot;Simeon&quot;. Father and son asked the Holy Community to found a Serbian religious centre at the abandoned site of Hilandar, which they renovated. This marked the beginning of a renaissance (in arts, literature and religion). Sava&#x27;s father died at Hilandar in 1199 and was canonized as St. Simeon. Saint Sava stayed for some years, rising in rank, then returned to Serbia in 1207, taking with him the remains of his father, which he interred at the Studenica monastery, after reconciling his two quarrelling brothers Stefan Nemanjić and Vukan. Stefan asked him to remain in Serbia with his clerics, which he did, providing widespread pastoral care and education to the people. Saint Sava founded several churches and monasteries, among them the Žiča monastery. In 1217, Stefan was proclaimed King of Serbia, and various questions of the church reorganization were opened.

Saint Sava returned to the Holy Mountain in 1217/18, preparing for the formation of an autocephalous Serbian Church. He was consecrated in 1219 as the first Archbishop of the Serbian Church, and was given autocephaly by Patriarch Manuel I of Constantinople, then in exile at Nicaea. In the same year, Saint Sava published &quot;Zakonopravilo&quot; (St. Sava&#x27;s Nomocanon). Thus the Serbs acquired both forms of independence: political and religious. After this, in Serbia, Sava stayed in Studenica and continued to educate the Serbian people in their faith. Later he called for a council outlawing the Bogomils, whom he considered heretics. Sava appointed several bishops, sending them around Serbia to organize their dioceses. To maintain his standing as the religious and social leader, he continued to travel among the monasteries and lands to educate the people. In 1221 a synod was held in the Žiča monastery, condemning Bogomilism.

The following seats were newly created in the time of Saint Sava:
* Žiča, the seat of the Archbishop at Monastery of Žiča;
* Eparchy of Zeta (&quot;Zetska&quot;), seated at Monastery of Holy Archangel Michael in Prevlaka near Kotor in Zeta region;
* Eparchy of Hum (&quot;Humska&quot;), seated at Monastery of the Holy Mother of God in Ston, in Hum region;
* Eparchy of Dabar (&quot;Dabarska&quot;), seated at Monastery of St. Nicholas in Dabar (region);
* Eparchy of Moravica (&quot;Moravička&quot;), seated at Monastery of St. Achillius in Moravica župa;
* Eparchy of Budimlja (&quot;Budimljanska&quot;), seated at Monastery of St. George in Budimlja region;
* Eparchy of Toplica (&quot;Toplička&quot;), seated at Monastery of St. Nicholas in Toplica region;
* Eparchy of Hvosno (&quot;Hvostanska&quot;), seated at Monastery of the Holy Mother of God in Hvosno region (northern Metohija).

Older eparchies under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Archbishop were:
* Eparchy of Ras (&quot;Raška&quot;), seated at Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul near Ras in Raška region;
* Eparchy of Lipljan (&quot;Lipljanska&quot;), seated at Lipljan in Kosovo;
* Eparchy of Prizren (&quot;Prizrenska&quot;), seated at Prizren in the south of Kosovo.

In 1229/1233, Saint Sava went on a pilgrimage to Palestine and in Jerusalem he met with Patriarch Athanasios II. Saint Sava saw Bethlehem where Jesus was born, the Jordan River where Christ was baptized, and the Great Lavra of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified (Mar Saba monastery). Sava asked Athanasios II, his host, and the Great Lavra fraternity, led by hegoumenos Nicolas, if he could purchase two monasteries in the Holy Land. His request was accepted and he was offered the monasteries of Saint John the Theologian on Mount Sion and St. George&#x27;s Monastery at Akona, both to be inhabited by Serbian monks. The icon Trojerucica (Three-handed Theotokos), a gift to the Great Lavra from St. John Damascene, was given to Saint Sava and he, in turn, bequeathed it to Hilandar.

Saint Sava died in Veliko Tarnovo, capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, during the reign of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. According to his &quot;Biography&quot;, he fell ill following the Divine Liturgy on the Feast of the Epiphany, 12 January 1235. Saint Sava was visiting Veliko Tarnovo on his way back from the Holy Land, where he had founded a hospice for Syrian pilgrims in Jerusalem and arranged for Serbian monks to be welcomed in the established monasteries there. He died of pneumonia in the night between Saturday and Sunday, 14 January 1235, and was buried at the Cathedral of the Holy Forty Martyrs in Veliko Tarnovo where his body remained until 6 May 1237, when his sacred bones were moved to the monastery Mileševa in southern Serbia.

In 1253 the see was transferred to the Monastery of Peć by archbishop Arsenije. The Serbian primates had since moved between the two. Sometime between 1276 and 1292 the Cumans burned the Žiča monastery, and King Stefan Milutin (1282–1321) renovated it in 1292–1309, during the office of Jevstatije II. In 1289–1290, the chief treasures of the ruined monastery, including the remains of Saint Jevstatije I, were transferred to Monastery of Peć. During the rule of the same king, the Monastery of Gračanica was also renewed, and during the reign of King Stefan Uroš III (1321–1331), the Monastery of Dečani was built, under the supervision of Archbishop Danilo II.

===Medieval Patriarchate (1346–1463)===

The status of the Serbian Orthodox Church grew along with the expansion and heightened prestige of the Serbian kingdom. After King Stefan Dušan assumed the imperial title of tsar, the Serbian Archbishopric was correspondingly raised to the rank of Patriarchate in 1346. In the century that followed, the Serbian Church achieved its greatest power and prestige. In the 14th century Serbian Orthodox clergy had the title of Protos at Mount Athos.

On 16 April 1346 (Easter), Stefan Dušan convoked a grand assembly at Skopje, attended by the Serbian Archbishop Joanikije II, Archbishop Nicholas I of Ohrid, Patriarch Simeon of Bulgaria and various religious leaders of Mount Athos. The assembly and clergy agreed on, and then ceremonially performed the raising of the autocephalous Serbian Archbishopric to the status of Patriarchate. The Archbishop was from now on titled &quot;Serbian Patriarch&quot;, although some documents called him &quot;Patriarch of Serbs and Greeks&quot;, with the seat at Patriarchal Monastery of Peć. The new Patriarch Joanikije II now solemnly crowned Stefan Dušan as &quot;Emperor and autocrat of Serbs and Romans&quot; (see Emperor of Serbs). The Patriarchal status resulted in raising bishoprics to metropolitanates, as for example the Metropolitanate of Skopje. The Patriarchate took over sovereignty on Mt. Athos and the Greek archbishoprics under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople (the Archbishopric of Ohrid remained autocephalous), which resulted in Dušan&#x27;s excommunication by Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople in 1350.

In 1375, an agreement between the Serbian Patriarchate and the Patriarchate of Constantinople was reached. The Battle of Kosovo (1389) and its aftermath had a lasting influence on medieval legacy and later traditions of the Serbian Orthodox Church. In 1455, when Ottoman Turks conquered the Patriarchal seat in Peć, Patriarch Arsenije II found temporary refuge in Smederevo, the capital city of Serbian Despotate.

Among cultural, artistic and literary legacies created under the auspices of the Serbian Orthodox Church during the medieval period were hagiographies, known in Serbian as &quot;žitije&quot; (vita), that were written as biographies of rulers, archbishops and saints from the 12th up to the 15th century.

===Renewed Patriarchate (1557–1766)===

The Ottoman Empire conquered the Serbian Despotate in 1459, the Bosnian Kingdom in 1463, Herzegovina in 1482 and Montenegro in 1499. All of the conquered lands were divided into sanjaks. Although some Serbs converted to Islam, most continued their adherence to the Serbian Orthodox Church. The church itself continued to exist throughout the Ottoman period, though not without some disruption. After the death of Serbian Patriarch Arsenije II in 1463, a successor was not elected. The Patriarchate was thus &quot;de facto&quot; abolished, and the Serbian Church passed under the jurisdiction of Archbishopric of Ohrid and ultimately the Ecumenical Patriarchate which exercised jurisdiction over all Orthodox of the Ottoman Empire under the &quot;millet&quot; system.

After several failed attempts, made from c. 1530 up to 1541 by metropolitan Pavle of Smederevo to regain the autocephaly by seizing the throne of Peć and proclaiming himself not only Archbishop of Peć, but also Serbian Patriarch, the Serbian Patriarchate was finally restored in 1557 under the Sultan Suleiman I, thanks to the mediation of pasha Mehmed Sokolović who was Serbian by birth. His cousin, one of the Serbian Orthodox bishops Makarije Sokolović was elected Patriarch in Peć. The restoration of the Patriarchate was of great importance for the Serbs because it helped the spiritual unification of all Serbs in the Ottoman Empire. The Patriarchate of Peć also included some dioceses in western Bulgaria.

In the time of Serbian Patriarch Jovan Kantul (1592–1614), the Ottoman Turks took the remains of Saint Sava from monastery Mileševa to the Vračar hill in Belgrade where they were burned by Sinan Pasha on a stake to intimidate the Serb people in case of revolts (see Banat Uprising) (1594). The Temple of Saint Sava was built on the place where his remains were burned.

After consequent Serbian uprisings against the Turkish occupiers in which the church had a leading role, the Ottomans abolished the Patriarchate once again in 1766. The church returned once more under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. This period of rule by the so-called &quot;Phanariots&quot; was a period of great spiritual decline because the Greek bishops had very little understanding of their Serbian flock.

===Church in the Habsburg Monarchy===

During this period, Christians across the Balkans were under pressure to convert to Islam to avoid severe taxes imposed by the Turks in retaliation for uprisings and continued resistance. The success of Islamization was limited to certain areas, with the majority of the Serbian population keeping its Christian faith despite the negative consequences. To avoid them, numerous Serbs migrated with their hierarchs to the Habsburg monarchy where their autonomy had been granted. In 1708, an autonomous Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Karlovci was created, which would later become a patriarchate (1848–1920).

During the reign of Maria Theresa (1740-1780), several assemblies of Orthodox Serbs were held, sending their petitions to the Habsburg court. In response to that, several royal acts were issued, such as &quot;Regulamentum privilegiorum&quot; (1770) and &quot;Regulamentum Illyricae Nationis&quot; (1777), both of them replaced by the royal Declaratory Rescript of 1779, that regulated various important questions, from the procedure regarding the elections of Serbian Orthodox bishops in the Habsburg Monarchy, to the management of dioceses, parishes and monasteries. The act was upheld in force until it was replaced by the &quot;Royal Rescript&quot; issued on 10 August 1868.

===Modern history===
The church&#x27;s close association with Serbian resistance to Ottoman rule led to Eastern Orthodoxy becoming inextricably linked with Serbian national identity and the new Serbian monarchy that emerged from 1815 onwards. The Serbian Orthodox Church in the Principality of Serbia gained its autonomy in 1831 and was organized as the Metropolitanate of Belgrade, remaining under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Principality of Serbia gained full political independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, and soon after those negotiations were initiated with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, resulting in canonical recognition of full ecclesiastical independence (autocephaly) for the Metropolitanate of Belgrade in 1879.

At the same time, Serbian Orthodox eparchies in Bosnia and Herzegovina remained under the supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but after the Austro-Hungarian occupation (1878) of those provinces, local eparchies gained internal autonomy, regulated by the Convention of 1880, signed by representatives of Austro-Hungarian authorities and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.

In the southern eparchies, that remained under the Ottoman rule, Serbian metropolitans were appointed by the end of the 19th century. Thus, by the beginning of the 20th century, several distinctive Serbian ecclesiastical provinces existed, including the Patriarchate of Karlovci in the Habsburg monarchy, the Metropolitanate of Belgrade in the Kingdom of Serbia, and the Metropolitanate of Montenegro in the Principality of Montenegro (Kingdom of Montenegro after 1910).

During World War I (1914–1918), the Serbian Orthodox Church suffered massive casualties.

====Reunification====
After the liberation and political unification, that was achieved by creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1918), all Eastern Orthodox Serbs were united under one ecclesiastical authority, and all Serbian ecclesiastical provinces and eparchies were united into the single Serbian Orthodox Church, in 1920. The first primate of the united SOC was Serbian Patriarch Dimitrije (1920–1930). The SOC gained great political and social influence in the inter-war Kingdom of Yugoslavia, during which time it successfully campaigned against the Yugoslav government&#x27;s intentions of signing a concordat with the Holy See.

The united Serbian Orthodox Church kept under its jurisdiction the Eparchy of Buda in Hungary. In 1921, the Serbian Orthodox Church created a new eparchy for the Czech lands, headed by bishop Gorazd Pavlik. At the same time, the Serbian Church among the diaspora was reorganized, and the eparchy (diocese) for the United States and Canada was created. In 1931 another diocese was created, called the Eparchy of Mukačevo and Prešov, for the Eastern Orthodox Christians in Slovakia and Carpathian Rusynia.

During the Second World War the Serbian Orthodox Church suffered severely from persecutions by the occupying powers and the rabidly anti-Serbian Ustaše regime of Independent State of Croatia (NDH), which sought to create a &quot;Croatian Orthodox Church&quot; which Orthodox Serbs were forced to join. Many Serbs were killed, expelled or forced to convert to Catholicism during the Serbian Genocide; bishops and priests of the Serbian Orthodox Church were singled out for persecution, and many Orthodox churches were damaged or destroyed. Out of the 577 Serbian Orthodox priests, monks and other religious dignitaries in the NDH, between 214 and 217 were killed and 334 were exiled to German-occupied Serbia. Some of them were brutally tortured and mutilated by the Ustaše prior to being killed. In the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 71 Orthodox priests were killed by the Ustaše, 10 by the Partisans, 5 by the Germans, and 45 died in the first decade after the end of WWII.

====Under communist rule====
After the war, the church was suppressed by the communist government of Josip Broz Tito, which viewed it with suspicion due to the church&#x27;s links with the leadership from the period of Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the nationalist Chetnik movement. According to Denis Bećirović, aside from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia&#x27;s ideological differences with the Church, this negative attitude was also influenced by the fact that some priests during the war supported the Chetnik movement which are mentioned in Documents of the Commission for Religious Affairs where is stated that among other things, that the majority of priests during the war supported and cooperated with the movement of Draža Mihailović, and that the church spread &quot;hostile propaganda&quot; against the Yugoslav Partisans and appointed persons in the administration of church institutions who were convicted of collaborating with the occupier. Along with other ecclesiastical institutions of all denominations, the church was subject to strict controls by the Yugoslav state, which prohibited the teaching of religion in schools, confiscated church property and discouraged religious activity among the population.

In 1963, the Serbian Church among the diaspora was reorganized, and the eparchy for the United States and Canada was divided into three separate eparchies. At the same time, some internal divisions sparked in the Serbian diaspora, leading to the creation of the separate &quot;Free Serbian Orthodox Church&quot; under Bishop Dionisije. Division was healed in 1991, and Metropolitanate of New Gračanica was created, within the united Serbian Orthodox Church. In 1983, a fourth eparchy in North America was created specifically for Canadian churches: the Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Canada.

The gradual demise of Yugoslav communism and the rise of rival nationalist movements during the 1980s also led to a marked religious revival throughout Yugoslavia, not least in Serbia. The Serbian Patriarch Pavle supported the opposition to Slobodan Milošević in the 1990s.

Since the establishment of the Yugoslav federal unit of &quot;Macedonia&quot; (1944), communist authorities restricted the activities of SOC in that region, favoring the creation of a separate church. The Macedonian Orthodox Church was created in 1967, effectively as an offshoot of the Serbian Orthodox Church in what was then the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, as part of the Yugoslav drive to build up a Macedonian national identity. This was strongly resisted by the Serbian Church, which did not recognize the independence of its Macedonian counterpart.

Similar plans for the creation of an independent church in the Yugoslav federal unit of Montenegro were also considered, but those plans were not put into action before 1993, when the creation of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church was proclaimed. The organization was not legally registered before 2000, receiving no support from the Eastern Orthodox communion, and succeeding to attract only a minority of Eastern Orthodox adherents in Montenegro.

====Recent history====
The Yugoslav wars greatly impacted the Serbian Orthodox Church. During this time, the church was embroiled during Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s policies and the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo.

Many churches in Croatia were damaged or destroyed during the war in Croatia (1991–95). The bishops and priests and most faithful of the eparchies of Zagreb, of Karlovac, of Slavonia and of Dalmatia became refugees. The latter three were almost completely abandoned after the exodus of the Serbs from Croatia in 1995 (Operation Storm). The eparchy of Dalmatia also had its see temporarily moved to Knin after the self-proclaimed proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina was established. The eparchy of Slavonia had its see moved from Pakrac to Daruvar. After Operation Storm, the Krupa monastery was particularly damaged and the Krka monastery was looted.

The eparchies of Bihać and Petrovac, Dabar-Bosnia and Zvornik and Tuzla were also dislocated due to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The eparchy see of Dabar-Bosnia was temporarily moved to Sokolac, and the see of Zvornik-Tuzla to Bijeljina. Over a hundred Church-owned objects in the Zvornik-Tuzla eparchy were destroyed or damaged during the war. Many monasteries and churches in the Zahumlje eparchy were also destroyed. Numerous faithful from these eparchies also became refugees.

By 1998, the situation had stabilized in both countries. The clergy and many of the faithful returned; most of the property of the Serbian Orthodox Church was returned to normal use and damaged and destroyed properties were restored. The process of rebuilding several churches is still underway, notably the cathedral of the Eparchy of Upper Karlovac in Karlovac.

Owing to the Kosovo War, after 1999 numerous Serbian Orthodox holy sites in Kosovo left occupied only by clergy. Since the arrival of NATO troops in June 1999, 156 Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries have been damaged or destroyed. In the aftermath of the 2004 unrest in Kosovo, 35 Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries were burned or destroyed by Albanian mobs, and thousands of Serbs were forced to move from Kosovo due to the numerous attacks of Kosovo Albanians on Serbian churches and Serbs.

The process of church reorganization among the diaspora and full reintegration of the Metropolitanate of New Gračanica was completed from 2009 to 2011. By that, full structural unity of Serbian church institutions in the diaspora was achieved.

==Adherents==
Based on the official census results in countries that encompass the territorial canonical jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church (the Serb autochthonous region of Western Balkans), there are more than 8 million adherents of the church. Orthodoxy is the largest single religious faith in Serbia with 5,387,426 adherents (81% of the population) according to the 2022 census, and in Montenegro with around 320,000 (51% of the population). It is the second-largest faith in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 31.2% of the population, and in Croatia with 4.4% of the population. Figures for eparchies abroad (Western Europe, North America, and Australia) are unknown although some estimates can be reached based on the size of the Serb diaspora, which numbers over two million people.

==Structure==
The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the patriarch, also serves as the head (metropolitan) of the Metropolitanate of Belgrade and Karlovci. The current patriarch, Porfirije, was inaugurated on 19 February 2021. Serbian Orthodox patriarchs use the style &quot;His Holiness the Archbishop of Peć, Metropolitan of Belgrade and Karlovci, Serbian Patriarch&quot;.

The highest body of the Serbian Orthodox Church is the Bishops&#x27; Council. It consists of the Patriarch, the Metropolitans, Bishops, and Vicar Bishops. It meets annually – in spring. The Bishops&#x27; Council makes important decisions for the church and elects the patriarch.

The executive body of the Serbian Orthodox Church is the Holy Synod. It has five members: four bishops and the patriarch.
The Holy Synod takes care of the everyday operation of the church, holding meetings on regular basis.
===Territorial organisation===

The territory of the Serbian Orthodox Church is divided into:
* 1 patriarchal eparchy, headed by the Serbian Patriarch
* 4 eparchies that are honorary metropolitanates, headed by metropolitans
* 35 eparchies (&quot;dioceses&quot;), headed by bishops

Dioceses are further divided into episcopal deaneries, each consisting of several church congregations or parishes. Church congregations consist of one or more parishes. A parish is the smallest church unit – a communion of Orthodox faithful congregating at the Holy Eucharist with the parish priest at their head.

====Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric====
The Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric was an autonomous archbishopric in North Macedonia under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church. It was formed in 2002 in opposition to the Macedonian Orthodox Church, and was dissolved in 2023. The Macedonian Orthodox Church had had a similar relationship with the Serbian Orthodox Church prior to 1967 when it unilaterally declared itself autocephalous. This archbishopric was divided into one metropolitanate, Skopje, and the six eparchies of Bregalnica, Debar and Kičevo, Polog and Kumanovo, Prespa and Pelagonija, Strumica and Veles and Povardarje.

==Doctrine and liturgy==
The Serbian Orthodox Church upholds the Eastern Orthodox theology, shared by all Eastern Orthodox Churches and based on doctrinal accomplishments of the Seven Ecumenical Councils. It is characterized by monotheistic Trinitarianism, a belief in the Incarnation of the Logos (Son of God), a balancing of cataphatic theology with apophatic theology, a hermeneutic defined by Sacred Tradition, and a therapeutic soteriology. In the fields of Church organization and administration, Serbian Orthodox Church upholds traditions and principles of Eastern Orthodox ecclesiology.

Liturgical traditions and practices of the Serbian Orthodox Church are based on the Eastern Orthodox worship. Services cannot properly be conducted by a single person but must have at least one other person present. Usually, all of the services are conducted on a daily basis only in monasteries and cathedrals, while parish churches might only do the services on the weekend and major feast days. The Divine Liturgy is the celebration of the Eucharist. The Divine Liturgy is not celebrated on weekdays during the preparatory season of Great Lent. Communion is consecrated on Sundays and distributed during the week at the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts. Services, especially the Divine Liturgy, can only be performed once a day on any particular altar.

A key part of the Serbian Orthodox religion is the Slava, a celebration of the Clan Patron Saint, placed into the Serb Orthodox religious canon by the first Serb archbishop Saint Sava.

===Social issues===
The Serbian Orthodox Church upholds traditional views on modern social issues, such as separation of church and state (imposed since the abolition of monarchy in 1945), and social equality. Since all forms of priesthood are reserved only for men, the role of women in church administration is limited to specific activities, mainly in the fields of religious education and religious arts, including the participation in various forms of charity work.

===Inter-Christian relations===
The Serbian Orthodox Church is in full communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (which holds a special place of honour within Eastern Orthodoxy and serves as the seat for the Ecumenical Patriarch, who enjoys the status of &quot;first-among-equals&quot;) and all of the mainstream autocephalous Eastern Orthodox church bodies except the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. It has been a member of the World Council of Churches since 1965, with Patriarch German even being elected to its central committee in 1968, as well as of the Conference of European Churches.

==Art==
===Architecture===

Serbian medieval churches were built in the Byzantine spirit. The Raška style refers to the Serbian architecture from the 12th to the end of the 14th century (Studenica, Hilandar, Žiča). The Vardar style, which is the typical one, was developed in the late 13th century combining Byzantine and Serbian influences to form a new architectural style (Gračanica, Patriarchal Monastery of Peć). By the time of the Serbian Empire, the Serbian state had enlarged itself over Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly all the way to the Aegean Sea, which resulted in stronger influences from Byzantine art tradition. The Morava style refers to the period of the fall of Serbia under the Ottoman Empire, from 1371 to 1459 (Ravanica, Ljubostinja, Kalenić, Resava).

During the 17th-century, many of the Serbian Orthodox churches that were built in Belgrade took all the characteristics of baroque churches built in the Habsburg-occupied regions where Serbs lived. The churches usually had a bell tower, and a single nave building with the iconostasis inside the church covered with Renaissance-style paintings. These churches can be found in Belgrade and Vojvodina, which were occupied by the Austrian Empire from 1717 to 1739, and on the border with Austrian (later Austria-Hungary) across the Sava and Danube rivers from 1804 when Serbian statehood was re-established.

===Icons===

Icons are replete with symbolism meant to convey far more meaning than simply the identity of the person depicted, and it is for this reason that Orthodox iconography has become an exacting science of copying older icons rather than an opportunity for artistic expression. The personal, idiosyncratic and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Orthodox iconography before the 17th century, when Russian and Serbian icon painting was influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Europe.

Large icons can be found adorning the walls of churches and often cover the inside structure completely. Orthodox homes often likewise have icons hanging on the wall, usually together on an eastern facing wall, and in a central location where the family can pray together.

==Insignia==

The Serbian tricolour with a Serbian cross is used as the official flag of the Serbian Orthodox Church, as defined in the Article 4 of the SOC Constitution.

A number of other unofficial variant flags, some with variations of the cross, coat of arms, or both, exist.

<text>Cao Rui () (204 or 205 – 22 January 239), courtesy name Yuanzhong, was the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. His parentage is in dispute: his mother, Lady Zhen, was Yuan Xi&#x27;s wife, but she later remarried Cao Pi, the first ruler of Wei. Based on conflicting accounts of his age, Pei Songzhi calculated that, in order to be Cao Pi&#x27;s son, Cao Rui could not have been 36 (by East Asian age reckoning) when he died as recorded, so the recorded age was in error; late-Qing scholars Lu Bi (卢弼) and Mao Guangsheng (冒广生) argued instead that Cao Rui was Yuan Xi&#x27;s son.

Cao Rui&#x27;s reign was viewed in many different ways throughout Chinese history. He devoted many resources into building palaces and ancestral temples, and his reign saw the stalemate between his empire, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu become more entrenched. His building projects and his desire to have many concubines (who numbered in the thousands) greatly exhausted the imperial treasury.

On his deathbed, he had no biological son. He passed the throne to his adopted son Cao Fang and entrusted him to the regency of Cao Shuang and Sima Yi. This would prove to be a fatal mistake for his clan, as Cao Shuang monopolised power and governed incompetently, eventually drawing a violent reaction from Sima Yi, who overthrew him in a coup d&#x27;état (Incident at the Gaoping Tombs). Sima Yi became in control of the Wei government from February 249, eventually allowing his grandson Sima Yan to usurp the throne in February 266. After his death, Cao Rui was posthumously honoured as &quot;Emperor Ming&quot; with the temple name &quot;Liezu&quot;.

==Family background==
When Cao Rui was born (likely in 205), his grandfather Cao Cao was the paramount warlord of the Han dynasty, who had rendered Emperor Xian of Han a mere figurehead. His father Cao Pi was Cao Cao&#x27;s oldest surviving son and the heir apparent. His mother Lady Zhen had been the wife of Yuan Shao&#x27;s son Yuan Xi, but when she was seized by Cao Cao&#x27;s army in September or October 204, Cao Pi forced her to marry him, and she gave birth to Cao Rui only eight months after the wedding—leading to theories that Cao Rui was actually biologically Yuan Xi&#x27;s son and not Cao Pi&#x27;s. However, Cao Cao was fond of this grandson, and frequently ordered Rui to be at his side. Cao Cao even said, &quot;It is because of you (Cao Rui) that my achievements can last three generations.&quot; Cao Pi, after his father&#x27;s death in March 220, forced Emperor Xian to yield the throne to him and established Cao Wei in December of that year. Lady Zhen was not allowed to accompany him to the new capital Luoyang; in August 221, he forced her to commit suicide.

Because of what happened to Lady Zhen and Cao Rui&#x27;s unclear origin, even though Cao Rui was the oldest of Cao Pi&#x27;s sons, he was not created crown prince early in his father&#x27;s reign, but was only created the Prince of Pingyuan in March 222. Sometime during his years as the Prince of Pingyuan, he married a daughter of an aristocrat, Lady Yu, as his wife and princess. He apparently had a cordial relationship with Lady Guo, who was created empress (in October 222), and as she was sonless, his status as heir apparent was not seriously challenged. It is said that any thoughts that Cao Pi had at not making him heir was dissipated by a hunt; during that hunt, Cao Pi and Cao Rui had encountered a mother deer and a young deer. Cao Pi killed the mother deer with an arrow, and then ordered Cao Rui to kill the young deer. Cao Rui wept and said, &quot;Your imperial majesty had already killed the mother, and I do not have the heart to kill the son as well.&quot; Cao Pi dropped his bow and arrows and became mournful.

In June 226, when Cao Pi became ill, he finally created Cao Rui crown prince. He died soon thereafter, and Cao Rui became emperor at the age of 21.

==As emperor==
Cao Rui&#x27;s reign was a paradoxical one in many ways. He was clearly intelligent and capable, and yet never fulfilled his potential in his governance of the country or in his military campaigns. He showed great compassion at times, and yet was capable of great cruelty. He carried out many acts that were beneficial for the empire and yet at least as many that were hurtful. Despite his uncle Cao Zhi&#x27;s successive petitions, however, he continued the severe prohibitions against princes&#x27; holding of offices that his father Cao Pi had put in place, and this was commonly viewed by traditional historians as an eventual factor in the downfall of Cao Wei, as the Simas took power after Cao Rui&#x27;s death without the imperial princes having any real ability to oppose them.

===Treatment of officials===
Cao Rui, a young adult when he became emperor, quickly showed a knack for finding capable officials to empower while maintaining steady control over them. His father had appointed three regents for him—his distant cousin Cao Zhen, the steady administrator Chen Qun, and the shrewd strategist Sima Yi. Once Cao Rui became emperor, however, he, while knowing the value of the advice of these senior officials, chose perhaps the best path to deal with them: honoring them and making them regional governors with full authority in the provinces they governed. By doing this, he showed that he was his own man while at the same time continued to receive the wisdom of their advice.

Throughout Cao Rui&#x27;s reign, he showed great diligence in seeking out advice from multiple officials, rather than concentrating on listening to several, before making important decisions. He was generally cautious and not willing to take risks, but at the same time was, therefore, able to avoid major disasters for his empire.

===Campaigns against Shu Han===

One immediate threat that Cao Rui had to deal with after he became emperor were attacks from Shu Han&#x27;s chancellor, Zhuge Liang. Zhuge had, after the death of Shu Han&#x27;s founding emperor, Liu Bei, initially taken a passive posture militarily with regards to the Shu Han-Cao Wei border, while re-establishing an alliance with Sun Quan&#x27;s Eastern Wu, in order to rest the people and the troops. In 227, he, under the theory that Shu Han was naturally a weaker state than Cao Wei and, if it had just sat and done nothing, would eventually be swallowed up by Cao Wei anyway, started a series of five northern campaigns.

During these campaigns, Cao Rui&#x27;s response generally was to head to the metropolitan Chang&#x27;an—a politically important city that Wei could not afford to lose—and then commission generals to the frontlines to ward off Zhuge&#x27;s attacks. This strategy had the effect of boosting the morale of the troops and shortening the communication line. Being fairly quickly updated as to the events at the frontlines, Cao Rui could also keep the central empire under his watch. Ultimately, Zhuge&#x27;s campaigns were futile; after his death in 234, his plan was largely abandoned by his successors Jiang Wan and Fei Yi. However, that did not mean that there was peace on the borders with Shu Han, as nearly every year, there would be battles between the two states. However, there would be no major confrontations on the scale of Zhuge&#x27;s campaigns for the rest of Cao Rui&#x27;s reign.

===Campaigns against Eastern Wu===
During Cao Rui&#x27;s reign, there were also many battles waged against the other rival empire, Eastern Wu. The very first came only two months after Cao Rui had become emperor in June 226. It was during that campaign that Cao Rui showed his acumen for judging a situation correctly—believing that by the time that reinforcements could be sent, Eastern Wu&#x27;s monarch Sun Quan would have already withdrawn, and therefore sending reinforcements was pointless. Throughout his reign, he would generally take a similar stance during campaigns against Eastern Wu as he did with Shu Han—head east personally to be close to the theater of the war, while remaining some distance away from the frontlines, which also proved to be effective. He also entrusted the southeastern border to the capable Man Chong, and Man&#x27;s stewardship averted many disasters.

Cao Rui&#x27;s greatest military loss came in 228, when the Eastern Wu general Zhou Fang tricked Cao Rui&#x27;s distant cousin and regional governor Cao Xiu into believing that he was ready to surrender his troops to Cao Wei, while instead laying a trap for Cao Xiu. Instead of realizing that it was indeed a trap, Cao Rui enthusiastically approved Cao Xiu&#x27;s plan, and this led to a major military disaster, but Cao Xiu&#x27;s forces were saved by Jia Kui from total annihilation.

Another serious crisis posed by Eastern Wu occurred in 234, when Eastern Wu, in a semi-coordinated effort with Shu Han, launched an attack against Cao Wei simultaneously with Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Northern Expeditions. At the time, many frontline officials were on vacation visiting families, so Man Chong requested Cao Rui to call them back to fight Sun Quan. Cao Rui refused to cancel his subordinates&#x27; vacation, and ordered Man to focus on the defense. Cao Rui then personally led the royal army as reinforcement, and acted as an effective coordinator of the various forces that Cao Wei had on Eastern Wu&#x27;s borders, and Eastern Wu was unable to make substantial gains.

===Campaigns against Liaodong===

The only real military gain for Cao Wei during Cao Rui&#x27;s reign was the end of the Gongsun clan&#x27;s hold on Liaodong (modern central and eastern Liaoning), which was started by Gongsun Du in 190. In 228, Gongsun Du&#x27;s grandson Gongsun Yuan deposed his uncle Gongsun Gong in a coup and asked for an official commission from Cao Rui. Acting against Liu Ye ()&#x27;s advice to attack the Gongsuns while there was dissension within, Cao Rui instead gave Gongsun Yuan an official commission as governor of Liaodong Commandery.

In 232, Gongsun Yuan&#x27;s repeated communicated with and sales of horses to Eastern Wu angered Cao Rui, who ordered his generals Tian Yu and Wang Xiong () to attack Liaodong against Jiang Ji ()&#x27;s advice; the attacks were not successful, although Tian was able to intercept the Eastern Wu horse-buying fleet and destroy it. After the incident, although Gongsun formally maintained vassalage to Cao Wei, the relationship was damaged.

The next year saw that relationship would be somewhat improved. Gongsun, apprehensive of another attack from Cao Wei, sent ambassadors to Eastern Wu to formally submit to its emperor Sun Quan. Sun was so pleased that he immediately created Gongsun the Prince of Yan and granted him the nine bestowments, which were typically reserved for officials so powerful that the bestowments were typically viewed as a sign that the emperor was about to abdicate to them. However, Gongsun realized later that Eastern Wu would be of little help in an expedition against him. He betrayed Eastern Wu, slaughtered Sun&#x27;s ambassadors as they arrived in Liaodong, and seized their troops. In response, Cao Rui created Gongsun the Duke of Lelang. (Part of the Eastern Wu troops were able to escape and eventually returned home with the assistance of Goguryeo, a rival of the Gongsuns.)

In 237, Cao Rui once again considered attacking Liaodong, angered by reports that Gongsun had repeatedly defamed him. He commissioned Guanqiu Jian to prepare for an attack, and then ordered Gongsun to come to Luoyang for an official visit. Gongsun refused and instead declared independence. Guanqiu attacked him, but was stopped by torrential rains. Gongsun then declared himself the Prince of Yan and entered into alliances with the Xianbei tribes to harass Cao Wei&#x27;s borders.

The following year, Cao Rui sent Sima Yi with 40,000 men to attack Liaodong. Upon hearing this, Gongsun again requested aid from Eastern Wu. Sun, angry at Gongsun&#x27;s previous betrayal, pretended to agree, but did not send Gongsun any actual help. Although Sima&#x27;s expeditionary force was also initially halted by torrential rains as Guanqiu&#x27;s was, Sima waited out the rains and eventually surrounded Gongsun&#x27;s capital of Xiangping (襄平, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning), starving Gongsun&#x27;s troops. After nearly three months of siege, Xiangping fell, and Gongsun fled, but was captured and executed by Sima. Liaodong became part of Cao Wei&#x27;s domain.

===Building projects and collection of concubines===
Almost immediately after Cao Rui ascended the throne, he started out large scale palace and temple-building projects. Part of it was to be expected—the Luoyang palaces had been remnants of the ones not destroyed by Dong Zhuo, and the temples were needed for the cults of his ancestors. However, he went beyond the minimally required, and continued to build temples and palaces throughout the rest of his reign, severely draining the imperial treasury. While he occasionally halted projects at the officials&#x27; behest, the projects would restart after brief breaks. He not only built palaces in Luoyang, but also built a palace in Xuchang. In 237, he further moved many of the magnificent statues and monuments that were commissioned by Emperor Wu of Han from Chang&#x27;an to Luoyang, costing great expenses and lives. He further built gigantic bronze statues of his own and placed them on a man-made hill inside his palace, surrounded by rare trees and plants and populated by rare animals.

Cao Rui was also increasing his collection of women, as his concubines and ladies in waiting numbered thousands. His palace-building projects might have been with intent to house them. The contemporary historian Yu Huan recorded that in 237, Cao Rui even ordered that beautiful married women all be formally seized unless their husbands were able to ransom them, and that they would be married to soldiers instead—but that the most beautiful among them would become his concubines. Despite some officials&#x27; (including Zhang Mao&#x27;s) protestations, this decree was apparently carried out, much to the distress of his people.

===Marriages, succession issues and death===
When Cao Rui became emperor, it was commonly expected that his wife, Princess Yu, would be created empress, but she was not. Rather, he created a favorite concubine, Consort Mao, empress in late 227. Princess Yu was exiled back to their original palace. He loved Empress Mao dearly, and a number of her relatives, including her father and brother, became honored officials (but without actual powers).

Despite his collection of women, however, Cao Rui was without any son who survived infancy. He adopted two sons to be his own—Cao Fang and Cao Xun, whom he created princes on 23 September 235. (It is usually accepted that they were sons of his cousins, although the exact parentage is not clear.) In June or July 237, Cao Rui took the unprecedented (and unrepeated in Chinese history) action of setting his own temple name of &quot;Liezu&quot;, while setting the temple names of Cao Cao and Cao Pi. He also ordered that the temples of Cao Cao, Cao Pi and himself were not to be torn down in the future. (Based on Confucian regulations, except for the founder of the dynasty, rulers&#x27; temples would be destroyed after six generations.) He carried out these actions apparently in apprehension that he would be given an unflattering temple name (or none at all) and that his temple would eventually be destroyed, due to his lack of biological issue and unclear origin.

By 237, Cao Rui&#x27;s favorite was no longer Empress Mao, but Consort Guo. In September that year, when Cao Rui was attending a feast hosted by Consort Guo, Consort Guo requested that Empress Mao be invited to join as well, but Cao Rui refused and further ordered that no news about the feast is to be given to Empress Mao. However, the news leaked, and Empress Mao talked about the feast with him anyway. He became exceedingly angry, and killed a number of his attendants whom he suspected of leaking the news to Empress Mao, and, inexplicably, ordered Empress Mao to commit suicide, even though she was still buried with honors due an empress, and her family remained honored.

On 31 December 238, Cao Rui grew ill. He created Consort Guo empress on 16 January 239 in preparation of allowing her to become empress dowager after his death. He initially wanted to entrust his adopted son, Cao Fang the Prince of Qi, to his uncle Cao Yu, to serve as the lead regent, along with Xiahou Xian (), Cao Shuang, Cao Zhao (), and Qin Lang (). However, his trusted officials Liu Fang () and Sun Zi () were unfriendly with Xiahou and Cao Zhao and were apprehensive about their becoming regents, and managed to persuade him to make Cao Shuang (with whom they were friendly) and Sima Yi regents instead. Cao Yu, Cao Zhao, and Qin were excluded from the regency. On 22 January 239, Cao Rui created the seven-year-old Cao Fang crown prince, and died that same day. Cao Fang succeeded him as emperor. On 17 February, Cao Rui was buried at Gaoping Tombs.

===Oddities regarding traditions and customs=== 
Even before his setting of his own temple name, Cao Rui was recorded to be involved in odd behaviour in events regarding the traditions and customs of his day.
On 3 August 229, Cao Teng was posthumously honoured as &quot;Emperor Gao of Wei&quot; (), becoming the only eunuch in Chinese officialdom to have this honor.

When Cao Rui&#x27;s daughter Cao Shu (曹淑) died in infancy (less than one month old) on 15 February 232, Cao Rui insisted in joining the funeral procession. Yang Fu noted that he did not do so during the funerals of Cao Pi and Empress Dowager Bian, and advised him not to join in the funeral procession. Cao Rui ignored Yang&#x27;s advice. Cao Rui also insisted that the funeral rites used be those for an adult woman and that court officials were to don mourning clothing; Chen Qun wrote a formal submission to advise the emperor. Cao Rui ignored the advice. Afterwards, besides bestowing upon Cao Shu the posthumous title of &quot;Princess Yi of Pingyuan&quot;, Cao Rui ordered that a temple be raised for her. A deceased grandson of his mother Lady Zhen&#x27;s brother, Zhen Huang (甄黄), was also buried with Cao Shu and was posthumously made a marquis. A male relative of Empress Mingyuan, Guo De (郭德), was declared to be the deceased couple&#x27;s child; his surname was changed to &quot;Zhen&quot; and he was made Marquis of Pingyuan, inheriting the princess&#x27;s title.

===Changes to the calendar during the &quot;Jing&#x27;chu&quot; era===
In February 237, after receiving reports of auspicious signs, Cao Rui agreed to make changes to the calendar, such that the &quot;jian&#x27;chou&quot; month (the 12th month) became the new &quot;zheng&quot; month (and thus the start of a new year). This calendar change took effect after 11 April 237 in the Julian calendar, along with the change in era name from &quot;Qing&#x27;long&quot; to &quot;Jing&#x27;chu&quot;.

After Cao Rui&#x27;s death, his successor Cao Fang reverted the changes, and the &quot;jian&#x27;yin&quot; month (the 1st month) once again became the &quot;zheng&quot; month, and thus the start of a new year.

<text>Breakaway roping is a variation of calf roping where a calf is roped, but not thrown and tied. It is a rodeo event that features a calf and one mounted rider. The calves are moved one at a time through narrow runs leading to a chute with spring-loaded doors. The horse and rider wait in a box next to the chute that has a spring-loaded rope, known as the barrier, stretched in front. A light rope is fastened from the chute to the calf&#x27;s neck, releasing once the calf is well away from the chute and releasing the barrier, which is used to ensure that the calf gets a head start. Once the barrier has released, the horse runs out of the box while the roper attempts to throw a lasso around the neck of the calf.

Once the rope is around the calf&#x27;s neck, the roper signals the horse to stop suddenly. The rope is tied to the saddle horn with a string. When the calf hits the end of the rope, the rope is pulled tight and the string breaks. The breaking of the string marks the end of the run. The rope usually has a small white flag at the end that makes the moment the rope breaks more easily seen by the timer. The fastest run wins.

The most common penalty in breakaway roping is the 10 seconds added when a roper breaks the barrier, failing to give the calf the appropriate head start. Breakaway ropes may also be flagged out (disqualified) for any catch other than a bell-collar catch—that is, a clean catch around the calf&#x27;s neck.

At the collegiate, semi-professional, and professional levels, breakaway roping is exclusively a women&#x27;s event, but at the junior and high school levels, competitors can be both male and female. Some amateur rodeos also have breakaway roping as part of their event line-up. It is also used as a substitute for calf roping in some parts of Europe, where traditional calf roping, also called tie-down roping, is banned.

In 2019, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) started including Women&#x27;s Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) sanctioned breakaway roping at some of their events, making it along with the standard WPRA barrel racing the two rodeo events for women. Since 2020, the year-end National Finals Breakaway Roping (NFBR) has been held to determine the WPRA World Champion breakaway roper. This event is held in conjunction with the PRCA&#x27;s National Finals Rodeo (NFR). As of 2024, breakaway roping is held in approximately 500 PRCA rodeos.

<text>Alton Jay Rubin (February 10, 1932 – August 26, 1993), who performed as Rockin&#x27; Dopsie (sometimes Rockin&#x27; Dupsee), was an American zydeco singer and accordion player who had success first in Europe and later in the United States. He played accordion on &quot;That Was Your Mother&quot; on Paul Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Graceland&quot; (1986).

==Biography==
He was born in Carencro, Louisiana, the son of Walter Rubin, who played accordion at local dances. Alton Rubin&#x27;s first language was Louisiana Creole French. He was given his first accordion at the age of 14, and, being left-handed, learned to play it upside down. He began performing at local parties, and soon outstripped his father&#x27;s abilities. He moved with his parents to Lafayette, Louisiana at the age of 19, and began playing in clubs in the mid-1950s with his cousin Chester Zeno on washboard. He took his stage name from a visiting dancer called Doopsie (and pronouncing his own name the same way). At the same time, he continued with his day job, eventually becoming an electrical contractor.

Dopsie played music for dancing, assimilating R&amp;B influences into zydeco and sometimes covering R&amp;B hits in a zydeco style. He performed around Louisiana, and recorded occasionally for small independent labels in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1976 he appeared at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and was signed by the Swedish record label Sonet, who issued his first album, &quot;Doin&#x27; The Zydeco&quot;, in 1976. Starting in 1979, he toured Europe regularly with his group, the Twisters, and his popularity there led to him recording a string of albums for Sonet in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In the 1980s, he started to gain attention in the US. He played accordion on the zydeco-influenced song &quot;That Was Your Mother&quot; on Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Graceland&quot; album in 1986. He recorded the album &quot;Crowned Prince Of Zydeco&quot; in 1987. His final album in 1991, &quot;Louisiana Music&quot;, received a Grammy Award nomination. Dopsie also recorded with Bob Dylan and Cyndi Lauper, and in 1992 appeared in the film &quot;Delta Heat&quot;. He died from a heart attack in 1993, aged 61, and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Lafayette.

==Legacy==
Since his death, his band, The Twisters, has continued to perform. Now led by his son Dopsie Jr. (accordionist, vocalist and washboard player), with sons Alton Jr. (&quot;Tiger&quot;) on drums, and Anthony Rubin on accordion, the band is called Rockin&#x27; Dopsie Jr. &amp; The Zydeco Twisters. Dopsie&#x27;s younger son Dwayne also plays accordion and leads his own band, Dwayne Dopsie &amp; the Zydeco Hellraisers.

Dopsie was related to professional tennis championship player Chanda Rubin.

==Quotation==

&quot;I&#x27;m the only man in the world that plays the accordion upside-down,&quot; Rockin&#x27; Dopsie said. &quot;It&#x27;s all because daddy didn&#x27;t taught me how to play. I just picked it up.&quot;

<text>The Senegambia (other names: Senegambia region or Senegambian zone, Senegàmbi in Wolof and Pulaar) is, in the narrow sense, a historical name for a geographical region in West Africa, named after the Senegal River in the north and the Gambia River in the south. However, there are also text sources which state that Senegambia is understood in a broader sense and equated with the term the Western region. This refers to the coastal areas between Senegal and Sierra Leone, where the inland border in the east was not further defined.

Geographically, the region lies within the tropical zone between the Sahel and the forests of Guinea, with Senegal and Gambian Rivers underpinning the region&#x27;s geographical unity. The region encompasses the modern states of Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, as well as portions of Mauritania, Mali, and Guinea. It should not be confused with the recent Senegambia Confederation, which was a loose confederation between The Gambia and Senegal from 1982 to 1989, set up just after The Gambia&#x27;s 1981 coup d&#x27;état where the Senegalese government intervened to reinstate the democratically elected Gambian government.

Spanning beyond the borders of the Senegambia Confederation, the Senegambia region was described by the Senegalese historian and scholar Professor Boubacar Barry of UCAD as historically &quot;the main gateway to Sudan, the cradle of the great empires of Ghana, Mali and Songhai&quot; and &quot;the centre of gravity for West Africa.&quot;

== History ==

According to Professor of IFAN and the Senghor University in Alexandria, Egypt, early humans appeared in Senegal around 350,000 years ago. Benga and Thiam posit that, it is in the Falémé valley in the southeast of the country where we find the oldest traces of human life.

In Senegambian Neolithic history, the period when humans became hunters, fishermen and producers (farmers and artisans) is well represented and studied. This is when more elaborate objects and ceramics emerged, testifying to various human activities. The Diakité excavation in Thiès shows evidence of human mobility over a distance of about 600 km, during the Senegambian Neolithic age.

Located in south of Mbour (in the Thiès Region), an ancient culture referred to as the &quot;Tiemassassien culture&quot;, &quot;Tiemassassien industry&quot;, &quot;Tiémassas&quot; or just &quot;Tiemassassien&quot; was discovered during a Senegalese excavation half a century ago. Descamps proposed that this culture pertains to the Neolithic Era about 10,000 years ago. Dagan however proposed the Upper Paleolithic Era. This culture was named after Thiès, the region it is in.

The Senegambian stone circles are also located in this zone. Numerous tumuli, burial mounds, some of which have been excavated, revealed materials that date between the 3rd century BC and the 16th century AD. According to UNESCO : &quot;Together the stone circles of laterite pillars and their associated burial mounds present a vast sacred landscape created over more than 1,500 years. It reflects a prosperous, highly organized and lasting society.&quot; See the Senegambian stone circles, Serer ancient history and Serer religion articles for more on this.
During the medieval period of Europe which corresponds roughly to the Golden Age of West Africa, several great empires and kingdoms sprang out from the Senegambia region, including but not limited to the great Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire, the Songhai Empire, the Jolof Empire, the Kaabu Empire, the Kingdoms of Sine, Saloum, Baol, Waalo and Takrur. During this period, several great dynasties rose and fell, and some, such as the Guelowar Dynasty of Sine and Saloum, survived for more than 600 years despite European colonialism, which fell as recently as 1969, nine years after Senegal gained its independence from France. It was also out of this region that the ancient lamanic class sprang. The ancient lamanes were the landowning class and kings. According to Barry, the &quot;lamanic system is the oldest form of land ownership in precolonial Senegambia.&quot;
From the 15th century, the region became a focus of Franco-British-Portuguese rivalry. The Portuguese were the first to arrive in the region in the 1450s. Until the 16th century, they held a monopoly on trade.

In 1677, the French took the island of Gorée, and in 1681 they took control of Albreda on the Gambia River. This started a rivalry with the English, and in 1692 they briefly confiscated Gorée and Saint-Louis. In 1758, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, Gorée was captured by the British, who held it until 1763. In 1765, the British formed the Senegambia Province. In 1778, during the American War of Independence, the French went on the offensive, and razed James Island in the River Gambia. In 1783, the Treaty of Versailles recognised British claims to The Gambia and French claims to Saint-Louis and Gorée, dissolving the Senegambia Province.

The French pursued a policy of expansion and saw The Gambia as an obstacle. In the late 19th century, they proposed ceding Dabou, Grand Bassam, and Assinie in return for The Gambia. The negotiations broke down but were repeatedly brought up again. After the failed 1981 coup d&#x27;état in The Gambia, a Senegambia Confederation was proposed and accepted. This lasted until 1989.

==Culture==

The Senegambia region has a rich culture including joking relationships (Sanankuya) between patrilineal clans and ethnic groups. This joking relationship ensures peaceful coexistence where one ethnic group can criticize or even insult another without the recipient taking offence. This bond of cousinage is called &quot;maasir&quot; or &quot;kalir&quot; in Serer, &quot;kal&quot; by the Wolof, &quot;kallengooraxu&quot; in Soninke, &quot;sanaawyaa&quot; in western Mandinka, and &quot;agelor&quot; in Joola (Fogny)

The griot caste are found extensively in the Senegambia region. They preserve genealogy, history and culture of the people. There is also a mutual exchange of cuisines among the inhabitants of this region. For example Thieboudienne a Senegalese national dish and notably known as Jollof rice, which is an international export, named after the Kingdom of Jolof in present-day Senegal, originated from Saint-Louis. Tigadèguèna, a peanut stew originated in Mali. Maafe called &quot;domoda&quot; in Gambia originated in Senegal.

Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Africa&#x27;s most famous singer (according to Rolling Stone magazine (2014)), and who held the title as Africa&#x27;s most powerful and biggest music export before Akon (who incidentally is also from this region) for several decades is from this region. The African Renaissance Monument built in 2010 in Dakar, standing at 49 m (161 feet) is the tallest statue in Africa.

From the old and sacred music genre of njuup, to the modern mbalax beats (derived from the Serer njuup tradition), the region has a rich and old music and dance tradition. Traditional Senegalese wrestling called njom in Serer, laamb in Wolof and siɲɛta in Bambara is a favourite pastime and national sport in some parts of the region especially in Senegal.

==Media==

Senegambian media are varied and include several radio stations, television channels, newspapers and Internet. Some of these radio stations and TV channels such as Radiodiffusion Télévision Sénégalaise, Radio Gambia and GRTS are publicly owned, but most of the media especially radio stations and newspapers are privately owned.

On 4 October 1973, Radio Senegal (Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision du Sénégal (ORTS) as it was known at the time), which had been in talks with Radio Gambia about producing a joint radio programme based on Senegambian history and broadcast in the local Senegambian languages came to an agreement, and the first ever recording of the programme &quot;Chossani Senegambia&quot; (the history of Senegambia) was made. The show was prerecorded and both Senegal and Gambia broadcast at the same time every Tuesday. That was the first show of its kind within the Senegambia region, where two media houses from different states broadcast the same show at the same time every week. The Gambian historian, and statesman Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof who was former Director of Programmes and Head of Local Languages at Radio Gambia was one of the pioneers of that joint programme. In his book, &quot;Senegambia - The land of our heritage&quot; (1995), p 12, Cham Joof writes:
==Ethnic groups==
The Senegambian zone is home to various Senegambian ethnic groups including Wolof, Peul (or Fula), Tukulor (or Toucouleur), Manding, Sereer (or Serer), Soninke, Susu (or Sousou), Joola, Nalu, Baga, Beafada, Bainuk, and Bassari.

<text>Thirteenth Step is the second studio album by American rock band A Perfect Circle, released on September 16, 2003. The album sold well, charting at the number 2 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in its premiere week, selling over 231,000 copies and staying on the charts for 78 weeks. The album went on to be certified as gold on November 4, 2003, and as platinum on March 24, 2006, by the RIAA. Three singles were released from the album, &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, which topped both the Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks, followed by &quot;The Outsider&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, which also charted on the respective charts.

==Background==

===Writing and recording===
The band&#x27;s writing process was very different from the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;. With the first album, a majority of the album had been already written and recorded over a long period of time by guitarist Billy Howerdel, before a band had even been assembled. He had recorded it with a female vocalist in mind, but upon Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan hearing it and offering to sing for the material, the content was then quickly finalized upon adding Keenan&#x27;s vocals and re-recording the drums with band member Josh Freese. With beginning the second album, the band found themselves starting fresh, without any material to start with, with the exception of the track &quot;Vanishing&quot;, which originally was intended to be on the band&#x27;s first album, but Howerdel could not find the song file in the studio, having accidentally named it &quot;test&quot;. Upon finally recovering the track in 2001, it was only slightly altered for its final release, to better match the eventual sound of &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;. The title &quot;Vanishing&quot; was a tongue in cheek allusion to the fact that the song itself had gone missing.

Writing for the album started while Keenan was still touring with his other band, Tool, in support of their 2001 album &quot;Lateralus&quot;. Howerdel would write most of the music, while Keenan would write most of the lyrics. As such, Howerdel would send work in progress instrumental he would create, and Keenan would write lyrics in between shows, a process they found to be efficient, but ultimately more difficult to balance than they initially expected. Keenan&#x27;s work with Tool was not the only thing delaying work on the album, as progress was also hampered by other lineup changes, including guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen leaving to be a member of Queens of the Stone Age, and bassist Paz Lenchantin leaving to be a member of Zwan, leading to their contributions to the album being limited to only a few tracks. Lenchantin would be replaced by Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White, while Van Leeuwen would be replaced by Danny Lohner on the album and later James Iha for touring purposes, as Iha did not actually perform on the album.

Once touring for Tool was over with, Keenan returned to the studio to work in person with the rest of the band on the album. The sessions were, as such, marked with far more collaboration, especially between Howerdel and Keenan, now that Howerdel knew who his vocalist was, and what types of ideas he&#x27;d support. At times, this would cause a creative struggle between the two as well; since Keenan was involved with some of Howerdel&#x27;s music writing this time around, he would sometimes give more input in the music, with the two sometimes wanting to move in opposite directions. Keenan, in particular, wanted to move away from the general hard rock sound of &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, feeling that taking that approach again would be &quot;redundant&quot;. He instead pushed for a softer sound, focusing more on atmospherics and ambience. Conversely, Howerdel preferred the heavier compositions written while waiting for Keenan to return from Tool. White, relatively new to the band, often played the role of mediator between the two, being able to offer an outsider&#x27;s perspective of the situation.

Danny Lohner played a large part of the productions of the track &quot;The Noose&quot;, whereas &quot;The Package&quot; was a full-band collaboration that started with Howerdel playing the song&#x27;s basic guitar riff in front of everyone.

===Concept and themes===
&quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is a concept album about the different aspects and perspectives of addiction, and the recovery from it. The album&#x27;s title itself is a reference to the 12 step program of Alcoholics Anonymous. Lead vocalist and primary lyricist of the band Maynard James Keenan explained the concept on the band&#x27;s DVD &quot;Amotion&quot;, stating:
&quot;The songs on &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; for the most part are about the various processes of addiction, behavioral addictions, chemical addictions, and each song is kind of sung from a different perspective. I have a lot of friends who&#x27;ve gone through a lot of these situations. Some of the songs are sung from the perspective of the actual drug, from the perspective of someone who has realized that they have an issue or a problem, also from the perspective of a person who realizes that if they don&#x27;t do something they&#x27;re going to die, a song from the perspective of a person who is in denial about a loved one, dying right before their eyes. And in the case of &quot;The Outsider&quot;, it&#x27;s sung from the perspective of a person who doesn&#x27;t understand at all what their friend is going through, what their loved one is going through, and they think that it&#x27;s more like a sprained ankle; they can just kind of walk it off.&quot;

Keenan, not having struggled with addiction first-hand, drew from experiencing it happen to others around him, such as Layne Staley, the lead singer of Alice in Chains, who died in 2002 due to drug addiction. The song &quot;The Package&quot; is from the perspective of an addict, desperate for more, while &quot;Blue&quot; is from the perspective of someone having a difficult time dealing with the aftermath of an overdose.

&quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is a cover of the song by Failure, originally featured on the 1996 album &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
The album was released on September 16, 2003, and debuted at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, with 231,000 copies sold. Three singles were released from the album, &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, which topped both the Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, and &quot;Blue&quot;. &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; and &quot;The Outsider&quot; managed to crossover into mainstream pop radio formats as well, with the two charting at number 61 and 79 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA in early 2006.

The band toured extensively for the rest of 2003 and in early 2004 in support of the album. Just prior to the 2004 Presidential Election, the band released &quot;Emotive&quot;, a collection of political war cover songs, which contained &quot;Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums&quot;, which was a reinterpretation of the track &quot;Pet&quot;, and a remix album titled &quot;Amotion&quot;, which contained remixed versions of the tracks across their three albums, including the three singles from &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Media reception to &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; was generally favorable; aggregating website Metacritic reported a rating of 74 percent based on 11 critical reviews. AllMusic strongly praised the album for having &quot;the sound of a musical and lyrical maturity that normally doesn&#x27;t occur until a band&#x27;s third or fourth albums&quot;, and concluded that &quot;Lyrically, musically, sonically, the &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is proof positive that mainstream rock has plenty of life and vision left in it.&quot;

<text>Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass. The course, typically long, may include surfaces of grass and earth, pass through woodlands and open country, and include hills, flat ground and sometimes gravel road and minor obstacles. It is both an individual and a team sport; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during autumn and winter, and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures.

Cross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of athletics and is a natural-terrain version of long-distance track and road running. Although open-air running competitions are prehistoric, the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain. The English championship became the first national competition in 1876, and the International Cross Country Championships was held for the first time in 1903. Since 1973, the foremost elite competition has been the World Athletics Cross Country Championships.

The highest level circuit of professional cross country competition is the World Athletics Cross Country Tour Gold level, administered by World Athletics since 2021.

==Race course==
===Course design===
While a course may include natural or artificial obstacles, cross country courses support continuous running, and do not require climbing over high barriers, through deep ditches, or fighting through the underbrush, as do military-style assault courses.

A course at least full allows competitors to pass others during the race. Clear markings keep competitors from making wrong turns, and spectators from interfering with the competition. Markings may include tape or ribbon on both sides of the course, chalk or paint on the ground, or cones. Some classes use colored flags to indicate directions: red flags for left turns, yellow flags for right turns, and blue flags to continue straight or stay within ten feet of the flag. Courses also commonly include distance markings, usually at each kilometer or each mile.

The course should have of level terrain before the first turn, to reduce contact and congestion at the start. However, many courses at smaller competitions have their first turn after a much shorter distance. The course should also have a corral or chute after the finish line to facilitate the recording of finishing positions.

===Distances===

Courses for international competitions consist of a loop between 1,750 and 2,000 meters. Athletes complete three to six loops, depending on the race. Senior men and women compete on a 10-kilometre course, junior men compete on an 8-kilometre course, and junior women compete on a 6-kilometre course.

In the United States, college men typically compete on or courses, while college women race for or . High school students typically race on or courses.

==Strategy==
Because of differences between courses in running surface, frequency and tightness of turns, and amount of up and downhill, cross country strategy does not necessarily simplify to running a steady pace from start to finish. Coaches and cross country runners debate the relative merits of fast starts to get clear of the field, versus steady pacing to maximize physiological efficiency. Some teams emphasize running in a group in order to provide encouragement to others on the team, while others hold that every individual should run his or her own race. In addition, whether one runs ahead of &quot;the pack&quot; or behind it and pull ahead in the end is important, but can vary according to the runner&#x27;s individual skill, endurance, and the length of the race. Runners should also account for food intake prior to the race. Most important, however, is the training beforehand.

==Equipment==
Cross country running involves very little specialized equipment. Most races are run in shorts and vests or singlets, usually in club or school colours. In particularly cold conditions, long-sleeved shirts and tights can be worn to retain warmth without losing mobility. The most common footwear are cross country spikes, lightweight racing shoes with a rubber sole and five or more metal spikes screwed into the forefoot part of the sole. Spike length depends on race conditions, with a muddy course appropriate for spikes as long as . If a course has a harder surface, spikes as short as may be most effective. While spikes are suitable for grassy, muddy, or other slippery conditions, runners may choose to wear racing flats, rubber-soled racing shoes without spikes, if the course includes significant portions of paved surfaces or dirt road.

==History==

In 1819, boys at Shrewsbury School asked their headmaster, Dr Butler, if they could form a fox-hunting club, and he refused. The boys therefore formed an alternative club where instead of riding horses and chasing hounds they ran across country, with a small number of boys starting first to simulate the prey, and the rest following after an interval as though they were the chasing pack of dogs. Thus the terminology of hunting with dogs became associated with cross country running, with the leaders being called the hares, and the chasing pack the hounds. The hares carried a sack of paper scraps that they dropped to simulate their scent and provide a trail for the hounds to follow, and this sport was called paper chasing, or Hare and Hounds. Becoming popular at the school by 1831 it had become part of the curriculum, with several courses of different lengths. The original course of a little more than three miles was over some land owned by a farmer called Tuck, and is to this day known simply as Tucks.

These boys did not invent the idea of running across country, which had been known for centuries. Schools started the process of turning an adventurous and athletic pastime into an organised sport. The Scottish King Malcolm III is said to have summoned men to race up Craig Choinnich overlooking Braemar with the aim of finding the fastest runner in Scotland to be his royal messenger, and a 1540 manuscript in the British Museum describes a run across Roodee, also known as Chester Racecourse, for a prize of &quot;six glayves of silver.&quot;

William Shakespeare, writing in the early 17th century, has Sir John Falstaff tell Prince Henry, &quot;I would give a thousand pounds, I could run as fast as thou canst,&quot; and Samuel Pepys in his diary for 10 August 1660 describes going to Hyde Park to see, &quot;a fine foot-race three times round the Park between an Irishman and Crow, that was once my Lord Claypoole&#x27;s footman.&quot; In his diary for the year 1720, whilst he was an undergraduate at Oxford university, Sir Erasmus Phillips (1699–1743) later the MP for Haverfordwest, describes how he rode out to Woodstock Park one afternoon where he was one of, &quot;a most prodigious concourse of people,&quot; who saw a four-mile foot race between the duke of Wharton&#x27;s footman and Mr Diston&#x27;s footman.&quot; In July 1826 &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; reported that, &quot;Yesterday se&#x27;nnight a match of running, between the gentlemen of Milton and the gentlemen of Chart, was won by the latter.&quot;

By 1834, Hare and Hounds was known at Rugby school, and their route, the &quot;Barby Hill Run&quot;, was described in an 1857 novel, &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, by Thomas Hughes, who had gone to Rugby but was by then an influential politician. At Eton College, the chasing pack were known as Beagles, but in many other places they are called Harriers (a breed of dog used largely for hunting hares). At Harrow School they ran across farmland at Pinner, but Winchester school did not start cross country until sometime in the 1880s. In 1837, Rugby School started a longer run of approximately twelve miles known as the Crick Run because it goes out to the village of Crick and returns to the school. This has become an annual tradition and continues to this day.

By the early 1850s, athletic clubs had started holding their own paper chases as a form of training, the sport was seen at Oxford University by that time and a national championship was first held on 7 December 1867. It was held on Wimbledon Common in south-west London. It was not particularly well organised, many runners went off course, and it was declared void and had to be rerun, but it was a start and the championship has been held over the distance of 10 miles (16,093 metres) since 1877.

In 1869, Thames Hare and Hounds, the world&#x27;s first cross country running club, was formed in the same area of south west London, and the same year William C. Vosburgh of New York introduced the sport to the United States. Harvard University held races from 1880, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge held their first cross country contest at Oxford in December 1880.

Three area associations were formed to administer the sport in their region of England. The Midland Counties Amateur Cross-Country Association was formed in 1879, the Northern Cross-Country Association in 1882, and the Southern Counties Cross-Country Association was established in 1883. Then also in 1883 the National Cross-Country Union was formed, with Walter Rye, the founder of Thames Hare and Hounds, as first President. In 1933 this was changed to the English Cross-Country Union because by then the other constituent countries of the United Kingdom had their own cross country associations. The Scottish Cross Country Union was formed in 1886 and held their first national championship at Lanark in March of that year, and the United States followed suit in 1887.

Over time the sacks of paper scraps gradually got discarded and courses came to be marked with flags, lines on the grass, bunting, and marshalls, with races held on farm land, through forests, and over various forms of mixed terrain with championships frequently being held on golf courses and horse racing courses.

In 1898, Harold Hardwick of Salford Harriers took a team across to France for a cross country match and in the process invented international cross country running as a sport. The International Cross Country Union was formed in 1903, and the four home nations of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales started a match in that year which became a true international event in 1907 when France sent a team to compete. Other European countries sent teams during the 1920s and Tunisia sent a team in 1958.

The idea for a cross country relay originated in Paris in 1903, when the members of Stadte Francaise invited South London Harriers to Paris for a relay race of approximately fourteen miles to be held on Boxing Day, 26 December 1903. It is not known whether South London Harriers took up the invitation or whether the race actually took place. The first cross country relay for which there is definite evidence was organised by Hampstead Harriers at their club headquarters, the Green Man pub in East Finchley, also on Boxing Day, Wednesday 26 December 1906. The race had five teams of three men who each ran around two miles over a snow-covered out and back course. The first man to finish was G. Banbrook of team three in a time of 41:42 1/5.

Women were largely excluded from the sport for many years due to a widespread but false perception that it was injurious to their health and reproductive ability. Women were also excluded because they did not receive formal education, and the sport started largely at schools, from which women were excluded—women first went to university in England in 1868. There were races for women, but they were few and far between. At the Longtown Sports in Cumbria in June 1851 the prize for the women&#x27;s race was three times that for the men&#x27;s, and the first three women all got the same prize, whereas the second-placed man only got half the winner&#x27;s prize. Women&#x27;s sports clubs and formal competitions for women&#x27;s teams did not arrive until the 1920s. France was the first country to hold national championships for women, in 1918, the first English championships for women were held at Hoo Park, Luton, in February 1927, and women were allowed to participate informally in international cross country only from 1931. There were not even officially any rules for women&#x27;s cross country until 1962 and their races were not considered championships until 1967.

===Olympic Games===
Cross country was contested as a team and individual event at the 1912, 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics. Sweden took gold in 1912, and Finland, led by Paavo Nurmi, captured the gold in 1920 and 1924. During the 1924 race in the Paris heat wave, only 15 of the 38 competitors reached the finish. Eight of those were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tight circles after reaching the stadium and later knocked himself unconscious, while another fainted 50 meters from the finish. José Andía and Edvin Wide were reported dead, and medics spent hours trying to find all the competitors who had blacked out along the course.

Although the reports of deaths were unfounded, spectators were shocked by the attrition rate and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future games. Since 1928, cross country has been contested only as the fifth discipline of the modern pentathlon, and until 2016 it was the only discipline where the Olympic competition was only part of the modern pentathlon.

There have been recent efforts to bring cross country running back to the Olympic Games. In 2020, World Athletics President Sebastian Coe pushed to bring the sport to the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, but the IOC rejected this proposal. Once the 2024 Summer Olympics arrived, Coe pushed for the sport to instead be included in the Winter Olympics, with efforts to make the sport appear in the 2030 and 2034 Winter Olympics in the French Alps and Salt Lake City respectively.

===World championships===
Beginning in 1973, the IAAF began hosting the renamed World Cross Country Championships each year.

In 1975, the New Zealand men and United States women won, marking the first championships by non-European countries. In 1981 an African nation (Ethiopia) won the men&#x27;s race for the first time, and a decade later an African nation (Kenya) won the women&#x27;s race for the first time. Ethiopia or Kenya has captured every men&#x27;s title since 1981 and every women&#x27;s title since 2001. Through 2010, Kenya has won 40 World Cross Country Championships and Ethiopia has won 23.

===Notable athletes===
* Kenenisa Bekele won both short and long World Cross Country course titles in the same year five times (2002–2006), after a junior men victory and senior long course silver in 2001. The IAAF calls him the &quot;greatest ever male cross country runner to have graced the sport.&quot;
* Edward Cheserek is the three-time individual winner of the NCAA Division I championship in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Cheserek is the only athlete to win three straight individual NCAA championships.

==Regional organizations==
Beyond championships, IAAF world cross country meetings include the Great Edinburgh International Cross Country, Cross Internacional de Itálica, Antrim International Cross Country, Cinque Mulini, Nairobi Cross, Chiba International Cross Country, Fukuoka International Cross Country meet, Eurocross and Almond Blossom Cross Country.

===Australia===
Cross country running is organized at the state level by the athletics association for each state. In Queensland, it is organized by Queensland Athletics. In the Masters category, which includes runners over 30, this is organized by Australian Masters Athletics. There is also the Australian Masters Nationals Championships.

The cross country season in Brisbane is usually March–September. During the season, there is usually one race each week in a different park, generally organized and hosted by one of the participating clubs.

===Canada===
Cross country running is a far-reaching sport in Canada. In middle school, races are more serious and are divided by grade and gender. In high school, the races are far-reaching and tend to be the main talent pool, especially at the senior level, for university or national-level runners. At the university level, the sport is administered by Canadian Interuniversity Sport.

===India===
National Championship is held every year by Athletics Federation of India. Nagaland hosted 56th National cross country Championship. It was held along with South Asian Cross country championship which was held by South Asian Athletics Federation. Last edition edition was held in Indira Gandhi Stadium, Kohima. Himalayan Adventure Challenge is another extreme cross country race held in Himalayan mountain slopes.

===United Kingdom===
Primary schools, although more often the juniors, also participate in cross country events and some areas of England have done so since the late 1960s. An example would be schools near Ouston, County Durham which compete as part of Chester-le-Street &amp; District Primary Cross Country Association.

===United States===
USA Track &amp; Field (USATF) hosts four annual national cross country championships. The USA Cross Country Championships, first held in 1890, include six races: masters women (8 km), masters men (8 km), junior women (6 km), junior men (8 km), open women (8 km) and open men (12 km). In addition to crowning national champions, the championships serve as the trials race to select the Team USA squad for the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. The USATF Masters 5 km Cross Country Championships, first held in 2002, incl men&#x27;s race and a women&#x27;s race. The USATF National Club Cross Country Championships, first held in 1998, feature the top clubs from across the United States, who vie for honors and bragging rights as the nation&#x27;s top cross country team. The USATF National Junior Olympic Cross Country Championships, first held in 2001, has raced for boys and girls in five two-year age divisions.

Most American universities and colleges field men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country teams as part of their athletic program. Over 900 men&#x27;s cross country teams and over 1000 women&#x27;s cross country teams compete in the three divisions of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Men usually race or , and women usually race or .

==== High School ====
Above the youth or middle school level, every state offers cross country as a high school sport for boys and girls. Over 440,000 high school students compete in cross country each year, making it the sixth-most popular sport for girls, and seventh most popular for boys. High school students typically race on or courses.

The Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California hosts the largest cross country invitational in the United States, with over 22,000 runners from community colleges, high schools and elementary schools competing. The meet started in 1948 and continues today.

There are two major national championships on the high school level; the Nike Cross Nationals, and the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships.

Beginning with Nike Cross Nationals, this competition splits the United States into eight qualifying regions with their own respective regional events, listed below.

After these eight regionals, the Nike Cross Nationals itself will take place on December 7, 2024 at the Glendoveer Golf Course in Portland, Oregon.

The Foot Locker Cross Country Championships, sponsored by HOKA, are managed similarly, with four regionals instead of eight, detailed in the chart below. The 2023 Foot Locker Championships took place on December 9 at Balboa Park in San Diego, CA.
===== Notes =====

=== Notable races ===
* World Cross Country Championships is an international cross country championship race hosted by World Athletics (formerly the IAAF) in which athletes represent their home countries. Since 2011, the race has been held every two years. World Athletics describes the race as &quot;the most grueling, ‘back to basics’ event of the World Athletics Series.&quot;
* NCAA Division I Cross Country Championships are races held for men and women by the NCAA every fall as the culminating events of the inter-collegiate cross country season. Runners represent their schools and can qualify either as a team or as an individual. The NCAA describes the Division I races as &quot;one of the most intriguing of all DI championships.&quot;

The competition consists of four races: the junior men’s 6 km, the junior women’s 4 km, senior men’s 8 km and senior women’s 6 km. While the event frequently attracts world-class competition, it has not been held since 2019.

=== Notable courses ===
* Franklin Park is a park in Boston, described as a &quot;famed cross country course,&quot; hosted the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in 1992. The course hosts high school races, college, and professional races, including the New England Cross Country Championships. It is also home the annual Battle in Beantown collegiate invitational.
* Van Cortlandt Park is located in The Bronx, New York City, and has been described as &quot;the most storied cross country course in the United States.&quot; The park has hosted NCAA cross championships, world cross country championships, and is used for training by many elite runners in the area. It is also home to the annual Manhattan College Cross Country Invitational.
* LaVern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course, dubbed &quot;Cross Country Town USA,&quot; is located in Terre Haute, Indiana, and is the home course of Indiana State University. It has hosted the NCAA Division I Cross Country championships 12 times. The course is notable because it was designed specifically for cross country races.
* Thomas Zimmer Championship Course is located on the campus of the University of Wisconsin Madison. The course opened in the fall of 2009, and was host to the 2018 NCAA Cross Country Championship. The course is also home to the annual Nuttycomb Wisconsin Invitational, one of the largest collegiate cross country competitions.

=== Eating disorders ===
Physical leanness is desirable to achieve competitive success in cross country running. This emphasis on body weight has led to a culture of eating disorders within the sport. Scholars have cited a high incidence of eating disorders among cross country (long-distance) runners. They have noted that while eating disorders can occur in all runners, they are far more prevalent among female athletes. Other factors, such as social pressures and the overall stress of the college environment also contribute to the prevalence of eating disorders among female college cross country runners. Following professional runner Mary Cain&#x27;s 2019 account of how the competitive pressures of long distance running contributed to her eating disorder, many other prominent female cross country athletes have tried to bring attention to the issue of eating disorders in the sport.

<doc id="344463" wikidata="Q160819" url="?curid=344463" title="Gambia River">
<text>The Gambia River (formerly known as the River Gambra, French: &quot;Fleuve Gambie&quot;, Portuguese: &quot;Rio Gâmbia&quot;) is a major river in West Africa, running from the Fouta Djallon plateau in north Guinea westward through Senegal and The Gambia to the Atlantic Ocean at the city of Banjul. It is navigable for about half that length.

The river is strongly associated with The Gambia, the smallest country in mainland Africa, which occupies the downstream half of the river and its two banks.

==Geography==
The Gambia River runs a total length of . From the Fouta Djallon, it runs northwest into the Tambacounda Region of Senegal, where it flows through the Parc National du Niokolo Koba, then is joined by the Nieri Ko and and passing through the Barrakunda Falls before entering the Gambia at Koina. At this point, the river runs generally west, but in a meandering course with a number of oxbows, and about from its mouth it gradually widens, to over wide where it meets the sea.

===Crossings===
There are several bridges crossing the river. The largest and furthest downriver is the Senegambia Bridge between the towns of Farafenni and Soma in The Gambia. Opened in January 2019, it provides a link between the stretches of the Trans-Gambia Highway on the North and South Bank of the river. It also provides an expedited connection for Senegalese trucks traveling to and from Casamance. The bridge is long and replaces a previously-unreliable vehicle ferry. A toll is levied on vehicle crossings.

There are also bridges in the Upper River Region of The Gambia at Basse Santa Su and Fatoto that opened in October 2021, as well as a bridge in Senegal at Gouloumbou.

All other crossings are done by ferry, including a primary crossing between Banjul and Barra at the mouth of the river, or by small boat. 

===Bolongs===
Small tributaries on the lower stretches of the river are commonly referred to as &quot;bolongs&quot; or &quot;bolons.&quot; These include Sami Bolong dividing the northern halves of the Central River Division and Upper River Division, Bintang Bolong dividing the Lower River Division from the West Coast Division, as well as smaller bodies of water such as the Sofancama, Jurunku, Kutang, Nianji, and Sandugu bolongs.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of the area along the Gambia river include the Jola, the Balante, the Bainuk, and the Manjak. The Carthaginian explorer Hanno the Navigator may have reached the Gambia during his expedition in the fifth century BC.

According to oral tradition, large numbers of Mandinka immigrants from Mali led by Tiramakhan Traore, one of Sundiata&#x27;s top generals, came to the region in the 14th century. Some modern historians, however, posit that relatively few immigrants, primarily &quot;jula&quot; traders, instead led a gradual socio-cultural shift towards identification with the higher-status Mandinka ethnicity and the ruling Mali Empire. These &quot;jula&quot; made the Gambia an important part of the wider West African trade network, where salt, shellfish, iron, cloth, ivory, beeswax, gold, slaves, leather and more were exchanged as far as the Niger River and beyond.

Alvise Cadamosto, a Venetian explorer working for the Portuguese, became the first European to sail to the Gambia in 1455, referring to the river as the &quot;Gambra&quot; or &quot;Cambra&quot;. Other sources from that period record names such as &quot;Guambea&quot;, &quot;Guabu&quot;, and &quot;Gambu&quot; (possibly a conflation, at the time or in later historiography, of the name of the river and the kingdom of Kaabu). While merchants of various European countries traded on the Gambia river for two centuries after Cadamosto, the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was the first to establish a permanent base, on what they called St Andrew&#x27;s Island in 1651. After taking control of the island and renaming it &#x27;St James&#x27; in 1661, the English vied with the French for commercial domination of the river for the next century and a half. 

During this period, kingdoms along the river Gambia included Niumi (also known as Barra), Niani, Kantora, Jimara, Kiang, Badibu, Fuladu, Tumana, and Wuli, all of which have lent their names to districts of The Gambia today. Major trading posts on or near the river included Barra, Albreda, Juffure, James Island (now a UNESCO World Heritage Site), Tendeba, Joar, MacCarthy Island, Fattatenda, and Sutukoba. 

Around the turn of the 18th century, the Scottish explorer Mungo Park traveled up the Gambia twice on his way to the Niger River. 

The Anglo-French Convention of 1889 delimited the borders of the Gambia Protectorate and the colony of Senegal as being ten kilometers north and south of the river as far inland as Yarbutenda (near modern-day Koina), with a 10km radius to mark the eastern border measured from the center of town. The British therefore controlled the river as far as it was navigable by sea-going vessels. Though widely seen as temporary at the time, the borders set in 1889 have remained unchanged ever since.

==Flora and fauna==
The aquatic fauna in the Gambia River basin is closely associated with that of the Senegal River basin, and the two are usually combined under a single ecoregion known as the Senegal-Gambia Catchments. Although the species richness is moderately high, only three species of frogs and one fish are endemic to this ecoregion.

Oysters are harvested from the River Gambia by women and used to make oyster stew, a traditional dish in the cuisine of Gambia.

* (一握の砂) (A Handful of Sand) 1910
* (悲しき玩具) (Sad Toys) published posthumously in 1912

* 1903 - Went home to Shibutami. Serial articles &quot;Ideas of Wagner&quot; appeared in Iwate Nippo. Poem &quot;Shucho&quot; (Sorrowful Melodies) appeared in &quot;Myōjō&quot;.

Later despite efforts to visit Chieko in her home in Sapporo, to pursue courtship, he had learned from her father that she had recently married.

<text>was a Japanese author, poet and court noble of the Heian period. He is best known as the principal compiler of the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;, also writing its Japanese Preface, and as a possible author of the &quot;Tosa Diary&quot;, although this was published anonymously. He is well known for his &quot;waka&quot; poetry and is counted as one of the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals selected by Fujiwara no Kintō; his poetry was included also in the &quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot;. As a courtier, he served as Governor of Tosa (930–935), Vice Governor of Kaga (917–923) and Vice Governor of Mino Province (918–923).

== Biography ==

Tsurayuki was born in either 866 or 872, the son of Ki no Mochiyuki and a court dancer of the &quot;naikyoubou&quot; (内教坊), whose name is unknown. He had the childhood name of Akokuso (阿古久曽).

In the 890s he became a poet of &quot;waka&quot;, short poems composed in Japanese. In 905, under the order of Emperor Daigo, he was one of four poets selected to compile the &quot;Kokin Wakashū (Kokinshu)&quot;, the first imperially-sponsored anthology (&quot;chokusen-shū&quot;) of &quot;waka&quot; poetry.

After holding a few offices in Kyoto, he was appointed governor of Tosa Province and stayed there from 930 until 935. Later he was presumably appointed governor of Suō Province, since it was recorded that he held a &quot;waka&quot; party (&quot;Utaai&quot;) at his home in Suo.

He was one of the editors of the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;. Tsurayuki wrote one of two prefaces to &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;; the other is in Chinese. His preface was the first critical essay on &quot;waka&quot;. He wrote of its history from its mythological origin to his contemporary &quot;waka&quot;, which he grouped into genres, referred to some major poets and gave a bit of harsh criticism to his predecessors like Ariwara no Narihira.

Tsurayuki composed well over 500 poems throughout his life, including those included in the &quot;Kokinshu&quot;, imperial collections, and personal collections. One of his &quot;waka&quot; was included in the &quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot;, which was compiled in the 13th century by Fujiwara no Teika.

His death is recorded in the &quot;Sanjurokunin kasenden&quot; (三十六人歌仙伝) as potentially being May 18, 945, but it is also reported as being on June 30 of the same year.

== Works ==

=== &quot;Kokin Wakashu&quot; ===
In 905, under the order of Emperor Daigo, Ki no Tsurayuki was one of four poets selected to compile the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; (&quot;Kokinshū&quot;), the first imperially-sponsored anthology (&quot;chokusenshū&quot;) of waka. Tsurayuki was the chief editor of the Kokinshu, and was the author of its Japanese preface (Kokin_Wakash%C5%AB). 

=== &quot;Tosa Nikki&quot; ===
In addition to the Kokinshu, Tsurayuki&#x27;s supposed major literary work (though it was published anonymously) was the Tosa Nikki (土佐日記, &quot;Tosa Diary&quot;), which was written using kana. The Tosa Diary is written from the perspective of a woman who embarks on a 55-day trip in 934 to the capital (present day Kyoto), where Tsurayuki had been the provincial governor, from her home in the Tosa Province. The female perspective of the diary, though written by a man (Tsurayuki), has sparked debate among scholars regarding gender and social status within the realm of linguistics of the time period. Ki no Tsurayuki left the Tosa Province at the age of 66 in 934 after completing his term as Provincial Governor and wrote the Tosa Nikki after returning to the capital. There are quite a few references within the diary that allude to events that took place in Ki no Tsurayuki&#x27;s life, including the death of his daughter. It also includes many poems, presumably written by Tsurayuki.

===&quot;Tale of Genji&quot;===

<doc id="344480" wikidata="Q405234" url="?curid=344480" title="Takiji Kobayashi">
<text>was a Japanese writer of proletarian literature.

He is best known for his short novel &quot;Kanikōsen&quot;, or &quot;Crab Cannery Ship&quot;, published in 1929. It tells the story of the hard life of cannery workers, fishermen and seamen on board a cannery ship and the beginning of their revolt against the company and its managers.

The young writer died due to violent torture after arrest by the &quot;Tokkō&quot; police two years later, at the age of 29.

==Biography==
Kobayashi was born in Odate, Akita, Japan. At the age of four, his family moved to Otaru, Hokkaido. The family was not wealthy, but Kobayashi&#x27;s uncle paid his schooling expenses and he was able to attend Hokkaido Otaru Commercial High School and Otaru Commercial School of Higher Learning, which is the current Otaru University of Commerce. While studying, he became interested in writing, and submitted essays to literary magazines, served in the editorial committee for his school&#x27;s alumni association magazine, and also had his own writing published. One of his teachers at school was economist, critic, and poet . Around this time, due to financial hardship and the current economic recession of the time, he joined the labour movement.

After graduating from school, he worked in the Otaru branch of the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank. In the 1928 general election, Kobayashi helped with election candidate Kenzo Yamamoto&#x27;s campaign, and went to Yamamoto&#x27;s campaign speech in a village at the base of Mount Yōtei. This experience was later incorporated into his book . In the same year, his story &quot;March 15, 1928&quot; (based on the March 15 incident) was published in the literary magazine &quot;Senki&quot; (&quot;Standard of Battle&quot; in Japanese). The story depicted torture by the &quot;Tokkō&quot; special higher police, which in turn infuriated government officials.

In 1929, Kobayashi&#x27;s novel &quot;Kanikōsen&quot; about a crab-fishing and canning ship&#x27;s crew determined to stand up to a cruel manager under harsh conditions was published in &quot;Senki&quot;. It quickly gained attention and notoriety, and became a standard-bearer of Marxist proletarian literature. In July of that year, it was adapted into a theatrical performance and was performed at the Imperial Garden Theater under the title . The full text of &quot;Kanikōsen&quot;, now the length of a short novel, was not available in Japan until 1948. &quot;Kanikōsen&quot; was subsequently published three times translated into English as &quot;The Cannery Boat&quot; (1933), &quot;The Factory Ship&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Crab Cannery Ship&quot; (2013), as well as in other languages.

Also in 1929, Kobayashi published &quot;The Absentee Landlord&quot;, after having worked on several versions. This book describes the hard life of local or immigrant tenant farmers on the northern island of Hokkaido, and their struggle with the way they are treated by rich landowners, as Japan was making efforts to strengthen its colonization of this island and to develop its agriculture and industry. The story is located in the unnamed village of &#x27;S.&#x27;, close to the town of Asahikawa, along the Ishikari River valley, about 80 miles North East of Otaru where Kobayashi was living.

The police (in particular the Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu or &quot;Tokkō&quot;) marked Kobayashi for surveillance, and in the same year the publication of his new book in the &quot;Chūōkōron&quot; magazine became grounds for his dismissal from his job at the bank.

In the spring of 1930, Kobayashi moved to Tokyo and became the secretary general of the Proletarian Writer&#x27;s Guild of Japan. On May 23 he was arrested on suspicion of giving financial support to the Japanese Communist Party, and was temporarily released on June 7. After returning to Tokyo on June 24, he was again arrested and in July, due to &quot;Kanikōsen&quot; he was further indicted on charges of Lèse majesté. In August, he was prosecuted under the Public Order and Police Law of 1900 and was imprisoned in Toyotama Penitentiary. On January 22, 1931, he was released on bail. He then secluded himself at the Nanasawa Hot Spring in Kanagawa Prefecture. In October 1931, Kobayashi officially became a member of the outlawed Japan Communist Party.

In November, he visited the house of Naoya Shiga in Nara Prefecture, and in the spring of 1932, he went underground.
On February 20, 1933, Kobayashi went to a meeting spot in Akasaka to meet with a fellow Communist Party member, who turned out to be a &quot;Tokkō&quot; spy who had infiltrated the party. The &quot;Tokkō&quot; were lying in wait for him, and although he tried to escape, he was captured and arrested. Kobayashi was taken to Tsukiji Police Station, where he was tortured. Police authorities announced the following day that Kobayashi had died of a heart attack. No hospital would perform an autopsy for fear of the &quot;Tokkō&quot;.

==Legacy==
===2008 bestseller===
In 2008, &quot;Kanikōsen&quot; became a surprise bestseller thanks to an advertising campaign linking the novel to the working poor.

===Translations===
Kobayashi&#x27;s principal works have been translated into numerous languages, including Russian, Chinese, English, Korean, Spanish, Basque, Italian, Portuguese, German, French, Polish, and Norwegian.

In 1933, &quot;The Cannery Boat and other Japanese short stories&quot; was published by the International Publishers in New York. The anonymous translator was William Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Bickerton. Because of censorship, the translation of the title text (&quot;Kanikōsen&quot;) is incomplete, comprising slightly more than half of the original. The full text of the novel did not become available in Japan until 1948.

In 1973, an English translation of Kobayashi&#x27;s two novels by Frank Motofuji under the titles &quot;The Factory Ship&quot; (&quot;Kanikōsen&quot;) and &quot;The Absentee Landlord&quot; (&quot;Fuzai jinushi&quot;) was published by the University of Tokyo Press under sponsorship from UNESCO.

In 2013, &quot;The Crab Cannery Ship and Other Novels of Struggle&quot; was published by the University of Hawaii Press. In addition to a new translation of the title text (&quot;Kanikōsen&quot;), the book includes &quot;Yasuko&quot; and &quot;Life of a Party Member&quot; (&quot;Tōseikatsusha&quot;). The introduction is by Yōichi Komori, professor of Japanese literature at Tokyo University. The translator is Željko Cipriš.

In 2013, &quot;Kani Kosen: Sebuah Revolusi&quot; was published by the Jalasutra Publisher, Indonesia as an Indonesia version of Takijis work, Kani Kosen.

&quot;The Crab Cannery Ship&quot; (&#x27;Le bateau-usine&#x27;) and &quot;The Absentee Landlord&quot; (&quot;Le propriétaire absent&quot;) were published in French in 2010 and 2017 respectively.

===Takiji Sai===
The Otaru Takiji-sai Jikko Iinkai is a coterie of Takiji Kobayashi&#x27;s admirers. They organized an 80th anniversary commemorating Kobayashi&#x27;s death in Hokkaido. Amongst those who attended the 80th anniversary was Norma Field. Katsuo Terai serves as chairman of the Takiji-sai. The larger Takiji Sai tend to be in locales that were important to Takiji&#x27;s life like Otaru, Akita, and the Greater Tokyo Suginami-Nakano-Shibuya Memorials. Takiji Sai are evening events, and feature a musical program as well as talks on Takiji&#x27;s life and works.

===&quot;Suite Slaughter&quot;===
&quot;Suite Slaughter&quot; (&quot;Kumikyoku Gyakusatsu&quot;) is a musical written by Inoue Hisashi, and depicts Kobayashi from the time he was picked up for questioning in Osaka in May 1930 till his death three years later. The play opened on 3 October 2009 at the Galaxy Theater (&quot;Ginga Gekijō&quot;) at Tennozu Isle in Tokyo. After “Suite Slaughter” closes at the Galaxy Theater on Oct. 25, it plans to travel to the Hyogo Performing Arts Center in Nishinomiya, and the Kawanishicho Friendly Plaza in Yamagata. According to &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, “Suite Slaughter” premiered successfully in its premiere in October 2009 and picked up several prestigious awards.

===Takiji Library===
A Takiji Library was established by Sano Chikara, a businessman who graduated from Kobayashi&#x27;s alma mater, Otaru University of Commerce. The Takiji Library became a centralized source of information. It sponsored the publication of ten books, including a manga version of &quot;The Cannery Ship&quot;. The Takiji Library, together with Otaru University, co-sponsored a series of international symposia. The Takiji Library, and the Otaru University for Commerce, co-sponsored an essay contest on &quot;The Cannery Ship&quot;.

===&quot;Strike the Hour, Takiji&quot;===
&quot;Strike the Hour, Takiji&quot; is a documentary film on Kobayashi&#x27;s life. It was released in 2005.

===Otaru Literary Museum===
The Otaru Literary Museum features several Japanese writers, including Takiji Kobayashi. Takiji&#x27;s bronze death mask is located in the Otaru Literary Museum. Tamagawa Kaoru, the curator of the museum, states that the museum has had a bump in attendance from the “Kani kosen boom”.

===Tourism===
The &quot;Kani kosen boom&quot; has brought a tangible excitement to Otaru city, a city that boasts Takiji Kobayashi&#x27;s grave and has a compelling claim to be his hometown. There are books that describe Takiji “literary walks” for fans to retrace places of significance to Takiji Kobayashi. As a result of the “Kani kosen boom”, there is also a Japan Tourist Bureau bus tour. The tour starts at the Otaru Literary Museum, a museum that features Takiji, and other Japanese writers. The bus then tours around Otaru, and makes a special visit to the gravesite of Takiji Kobayashi.

===Takiji Kobayashi Literary Monument===

On October 9, 1965, the Takiji Kobayashi Literary Monument was unveiled. The unveiling was held at the Asahi observatory overlooking Otaru City. The monument was built by Japanese sculptor Hongo Shin.

In 1903, Sakai established the socialist organization &quot;Heiminsha,&quot; together with Shūsui Kōtoku and Uchimura Kanzō. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, &quot;Yorozu Morning News&quot; adopted a pro-government stance, and Sakai quit to form the weekly &quot;Heimin Shimbun&quot; together with Shūsui Kōtoku, which was critical of the war and decried the high taxes which the war was causing. It also published a Japanese translation of the Communist Manifesto in its November 13, 1904, issue. Sakai was sentenced to two months in jail. Sakai was also a strong supporter of the Esperanto movement, helping create the Japana Esperanto-Instituto in 1906.
