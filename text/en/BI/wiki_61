<text>Royal Mail Group Limited, trading as Royal Mail, is a British postal service and courier company. It is owned by International Distribution Services. It operates the brands Royal Mail (letters and parcels) and Parcelforce Worldwide (parcels). Formed in 2001, the company used the name Consignia for a brief period but changed it soon afterwards. Prior to this date, Royal Mail and Parcelforce were (along with Post Office Counters Ltd) part of the Post Office, a UK state-owned enterprise the history of which is summarised below. Long before it came to be a company name, the &#x27;Royal Mail&#x27; brand had been used by the General Post Office to identify its distribution network (which over the centuries included horse-drawn mail coaches, horse carts and hand carts, ships, trains, vans, motorcycle combinations and aircraft).

The company provides mail collection and delivery services throughout the UK. Letters and parcels are deposited in post or parcel boxes, or are collected in bulk from businesses and transported to Royal Mail sorting offices. Royal Mail owns and maintains the UK&#x27;s distinctive and iconic red pillar boxes, first introduced in 1852 (12 years after the first postage stamp, Penny Black), and other post boxes, many of which bear the royal cypher of the reigning monarch at the date of manufacture. Deliveries are made at least once every day except Sundays and bank holidays at uniform charges for all UK destinations. Royal Mail generally aims to make first class deliveries the next business day throughout the nation.

For most of its history, the Royal Mail was a public service, operating as a government department or public corporation. Following the Postal Services Act 2011, Royal Mail Group Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of a new holding company, Royal Mail plc; a majority of the shares in Royal Mail plc were floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2013. Nine years later Royal Mail plc was renamed: it is now known as International Distribution Services (of which Royal Mail Group Limited remains a wholly-owned subsidiary).

==History==

The Royal Mail can trace its history back to 1516, when Henry VIII established a &quot;Master of the Posts&quot;, a position that was renamed &quot;Postmaster General&quot; in 1710.

Upon his accession to the throne of England at the Union of the Crowns in 1603, James VI moved his court to London. One of his first acts from London was to establish the royal postal service between London and Edinburgh, in an attempt to retain control over the Scottish Privy Council.

===Government office===
The Royal Mail service was first made available to the public by Charles I on 31 July 1635, with postage being paid by the recipient. The monopoly was to Thomas Witherings.

In the 1640s, Parliament removed the monopoly from Witherings and during the Civil War and First Commonwealth the parliamentary postal service was run at great profit for himself by Edmund Prideaux (a prominent parliamentarian and lawyer who rose to be attorney-general). To keep his monopoly in those troubled times Prideaux improved efficiency and used both legal impediments and illegal methods.

In 1653, Parliament set aside all previous grants for postal services, and contracts were let for the inland and foreign mails to John Manley. Manley was given a monopoly on the postal service, which was effectively enforced by Protector Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s government, and thanks to the improvements necessitated by the war, Manley ran a much-improved Post Office service. In July 1655, the Post Office was put under the direct government control of John Thurloe, a Secretary of State, best known to history as Cromwell&#x27;s spymaster general. Previous English governments had tried to prevent conspirators from communicating; Thurloe preferred to deliver their post having surreptitiously read it. As the Protectorate claimed to govern all of Great Britain and Ireland under one unified government, on 9 June 1657 the Second Protectorate Parliament (which included Scottish and Irish MPs) passed the &quot;Act for settling the Postage in England, Scotland and Ireland&quot;, which created one monopoly Post Office for the whole territory of the Commonwealth. The first Postmaster General was appointed in 1661, and a seal was first fixed to the mail.
At the restoration of the monarchy, in 1660, all the ordinances and acts passed by parliaments during the Civil War and the Interregnum passed into oblivion, so the General Post Office (GPO) was officially established by Charles II under the (12 Cha. 2. c. 35).

Between 1719 and 1763, Ralph Allen, postmaster at Bath, signed a series of contracts with the post office to develop and expand Britain&#x27;s postal network. He organised mail coaches which were provided by both Wilson &amp; Company of London and Williams &amp; Company of Bath. The early Royal Mail Coaches were similar to ordinary family coaches, but with Post Office livery.

The first mail coach ran in 1784, operating between Bristol and London. Delivery staff received uniforms for the first time in 1793, and the Post Office Investigation Branch was established. The first mail train ran in 1830, on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The Post Office&#x27;s money order system was introduced in 1838.

====Uniform penny postage====
In December 1839, the first substantial reform started when postage rates were revised by the short-lived Uniform Fourpenny Post.

Rowland Hill, an English teacher, inventor and social reformer, became disillusioned with the postal service, and wrote a paper proposing reforms that resulted in an approach that would go on to change not only the Royal Mail, but also be copied by postal services around the world. His proposal was refused at the first attempt, but he overcame the political obstacles, and was appointed to implement and develop his ideas. He realised that many small purchases would fund the organisation and implemented this by changing it from a receiver-pays to a sender-pays system. This was used as the model for other postal services around the world, but also spilled over to the modern-day crowd-funding approach.

Greater changes took place when the Uniform Penny Post was introduced on 10 January 1840, whereby a single rate for delivery anywhere in Great Britain and Ireland was pre-paid by the sender. A few months later, to certify that postage had been paid on a letter, the sender could affix the first adhesive postage stamp, the Penny Black, which was available for use from 6 May the same year. Other innovations were the introduction of pre-paid William Mulready designed postal stationery letter sheets and envelopes.

As Britain was the first country to issue prepaid postage stamps, British stamps are the only stamps that do not bear the name of the country of issue on them.

By the late 19th century, there were between six and twelve mail deliveries per day in London, permitting correspondents to exchange multiple letters within a single day.

The first trial of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company was made in 1863, sending mail by underground rail between postal depots. The Post Office began its telegraph service in 1870.

====Pillar boxes====
The first Post Office pillar box was erected in 1852 in Jersey. Pillar boxes were introduced in mainland Britain the following year. British pillar boxes traditionally carry the Latin initials of the reigning monarch at the time of their installation, for example: &quot;VR&quot; for &quot;Victoria Regina&quot; or &quot;GR&quot; for &quot;Georgius Rex&quot;. Such branding was not used in Scotland for most of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, due to a dispute over the monarch&#x27;s title: some Scottish nationalists argue that Queen Elizabeth II should have simply been Queen Elizabeth, as there had been no previous Queen Elizabeth of Scotland or of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Elizabeth I was only Queen of the pre-1707 Kingdom of England). The dispute involved vandalism and attacks on pillar and post boxes introduced in Scotland which displayed EIIR. To avoid the issue, pillar boxes in Scotland were either marked &#x27;Post Office&#x27; or used the Scots Crown.

A national telephone service was opened by the Post Office in 1912. In 1919, the first international airmail service was developed by Royal Engineers (Postal Section) and Royal Air Force. The London Post Office Railway was opened in 1927.

In 1941, an airgraph service was introduced between UK and Egypt. The service was later extended to Canada (1941), East Africa (1941), Burma (1942), India (1942), South Africa (1942), Australia (1943), New Zealand (1943) Ceylon (1944) and Italy (1944).

Postcodes were extended across Great Britain and Northern Ireland between 1959 and 1974. The two-class postal system was introduced in 1968, using first-class and second-class services. The Post Office opened the National Giro Bank that year.

===Statutory corporation===
Under the Post Office Act 1969 the General Post Office was changed from a government department to a statutory corporation, known simply as the Post Office. The office of Postmaster General was abolished and replaced with the positions of chairman and chief executive in the new company. In 1971, postal services in Great Britain were suspended for two months between January and March as the result of a national postal strike over a pay claim. 

British Telecom was separated from the Post Office in 1980, and emerged as an independent business in 1981. In 1986 the Post Office was subdivided into four businesses: Royal Mail Letters, Royal Mail Parcels, Post Office Counters and the National Girobank. Girobank was sold to Alliance &amp; Leicester in 1990, but the remaining business continued under public ownership as privatisation of this was deemed to be too unpopular. That same year, Royal Mail Parcels was rebranded as Parcelforce as part of an attempt to compete with international courier firms, which were fast expanding into the European market. 

Postal workers held their first national strike for 17 years in 1988, after walking out over bonuses being paid to recruit new workers in London and the South East. Royal Mail established Romec (Royal Mail Engineering &amp; Construction) in 1989 to deliver facilities maintenance services to its business. Romec was 51% owned by Royal Mail, and 49% by Haden Building Management Ltd, which became Balfour Beatty WorkPlace and is now Cofely UK, part of GDF Suez in a joint venture.

In the 1990s the President of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, began to look again at privatisation, and eventually a Green Paper on Postal Reform was published in May 1994, outlining various possible options. The ideas, however, proved controversial, and were dropped from the 1994 Queen&#x27;s Speech after a number of Conservative MPs warned Heseltine that they would not vote for the legislation.

In 1998, Royal Mail launched RelayOne as an email to postal service system. In 1999, Royal Mail launched a short-lived e-commerce venture, ViaCode Limited, aimed at providing encrypted online communications services. However, it failed to make a profit and closed in 2002.

In 1999 Royal Mail acquired German Parcel, incorporating it into a newly-formed holding company, General Logistics Systems B.V., which over the next few years was used to establish an international network of parcel couriers (&#x27;through acquisitions and the founding of companies in numerous countries&#x27;). In 2002 the GLS brand was launched, which later went on to function as Royal Mail&#x27;s European parcels business.

====Headquarters====
The Post Office had its headquarters in St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand, in the City of London, until 1984. Then the headquarters division moved out to 33 Grosvenor Place (lately vacated by British Steel). After 1986 separate headquarters were established elsewhere for each of the three subdivisions of the Post Office, leaving a much reduced corporate head office (with just thirty staff) who in 1990 moved to 30 St James&#x27;s Square; two years later it was again moved, to be co-located with the Letters head office in Royal Mail House (148 Old Street).

===Public limited company===
After a change of government in 1997, the Labour government decided to keep the Post Office state-owned, but with more commercial freedom. This led to the Postal Services Act 2000, whereby the Post Office became a public limited company in which the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry owned a special share, and the Treasury Solicitor held a ordinary share. 

====Consignia plc====
The company was renamed Consignia Public Limited Company in 2001, a name that was invented by the consultancy company Dragon Brands, and the new name was intended to show that the company did more than deliver mail; however, the change was very unpopular with both the general public and employees. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) boycotted the name, and the following year, it was announced that the company would be renamed Royal Mail Group plc. 

====Royal Mail Group plc====
The company began operating under its &#x27;new&#x27; name, Royal Mail Group plc, on 4 November 2002. Use of the Post Office brand was afterwards restricted to the counters business (&#x27;Post Office Counters Ltd&#x27; since 1987), which was duly renamed Post Office Limited; it continued to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Mail Group plc until 2012, when the two were separated in preparation for the latter&#x27;s privatisation. 

In 2004, the second daily delivery was scrapped in an effort to reduce costs and improve efficiency, meaning a later single delivery would be made. The same year, the travelling post office mail trains were also axed. In 2005, Royal Mail signed a contract with GB Railfreight to operate an overnight rail service between London and Scotland (carrying bulk mail, and without any on-train sorting); this was later followed by a London-Newcastle service.
On 1 January 2006, the Royal Mail lost its 350-year monopoly, and the British postal market became fully open to competition. Competitors were allowed to collect and sort mail, and pass it to Royal Mail for delivery, a service known as downstream access. Royal Mail introduced Pricing in Proportion (PiP) for first and second class inland mail, whereby prices are affected by the size as well as weight of items. It also introduced an online postage service, allowing customers to pay for postage online.

====Royal Mail Group Ltd====
In 2007, the Royal Mail Group plc became Royal Mail Group Ltd, in a slight change of legal status. Royal Mail ended Sunday collections from pillar boxes that year.

On 1 October 2008, Postwatch was merged into the new consumer watchdog Consumer Focus.

In 2008, due to a continuing fall in mail volumes, the government commissioned an independent review of the postal services sector by Richard Hooper CBE, the former deputy chairman of Ofcom. The recommendations in the Hooper Review led Business Secretary Lord Mandelson to seek to part privatise the company by selling a minority stake to a commercial partner. However, despite legislation for the sale passing the House of Lords, it was abandoned in the House of Commons after strong opposition from backbench Labour MPs. The government later cited the difficult economic conditions for the reason behind the retreat.

After the departure of Adam Crozier to ITV plc on 27 May 2010, Royal Mail appointed Canadian Moya Greene as chief executive, the first woman to hold the post.

On 6 December 2010, a number of paid-for services including Admail, post office boxes and private post boxes were removed from the Inland Letter Post Scheme (ILPS) and became available under contract. Several free services, including petitions to parliament and the sovereign, and poste restante, were removed from the scheme.

===Privatisation===
A new holding company, Royal Mail plc, was established in September 2013, in anticipation of its initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. Applications for members of the public to buy shares opened on 27 September 2013, ahead of the company&#x27;s listing on the London Stock Exchange on 15 October 2013. Trading as Royal Mail, and continuing to serve as the UK&#x27;s designated Universal Service Provider, the company operated through two divisions: UKPIL (UK Parcels, International &amp; Letters) &#x27;Royal Mail&#x27;s core UK and international parcels and letter delivery businesses under the Royal Mail and Pacelforce Worldwide brands&#x27; and GLS (General Logistics Systems) &#x27;the Group&#x27;s European parcels business&#x27;; (between 2016 and 2020, GLS would expand beyond Europe and into North America). Throughout this time, Royal Mail Group Limited continued to operate as a &#x27;wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Mail plc&#x27;, running the UKPIL side of the operation.

During its annual general meeting on 20 July 2022, the company announced that the holding company responsible for both Royal Mail and GLS would change its name to International Distributions Services plc. It was also suggested that the board of directors may look to separate GLS in order to distance the profitable company from Royal Mail, which were in negotiations with the CWU over both pay and future changes to ways of working. The name change was filled in the Companies House on 28 September 2022 and registered on 3 October. In March 2023, talks over pay were reportedly at collapse.

Royal Mail Group Ltd continues to function as a wholly-owned subsidiary: &#x27;The Company makes up a significant part of the Royal Mail UK segment (&#x27;Royal Mail&#x27;) within the IDS plc Group&#x27;, running parcels and letter delivery businesses under the Royal Mail and Parcelforce Worldwide brands.

==Services==
===Universal service===
Royal Mail is required by law to maintain the universal service, whereby items of a specific size can be sent to any location within the United Kingdom for a fixed price, not affected by distance. The Postal Services Act 2011 guaranteed that Royal Mail would continue to provide the universal service until at least 2021.

On 20 January 2025, Royal Mail announced that it is expected to be permitted to discontinue Saturday deliveries for second-class letters under proposals put forward by Ofcom. The plans also include a reduction in postal delivery targets.The postal and communications regulator has proposed that second-class letter deliveries operate on alternate weekdays while maintaining first-class letter deliveries six days a week.

===Special Delivery===
Royal Mail Special Delivery is an expedited mail service that guarantees delivery by 1 p.m. or 9 a.m. the next day for an increased cost. In the event that the item does not arrive on time, there is a money back guarantee. It insures goods to the value of £50 for 9 a.m. or £750 for 1 p.m. An extra fee can be paid to extend the insurance coverage to up to £2,500 (for either service).

===Business services===

The Royal Mail runs, alongside its stamped mail services, another sector of post called business mail. The large majority of Royal Mail&#x27;s business mail service is for PPI or franked mail, where the sender prints their own &#x27;stamp&#x27;. For PPI mail, this involves either a simple rubber stamp and an ink pad, or a printed label. For franked mail, a dedicated franking machine is used.

Bulk business mail, using Mailmark technology, attracts reduced prices of up to 32%, if the sender prints an RM4SCC barcode, or prints the address formatted in a specific way in a font readable by RM optical character recognition (OCR) equipment.

===Prohibited goods===
Royal Mail will not carry a number of items which it says could be dangerous for its staff or vehicles. Additionally, a list of &#x27;restricted&#x27; items can be posted subject to conditions. Prohibited goods include alcoholic, corrosive or flammable liquids or solids, gases, controlled drugs, indecent or offensive materials, and human and animal remains.

In 2004, Royal Mail applied to the then postal regulator Postcomm to ban the carriage of sporting firearms, saying they caused disruption to the network, that a ban would assist police with firearms control, and that ease of access meant the letters network was a target of criminals. Postcomm issued a consultation on the proposed changes in December 2004, to which 62 people and organisations responded.

In June 2005, Postcomm decided to refuse the application on the grounds that Royal Mail had not provided sufficient evidence that carrying firearms caused undue disruption or that a ban would reduce the number of illegal weapons. It also said that a ban would cause unnecessary hardship to individuals and businesses.

In August 2012, Royal Mail again attempted to prohibit the carriage of all firearms, air rifles and air pistols from 30 November 2012. It cited section 14(1) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 (c. 45), which requires carriers of firearms to &quot;take reasonable precautions&quot; for their safe custody and argued that to comply would involve disproportionate cost. A Royal Mail public consultation document on the changes said: &quot;We expect the impact on customers to be minimal&quot;.

The proposals provoked a large negative response, following a campaign led by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, backed by numerous shooting-related websites and organisations. A total of 1,458 people gave their views in emails and letters sent to Royal Mail. An online petition opposing the proposals was signed by 2,236 people, 1,742 of whom added comments. In the face of such opposition, Royal Mail dropped the proposals in December 2012.

===Unaddressed promotional mail delivery===
Royal Mail&#x27;s &quot;Door to door&quot; service provides delivery of leaflets, brochures, catalogues and other print materials to groups of domestic and business addresses selected by postcode. Such deliveries are made by the mail carrier together as part of the daily round. Companies using the &quot;Door to door&quot; service include Virgin Media, BT, Sky, Talk Talk, Farmfoods, Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Direct Line and Morrisons. In 2005, the service delivered 3.3 billion items.

The &quot;Door to door&quot; service does not use the UK Mailing Preference Service; instead, Royal Mail operates its own opt-out database. Warnings about missing government communications given by Royal Mail to customers opting out of their service have been criticised by customers and consumer groups. Clarification given by the company in June 2015 explained that election communications and unaddressed government mail would be delivered to customers even if they had opted out.

==Staffing==
As of 2019, Royal Mail employed around 162,000 permanent postal workers, of which 143,000 were UK based roles, and 90,000 were postmen and women. An additional 18,000 casual workers were employed during November and December to assist with the additional Christmas post.

In 2011, Royal Mail established an in-house agency, Angard Staffing Solutions, to recruit temporary workers. Royal Mail was accused of trying to circumvent the Agency Workers Regulations, but denied this, saying they only wanted to reduce recruitment costs. In January 2012 it was reported that Angard had failed to pay a number of workers for several weeks.

Royal Mail&#x27;s industrial disputes include a seven-week strike in 1971 after a dispute over pay and another strike in 1988 due to bonuses being paid to new staff recruited in London and the South East.

Royal Mail suffered national wildcat strikes over pay and conditions in 2003. In Autumn 2007, disputes over modernisation began to escalate into industrial action. In mid October the CWU and Royal Mail agreed a resolution to the dispute.

In December 2008, workers at mail centres affected by proposals to rationalise the number of mail centres (particularly in north west England) again voted for strike action, potentially affecting Christmas deliveries. The action was postponed less than 24 hours before staff were due to walk out.

Localised strikes took place across the UK from June 2009 and grew in frequency throughout the summer. In September 2009 the CWU opened a national ballot for industrial action over Royal Mail&#x27;s failure to reach a national agreement covering protection of jobs, pay, terms and conditions and the cessation of managerial executive action. The ballot was passed in October, causing a number of two- and three-day strikes.

There were several strikes in 2022. They ended in July 2023 after workers agreed to a three-year pay deal. Seventy-six per cent of union members voted in favour of the agreement, which included a ten per cent salary increase and a one-off lump sum of five-hundred pounds, in a ballot with a sixty-seven per cent turnout.

Royal Mail Group have lost 59 employment tribunals since 2017

On 28 December 2024, the UK&#x27;s longest serving postman, Robert Hudson, retired at the age of 76, after 60 years&#x27; service.

===Penny Post Credit Union===

Penny Post Credit Union Limited is a savings and loans co-operative established by a joint project with the CWU in 1996, as Royal Mail Wolverhampton and District Employees Credit Union, it became Royal Mail (West) Credit Union in 2000, before adopting the present name in 2001. Based at the North West Midlands Mail Centre, it is a member of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited.

The credit union is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the PRA. Ultimately, like the banks and building societies, members&#x27; savings are protected against business failure by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

==Regulation==
As part of the 2000 Act, the government set up a postal regulator, the Postal Services Commission, known as Postcomm, which offered licences to private companies to deliver mail. In 2001, the Consumer Council for Postal Services, known as Postwatch, was created for consumers to express any concerns they may have with the postal service in Britain. Postwatch was abolished in 2008 and merged with Energywatch to form Consumer Focus, with Postcomm also being abolished in 2011.

The Royal Mail is now regulated by Ofcom, while consumer interests are represented by the Citizens Advice Bureau. The relationship between the two bodies&#x27; predecessors (Postcomm and Postwatch) was not always good, and in 2005, Postwatch took Postcomm to judicial review over its decision regarding rebates to late-paying customers.

Royal Mail has, in some quarters, a poor reputation for losing mail despite its claims that more than 99.93% of mail arrives safely and in 2006 was fined £11.7 million due to the amount of mail lost, stolen or damaged. In the first three months of 2011, around 120,000 letters were lost.

In July 2012 Ofcom consulted on a scheme proposed by Royal Mail to alter its delivery obligations to allow larger postal items to be left with neighbours rather than returning them to a Royal Mail office to await collection. The scheme was presented as offering consumers greater choice for receiving mail when not at home, that is if Royal Mail deliver items as per their stated contractual obligations and was said to follow Royal Mail research from a &#x27;delivery to neighbour&#x27; trial across six areas of the UK that showed widespread consumer satisfaction. In a statement dated 27 September 2012, Ofcom announced it would approve the scheme after noting that more goods were being purchased over the internet and that Royal Mail&#x27;s competitors were permitted to leave undelivered items with neighbours. People who do not wish to have parcels left with neighbours, or to receive those of others, can opt out by displaying a free opt-out sticker near their letterbox. Royal Mail remains liable for undeliverable items until they are received by the addressee or returned to sender.

Ofcom suggested in October 2012 that the first and second class post systems could be replaced by a single class. The new class would be set at a higher price than the current second class, but would be delivered in a shorter time-frame.

Royal Mail was fined £50 million by Ofcom in 2018 for breach of European Union competition law. Ofcom found that Royal Mail had abused its dominant position in 2014 in the delivery of letters.

As of December 2023, Royal Mail has been fined a total of £58,303,936 for regulatory breaches according to the Violation Tracker UK website.

==Operations==
The targets are delivering 93% of First Class post the next working day, and delivering 98.5% of Second Class post within three working days.

===Mail centres===
Royal Mail operates a network of 37 mail centres (as of 2019). Each mail centre serves a large geographically defined area of the UK and together they form the backbone network of the mail distribution operation. Mail is collected and brought to one of the mail centres. Mail is exchanged between the mail centres and then forwarded to one of 1,356 delivery offices, from where the final delivery is made.

Mail from third-party &quot;downstream access&quot; providers is also brought to the mail centres for Royal Mail to carry out the final delivery. Ofcom restricts the prices at which Royal Mail sell this downstream access to third-party companies.

As part of the sorting process, mail is collected from pillar boxes, Post Office branches and businesses, and brought to the regional mail centre. The process is divided into two parts. The &#x27;outward&#x27; sorting identifies mail for delivery in the mail centre geographic area, which is retained, and mail intended for other mail centres, which is dispatched. The &#x27;inward&#x27; sorting forwards mail received from other centres to the relevant delivery offices within the mail centre area.

====Integrated mail processing====
Integrated mail processing (IMP) is the method that Royal Mail uses to sort the mail (in bulk) before delivery and has been implementing the technology since 1999. The system works by automated optical character recognition of postcodes. Integrated mail processors scan the front and back of an envelope and translate addresses into machine-readable code. Letters are given a fluorescent orange barcode that represents the address. The barcode follows the RM4SCC pattern. Per mail item there are over 250 types of information that are collected from mail class to indicia type. Some scanning and detection features have been removed as they have been superseded by newer technology. This is known as the IMP Extension of Life (EoL) program.

====Intelligent letter sorting machines====
Royal Mail operates 66 intelligent letter sorting machines (ILSMs) in the UK, which were installed in the mid-1980s and early 1990s to improve the speed and efficiency of sorting and delivering mail. These process more than 36,000 items per hour and were part of their ongoing modernisation programme that commenced in the early 1980s.

====International mail====
Royal Mail operates an international-mail sorting centre, in Langley, Berkshire close to Heathrow Airport, called the Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre, which handles all international airmail arriving into and leaving the United Kingdom, plus some container- and road-transported mail.

====List of mail centres====
, the [39] operational mail centres (divided into Royal Mail regions) were:
* East [7]: Chelmsford, Norwich, Nottingham, Peterborough, Romford, Sheffield, South Midlands (Northampton)
* West [6]: Birmingham, Chester, Manchester, North West Midlands (Wolverhampton), Preston, Warrington
* South East [7]: Croydon, Gatwick (Crawley), Greenford, Home Counties North (Hemel Hempstead), Jubilee (Hounslow), Medway (Rochester), London Central (Mount Pleasant)
* South West [11]: Bristol, Cardiff, Dorset (Poole), Exeter, Gloucester, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Southampton, Swansea, Swindon, Truro
* North [8]: Aberdeen, Inverness, Carlisle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Northern Ireland (Newtownabbey), Tyneside/Newcastle (Gateshead)

Mail Centres in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey are streamlined into the Royal Mail&#x27;s domestic network.

====Closures====
The number of mail centres has been declining as part of the Mail Centre Rationalisation Programme. In 2008, there were 69 mail centres and in 2010 there were 64. It was anticipated that around half of these could be closed by 2016. Oldham and Stockport along with Oxford and Reading mail centres all closed in 2009 and Bolton, Crewe, Liverpool, Northampton, Coventry and Milton Keynes were closed in 2010. Farnborough, Watford and Stevenage were closed in 2011. Hemel Hempstead, Southend, Worcester were closed in 2012. Dartford, Tonbridge, Maidstone and Canterbury were closed in 2012 but replaced by a new mail centre in Rochester. The East London and South London mail centres were closed during summer 2012.

In 2013 and 2014, a further eight mail centres were planned to be closed. The old mail centres in Northampton, Coventry and Milton Keynes were replaced with the new South Midlands mail centre in Northampton covering Warwickshire, Coventry, Northamptonshire and Milton Keynes. The South Midlands Mail Centre is the largest in the UK.

=== Regional Distribution Centres ===
As of 2020 there are seven Regional Distribution Centres (RDCs) across the country. They are responsible for handling large pre-sorted mailings from business customers.
*Scottish Distribution Centre (Wishaw)
*Princess Royal Distribution Centre (London)
*National Distribution Centre (Northampton)
*South West Distribution Centre (Bristol)
*North West Distribution Centre (Warrington)
*Yorkshire Distribution Centre (Normanton)
*Northern Ireland Distribution Centre (Newtownabbey)

Royal Mail is famous for its custom load-carrying bicycles (with the rack and basket built into the frame), made by Pashley Cycles since 1971. Since 2000, old delivery bicycles have been shipped to Africa by the charity Re~Cycle; over 8,000 had been donated by 2004. In 2009, Royal Mail announced it was beginning to phase out bicycle deliveries, to be replaced with more push-trolleys and vans. A spokesman said that they would continue to use bicycles on some rural routes, and that there was no plan to phase out bicycles completely.

In addition to running a large number of road vehicles, Royal Mail uses trains, a ship and some aircraft, with an air hub at East Midlands Airport. Dedicated night mail flights are operated by Titan Airways for Royal Mail between East Midlands Airport and Bournemouth Airport and between Exeter International Airport and London Stansted Airport. One Boeing 737-3Y0 was flown in full Royal Mail livery. In June 2013, Royal Mail confirmed it would extend Titan Airways&#x27; contract to operate night flights from Stansted Airport, from January 2014 to January 2017, introducing new routes to Edinburgh and Belfast using three Boeing 737s. The new contract called for the replacement of the British Aerospace 146-200QC (Quick Change) aircraft in favour of a standard Boeing 737 fleet, and the type was withdrawn by Titan Airways in November 2013.

In 2021 Royal Mail announced plans to trial using a drone between the UK mainland and St Mary&#x27;s airport, Isles of Scilly. The twin-engine vehicle is manufactured in the UK by the Windracers and is capable of carrying 100 kg of mail, which is the same weight as a typical delivery round. It is able to fly in poor weather conditions, including fog, and will be out of sight of any operator during the 70-mile journey. Vertical take-off and landing drones will take parcels between the islands in the archipelago. Royal Mail delivered its first parcel using a drone in December 2020 when a package was sent to a remote lighthouse on Scotland&#x27;s Isle of Mull. In Scotland, it partnered with Skyports for postal services using drones.

The RMS &quot;St. Helena&quot; was a cargo and passenger ship that served the British overseas territory of Saint Helena. It sailed between Cape Town, Saint Helena and Ascension Island. It was one of only two Royal Mail Ships in service, alongside the Queen Mary 2, although it did not belong to Royal Mail Group.

Royal Mail operated the London Post Office Railway, a network of driverless trains running on a private underground track, from 1927 until it closed it in 2003.

==British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies==
British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies have their own independent postal systems. (See List of postal entities.) Though served by independent operators, the three Crown Dependencies use British postcodes in co-operation with Royal Mail; each dependency has its own postal area. The same prices are charged by the four operators for delivery throughout their collective area, though delivery times vary, and UK mail to the Channel Islands must clear customs.

==Arms==
When the Post Office ceased to be a government department, it was given its own coat of arms (issued in 1970), which incorporated colours associated with the Royal Mail (red) and Post Office Telecommunications (yellow): the latter being represented in particular by a &quot;barrulet wavy or&quot; traversing both the red shield and the red collars (worn by the pegasus supporters). A phoenix crest alluded to the new corporation having been born out of its predecessor (the GPO); the caduceus in its beak stood for swift communications.

Just over ten years later, after British Telecom was separated from the Post Office, a new grant of arms was made: the telecommunications references were removed from the blazon, with the &quot;barrulet wavy&quot; being replaced by gold bezants (to represent the Girobank, whose colour (blue) was also introduced). The phoenix was also replaced, by a lion.

These arms were registered as a trademark in 1986, and are currently owned by Royal Mail Group Limited.

<doc id="349829" wikidata="Q4774533" url="?curid=349829" title="Antibacterial soap">
<text>Antibacterial soap is a soap which contains chemical ingredients that purportedly assist in killing bacteria. The majority of antibacterial soaps contain triclosan, though other chemical additives are also common. The effectiveness of products branded as being antibacterial has been disputed by some academics as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

==History==
The earliest antibacterial soap was carbolic soap, which used up to 5% phenols (carbolic acid). Fears about the safety of carbolic soaps chemical components on the skin brought about a ban on some of these chemical components.Triclosan and other antibacterial agents have long been used in commercial cleaning products for hospitals and other healthcare settings, however they began to be used in home cleaning products during the 1990s.

==Ingredients==
Triclosan and triclocarban are the most common compounds used as antibacterials in soaps. However, other common antibacterial ingredients in soaps include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol.

==Effectiveness==
Claims that antibacterial soap is effective stem from the long-standing knowledge that triclosan can inhibit the growth of various bacteria, as well as some fungi. However, more recent reviews have suggested that antibacterial soaps are no better than regular soaps at preventing illness or reducing bacteria on the hands of users.

In September 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the use of the common antibacterial ingredients triclosan and triclocarban, and 17 other ingredients frequently used in &quot;antibacterial&quot; soaps and washes, due to insufficient information on the long-term health effects of their use and a lack of evidence on their effectiveness. The FDA stated &quot;There is no data demonstrating that over-the-counter antibacterial soaps are better at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water&quot;. The agency also asserted that despite requests for such information, the FDA did not receive sufficient data from manufacturers on the long-term health effects of these chemicals. This ban does not apply to hand sanitizer. This is due to the fact that hand sanitizer typically utilizes alcohol
to kill microbes rather than triclosan or similar ingredients.

A 2017 statement by 200 scientists and medics published in the scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives warns that anti-bacterial soaps and gels are useless and may cause harm. The statement also cautioned against the use of antimicrobial agents in food contact materials, textiles, and paints. British firm Unilever claimed in 2017 to be phasing triclosan and triclocarban out of their products by the end of the year, adding they would be replaced by “a range of alternatives, including natural and nature-inspired antibacterial ingredients”.

Claims have been made in the media that antibacterial soap is more effective than plain soap in the prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration both recommend plain soap; there is no evidence that antibacterial soaps are any better, and limited evidence that they might be worse long-term.

<doc id="349831" wikidata="Q2106237" url="?curid=349831" title="Postmillennialism">
<text>In Christian eschatology (end-times theology), postmillennialism, or postmillenarianism, is an interpretation of chapter 20 of the Book of Revelation which sees Christ&#x27;s second coming as occurring &quot;after&quot; (Latin &quot;post-&quot;) the &quot;Millennium&quot;, a messianic age in which Christian ethics prosper. The term subsumes several similar views of the end times, and it stands in contrast to premillennialism and, to a lesser extent, amillennialism (see Summary of Christian eschatological differences).

Postmillennialism holds that Jesus Christ establishes his kingdom on earth through his preaching and redemptive work in the first century and that he equips his church with the gospel, empowers the church by the Spirit, and charges the church with the Great Commission (Matt 28:19) to disciple all nations. Postmillennialism expects that eventually the vast majority of people living will be saved. Increasing gospel success will gradually produce a time in history prior to Christ&#x27;s return in which faith, righteousness, peace, and prosperity will prevail in the affairs of men and of nations. After an extensive era of such conditions Jesus Christ will return visibly, bodily, and gloriously, to end history with the general resurrection and the final judgment after which the eternal order follows.

Postmillennialism was a dominant theological belief among American Protestants who promoted reform movements in the 19th and 20th centuries such as abolitionism and the Social Gospel. Postmillennialism has become one of the key tenets of a movement known as Christian reconstructionism. It has been criticized by 20th century religious conservatives as an attempt to immanentize the eschaton.

==Background==
The Savoy Declaration of 1658 contains one of the earliest creedal statements of a postmillennial eschatology:

As the Lord in his care and love towards his Church, hath in his infinite wise providence exercised it with great variety in all ages, for the good of them that love him, and his own glory; so according to his promise, we expect that in the latter days, antichrist being destroyed, the Jews called, and the adversaries of the kingdom of his dear Son broken, the churches of Christ being enlarged, and edified through a free and plentiful communication of light and grace, shall enjoy in this world a more quiet, peaceable and glorious condition than they have enjoyed.

John Jefferson Davis notes that the postmillennial outlook was articulated by men like John Owen in the 17th century, Jonathan Edwards in the 18th century, and Charles Hodge in the 19th century. Davis argues that it was the dominant view in the nineteenth century, but was eclipsed by the other millennial positions by the end of World War I due to the &quot;pessimism and disillusionment engendered by wartime conditions.&quot;

==Reforms==
George M. Fredrickson argues, &quot;The belief that a religious revival and the resulting improvement in human faith and morals would eventually usher in a thousand years of peace and justice antecedent to the Second Coming of Christ was an impetus to the promotion of Progressive reforms, as historians have frequently pointed out.&quot; During the Second Great Awakening of the 1830s, some divines expected the millennium to arrive in a few years. By the 1840s, however, the great day had receded to the distant future, and post-millennialism became the religious dimension of the broader American middle-class ideology of steady moral and material progress.

==Key ideas==
Although some postmillennialists hold to a literal millennium of 1,000 years, other postmillennialists see the thousand years more as a figurative term for a long period of time (similar in that respect to amillennialism). Among those holding to a non-literal &quot;millennium&quot; it is usually understood to have already begun, which implies a less obvious and less dramatic kind of millennium than that typically envisioned by premillennialists, as well as a more unexpected return of Christ.

Postmillennialism also teaches that the forces of Satan will gradually be defeated by the expansion of the Kingdom of God throughout history up until the second coming of Christ. This belief that good will gradually triumph over evil has led proponents of postmillennialism to label themselves &quot;optimillennialists&quot; in contrast to &quot;pessimillennial&quot; premillennialists and amillennialists.

Many postmillennialists also adopt some form of preterism, which holds that many of the end times prophecies in the Bible have already been fulfilled. Several key postmillennialists, however, did not adopt preterism with respect to the Book of Revelation, among them B. B. Warfield and Francis Nigel Lee. 

Other postmillennialists hold to the idealist position of Revelation. The book titled &quot;An A-to-Z Guide to Biblical Prophecy and the End Times&quot; defines Idealism as &quot;A symbolic description of the on going battle between God and evil.&quot; Those who hold to this view include: R. J. Rushdoony and P. Andrew Sandlin.

==Types==

===Difference in extent===

Postmillennialists diverge on the extent of the gospel&#x27;s conquest. The majority of postmillennialists do believe in an apostasy, and like B. B. Warfield, believe the apostasy refers to the Jewish people&#x27;s rejection of Christianity either during the first century or possibly until the return of Christ at the end of the millennium. This postmillennial perspective essentially dovetails with the thinking of amillennial and premillennial schools of eschatology.

There is a minority of postmillennial scholars, however, who discount the idea of a final apostasy, regarding the gospel conquest ignited by the Great Commission to be total and absolute, such that no unsaved individuals will remain after the Spirit has been fully poured out on all flesh. This minority school, promoted by B. B. Warfield and supported by exegetical work of H.A.W. Meyer, has started to gain more ground, even altering the thinking of some postmillennialists previously in the majority camp, such as Loraine Boettner and R. J. Rushdoony.

The appeal of the minority position, apart from its obvious gambit of taking key scriptures literally (; ; ; ; ; etc.), was voiced by Boettner himself after his shift in position: the majority-form of postmillennialism lacks a capstone, which Warfield&#x27;s version does not fail to provide. Warfield also linked his views to an unusual understanding of , premised on Meyer&#x27;s exegesis of the same passage, which presupposed a global conquest of the gospel in order for the supposed prophecy in that verse to be realized, which inexorably leads to a literal fulfillment of the third petition of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer: &quot;Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.&quot;

John Calvin&#x27;s exposition of that part of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer all but adopts the minority postmillennial position but Calvin, and later Charles Spurgeon, were remarkably inconsistent on eschatological matters. Spurgeon delivered a sermon on Psalm 72 explicitly defending the form of absolute postmillennialism held by the minority camp today, but on other occasions he defended premillennialism. Moreover, given the nature of Warfield&#x27;s views, Warfield disdained the millennial labels, preferring the term &quot;eschatological universalism&quot; for the brand of postmillennialism now associated with his thinking.

Warfield, like those who follow in his footsteps, did not seek to support his doctrine of cosmic eschatology from , treating that passage (following Kliefoth, Duesterdieck, and Milligan) as descriptive of the intermediate state and the contrast between church militant and triumphant. This tactic represented an abandonment of the Augustinian approach to the passage, ostensibly justified by a perceived advance in taking the Book of Revelation&#x27;s parallel passages to the little season of Satan more seriously (cf. and ).

===Difference in means===
Postmillennialists also diverge on the means of the gospel&#x27;s conquest. Revivalist postmillennialism is a form of the doctrine held by the Puritans and some today that teaches that the millennium will come about not from Christians changing society from the top down (that is, through its political and legal institutions) but from the bottom up at the grass roots level (that is, through changing people&#x27;s hearts and minds).

Reconstructionist postmillennialism, on the other hand, sees that along with grass roots preaching of the Gospel and explicitly Christian education, Christians should also set about changing society&#x27;s legal and political institutions in accordance with biblical, and also sometimes theonomic, ethics (see dominion theology). The revivalists deny that the same legal and political rules which applied to theocratic state of Ancient Israel should apply directly to modern societies which are no longer directly ruled by Israel&#x27;s prophets, priests, and kings. In the United States, the most prominent and organized forms of postmillennialism are based on Christian reconstructionism and hold to a reconstructionist form of postmillennialism advanced by R.J. Rushdoony, Gary North, Kenneth Gentry, and Greg Bahnsen.

<doc id="349832" wikidata="Q1493080" url="?curid=349832" title="Premillennialism">
<text>Premillennialism, in Christian eschatology, is the belief that Jesus will physically return to the Earth (the Second Coming) before the Millennium, heralding a literal thousand-year messianic age of peace. Premillennialism is based upon a literal interpretation of Revelation 20 () in the New Testament, which describes Jesus&#x27;s reign in a period of a thousand years.

Premillennialism is in contrast to amillennialism and postmillennialism beliefs. Amillennialism interprets as pertaining to the present time, and holds that Christ currently reigns in Heaven with the departed saints. This interpretation views the symbolism of Revelation as referring to a spiritual conflict between Heaven and Hell rather than a physical conflict on Earth. Amillennialists do not view the thousand years mentioned in Revelation as a literal thousand years, but see the number &quot;thousand&quot; as symbolic and numerological and see the kingdom of Christ as already present in the church beginning with the Pentecost in the book of Acts. Denominations such as Oriental Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism and Lutheranism are generally amillennial. Postmillennialism views the millennial rule as a Golden Age in which Christian ethics prosper through preaching and redemptive work, but occurring before the second coming.

Premillennialism is often used to refer specifically to those who adhere to the beliefs in an earthly millennial reign of Christ as well as a rapture of the faithful coming before (dispensational) or after (historic) the Great Tribulation preceding the Millennium. In the 20th century, the belief became common in Evangelicalism according to surveys on this topic.

==Terminology==
The current religious term &quot;premillennialism&quot; did not come into use until the mid-19th century. The word&#x27;s coinage was &quot;almost entirely the work of British and American Protestants and was prompted by their belief that the French and American Revolutions (the French, especially) realized prophecies made in the books of Daniel and Revelation.&quot;

===Other views===
The proponents of amillennialism interpret the millennium as being a symbolic period of time, which is consistent with the highly symbolic nature of the literary and apocalyptic genre of the Book of Revelation, sometimes indicating that the thousand years represent God&#x27;s rule over his creation or the Church.

Postmillennialists hold to the view that the Second Coming will happen after the millennium.

==History==

===Justin Martyr and Irenaeus===

Justin Martyr in the 2nd century was one of the first Christian writers to clearly describe himself as continuing in the &quot;Jewish&quot; belief of a temporary messianic kingdom prior to the eternal state, although the notion of Millennium in his &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot; seem to differ from that of the Apology. According to Johannes Quasten, &quot;In his eschatological ideas Justin shares the views of the Chiliasts concerning the millennium.&quot; He maintains a premillennial distinction, namely that there would be two resurrections, one of believers before Jesus&#x27;s reign and then a general resurrection afterwards. Justin wrote in chapter 80 of his work &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;, &quot;I and others who are right-minded Christians on all points are assured that there will be a resurrection of the dead, and a thousand years in Jerusalem, which will then be built... For Isaiah spoke in that manner concerning this period of a thousand years.&quot; Though he conceded earlier in the same chapter that his view was not universal by saying that he &quot;and many who belong to the pure and pious faith, and are true Christians, think otherwise.&quot;
Irenaeus, the late 2nd century bishop of Lyon, was an outspoken premillennialist. He is best known for his voluminous tome written against the 2nd century Gnostic threat, commonly called &quot;Against Heresies&quot;. In the fifth book of &quot;Against Heresies&quot;, Irenaeus concentrates primarily on eschatology. In one passage he defends premillennialism by arguing that a future earthly kingdom is necessary because of God&#x27;s promise to Abraham, he wrote &quot;The promise remains steadfast... God promised him the inheritance of the land. Yet, Abraham did not receive it during all the time of his journey there. Accordingly, it must be that Abraham, together with his seed (that is, those who fear God and believe in Him), will receive it at the resurrection of the just.&quot; In another place Irenaeus also explained that the blessing to Jacob &quot;belongs unquestionably to the times of the kingdom when the righteous will bear rule, after their rising from the dead. It is also the time when the creation will bear fruit with an abundance of all kinds of food, having been renovated and set free... And all of the animals will feed on the vegetation of the earth... and they will be in perfect submission to man. And these things are borne witness to in the fourth book of the writings of Papias, the hearer of John, and a companion of Polycarp.&quot; (5.33.3) Apparently Irenaeus also held to the sexta-/septamillennial scheme writing that the end of human history will occur after the 6,000th year. (5.28.3).

===Other ante-Nicene premillennialists===

Irenaeus and Justin represent two of the most outspoken premillennialists of the pre-Nicean church. Other early premillennialists included Pseudo-Barnabas, Papias, Methodius, Lactantius, Commodianus Theophilus, Tertullian, Melito, Hippolytus of Rome, Victorinus of Pettau and various Gnostics groups and the Montanists. Many of these theologians and others in the early church expressed their belief in premillennialism through their acceptance of the sexta-septamillennial tradition. This belief claims that human history will continue for 6,000 years and then will enjoy Sabbath for 1,000 years (the millennial kingdom), thus all of human history will have a total of 7,000 years prior to the new creation.

===Ante-Nicene opposition===

The first clear opponent of premillennialism associated with Christianity was the gnostic Marcion. Marcion opposed the use of the Old Testament and most books of the New Testament that were not written by the apostle Paul. Regarding Marcion and premillennialism, Harvard scholar H. Brown noted,
:The first great heretic broke drastically with the faith of the early church in abandoning the doctrine of the imminent, personal return of Christ...Marcion did not believe in a real incarnation, and consequently there was no logical place in his system for a real Second Coming...Marcion expected the majority of mankind to be lost...he denied the validity of the Old Testament and its Law...As the first great heretic, Marcion developed and perfected his heterodox system before orthodoxy had fully defined itself...Marcion represents a movement that so radically transformed the Christian doctrine of God and Christ that it can hardly be said to be Christian.

Throughout the Patristic period—particularly in the 3rd century—there had been rising opposition to premillennialism. Origen was the first to challenge the doctrine openly. Through allegorical interpretation, he had been a proponent of amillennialism (of course, the sexta-septamillennial tradition was itself based upon similar means of allegorical interpretation). Although Origen was not always wholly &quot;orthodox&quot; in his theology, he had at one point completely spiritualized Christ&#x27;s second coming prophesied in the New Testament. Origen did this in his &quot;Commentary on Matthew&quot; when he taught that &quot;Christ&#x27;s return signifies His disclosure of Himself and His deity to all humanity in such a way that all might partake of His glory to the degree that each individual&#x27;s actions warrant (&quot;Commentary on Matthew&quot; 12.30).&quot; Even Origen&#x27;s milder forms of this teaching left no room for a literal millennium and it was so extreme that few actually followed it. But his influence did gain wider acceptance especially in the period following Constantine.

Dionysius of Alexandria stood against premillennialism when the chiliastic work, &quot;The Refutation of the Allegorizers&quot; written by Nepos, a bishop in Egypt became popular in Alexandria. Dionysius argued against Nepos&#x27;s influence and convinced the churches of the region of amillennialism. The church historian, Eusebius, reports this in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;. Eusebius also had low regard for the chiliast, Papias, and he let it be known that in his opinion Papias was &quot;a man of small mental capacity&quot; because he had taken the Apocalypse literally.

===Middle Ages and the Reformation===

====Augustinian eschatological foundation====
Oxford theologian Alister McGrath has noted that &quot;all medieval theology is &#x27;Augustinian&#x27; to a greater or lesser extent.&quot; Augustine&#x27;s (354-430) influence shaped not only the Western Middle Ages, but it also influenced the Protestant reformers, who constantly referred to his teaching in their own debates. His teaching is &quot;still one of the most potent elements in Western religious thought.&quot; Therefore, to analyze what happened to premillennialism in the Middle Ages and the Reformation, it is necessary to observe the Augustinian foundation.

In his early period, Augustine held to the sexta-/septamillennial view common in early Christianity (see above section on Patristic Age). In accordance with this view, Augustine divided history into two separate dispensations, first the church age (the current age of 6,000 years), and then the millennial kingdom (&quot;Sermon 259.2&quot;). Nevertheless, early in his career Augustine converted from premillennialism to amillennialism. Anderson locates three reasons that may account for Augustine&#x27;s theological shift:

# A reaction to Donatist excess - Augustine displayed a revulsion to the Donatists&#x27; bacchanal feasts which seemingly used excessive amounts of food and drink (&quot;City of God&quot;, 20.7). The Donatists were premillennial and thus Augustine formed a connection between their sensual behavior and their earthly eschatological expectation.
# A reaction to eschatological sensationalism - The millennial fervor of premillennialists as the year AD 500 was nearing caused them to have overly jovial celebrations (some septa-/sextamillennial interpreters calculated Jesus&#x27;s birth to have happened 5,500 years after creation). These feasts appeared to Augustine to take more pleasure in the physical world than the spiritual. Such earthly revelry was repulsive to Augustine since he placed little value on the material world.
# A preference for allegorical interpretation - Finally, Augustine was influenced by the popular allegorical interpretation of Scripture, particularly of The Book of Revelation. Tyconius (d. &quot;c&quot;. 400), a Donatist lay theologian, &quot;whose reinterpretation of his culture&#x27;s separatist and millenarian traditions provided the point of departure for what is more brilliant and idiosyncratic in Augustine&#x27;s own theology. And it is Tyconius, most precisely, whose own reading of John&#x27;s Apocalypse determined the Western church&#x27;s exegesis for the next eight hundred years.&quot;

After moving away from premillennialism to amillennialism, Augustine viewed Sabbath rest in the sexta-/septamillennial scheme as &quot;symbolically representative of Eternity.&quot; Moreover, the millennium of Revelation 20 became for him &quot;symbolically representative of Christ’s present reign with the saints.&quot; Richard Landes observed the 4th century as a time of major shift for Christian eschatology by noting that it &quot;marked a crucial moment in the history of millenarianism, since during this period Augustine repudiated even the allegorizing variety he himself had previously accepted. From this point on he dedicated much of his energy to ridding the church of this belief.&quot;

====Medieval and Reformation amillennialism====
Augustine&#x27;s later amillennial view laid the eschatological foundation for the Middle Ages, which practically abandoned premillennialism. The theological term &quot;kingdom&quot; maintained its eschatological function, though it was not necessarily futuristic. Instead it consistently referred to the present age so that the church was currently experiencing the eschaton. Julian of Toledo (642–690) summarizes the medieval doctrine of the millennium by referring to it as &quot;the church of God which, by the diffusion of its faith and works, is spread out as a kingdom of faith from the time of the incarnation until the time of the coming judgment&quot;.

A notable exception to normative medieval eschatology is found in Joachim of Fiore (c. 1135–1202), a Cistercian monk, who to an extent, stressed premillennial themes. Joachim divided earth&#x27;s history into three periods. He assigned each age to a particular person of the Trinity as the guiding principle of that era. The first era was the Old Testament history and was accordingly the age of the Father; the current age of the church was the age of the Son; and still in Joachim&#x27;s future was the age of the Spirit. For Joachim, 1260 was to mark the end of the second and the beginning of the third and final golden age of earth&#x27;s history.

During the Reformation period, amillennialism continued to be the popular view of the Reformers. The Lutherans formally rejected chiliasm (millennialism) in The Augsburg Confession. &quot;Art. XVII., condemns the Anabaptists and others &#x27;who now scatter Jewish opinions that, before the resurrection of the dead, the godly shall occupy the kingdom of the world, the wicked being everywhere suppressed.&#x27;&quot; Likewise, the Swiss Reformer Heinrich Bullinger wrote up the Second Helvetic Confession, which reads &quot;We also reject the Jewish dream of a millennium, or golden age on earth, before the last judgment.&quot; Furthermore, John Calvin wrote in &quot;Institutes&quot; that millennialism is a &quot;fiction&quot; that is &quot;too childish either to need or to be worth a refutation&quot;. The Anglican Church originally formalized a statement against millenarianism in the Anglican Articles. This is observed in the 41st of the Anglican Articles, drawn up by Thomas Cranmer (1553), describing the millennium as a &#x27;fable of Jewish dotage&#x27;, but it was omitted at a later time in the revision under Elizabeth (1563).

Contrarily, certain Anabaptists, Huguenots, and Bohemian Brethren were premillennial. Michael Servetus taught a chiliastic view, though he was denounced by the Reformers as a heretic and executed in Geneva under Calvin&#x27;s authority. A few in the mainstream accepted it, such as Joseph Mede (1586–1638) and possibly Hugh Latimer (died 1555), but it was never a conventional belief throughout the period.

===Modern era===
====17th and 18th centuries====
Premillennialism experienced a revival among 17th century Puritans like Thomas Brightman, Joseph Mede, and others. Although they were not premillennial, the English theologian Daniel Whitby (1688–1726), the German Johann Albrecht Bengel (1687–1752), and the American Jonathan Edwards (1703–58) &quot;fueled millennial ideas with new influence in the nineteenth century.&quot; It was authors such as these who concluded that the decline of the Roman Catholic Church would make way for the conversion and restoration of the nation of Israel. Edwards taught that a type of Millennium would occur &quot;1260 years after A.D. 606 when Rome was recognized as having universal authority.&quot; His Puritan contemporaries, Increase Mather and Cotton Mather, openly proclaimed a belief in a literal millennium. Increase Mather wrote &quot;That which presseth me so, as that I cannot gainsay the Chiliastical opinion, is that I take these things for Principles, and no way doubt but that they are demonstrable. 1. That the thousand apocalyptical years are not passed but future. 2. That the coming of Christ to raise the dead and to judge the earth will be within much less than this thousand years. 3. That the conversion of the Jews will not be till this present state of the world is near unto its end. 4. That, after the Jews&#x27; conversion there will be a glorious day for the elect upon earth, and that this day shall be a very long continuance.&quot;

====19th century to present====
Between 1790 and the mid-19th century, premillennialism was a popular view among English Evangelicals, even within the Anglican church. Thomas Macaulay observed this and wrote &quot;Many Christians believe that the Messiah will shortly establish a kingdom on the earth, and visibly reign over all its inhabitants.&quot;
Throughout the 19th century, premillennialism continued to gain wider acceptance in both the US and in Britain, particularly among the Irvingites, Plymouth Brethren, Christadelphians, Church of God, Christian Israelite Church. Premillennialism continues to be popular among Evangelical, Fundamentalist Christian, and Living Church of God communities in the 20th and 21st centuries, expanding further into the churches of Asia, Africa and South America.

Many traditional denominations continue to oppose the concept of a literal millennial kingdom. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod explicitly states, &quot;When Christ returns, &#x27;new heavens and a new earth&#x27; will be created (2 Pet. 3:10-13).&quot; The catechism of the Catholic Church teaches in paragraph 676 that the millennium is to be understood as &quot;beyond history&quot;:

Whalen has noted that modern premillennialism is &quot;criticized roundly for naïve scholarship which confuses the poetic and inspirational prose of prophecy with fortune telling&quot;, though &quot;Premillennialists retort that they merely follow the Word of God, regardless of ridicule.&quot; He then notes that, nevertheless, &quot;the virtual theology which surrounds premillennialism is today stronger and more widely spread than at any time in history.&quot;

==Historic vs. dispensational schools==
Contemporary premillennialism is divided into two schools of thought.

===Historic school===

Historic, or classic, premillennialism is distinctively non-dispensational. This means that it sees no radical theological distinction between Israel and the Church. It is often posttribulational, meaning that the rapture of the church will occur after a period of tribulation. Historic premillennialism maintains chiliasm because of its view that the church will be caught up to meet Christ in the air and then escort him to the earth in order to share in his literal thousand year rule. Proponents of the view include John Gill, Mike Placko, Charles Spurgeon, James Montgomery Boice, George Eldon Ladd, John Piper, Albert Mohler, Francis Schaeffer, Carl F. H. Henry, Harold Lindsell, D. A. Carson, Bryan Chapell, and Gordon Clark.

===Dispensational school===

Dispensational premillennialism generally holds that Israel and the Church are distinct entities. It also widely holds to the pretribulational return of Christ, which believes that Jesus will return to take up Christians into heaven by means of a rapture immediately before a seven-year worldwide tribulation. This will be followed by an additional return of Christ with his saints (though there are posttribulation dispensationalists, such as Robert Gundry).

Dispensationalism traces its roots to the 1830s and John Nelson Darby (1800–1882), an Anglican churchman and an early leader of the Plymouth Brethren. In the US, the dispensational form of premillennialism was propagated on the popular level largely through the Scofield Reference Bible and on the academic level with Lewis Sperry Chafer&#x27;s eight-volume &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;. More recently dispensational eschatology has been popularized through Hal Lindsey&#x27;s 1970s bestseller, &quot;The Late, Great Planet Earth&quot; and through the &quot;Left Behind&quot; Series by Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins. Popular proponents of dispensational premillennialism have been John F. MacArthur, Phil Johnson, Ray Comfort, Jerry Falwell, Todd Friel, Dwight Pentecost, John Walvoord, Tim Lahaye, Charles Caldwell Ryrie, Norman Geisler, Erwin Lutzer, and Charles L. Feinberg. Craig Blaising and Darrell Bock have developed a form of dispensationalism that is growing in popularity known as progressive dispensationalism. This view understands that an aspect of the eschatological kingdom presently exists, but must wait for the millennium to be realized fully.

<text>Sylvanshine is an optical phenomenon in which dew-covered foliage with wax-coated leaves retroreflect beams of light, as from a vehicle&#x27;s headlights. This effect sometimes makes trees appear snow-covered at night during summer. The phenomenon was named and explained in 1994 by Alistair Fraser of Pennsylvania State University, an expert in meteorological optics. According to his explanation, the epicuticular wax on the leaves causes water to form beads, which in effect, become lenses. These lenses focus the light to a spot on the leaf surface, and the image of this spot is directed as rays in the opposite direction.

<text>Kington is a market town and civil parish in Herefordshire, England. The parish had a population of 3,240.

==Geography==
Kington is from the border with Wales, and lies on the western side of Offa&#x27;s Dyke. The town is in the shadow of Hergest Ridge, and on the River Arrow, where it is crossed by the A44 road. It is northwest of Hereford, the county town. Nearby towns include Presteigne, Builth Wells, Knighton and Leominster. The centre of the town is situated at above sea level. The civil parish covers an area of .

==History==
The name &quot;Kington&quot; is derived from &#x27;King&#x27;s-ton&#x27;, being Anglo-Saxon for &quot;King&#x27;s Town&quot;, similar to other nearby towns such as &quot;Presteigne&quot; meaning &quot;Priest&#x27;s Town&quot; and Knighton being &quot;Knight&#x27;s Town&quot;.

The land on which Kington is sited was held by Anglo-Saxons in 1066, but devastated. After the Norman Conquest Kington then passed to the Crown on the downfall in 1075 of Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford. Before 1121, King Henry I gave Kington to Adam de Port, who founded a new Marcher barony in this part of the early Welsh Marches. Kington seems to have been a quiet barony and was associated with the office of sheriff of Hereford. In 1172, Adam de Port, probably the great-grandson of Henry Port, rebelled and fled the country. He returned in 1174 with a Scottish army, only to flee from the resulting Battle of Alnwick to the great mirth of the Norman court. With this his barony of Kington was taken by the Crown and became an appurtenance of the office of Sheriff of Hereford, finally being granted to William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber in 1203 for £100. The castle then saw action in the Braose Wars against King John, and is likely to have been destroyed by royal forces in August 1216. Within a few years a new fortress was commenced and the nearby Huntington Castle and Kington Castle were abandoned. All that remains of Kington Castle today is a great outcrop of rock topped by a few fragmentary earthworks. The old town clustered around the castle and Norman church on top of a defensive hill above the River Arrow.

‘Chingtune&#x27; was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086, the name meaning &#x27;king&#x27;s town or manor&#x27;, high on the hill above the town where St. Mary&#x27;s Church now stands. The new Kington, called Kyneton in the Fields, was laid out between 1175 and 1230 on land bordering the River Arrow and possibly designated as part of the Saxon open-field system.

Situated on the direct route the drovers took from Hergest Ridge and with eight annual fairs, Kington grew in importance as a market town, and there is still a thriving livestock market on Thursdays. The town retains the medieval grid pattern of streets and back lanes.

In the chapel of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, there is the alabaster tomb of Sir Thomas Vaughan of nearby Hergest Court, slain at the Battle of Banbury in 1469, and his wife, Elen Gethin. The ghost of Sir Thomas, and also that of the Black Dog of Hergest, are said to haunt the area around Hergest Ridge. The Black Dog&#x27;s sighting reputedly presages death.

==Governance==

An electoral ward in the name of Kington Town exists. This ward had a population taken at the Kington Parish of 3,240. The former Kington Town Hall was completed in 1820.

==Population==
Census data is as follows:
==Climate==
As with the rest of the UK, Kington benefits from a maritime climate, with limited seasonal temperature ranges, and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year. The nearest met office weather station is Lyonshall, around to the east of the town.

The absolute maximum temperature recorded is during August 1990. 
In an average year however, the warmest day should record , 
with a total of 7.7 days reporting a value of or above.

The absolute minimum temperature is , 
reported in December 1981. Typically 44 nights should record an air frost.

Rainfall averages around a year, with over falling on 136 days. All averages refer to the period 1971 to 2000.

==Economy==

In the 13th century the new medieval town was formed at the foot of the hill and became primarily a wool-trading market town on an important drovers&#x27; road. Its location and historic character is the reason why so many waymarked long-distance footpaths pass through Kington today, including the Mortimer Trail, the Herefordshire Trail and the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path. The Black and White Village Trail follows the half-timbered cottages and houses in local Herefordshire villages.

In the 1870s, an assessment was thus: &quot;The trade of the town is chiefly with the agriculturists of the adjoining county of Radnor. There are two banking establishments, viz., the head offices of the Kington and Radnorshire bank (Messrs. Davies, Banks, &amp; Davies), established in 1808, and a branch of the Midland Banking Company, Limited. There is an extensive iron foundry, nail, and agricultural implement manufactory carried on by Messrs. James. Meredith &amp; Co., and the building and tanning trades are well represented. There are also some extensive corn mills and malt-houses. About four miles west of the town are the Old Radnor lime rocks, which are celebrated for their superior quality for building and for agricultural purposes. The market day is Tuesday, considerable business being transacted on that day in eggs, butter, poultry, &amp;c., and is the mart to which the Welsh send their produce, to meet dealers who frequent this town from all quarters.&quot;

During the Second World War, the large Kington Camp was constructed close to the town by the War Office. It was first used by the British as a re-grouping point after Dunkirk, housing returned soldiers in often poor conditions. In 1943-4, Wimpeys built two US General Hospitals to cater for predicted wounded from the European campaigns. Each employed 500 US military and administrative personnel and 50 local people. There were administrative buildings, labs, operating theatres and dental clinics as well as personnel quarters, chapels, rehabilitation wards, cinemas, mess halls, warehouses, and laboratories. Between 1944–1945 there were 13,000 patients. After the war buildings were used by the Polish Resettlement Corps (many of the Poles who had fought alongside Western allies did not wish to return to a newly communist dominated Poland). Many of the buildings at the Camp remain standing, although two-thirds have disappeared since the Second World War. Some are used by local businesses.

The Kington economy has suffered along with the fortunes of the farming industry in the area. Its rural location and lack of good transport connections means local unemployment has been high for many decades, with low pay rates and many part-time occupations in small businesses including farming and the retail and service sectors. There is a small tourist industry, though concentrated in the summer months, but it maintains the air of an unspoilt town on the borders. There is a traditional livestock market, situated off Duke Street, on a Thursday, where farmers bring their stock to market. There is currently a weekly food and crafts market every Friday and also a W.I market in Bridge Street on Friday morning, home cooked goods are sold.
The High Street has a number of resilient and interesting independent shops.

===Kington Connected (KC3)===

KC3 was begun in 1993, when BT Group, Apple, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Rural Development Commission chose Kington to host a pilot study into the effect that IT and sophisticated telecommunications might have on small communities. Fifteen ISDN lines were installed for digital data transmission and KC3 became a remote office and payroll service for companies including ICI and banks, with remote work. There was also significant support to local businesses and schools. In 2006, KC3 split the commercial side from the community and voluntary side. The community and voluntary side ceased trading in March 2007 and Marches Access Point was formed to continue to provide computer access, resource centre and training opportunities. The commercial side of KC3 became KC3.net and in 2009 there was a further management buyout by V8 media which signalled the end of KC3.net in Kington.

The project was featured in an episode of The Net in June 1994.

==Education==
The town has a primary school and a combined secondary school and sixth form — the Lady Hawkins&#x27; School. Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s cousin Sir John Hawkins married, and in her will, Lady Hawkins left £800 to the town to establish the school. The school is unique in having special permission from the Royal Navy to fly the White Ensign on its foundress day. Notable former students include singer Ellie Goulding and actor Jessica Raine.

==Transport==
The A44 road heads around the town on a bypass; it previously went through the town centre.

Bus services run to Newtown, Powys, Llandrindod Wells, Knighton, Presteigne, Leominster and Hereford. The town has its own bus company, Sargeants Brothers, which was founded in the 1920s, and today provides bus services to Hereford and Mid Wales, though this is no longer run by the brothers, but their sons. Their bus depot is on Mill Street.

The Kington Tramway opened in 1820 and ran until taken over by the railways.

The Leominster and Kington Railway received royal assent in July 1854, and the 13 miles and 25 chain length opened to Kington in August 1857. Leased to the Great Western Railway from 1862, it was later amalgamated with it. When the Kington and Eardisley Railway replaced the tramway in 1875, it built a new through station at Kington, which it jointly owned with the Leominster and Kington Railway. The old station, slightly to the south, became the goods depot.

Traffic rose during World War II, with the US Army hospital camp at Hergest. Decline set in after the war, and it closed to passengers on 5 February 1955. Freight traffic ceased in 1964, after which the track was taken up and the line abandoned.

Today the nearest station is Knighton on the Heart of Wales Line, though Leominster is quicker to drive to and has more frequent services, being on the Welsh Marches Line. Bus services mostly connect with Hereford railway station, as well with Llandrindod railway station.

Shobdon Aerodrome is located close to the town.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter. 

Local radio station are BBC Hereford and Worcester, Sunshine Radio, Capital Mid-Counties, Greatest Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire, and Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Hereford Times. 

==Sport==
Kington Golf Club, at above sea level on Bradnor Hill, is the highest 18-hole golf club in England. The course opened in 1926 and was designed by Cecil Hutchison, who was also involved in the design of Pulborough. The course is of 6,000 yards and has no bunkers.

Kington Town F.C. play in the West Midlands (Regional) League.

Kington has also been the host town for the Marin Rough (cycle) Ride since 2003.

==Tourism==

Kington Museum is open April to September inclusive, and is on Mill Street in the town centre. Near the town is Hergest Croft Gardens, part of the Hergest Estate, which is open to the public March to October. In June, for several weeks, is the annual Kington Festival in the town.

Ye Olde Tavern is a late 18th/early 19th century Grade II listed public house at 22 Victoria Rd. It is on the Campaign for Real Ale&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.

The Burton Hotel is a hotel and health centre, on Mill Street. The town also has a Youth Hostel on Victoria Road, which is open from late March to late October.

<text>Lindenwood University is a private university in St. Charles, Missouri, United States. Founded in 1832 by George Champlin Sibley and Mary Easton Sibley as The Lindenwood School for Girls, it is the second-oldest higher-education institution west of the Mississippi River.

Lindenwood offers undergraduate and graduate degrees through nine colleges and schools. Its enrollment was 6,992 students in 2021. The main academic and residential campus is located northwest of St. Louis, Missouri, in St. Charles.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
Lindenwood University traces its roots back to George Champlin Sibley, an early 19th-century American explorer, soldier, Indian agent, and politician, and his wife Mary Easton Sibley, an educator. In 1808, Acting Governor and friend Frederick Bates promoted Sibley to the position of chief factor at Fort Osage in western Missouri, near present-day Kansas City, Missouri. While at Fort Osage, Sibley immediately set to work creating relationships with the neighboring Osage tribes. He also met Mary Easton, the daughter of Rufus Easton, a prominent St. Louis attorney and Missouri&#x27;s second Attorney General. The couple were married in 1815. During the Sibleys&#x27; time at Fort Osage, Mary began teaching the children at the fort.

In 1813, Sibley opened a temporary trading post at Fort Sibley, now known as the town of Arrow Rock, Missouri, which remained in operation until 1822. After the trading post shut down, George and Mary remained at Fort Osage, with George serving as postmaster until the fort closed in 1825. The couple then settled in St. Charles, where Mary began teaching family members and later, in 1832, other young women from the community. Lindenwood University is now considered the second-oldest higher-education institution west of the Mississippi River, after Saint Louis University, as well as the first women&#x27;s college west of the Mississippi. In 1829, the Sibleys purchased of land, known as the &quot;Linden Wood&quot; because of the numerous linden trees. The Sibleys borrowed money and began clearing the overgrown property to convert it into a farm with livestock brought from Fort Osage. They completed construction of a cabin and outhouses and moved into Linden Wood in December 1829. As the work on Linden Wood continued, the idea of opening a boarding school evolved.

Mary Sibley took in students within a year of moving into the cabin. Her 12-year-old sister, Alby, became the first student at Linden Wood in the fall of 1830. A year later, the first two paying students arrived; in early 1832, the Sibleys made plans to expand the cabin to create a boarding school for women to over a dozen students During the 1830s, the school was known as The Boarding School for Young Ladies at Linden Wood, Missouri. Mary took charge of the boarding school and developed a strict curriculum that included literature, grammar, writing, spelling, and diction. French, music and piano, landscape painting, flower painting and needle work were available for an additional fee. The school was one of the first to require physical education, which included walking and dancing.
By the 1840s, the boarding school had grown to 30 students. As the enrollment expanded, the Sibleys added new rooms to the cabin. The continued improvements created a financial strain on the school and Mary Sibley traveled to the East Coast to solicit additional funding. In the early 1850s, the school was on the brink of closing when the Sibleys offered the property to the Presbyterian Church. In 1853, the school was incorporated by special act of the Missouri Legislature and became known as the Lindenwood College for Women. The newly chartered college was placed under the control of 15 directors appointed by the Presbytery of St. Louis. On July 4, 1856, the cornerstone was laid for a new permanent brick building to replace the original log cabins. The new building, Sibley Hall, was completed in July 1857, and at the time contained the entire school. This event marked the beginning of a new era of significant growth for Lindenwood.

George Sibley died in 1863. Following his death, the college charter was amended in 1870 to provide that the appointment of directors for the management of the college would be under the control of the Synod of Missouri instead of the Presbytery of St. Louis. A south wing was added to Sibley Hall in 1881 and a north wing in 1886. The school began expanding in the early 20th century with four new buildings constructed between 1900 and 1920.

In 1913, the school was accredited as a junior college by the North Central Association. Lindenwood received a $4 million bequest in 1918, the entire estate of the late Margaret Leggat Butler, wife of Colonel James Gay Butler, a Civil War veteran and philanthropist. The college used the funds to establish a permanent endowment and moved from a two-year to a four-year curriculum. A few years later, the college became a full member of the North Central Association.

The college became a co-educational institution in 1969 and changed its name from Lindenwood College for Women to Lindenwood Colleges, with a separate college for men and women. In 1970, the college started offering evening classes and in 1976 began awarding master&#x27;s degrees. That same year, the St. Louis Football Cardinals of the NFL constructed a football field for practices. In 1980, the college became a member of the NAIA for athletics. Lindenwood Colleges, Lindenwood College for Men and Lindenwood College for Women were merged into Lindenwood College in 1983. It was known as Lindenwood College until 1997, at which time the school changed its name to the current name of Lindenwood University.

=== Spellmann Era revitalization ===
By 1989, Lindenwood College was bankrupt with student enrollment below 800. The college was in danger of closing when the administration hired Dennis Spellmann as the new president. Spellmann immediately began to implement changes, eliminating co-ed dorms, placing the emphasis on a &quot;values-centered&quot; approach in the classroom, and eliminating tenure.

The university began an extensive expansion of academic, residential, and athletic facilities starting in the mid-1990s which included construction of eight new residence halls, the Spellmann Campus Center, Lou Brock Sports Complex, and Harlen C. Hunter Stadium, as well as extensions to Ayres Hall and Harmon Hall. A change that caused controversy for the school was the &quot;Pork for Tuition&quot; program begun in 2002 and designed to help rural families pay for tuition by the university accepting livestock in return for discounts. The animals were then processed and used in the school cafeteria. At the time, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals staged a small protest in Saint Charles in response to the program. The Spellmann administration&#x27;s focus on enrollment growth made Lindenwood the fastest-growing university in the Midwest during the time from the mid-1990s into the early 2000s. In 2006, Dennis Spellmann died by which time the university had seen its endowment grow to more than $50 million. James Evans became Lindenwood&#x27;s 21st president on February 9, 2007.

=== Recent history ===

Expansion continued under Evans. The J. Scheidegger Center for the Arts, a performance and fine arts center, opened in late 2008 at a cost of $32 million. The university also constructed new dormitories and began building a new home for university presidents. Construction of Evans Commons began in 2009 and was completed during the summer of 2011. In 2011, Lindenwood University became the Lindenwood University System. Lindenwood University-Belleville transitioned from a satellite campus to a separately accredited college. The university was notified of the accrediting decision in November by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Under the new accreditation, Lindenwood University-Belleville will keep the same name and the same governing board as the St. Charles campus, now considered to be a sister school as part of the Lindenwood University System. By 2010, Lindenwood University&#x27;s endowment had reached $148 million Early the following year, Lindenwood began construction of a new parking lot to ease congestion on campus. The university announced a new athletic facility would be constructed behind the west end zone stands of Hunter Stadium. The three-story, building includes new football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, and field hockey locker rooms. It also houses a new academic support center for student-athletes, coaches&#x27; offices, and meeting rooms overlooking the stadium. Lindenwood plans to construct a new administrative building, as well as additional dorms and campus facilities, and expand enrollment to over 20,000 students. The university and the DESCO Group announced in February 2011 that the St. Charles City Council had approved a resolution supporting the Lindenwood Town Center, a planned $30 million development that includes a shopping center, retail/business plaza, hotel, and apartment-style student housing complexes.

In the fall of 2012, the university announced it had purchased the property that was previously home to the Barat Academy. The facility opened in 2007 and was used by the private high school until it was evicted in 2011 and relocated to a smaller property. Lindenwood purchased the facility for $8.1 million with plans to enlarge classrooms and add chemistry labs. The building became the home of the Lindenwood Nursing and Allied Health Sciences program opening in fall 2013. It is a BSN completion program for students who hold associate degrees in nursing. The university hired Peggy Ellis as the dean of the program. Ellis had served since 2005 as the associate dean of graduate studies at the St. Louis University nursing school.

In May 2014, the Lindenwood University Board of Directors approved plans for a 100,000-square-foot Library and Academic Resources Center off First Capitol Drive, adjacent to the Welcome Center on the St. Charles campus. In 2015, Lindenwood announced the construction of the new facility, which will replace the 36,000-square-foot Margaret Leggat Butler Library, built in 1929. The new Academic Resources Center building will bring together a variety of student services under one roof, including the Writing Center, Student and Academic Support Services (SASS), Career Services, English as a Second Language, the Office of International Students and Scholars, and Lindenwood Online, all of which were involved in putting together the proposal for the new structure. The building will also include classroom space and an expanded coffee shop. Completion is expected in the latter part of 2016. The university formerly owned the Daniel Boone historic site in Defiance, Missouri southwest of the St. Charles campus. The historic site was donated to the people of St. Charles County in April 2016.

In 2023, the university acquired Dorsey College, a for-profit trade school with seven campuses in Michigan. The school also made large cutbacks removing nine staff positions and ten sports programs including men&#x27;s tennis, lacrosse, and wrestling.

==Campus==

The main campus is located in historic St. Charles, Missouri, on high ground overlooking downtown St. Charles and the Missouri River. Its buildings range from historic 19th-century buildings to modern on-going construction projects. The campus stretches roughly one mile from southwest to northeast and is divided by a meandering stream. To the west, the campus is bordered by Duchesne Drive with Droste Road and West Clay Street forming the southern boundary. First Capitol Drive runs along the eastern edge of the campus and Gamble St. adjoins its north side. The eastern area of campus is the oldest section with the most recent expansion in the central and southern areas. The northwestern area has almost no structures. The university is a dry campus with alcoholic beverages prohibited on campus and in all university buildings.

The eastern part of the LU campus is the oldest part and contains many historic buildings characterized by their early 20th-century architecture and vast numbers of linden trees. This area is located near the site of the original log cabin where Mary Sibley began the Linden Wood School for Girls. The eastern part of campus is the location of many of the academic buildings and contains the Margaret Leggat Butler Library, the university&#x27;s main academic library. Roemer Hall, constructed in 1921, is the main administration building on the campus and home to the president&#x27;s office, financial aid office, the registrar, and the business office, as well as the School of Education.

Sibley Hall was built in 1856 and is the oldest building at Lindenwood. It was the original building for the Linden Wood School for Girls, and is still used as a women&#x27;s dormitory today; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Numerous mysterious incidents have occurred over the years, and legends say that Sibley Hall is haunted by the ghost of Mary Sibley.
The central portion of the Lindenwood campus includes various residence halls and athletic facilities. At the heart of the campus sits the Spellmann Campus Center. It was built in 2002 and is located in the center of campus on the hillside near the highest part of the campus. Spellmann Center overlooks Harlen C. Hunter Stadium and much of the rest of the campus. The modern student center houses a cafeteria, a coffee shop, the Student Health Center, Student Activities Office, student media publications and student-run radio station, as well as office, classroom, and meeting spaces.

To the west of the Spellmann Center is the 7,450-seat Harlen C. Hunter Stadium, the main athletic stadium on campus. Built in 1976 by the St. Louis Cardinals NFL football team as a training camp location, the stadium opened in 1979 and was renovated in 1988, 2004, and 2009. The stadium is the home of Lindenwood Lions football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s field hockey, and both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse programs.

To the northwest of the stadium is the 3,270-seat Robert F. Hyland Performance Arena. This was built in 1997 and is home to both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, volleyball, wrestling, table tennis, dance, and cheerleading teams. The facility also includes the athletic department offices and classroom space. Evans Commons is being constructed adjacent to the Hyland Arena. Construction for the $20 million student center began in May 2009. The facility opened in August 2011 and features a second dining hall, three basketball courts, and a roller hockey rink, a suspended jogging track, a fitness center, offices for student activities, quiet study areas, and a US post office.
The southern and western areas of campus contain much of the new construction. The J. Scheidegger Center for the Arts opened in 2008 at a cost of $32 million and lies on the southeast edge of campus. The state-of-the-art, building includes space for performance and arts education. It houses classrooms and faculty offices, as well as the 1,200-seat Bezemes Family Theatre, the Emerson Black Box Theatre, the 1,200-seat Boyle Family Gallery, the Charter LUTV HD Studio, and studio space for performing arts and communications students. The Scheidegger Center is also the home of the School of Fine and Performing Arts.

To the northwest of the Scheidegger Center is the Lou Brock Sports Complex. The Sports Complex is home to the Lindenwood Lions baseball and softball teams. The new president&#x27;s house, known as Lindenwood House, opened in 2010, and is located on a hill overlooking the Sports Complex and much of the campus. The western portions of campus contain many of the new residence halls. Reynolds Hall and Pfremmer Hall were constructed in 2008 and sit between the new president&#x27;s residence and LU Commons, the new student and recreation center.

===Residence halls===
More than 3,800 students live on campus the university&#x27;s 19 residence halls segregated into male and female facilities. Each residence hall has a live-in resident director and three assistant resident directors. Male residence halls include Ayres Hall, Cobbs Hall, Flowers Hall, Guffey Hall, Linden Lodge, Mathews Hall, and Parker Hall. Female residence halls include Blanton Hall, Calvert Rogers, Eastlick Hall, Irwin Hall, McCluer Hall, New Ayres Hall, Niccolls Hall, Rauch Memorial Hall, Sibley Hall, Pfremmer Hall, Reynolds Hall, and Stumberg Hall.

Lindenwood purchased land adjacent to the main campus containing various residential properties to create two large student quarters in adjacent neighborhoods, known as the Linden Terraces and First Capitol Houses. The properties offer on-campus housing for married student couples and single-parent students, and are also available to male and female students. Linden Terrace neighborhood lies just southwest from the main campus. First Capitol Houses and the Powell Terrace Residential Area sit east of campus across First Capitol Drive from the main campus.

===Regional centers===
The period of growth at Lindenwood started by Spellmann included the opening of regional centers for adult evening education programs in various locations around Greater St. Louis. In 2009, the university opened a St. Louis City Location, at 1409 Washington Avenue a rapidly growing loft district in the city. Lindenwood also operates regional centers in Daniel Boone Campus, Florissant, Moscow Mills, O&#x27;Fallon, South County, Downtown St. Louis, Westport, Weldon Spring, Wildwood, and the former Southern Air Restaurant in Wentzville.

===Lindenwood University – Belleville===

In 2008, Lindenwood University announced plans to expand facilities at Lindenwood University – Belleville and increased academic programs from an adult continuing education structure to offer traditional daytime semester-based programs. Starting in the fall of 2009, LU–Belleville began offering courses in business administration, communications, criminal justice, and health management. The Lindenwood University at Belleville sports teams were known the &quot;Lynx&quot; and competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and its American Midwest Conference (AMC) until 2020. Previously, programs were only offered for junior- and senior-level students during the first semester of traditional daytime classes. These programs have now been extended to underclassman. Lindenwood expected to enroll 2,000 daytime students at the Belleville campus within the next 5 to 10 years of expanding it to a residential campus. In November 2011, Lindenwood University–Belleville completed the transition from satellite campus of Lindenwood University to a full-fledged, stand-alone college. Lindenwood University–Belleville was considered to be sister school of Lindenwood University in St. Charles, and while the two schools share a name and governing board, the Belleville campus was no longer under direct operation of the St. Charles campus.

On August 1, 2015, Brett Barger began serving as interim president of the Belleville campus. The interim title was removed and Barger was appointed president of the Lindenwood University Belleville campus in October 2015. Barger is a longtime member of the Lindenwood family, having first arrived at the St. Charles campus as a student in 1990. He was hired in 1994 and has three Lindenwood degrees – EdD, MBA, and BA. He previously served as the associate vice president for operations and finance. Barger replaced Jerry Bladdick, who left Lindenwood for a new position in Florida.

In 2019, citing &quot;ongoing financial and enrollment challenges&quot;, the Lindenwood University Board of Trustees announced that LU–Belleville will cease to offer traditional semester-based undergraduate programs after the 2019–20 academic year. Students enrolled at the Belleville campus will be allowed to transfer to the St. Charles campus, who promised to honor all financial aid guarantees. The decision will revert the Belleville location back to an extension site for evening programs.

<doc id="349842" wikidata="Q408646" url="?curid=349842" title="Triclosan">
<text>Triclosan (sometimes abbreviated as TCS) is an antibacterial and antifungal agent present in some consumer products, including toothpaste, soaps, detergents, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. It is similar in its uses and mechanism of action to triclocarban. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent, the risk of antimicrobial resistance, and its possible role in disrupted hormonal development remains controversial. Additional research seeks to understand its potential effects on organisms and environmental health.

Triclosan was developed in 1966. A 2006 study recommended showering with 2% triclosan as a regimen in surgical units to rid patients&#x27; skin of methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). 
== Uses ==
Triclosan was used as a hospital scrub in the 1970s. Prior to its change in regulatory status in the EU and US, it had expanded commercially and was a common ingredient in soaps (0.10–1.00%), shampoos, deodorants, toothpastes, mouthwashes, cleaning supplies, and pesticides. It also was part of consumer products, including kitchen utensils, toys, bedding, socks, and trash bags.

Triclosan was registered as a pesticide in 1969. U.S. EPA registration numbers are required for all EPA-registered pesticides. As of 2017, there were five registrations for triclosan with the EPA. Currently, there are 20 antimicrobial registrations with the EPA under the regulations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The antimicrobial active ingredient is added to a variety of products where it acts to slow or stop the growth of bacteria, fungi, and mildew. In commercial, institutional, and industrial equipment uses, triclosan is incorporated in conveyor belts, fire hoses, dye bath vats, or ice-making equipment as an antimicrobial. Triclosan may be directly applied to commercial HVAC coils, where it prevents microbial growth that contributes to product degradation.

In the United States, by 2000, triclosan and triclocarban (TCC) could be found in 75% of liquid soaps and 29% of bar soaps, and triclosan was used in more than 2,000 consumer products.

In healthcare, triclosan is used in surgical scrubs and hand washes. Use in surgical units is effective with a minimum contact time of approximately two minutes. More recently, showering with 2% triclosan has become a recommended regimen in surgical units for the decolonization of patients whose skin carries methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). Two small uncontrolled case studies reported the use of triclosan correlated with reduction in MRSA infections.

Triclosan is also used in the coatings for some surgical sutures. There is good evidence these triclosan-coated sutures reduce the risk of surgical site infection. The World Health Organization, the American College of Surgeons and the Surgical Infection Society point out the benefit of triclosan-coated sutures in reducing the risk for surgical site infection.

Triclosan has been employed as a selective agent in molecular cloning. A bacterial host transformed by a plasmid harboring a triclosan-resistant mutant &quot;FabI&quot; gene (mFabI) as a selectable marker can grow in presence of high dose of triclosan in growth media.

===Effectiveness===
In surgery, triclosan coated sutures reduce the risk of surgical site infection. Some studies suggest that antimicrobial hand soaps containing triclosan provide a slightly greater bacterial reduction on the hands compared to plain soap. , the US FDA had found clear benefit to health for some consumer products containing triclosan, but not in others; for example the FDA had no evidence that triclosan in antibacterial soaps and body washes provides any benefit over washing with regular soap and water.

A Cochrane review of 30 studies concluded that triclosan/copolymer-containing toothpastes produced a 22% reduction in both dental plaque and gingival inflammation when compared with fluoride toothpastes without triclosan/copolymer. There was weak evidence of a reduction in tooth cavities, and no evidence of reduction in periodontitis.

A study of triclosan toothpastes did not find any evidence that it causes an increase in serious adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks.

A study by Colgate-Palmolive found a significant reduction in gingivitis, bleeding, and plaque with the use of triclosan-containing toothpaste. An independent review by the Cochrane group suggests that the reduction in gingivitis, bleeding, and plaque is statistically significant (unlikely to occur by chance) but not clinically significant (unlikely to provide noticeable effects).

Triclosan is used in food storage containers although this use is banned in the European Union since 2010.

Veterinary use as a biocidal product in the EU is governed by the Biocidal Products Directive.

== Chemical structure and properties ==
This organic compound is a white powdered solid with a slight aromatic, phenolic odor. Categorized as a polychloro phenoxy phenol, triclosan is a chlorinated aromatic compound that has functional groups representative of both ethers and phenols. Phenols often demonstrate antibacterial properties. Triclosan is soluble in ethanol, methanol, diethyl ether, and strongly basic solutions such as a 1M sodium hydroxide solution, but only slightly soluble in water. Triclosan can be synthesized from 2,4-dichlorophenol.

===Synthesis===
Under a reflux process, 2,4,4&#x27;-trichloro-2&#x27;-methoxydiphenyl ether is treated with aluminium chloride.

The United States Pharmacopeia formulary has published a monograph for triclosan that sets purity standards.

==Mechanism of action==
At high concentrations, triclosan acts as a biocide with multiple cytoplasmic and membrane targets. However, at the lower concentrations seen in commercial products, triclosan appears bacteriostatic, and it targets bacteria primarily by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis.

Triclosan binds to bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR) enzyme, which is encoded by the gene &quot;fabI&quot;. This binding increases the enzyme&#x27;s affinity for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This results in the formation of a stable, ternary complex of ENR-NAD+-triclosan, which is unable to participate in fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acids are necessary for building and reproducing cell membranes. Vertebrates do not have an ENR enzyme and thus are not affected by this mode of action.

===Endocrine disruptor===
Triclosan has been found to be a weak endocrine disruptor, though the relevance of this to humans is uncertain. The compound has been found to bind with low affinity to both the androgen receptor and the estrogen receptor, where both agonistic and antagonistic responses have been observed.

===Efflux pump inducer===
Triclosan may upregulate or induce efflux pumps in bacteria causing them to become resistant against variety of other antibiotics.

==Exposure==
Humans are exposed to triclosan through skin absorption when washing hands or in the shower, brushing teeth, using mouthwash or doing dishes, and through ingestion when swallowed. When triclosan is released into the environment, additional exposure to the chemical is possible through ingesting plants grown in soil treated with sewage sludge, or eating fish exposed to it.

An article from the American Society of Agronomy refers to a study done by Monica Mendez &quot;et al.&quot;, in which the researchers irrigated plants with water containing triclosan and months later found it in all edible parts of tomato and onion plants. Triclosan is found to kill a wide spectrum of bacteria, and the researchers are also concerned about the effect it has on the beneficial bacteria in soil.

==Distribution, metabolism, and elimination==
Once absorbed, triclosan is metabolized by humans primarily through conjugation reactions into glucuronide and sulfate conjugates that are excreted in feces and urine. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that triclosan sulfate and glucuronide may be formed in the liver at approximately equal rates at the environmentally relevant concentration of 1 to 5 microMolar. When concentrations of triclosan are below 1 microMolar, sulfonation is expected to be the major metabolic pathway for elimination.

==Health concerns==
Because of potential health concerns, due to the possibility of antimicrobial resistance, endocrine disruption and other issues as listed below, triclosan has been designated as a &quot;contaminant of emerging concern (CEC)&quot; by the United States Geological Survey, meaning it is under investigation for public health risk. &quot;Emerging contaminants&quot; can be broadly defined as any synthetic or naturally occurring chemical or any microorganism that is not commonly monitored in the environment but has the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological or human health effects. Triclosan is thought to accumulate in wastewater and return to drinking water, thus propagating a buildup that could cause increasing effects with ongoing use.

In the United States, after a decades-long review of the potential health issues from this contaminant of emerging concern, the FDA ruled on September 6, 2016, that 19 active ingredients including triclosan are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE). (See policy section below).

===Allergic===
Triclosan has been associated with a higher risk of food allergy. This may be because exposure to bacteria reduces allergies, as predicted by the hygiene hypothesis, and not caused by toxicology of triclosan itself. This effect may also occur with chlorhexidine gluconate and PCMX, among other antibacterial agents. Other studies have linked triclosan to allergic contact dermatitis in some individuals. Additionally, triclosan concentrations have been associated with allergic sensitization, especially inhalant and seasonal allergens, rather than food allergens.

===By-product exposure===
Triclosan can react with the free chlorine in chlorinated tap water to produce lesser amounts of other compounds, such as 2,4-dichlorophenol. Some of these intermediates convert into dioxins upon exposure to UV radiation (from the sun or other sources). The dioxins that can form from triclosan are not thought to be congeners of toxicologic concern for mammals, birds and fish.

===Hormonal===
Concerns on the health effects of triclosan have been raised after it was detected in human breast milk, blood, and urine samples. Studies on rats have shown that triclosan exposure modulates estrogen-dependent responses. There have been many studies performed over the years both in vivo and in vitro, in male and female fish and rats and they support the conclusion that triclosan possesses (anti)estrogenic and (anti)androgenic properties depending on species, tissues, and cell types.

Human studies on triclosan and hormone effects are fewer in number than those on animals, but are being conducted. In a 2017 study on 537 pregnant women in China, prenatal triclosan exposure was associated with increased cord testosterone levels in the infants.

==History==
Triclosan (TCS) was patented in 1964 by Swiss company Ciba-Geigy. The earliest known safety testing began in 1968. It was introduced the next year, mainly for use in hospitals, and was in worldwide production and use by the early 1970s.

In 1997 Ciba-Geigy merged with another Swiss company, Sandoz, to form Novartis. During the merger, Ciba-Geigy&#x27;s chemical business was spun off to become Ciba Specialty Chemicals, which was acquired in 2008 by chemical giant BASF. BASF currently manufactures TCS under the brand name Irgasan DP300.

==Environmental concerns==

===Treatment and disposal===
Exposure to triclosan in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, triclosan is sent to municipal sewage treatment plants, where, in the United States, about 97–98% of triclosan is removed. Studies show that substantial quantities of triclosan (170,000–970,000 kg/yr) can escape from wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters. In a study on effluent from wastewater treatment facilities, approximately 75% of triclocarban was present in sewage sludge. This poses a potential environmental and ecological hazard, particularly for aquatic systems. The volume of triclosan, in the United States, re-entering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is 44,000 ± 60,000 kg/yr. Triclosan can attach to other substances suspended in aquatic environments, which potentially endangers marine organisms and may lead to further bioaccumulation. Ozone is considered to be an effective tool for removing triclosan during sewage treatment. As little triclosan is released through plastic and textile household consumer products, these are not considered to be major sources of triclosan contamination.

During wastewater treatment, a portion of triclosan is degraded, while the remainder adsorbs to sewage sludge or exits the plant as effluent. A mass balance in Athens (Greece) Sewage Treatment Plant (2013) showed that 43% of triclosan is accumulated to the primary and secondary sludge, 45% is lost due to degradation while the rest 12% is discharged to the environment via the secondary treated wastewater. In the environment, triclosan may be degraded by microorganisms or react with sunlight, forming other compounds, which include chlorophenols and dioxins.

During 1999 to 2000, US Geological Survey detected TCS in 57.6% of streams and rivers sampled.

===Bioaccumulation===
While studies using semi-permeable membrane devices have found that triclosan does not strongly bioaccumulate, methyl-triclosan is comparatively more stable and lipophilic and thus poses a higher risk of bioaccumulation. The ability of triclosan to bioaccumulate is affected by its ionization state in different environmental conditions.

Global warming may increase uptake and effects of triclosan in aquatic organisms.

===Ecotoxicity===

Triclosan is toxic to aquatic bacteria at levels found in the environment. It is highly toxic to various types of algae and has the potential to affect the structure of algal communities, particularly immediately downstream of effluents from wastewater treatment facilities that treat household wastewaters. Triclosan has been observed in multiple organisms, including algae, aquatic blackworms, fish, and dolphins. It has also been found in land animals including earthworms and species higher up the food chain. In toxicity experiments with &quot;Vibrio fischeri&quot; marine bacterium, an EC50 value of TCS equal to 0.22 mg/L has been determined. Few data are available for the long-term toxicity of TCS to algae, daphnids and fish, while enough data are available for its acute toxicity on these groups of organisms.

A 2017 study that used risk quotient (RQ) methodology and evaluated the ecological threat due to the discharge of wastewater containing TCS in European rivers, reported that the probability that RQ values exceeds 1 ranged from 0.2% (for rivers with dilution factor of 1000) to 45% (for rivers with dilution factor 2).

Triclosan favors anaerobic conditions which is typical in soil and sediment. The antimicrobial properties of Triclosan are resistant to anaerobic degradation which is the main contributor to its persistence in the environment.

==Resistance concerns==

Concern pertains to the potential for cross-resistance (or co-resistance) to other antimicrobials. Numerous studies have been performed and there have been results indicating that the use of biocidal agents, such as triclosan, can cause cross-resistance.
A study done in a wide range of bacteria and different classes of antibiotics showed that &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Stenotrophomonas maltophilia&quot;, already resistant to triclosan, had increased resistance against antibiotics tetracycline and norfloxacin when exposed to triclosan.
Results from a study published in &quot;The American Journal of Infection Control&quot; showed that exposure to triclosan was associated with a high risk of developing resistance and cross-resistance in &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. This was not observed with exposure to chlorhexidine or a hydrogen peroxide-based agent (during the conditions in said study).

==Alternatives==
A comprehensive meta-analysis published in 2007 indicated that, in community settings, plain soap was no less effective than soaps containing triclosan for &quot;preventing infectious illness symptoms and reducing bacterial levels on the hands.&quot;.

Nonorganic antibiotics and organic biocides are effective alternatives to triclosan, such as silver and copper ions and nanoparticles.

==Policy==
In the US, triclosan is regulated as a pesticide by the EPA and as a drug by the FDA. The EPA generally regulates uses on solid surfaces, and FDA regulations cover uses in personal care products.

In 1974, the US FDA began the drug review monograph process for &quot;over-the-counter (OTC) topical antimicrobial products&quot;, including triclosan and triclocarban. The advisory panel first met on June 29, 1972, and the agency published its proposed rule on Sept 13, 1974. The initial rule applied to, &quot;OTC products containing antimicrobial ingredients for topical human use, which includes soaps, surgical scrubs, skin washes, skin cleansers, first aid preparations and additional products defined by the panel.&quot; The proposed rule lists dozens of products that were already on the market at the time and the firms that produced them.

In 1978 the FDA published a tentative final monograph (TFM) for topical antimicrobial products. The record was re-opened in March 1979 to take into account six comments the agency received during the period for submitting objections to the TFM, including new data submitted by Procter &amp; Gamble on the safety and effectiveness of triclocarban and by Ciba-Geigy on the proliferation of use of triclosan. The document states that, &quot;significant amounts of new and previously unconsidered data were submitted with each of the above petitions.&quot; It was re-opened again in October of that year to permit interested persons to submit further data establishing conditions for the safety, effectiveness and labeling of over-the-counter topical antimicrobial products for human use.

The next document issued was a proposed rule dated June 17, 1994, which states, the &quot;FDA is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the form of an amended tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which OTC topical health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. The FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative record for this rulemaking. The FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips.&quot; In the 1994 update to the rule, TCS was effectively removed from the drug category which made it available for use in consumer products.

In 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council forced the FDA to review triclosan after suing the agency for its inaction. Because the FDA prohibited hexachlorophene, a compound similar to triclosan, Halden and others argued that the FDA should also ban triclosan. On December 17, 2013, the FDA issued a draft rule revoking the generally recognized as safe status of triclosan as an ingredient in hand wash products, citing the need for additional studies of its potential endrocrine and developmental effects; impact on bacterial resistance; and carcinogenic potential.

On September 6, 2016, 44 years after its initial proposed rule, the FDA issued a final rule establishing that 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, used in over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic products intended for use with water (aka consumer antiseptic washes) are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE) and are misbranded, and are new drugs for which approved applications under section 505 of the FD&amp;C Act are required for marketing. Companies have one year to reformulate products without these ingredients, take them off the market or submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for the products. The 19 ingredients are:
* Cloflucarban
* Fluorosalan
* Hexachlorophene
* Hexylresorcinol
* Iodine complex (ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate)
* Iodine complex (phosphate ester of alkylaryloxy polyethylene glycol)
* Methylbenzethonium chloride
* Nonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine
* Phenol (greater than 1.5 percent)
* Phenol (less than 1.5 percent)
* Poloxamer-iodine complex
* Povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent
* Secondary amyltricresols
* Sodium oxychlorosene
* Tribromsalan
* Triclocarban
* Triclosan
* Triple dye (an antiseptic applied to the umbilical region of newborn infants)
* Undecoylium chloride iodine complex

In 2015 and 2016 FDA also issued proposed rules to amend the 1994 TFM regarding the safety and effectiveness of OTC health care antiseptics and OTC consumer antiseptic rubs.

The state of Minnesota took action against triclosan in advance of a federal rule. In May 2014, the governor signed a bill banning triclosan-containing products in the state. A &quot;CNN&quot; article quotes the new law, &quot;In order to prevent the spread of infectious disease and avoidable infections and to promote best practices in sanitation, no person shall offer for retail sale in Minnesota any cleaning product that contains triclosan and is used by consumers for sanitizing or hand and body cleansing.&quot; The law goes into effect on January 1, 2017. The exceptions to this rule are individual products that have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for consumer use.

In light of mounting evidence on the human health and ecotoxic effects of triclosan, some companies reformulated to remove it in advance of regulation: Colgate-Palmolive removed it from Palmolive Dish Soap and Softsoap in 2011 (but it remained in Colgate Total toothpaste until late 2018 or early 2019); Johnson &amp; Johnson removed it from baby products in 2012 and all products in 2015; Procter &amp; Gamble from all products in 2014; in 2014 it was removed from Clearasil and Avon began phasing it out; and Unilever removed it from skin care and cleansing products in 2015, and says oral care by 2017.

In Canada, triclosan is allowed in cosmetics, though FDA&#x27;s recent announcement has prompted Health Canada spokeswoman Maryse Durette to state in an e-mail to Toronto newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that, &quot;the government will publish a final assessment of the safety of triclosan &#x27;in the near future&#x27; and take further action &#x27;if warranted. Health Canada maintains a Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist, including hundreds of chemicals that are not allowed or whose use is restricted in cosmetics. The list states that triclosan is currently allowed in cosmetics up to 0.3%, and 0.03% in mouthwashes and other oral products with required warnings to avoid swallowing and not for use in children under the age of 12.

Triclosan was not approved by the European Commission as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 1 in January 2016. In the United States, manufacturers of products containing triclosan must indicate its presence on the label. In Europe, triclosan is regulated as a cosmetic preservative and must be listed on the label. Usage of triclosan in cosmetic products was restricted by the EU commission in 2014.

<text>Frank Hsieh Chang-ting (; born May 18, 1946) is a Taiwanese politician and former defense attorney who served as Ambassador of Taiwan to Japan from 2016 to 2024. A cofounder of the Democratic Progressive Party, he has served on the Taipei City Council, the Legislative Yuan, as the mayor of Kaohsiung City, and as the Premier of Taiwan (President of the Executive Yuan) under president Chen Shui-bian. Hsieh was the DPP nominee in the 2008 presidential election and was defeated by Ma Ying-jeou.

==Early life and education==
Born in Dadaocheng, Taipei, in 1946, Hsieh was a gymnast in high school and worked as a food vendor before college. He received a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from National Taiwan University. Hsieh then obtained a master&#x27;s degree and later completed doctoral coursework (all but dissertation) in jurisprudence at the Graduate School of Law of Kyoto University in Japan. He was a practicing attorney from 1969 to 1981, serving as a defense attorney in the martial courts following the Kaohsiung Incident of 1980.

==Rise in politics==
Prior to the 1986 establishment of the Democratic Progressive Party, Hsieh, Chen Shui-bian and Lin Cheng-chieh were known as the &quot;three musketeers&quot; of the tangwai movement. Hsieh cofounded the party and was the one who proposed its current name. He has also served as its chairman twice. A two-time Taipei City councilor from 1981 to 1988, Hsieh was then elected to the Legislative Yuan, the next year, and won reelection in 1992. Instead of running for reelection in the 1995 legislative elections, Hsieh chose to run in the 1994 Taipei mayoral election, and lost a primary to eventual winner Chen Shui-bian. In September 1995, Peng Ming-min and Hsieh were placed on the Democratic Progressive Party ticket for the 1996 presidential election. They finished second with 21.1% of the vote.

==Kaohsiung mayoralty==
In 1997, Hsieh successfully negotiated the surrender of the gunman in the Alexander family hostage crisis, raising his national profile.

To the surprise of many observers, Hsieh won the 1998 Kaohsiung City mayoral election, and defeated the Kuomintang incumbent, Wu Den-yih, by 4,565 votes. His administration focused on improving water quality in surrounding rivers as well as a general overhaul of the port of Kaohsiung. Hsieh supported placing the port, at the time run largely by the central government, under the jurisdiction of Kaohsiung City Government. Under Hsieh&#x27;s leadership efforts to clean up the heavily polluted Love River began in 1999, and ended in 2002. He was also largely responsible for the establishment of the Kaohsiung Metro. These achievements helped Hsieh earn strong support among Kaohsiung citizens. He was re-elected for a four-year term in 2002. Hsieh was projected to win easily, but People First Party chair James Soong publicly supported Kuomintang candidate Huang Jun-ying, which helped Huang earn more votes. Hsieh defeated Huang by 24,838 votes (3.22%).

==Premiership and aftermath==
In January 2005, Hsieh was appointed premier, forcing him to leave his post as mayor of Kaohsiung. Chen Chi-mai succeeded him as acting mayor.

Kuomintang politicians asked Hsieh to step down from the premiership shortly after the Kaohsiung MRT foreign workers scandal broke. Hsieh eventually resigned as premier in the aftermath of the 2005 &quot;Three-in-One&quot; elections, which the DPP lost in a landslide.

As the DPP candidate for the 2006 Taipei Mayoral election, Hsieh lost the race to KMT candidate Hau Lung-pin by 166,216 votes (12.92%). The loss was largely expected, as Taipei was considered a Kuomintang stronghold.

In February 2007, he led the Taiwanese delegation to the 55th annual United States National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., hosted by the U.S. Congressional Committee, with dignitaries including President George W. Bush.

==2008 presidential campaign==
Hsieh was frequently considered to be a leading contender for the DPP nomination in the 2008 presidential election, and formally announced his intention to run in the election on February 16, 2007. Hsieh was the second to formally declared candidacy, after the Kuomintang&#x27;s Ma Ying-jeou did so three days prior. Hsieh won 45% of the vote in the Democratic Progressive Party primary. A scheduled straw poll was cancelled after his three primary opponents all conceded defeat, and Hsieh was declared the DPP nominee. In July 2007, Hsieh visited the United States, branding it &quot;the journey of Love and Trust&quot; (). In September 2007, Hsieh openly declared that he was running for the presidency of the State of Taiwan (), saying that &quot;recogniz[ing] ourselves (the Taiwanese people) as a nation first and then fight[ing] for what we want during negotiations with other countries&quot; is important. As a result of the Kuomintang&#x27;s allegations of graft against Hsieh, prosecutors began an investigation of him in 2007. The investigation ended in September, when it was announced that Hsieh would not be charged with wrongdoing.

Regarding Ma Ying-jeou&#x27;s idea of a &quot;cross-strait common market,&quot; Hsieh states that if Taiwan only focuses on the economy, it will end up like Hong Kong and Macau, whose only goal in life is to make money. Hsieh believes that improving the economy is as important as preserving national dignity, and that the goal of economic development is more than just making money, but it is also improving the happiness of people.

Following the DPP&#x27;s poor performance in the 2008 legislative election, Hsieh replaced Chen Shui-bian as party chairman.

In January 2008, Hsieh accused candidate Ma Ying-jeou of having a United States green card. Subsequent investigations revealed that one of Ma&#x27;s sisters and one of his two daughters are US citizens. Hsieh stated that if Ma made public documented proof that he had renounced the green card, Hsieh would withdraw from the election.

The election was devastating to Hsieh and the DPP because he lost by a wider-than-expected margin of 17%. Hsieh had stated that if he lost this election, he would not run for office again. He resigned from the DPP chairmanship to take responsibility for the defeat. Tsai Ing-wen was elected as the new chairperson of the DPP.

In July 2010, Hsieh stood for the DPP&#x27;s central committee standing membership election and won.

==Cross-strait relations==

===2012 mainland visit===

In October 2012, Hsieh went to mainland China for five days as the highest-ranking DPP official ever to visit. However, the trip was made in no political capacity, but rather as a private citizen. He visited Xiamen and the Dongshan Islands in Fujian as well as Beijing on October 4–8.

He met with then State Councilor Dai Bingguo, then President Chen Yunlin of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and then Director Wang Yi of the Taiwan Affairs Office.

Although both sides agreed on the One-China policy, which governs Cross-Strait relations, Hsieh prefers to have a new consensus he called instead of the 1992 consensus.

Hsieh reiterated his &quot;Two Sides, Two Constitutions&quot; initiative while on an April 2013 visit to the United States, and urged Beijing to accept difference across the Taiwan Strait for both sides being able to facilitate dialogue.

===Hong Kong cross-strait forum===

In late June 2013, Hsieh attended a two-day forum on cross-strait relations entitled &quot;Development and Innovation of Cross-Strait Relations&quot; in Hong Kong. The forum was co-organized by Taiwan-based Taiwan Reform Foundation and Beijing-based Taiwan Research Institute. Before the forum, Hsieh attended a dinner hosted by Tung Chee Hwa, former Chief Executive of Hong Kong on Friday evening.

Hsieh said that mutual trust between DPP and Beijing was important and that all of the bilateral exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should benefit the public and address their needs. He also added that rebalancing cross-strait interactions is important as well. He once again reiterated his &#x27;constitutions with different interpretations&#x27; view that Taipei and Beijing can coexist if both sides respect each other&#x27;s constitutional legitimacy.

==ROC representative to Japan==
In March 2016, local media began reporting that Hsieh had accepted a position as Taiwan&#x27;s representative to Japan in Tsai Ing-wen&#x27;s administration. He announced the appointment in late April, and made his first official visit to Japan on June 9. Ko Shu-ling of the Kyodo News wrote favorably of Hsieh&#x27;s appointment, stating that the focus on Cross-Strait and Taiwan–United States relations under previous administrations seemed to be rolled back in favor of a &quot;southward&quot; policy, a goal of the Tsai presidency. Hsieh has discussed the possible lifting of Taiwanese restrictions on imports from Fukushima Prefecture, which had been put in place as a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the cause of meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Hsieh left his post in mid-August 2024, and is to be replaced by Lee I-yang.

==Personal life==
Hsieh is married to Yu Fang-chih (); together, they have a daughter and a son, who served in the military on Tungyin Island (Dongyin) and has served as Taipei City councilor since 2014. Hsieh&#x27;s mother died in 2007.

Hsieh and nine other Democratic Progressive Party politicians performed traditional Taiwanese songs on a re-release of the album &quot;Oh! Formosa&quot; in 2000. He later learned to play the ocarina, and released his own album in 2005.

Hsieh first claimed part-aboriginal descent in 2005, and stated that he enjoyed Bunun music.

He is also of seventh generation native Taiwanese of Hoklo descent; his ancestor Hsieh Kuang-yu () migrated from Tongshan, a village in Fujian province, the ancestral hometown being Zhao&#x27;an County (now part of Dongshan County).

<text>Li Denghui (, 1873–1947, courtesy name &quot;Téngfēi&quot; ()), also Lee Teng Hwee, was the president of Fudan University of Shanghai, 1917–1937.

==Biography==
Li&#x27;s ancestors came from the Tong&#x27;an District, Fujian, but he was born in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (present day Jakarta). He went to study in Singapore at the Anglo-Chinese School, where he became a Christian. He then continued at Yale University, becoming one of the first Nanyang Chinese to study there. He graduated with a BA degree in 1899.

Upon his return from the United States, Li founded an educational institute in Batavia, called Yale Institute. He also taught in a school founded by the Chinese Indonesians, Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan, with the hope of transforming the Chinese community overseas.

When he realized that he was not very successful at providing new kind of education for his people, Li went to Penang, Malaysia and met with a number of his friends with similar ideals. He then decided to move to Shanghai, China. He arrived in Shanghai in October 1904, organized the World Chinese Student Federation in July 1905 and became its first President, aiming to promote social justice in China, unite Chinese students studying overseas, and help members secure employment, medical care and legal advice. Similar associations were set up in Penang, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Hawaii and Singapore. Most of the original members of the federation were Christians and patriots.

At about the same time, Li became a supervisor of Fudan Public School. In 1913, when the founder of the school had to leave China, Li became its principal, teaching several subjects such as English, logic and philosophy. In 1917, when Fudan Public School became a university with a modern curriculum in the humanities, natural sciences and business as well as modern European languages, he became its first President.

<text>The Battle of Lade () was a naval battle which occurred during the Ionian Revolt, in 494 BC. It was fought between an alliance of the Ionian cities (joined by the Lesbians) and the Persian Empire of Darius the Great, and resulted in a decisive victory for the Persians which all but ended the revolt.

== History ==
The Ionian Revolt was triggered by the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them. In 499 BC, the then-tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great. Initially, in 498 BC, the Ionians went on the offensive, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, capturing Sardis, before suffering defeat at the Battle of Ephesus. The revolt then spread to Caria and Cyprus. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect. By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus.

The Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea, leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet gathered at the island of Lade, off the coast of Miletus. The Persians were uncertain of victory at Lade, so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect. Although this was unsuccessful at first, when the Persians finally attacked the Ionians, the Samian fleet accepted the Persian offer. As the Persian and Ionian fleets met, the Samians sailed away from the battle, causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line. Although the Chian contingent and a few other ships remained and fought bravely against the Persians, the battle was lost.

With the defeat at Lade, the Ionian Revolt was all but ended. The next year, the Persians reduced the last rebel strongholds, and began the process of bringing peace to the region. The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between ancient Greece and Persia, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his empire, he decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, would begin as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt.

== Background ==

In the dark age that followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, significant numbers of Greeks had emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the Aeolians, Dorians and Ionians. The Ionians had settled about the coasts of Lydia and Caria, founding the twelve cities which made up Ionia. These cities were Miletus, Myus and Priene in Caria; Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos, Clazomenae, Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia; and the islands of Samos and Chios. The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king Croesus, in around 560 BC. The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid Empire of Cyrus the Great. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects—such as the priesthood of Judea. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for the sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians&#x27; internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent streak, and have to be replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens&#x27; hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.

About 40 years after the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in the reign of the fourth Persian king, Darius the Great, the stand-in Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos, who asked him to take control of the island. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, proposing a joint attack on Naxos, to which Artaphernes assented.

The expedition sailed in the spring of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland. Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt. Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras&#x27;s personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians. Aristagoras&#x27;s actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and Aeolis and Doris), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.

Aristagoras had brought all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently realised that the Greeks would need other allies in order to fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he sailed to mainland Greece to try to recruit allies. He failed to persuade the Spartans, but the cities of Athens and Eretria agreed to support the rebellion. In the spring of 498 BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, for a total of twenty-five triremes set sail for Ionia. They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus.
This force was then guided by the Ephesians through mountains to Sardis, Artaphernes&#x27;s satrapal capital. The Greeks caught the Persians unawares, and were able to capture the lower city. However the lower city then caught fire, and the Greeks, demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus. The Persians troops in Asia Minor followed the Greek force, catching them outside Ephesus. It is clear that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians, and were completely routed in the ensuing battle at Ephesus. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships, and sailed back to Greece.

Despite these setbacks, the revolt spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis, and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion. For the next three years, the Persian army and navy were fully occupied with fighting the rebellions in Caria and Cyprus, and Ionia seems to have had an uneasy peace during these years. At the height of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing the untenability of his position, decided to abandon his position as leader of Miletus, and of the revolt, and he left Miletus. Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled.

By the sixth year of the revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The available land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, and the Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre. The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible that he was in overall command of this Persian offensive. Hearing of the approach of this force, the Ionians met at the Panionium (the sacred meeting ground), and decided not to attempt to fight on land, leaving the Milesians to defend their walls. Instead, they opted to gather every ship they could, and make for the island of Lade, off the coast of Miletus, in order to &quot;fight for Miletus at sea&quot;.

== Opposing forces ==
=== Greeks ===

The Ionian cities were joined in this battle by the Aeolians of Lesbos. Herodotus lists the number of ships provided by each state:

Herodotus gives the order of the Ionian battle line as being, from east to west; Miletus—Priene—Myus—Teos—Chios—Erythraea—Phocaea—Lesbos—Samos.

=== Persians ===
Herodotus says that there were 600 ships in the Persian fleet, provided by the Phoenicians (who were most eager to fight), the Egyptians, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued. The Persian fleet may have been commanded by the veteran Median general Datis; Persian records seem to suggest that he was sent by Darius to Ionia at around about the time of Lade. However, Herodotus does not name any Persian commanders in this campaign.

== Prelude ==
When the Persians arrived off the coast of Lade and learned the number of Ionian ships, they began to worry that they would not be able to defeat the Greeks, and feared Darius&#x27;s wrath should they fail. The Ionian tyrants who had been expelled at the beginning of the revolt were present, and according to Herodotus, they were now given instructions by the Persians: Men of Ionia, let each one of you now show that he has done good service to the king&#x27;s house; let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power. Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before. But if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in battle, they will be enslaved; we will make eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to Bactra, and hand over their land to others. The tyrants thus sent messages to their own kinsman, but the Ionians refused the offers. Critically, each group thought that only they had been approached—there does not seem to have been any discussion of this offer between the different contingents, and the possibility for treachery does not seem to have been realised.

The Ionians did however hold meetings to discuss the conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand on the edge of a razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished. Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.

== Battle ==
Soon after the rebellion against Dionysius, the Persian fleet moved to attack the Ionians, who sailed out to meet them. The ensuing battle was evidently confused, since Herodotus admits that &quot;which of the Ionians were brave men or cowards then in that sea-fight I cannot exactly say; for they all blame each other&quot;. It is nevertheless clear that very early on in the battle, the Samian contingent hoisted their sails, as had been agreed, and fled the battlefield. However, 11 Samian ships refused to desert the other Ionians, and remained at the battle. At some later date, the Samians erected a pillar in their marketplace commemorating the bravery and sacrifice of these crews. Seeing the Samians leave, their neighbours on the western wing, the Lesbians, also fled. The whole west-wing of the Ionian battle line thus very quickly collapsed. Other Ionian contingents also fled as the situation became more desperate.

Only the large Chian navy seems to have stood their ground, perhaps accompanied by a few other ships. They fought valiantly, but had huge casualties. Eventually the remaining Chian ships sailed away back to Chios, thereby ending the battle.

== Aftermath ==
With the defeat of the Ionian fleet, the revolt was effectively over. Miletus was closely invested, the Persians &quot;mining the walls and using every device against it, until they utterly captured it&quot;. According to Herodotus, most of the men were killed, and the women and children were enslaved. Archaeological evidence partially substantiates this, showing widespread signs of destruction, and abandonment of much of the city in the aftermath of Lade. However, some Milesians did remain in (or quickly returned to) Miletus, though the city would never recapture its former greatness. Miletus was thus notionally &quot;left empty of Milesians&quot;; the Persians took the city and coastal land for themselves, and gave the rest of the Milesian territory to Carians from Pedasus. The captive Milesians were brought before Darius in Susa, who settled them on the coast of the Persian Gulf, near the mouth of the Tigris.

Many Samians were appalled by the actions of their generals at Lade, and resolved to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces, returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle on the coast of Sicily, and took with them such Milesians as had escaped from the Persians. Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade. Meanwhile, Dionysius of Phocaea went to Sicily, and established himself as a pirate, preying on Carthaginian ships.

Most of Caria surrendered to the Persians in aftermath of Lade, although some strongholds had to be captured through force. The Persian fleet and army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last embers of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos and Tenedos and then moved over to the mainland, and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. The Persian army then re-conquered the settlements on the Asian side of the Propontis, while the fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn. With all of Asia Minor now firmly returned to Persian rule, the revolt was finally over.

For the Persians, the only unfinished business that remained by the end of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius&#x27;s empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria. The first Persian invasion of Greece thus began in the following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece, and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts, and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off Euboea. Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army, and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.

<doc id="349856" wikidata="Q1095520" url="?curid=349856" title="Pinetop Smith">
<text>Clarence &quot;Pinetop&quot; Smith (June 11, 1904 – March 15, 1929), was an American boogie-woogie style blues pianist. His hit tune &quot;Pinetop&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; featured rhythmic &quot;breaks&quot; that were an essential ingredient of ragtime music, but also a fundamental foreshadowing of rock and roll. The song was also the first known use of the term &quot;boogie woogie&quot; on a record, and cemented that term as the moniker for the genre.

==Career==
Smith was born in Troy, Alabama and raised in Birmingham, Alabama. He received his nickname as a child from his liking for climbing trees. In 1920 he moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he worked as an entertainer before touring on the Theatre Owners Booking Association (T.O.B.A.) vaudeville circuit, performing as a singer and comedian as well as a pianist. For a time, he worked as accompanist for blues singer Ma Rainey and Butterbeans and Susie.

In the mid-1920s, he was recommended by Cow Cow Davenport to J. Mayo Williams at Vocalion Records, and in 1928 he moved, with his wife and young son, to Chicago, Illinois to record. For a time he, Albert Ammons, and Meade Lux Lewis lived in the same rooming house.

On December 29, 1928, he recorded his influential &quot;Pine Top&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot;, one of the first &quot;boogie woogie&quot; style recordings to make a hit, and which cemented the name for the style. It was also the first recording to have the phrase &#x27;boogie woogie&#x27; in the song&#x27;s title. Smith talks over the recording, telling how to dance to the number. He said he originated the number at a house-rent party in St. Louis, Missouri. Smith was the first ever to direct &quot;the girl with the red dress on&quot; to &quot;not move a peg&quot; until told to &quot;shake that thing&quot; and &quot;mess around&quot;. Similar lyrics are heard in many later songs, including &quot;Mess Around&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; by Ray Charles.

Smith was scheduled to make another recording session for Vocalion in 1929, but died from a gunshot wound in a dance-hall fight in Chicago the day before the session. Sources differ as to whether he was the intended recipient of the bullet. &quot;I saw Pinetop spit blood&quot; was a headline in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine in 1939.

No photographs of Smith are known to exist.

==Influence==
Smith was acknowledged by other boogie-woogie pianists such as Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson as a key influence, and he gained posthumous fame when &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot; was arranged for big band and recorded by Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra in 1938. Although not immediately successful, &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot; was so popular during and after World War II that it became Dorsey&#x27;s best-selling record, with over five million copies sold. Bing Crosby (recorded January 21, 1946 with Lionel Hampton&#x27;s Orchestra) and Count Basie also issued their versions of the song.

From the 1950s, Joe Willie Perkins became universally known as &quot;Pinetop Perkins&quot; for his recording of &quot;Pinetop&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot;. Perkins later became Muddy Waters&#x27;s pianist. When he was in his nineties, he recorded a song on his 2004 album &quot;Ladies&#x27; Man&quot;, which played on the by-then common misconception that he had written &quot;Pinetop&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot;.

Ray Charles adapted &quot;Pine Top&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; for his song &quot;Mess Around&quot;, for which the authorship was credited to &quot;A. Nugetre&quot;, Ahmet Ertegun.

In 1975, the Bob Thiele Orchestra recorded a modern jazz album called &quot;I Saw Pinetop Spit Blood&quot;, which included a treatment of &quot;Pinetop&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; as well as the title song.

Gene Taylor recorded a version of &quot;Pinetop&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; on his eponymous 2003 album.

Claes Oldenburg, the pop artist, proposed a Pinetop Smith Monument in his book &quot;Proposals for Monuments and Buildings 1965–69&quot;. Oldenburg described the monument as &quot;a wire extending the length of North Avenue, west from Clark Street, along which at intervals runs an electric impulse colored blue so that there&#x27;s one blue line as far as the eye can see. Pinetop Smith invented boogie woogie blues at the corner of North and Larrabee, where he finally was murdered: the electric wire is &#x27;blue&#x27; and dangerous.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
Smith was a posthumous 1991 inductee of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame.

<text>The Newfoundland is a large breed of working dog. They can be black, grey, brown, or black and white. However, in the Dominion of Newfoundland, before it became part of Canada, only black and Landseer (white-and-black) coloured dogs were considered to be proper members of the breed. They were originally bred and used as working dogs for fishermen in Newfoundland.

They excel at water rescue/lifesaving because of their muscular build, thick double coat, webbed paws, and swimming abilities.

==Description==
===Appearance===
Newfoundlands (&#x27;Newfs&#x27; or &#x27;Newfies&#x27;) have webbed paws and a water-resistant coat. Males normally weigh , and females , placing them in the &quot;Giant&quot; weight range; but some Newfoundlands have been known to weigh over — and the largest on record weighed and measured over from nose to tail, ranking it among the largest of dog breeds. They may grow up to tall at the shoulder.

The American Kennel Club (AKC) standard colours of the Newfoundland are black, brown, grey, and white-and-black (sometimes referred to as a Landseer). Other colours are possible but are not considered rare or more valuable. The Kennel Club (KC) permits only black, brown, and white/black; the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) permits only black and white/black. The &quot;Landseer&quot; pattern is named after the artist Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, who featured them in many of his paintings. Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) consider the ECT Landseer (&quot;European Continental Type&quot;) to be a separate breed. It is a taller, more narrow white dog with black markings not bred with a Newfoundland.

The Newfoundland&#x27;s extremely large bones give it mass, while its large musculature gives it the power it needs to take on rough ocean waves and powerful tides. These dogs have huge lung capacity for swimming extremely long distances and a thick, oily, and waterproof double coat which protects them from the chill of icy waters.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2005 Swedish study of insurance data found 62% of Newfoundland dogs died by the age of 10, higher than the overall rate of 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.

Several conditions the Newfoundland is predisposed to include: acral lick dermatitis, allergic skin disease, hypothyroidism, ichthyosis, and primary seborrhoea.

A study of referrals to a veterinary clinic in the US found the Newfoundland to be predisposed to dilated cardiomyopathy, with 1.3% of dogs having the condition. A Swedish study found 16% of Newfoundlands with DCM to have ventricular ectopy. An English study found 77% of Newfoundlands with DCM to have atrial fibrillation.

An American study reviewing over a million cases presented to 27 veterinary teaching hospitals in North America found the Newfoundland to be the most prediposed to canine hip dysplasia, with 17.16% of dogs having the condition compared to 3.52% overall. This same study found the Newfoundland to also have the highest prevalence of cranial cruciate ligament deficiency (CCLD) with 8.9% of dogs having the condition compared to an overall rate of 2.55%. For dogs diagnosed with both conditions the Newfoundland once again had the highest prevalence with 2.86% having both hip dysplasia and CCLD compared to 0.3% overall. Another American study of over a million and a quarter of a million hip and elbow evaluation records in dogs over the age of 2 years found a prevalence of 24.8% for hip dysplasia — the highest in the study — and 22.7% for elbow dysplasia.

The Newfoundland is predisposed to gastric dilation volvulus (GDV). In a survey of breed club members in the UK it was found that 10% of Newfoundland deaths were due to GDV compared to the overall rate of 2.5%, although the study reported bias due to its voluntary nature and small sample size.

==History==
===Origin===
Genomic analysis indicates that Newfoundlands are related to the Irish water spaniel, Labrador Retriever, and Curly-Coated Retriever.

The Newfoundland was originally bred and used as a working dog for fishermen in Newfoundland.

In the early 1880s, fishermen and explorers from Ireland and England travelled to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, where they described two main types of working dogs. One was heavily built, large with a longish coat, and the other medium-sized in build – an active, smooth-coated water dog. The heavier breed was known as the greater Newfoundland, or Newfoundland. The smaller breed was known as the lesser Newfoundland, or St. John&#x27;s water dog. The St. John&#x27;s water dog became the founding breed of modern retrievers. Both breeds were used as working dogs to pull fishnets, with the Greater Newfoundland also being used to haul carts and other equipment.

It has also been proposed that the original Newfoundland that lived on the island was smaller; in theory, the smaller landrace was bred with mastiffs when sold to the English, and the English version was popularized to become what is thought of as a Newfoundland today.

===Reputation===

The breed&#x27;s working role was varied. Many tales have been told of the courage displayed by Newfoundlands in adventuring and lifesaving exploits. Over the last two centuries, this has inspired a number of artists, who have portrayed the dogs in paint, stone, bronze, and porcelain. One famous Newfoundland was named Seaman, one of the most traveled dogs in human history, who accompanied American explorers Lewis and Clark on their expedition from the Mississippi to the Pacific and back, a journey that took three years. A statue of him is included in many Lewis and Clark monuments. Many children&#x27;s books have been written about him.

The breed prospered in the United Kingdom, until 1914 and again in 1939, when its numbers were almost fatally depleted by wartime restrictions. Since the 1950s there has been a steady increase in numbers and popularity, despite the fact that the Newfoundland&#x27;s great size and fondness for mud and water makes it unsuitable as a pet for many households.

===Water rescue===
During the Discovery Channel&#x27;s second day of coverage of the American Kennel Club Eukanuba National Championship on December 3, 2006, anchor Bob Goen reported that Newfoundlands exhibit a very strong propensity to rescue people from water. Goen stated that one Newfoundland alone aided the rescue of 63 shipwrecked sailors. Today, kennel clubs across the United States host Newfoundland Rescue Demonstrations, as well as offering classes in the field. Many harbour boat tours in St John&#x27;s have a dog on board for local charm as well as for passenger safety.
* An unnamed Newfoundland is credited for saving Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815. During his famous escape from exile on the island of Elba, rough seas knocked Napoleon overboard. A fisherman&#x27;s dog jumped into the sea, and kept Napoleon afloat until he could reach safety.
* In 1828, Ann Harvey of Isle aux Morts, her father, her brother, and a Newfoundland named Hairyman saved over 160 Irish immigrants from the wreck of the brig &quot;Despatch&quot;.
* In 1881 in Melbourne, Australia, a Newfoundland named Nelson helped rescue Thomas Brown, a cab driver who was swept away by flood waters in Swanston Street on the night of November 15. While little is known about what became of Nelson, a copper dog collar engraved with his name has survived and 130 years after the rescue it was acquired by the National Museum of Australia and is now part of the National Historical Collection.
* In the early 20th century, a dog that is thought to have been a Newfoundland saved 92 people who were on the SS &quot;Ethie&quot; which was wrecked off of the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland during a blizzard. The dog retrieved a rope thrown out into the turbulent waters by those on deck, and brought the rope to shore to people waiting on the beach. A breeches buoy was attached to the rope, and all those aboard the ship were able to get across to the shore including an infant in a mailbag. Wreckage of the ship can still be seen in Gros Morne National Park. E. J. Pratt&#x27;s poem &quot;Carlo&quot;, in the November 1920 issue of the &quot;Canadian Forum&quot;, commemorates this dog.
* In 1995, a 10-month-old Newfoundland named Boo saved a hearing-impaired man from drowning in the Yuba River in Northern California. The man fell into the river while dredging for gold. Boo noticed the struggling man as he and his owner were walking along the river. The Newfoundland instinctively dove into the river, took the drowning man by the arm, and brought him to safety. According to Janice Anderson, the Newfoundland&#x27;s breeder, Boo had received no formal training in water rescue.

Further evidence of Newfoundlands&#x27; ability to rescue or support life-saving activities was cited in a 2007 article by the BBC.

===Relationship to other breeds===
The Newfoundland shares many physical traits with mastiffs and Molosser-type dogs, such as the St. Bernard and English Mastiff, including stout legs, massive heads with very broad snouts, a thick bull-like neck, and a very sturdy bone structure. Many St. Bernards have Newfoundlands in their ancestry. Newfoundlands were brought and introduced to the St. Bernard breed in the 18th century when the population was threatened by an epidemic of canine distemper. They share many characteristics of many livestock guardian dog breeds, such as the Great Pyrenees.

Because of their strength, Newfoundlands were part of the foundation stock of the Leonberger (which excelled at water rescue and was imported by the Canadian government for that purpose); and the now-extinct Moscow Water Dog, a failed attempt at creating a lifesaving dog by the Russian state kennel—the unfortunate outcross with the Caucasian Shepherd Dog begat a dog more adept at biting than rescuing.

==Famous Newfoundlands==
===Napoleon the Wonder Dog===
A famous all-black Newfoundland performed as the star attraction in Van Hare&#x27;s Magic Circus from 1862 and for many years thereafter in one of England&#x27;s founding circus acts, traveling throughout Europe. The circus dog was known as the &quot;Thousand Guinea Dog Napoleon&quot; or &quot;Napoleon the Wonder Dog&quot;. The circus owner, G. Van Hare, trained other Newfoundland dogs to perform a steeplechase routine with baboons dressed up as jockeys to ride them. Nonetheless, his &quot;wizard dog&quot; Napoleon was his favourite and held a special position in the Magic Circus. Napoleon would compete at jumping against human rivals, leaping over horses from a springboard, and dancing to music.

Napoleon the Wonder Dog became a wildly popular act in London from his debut at the Pavilion Theatre on April 4, 1862, and onward until his untimely death many years later when he slipped and fell during a circus practice session. At the peak of his fame, his performance was described in London&#x27;s Illustrated Sporting News and Theatrical and Musical Review as follows: &quot;Synopsis of his entertainment:— He spells his own name with letters, also that of the Prince of Wales; and when he is asked what he would say of her Most Gracious Majesty, he puts down letters to form &#x27;God save the Queen.&#x27; He plays any gentleman a game of cards and performs the celebrated three-card trick upon which his master backs him at 100 to 1. Also &#x27;The Disappearance,&#x27; a la Robin. He performs in a circus the same as a trick horse, &quot;en liberté&quot;, giving the Spanish trot to music, also leaping over bars, through balloons, with numerous other tricks of a most interesting character.&quot;

When Napoleon the Wonder Dog died at the age of 12 years old, his death was announced in a number of British newspapers, including the Sheffield Daily Telegraph, which mentioned the loss on May 5, 1868, as follows: &quot;DEATH OF A CELEBRATED FOUR-FOOTED ARTISTE. — Mr. Van Hare&#x27;s renowned dog, Napoleon, designated &#x27;The Wizard Dog,&#x27; died on 24th ult., aged twelve years. He was a noble specimen of the Newfoundland breed (weighing near 200 lbs.) for which he took the prize at the first Agricultural Hall Dog Show. Besides his magnificent appearance and symmetry, he was the most extraordinary sagacious and highly-trained animal ever known. He is now being preserved and beautifully mounted by the celebrated naturalist, Mr. Edwin Ward. — Era.&quot;

===Other famous Newfoundlands===
* Bashaw (Matthew Cotes Wyatt): the Earl of Dudley&#x27;s favourite dog, and the inspiration for a sculpture by Matthew Cotes Wyatt at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London
* Bilbo: a lifeguard Newfoundland on Sennen beach in Cornwall—credited with saving three lives
* Boatswain: pet of English poet Lord Byron and the subject of his poem &quot;Epitaph to a Dog&quot;. Byron attempted to nurse Boatswain back to health when the dog contracted rabies, but was unsuccessful. When Boatswain died, Byron constructed a monument for him at Newstead Abbey.
* Bouncer: presented by the children of Newfoundland, with a dog-cart, as a gift to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later George V and Queen Mary), during their visit to the colony in 1901
* Frank: unofficial mascot of the Orphan Brigade during the American Civil War
* Gander: the World War II mascot of the Royal Rifles of Canada, also known as &quot;Sergeant Gander&quot;, which was killed in action at the Battle of Hong Kong when he carried a grenade away from wounded soldiers. For this, he was awarded the PDSA Dickin Medal retroactively in 2000. A memorial statue can be viewed at the Gander Heritage Memorial Park (Gander, NL).
* Gipsy: Lemuel and Emma Wilmarth&#x27;s dog which saved the latter from drowning, lived to be 23 years old, and inspired a poem by ASPCA founder Henry Bergh.
* Luath: J. M. Barrie&#x27;s Landseer Newfoundland and the inspiration for &quot;Nana,&quot; the Darling children&#x27;s nurse in Peter Pan.
* Neptune: old Newfoundland dog gifted by Jane Franklin to her husband Sir John Franklin for Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition. Inuit accounts suggest the dog was alive and hunting caribou with the last survivors in the 1850s, years after the expedition was last seen by Europeans.
* Rigel: claimed pet of first officer William Murdoch aboard the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Murdoch went down with the ship, but Rigel swam for three hours next to a lifeboat until it was rescued by the RMS &quot;Carpathia&quot;. Rigel is renowned as a hero alerting the &quot;Carpathia&quot;″s captain of the weakened survivors before the ship hit them. Rigel was adopted by crewman Jonas Briggs. Its existence and the story has been dismissed as a hoax.
* Sable Chief: World War I mascot of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment
* Seaman: his name once misread as &quot;Scannon&quot;, this dog travelled with the Lewis and Clark Expedition from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean and back, a three-year trip (1804 to 1806). His collar tag, now lost but once in a museum, read:
* Swansea Jack: famous Welsh rescue dog identified as a Newfoundland, but which had an appearance more like a modern-day Flat-Coated Retriever

<text>Palaeogeography (or paleogeography) is the study of historical geography, generally physical landscapes. Palaeogeography can also include the study of human or cultural environments. When the focus is specifically on landforms, the term paleogeomorphology is sometimes used instead. Paleomagnetism, paleobiogeography, and tectonic history are among its main tools.

Palaeogeography yields information that is crucial to scientific understanding in a variety of contexts. For example, palaeogeographical analysis of sedimentary basins plays a key role in the field of petroleum geology, because ancient geomorphological environments of the Earth&#x27;s surface are preserved in the stratigraphic record. Palaeogeographers also study the sedimentary environment associated with fossils for clues to the evolutionary development of extinct species. Palaeogeography is furthermore crucial to the understanding of palaeoclimatology, due to the impact of the positions of continents and oceans on influencing global and regional climates.

Palaeogeographical evidence contributed to the development of continental drift theory, and continues to inform current plate tectonic theories, yielding information about the shape and latitudinal location of supercontinents such as Pangaea and ancient oceans such as Panthalassa, thus enabling reconstruction of prehistoric continents and oceans.

<text>The Battle of Ankara or Angora () was fought on 28 July 1402, at the Çubuk plain near Ankara, between the forces of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I and the emir of the Timurid Empire, Timur. The battle was a major victory for Timur, and it led to the Ottoman Interregnum.

==Background==
Timur, a Turco-Mongol from Transoxiana (now Uzbekistan), had built an empire in Central Asia over the years, and became the most powerful ruler in Central Asia since Genghis Khan. He sought to rebuild the once great Mongol Empire. In the 1380s and 1390s, he invaded and conquered parts of Persia (including Azerbaijan and Upper Mesopotamia), ravaged southern Russia and Ukraine (1395–96), and sacked Delhi (1398). Although there had been tensions between the Ottomans and Mongols, nothing would warrant a war, until Bayezid demanded tribute from an emir loyal to Timur, which he understood to be a personal affront and a reason for war. In 1400–01 Timur took Sivas from the Ottomans, parts of Syria from the Mamluks, and next directed towards Anatolia.

Meanwhile, in 1402, the Ottomans had been campaigning in Europe. Bayezid broke off the blockade of Constantinople and marched to Ankara after Timur again moved his army to the southeast in the summer of 1402.

==Troops==
It is estimated that the Timurid army counted 140,000, mostly cavalry, and also 32 war elephants. Bayezid&#x27;s army numbered 85,000. Historical sources exaggerated the number of troops to unrealistic proportions according to modern historians: Ahmad ibn Arabshah claimed 800,000 Timurid troops, while a German witness claimed 1.6 million, for instance.

The Ottoman force included contingents under his sons, Ghazis, Janissaries, Anatolian Muslim vassals, and various European (Balkan Christian) vassals. Among Serbian vassals participating were Stefan Lazarević, Vuk Lazarević, Đurađ Branković and his brother Grgur Branković, and among Albanian were Koja Zakarija, Demetrius Jonima, Gjon Kastrioti, and probably Tanush Dukagjini. Christian vassals that did not participate include Zetan Konstantin Balšić. A quarter of the Ottoman troops were recently conquered Tatars.

==Battle positioning==
Bayezid reluctantly withdrew his forces from the blockade of Constantinople and marched them through the midsummer heat. When they arrived, they were tired and thirsty, but were allowed no time to rest or recuperate. Bayezid was advised by his generals to take up defensive positions and, when Timur&#x27;s forces pushed back the Ottomans, to withdraw into the mountains and force Timur to break ranks and attempt to hunt the Ottomans in their own terrain during the midsummer heat. Bayezid instead chose to take an offensive stance and marched eastward. Advancing Ottoman scouts found no traces of the Timurids, who secretly marched southwest, rested, and were situated to the rear of the Ottomans. The Timurids encamped in the same locations that the Ottomans had previously occupied, making use of abandoned tents and water sources. The Ottoman army arrived near Ankara 28 July 1402 with Bayezid commanding the centre with Janissaries, his son Suleyman the left flank with the best troops, Stefan Lazarević the right with the Balkan troops, and his son Mehmed the rear guard.

In the Timurid army, Timur commanded the centre, his sons Miran and Rukh the right and left, respectively, and his grandsons the vanguard.

==Battle==
The battle began with a large-scale attack from the Ottomans, countered by swarms of arrows from the Timurid horse archers. Several thousand were killed and many surrendered to Timur. Stefan Lazarević and his knights successfully fought off the Timurid assaults and cut through the Mongol ranks three times. Each time Stefan advised Bayezid to break out with him, Bayezid declined to do so. But the Serbians managed to save one of Bayezid&#x27;s sons and the treasury from the Mongols and made their way to Constantinople. The Serbian troops wore heavy black plate armour which was very effective against the Timurid arrows. Timur admired the Serbian troops who according to him &quot;fight like lions&quot;. During the battle the main water supply of both armies, Çubuk creek, was diverted to an off-stream reservoir near the town of Çubuk by Timur, which left the Ottoman army with no water. The final battle took place at Catal hill, dominating the Çubuk valley. The Ottoman army, both thirsty and tired, was defeated, though Bayezid managed to escape to the nearby mountains with a few hundred horsemen. However, Timur had the mountains surrounded and, heavily outnumbering Bayezid, soon captured him. He died in captivity three months later. Already heavily outnumbered, the Ottoman army was further weakened by the desertion of the Black Tatars and the Sipahis from the Anatolian beyliks, who left Bayezid&#x27;s side and joined Timur&#x27;s forces.

==Aftermath==

After the battle, Timur moved through western Anatolia to the Aegean coast, where he besieged and took the city of Smyrna, a stronghold of the Christian Knights Hospitalers.
The battle was catastrophic for the Ottoman state, fracturing what remained and bringing almost total collapse of the empire. This resulted in a civil war among Bayezid&#x27;s sons. The Ottoman civil war continued for another 11 years (1413) following the Battle of Ankara.

The battle is also significant in Ottoman history as being the only time a Sultan was captured in person.

<text>Server Message Block (SMB) is a communication protocol used to share files, printers, serial ports, and miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network. On Microsoft Windows, the SMB implementation consists of two vaguely named Windows services: &quot;Server&quot; (ID: codice_1) and &quot;Workstation&quot; (ID: codice_2). It uses NTLM or Kerberos protocols for user authentication. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.

SMB was originally developed in 1983 by Barry A. Feigenbaum at IBM to share access to files and printers across a network of systems running IBM&#x27;s IBM PC DOS. In 1987, Microsoft and 3Com implemented SMB in LAN Manager for OS/2, at which time SMB used the NetBIOS service atop the NetBIOS Frames protocol as its underlying transport. Later, Microsoft implemented SMB in Windows NT 3.1 and has been updating it ever since, adapting it to work with newer underlying transports: TCP/IP and NetBT. SMB over QUIC was introduced in Windows Server 2022. 

In 1996, Microsoft published a version of SMB 1.0 with minor modifications under the Common Internet File System (CIFS ) moniker. CIFS was compatible with even the earliest incarnation of SMB, including LAN Manager&#x27;s. It supports symbolic links, hard links, and larger file size, but none of the features of SMB 2.0 and later. Microsoft&#x27;s proposal, however, remained an Internet Draft and never achieved standard status. Microsoft has since discontinued the CIFS moniker but continues developing SMB and publishing subsequent specifications. Samba is a free software reimplementation of the SMB protocol and the Microsoft extensions to it.

== Features ==
Server Message Block (SMB) enables file sharing, printer sharing, network browsing, and inter-process communication (through named pipes) over a computer network. SMB serves as the basis for Microsoft&#x27;s Distributed File System implementation.

SMB relies on the TCP and IP protocols for transport. This combination allows file sharing over complex, interconnected networks, including the public Internet. The SMB server component uses TCP port 445. SMB originally operated on NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2 - NetBIOS Frames or NBF - and over IPX/SPX, and later on NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT), but Microsoft has since deprecated these protocols. On NetBT, the server component uses three TCP or UDP ports: 137 (NETBIOS Name Service), 138 (NETBIOS Datagram Service), and 139 (NETBIOS Session Service).

In Microsoft Windows, two vaguely named Windows services implement SMB. The &quot;Server&quot; service (ID: codice_1) is in charge of serving shared resources. The &quot;Workstation&quot; service (ID: codice_2) maintains the computer name and helps access shared resources on other computers. SMB uses the Kerberos protocol to authenticate users against Active Directory on Windows domain networks. On simpler, peer-to-peer networks, SMB uses the NTLM protocol.

Windows NT 4.0 SP3 and later can digitally sign SMB messages to prevent some man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing may be configured individually for incoming SMB connections (by the &quot;LanmanServer&quot; service) and outgoing SMB connections (by the &quot;LanmanWorkstation&quot; service). The default setting for Windows domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and later is to not allow unsigned incoming connections. As such, earlier versions of Windows that do not support SMB signing from the get-go (including Windows 9x) cannot connect to a Windows Server 2003 domain controller.

SMB supports opportunistic locking (see below) on files in order to improve performance. Opportunistic locking support has changed with each Windows Server release.

=== Opportunistic locking ===
In the SMB protocol, opportunistic locking is a mechanism designed to improve performance by controlling caching of network files by the client. Unlike traditional locks, opportunistic lock (OpLocks) are not strictly file locking or used to provide mutual exclusion.

There are four types of opportunistic locks.

; Batch Locks: Batch OpLocks were created originally to support a particular behavior of DOS batch file execution operation in which the file is opened and closed many times in a short period, which is a performance problem. To solve this, a client may ask for an OpLock of type &quot;batch&quot;. In this case, the client delays sending the close request and if a subsequent open request is given, the two requests cancel each other.
; Level-1 OpLocks / Exclusive Locks: When an application opens in &quot;shared mode&quot; a file hosted on an SMB server which is not opened by any other process (or other clients) the client receives an exclusive OpLock from the server. This means that the client may now assume that it is the only process with access to this particular file, and the client may now cache all changes to the file before committing it to the server. This is a performance improvement, since fewer round-trips are required in order to read and write to the file. If another client/process tries to open the same file, the server sends a message to the client (called a &quot;break&quot; or &quot;revocation&quot;) which invalidates the exclusive lock previously given to the client. The client then flushes all changes to the file.
; Level-2 OpLocks: If an exclusive OpLock is held by a client and a locked file is opened by a third party, the client has to relinquish its exclusive OpLock to allow the other client&#x27;s write/read access. A client may then receive a &quot;Level 2 OpLock&quot; from the server. A Level 2 OpLock allows the caching of read requests but excludes write caching.
; Filter OpLocks: Added in Windows NT 4.0, Filter Oplocks are similar to Level 2 OpLocks but prevent sharing-mode violations between file open and lock reception. Microsoft advises use of Filter OpLocks only where it is important to allow multiple readers and Level 2 OpLocks in other circumstances. Clients holding an OpLock do not really hold a lock on the file, instead they are notified via a &quot;break&quot; when another client wants to access the file in a way inconsistent with their lock. The other client&#x27;s request is held up while the break is being processed.
; Breaks: In contrast with the SMB protocol&#x27;s &quot;standard&quot; behavior, a break request may be sent &quot;from&quot; server &quot;to&quot; client. It informs the client that an OpLock is no longer valid. This happens, for example, when another client wishes to open a file in a way that invalidates the OpLock. The first client is then sent an OpLock break and required to send all its local changes (in case of batch or exclusive OpLocks), if any, and acknowledge the OpLock break. Upon this acknowledgment the server can reply to the second client in a consistent manner.

=== Performance ===
The use of the SMB protocol has often correlated with a significant increase in broadcast traffic on a network. However the SMB itself does not use broadcasts—the broadcast problems commonly associated with SMB actually originate with the NetBIOS service location protocol. By default, a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 server used NetBIOS to advertise and locate services. NetBIOS functions by broadcasting services available on a particular host at regular intervals. While this usually makes for an acceptable default in a network with a smaller number of hosts, increased broadcast traffic can cause problems as the number of hosts on the network increases. The implementation of name resolution infrastructure in the form of Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) or Domain Name System (DNS) resolves this problem. WINS was a proprietary implementation used with Windows NT 4.0 networks, but brought about its own issues and complexities in the design and maintenance of a Microsoft network.

Since the release of Windows 2000, the use of WINS for name resolution has been deprecated by Microsoft, with hierarchical Dynamic DNS now configured as the default name resolution protocol for all Windows operating systems. Resolution of (short) NetBIOS names by DNS requires that a DNS client expand short names, usually by appending a connection-specific DNS suffix to its DNS lookup queries. WINS can still be configured on clients as a secondary name resolution protocol for interoperability with legacy Windows environments and applications. Further, Microsoft DNS servers can forward name resolution requests to legacy WINS servers in order to support name resolution integration with legacy (pre-Windows 2000) environments that do not support DNS.

Network designers have found that latency has a significant impact on the performance of the SMB 1.0 protocol, that it performs more poorly than other protocols like FTP. Monitoring reveals a high degree of &quot;chattiness&quot; and a disregard of network latency between hosts. For example, a VPN connection over the Internet will often introduce network latency. Microsoft has explained that performance issues come about primarily because SMB 1.0 is a block-level rather than a streaming protocol, that was originally designed for small LANs; it has a block size that is limited to 64K, SMB signing creates an additional overhead and the TCP window size is not optimized for WAN links. Solutions to this problem include the updated SMB 2.0 protocol, Offline Files, TCP window scaling and WAN optimization devices from various network vendors that cache and optimize SMB 1.0 and 2.0.

== History ==

=== SMB 1.0 ===
Barry Feigenbaum originally designed SMB at IBM in early 1983 with the aim of turning DOS INT 21h local file access into a networked file system. Microsoft made considerable modifications to the most commonly used version and included SMB support in the LAN Manager operating system it had started developing for OS/2 with 3Com around 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;theregister/2018/06/08/smb1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;borncity/2017/06/15/retire-smbv1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thurrott/265909&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft continued to add features to the protocol in Windows for Workgroups () and in later versions of Windows. LAN Manager authentication was implemented based on the original legacy SMB specification&#x27;s requirement to use IBM &quot;LAN Manager&quot; passwords, but implemented DES in a flawed manner that allowed passwords to be cracked. Later, Kerberos authentication was also added. The Windows domain logon protocols initially used 40-bit encryption outside of the United States, because of export restrictions on stronger 128-bit encryption (subsequently lifted in 1996 when President Bill Clinton signed ).

SMB 1.0 (or SMB1) was originally designed to run on NetBIOS Frames (NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2). Since then, it has been adapted to NetBIOS over IPX/SPX (NBX), and NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT). Also, since Windows 2000, SMB runs on TCP using TCP port 445, a feature known as &quot;direct host SMB&quot;. There is still a thin layer (similar to the Session Message packet of NetBT&#x27;s Session Service) between SMB and TCP. Windows Server 2003, and legacy NAS devices use SMB1 natively.

SMB1 is an extremely chatty protocol, which is not such an issue on a local area network (LAN) with low latency. It becomes very slow on wide area networks (WAN) as the back and forth handshake of the protocol magnifies the inherent high latency of such a network. Later versions of the protocol reduced the high number of handshake exchanges. One approach to mitigating the inefficiencies in the protocol is to use WAN optimization products such as those provided by Riverbed, Silver Peak, or Cisco. A better approach is to upgrade to a later version of SMB. This includes upgrading both NAS devices as well as Windows Server 2003. The most effective method to identify SMB1 traffic is with a network analyzer tool, such as Wireshark. Microsoft also provides an auditing tool in Windows Server 2016 to track down devices that use SMB1.

Microsoft has marked SMB1 as deprecated in June 2013. Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 version 1709 do not have SMB1 installed by default.

=== CIFS ===
In 1996, when Sun Microsystems announced WebNFS, Microsoft launched an initiative to rename SMB to Common Internet File System (CIFS) and added more features, including support for symbolic links, hard links, larger file sizes, and an initial attempt at supporting direct connections over TCP port 445 without requiring NetBIOS as a transport (a largely experimental effort that required further refinement). Microsoft submitted some partial specifications as Internet Drafts to the IETF. These submissions have since expired.

=== SMB 2.0 ===
Microsoft introduced a new version of the protocol (SMB 2.0 or SMB2) in 2006 with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Although the protocol is proprietary, its specification has been published to allow other systems to interoperate with Microsoft operating systems that use the new protocol.

SMB2 reduces the &#x27;chattiness&#x27; of the SMB 1.0 protocol by reducing the number of commands and subcommands from over a hundred to just nineteen. It has mechanisms for pipelining, that is, sending additional requests before the response to a previous request arrives, thereby improving performance over high-latency links. It adds the ability to compound multiple actions into a single request, which significantly reduces the number of round-trips the client needs to make to the server, improving performance as a result. SMB1 also has a compounding mechanism—known as AndX—to compound multiple actions, but Microsoft clients rarely use AndX. It also introduces the notion of &quot;durable file handles&quot;: these allow a connection to an SMB server to survive brief network outages, as are typical in a wireless network, without having to incur the overhead of re-negotiating a new session.

SMB2 includes support for symbolic links. Other improvements include caching of file properties, improved message signing with HMAC SHA-256 hashing algorithm and better scalability by increasing the number of users, shares and open files per server among others. The SMB1 protocol uses 16-bit data sizes, which amongst other things, limits the maximum block size to 64K. SMB2 uses 32- or 64-bit wide storage fields, and 128 bits in the case of file-handles, thereby removing previous constraints on block sizes, which improves performance with large file transfers over fast networks.

Windows Vista/Server 2008 and later operating systems use SMB2 when communicating with other machines also capable of using SMB2. SMB1 continues in use for connections with older versions of Windows, as well various vendors&#x27; NAS solutions. Samba 3.5 also includes experimental support for SMB2. Samba 3.6 fully supports SMB2, except the modification of user quotas using the Windows quota management tools.

When SMB2 was introduced it brought a number of benefits over SMB1 for third party implementers of SMB protocols. SMB1, originally designed by IBM, was reverse engineered, and later became part of a wide variety of non-Windows operating systems such as Xenix, OS/2 and VMS (Pathworks). X/Open standardized it partially; Microsoft had submitted Internet-Drafts describing SMB2 to the IETF, partly in response to formal IETF standardization of version 4 of the Network File System in December 2000 as IETF RFC 3010; however, those SMB-related Internet-Drafts expired without achieving any IETF standards-track approval or any other IETF endorsement. (See http://ubiqx.org/cifs/Intro.html for historical detail.) SMB2 is also a relatively clean break with the past. Microsoft&#x27;s SMB1 code has to work with a large variety of SMB clients and servers. SMB1 features many versions of information for commands (selecting what structure to return for a particular request) because features such as Unicode support were retro-fitted at a later date. SMB2 involves significantly reduced compatibility-testing for implementers of the protocol. SMB2 code has considerably less complexity since far less variability exists (for example, non-Unicode code paths become redundant as SMB2 requires Unicode support).

Apple migrated to SMB2 (from their own Apple Filing Protocol, now legacy) starting with OS X 10.9 &quot;Mavericks&quot;. This transition was fraught with compatibility problems though. Non-default support for SMB2 appeared in fact in OS X 10.7, when Apple abandoned Samba in favor of its own SMB implementation called SMBX after Samba adopted GPLv3.

The Linux kernel&#x27;s CIFS client file system has SMB2 support since version 3.7.

=== SMB 2.1 ===
SMB 2.1, introduced with Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2, introduced minor performance enhancements with a new opportunistic locking mechanism.

=== SMB 3.0 ===
SMB 3.0 (previously named SMB 2.2) was introduced with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. It brought several significant changes that are intended to add functionality and improve SMB2 performance, notably in virtualized data centers:
* the SMB Direct Protocol (SMB over remote direct memory access [RDMA])
* SMB Multichannel (multiple connections per SMB session),
* SMB Transparent Failover

It also introduces several security enhancements, such as end-to-end encryption and a new AES based signing algorithm.

=== SMB 3.0.2 ===
SMB 3.0.2 (known as 3.02 at the time) was introduced with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2; in those and later releases, the earlier SMB version 1 can be optionally disabled to increase security.

=== SMB 3.1.1 ===
SMB 3.1.1 was introduced with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. This version supports AES-128 GCM encryption in addition to AES-128 CCM encryption added in SMB3, and implements pre-authentication integrity check using SHA-512 hash. SMB 3.1.1 also makes secure negotiation mandatory when connecting to clients using SMB versions that support it.

== Specifications ==

The specifications for the SMB are proprietary and were initially closed, thereby forcing other vendors and projects to reverse-engineer the protocol to interoperate with it. The SMB 1.0 protocol was eventually published some time after it was reverse engineered, whereas the SMB 2.0 protocol was made available from Microsoft&#x27;s Open Specifications Developer Center from the outset.

== Third-party implementations ==

=== Samba ===

In 1991, Andrew Tridgell started the development of Samba, a free-software re-implementation (using reverse engineering) of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol for Unix-like systems, initially to implement an SMB server to allow PC clients running the DEC Pathworks client to access files on SunOS machines. Because of the importance of the SMB protocol in interacting with the widespread Microsoft Windows platform, Samba became a popular free software implementation of a compatible SMB client and server to allow non-Windows operating systems, such as Unix-like operating systems, to interoperate with Windows.

As of version 3 (2003), Samba provides file and print services for Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Windows NT 4.0 server domain, either as a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or as a domain member. Samba4 installations can act as an Active Directory domain controller or member server, at Windows 2008 domain and forest functional levels.

Package managers in Linux distributions can search for the &quot;cifs-utils&quot; package. The package is from the Samba maintainers.

=== Netsmb ===
NSMB (Netsmb and SMBFS) is a family of in-kernel SMB client implementations in BSD operating systems. It was first contributed to FreeBSD 4.4 by Boris Popov, and is now found in a wide range of other BSD systems including NetBSD and macOS. The implementations have diverged significantly ever since.

The macOS version of NSMB is notable for its now-common scheme of representing symlinks. This &quot;Minshall-French&quot; format shows symlinks as textual files with a extension and a magic number, always 1067 bytes long. This format is also used for storing symlinks on native SMB servers or unsupported filesystems. Samba supports this format with an option. Docker on Windows also seems to use it.

=== NQ ===
NQ is a family of portable SMB client and server implementations developed by Visuality Systems, an Israel-based company established in 1998 by Sam Widerman, formerly the CEO of Siemens Data Communications. The NQ family comprises an embedded SMB stack (written in C), a Pure Java SMB Client, and a storage SMB Server implementation. All solutions support the latest SMB 3.1.1 dialect. NQ for Linux, NQ for WinCE, iOS, Android, VxWorks and other real-time operating systems are all supported by the configurable NQ solution.

=== MoSMB ===
MoSMB is a user space SMB implementation for Linux. It supports SMB 2.x and SMB 3.x. Key features include Cloud-scale Active-Active Scale-out Clusters, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Multichannel, Transparent Failover and Continuous Availability. MoSMB also supports Amazon S3 object storage as storage backend in addition to POSIX file systems such as ext4, ZFS, Lustre, Ceph, etc.

=== Fusion File Share by Tuxera ===
Fusion File Share by Tuxera is a proprietary SMB server implementation developed by Tuxera that can be run either in kernel or user space. It supports SMB 3.1.1 and all previous versions, additionally advanced SMB features like continuous availability (persistent handles) scale-out, RDMA (SMB Direct), SMB multichannel, transparent compression, shadow copy.

=== Likewise ===

Likewise developed a CIFS/SMB implementation (versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and SMB 3.0) in 2009 that provided a multiprotocol, identity-aware platform for network access to files used in OEM storage products built on Linux/Unix based devices. The platform could be used for traditional NAS, Cloud Gateway, and Cloud Caching devices for providing secure access to files across a network. Likewise was purchased by EMC Isilon in 2012.

=== KSMBD ===
KSMBD is an open source in-kernel CIFS/SMB server implementation for the Linux kernel. Compared to user-space implementations, it provides better performance and makes it easier to implement some features such as SMB Direct. It supports SMB 3.1.1 and previous versions.

== Security ==
Over the years, there have been many security vulnerabilities in Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of the protocol or components on which it directly relies. Other vendors&#x27; security vulnerabilities lie primarily in a lack of support for newer authentication protocols like NTLMv2 and Kerberos in favor of protocols like NTLMv1, LanMan, or plaintext passwords. Real-time attack tracking shows that SMB is one of the primary attack vectors for intrusion attempts, for example the 2014 Sony Pictures attack, and the WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017. In 2020, two SMB high-severity vulnerabilities were disclosed and dubbed as SMBGhost (CVE-2020-0796) and SMBleed (CVE-2020-1206), which when chained together can provide RCE (Remote Code Execution) privilege to the attacker.

=== SMB specifications ===
** Specifies the Common Internet File System (CIFS) Protocol, a cross-platform, transport-independent protocol that provides a mechanism for client systems to use file and print services made available by server systems over a network
** Specifies the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol, which defines extensions to the existing Common Internet File System (CIFS) specification that have been implemented by Microsoft since the publication of the CIFS specification.
** Specifies the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Versions 2 and 3, which support the sharing of file and print resources between machines and extend the concepts from the Server Message Block Protocol.
** Specifies the SMB2 Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) Transport Protocol, a wrapper for the existing SMB2 protocol that allows SMB2 packets to be delivered over RDMA-capable transports such as iWARP or Infiniband while utilizing the direct data placement (DDP) capabilities of these transports. Benefits include reduced CPU overhead, lower latency, and improved throughput.

<text>The Inn of the Sixth Happiness is a 1958 20th Century Fox film loosely based on the story of Gladys Aylward, a British woman who became a missionary in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Directed by Mark Robson, who received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director, the film stars Ingrid Bergman as Aylward and Curt Jürgens as her love interest, Captain Lin Nan, a Chinese Army officer with a Dutch father. Robert Donat, who played the mandarin of the town in which Aylward lived, died before the film was released. The musical score was composed and conducted by Malcolm Arnold. The cinematography was by Freddie Young.

The film was shot in Snowdonia, North Wales. Most of the children in the film were ethnic Chinese children from Liverpool, home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe.

== Plot ==
The story begins with Aylward (Ingrid Bergman) being rejected as a potential missionary to China because of her lack of education. Dr. Robinson (Moultrie Kelsall), the senior missionary, feels sorry for her and secures her a position in the home of Sir Francis Jamison (Ronald Squire), a veteran explorer with contacts in China. Over the next few months, Aylward saves her money to purchase a ticket on the Trans-Siberian Railway, choosing the more dangerous overland route to the East because it is less expensive. Sir Francis writes to his only surviving friend in China, veteran missionary, Jeannie Lawson (Athene Seyler), who agrees to accept Gladys as a much-needed assistant at her mission in the remote county of Yangcheng. Lawson has set up an inn for muleteers, where the men can get clean food for their animals, communal beds without bugs, a good hot meal and Lawson&#x27;s free stories (from the Bible). The film follows Aylward&#x27;s acculturation, until tragedy strikes and Lawson dies when a balcony collapses. Captain Lin (Curt Jürgens), the commander of Yancheng&#x27;s garrison, advises Aylward to go home and wishes her well as he leaves.

Aylward takes over running the inn, with the help of Yang (Peter Chong), the devoted cook, who tells the stories himself while teaching Aylward Chinese. The local Mandarin (Robert Donat) appoints Aylward as his Foot Inspector, charging her with enforcing the government&#x27;s command that the ancient practice of foot binding be eradicated. She succeeds in this assignment, winning the esteem of the people and of the Mandarin as she travels regularly through the mountains, earning the nickname &quot;She who loves&quot; and becoming a Chinese citizen. When Lin, now a Colonel, returns to prepare the region for war with Japan, she has just stopped a prison riot. Lin goes with her on her rounds. Before he leaves, they confess their love.

In 1937, Japan invades China. An air raid shatters the city, killing Yang. The Mandarin evacuates the population to the countryside, and Li (Bert Kwouk), a former prisoner, comes to help Aylward with her five adopted children.

Later, Lin returns with the news that the war is going badly and the Mandarin must go to a safe haven. Lin wants her to go too, but she says &quot;These are my people and I will live and die for them.&quot; They kiss. At a last meeting with his council, the Mandarin announces that he is converting to Christianity to honour Aylward and the faith that underlies her work. He says farewell: They will not meet again.

In the now-virtually deserted city, Aylward has gathered 50 children at the Inn, struggling to find food, facing a bitter winter, and not knowing where to go. Another 50 children arrive from another mission with a letter from the missionary telling her that trucks will evacuate them to a new home in the interior, but they must get to the mission at Xi&#x27;an by 12 November, in three weeks, or the trucks will leave without them. The trip should take a week by road, but Lin and his men intercept them and warn her that the Japanese control the road ahead. They must go over the mountains. She believes this is why God wanted her to come to China. Lin gives her a map. Saying, &quot;I know you&#x27;ll come back if you can,&quot; he puts a ring on her hand.

After a long, difficult journey, including a perilous river crossing, they all arrive safely (except for Li, who dies to save them from a Japanese patrol) on the day the trucks are to leave. The film culminates with the column of children, led by Aylward, marching through cheering crowds and up to the steps of the mission, singing the song &quot;This Old Man”, which Aylward taught the children to warm themselves after the river crossing. Aylward is greeted by Dr. Robinson. She asks if he remembers her: “My name used to be Gladys Aylward.” He nods gravely and replies, “Yes, I remember. Gladys Aylward, who wasn&#x27;t qualified to come to China.” He invites her to come to the children&#x27;s village in the interior, but she declines: “I am going home,” she says, looking back toward the mountains.

==Production==

The film was shot in CinemaScope using the DeLuxe Color process.

For the production of &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot;, 20th Century Fox rented space at MGM British Studios Borehamwood, where the Chinese villages were built on the backlot, with location scenes filmed in Nantmor, near Beddgelert in North Wales.

A gold-painted statue of Buddha that was used on a set for the film is now located in the Italianate village of Portmeirion, North Wales. Sean Connery was considered for the role of Captain Lin. His screen test can be seen on the DVD.

Since the film&#x27;s release, the filmmakers have been criticised for casting Ingrid Bergman, a tall woman with a Swedish accent, as Gladys Aylward, who was in fact short and had a cockney accent. Likewise, the two male leads, British actor Robert Donat and Austrian actor Curt Jurgens were not even Chinese (though Jurgens&#x27; character is said to be half-Dutch). Singer Bill Elliott sang the hit song &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; with the Cyril Stapleton Orchestra.

== Historical accuracy ==

The film was based on the biography &quot;The Small Woman&quot; (1957), by Alan Burgess.

Gladys Aylward (19021970) was deeply upset by the inaccuracy of the film. Although she found herself a figure of international interest thanks to the popularity of the film and television and media interviews, Aylward was mortified by her depiction in the film and the many liberties it took. The tall, Swedish Ingrid Bergman was inconsistent with Aylward&#x27;s small stature, dark hair and Cockney accent. The struggles of Aylward and her family to effect her initial trip to China were skipped over in favour of the plot device of her employer &quot;condescending to write to &#x27;his old friend&#x27; Jeannie Lawson&quot;, and Aylward&#x27;s dangerous, complicated travels across Russia and China were reduced to &quot;a few rude soldiers&quot;, after which &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s train delivered her neatly to Tsientsin.&quot;

Many characters and places were renamed in the film, including Aylward&#x27;s adopted children and the inn itself, which was actually called &quot;the Inn of the Eight Happinesses&quot; (in reference to the Chinese belief that the number eight is auspicious). Aylward is given the Chinese name &quot;Jiān Ài&quot; in the film, but she was actually known as &quot;Ài Wěi Dé&quot; (a Chinese approximation of &quot;Aylward&quot; with the meaning &quot;virtuous one&quot;).

It is true that in 1938 Aylward led almost 100 children 100 miles to safety from Japanese invaders. But real life was very different from the film. At the end of the journey, &quot;the brown-eyed, modest missionary was virtually unconscious and delirious with typhus and fever.&quot;

Captain Lin Nan was portrayed as half-European, a change which Aylward found insulting to his Chinese lineage. She also resented the Hollywood-embellished love scenes in the film; not only had she never kissed any man, but the film&#x27;s ending portrayed her character abandoning the orphans in order to join the captain elsewhere, even though in reality she worked with orphans for the rest of her life. In 1958, the year of the film&#x27;s release, she founded a children&#x27;s home in Taiwan, which she continued to run until her death in 1970. She continues to be regarded as a national hero.

==Reception==
The film was the second most popular film at the British box office in 1959 behind &quot;Carry on Nurse,&quot; with a gross of $700,000.

<doc id="349889" wikidata="Q257855" url="?curid=349889" title="Anti-Federalism">
<text>Anti-Federalism was a late-18th-century political movement that opposed the creation of a stronger U.S. federal government and which later opposed the ratification of the 1787 Constitution. The previous constitution, called the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, gave state governments more authority. Led by Patrick Henry of Virginia, Anti-Federalists worried, among other things, that the position of president, then a novelty, might evolve into a monarchy. Though the Constitution was ratified and supplanted the Articles of Confederation, Anti-Federalist influence helped lead to the passage of the Bill of Rights.

== Nomenclature ==
The name &quot;Anti-Federalists&quot; is a misnomer. It was imposed upon the movement by their opponents, the Federalists, and was supposed to mark them as men who &quot;stood against the very political ideas they embraced&quot;. According to historian Carol Berkin:
== Main beliefs ==

The Anti-Federalists were against the ratification of the Constitution for many reasons. The Anti-Federalists believed that the Constitution, as drafted, would lead to a loss of individual liberties, an erosion of state sovereignty, and the potential for the rise of tyranny. They advocated for a more decentralized form of government with greater protections for individual rights and stronger representation for the states. Principally, they were afraid that the national government would be too robust and would, thus, threaten states and individual rights. In the broad Antifederalist sense, they held that states should be significantly autonomous and independent in their authority, applying the right to self-administration in all significant internal matters without the unwanted interjections of the federal government. The Anti-Federalists debated with their Federalist colleagues, including Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, on the functional model and competencies of the planned federal government. The Anti-Federalists believed that almost all the executive power should be left to the country&#x27;s authorities, while the Federalists wanted centralized national governments.

They also believed that a large central government would not serve the interests of small towns and rural areas, as opposed to the urban interests that most Federalist delegates aligned with. Generally, Anti-federalists were more likely to be small farmers than lawyers and merchants and came from rural areas rather than the urban areas many federalists represented. In their journey to protect the interests of rural areas and farmers, the Anti-Federalists believed:
* They believed the Constitution, as written, would be oppressive
* They believed the Constitution needed a Bill of Rights.
* They believed the Constitution created a presidency so powerful that it would become a monarchy.
* They believed the Constitution provided insufficient rights in the courts (e.g., no guarantee of juries in civil cases, nor that criminal case juries be local) and would create an out-of-control judiciary.
* They believed that the national government would be too far away from the people and thus unresponsive to the needs of localities.
* They believed the Constitution would abrogate, at least in part, the power of the states.
* They believed the federal government&#x27;s powers to tax provided by the Constitution could be used to exploit citizens and weaken the power of the states.

The arguments of the Anti-Federalists influenced the formation of the Bill of Rights. As a response to the Anti-Federalists’s demands of a bill of rights to guarantee specific liberties, the Federalists agreed to consider amendments to be added to the new Constitution. This helped assuage its critics and ensure that the Constitution would be successfully ratified. James Madison, a Federalist at the time and the primary architect of the Constitution, introduced draft proposals of what would become the first ten amendments of the United States Constitution and advocated for their passage. In particular, the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution reinforced the reservation of the powers to the states or the people.

== History ==
During the American Revolution and its immediate aftermath, the term &quot;federal&quot; was applied to any person who supported the colonial union and the government formed under the Articles of Confederation. After the war, the group that felt the national government under the Articles was too weak appropriated the name Federalist for themselves. Historian Jackson Turner Main wrote, &quot;to them, the man of &#x27;federal principles&#x27; approved of &#x27;federal measures,&#x27; which meant those that increased the weight and authority or extended the influence of the Confederation Congress.&quot;

As the Federalists moved to amend the Articles, eventually leading to the Constitutional Convention, they applied the term anti-federalist to their opposition. The term implied, correctly or not, both opposition to Congress and unpatriotic motives. The Anti-Federalists rejected the term, arguing that they were the true Federalists. In both their correspondence and their local groups, they tried to capture the term. For example, an unknown anti-federalist signed his public correspondence as &quot;A Federal Farmer&quot; and the New York committee opposing the Constitution was called the &quot;Federal Republican Committee.&quot; However, the Federalists carried the day and the name Anti-Federalist forever stuck. 
The Anti-Federalists were composed of diverse elements, including those opposed to the Constitution because they thought that a stronger government threatened the sovereignty and prestige of the states, localities, or individuals; those that saw in the proposed government a new centralized, disguised &quot;monarchic&quot; power that would only replace the cast-off despotism of Great Britain; and those who simply feared that the new government threatened their personal liberties. Some of the opposition believed that the central government under the Articles of Confederation was sufficient. Still others believed that while the national government under the Articles was too weak, the national government under the Constitution would be too strong. Another complaint of the Anti-Federalists was that the Constitution provided for a centralized rather than federal government (and in &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, James Madison admitted that the new Constitution had the characteristics of both a centralized and federal form of government) and that a truly federal form of government was a leaguing of states as under the Articles of Confederation.

During the period of debate over the ratification of the Constitution, numerous independent local speeches and articles were published all across the country. Initially, many of the articles in opposition were written under pseudonyms, such as &quot;Brutus&quot; (likely Melancton Smith), &quot;Centinel&quot; (likely Samuel Bryan), and &quot;Federal Farmer.&quot; Eventually, famous revolutionary figures such as Patrick Henry came out publicly against the Constitution. They argued that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to the rights of individuals and that the president would become a king. They objected to the federal court system created by the proposed constitution. Minority groups also contributed, such as Mercy Otis Warren who disguised herself as &quot;A Colombian Patriot,&quot; thought to be Elbridge Gerry. Warren&#x27;s most notable pamphlet discussed the treatment of minorities and American natural rights; this pamphlet was titled &quot;History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution&quot;. This produced a body of political writing; the best and most influential of these articles and speeches were gathered by historians into a collection known as the &quot;Anti-Federalist Papers&quot; in allusion to the &quot;Federalist Papers&quot;. The authors of these works did not organize together as a group. Instead, they used the medium of print to spread their ideas individually.

In many states the opposition to the Constitution was strong (although Delaware, Georgia, and New Jersey ratified quickly with little controversy), and in two states—North Carolina and Rhode Island—it prevented ratification until the definite establishment of the new government practically forced their adherence. Individualism was the strongest element of opposition; the necessity, or at least the desirability, of a bill of rights was almost universally felt. In Rhode Island, resistance against the Constitution was so strong that civil war almost broke out on July 4, 1788, when anti-federalist members of the Country Party led by Judge William West marched into Providence with over 1,000 armed protesters.

The Anti-Federalists played upon these feelings in the ratification convention in Massachusetts. By this point, five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease, but the Massachusetts convention was far more disputed and contentious. After a long debate, a compromise (known as the &quot;Massachusetts compromise&quot;) was reached. Massachusetts would ratify the Constitution with recommended provisions in the ratifying instrument that the Constitution be amended with a bill of rights. (The Federalists contended that a conditional ratification would be void, so the recommendation was the strongest support that the ratifying convention could give to a bill of rights short of rejecting the Constitution.)

Four of the next five states to ratify, including New Hampshire, Virginia, and New York, included similar language in their ratification instruments. As a result, shortly after the Constitution became operative in 1789, Congress sent a set of twelve amendments to the states. Ten of these amendments were immediately ratified and became known as the Bill of Rights, with one of the other two becoming the 27th Amendment—almost 200 years later. Thus, while the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in their quest to prevent the adoption of the Constitution, their efforts were not totally in vain. The Anti-Federalists thus became recognized as an influential group among the Founding Fathers of the United States.

With the passage of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the Anti-Federalist movement was exhausted. Some activists joined the Anti-Administration party that James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were forming about 1790–91 to oppose the policies of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton&#x27;s Pro-Administration faction became the Federalist Party, while the group opposing Hamilton soon became the Democratic-Republican Party. When Jefferson took office as the third president in 1801, he replaced Federalist appointees with Democratic-Republicans and sought to focus on issues that allowed the states to make more of their own decisions in matters. He also repealed the whiskey excise and other federal taxes, shut down some federal offices and broadly sought to change the fiscal system that Hamilton had created.

<text>Count Zero is a science fiction novel by American-Canadian writer William Gibson, originally published in 1986. It presents a near future whose technologies include a network of supercomputers that created a &quot;matrix&quot; in &quot;cyberspace&quot;, an accessible, virtual, three-dimensionally active &quot;inner space&quot;, which, for Gibson—writing these decades earlier—was seen as being dominated by violent competition between small numbers of very rich individuals and multinational corporations. The novel is composed of a trio of plot lines that ultimately converge.

&quot;Count Zero&quot; is the second volume of the Sprawl trilogy, which began with &quot;Neuromancer&quot; and concludes with &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;. It was serialized in the January through March 1986 monthly issues of &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;; the January cover was devoted to the story, with art by Hisaki Yasuda. According to Gibson, the magazine version was edited with his permission to allow access to youth audiences in the United States.

While Gibson did not not introduce the concept or coin the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot;, a subgenre of science fiction (nor to particularly associate himself with it), he &quot;is&quot; considered to have first envisioned and described the concept of &quot;cyberspace&quot;. The novel, &quot;Count Zero&quot;, is nonetheless regarded as an early example of the cyberpunk subgenre.

===Introduction===
In &quot;Count Zero&quot; Gibson presents &quot;a high-tech near-future of linked super-computers... [a matrix that] has given rise to &quot;cyberspace,&quot; an &quot;inner&quot; space something like a three-dimensional video display... [in a] world is dominated by multinational corporations... a few fabulously rich individuals, and the cutthroat competition between them.&quot; Seven years after the events of &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, strange things begin to happen in the Matrix, leading to the proliferation of what appear to be voodoo gods (hinted to be the fractured remains of the joined AIs that were Neuromancer and Wintermute). Two powerful multinational corporations, Maas Biolabs and Hosaka, are engaged in a battle for control over a powerful new technology, a biochip, using hackers and the Matrix as well as espionage and violence.

===Expansive plot summary===
As with later Gibson works,{{cn|date = August 2024}} &quot;Count Zero&quot; has multiple story-lines; in it, a trio of plot lines ultimately converge:

Thread One: In the southwestern US, Turner, a corporate mercenary soldier, has been hired by former partner Conroy to help Christopher Mitchell, a brilliant researcher and bio-hacker, make an illegal career move from Maas&#x27; corporate fortress built into a mesa in the Arizona desert to Hosaka, a rival corporation. The attempt is a disaster, and Turner ends up escaping with Angie Mitchell, the scientist&#x27;s young daughter, instead. Implanted in her brain by her father, she carries the secret plans of the construction of the valuable &quot;biosoft&quot; that has made Maas so influential and powerful. This &quot;biosoft&quot; is what multibillionaire Josef Virek (see thread three) ruthlessly pursues so that he can make an evolutionary jump to something resembling omniscience and immortality. During their flight from both Maas and Hosaka agents, Turner and Angie stay with Rudy, the former&#x27;s estranged brother, and Sally, his partner and caretaker. Rudy identifies a device implanted in Angie&#x27;s skull: her father had apparently altered her nervous system to allow her to access the Cyberspace Matrix directly, without a &quot;deck&quot; (a computer with an interface directly into the user&#x27;s brain), but she is not aware of this. During their stay, Turner has a one-night stand with Sally and then leaves with Angie. In the Sprawl he meets with Bobby&#x27;s group in a shopping mall besieged by agents of Maas and Conroy.

Thread Two: In Barrytown, New Jersey a young amateur computer hacker, Bobby Newmark, self-named &quot;Count Zero&quot;, is given a piece of black market software by some criminal associates &quot;to test&quot;. When he plugs himself into the matrix and runs the program, it almost kills him. The only thing that saves his life is a sudden image of a girl made of light who interferes and unhooks him from the software just before he flatlines. After fleeing his house (which is immediately thereafter destroyed) he meets Lucas, Beauvoir, and Jackie, a group fascinated by and dedicated to the recent appearance of voodoo deities in Cyberspace, who take him into their protection as they are collectively targeted by various corporate agents. It is eventually revealed that Bobby&#x27;s mysterious savior is Angie (see Thread One); the two only meet physically at the very end of the book.

Thread Three: Marly Krushkova, the former owner of a Paris art gallery whose reputation was destroyed when she was tricked into trying to sell a forgery, is recruited by ultra-rich, reclusive art patron Josef Virek to find the unknown creator of a series of futuristic collage boxes styled after the work of Joseph Cornell. Unbeknownst to her, the reason behind Virek&#x27;s interest in these boxes is related to indications of biosoft construction in the design of one, which he suspects may be contained in the others.

These plotlines come together at the end of the story. Virek—the hunter of immortality and unlimited power—becomes the hunted. It is hinted that multiple AIs inhabiting cyberspace are the fragmented, compartmentalized remains of two AIs, Neuromancer and Wintermute (introduced in the first book of Gibson&#x27;s Sprawl series, &quot;Neuromancer&quot;), having joined. The AIs were designed by the head of a multi-generational techno-oligarchical family, the Tessier-Ashpools. These AI units now interface with humanity in the form of different Haitian voodoo gods, as they have found these constructs to be the best representations of themselves for communicating. Hackers worldwide are becoming aware that there is something weird loose in the cyberspace matrix, but most are reluctant to talk about (or deal with) &quot;voodoo spooks&quot; supposedly haunting cyberspace. The &quot;voodoo gods&quot; gave Mitchell the information to develop the biosoft, instructing him to insert a biosoft modification in his daughter&#x27;s brain, and then sent the Cornell boxes into the world to attract and enable the disposal of the malicious Virek.

A pair of epilogue chapters resolve the fates of the protagonists, until &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;. Angie has attained celebrity status as a simstim star, and has entered a relationship with Bobby who is employed as her &#x27;bodyguard&#x27;. Marly has returned to Paris and now curates one of the largest art galleries in the city. Turner has returned to his childhood home (the same one occupied by Rudy and Sally earlier in the book) to raise the child conceived during his affair with Sally; Rudy was killed by Conroy&#x27;s agents when they were trailing Turner and Angie.

The Cyberspace Matrix, a synergistically linked computer network of databases that encompasses all information on Earth, has become home to sentient beings. But most of humanity remains unaware.

Bobby Newmark. At the beginning of the novel, Bobby is a small-time &quot;cowboy&quot; (hacker) who wants to be a big name in cyberspace. He is given what he naïvely trusts is an &quot;ICE breaker&quot; (hacking software), unaware that he is in fact being used to test some unknown software to see what it does. He is directed to use the software to infiltrate a black ICE database which nearly ends up killing him. The acronym ICE is shorthand for &quot;Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics&quot;. The most formidable of these data defense networks are powerful enough to trace back and kill any hacker making an attempt to defeat them. This is legally sanctioned or is, at least, not illegal. But at the last moment Bobby is rescued, while in Cyberspace and dying, by an image of a girl, Angela Mitchell, who is somehow able to enter cyberspace without using a &quot;deck&quot; (computer).

Bobby realizes his target must now know where he lives, so he flees. Shortly after leaving his apartment, he is brutally mugged for his deck and left for dead, only to be rescued and given medical attention by the owners of the software Bobby tried out, a small group who are very interested in what happened to him in Cyberspace. Bobby and Angela (who are roughly the same age) meet at the end of the book. Bobby makes a minor appearance in the third Sprawl novel, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;.

Turner. Turner (the only name by which he is known in the novel) is a mercenary who is employed by various corporations to help vital employees of competing corporations &quot;defect&quot; to Turner&#x27;s employers. The novel begins with an account of a job in New Delhi in which Turner was nearly killed by a Slamhound, a type of mobile bomb. After three months of reconstructive surgery in Singapore, Turner takes a vacation in Mexico, where he meets and becomes sexually involved with a woman named Allison. While on the beach with Allison, Turner sees a familiar yacht close to shore and a powerboat from the yacht approaching the beach, bearing the logo of the Hosaka Corporation. Turner tells Allison to leave while he waits for the raft&#x27;s passenger to come ashore. He already knows that the passenger is Conroy, another mercenary with whom Turner has worked in the past. Conroy recruits Turner for another &quot;extraction&quot; job; this time, Conroy and Turner are to help a man named Christopher Mitchell leave Maas Biolabs for Hosaka. Mitchell carries with him the expertise to design and manufacture &quot;biochips&quot;, a technology superior to the nearly ubiquitous silicon microprocessors of the era. Maas Biolabs holds the patents and secrets to biochip technology and will use every means it can to prevent Mitchell&#x27;s escape. Conroy also reveals that Allison is a &quot;field psychologist&quot; working for Hosaka to monitor Turner and help his recovery.

Turner is a disciplined professional, but is troubled by memories of past jobs that ended tragically as well as his relationship with his gifted brother Rudy (who is a reclusive alcoholic and drug addict). Turner comes to realize that the unsuccessful attempt to &quot;bring over&quot; Christopher Mitchell from Maas to Hosaka resulted from a betrayal and suspects that Conroy is behind it. He also recognizes that Angie Mitchell was sent out from the Maas facility by her father, and that she is in grave danger. He resolves to protect her while finding out who is pursuing her and why.

Marly Krushkhova. Marly, prior to the beginning of the story, operated a small art gallery in Paris. She became notorious as a result of the disgrace from attempting to sell a forged box assemblage that was supposedly a lost piece by the American sculptor Joseph Cornell. She was unaware that the piece was a fake, having been duped by her then-lover Alain, the gallery&#x27;s co-owner, who had embezzled money from the gallery to finance the forgery. Unemployed and living with her friend Andrea, Marly receives a job offer from the immensely wealthy businessman Josef Virek. During her interview, conducted via a very advanced simstim link, Virek informs Marly that he has collected several remarkable box assemblages similar to those created by Cornell. Virek then hires Marly to find out who is producing the pieces, offering her unlimited financial support during the course of her search.

Although Marly welcomes the opportunity to get out of her current situation, she does not fully trust the mysterious and secretive Virek. This mistrust only deepens when it becomes clear that she is being followed and monitored by Virek&#x27;s agents, in particular Virek&#x27;s right-hand man, Paco. Marly tries to stay a step ahead of Virek and Paco while discovering the identity of the boxes&#x27; creator.

{{expand section | with = further source-derived content on the contemporaneous and more recent review and analysis of this work, in the context of the trilogy | small = no | date = August 2024}}

In this and his earlier Neuromancer work, Gibson—while not creating, naming, or (per Jack Womack) much wishing to be associated with the term—nevertheless became associated with the cyberpunk moniker subgenre of science fiction; more importantly, he is considered to have first envisioned and described the concept of &quot;cyberspace&quot;. The &quot;Count Zero&quot; novel is regarded by some,{{who|date = August 2024}} as an early example of the cyberpunk subgenre.{{cn|date = August 2024}}

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Count Zero&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #76, and stated that &quot;This may not have the impact of &quot;Neuromancer&quot;{{&#x27;}}s first window on Gibson&#x27;s future, but it&#x27;s a far better novel.&quot; &quot;Count Zero&quot; was nominated for the Nebula and British Science Fiction Awards in 1986, as well as the Hugo and Locus awards in 1987.

<doc id="349909" wikidata="Q663215" url="?curid=349909" title="Mona Lisa Overdrive">
<text>Mona Lisa Overdrive is a science fiction novel by American-Canadian writer William Gibson, published in 1988. It is the final novel of the cyberpunk Sprawl trilogy, following &quot;Neuromancer&quot; and &quot;Count Zero&quot;, taking place eight years after the events of the latter. The novel was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel, the Hugo Award for Best Novel, and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1989.

== Plot==
Taking place eight years after the events of &quot;Count Zero&quot; and fifteen years after &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, the story is formed from several interconnecting plot threads, and also features characters from Gibson&#x27;s previous works (such as Molly Millions, the razor-fingered mercenary from &quot;Neuromancer&quot;).

Thread one: concerns Mona, a teen prostitute who has a more-than-passing resemblance to famed Simstim superstar Angie Mitchell. Mona is hired by shady individuals for a &quot;gig&quot; which later turns out to be part of a plot to abduct Angie.

Thread two: focuses on a young Japanese girl named Kumiko, daughter of a yakuza boss sent to London to keep her safe while her father engages in a gang war with other top yakuza leaders. In London, she is cared for by one of her father&#x27;s retainers, who is also a powerful member of the London Mob. She meets Molly Millions (having altered her appearance and now calling herself &quot;Sally Shears&quot;, in order to conceal her identity from hostile parties who are implied to be pursuing her), who takes the girl under her wing.

Thread three: follows a reclusive artist named Slick Henry, who lives in a place named Factory in the Dog Solitude; a large, poisoned expanse of deserted factories and dumps, probably in southern New Jersey. Slick Henry is a convicted car thief whose punishment consisted of having his short-term memory erased every five minutes, leading to continuous confusion and dissociation. Following the end of his sentence, he spends his days creating large robotic sculptures and periodically suffers episodes of time loss, returning to consciousness afterward with no memory of what he did during the blackout. He is hired by an acquaintance to look after the comatose &quot;Count&quot; (Bobby Newmark from the second novel, &quot;Count Zero&quot;, who has hooked himself into a super-capacity cyber-bio harddrive called an Aleph).
A theoretical &quot;Aleph&quot; would have the RAM capacity to literally contain all of reality, enough that a memory construct of a person would contain the complete personality of the individual and allow it to learn, grow and act independently.

The final plotline follows Angela Mitchell, famous simstim star, and the girl from the second Sprawl novel &quot;Count Zero&quot;. Angie, thanks to brain manipulations by her father when she was a child, has always had the ability to access cyberspace directly (without a cyberspace deck), but drugs provided by her production company Sense/Net have severely impeded this ability.

The plot culminates when Angie and Bobby &quot;upload&quot; their consciousness into the Aleph, on the verge of visiting an alien artificial intelligence apparently found on a planet orbiting Centauri. Mona takes Angie&#x27;s place as a simstim star following forced cosmetic surgery to make Mona look identical to Angie.

== Influences ==
The story of the reclusive artist who makes cybernetic sculptures is a reference to Mark Pauline of Survival Research Labs.

The name of the dense lump of cybernetic hardware that Bobby Newmark&#x27;s consciousness is jacked into is a direct reference to the short story &quot;The Aleph&quot; by Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges. The titular Aleph is a point in space which contains all other points, and if one were to gaze into the Aleph one would be able to see or experience the entirety of existence.

==Reception==
Thomas M. Disch reviewed the novel for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, giving it a mixed review: &quot;Only in retrospect, however, is &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; a disappointment. Zing by zing, its 45 chapters provide a sufficiency of non-nutritive fun.&quot; It received positive reviews in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;.

== Legacy ==
A track of the score for the film &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; by Juno Reactor and Don Davis was named &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;. &quot;The Matrix&quot; trilogy was heavily influenced by Gibson&#x27;s writing. A different version of the song is on Juno Reactor&#x27;s album &quot;Labyrinth&quot;.

A track in the album &quot;Mista Thug Isolation&quot; by Lil Ugly Mane is titled &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;.

Japanese rock band Buck-Tick&#x27;s album of the same name was mistakenly named as such, since Hisashi Imai confused it with Robert Longo&#x27;s 1986 wall sculpture &quot;Samurai Overdrive&quot; when naming the album.

<text>James Puckle (1667–1724) was an English inventor, lawyer and writer from London chiefly remembered for his invention of the &quot;Defence Gun&quot;, better known as the &quot;Puckle gun&quot;, a multi-shot gun mounted on a stand capable of (depending on which version) firing up to nine rounds per minute. The Puckle gun is one of the first weapons referred to as a machine gun (though its operation does not match the modern definition of the term) and resembles a large revolver.

Puckle&#x27;s best-known literary work (reprinted as recently as 1900) was &quot;The Club&quot;, a moral dialogue between a father and son.

In 1718, Puckle patented his new invention, the &quot;Defence Gun&quot; — a tripod-mounted, single-barreled flintlock weapon fitted with a multishot revolving cylinder, designed for shipboard use to prevent boarding. The barrel was long with a bore of and a pre-loaded cylinder which held 6-11 charges and could fire 63 shots in seven minutes—this at a time when the standard soldier&#x27;s musket could at best be loaded and fired five times per minute.

Puckle demonstrated two versions of the basic design: one, intended for use against Christian enemies, fired conventional round bullets, while the second variant, designed to be used against the Muslim Turks, fired square bullets which were considered to be more damaging and would, according to its patent, convince the Turks of the &quot;benefits of Christian civilization.&quot;

The Puckle Gun drew few investors and never achieved mass production or sales to the British armed forces. One leaflet of the period sarcastically observed, following the business venture&#x27;s failure, that the gun has &quot;only wounded those who hold shares therein.&quot;

According to the Patent Office of the United Kingdom, &quot;In the reign of Queen Anne, the law officers of the Crown established as a condition of patent that the inventor must in writing describe the invention and the manner in which it works.&quot; James Puckle&#x27;s 1718 patent, number 418, was one of the first to provide such a description.

John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, Master-General of the Ordnance (1740-9), purchased at least two for an ill-fated expedition in 1722 to capture St Lucia and St Vincent. One remains on display at Boughton House and another at Beaulieu Palace House (both former Montagu homes).

There is a replica of a Puckle Gun at Bucklers Hard Maritime Museum in Hampshire.

Blackmore&#x27;s &quot;British Military Firearms 1650–1850&quot; lists &quot;Puckle’s brass gun in the Tower of London&quot; as illustration 77: This appears to have been one of the Montagu guns on loan to the Tower at the time.

<text>Datchet is a village and civil parish in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England, on the north bank of the River Thames. Historically part of Buckinghamshire, and the Stoke Hundred, the village was eventually transferred to Berkshire, under the Local Government Act of 1972. The village developed because of its proximity to Windsor and the ferry service which connected it to the main London Road across the River Thames. The ferry was later replaced by a road bridge at the foot of High Street. The bridge was rebuilt three times. There is also a rail bridge approaching Windsor across the river, and road bridges above and below the village. 

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Datchet&quot; is first attested, in a charter from between 990 and 992, as &quot;Deccet&quot;; it appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Daceta&quot;. The name is thought to be Celtic in origin, partly because of its similarity to the ancient Gaulish name &quot;Decetia&quot;; the last part may be the Brittonic word that appears in modern Welsh as &quot;coed&quot; (&quot;wood&quot;).

==History==
There is evidence of habitation in the area shortly after the end of the last ice age, between 10,000 and 6,500 years ago, and of a multi-period settlement at Southlea from the Neolithic to the late Roman periods. An excavation at Riding Court, a manorial sub-division of Datchet, has revealed a monument complex that included a cursus, ring ditches, oval barrows and causewayed enclosures. The monuments had developed alongside the River Thames, which acted as a barrier, a gateway and a routeway to other regions. The 2017 investigations at Riding Court Farm have provided evidence of Early Neolithic activity (4000–3350 BC) with the discovery of a previously unknown causewayed enclosure.

Datchet is first mentioned between 990 and 994, when Æthelred made small grants of land here. In the Domesday Book, in 1066 the lords were the brothers Saewulf and Siward. In 1086 the lord and tenant-in-chief was Giles, brother of Ansculf, also referred to as Giles de Pinkney. In 1150, the church already existed in Datchet, and the Pinkney family sold it to the abbey of St Albans. The Abbot became rector as impropriator of the parish and had the right to appoint vicars. There was a ferry at Datchet Ferry which provided a shorter route from London to Windsor Castle and was frequently used by royalty.

In 1249, Henry III gave a great oak from Windsor Forest to make a barge for passage from Windsor to Datchet. In 1350, Edward III gave Datchet Church as part of the endowment of his new church and college of St George at Windsor Castle. St. Mary&#x27;s church originated as a rectory in the 13th century. A church, dated from 1559 by the parish registers, was dismantled in 1857, rebuilt, and reopened in 1860. It is notable in that its tower is octagonal, the greater number of church towers being square or round. On the dissolution of the monasteries, the Crown confiscated the rectory, which was sold by Parliament in 1659 to William Stanbridge and Thomas Roberts.

The history of the manor begins in 1335 when Edward III gave the manor of Datchet to William de Montacute, who then passed it on to Sir John Molyns, who held it until 1631, when it passed to the Winwood family and eventually to the Buccleuch and Montagu families. Lord Montagu of Beaulieu is still the titular Lord of Datchet Manor but owns no property here. 

In 1641, Charles I sold the manor house and estate of Riding Court to William Wheeler. It was later sold out of the Wheeler estates, and, after passing through various hands, was finally conveyed to John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu in 1742, and so came once more under the same ownership as Datchet Manor. After the death in 1790 of his son-in-law, George, Earl of Cardigan, created Duke of Montagu in 1766, the manors passed to the latter&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth wife of Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. From 1802 the title followed the same descent as Datchet and Ditton in Stoke Poges, and the manorial rights were vested in John Walter Edward, the second Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, until recently transferred to David Mapley, the current owner.

In 1706, the ferry that carried traffic across the River Thames through Datchet was replaced by Datchet Bridge. The crossing was replaced three times until it was finally demolished in 1851 as part of the re-routing of roads and bridges when the LSWR railway line was built from Richmond to Windsor. Traffic between Old Windsor and Datchet now uses a southerly route along Southlea Road and crossing Albert Bridge, while a new Windsor Road was built from Datchet riverside and crossing the new Victoria Bridge. In 1742, John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu bought Datchet manor, and his family owned it until at least 1925; at one point it was owned by the head of the influential Montagu-Douglas-Scott family, Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch.

In 1790, a workhouse was built in Holmlea Road and in 1820 an almshouse belonging to the workhouse was turned into a shop. In 1848, the first train went through Datchet to Windsor and by 1860 Datchet Common&#x27;s beer house, The Plough, was in existence. In 1886, Datchet was described as having been known as Black Datchet in the early 1800s because of a large number of bad characters living there, and that Aylesbury County Jail had one building known as the &#x27;Datchet Wing&#x27; filled mostly with poachers, for which there is good evidence.

In early 1911 a young Sydney Camm watched Sir Thomas Sopwith land his aircraft on Datchet golf course, on his return journey from Windsor Castle.

==In popular culture==
In Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;, the narrator describes a previous visit to Datchet, during which he and his friends experience extreme difficulties in getting lodgings for the night. This has descriptions of the Manor Hotel and the Royal Stag.

== Commerce and services ==
Datchet railway station is on the Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside to London Waterloo line with a journey time of around 55 minutes. The Manor is a hotel and conference centre, originally part of the Manor House range of houses, owned but never occupied by any lord of the manor. There is one pub in Datchet, The Royal Stag. The former Morning Star is now a Costa Coffee shop and the Plough is a branch of Tesco. Datchet has three schools; Churchmead School, a secondary school, Datchet St. Mary&#x27;s Primary School, and Eton End, a private preparatory school.

==Sport and social clubs==
Datchet has a number of sports clubs, including Datchet Cricket Club, Datchet Football Club (Senior &amp; Junior Football), a golf club founded in 1892, and a sailing club at the Queen Mother Reservoir. Datchet Players are an amateur dramatics society that have been putting on productions in the village hall since the 1960s.

<doc id="349941" wikidata="Q649165" url="?curid=349941" title="Being John Malkovich">
<text>Being John Malkovich is a 1999 American surrealist fantasy comedy drama film directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman, both making their feature film debut. The film stars John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener, with John Malkovich as a satirical version of himself. Cusack plays a puppeteer who finds a portal that leads into Malkovich&#x27;s mind. Released by USA Films, the film received widespread acclaim, with praise for its writing and direction, and grossed $23 million against a $13 million budget. The film was nominated in three categories at the 72nd Academy Awards: Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress for Keener. The film ranked 441st on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 greatest films of all time, while Malkovich&#x27;s performance is ranked number 90 on &quot;Premiere&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time&quot;.

== Plot ==

Craig Schwartz is an unemployed puppeteer in New York City, in a forlorn marriage with his pet-obsessed wife, Lotte. He finds work as a file clerk for the eccentric Dr. Lester in the Mertin-Flemmer building, on a floor between the 7th and 8th, where the ceiling is very low. He develops an attraction to co-worker Maxine Lund, who does not return his affections. While filing, Craig accidentally discovers a small hidden door. He crawls through it into a tunnel and finds himself inside the mind of actor John Malkovich. After 15 minutes, Craig is ejected, landing on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. He tells Maxine about the door, and she realizes they can sell the experience for profit.

Lotte enters the portal, and based on her experience being John Malkovich, she becomes fascinated with the idea of becoming a man. She and Craig visit Dr. Lester&#x27;s home, where Lotte finds a room filled with Malkovich memorabilia. Maxine arranges a date with Malkovich while he is inhabited by Lotte, who becomes smitten with Maxine. She reciprocates, but only when Lotte is inside Malkovich; Maxine manipulates him into having sex with her while Lotte is in his mind. Craig, forsaken by both women, locks Lotte in a cage and forces her to set up another tryst with Maxine. He inhabits Malkovich instead and discovers that his puppeteering skills allow him some control over Malkovich.

Meanwhile, the real Malkovich, disturbed by his loss of control, confides in his friend Charlie Sheen and becomes suspicious of Maxine. Malkovich follows her to the office, where she and Craig are charging customers to use the portal. When Malkovich enters it himself, he finds himself in a world where everyone looks like him and says only &quot;Malkovich.&quot; After he is ejected, he demands that Craig close the portal, but Craig refuses. Lotte is freed by her pet chimpanzee and warns Maxine that Craig is inhabiting Malkovich, but Maxine is attracted to Craig&#x27;s ability to control him.

Lotte confronts Dr. Lester, who reveals that he is, in fact, Captain Mertin, who, having discovered the portal to a &quot;vessel body&quot; in the late 1800s, erected the Mertin-Flemmer building to conceal it. He has obtained immortality by moving from one body to the next, which becomes &quot;ripe&quot; on the host&#x27;s 44th birthday, allowing him to take possession. If he were to enter the portal past midnight on that day, he would instead be trapped in the next newborn vessel, helpless inside the new host&#x27;s mind. This time, Lester has invited a group of friends to join him in occupying Malkovich once he turns 44, and Lotte warns them that Craig has taken control.

Craig discovers he can occupy Malkovich indefinitely. Inhabiting him over the next eight months, he makes Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer and marries Maxine. Later, Maxine discovers that she is pregnant. On Malkovich&#x27;s 44th birthday, Lester and Lotte kidnap Maxine. They call to demand that Craig leave Malkovich, threatening to kill Maxine, but he hangs up. In desperation, Lotte decides to shoot Maxine, who escapes into the portal. Lotte pursues her through Malkovich&#x27;s subconscious before they are both ejected. Maxine confesses that she kept her unborn child because it was conceived while Lotte was in Malkovich&#x27;s mind, meaning that it is Lotte&#x27;s child, too, and the women cement their love for each other.

Craig, believing Maxine is still in danger, leaves Malkovich&#x27;s mind, allowing Lester and his friends to enter. Discovering that Maxine has discarded him for Lotte, Craig swears to reenter the portal to take back Malkovich&#x27;s mind. Seven years later, an older Malkovich, now inhabited by multiple people, tells Sheen about Lester and his friends&#x27; plan to extend their lives via the portal, which now leads to the mind of Maxine&#x27;s daughter Emily. Craig, who entered the portal too late, is permanently trapped inside Emily, forced to watch Lotte and Maxine live happily together.

== Cast ==
=== Cameo appearances ===
Director Spike Jonze makes a cameo appearance as Derek Mantini&#x27;s assistant; Mantini is billed in the story as the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world and arouses Craig&#x27;s envy. Brad Pitt also has a brief cameo, as a miffed star in the documentary on Malkovich&#x27;s career, who seems to be on the verge of saying something before the shot ends. Sean Penn appears as himself, a fan of Malkovich&#x27;s puppeteer work. Film director David Fincher makes an uncredited appearance as Christopher Bing in the American Arts &amp; Culture pseudo-documentary on John Malkovich. Winona Ryder, Andy Dick, and the members of Hanson can be seen in the audience of a Malkovich puppet show.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Writer Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s idea of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; originated simply as &quot;a story about a man who falls in love with someone who is not his wife.&quot; Gradually he added further elements to the story which he found entertaining, such as floor of the Mertin Flemmer building; among his first ideas, Malkovich was &quot;nowhere to be seen&quot;. He wrote the script on spec in 1994 and though it was widely read by production company and film studio executives, all turned it down. Hoping to find a producer, Kaufman sent the script to Francis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his daughter&#x27;s then boyfriend Spike Jonze.

Jonze first read the script in 1996 and had agreed to direct the film by 1997. Jonze took the script to Propaganda Films, which agreed to produce the film in partnership with production company Single Cell Pictures. Single Cell producers Michael Stipe and Sandy Stern pitched the film to numerous studios, including New Line Cinema, who dropped the project after chairman Robert Shaye asked, &quot;Why the fuck can&#x27;t it be &quot;Being Tom Cruise&quot;?&quot; Jonze recalled that Malkovich asked the same question, and that Malkovich had felt that &quot;Either the movie&#x27;s a bomb and it&#x27;s got not only my name above the title but my name in the title, so I&#x27;m fucked that way; or it does well and I&#x27;m just forever associated with this character.&quot; Jonze explained in the same interview that he had not realized how brave Malkovich&#x27;s performance was.

With a budget of $10 million, principal photography of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; began on July 20, 1998, and continued through August. Filming took place primarily in Los Angeles; specific locations included the University of Southern California campus and the Observation Bar on board the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.

The puppets were created by Kamela Portuges-Robbins and Images in Motion. Phillip Huber animated the puppets. About Huber&#x27;s puppetry, Jonze has said he was a full-time puppeteer and controlled his puppets with impressive means, such as using strings and no rods to control them, as well as swinging the puppets on high wires.

===Casting===
Diaz&#x27;s make-up artist Gucci Westman described styling Diaz in the role as &quot;a challenge, to make her look homely.&quot; The script included minimal physical descriptions of characters, and thus when Diaz took up the role she did not know that &quot;people weren&#x27;t going to recognize me.&quot; Cusack read the film&#x27;s script after he had asked his agent to present him with the &quot;craziest, most unproduceable script you can find.&quot; Impressed with the script, he asked his agent to follow its progress and book him an audition, which won him the role.

Keener cited &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; as an instance of her taking up a role based on the director&#x27;s previous work. She had heard about Jonze&#x27;s experience with music videos and took up the part of Maxine although she initially disliked the character and did not feel that she was right for the part. She was subsequently nominated for an Oscar.

Kaufman said that there was never another actor in Malkovich&#x27;s place in the script: &quot;The screenplay was always &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, even before I had any expectation that John Malkovich would even read the script.&quot; He chose Malkovich because he believed there to be &quot;an enigmatic quality about him that works&quot;, though Malkovich was partly chosen because of the sound of his name in repetition. Kaufman explained that &quot;When we were thinking of alternatives, we found that a lot of them weren&#x27;t fun to say.&quot; Jonze&#x27;s then-father-in-law Francis Ford Coppola was able to contact Malkovich, and Jonze flew with producer Sandy Stern to Malkovich&#x27;s home in France. Stern said that Malkovich was &quot;half intrigued and half horrified&quot; when he first read the script, but he eventually agreed to star in the film.

=== Theatrical release and box office ===
&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; was given limited release in the United States theatres on October 22, 1999, and opened across 25 screens. On its opening weekend, the film grossed US$637,731 across 25 screens with a per-screen average of $25,495. It expanded to another 150 screens the following week, bringing in $1.9 million with a per-screen average of $10,857. In its third week, the film&#x27;s release widened to 467 locations and grossed $2.4 million, averaging a lower $5,041 per screen with a cumulative gross of $6.1 million. It moved into a wide release the next week, expanding to 591 screens, and grossed $1.9 million with a 20% drop in ticket sales. Its fifth week brought in $2.2 million with a 17% increase in ticket sales, which dropped a further 33% the following week despite further expansion to 624 screens. It finished its theatrical run after 26 weeks with a total gross of $22,863,596.

PolyGram Filmed Entertainment was originally supposed to release this film outside the United States. However, as a result of Seagram acquiring PolyGram&#x27;s assets, its film division was folded into a new entity named Universal Pictures International, with all projects in different stages of development now transferred to that company. The film opened in the United Kingdom in March 2000, earning £296,282 in its debut week and closing after fifteen weeks with a total gross of £1,098,927. In France, the film opened in December 1999 with a gross of US$546,000 from 94 venues and went on to further success due to positive reviews and word of mouth. It grossed $205,100 from 109 screens on its opening weekend in Italy and ticket sales dropped by 37% the following week with a cumulative gross of $480,000 from 82 screens. Its German release brought in a total of $243,071. &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; had a total foreign gross of $9,523,455, combined with its domestic gross to give an international total of over $32 million.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; was initially released in 2000 on VHS, both as a regular edition and a limited edition collector&#x27;s set, and on DVD, with special features including a theatrical trailer, TV spots, cast and crew biographies, the director&#x27;s photo album and featurettes on floor 7½ and puppeteering. A special edition DVD, released later the same year, included the aforementioned features, an interview with Jonze and two behind-the-scenes featurettes. It was released on HD DVD in 2008. The Criterion Collection released a special edition of the film on Blu-ray and DVD in 2012.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Smart, funny, and highly original, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; supports its wild premise with skillful direction and a stellar ensemble cast.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 90 out of 100 based on 36 critics reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert awarded the film a full four stars, writing: &quot;What an endlessly inventive movie this is! Charlie Kaufman, the writer of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, supplies a dazzling stream of inventions, twists, and wicked paradoxes. And the director, Spike Jonze, doesn&#x27;t pounce on each one like fresh prey, but unveils it slyly, as if there&#x27;s more where that came from... The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard-pressed; we&#x27;re enchanted by one development after the next&quot;. He concluded: &quot;Every once in a long, long while a movie comes along that is unlike any other. A movie that creates a new world for us and uses it to produce wonderful things. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was a movie like that, and so in different ways were &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;After Hours&quot;, &quot;Babe&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;. What do such films have in common? Nothing. That&#x27;s the point. Each one stakes out a completely new place and colonizes it with limitless imagination. Either &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains.&quot; He later named it the best film of 1999. Peter Rainer, writing for &quot;New York&quot;, commented that &quot;dazzlingly singular movies aren&#x27;t often this much fun&quot; and Owen Gleiberman, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, called it &quot;the most excitingly original movie of the year.&quot;

<doc id="349958" wikidata="Q355231" url="?curid=349958" title="Honda NT650">
<text>The Honda Hawk GT (NT650) motorcycle was designated as model RC31 and was designed by Toshiaki Kishi, and was the second Honda bike with &quot;Pro-Arm&quot; suspension after the RC30 VFR750R.

The Hawk GT is one of the first modern naked bikes along with the Yamaha SRX, which were both released several years before the Ducati Monster and eventually the Suzuki SV650. The Hawk GT is often described as a cult bike.

== North American model ==
The US model NT650, Hawk GT 647, RC31 was introduced in 1988 and produced through 1991. It has an aluminium box frame with the separate rear frame bolted on, and a chain-drive, single-sided swingarm.

Priced above other entry-level models and only slightly below many 600 cc sport bikes, the Hawk GT did not sell well in American markets.

There are only very minor changes between the 1988 model year and the 1989-1991 model years. In 1989, the front suspension damper rods were changed to have only two (rather than four for the 1988) holes. The front brake calipers were also changed to have screw-on covers over the mounting pins. In 1991, the oil lines were run internally through the engine, rather than externally. The Canadian model was identical to the US model except for the colors. In the US, the 1988 model was offered in Tempest Gray and Tanzanite Blue. In subsequent years, Bright Red only was offered in the US.

The 1988 model had a wet weight of . The &quot;650 cc&quot; engine had a claimed output of @ 5000 rpm.

== European model ==
A cousin to the Hawk GT, the NTV 600 &quot;Revere&quot; was available in Europe from 1988 to 1992. It had an integrated steel frame, larger fuel tank (19 litres or 4.2 imperial gallons), a lower and stubbier silencer, shaft drive, single-sided alloy swinging arm at rear with adjustable monoshock and a centre stand. It was launched as a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s&quot; motorcycle but was seen as expensive for what was on offer.

The 600 Revere was replaced in 1993 by the bored-out NTV650 (the Revere name being dropped in the UK), with a cheaper specification (including tubular handlebars instead of alloy bars, cheaper instruments and horns, some supplied without a centre stand), and continued with the &quot;stubby&quot; silencer until 1995 and later models got a full-length silencer to comply with updated noise regulations. The price was reduced compared to the Revere, and this later model sold better.

The NTV650 was replaced in 1998 by the Spanish built NT650V Deauville, a much heavier fully-faired model with integral small panniers and a steel double-sided swinging arm.

== Japan model ==
Named the Bros in Japan, because the two different engine displacement versions conceived together as &quot;brothers&quot;, the Bros came in versions, with the Bros 400 being designated NC25. After Honda stopped exporting the Hawk in 1992, they continued the Bros in Japan for one more year. A close ratio gear box (which drops into the Hawk), different wheels, and lower clip-ons were the major changes. A &quot;Motor Cycle News&quot; review said the Bros 400 is &quot;heavy, underpowered and outdated, ... but surprisingly nice to ride – they’re well balanced, steer well and the engine is flexible, torquey and characterful given its 33bhp output. The Bros version is chain driven instead of using a shaft drive, lightening the unspring weight of the bike considerably. The Bros has a comfy, semi-upright café racer riding position.&quot;

<doc id="349969" wikidata="Q6514453" url="?curid=349969" title="Project Orbiter">
<text>Project Orbiter was a proposed United States spacecraft, an early competitor to Project Vanguard. It was jointly run by the United States Army and United States Navy. It was ultimately rejected by the Ad Hoc Committee on Special Capabilities, which selected Project Vanguard instead. Although the project was canceled on 3 August 1955, the basic design was used for the Juno I rocket which launched Explorer 1, the first satellite launched by the United States.

== Proposal ==
In the 1920s and 1930s, the German Society for Space Travel (&quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt,&quot; referred to as &quot;VfR&quot; by its founders) began to gain in popularity, with membership growing from outside of Germany as well as within. The primary cause for the &quot;VfR&#x27;s&quot; gaining worldwide appeal was due to the writings of mathematician Hermann Oberth who detailed, in a 1923 publication entitled &quot;The Rocket into Interplanetary Space&quot;, the mechanics of placing a satellite into Earth orbit.

Herman Potočnik was the first to publish the concept of placing a geosynchronous satellite in geostationary orbit, in 1928. Arthur C. Clarke popularized this concept even further in 1945, in a paper entitled &quot;Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?&quot;, published in &quot;Wireless World&quot; magazine. Clarke described the concept as useful for communications satellites.

In 1954, Wernher von Braun proposed the idea of placing a satellite into orbit at a meeting of Spaceflight committee of the American Rocket Society. His plan was to use a Redstone rocket with clusters of small solid-fuel rockets on top.

Also in 1954, in a private discussion about the Redstone project with Ernst Stuhlinger, von Braun expressed his belief that they should have a &quot;real, honest-to-goodness scientist&quot; involved in their little unofficial satellite project (Project Orbiter). &quot;I&#x27;m sure you know a scientist somewhere who would fill the bill, possibly in the Nobel Prize class, willing to work with us and to put some instruments on our satellite&quot;. Stuhlinger, himself a cosmic ray researcher at the University of Tübingen under his faculty advisor, Hans Geiger, had worked with James Van Allen at White Sands Missile Range with V-2 rockets, was ready with his reply: &quot;Yes, of course, I will talk to Dr. Van Allen&quot;.

Stuhlinger followed this by a visit with Van Allen at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, where Van Allen was on sabbatical leave from University of Iowa to work on stellarator design. Van Allen later recounted, &quot;Stuhlinger&#x27;s 1954 message was simple and eloquent. By virtue of ballistic missile developments at Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), it was realistic to expect that within a year or two a small scientific satellite could be propelled into a durable orbit around the Earth.[&quot;sic&quot;] ... I expressed a keen interest in performing a worldwide survey of the cosmic-ray intensity above the atmosphere&quot;.

On 26 January 1956 at the Symposium on &quot;The Scientific Uses of Earth Satellites&quot; at the University of Michigan, sponsored by the Upper Atmosphere Research Panel, James Van Allen proposed the use of U.S. satellites for cosmic-ray investigations. Ernst Stuhlinger, from von Braun&#x27;s team noted this presentation and stayed in contact with Van Allen&#x27;s Iowa Group. Through &quot;preparedness and good fortune&quot;, van Allen later wrote, the experiment was selected as the principal payload (Explorer 1) for the first flight of a four-stage Juno I rocket on 1 February 1958 (GMT).

<doc id="349972" wikidata="Q1752130" url="?curid=349972" title="Uke (martial arts)">
<text>() is in Japanese martial arts the person who &quot;receives&quot; a technique. The exact role of &quot;uke&quot; varies between the different arts and often within the art itself depending on the situation. For instance, in aikido, judo kata, and bujinkan ninjutsu, &quot;uke&quot; initiates an attack against their partner, who then defends, whereas in competition judo, there is no designated &quot;uke&quot;.

An &quot;uke&quot; typically partners with a partner or nominal opponent. The latter person may be referred to by any of several terms, again depending on the art or situation. They include , and .

==&quot;Ukemi&quot;==
The action of &quot;uke&quot; is called &quot;taking .&quot; Literally translated as &quot;receiving body&quot;, it is the art of knowing how to respond correctly to an attack and often incorporates skills to allow one to do so safely. These skills can include moves similar to tumbling and are often used as a valid exercise in itself. In aikido and judo training for instance, many classes begin with &quot;ukemi&quot; training as conditioning.

===Forms===
* / – a forward roll from the leading foot&#x27;s shoulder to the hip on the opposite side.
* / – a forward breakfall. This can be in the form of a hard slapping breakfall or more of a forward roll like motion. There are subtleties in the different types of forward roll but the principle is that when being thrown forwards the uke (person being thrown) is able to roll out of danger in preference to sustaining an injury.
* / – a backwards roll or fall.
* / – a sideways fall.
* / / – more of a forward flip than a roll, a cross between &quot;yoko&quot; (landing) and &quot;mae ukemi&quot; (initiation), often used in response to wrist throws. &quot;Tobu&quot; (跳ぶ or 飛ぶ) is the Japanese verb for &quot;to jump&quot; and &quot;to fly&quot;.

Correct &quot;ukemi&quot; will allow the &quot;uke&quot; to suffer the least amount of damage possible from a fall. If done correctly, the force of hitting the ground will be spread out along non-critical parts of the &quot;uke&quot;s body. By properly doing &quot;ukemi&quot;, the &quot;uke&quot; can roll out of danger and move into their next course of action without being damaged too much by hitting the ground.

<doc id="349973" wikidata="Q844317" url="?curid=349973" title="Busy signal">
<text>A busy signal (or busy tone or engaged tone) in telephony is an audible call-progress tone or audible signal to the calling party that indicates failure to complete the requested connection of that particular telephone call.

The busy signal has become less common in the past few decades due to the prevalence of call waiting and voicemail.

==Reasons for a busy signal==
An otherwise unspecified busy signal indicates that the called number is occupied:
* The called number is talking with another caller on the phone
* The number is calling out
* Someone else has called the number or is calling the number at the same time
* The other line was left off-hook
* It is otherwise unavailable

The standard busy signal sometimes occurs (sometimes with an intercept message played over the busy) at the end of a call to indicate the other party has hung up (see Disconnect tone), but mostly the off-hook tone is used. In some phone companies in the United Kingdom, the busy signal is played after the dial tone to indicate the caller has used up their allocated time to dial a number and must hang up, before the off-hook tone is played.

==The &quot;beep line&quot; ==

In the mid 1950s through the early 1980s, a telephone busy signal provided an early form of social media in many cities and towns of the United States, colloquially known as the &quot;beep line&quot; or &quot;jam line&quot;. Due to a flaw in the telephone switching equipment, teenagers discovered they could talk to each other over the busy signal, often exchanging phone numbers, mostly for the purpose of dating. Common phone numbers for this to form were on popular radio station request lines, where teens would be calling in en masse to try to win concert tickets or request their favorite songs, thus &quot;jamming the lines&quot; and generating a perpetual busy signal.

==Reorder tone==
A reorder tone, sometimes called a &quot;fast busy&quot; signal, indicates that no transmission path to the called number is available. This can occur either because the Inter-LATA trunk is busy at the time of the call- in which case this clears in a few seconds, if one redials- or the number is temporarily out of service, due to maintenance or the number is not willing to accept calls. It is otherwise played after a recorded announcement explaining the reason for a general call failure.

==Styles==
Countries have different signaling tones that act as busy signals, in most cases consisting of a tone with equal on/off periods at a rate of between 60 and 120 interruptions per minute (i.p.m.).

In North America, the Precise Tone Plan used today employs two tones of 480 and 620 Hz at an amplitude of -24 dBm with a 0.5 s on/off cadence. Prior to the adoption of the PreciseTone system, the busy signal generally had the same frequency as the dial tone. Until frequencies began to be standardized in the 1960s, telephone signals varied from telephone exchange to exchange.

The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) recommendation for busy tone is a 425 Hz tone at -20dBm in a 0.5 s on/off cadence. This sequence was already in use in Portugal, Spain, The Netherlands, (West-)Germany, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Iceland, Norway, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City prior to publication of the ETSI recommendation.

The ETSI recommendation is now followed by all countries of the European Union. Historical oddities within the EU are:

* Ireland follows the ETSI recommendation for the busy tone, but the ringback tone is the same as that used in the UK.
* A few networks in France continue to use a 440 Hz/0.5 s sequence in place of the ETSI recommended 425 Hz/0.5 s sequence, but this is gradually being replaced.
The ETSI recommendation is also the default (i.e. non-localized) busy tone generated by mobile phones that follow the GSM &amp; 3GPP family of standards.

The ETSI recommendation is also followed by some ISDN equipment and PBX/office systems found outside Europe.

Most countries of the former Soviet Union, including Russia, are not members of the ETSI. These former Soviet republics employ a 425 Hz busy tone with a 0.4 s on/off cadence.

In the United Kingdom, the busy tone is a single 400 Hz tone with equal 0.375 s on/off periods. This was the case even when the UK was still part of the EU. The current 400 Hz/375ms tone was adopted in the mid-to-late 1960s and replaced the older busy tone, which was the same 400 Hz signal but at half the pulse duration, 0.75 s on, 0.75 s off.

<doc id="349977" wikidata="Q7564188" url="?curid=349977" title="Soul City, North Carolina">
<text>Soul City is a community in Warren County, North Carolina, United States. It was a planned community first proposed in 1969 by Floyd McKissick, a civil rights leader and director of the Congress of Racial Equality. Funded by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Soul City was one of thirteen model city projects under the Urban Growth and New Community Development Act. It was located on in Warren County near Manson-Axtell Road and Soul City Boulevard in Norlina.

==Background==

After the 1968 Civil Rights bill was passed, many civil rights activists focused on the economic development in black communities so African Americans could take advantage of the resources they had recently won. Following his departure from CORE, McKissick founded McKissick Enterprises in August 1968, a company which was supposed to &quot;create and distribute profits to millions of black Americans&quot; by investing in and providing technical advice to black-run businesses. It invested in a variety of projects. Following the promulgation of the New Communities Act, McKissick tasked his staff with drafting a plan for a new city in the South, figuring that new planned community there would attract more interest if it was located there rather than elsewhere.

Wanting to improve conditions in his home state and feeling that it was more politically and economically progressive than its other Southern contemporaries, McKissick settled on locating the community in North Carolina. He tasked former legal colleague T. T. Clayton with discreetly searching for potential sites. After rejecting a property in Halifax County as too small for his ambitions, McKissick took interest in a 1,800 site in Warren County. Named the Circle P Ranch, the land was a cattle and timber farm owned by Leon Perry, who was losing money and eager to sell. Once a tobacco plantation, it contained woods, pastures, creeks, old agricultural buildings, centered around a historic manor house. 

Warren County was a majority black rural area facing economic downturn. It was the third poorest county in the state and was experiencing the largest population decline in the state. Educational attainment rates were low. Services and utilities in the area near the ranch were minimal. The house was serviced by electricity and the site had several wells and septic tanks, but there was no centralized water or sewage access and only one proximate paved road. Despite these problems, McKissick felt optimistic about the property&#x27;s potential owing to low regional labor costs—which were beneficial to attracting industry, its geographic centrality relative to major urban centers within 500 miles, and its proximity to U.S. Route 1 and the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. There were also adjacent tracts amounting to—in Clayton&#x27;s estimation—5,000 acres which could be further acquired. Kerr Lake, several miles away, was well placed to serve as a reservoir for a city. He also felt that establishing a planned community to help blacks on a former plantation once owned a by a segregationist legislator would have symbolic resonance.

Clayton negotiated with Perry to purchase the land for $390,000. On December 19, 1968, Clayton paid Perry $4,000 for a 60-day option to purchase his ranch. Clayton and McKissick, with Perry&#x27;s assent, subsequently assigned the option interest to McKissick Enterprises. On January 13, McKissick held a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman to announce his intent to build a planned community called &quot;Soul City&quot; in Warren County. McKissick argued that the project would help ameliorate issues of black outmigration from the South and urban decay in major American cities by &quot;helping to put new life into a depressed area&quot; and &quot;helping to stem the flood of migrants to the already over-crowded and decaying cities&quot;. While insisting that Soul City would &quot;be open to residents of all colors&quot;, he emphasized that the town would generate &quot;new careers for black people&quot; and that it would &quot;be an attempt to move into the future, a future where black people welcome white people as equals&quot;.

McKissick&#x27;s announcement generated a significant amount of media attention, with the Big Three television networks each covering it on their evening news programs and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporting on it in a front page story. Some outlets, such as &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; and &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, expressed skepticism at the economic viability of the project, while others such as the &quot;Greensboro Daily News&quot; and journalist Claude Sitton feared that it would manifest itself as an experiment in black separatism and clash with the integrationist goals of the civil rights movement. McKissick, though continuing to emphasize the role blacks would play in the project, was incensed by the characterization of his project as separatist, telling one newspaper, &quot;This is neither integration nor segregation, but letting black people do what ever they damn please, and go where they please.&quot; Some progressives, such as Elizabeth Tornquist of the &quot;North Carolina Anvil&quot;, attacked the plan for relying too much on capitalism, which they considered exploitative and predisposed to enrich the project&#x27;s leaders while unlikely to provide any long term benefit to poor blacks. Response from black newspapers was generally optimistic, and McKissick received some favorable correspondence from blacks around the country. Several black leaders and activists expressed skepticism at the proposal, such as National Urban League director Whitney Young. Reactions in Warren County were mixed, with many locals surprised by McKissick&#x27;s announcement. Perry received death threats for offering the sale to McKissick and briefly fled to Florida.

== Establishment and planning ==
In the weeks following his press conference, McKissick retained architecture firm Ifill Johnson Hanchard to design Soul City and a consulting firm to provide economic analysis. He focused most of his efforts on securing the financing necessary to purchase Perry&#x27;s ranch. After making unsuccessful entreaties to several institutions, he met with executives of Chase Bank and asked them to lend him $390,000. They eventually agreed to loan him $200,000 out of an affiliated bank in Lumberton. Unable to secure an additional bank loan, McKissick agreed to purchase the land with a loan from Perry for the remainder of the balance with the promise that he would pay it off within a year. He officially received the deed for the property on February 21, 1969. Securing some additional funding from Rhode Island businessman Irving Fain, McKissick then reluctantly sought out grants from the federal government. A few months later the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development granted $243,000 to the state of North Carolina which, with the quiet support of Governor Bob Scott, forwarded over half of the money to McKissick&#x27;s newly-established Warren Regional Planning Corporation. Chase Bank also extended McKissick $200,000 in additional credit.

Confronted with Ifill Johnson Hanchard&#x27;s lack of expertise in urban planning, McKissick hired architect Harvey Gantt to plan Soul City. Heavily influenced by the layout of Columbia, Maryland, Gantt envisioned Soul City to be a collection of villages oriented around a core area which would include amenities such as a mall, a hospital, a college, and a central library. Each village was to have unique aesthetics but all were to include residential structures of mixed density centered around their own &quot;activity center&quot;, which would include basic social and commercial amenities. North of the town core and proximate to the railway and the highway was to be an 800-acre industrial park. Between the park and the town center there would be a man-made lake which would provide water for firefighting protection. A boulevard running north-to-south through the middle of the community and a ring road passing through the villages would serve as the major transportation arteries. Sidewalks were to be wide and bike paths were to link the villages together. For recreation and to preserve the community&#x27;s rustic setting, Gantt planned for five community parks, one central park, and several dozen playgrounds and picnic areas. One third of the land in the community was to remain undeveloped natural area. Gantt devoted little time to the design of individual structures, but in his early draft depicted 1970s contemporary styles which included modular and sleek styles with minimal ornamentation and the use of glass, brick, and concrete.

McKissick was keen to develop a community with a healthy social atmosphere and cohesive culture. To that end, he created the Soul City Foundation, a non-profit organization led by Eva Clayton, to develop social life in the community. McKissick reach an agreement with Warren County officials to work to find funding for the construction of a school which the county could operate for local children until its student body was of sufficient size to be self-sustaining at which point its control would be relinquished to the community. After studying different models for public governance, McKissick decided to petition the Warren County Board of Commissions and the North Carolina Board of Health to create a Soul City Sanitary District, which would collect taxes and fund the provision of water, sewer, waste collection, and firefighting services.

== Development ==
In late 1969, McKissick purchased four residential trailers and one office trailer and moved them to the Circle P. Ranch. Over the following weeks the trailers were occupied by McKissick&#x27;s staff and their families. Over the following months the staff focused on cleaning out a barn for use as an office and the Green Duke House for use as a community center. McKissick remained in New York but visited every few weeks with his wife and sometimes some of his children. He and his wife moved to the community in mid-1971.

==Goals and plans==
Soul City was intended to be a new town built from the ground up and open to all races, while placing an emphasis on providing opportunities for minorities and the poor. It was also designed to be a means of reversing out-migration of minorities and the poor to urban areas; the opportunities Soul City provided, such as jobs, education, housing, training, and other social services would help lessen the migration.

The city was planned to contain three villages housing 18,000 people by 1989. Soul City was projected to have 24,000 jobs and 44,000 inhabitants by 2004. It was intended to include industry and retail development for jobs, as well as residential housing and services. The plan was for residents to work, get schooling, shop, receive health care, and worship in town. Soul City was the first new town to be organized by African-American businesses. McKissick envisioned Soul City as a community where all races could live in harmony.

==Federal funding and political opposition==

McKissick believed the way to improve the economic situation of African Americans at that time was through black capitalism. He said, &quot;Unless the Black Man attains economic independence, any political independence will be an illusion. Richard Nixon supported Black capitalism, and McKissick backed Nixon in his 1972 re-election in efforts to get more funding from HUD. In 1972, the city received a grant of $14 million from HUD based on plans of attracting industry as well as developing residential housing and by the late 1970s, the city had received more than $19 million federal funds with an additional $8 million from state and local sources.

The U.S. Senator Jesse Helms, repeatedly attacked the project as a boondoggle and a waste of taxpayer money. A series of articles in the Raleigh &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot; falsely accused McKissick of fraud and corruption and a congressional audit of the development stalled progress for nine months, only to clear Soul City of the charges leveled against it.

==Rise and decline==
By 1974, pioneering families moved to Soul City and steady progress was apparent in the laying of water and sewer lines, construction of roads, a day care center, a health care center, and early construction of &quot;Soul Tech I&quot; (with 52,000 square feet of industrial space). In 1977, the community lake was completed.
Soul City&#x27;s decline was caused by several factors, such as the local economy of Warren County, the national economy, and negative press coverage. Warren County had over 40% of people not graduating high school. The shortage of skilled laborers and lack of industrial experience deterred some industries from moving to Soul City. The US economy had a major downturn in 1974 as inflation hit double digits in 1973 and 1974. For the rest of the decade, the country went through &quot;stagflation&quot;, &quot;the simultaneous burden of inflation and unemployment.&quot; The state of the national economy made many industrial companies cautious of expanding. The Soul City Company (SCC) reported that CC Grander, a utility company and Burlington Industries, a textile company both had plans to move to Soul City but halted their expansion during the economic uncertainty of the country. The HUD&#x27;s new town programs were signed and launched during the country&#x27;s economic downturn. Some argue that Soul City as well as other new town programs would have succeeded if there had not been an economic recession. Michael Spear, the former general manager of the new town of Columbia, Maryland, commented that &quot;launching a new towns program in the early 1970s was like asking the Wright brothers to test their airplane in a hurricane and then concluding, when it crashed, that the invention did not work.&quot;

The negative press coverage of some media companies deterred not just industries but also white homeowners. The press covered Soul City as a &quot;new black town&quot;, which made it unappealing for white residents to move in. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, which had significant credence in the business community, negatively portrayed McKissick as a lawyer with a lavish lifestyle. The &quot;Journal&quot; damaged McKissick&#x27;s name and identity, which negatively impacted his efforts in bringing in new industry. The city failed to reach its initial ambitions. Lawsuits and investigations into the use of funds by the Soul City Company, the city&#x27;s developers, resulted in foreclosure in 1979 despite eventually being cleared by a Government Accountability Office audit.

HUD pulled its funding for Soul City in 1979. McKissick remained living in Soul City until his death in 1991. He was buried on his family&#x27;s property.

== Post-HUD history ==

In the mid-1980s a sportswear company opened a sewing operation in Soul Tech I. The population of Soul City grew to about 300, and later in the decade an affordable housing complex was built in the Green Duke Village. Several additional single-family houses were also constructed, mostly at the behest of retirees. In 1989, some investors purchased 100 acres of Soul City land to develop into an industrial park, but their plans never came to fruition after failing to attract industry. In 1994, North Carolina announced the construction of medium-security prison in Soul City. The reception from locals was mixed, with some opposed to the project and others feeling it would create jobs. The Warren Correctional Institution was completed in 1997. Several years later state prison officials purchased Soul Tech I and converted it into a prison factory for producing janitorial supplies.

Population decline in the late 1980s and 1990s led to decreasing revenue for homeowners&#x27; association responsible for the management of Green Duke Village. As a result, the physical infrastructure of Soul City degraded and Warren County government assumed control of the Magnolia Ernest Recreation Complex and opened it to the public. In the mid-2000s the land on which the Soul City monolith was located was sold and the new owner indicated her intention to demolish it. After a public outcry from local residents, county officials moved the sign to the entrance of Green Duke Village. In 2009, HealthCo closed due to an inquiry into its finances.

<text>Ernest Arthur Coombs, CM (November 26, 1927 – September 18, 2001) was an American-Canadian children&#x27;s entertainer who starred in the Canadian television series &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot; (1967–1996).

His career began as an assistant puppeteer to Fred Rogers, joining him in Canada when his employer was invited to produce a variant of his local Pittsburgh show for CBC Television, &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; on a national series, &quot;Mister Rogers&quot;. When Rogers decided to return to the United States, Coombs chose to stay in Canada on his employer&#x27;s recommendation, developing the children&#x27;s show &quot;Butternut Square&quot;, which later evolved into &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot;, which went on to become a long-running and iconic presence in Canadian media. He eventually became a Canadian citizen and became a honouree of the Order of Canada, among other honours.

==Television performances==
Ernest Coombs was born in Lewiston, Maine, and pursued a career in children&#x27;s entertainment after attending North Yarmouth Academy in Yarmouth, Maine. He was assistant puppeteer to Fred Rogers, working with him at WQED in Pittsburgh on Rogers&#x27;s noontime program, &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;. Rogers and Coombs became close friends and when Rogers was offered a show in 1962 at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, he invited Coombs to join him in Canada to work on an early version of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, called &quot;Misterogers&quot;. Rogers moved back to the United States three years later, but Coombs decided to stay in Canada upon his employer&#x27;s recommendation to the network, joining a new TV series called &quot;Butternut Square&quot;. &quot;Butternut Square&quot; ran from 1964 to 1967. During the run, Coombs appeared as the character in the Poor Alex Theatre in &quot;The Tickle Trunk&quot;, starring Mr. Dressup with Casey and Finnegan.

After &quot;Butternut Square&quot; ended, Coombs developed &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot;, which became one of English Canada&#x27;s longest-running and most beloved children&#x27;s programs. As Mr. Dressup, he presented arts and crafts, songs, stories and games for children with his friends Casey and Finnegan, a child and a dog who lived in a treehouse in Mr. Dressup&#x27;s back yard. Casey was given a unisex name intentionally, because the character&#x27;s childlike voice left Casey&#x27;s sex ambiguous. Over the years, when viewers would ask Coombs whether Casey was a boy or a girl, he would ask, &quot;What do you think?&quot; However the questioner responded, he would say, &quot;You&#x27;re right!&quot;

Later in the series, when the show&#x27;s principal puppeteer, Judith Lawrence, retired, Casey and Finnegan were replaced by a small cast of anthropomorphic animal puppets. Coombs believed in gentle, wholesome children&#x27;s programming that encouraged kids to use their creativity and imagination. In each episode, Mr. Dressup would dress up in a costume from his Tickle Trunk, and lead children in an imagination game. Many times his puppets would appear in costume as well.

The series continued production until its final taping in February 1996, when Coombs retired, though he returned for the -hour-long &quot;Mr. Dressup&#x27;s Holiday Special&quot; in 1997. Reruns continued to be shown on CBC Television until they were discontinued on September 3, 2006.

After retirement, Coombs continued to work as an entertainer, playing roles in Ross Petty&#x27;s Christmas pantomimes of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and &quot;Aladdin&quot;; narrated a 2002 Canadian revival of the British animated television series, &quot;Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings&quot;; and acted as a spokesman for children&#x27;s charities.

Coombs also did a travelling stage show called &quot;Tales from the Tickle Trunk&quot;, in which he shared stories about the making of &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot;, as well as the origins, and fates, of some of the characters.

==Personal life==
Coombs lived with his family in the city of Pickering, Ontario. His wife Marlene (known as Lynn) ran a day care at the former SS#3 schoolhouse on Finch Avenue East west of Neilson Road in Scarborough (east Toronto), called the Butternut Learning Centre (now Whitefield Christian Academy). They had two children: Catherine and Christopher. Marlene was killed in a traffic accident in 1992; she was walking on the sidewalk of Yonge Street in Toronto, when a car hit her. The driver may have had a seizure, resulting in a loss of control of the vehicle.

Coombs became a Canadian citizen in 1994. In 1996, he was named a Member of the Order of Canada.

==Death==
Coombs suffered a stroke on September 10, 2001, and died eight days later on September 18, 2001, at the age of 73.

==Tributes==
A tribute was made to Coombs in the Canadian television show &quot;The Latest Buzz&quot;, where the school for which the show is set is named Ernie Coombs High.

On November 26, 2012, Google commemorated Coombs&#x27; 85th birthday with a Google Doodle.

Chris Whiteley wrote and recorded a song entitled &quot;The Week That Ernie Died&quot; as a tribute to Coombs.

In 2022, a &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot; documentary, to be directed by Robert McCallum, was announced by Amazon Prime Video. The documentary, &quot;Mr. Dressup: The Magic of Make-Believe&quot;, premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Documentaries.

<doc id="349979" wikidata="Q5243924" url="?curid=349979" title="Trevor Rees-Jones (bodyguard)">
<text>Trevor Rees-Jones (also known as Trevor Rees; born 3 March 1968) is a British author and former bodyguard who was badly injured and the only survivor in the car crash in Paris that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. Because he sustained a serious head injury, he does not recall any details from the crash.

Some media reports claimed he was wearing a seat belt and survived, but investigations revealed that none of the occupants of the car were wearing a seat belt.

== Early life ==
Rees-Jones was born on 3 March 1968 in Rinteln, West Germany, the middle-born of three boys of Colin Rees, a surgeon in the British Army, and Gill, a nurse. He has an older brother, Gareth, and younger brother, John. At ten, he returned with his family to Oswestry, on the Welsh border near his father&#x27;s childhood home. At Fitzalan High School, he enrolled in the Combined Cadet Force.

== Military career and first marriage ==
In 1987, Rees-Jones enlisted in the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, served one tour of duty in Northern Ireland and was awarded the General Service Medal.

On 12 August 1995, he married his first wife, Sue Jones, in Oswestry, where the couple had met at Fitzalan High School. Rees-Jones filed for divorce in June 1997.

== Car crash, injuries, and aftermath ==
On 31 August 1997, Rees-Jones was seriously injured in the crash that resulted in the death of Princess Diana. The princess&#x27;s companion, Dodi Fayed, and their chauffeur, Henri Paul, were found dead inside the car; Rees-Jones was the sole survivor of the crash. He was conscious after the crash. His face was flattened, with numerous bones broken or crushed, and was reconstructed afterwards with old family photographs for guidance by French facial doctor Luc Chikhani, with about 150 pieces of titanium to hold the bones together and to recreate the former shape. Within about one year, his face was nearly back to normal.

Hospital care costs were paid by Dodi&#x27;s father, Mohamed Al-Fayed, Rees-Jones&#x27; employer at the time of the crash, and the rest by the British National Health Service (NHS). At first, it was widely rumoured that Rees-Jones had lost his tongue in the crash, but this was not true. He underwent a ten-hour operation to restore his jaw to its former condition.

After spending more than a month in hospital, Rees-Jones finally returned to the United Kingdom on 3 October 1997. At the time, he was able to communicate only by whispering and writing down answers. He resigned from his job as a bodyguard on 19 May 1998. Al-Fayed was reported as saying that his job would be available if he wished to return.

== Recovery and later life ==
Following recovery from his injuries, Rees-Jones moved back to Oswestry and worked in a shop. He remarried on 15 February 2003, to Ann Scott, a teacher at Belvidere School, Shrewsbury. The ceremony took place in Welshpool, Wales.

He wrote a book, published in 2000 and titled &quot;The Bodyguard&#x27;s Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor&quot; (), about his experiences, with the help of ghostwriter Moira Johnston. The book reconstructed the events from Rees-Jones&#x27;s partial memories and those of his family and friends.

==In popular culture==
Rees-Jones is portrayed by actor Harry Anton in season 6 of the TV series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

<doc id="349981" wikidata="Q3363997" url="?curid=349981" title="Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park">
<text>Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park is a state park of California in the United States. It is located in remote northeastern Shasta County and is only accessible to the public by boat.

The park is in length and no more than wide, and has over of shoreline. It preserves a wilderness of freshwater springs and geologically recent lava flows. Waterways include the Fall River and associated creeks and lakes. The shoreline has blue bays and tree-studded islets along its length. Near the springs are the remains of fish traps built by Native Californian tribes such as the Achomawi, for whom the park is named. Low rock walls enclose shallow pools where they captured sucker and trout. About two thirds of the park&#x27;s is covered by jagged black basalt deposited in lava flows within the last two to five thousand years.

The state of California acquired the land from private owners in 1975.

==History==

Pacific Gas &amp; Electric owned large tracts of the local swampland. Much of the shoreline of the park is on Big Lake, which was created when levees and canals were installed. A muskrat farm was operated there until the 1930s. Muskrats can still be seen in the local marshes. The non-native species is notorious for altering wetland habitat, increasing the likelihood of floods.

==Visiting the park==

There are no public roads leading to the park. Private motor vehicles are prohibited within. Visitors can launch boats into Big Lake at a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) public boat launch known as Rat Farm.

There are three basic campsites. Visitors can traverse narrow waterways in canoes or kayaks. There are about 20 miles of hiking trails. Fishing is allowed but hunting is prohibited.

==Native Americans==
The name of the park honors the Achomawi (also spelled &quot;Ajumawi&quot;, &quot;Achumawi&quot;, and &quot;Ahjumawi&quot;) whose name translates to &quot;where the waters come together&quot;. The park is situated at the confluence of the Fall River, a tributary of the Pit River, with several smaller creeks and streams. The Achomawi are one of eleven bands of the Pit River Tribe of native peoples. These resident people tended the local waterways, monitoring spawning beds and limiting their catches to conserve populations of the fish they used for food. The Achomawi still live in the area.

==Natural history==

The park sits on &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s largest systems of underwater springs.&quot; They produce some of fresh water per day into the aboveground waterways. Water in the springs originate as snowmelt from the Medicine Lake Volcano highlands.

The park is in an area where the Modoc Plateau transitions to a more coastal bioregion. The former region was formed by volcanic activity and has many associated geological features, such as lava tubes and craters that fill with spring water.

The local flora includes pines, ceanothus, western juniper, birchleaf and curlleaf mountain mahogany, and Garry oak. Birds in the area include Canada geese, snow geese, American white pelicans, blue-winged teal, Lewis&#x27;s woodpeckers, northern pygmy owls, and ospreys. Other animals include black-tailed deer and coyotes.

<doc id="349982" wikidata="Q335388" url="?curid=349982" title="William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley">
<text>William Humble Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley, (25 May 1867 – 29 June 1932) was a British aristocrat, politician, and military officer who served as the fourth Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1908 to 1911. He was previously Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1902 to 1905, and also a government minister under Lord Salisbury.

Dudley was the son of William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley, and succeeded to the earldom at the age of 17. He inherited a substantial fortune and the palatial family seat at Witley Court. Dudley sat with the Conservative Party in the House of Lords, and was Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade from 1895 to 1902. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland when Arthur Balfour came to power, and was regarded as a competent administrator. His time in Dublin led to his inclusion as a character in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

In part due to the urging of King Edward VII, a longtime acquaintance, Dudley was appointed Governor-General of Australia in 1908. His extravagance and pomposity made him unpopular among the general public, and his attempts to interfere in political matters rankled both prime ministers he worked with (Andrew Fisher and Alfred Deakin). Deakin regarded him as doing &quot;nothing really important, nothing thoroughly, nothing consistently [...] very ineffective and not very popular&quot;. He was recalled to England after less than three years in office.

Dudley took command of the Queen&#x27;s Own Worcestershire Hussars in 1913. He had first joined the army as a young man, and during the Second Boer War served with the Imperial Yeomanry. In World War I, Dudley commanded the Hussars for the initial stages of the Gallipoli campaign, but he returned to England before its conclusion. He was later attached to the headquarters staff of the 40th Division, and retired with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dudley had seven children with his first wife, and was succeeded in the earldom by his oldest son William.

==Background and education==
Dudley was born in London, the son of William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley, and Georgina, daughter of Sir Thomas Moncrieff, 7th Baronet. He was educated at Eton. His father died in 1885 and he inherited nearly of mineral deposits in Staffordshire and Worcestershire, two hundred coal and iron mines, several iron works (including the Round Oak Steelworks) and a substantial fortune, as well as the Earldom. He visited Australia in 1886–87 as part of a yachting cruise. Dudley became part of the social circle of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), who attended his wedding to Rachel Gurney in 1891. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant for Worcestershire in 1893 and from 1895 to 1896 he was Mayor of Dudley.

==Early military service==
Dudley joined the Queen&#x27;s Own Worcestershire Hussars as a supernumerary lieutenant on 18 April 1885 and was promoted to captain on 2 June 1888 and major on 23 September 1893. After the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he was seconded for service as a Deputy Assistant Adjutant General for the Imperial Yeomanry in early 1900, and left for South Africa in the &quot;SS Scot&quot; in late January that year. He was present at operations in the Orange Free State in February to May 1900. Some of the actions he was involved with were at Poplar Grove, Driefontein, Vet River, and Zand River. From May to June 1900 he was present at operations in the Transvaal. Some of the actions he was involved with were Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Diamond Hill. He then return to the United Kingdom, and in July to November 1900 he was involved with the suppression of the Irish troubles in Belfast.

He was transferred from the Imperial Yeomanry to the Territorial Force on the latter&#x27;s formation on 1 April 1908, and was seconded for service with the Colonial Office on 9 April that year, when he was posted to Australia.

==Political career==

Dudley sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and served under Lord Salisbury as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade from 1895 to 1902.

After Arthur Balfour succeeded as Prime Minister, Lord Dudley was on 11 August 1902 sworn a member of the Privy Council, and appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was sworn in and formally installed as such in a ceremony at Dublin Castle on 16 August 1902, and was also appointed Grand Master of the Order of St. Patrick, as was customary for the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Through his years in Ireland, he displayed great extravagance but also some political and administrative ability. The Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 and his cooperation with George Wyndham on a devolution scheme to deal with the Home Rule question were among important milestones. He is immortalized in Joyce&#x27;s description of his Vice-Regal progress through Dublin in &quot;Ulysses&quot;. During his first visit to Belfast, in November 1902, he laid the foundation stone of the Belfast Municipal Technical Institute.

==Governor-General of Australia==

As a Conservative, Dudley could not have expected preferment from the Liberal government which came to office in 1905, but King Edward VII pressed the Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, to offer Dudley the post of Governor-General of Australia. Campbell-Bannerman agreed, since there was apparently no suitable Liberal candidate available. Dudley was appointed on 9 May 1908 and arrived in Sydney on 9 September. He soon established a reputation for pomp, ceremony and extravagance which was unwelcome to many Australians, particularly the Labor Party and the radical press such as &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. Not long after his arrival, he found himself swearing in a Labor cabinet under Andrew Fisher, so the Labor Party&#x27;s disapproval of his vice-regal style became an important issue.

The new Governor-General soon found himself involved in another controversy. It was part of Labor policy to establish an independent Australian navy. The Liberal opposition, on the other hand, supported the campaign for Australia to raise money to build ships for the Royal Navy: the so-called Dreadnought campaign. So when Dudley made a speech in support of the Dreadnought campaign, he was straying into party politics, leading to a tense relationship with Fisher. In 1909 Fisher&#x27;s minority government resigned, and Dudley refused him an early election. The Liberals returned to office under Alfred Deakin, solving Dudley&#x27;s immediate problems. But although Fisher was careful not to criticise Dudley in public, the Governor-General had acquired a reputation as &quot;anti-Labor,&quot; which made him unpopular with half the Australian electorate.

In April 1910 Labor won a sweeping election victory and Fisher returned to power. Relations between Governor-General and Prime Minister were soon once again frosty. Dudley&#x27;s insistence on maintaining two very expensive Government Houses, in Sydney and Melbourne, on travelling around the country in vice-regal pomp, and on chartering a steam yacht to circumnavigate the continent, infuriated Fisher, a frugal Scottish socialist. By October Dudley had recognised the impossibility of his position and asked to be recalled. He left Australia on 31 July 1911, unmarked by any official ceremony. Alfred Deakin wrote of him: 

==Later military service==
On 20 January 1912 Lord Dudley rejoined the establishment of the Worcestershire Hussars, and on 10 November 1913 he was promoted to succeed Sir Henry Foley Grey as lieutenant-colonel commanding the regiment. By this time he was convinced that there was going to be another war in Europe and formed a permanent staff of instructors to train the regiment in musketry. When war was declared in 1914, the Worcestershires formed part of the 1st South Midland Mounted Brigade, under the commander of Brigadier E. A. Wiggin. The brigade was ordered to Egypt and was based in Chatby Camp, near Alexandria, by April 1915. The brigade didn&#x27;t see any action until they were ordered to prepare to fight as infantry in August. It was at this time that the men were sent to Suvla Bay, and took part in the Battle of Scimitar Hill on 21 August. The regiment were in support of the Anzacs in their attempt to break through the Turkish defenses. This attack failed miserably, and they were evacuated in January 1916. Lord Dudley had already left the regiment on 22 August 1915, when he was seconded and posted to East Mudros as Commandant, where he remained until 23 November. In 1916, Lord Dudley was attached to the headquarters staff of the 40th Infantry Division. He was transferred to the Territorial Force Reserve as a lieutenant-colonel on 23 July 1916 and relinquished his commission on 30 September 1921.

== Yachting ==
On inheriting his Earldom he embarked in 1885–1886 on a round the world cruise in the 374 ton Steam Yacht Marchesa, built by Lobnitz, this voyage including meeting the Emperor of Brazil, and had a stop at Sydney to refit.

In 1892 he bought the 5-rater &quot;Dacia&quot; - one of the first Charles E Nicholson designs, from Hercules Langrishe. He then commissioned &quot;Vigorna&quot;, also from Camper and Nicholsons which was less successful. His next yacht &quot;Inyoni&quot; was more successful.

During his time as Viceroy of Ireland he was a member of the Dublin Bay and Lough Erne sailing clubs, as well as the Royal Yacht Squadron.

==Marriages and children==

Lord Dudley married firstly in 1891 Rachel Anne Gurney (born 8 August 1868), daughter of Charles Henry Gurney (born 5 November 1833), and Alice Prinsep, and maternal granddaughter of Henry Thoby Prinsep (1793–1878) and Sara Monckton Pattle (Calcutta, 1816–Brighton, 1887). Her sister Laura Gurney was the wife of Sir Thomas Herbert Cochrane Troubridge, 4th Baronet.

They had seven children:

* Lady Gladys Honor Ward (1892 – 5 December 1961)
* William Humble Eric Ward, 3rd Earl of Dudley (20 January 1894 – 26 December 1969)
* Lady Morvyth Lillian Ward (1896 – 11 March 1959)
* Lt Col Hon Roderick John Ward (13 April 1902 – 2 October 1952)
* Lady Alexandra Patrica Ward (24 August 1904 – 7 July 1964)
* Gp Capt Hon Edward Frederick Ward (20 November 1907 – 1987)
* George Reginald Ward, 1st and last Viscount Ward of Witley (20 November 1907 – 15 June 1988)

Lady Dudley took an interest in medical welfare. In Ireland, in 1903, she set up the Lady Dudley Nurses scheme to serve isolated rural communities in counties Connemara, Mayo, Donegal, and Kerry. In Australia, in 1911, she set up a similar scheme. She was interested in gardening, and in January 1903 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society.
On the outbreak of World War I Lady Dudley established the Australian Voluntary Hospital from doctors and nurse in London. She drowned on 26 June 1920, aged 51, while on a visit to Connemara.

Lord Dudley remarried, on 30 April 1924, actress Gertie Millar, daughter of John Millar.

Lord Dudley died of cancer in London on 29 June 1932 at age 65 and was succeeded by his eldest son, William. Gertie, Countess of Dudley, died in April 1952. The English actresses Georgina Ward and Rachel Ward were his granddaughter and great-granddaughter respectively.

==Honours and awards==
*Grand Master of The Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick, invested as Grand Master on 16 August 1902, on the day he was installed as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and handed over the insignia when he resigned in December 1905. He was never appointed a knight of the order.

<text>Anderson Marsh State Historic Park is a California State Historic Park and nature reserve preserving a tule marsh, archaeological sites of the Pomo people, and historic ranch structures. It is located in Lake County, California, United States. Anderson Marsh is located at the head of Cache Creek on the southeast corner of Clear Lake, the largest natural lake completely within the borders of California. The park is between the cities of Lower Lake and Clearlake on State Route 53, north of Calistoga in the wine country. The park is open year-round.

==Natural history==
The Anderson Marsh Park contains of native bunch grass-covered hills, oak woodland, and Tule &quot;(Schoenoplectus acutus)&quot; marshes. It protects several habitats including: freshwater marsh wetlands, native grasslands, California oak woodlands, and riparian woodlands. Aquatic and terrestrial wildlife include: large mouth bass, bluegill, catfish, crappie, the north-western pond turtle, bats, gray fox, frogs, garter snakes, mink, muskrats, opossums, raccoon, river otter, skunks, and toads.

Approximately 151 different bird species, both migrating and resident, have been identified in the park.

==History==
The Southeastern Pomo Native Americans, one of the largest groups of indigenous peoples of the Americas in pre-Columbian California, lived in the area of present-day Anderson Marsh State Historic Park, and their descendants continue to do so nearby. Anderson Marsh&#x27;s archaeological sites provide artifacts of the Pomo people. Some sites are among the oldest found in California, dated at over 10,000 years old. After recording 43 prehistoric sites, John Parker nominated the area to the National Register of Historic Places and began a campaign to have the sites acquired as a new State Park.

John Grigsby homesteaded in 1854 with his family, and built a small house. Scotsman John Still Anderson, with his wife and six children, bought the property from Grigsby in 1884, built what is now known as the Ranch House, and ran a dairy and raised beef cattle. Their descendants lived in the Ranch House until the 1960s.

The State Historic Park was named after John Still Anderson in 1982 after the State of California acquired the Anderson Marsh.

==Visitor attractions==

===Activities===

The park offers bird watching, hiking, a bluegrass musical festival, and interpretive programs, including a historic ranch home.

===Anderson Marsh Interpretive Association - AMIA===
The Anderson Marsh Interpretive Association (AMIA) was formed in 1984 by park staff and other volunteers. The primary objective of the association is to promote the education and interpretive activities of the park. AMIA also funds projects including: habitat conservation and restoration work, trail accessibility construction and maintenance, interpretive displays and written information, facilities, historical objects rehabilitation, and acquiring interpretive items.

====Previous closure proposals====
Anderson Marsh State Historic Park was one of 48 California state parks scheduled to close in 2008 by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for financial reasons, but the closure was eventually postponed. In July 2012, the park again faced closure as a means to achieve part of the $11 million budget reduction for the 2011/2012 fiscal year, but the passing of Assembly Bill 1478 in September 2012 indefinitely postponed the closure as well as increased the park&#x27;s future funding.

<text>Gorgonzola ( ) is a town in the Metropolitan City of Milan, Lombardy, northern Italy. It is part of the territory of the Martesana, north-east of Milan. Gorgonzola cheese is named after the town.

==History==
The first written records mentioning the village of Gorgonzola date back to the 10th century: the notary clerk of the convent of Saint Ambrose in Milan was the caretaker of the church of Saints Gervasio and Protasio in &quot;Gorgontiola&quot;. In 453 the church, located in the current suburb of Gorgonzola, was attacked by the Huns who destroyed the nearby Roman town of Argentia, causing the small village, which had grown from one &quot;mutatio&quot; (station for changing horses) to become the most densely populated of the surrounding territories.

In 1176, it joined the Lombard League and, in 1245, during clashes that followed the Peace of Constance in 1183 and which involved the heirs of Frederick Barbarossa, during the assault by Frederick II on the ramparts of Milan, the forces of Lombardy had to hold up in Gorgonzola: there were clashes amongst them and commanders of both sides were captured by their respective enemies.

In the 13th century, the town belonged directly to the Milanese family of the Della Torre, before they were ousted by the Visconti. In 1288, Gorgonzola was recorded as one of the most important churches of the diocese of Milan, and in 1510 it appears for the first time on a document, with its current name.

Towards the end of the 18th century, the town became politically significant for the area around Milan, particularly the 12th district of Lombardy, and it was vested with the power to administer 33 neighbouring towns. By the time of the Italian unification in 1861, Gorgonzola was in charge of administering only 19 of these, including one that was larger than itself: Cernusco sul Naviglio. In 1861, the population of the area was 28,496, only 4,320 of whom lived in Gorgonzola itself.

==Etymology==
For a long time, it was thought that the name derived from the Latin &quot;Curte Argentia&quot; which seems to indicate a settlement near the Roman town of Argentia, situated between Milan and Bergamo, or, according to other interpretations, a place for the horses at the 14th mile on the road towards Bergamo; over time the name would undergo the change in Curt-Argentia, Cort-argentiola and finally Gorgonzola. A more recent theory is that it takes its name from the goddess Concordia, corrupted into Corcondiola and finally to Gorgonzola.

==Climate==
Gorgonzola is located in the west of the basin of the Po Valley, and has a continental climate. Winters are cold, with heavy frost and fog, and temperatures frequently close to or below freezing. There are approximately 100 frost days per year, mostly from late November to early April, but occasionally in October or April as well.

Summers are very hot and humid, as throughout the Po Valley, but affected by very strong storms, destructive and often accompanied by lightning, hail and strong winds. The storms are most common in July and often cause significant cooling. Even in midsummer, cool days with temperatures of 12–15 °C are possible, and the months between June and August are quite rainy.

Overall, rainfall in Gorgonzola is very abundant and relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. However, winter months are drier, with a low of about in January. Snow falls from November to March and accumulations can be substantial. The average accumulations per event is around . Total episodes of snow in a year are never more than ten.

Humidity is high throughout the year, especially in the winter months and during the night. Rainy and foggy days are becoming less frequent, although the total annual rainfall has not changed significantly. The mists are favoured by the clear skies, which allow cooling from radiation.

==Economy==

In 2008, there were 1,223 companies in the municipality with a total of 4,770 employees. Of these, 1,461 employees were in industry, 688 in the commerce sector, and 2,233 in the service sector.

==Transport==
The municipality of Gorgonzola is served by the line M2 of the Milan Metro with three stops: Villa Pompea (Piazza Marzabotto), Gorgonzola (Piazza Europa) and Cascina Antonietta (Via Sondrio).

==Cheese==
The city claims to have been the birthplace of its namesake cheese in 879, although other towns claim the origins. The area has a long history of breeding dairy cows and production of cheese, in particular soft cheese. In this regard, there are documents in the state of Milan that prove the presence of these cattle, sheep and cows, periodically surveyed and took the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, who, in one of her proclamations declared that the areas east of the state of Milan would continue in the cultivation of meadows for the breeding of dairy cows to be used in the production of cheese.

==Main sights==
The main city church is dedicated to Saints Gervasio and Protasio, and was completely rebuilt in the 19th century in the neoclassical style by Simone Cantoni for the Duke Serbelloni.
The sanctuary of Our Lady of Help, formerly dedicated to St. Peter, part of an ancient convent of the Humiliated, religious architecture is the city&#x27;s oldest. It was later dedicated to Our Lady of Help. The marble altar is from the 17th century, and there is a Via Crucis of valuable wood. In the past the church had an 18th-century pipe organ.

==Sport==
The main volleyball team is US Volleyball Argentia whose male team currently plays in Serie B2, while the ladies play in Serie C. The club has teams of all ages from Under 13 to Under 18, both for men and women.

The main football club is Giana Erminio, which in 2013 achieved its first promotion to Serie D, and was promoted for the first time to Serie C in 2014-2015. The home ground of Giana Erminio (as well as the main ground in the city) is the Municipal Stadium of the City of Gorgonzola. Another football club is POL Argentia, whose first team plays in the second category. Other sports clubs in Gorgonzola include Argentia New Basketball, Shotokan Karate Argentia, and ASD Gorgonzola Cycling. In the town there is also the Group Podistico Gorgonzola, which organises the races known as Running Gipigiata.

==Notable people==
* Luca Castellazzi, footballer of Turin
* Anacleto Cazzaniga, Archbishop of Urbino, former provost of Gorgonzola
* Camillo Ripamonti, senator and minister of the Republic

<doc id="349989" wikidata="Q3819170" url="?curid=349989" title="Andrew Molera State Park">
<text>Andrew Molera State Park is a , relatively undeveloped state park on the Big Sur coast of California, United States, preserving land as requested by former owner Frances Molera. Situated at the mouth of the Big Sur River, the property was part of the Rancho El Sur land grant, and later owned by Californio pioneer John Bautista Rogers Cooper and his descendants. Cooper&#x27;s grandchildren Andrew and Frances Molera inherited the property from their mother in 1918. Andrew popularized the artichoke in California in 1922, and died in 1931. In 1965, Frances sold the property to The Nature Conservancy, stipulating that the park to be created should be named for her brother.

== Activities ==
Activities at the park include hiking, fishing and beachcombing, with miles of trails winding through redwood groves, meadows, beaches, and hilltops. A primitive walk-in trail camp, popular with hikers and bikers, is located approximately one-third of a mile from the parking area. It is considered the most reliable surfing area in Big Sur.

The park is south of Carmel-by-the-Sea on State Route 1.

=== Features ===

Andrew Molera State Park features the historic Cooper Cabin, built in 1861 or 1862. It is the oldest structure in Big Sur. Fur trader John Bautista Rogers Cooper was Andrew Molera&#x27;s grandfather.

The house used by the ranch foreman has been preserved and is used as a museum. It includes displays of Big Sur&#x27;s Native American and pioneer history, artists&#x27; exhibits, and historical artifacts. The museum is normally open mid-day on weekends during the summer, and in the winter when volunteers are available. The museum is located about south of the parking lot. , the museum is closed for exhibit cleaning and updates.

The Ventana Wildlife Society has established a Discovery Center within the park. The Discovery Center includes exhibits on local wildlife, including the California condor, and a bird banding laboratory. Scientists and other laboratory employees give regular tours of Andrew Molera State Park, explaining the flora and fauna that are unique to the area.

The park also features a year-round waterfall, Highbridge Falls. Other nearby waterfalls include Limekiln Falls, Salmon Creek Falls, McWay Falls in Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, and Pfeiffer Falls in Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.

=== Recreation ===
Andrew Molera State Park has over of hiking trails. Some run along the shore, others along the Big Sur River, while still others climb to high ridges with views of the entire Big Sur coast.

The only camping available in the park is in a 24-site walk-in campground. Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis. The campground is particularly popular with European visitors. No dogs are allowed on the trails or campground.

=== Marine protected areas ===
Point Sur State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area are marine protected areas offshore from Andrew Molera State Park. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

== History ==

John Bautista Rogers Cooper traded Rancho Bolsa del Potrero y Moro Cojo in the northern Salinas Valley with Juan Bautista Alvarado for the Rancho El Sur where the state park is located today. When the Mexican government ceded California to the United States after the Mexican–American War, the Land Act of 1851 required grantees to provide proof of their title. Cooper filed a claim for Rancho El Sur with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and he received the legal land patent after years of litigation in 1866.

Cooper&#x27;s son John Bautista Henry Cooper built a home on the ranch in 1899, but died soon after. John B.H. Cooper&#x27;s sister Francisca Guadalupe Amelia Cooper inherited the southern two sections comprising of Rancho El Sur. When she died, her two children Andrew J. and Francisca (known as Frances) Molera inherited the land, although they lived their adult lives in San Francisco. The ranch became known as the Molera Ranch.

Andrew J. Molera owned property in the Castroville area, and encouraged farmers to grow artichokes in 1922. They became a major crop in the Salinas Valley. Molera, who was very obese, died of a sudden heart attack in 1931. His sister Frances became the sole owner of the family&#x27;s Big Sur property. She arranged in 1965, almost 100 years after her grandfather John B.R. Cooper had gained title, to sell (section four of the original Rancho El Sur) of the southern portion of the original Cooper land grant west of Highway 1 to The Nature Conservancy with the intent that it should become a state park. The conservancy held the shoreline property in trust until the state of California could finance the purchase of the land.

Frances Molera stipulated that the park should be named Andrew Molera State Park in honor of her brother. She also added provisions to the sale requiring that the land remain relatively undeveloped. She died in 1968. When the California state park administration began to propose considerable development for the park, the Nature Conservancy threatened to revoke the sale arrangement, and the state backed down. The remaining of Frances Molera&#x27;s half of the original Rancho El Sur east of Highway 1 was purchased by the state soon after her death. The northern 
of John. B.R. Cooper&#x27;s share of the Rancho El Sur comprising 13 parcels is the modern-day El Sur Ranch.

<doc id="349991" wikidata="Q3057310" url="?curid=349991" title="Ernie Pike">
<text>Ernie Pike is a comics series written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and originally drawn by Hugo Pratt, starring a World War II and Korean War reporter. It was first published in the magazine &quot;Hora Cero&quot; in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1957. The reporter, loosely based on the real reporter Ernie Pyle, acts as a narrator of stories, without being directly involved in them. Such stories do not narrate real battles or exploits of noteworthy military people, being instead tragic stories of unknown soldiers, made up by the author. Oesterheld worked again with the character during the time of the Vietnam War, and Ricardo Barreiro used it for a brief story about the Falklands War.

==Overview==
The comic is set during World War II, and the protagonist - Ernie Pike - is the narrator, without playing an active role in the stories. Unlike genre standards, the comic does not show any battles, and neither describes the war between Allies and Nazis as a conflict between good and evil. Instead, it centers on tragic events involving soldiers of both sides. Generally, those tragedies are misunderstandings that end up badly: characters who go mad, kill their own friends by friendly fire or because they believe them to be traitors, attempt to get killed in a specific way to avoid a more gruesome death, or who must mercy-kill badly hurt comrades, to cite several examples. Oesterheld, thus, utilizes war comics to reflect his personal dislike of war itself. The character never formulates positive or negative opinions about the Allies, the Nazis or specific events of the war, but about the morality of the soldiers in the anecdotes. The stories take place at various locations of World War II, such as the European Theatre, the South Pacific ocean, the North African Campaign and the Eastern Front.

There are no recurring characters besides Ernie Pike, and in many cases even his presence is small: he appears in just two panels in &quot;Kumba&quot;, only one in &quot;El amuleto&quot;, and in some stories he is completely absent. The character also evolves along the published issues from a war correspondent character acting in a first-person narrative to a narrator with an omniscient point-of-view, aware of stories and information beyond the capabilities of a real reporter.

==Creation==

The name of the protagonist was reminiscent of that of Ernie Pyle, a well known real life war correspondent of the era. Unlike Ernie Pyle, Ernie Pike survives the war and is referenced as a veteran in other stories by Pratt. The face of Ernie Pike resembles that of Oesterheld himself. This was caused by a misunderstanding during the period of designing of the character: when Oesterheld was describing to Pratt the positive traits of the new character, he ended saying &quot;Make him like me!&quot;. However, Pratt did not realize that Oesterheld was joking, and used his face. By the time Oesterheld realized the mistake, Pratt&#x27;s work was already advanced, so he let it stay that way.

Oesterheld was influenced by anti-war authors, such as Erich Maria Remarque, Stephen Crane or Leo Tolstoy; as well as by the career of the mentioned Ernie Pyle. Pratt also revealed that he stole more than four hundred of war photos from the staff of &quot;Il Gazzettino di Venezia&quot;, which were used by the artist as inspiration for the comic strip. Oesterheld was also influenced by those photos, and many stories were inspired by specific photos that led the author to develop a story about them.

==Publishing history==
The comic was first published in &quot;Hora Cero&quot; magazine, of the &quot;&quot;Frontera&quot; publishing company. After several years, Hugo Pratt left for Europe, while Oesterheld stayed in Argentina. Hugo Pratt republished Ernie Pike in Italy and other European countries under his sole name. Oesterheld continued the comic with other Argentine artists, like Alberto Breccia and Francisco Solano López, among others. The character was moved to other Frontera magazines, such as &quot;Hora Cero Extra&quot;, the weekly supplement of &quot;Hora Cero&quot;, or &quot;Colección batallas inolvidables&quot;&quot; (). This last one was created after the success of Ernie Pike, and was focused on war comics. The Ernie Pike run in Frontera is considered part of the golden age of Argentine comics. By the decade of 1960 most pencilers of Frontera were being hired by the British &quot;Fleetway&quot;, but Oesterheld kept using new pencilers such as José Muñoz. &quot;Frontera&quot; would eventually go into bankruptcy.

Oesterheld worked again with Ernie Pike in the 1970 decade, in the &quot;Top Maxi Historietas&quot;&quot; comic book published by Cielosur Editora. The approach was slightly changed in this new run: instead of World War II, the stories were about the ongoing Vietnam War. The stories kept the same style as before, but Pike was now involved with the events as they took place, thus becoming an active character of the stories instead of just the narrator. The stories were also more critical of the involvement of the US in the war, in line with the new politically radical views that Oesterheld was developing. Oesterheld would work later with many strips in the &quot;Skorpio&quot; comic book, but Ernie Pike would last only for a single story. This story, penciled by Solano López, worked again with World War II, but from a new angle: it was a story set in current times, about people having a dispute about things that took place during the war.

There was a brief recreation of the character by other authors during the Falklands War. Ricardo Barreiro wrote &quot;La batalla de las Malvinas&quot; (), penciled by Alberto Macagno, Carlos Pedrazzini, Marcelo Pérez and César Medrano. This story lasted for 7 issues of the magazine &quot;Fierro&quot;, ending inconclusively. Ernie Pike was included as a guest-star, placed in Patagonia as an aged war veteran, watching the events unfolding.

Several volumes of Ernie Pike by Oesterheld-Pratt - along others of Sergeant Kirk - were reprinted in 2006 for the &quot;Nueva Biblioteca Clarín de la Historieta&quot;&quot; collection published by Clarín newspaper. Previously, Ancares Editora had reprinted the volumes by Oesterheld-Breccia in 2002.

<text>Angel Island is an island in San Francisco Bay. The entire island is included within Angel Island State Park, administered by California State Parks. The island, a California Historical Landmark, has been used by humans for a variety of purposes, including seasonal hunting and gathering by Indigenous peoples, water and timber supply for European ships, ranching by Mexicans, United States military installations, a United States Public Health Service Quarantine Station, and a U.S. Bureau of Immigration inspection and detention facility. 

The Angel Island Immigration Station, on the northeast corner of the island, which has been designated a National Historic Landmark, is where officials detained, inspected, and examined approximately one million immigrants, who primarily came from Asia.

== Geography ==

Angel Island is the second largest island in area of the San Francisco Bay (Alameda is the largest). On a clear day, Sonoma and Napa can be seen from the north side of the island; San Jose can be seen from the south side of the island. The highest point on the island, almost exactly at its center, is Mount Caroline Livermore, more commonly known as simply Mt Livermore, at a height of . This peak is named for Caroline Sealy Livermore. The island is almost entirely in the city of Tiburon, in Marin County, although there is a small sliver (0.7%) at the eastern end of it (Fort McDowell) which extends into the territory of the City and County of San Francisco. The island is separated from the mainland of Marin County by Raccoon Strait, the depth of the water approximately . The United States Census Bureau reported a land area of and a population of 57 people as of the 2000 census.
== Geology ==

Angel Island emerged during the last Ice Age when the ocean, much lower and located miles to the west, shaped the landscape. The rocks of Angel Island are part of the Franciscan Complex, an extensive belt of marine sedimentary and igneous rocks which were deformed and metamorphosed during the Mesozoic Era. Metamorphism of the Franciscan Complex occurred at high pressures and low temperatures, producing indicator minerals jadeite and glaucophane, characteristic of subduction zone metamorphism. The rocks of Angel Island have been grouped with similar rocks displaying similar metamorphic minerals in the East Bay Hills and on the Tiburon Peninsula as the &quot;Angel Island Nappe&quot;. The island&#x27;s form is roughly, featuring steep ridges radiating from the central peak of the Mount Caroline Livermore. The rocks are diverse, including well-exposed serpentinite in the old quarry, sandstones and conglomerates containing clasts of glaucophane schist on Kayak Beach, meta-volcanics and cherts with dark blue amphibole and brown needles of stilpnomelane on Perles Beach. However, their relationships to one another are not well understood. The Franciscan Complex rocks are unconformably overlain by flat-lying sediments of the Colma Formation near Blunt Point on the south coast of the island. These sandstones are only weakly consolidated and are eroding to provide a supply of sand to the south coast of the island, in contrast to the northern and western beaches which are dominated by pebbles and cobbles. The shape of the hillslopes on Angel Island include the scars of prehistoric landslides and mass wasting, and deposits of eroded material may have been transported away from the island by currents in the San Francisco Bay.

== History ==
Until about 10,000 years ago, Angel Island was connected to the mainland; it was cut off by the rise in sea levels due to the end of the last ice age. From about 2,000 years ago, the island was a fishing and hunting site for Coast Miwok Native Americans. Similar evidence of Native American settlement is found on the nearby mainland of the Tiburon Peninsula upon Ring Mountain. In 1775, the Spanish naval vessel &quot;San Carlos&quot; made the first European entry to the San Francisco Bay under the command of Juan de Ayala. Ayala anchored off Angel Island, and gave it its modern name (&quot;&quot;); the bay where he anchored is now known as Ayala Cove.

In his book &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;, published in 1841, Richard Henry Dana Jr. mentions in chapter 26, that in 1834 his sailing ship collected wood from &quot;a small island, about two leagues from the Yerba Buena anchorage, called by us &#x27;Wood Island&#x27; and by the Mexicans &#x27;Isla de los Ángeles&#x27; and was covered with trees to the waters edge.&quot;

It is shown, labeled &quot;I. de los Angeles&quot;, on an 1850 survey map of the San Francisco Bay Area made by Cadwalader Ringgold and an 1854 map of the area by Henry Lange. Quarry operations began in the 1850s on the east side of the island near Quarry Point, with quarried stones used in the construction of a new fortress on Alcatraz Island, a new Navy shipyard on Mare Island, and a bank in San Francisco. In 1867, General McDowell took control of the quarry and used it for Army construction at Fort Point, the San Francisco Presidio, and on Angel Island itself.
Like much of the California coast, Angel Island was subsequently used for cattle ranching. In 1863, during the American Civil War, the U.S. Army was concerned about Confederate naval raiders attacking San Francisco. It decided to construct artillery batteries on Angel Island, first at Stuart (or Stewart) Point and then Point Knox. Col. René Edward De Russy was the Chief Engineer; James Terry Gardiner was the engineer tasked with designing and supervising the work. The Army established Fort Reynolds, which was garrisoned by Battery B, 3rd Artillery Regiment. The post was named by Second Lieutenant John L. Tiernon, commander of Battery B, in honor of John F. Reynolds, a Union Army general who had been killed at the Battle of Gettysburg. This portion of the island is now known as Camp Reynolds or the West Garrison, and it subsequently became an infantry garrison during the US campaigns against Native American peoples in the West.

===Fort McDowell===

In the later 19th century, the army designated the entire island as &quot;Fort McDowell&quot; and developed further facilities there, including what is now called the East Garrison or Fort McDowell. A quarantine station was opened in Ayala Cove (which at the time was known as Hospital Cove) in 1891. During the Spanish–American War the island served as a discharge depot for returning troops. It continued to serve as a transit station throughout the first half of the 20th century, with troops engaged in World War I embarking and returning there. During the war, the post was commanded by Colonel George K. McGunnegle, who reached the mandatory retirement age of 64 in 1918 but remained on duty until the end of the war. After the war, the disembarkation center was commanded by William P. Burnham, who had commanded the 82nd Division in France during the war.

On 6 May 1932 the Army created the San Francisco Port of Embarkation as a command which included the Overseas Replacement and Discharge Service at Fort McDowell, Fort Mason and the Pacific Army Transport Service ships and facilities.

In 1938, hearings concerning charges of membership in the Communist political party against labor leader Harry Bridges were held on Angel Island before Dean James Landis of Harvard Law School. After eleven weeks of testimony that filled nearly 8,500 pages, Landis found in favor of Bridges. The decision was accepted by the United States Department of Labor and Bridges was freed.

During World War II, the need for troops in the Pacific far exceeded prior needs. The facilities on Angel Island were expanded and further processing was done at Fort Mason in San Francisco. Prior to the war, the infrastructure had been expanded, including building the Army ferry , which transported troops to and from Angel Island on a regular schedule. Fort McDowell was used as a detention station for Japanese, German and Italian immigrant residents of Hawaii arrested as potential fifth columnists (despite a lack of supporting evidence or access to due process). These internees were later transferred to inland Department of Justice and Army camps. Japanese and German prisoners of war were also held on the island, supplanting immigration needs, which were curtailed during the war years.

After World War II ended, the reorganization of the San Francisco Port of Embarkation did not include Fort McDowell, and the post was decommissioned on August 28, 1946.

In 1954 a Nike missile station was installed on the island. The missile magazines were constructed above Point Blunt on the island&#x27;s southeast corner, and the top of Mount Ida (now Mount Caroline Livermore) was flattened to make way for a helipad and the associated radar and tracking station (IFC). The missiles were removed in 1962, when the military left the island. The missile launch pad still exists, but the station atop Mount Caroline Livermore was restored to its original contours in 2006.

=== Quarantine station ===

The bubonic plague posed such a threat to the U.S. that Angel Island opened as a quarantine station in 1891 to screen Asian passengers and their baggage prior to landing on U.S. soil. The construction of this federally funded quarantine station was completed in 1890 at a cost of approximately $99,000. The compound contained many separate buildings including detention barracks, disinfection facilities, convalescence quarters, and an isolation hospital that was known as the &quot;leper&#x27;s house&quot;. Even with the new construction, the facilities were lacking in cleanliness, staffing and adequate space.

In response to the death of Wong Chut King, a Chinese immigrant who worked in a rat-infested lumberyard in Chinatown, the San Francisco Health Board quickly quarantined the local area to neutralize possible disease-causing agents. Persons suspected of having any contact with this sickness were sent to isolation facilities. After more deaths, tissue samples were sent to Angel Island for testing to determine if they harbored Yersinia pestis, the bacteria responsible for spreading the bubonic plague. At this time, the plague was difficult to diagnose due to other diseases which could mask the presence of plague. The culture was tested on animals for four days, and &quot;Y. pestis&quot; was confirmed. Bacteriologist Joseph J. Kinyoun, who was stationed at Angel Island in 1899, believed that the plague would spread throughout San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown.

=== Immigration station ===

The construction of the Angel Island immigration station began in 1905 but was not used until 1910. This zone was known as China Cove. It was built for controlling Chinese entry into the United States. From 1910 to 1940, Angel Island served as an immigration station processing immigrants from 84 countries, mostly from China, Japan, Russia and South Asia (in that order). The purpose of the immigration station was to investigate Chinese who had been denied entry from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Immigrants had to prove that they had husbands or fathers who were U.S. citizens in order not to be deported.

The immigration station at Angel Island was predominantly used to inspect, disinfect, and detain Chinese, Japanese, and other Asian immigrants who sailed across the Pacific Ocean. In addition to standard medical examinations, Chinese immigrants were inspected for parasitic diseases, and the tests for intestinal parasites required a stool specimen. Immigrants described the examination and disinfection process as brutal, humiliating, and indecent. Passengers who were found to be sick were sent to the hospital in the immigration station until they could pass a medical examination and an immigration hearing. Investigation processes determined the length of time an immigrant would stay at the station and Chinese immigrants could be detained for a period as short as two weeks to as long as two years. A person&#x27;s racial identity and social class determined the intensity of the examination imposed, resulting in fewer white Europeans and American citizens being subjected to the inspections.

A fire destroyed the administration building in 1940, and subsequent immigration processing took place in San Francisco. On November fifth of 1940, the last gathering of around 200 immigrants, including around 150 Chinese, were exchanged from Angel Island to brief quarters in San Francisco.

In 1964, the Chinese American community successfully lobbied the State of California to designate the immigration station as a State Landmark. Today, the Angel Island Immigration Station is a federally designated National Historic Landmark. The detention barrack was renovated by the California State Parks, which reopened February 16, 2009. Docent tours for school groups can be made by appointment. After sitting vacant since World War II, the hospital near the detention barrack was renovated, at a cost of $15 million from a variety of federal, state and private sources, and opened as a museum in 2022.

==Angel Island State Park==


In 1955, the State Park Commission authorized California State Parks to purchase around Ayala Cove, marking the birth of Angel Island State Park. Additional acreage was purchased four years later, in 1959. The last federal Department of Defense personnel withdrew in 1962, turning over the entire island as a state park in December of the same year.

There is one active United States Coast Guard lighthouse on the island at Point Blunt. The lighthouse at Point Stuart has been disestablished.

===Ecology===
The island&#x27;s native plant communities include coastal grassland and coastal scrub, mostly on the island&#x27;s south- and west-facing slopes and ridge tops, and evergreen woodland – predominantly of Coast Live Oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;), bay (&quot;Umbellularia californica&quot;), toyon &quot;(Heteromeles arbutifolia)&quot;, and madrone (&quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot;), with California Hazelnut &quot;(Corylus cornuta)&quot; and Western Sword Fern &quot;(Polystichum munitum)&quot; in the understory – on the eastern and northern portions of the island sheltered from the westerly winds from the Golden Gate.

It is thought that the Coast Miwoks used regular fires to expand the grassland and shrublands at the expense of the woodlands. Commodities from continents worldwide have seamlessly merged into the environment through livestock transportation and Spanish missionaries&#x27; seed cultivation. The grasslands and shrublands provided edible seeds and bulbs, and supported larger numbers of deer and small game.

The Angel Island Mole, &quot;Scapanus latimanus insularis&quot;, is a subspecies of broad-footed mole endemic to Angel Island.

The military had planted 24 acres of Bluegum Eucalyptus (&quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot;) on the island for windbreaks, beautification, timber, and erosion control. By the mid-1980s, the area covered by eucalyptus had expanded to 86 acres. In the 1980s, California State Parks undertook environmental studies to remove most of the Eucalyptus from the island, in order to restore native flora and reduce fire danger. The proposal generated controversy and received much local media coverage, and was approved to begin in 1990. Eucalyptus were removed from 80 acres between 1990 and 1997, and nursery-grown native plants were planted in the cleared areas. Six acres of historically significant eucalyptus trees were retained.

As elsewhere in California, intensive cattle grazing in the 19th century allowed annual grasses introduced from Southern Europe to replace the native perennial grasses. Before European colonization, the Angel Island area maintained a diverse oak woodland ecosystem consisting of coast live oak, California Bay, and madrone. Additionally, grasslands and coastal scrub primarily covered shrubbery in the South and West portions. Ongoing removal of non-native plants, including French broom (&quot;Genista monspessulana&quot;), Italian thistle (&quot;Carduus pycnocephalus&quot;) and Ice plant (&quot;Carpobrotus edulis&quot;), continues in an effort to restore the original evergreen woodland, perennial grassland, and coastal scrub plant communities.

In addition to the eucalyptus, plantings from the military period of Monterey Pine (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;), Cork Oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;), Australian Blackwood &quot;(Acacia melanoxylon)&quot;, Canary Island Date Palm (&quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot;), Century Plant (&quot;Agave americana&quot;), Japanese Redwood (&quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot;), Incense Cedar (&quot;Calocedrus decurrens&quot;), Deodar Cedar (&quot;Cedrus deodara&quot;), Coast Redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;), Giant Sequoia (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;), Norfolk Island Pine &quot;(Araucaria heterophylla)&quot;, Monkey puzzle tree &quot;(Araucaria araucana)&quot; and others can be found in and around the former military bases and immigration station.

Mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;) were reintroduced to the island by the army in 1915 for hunting. In the absence of predators, the deer population expanded and overgrazed the island. The deer population is now managed annually by California State Parks and the Department of Fish and Game.

In 2002, the summit of Mount Caroline Livermore, which had been flattened in the 1950s to build the Nike missile radar and tracking installation, was re-contoured to resemble its original appearance, and increased 16 feet in height as a result. The access road up the west side of the mountain was removed, and replaced with a winding trail up the east side.

====2008 fire====
On October 12, 2008, at approximately 9 p.m. PDT, a fire visible from all around the San Francisco Bay broke out on the island and spread to an estimated within an hour. By 8 a.m. the next morning, the fire had scorched a third of the islandand was 20 percent contained.

Firefighters ran around from the mainland and helicopters dropped water and fire retardants to protect the historical buildings and extinguish the fire that was fully contained by October 14, 2008, at approximately 7 p.m. 380 of the island&#x27;s were burned in the fire. With the exception of one abandoned water tank, no structures were lost in the fire.

Firefighting efforts were coordinated from the USCGC &quot;Sockeye&quot;.

In portions of the evergreen woodlands, the fire burned through quickly, consuming the understory, but leaving the trees mostly undamaged. The fire burned several stands of Monterey Pine (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;) originally planted by the U.S. Army, which will be restored to native evergreen woodlands.

Prior fires include one in 2005 that burned , and a smaller 2–3-acre blaze in 2004.

===Access===

Access to the island is only by boat at Ayala Cove Ferry Terminal. There is ferry service to the island from San Francisco or from Tiburon. The Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry operates daily from Tiburon to the island. Golden Gate Ferry operates ferries to the San Francisco Ferry Building. During the off-season (October–March), all ferries run a reduced schedule. All ferry fares include park admission. Private boats can also access the island. The California State Park Annual Day Use Pass can be used to pay day use dock fees for private boats, but it is not accepted from visitors coming via the public ferries.

Bicycles can be brought on the ferry or rented seasonally on land and used on the island&#x27;s main roads. Electric scooters and Segways can also be rented. Due to the terrain, roller skates, roller blades, skateboards, kick scooters, and personal Segway scooters are prohibited.

Dogs (except service dogs) are not allowed.

Wood fires are prohibited. Charcoal fires are allowed, but charcoal is not available for purchase on the island.

There are 11 environmental campsites, including an ADA site, 9 numbered sites (each site accommodating up to 8 people), and a kayak-accessible group site (holds up to 20 people).

Night travel on the island is prohibited in some areas for reasons of park security and public safety.

Metal detectors, while allowed, are not recommended, because digging or disturbing the soil or ground in the park is prohibited.

=== Electrical infrastructure ===
Angel Island is served by PG&amp;E via two 12 kV undersea cables which cross Raccoon Strait from Tiburon. As of mid-2015, peak electrical load is approximately 100 kW. One cable is out of service and the other is deteriorating. Instead of replacing the cables, PG&amp;E is investigating using the island for a distributed energy resources microgrid pilot project.

<doc id="349998" wikidata="Q7287998" url="?curid=349998" title="Ralph Rapson">
<text>Ralph Rapson (September 13, 1914 – March 29, 2008) was Head of the School of Architecture at the University of Minnesota for 30 years. He was an interdisciplinary designer, one of the world&#x27;s oldest practicing architects at his death at age 93, and also one of the most prolific. His oldest son is the philanthropist Rip Rapson.

==Early life and education==

Rapson was born in Alma, Michigan with a deformed right arm that was amputated at birth; he learned to draw expertly with his left hand. He earned architecture degrees at the University of Michigan, and at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he studied under Eliel Saarinen. “Cranbrook was a very exciting, dynamic place where I met and worked with guys like Charlie Eames, Harry Bertoia, and Harry Weese,” Rapson said.

As a young architect, Rapson worked for the Saarinen architectural office from 1940 to 1941. He moved to Chicago in 1941, where he worked with George Fred Keck and others.

==Teaching==
Rapson taught architecture at the New Bauhaus School (now IIT Institute of Design) in Chicago under Laszlo Maholy-Nagy from 1942 to 1946, and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1946 to 1954.

He was Head of the School of Architecture at the University of Minnesota from 1954 to 1984, where &quot;generations of Minnesota architects came up through [his] tutelage&quot;.

==Architectural practice and philosophy==

While at Cranbrook, Rapson was part of a team with Eero Saarinen and Fred James which won the competition for a National Festival Theater on the campus of the College of William and Mary. This would possibly have been the first Modernist building on an American academic campus, but it went unbuilt amidst political opposition to the sponsoring organization, the American National Theater and Academy, spurred by the controversial productions of the independent but similar Federal Theater Project (also shuttered in 1939).

After accepting his position at the University of Minnesota, Rapson lead his own practice in Minneapolis from 1954 to 2008. His work was predominantly in the Modernist style and greatly influenced by his time at the New Bauhaus School. “Practically all the work I’ve done is not too far off from Bauhaus principles,” he said. However, he also stressed his work was oriented to people rather than abstract principles: “Whenever I’m designing a building or a piece of furniture, people become a strong part of my general approach. The design process isn’t just about bricks and stones; for me it’s also about the people in a building and how I expect them to live.”

Rapson was a prolific sketch artist and kept volumes of sketchbooks from his various world travels. A book of selected sketches was published in 2002. In the book&#x27;s introduction, Cesar Pelli described his drawings as &quot;completely self-assured&quot; and &quot;quintessentially American.&quot;

==Buildings and projects==
Some of Rapson&#x27;s most important projects include:
* 1945: Case Study House No. 4, or &quot;Greenbelt House&quot; (part of the Case Study House program)
** Esther McCoy famously wrote: &quot;Rapson’s rendering of the house showed a helicopter hovering over the flat roof, as if the owner was coming home to the suburbs from his day at the office. His wife is waving to him. Where is she? Hanging out diapers in the drying yard. Rapson’s money was on the wrong machine.&quot;
** The &quot;Greenbelt House&quot; was constructed in 1989 for an exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.
** In recent years Rapson&#x27;s firm developed a line of prefabricated modern houses called the Rapson Greenbelt, which grew out of a submission for the Dwell Home Design Invitational and are now available through a company called Wieler.
* 1945: &quot;Rapson Rapid Rocker&quot; for Knoll Furniture
* 1954: United States Embassy, Diplomatstaden, Stockholm, Sweden
* 1954: United States Embassy, Copenhagen, Denmark
* 1957: St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church, Edina, Minnesota
* 1959: Prince of Peace Lutheran Church for the Deaf, St. Paul, Minnesota (demolished 2007)
* 1962-73: Cedar Square West (now Riverside Plaza) housing complex, Minneapolis, Minnesota (a federally funded New-Town-in-Town)
* 1963: Pillsbury House in Wayzata, Minnesota (demolished 1997)
* 1963: Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis, Minnesota (demolished 2006)
*1964: State Capital Credit Union, Minneapolis, Minnesota (converted to Southeast Library in 1967)
* 1969: St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, St. Paul Park, Minnesota
* 1972: Rarig Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota

==Awards and honors==
* American Institute of Architects College of Fellows (FAIA)
* Gold Medal, Minnesota Society of Architects
* Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA) Distinguished Professor Award, 1984-85.
* AIA/ACSA Topaz Medallion, 1987
* Winner, Dwell magazine lounge chair design competition, 2007
*Neutra Medal for Professional Excellence: In recognition for his contributions to the Environmental Design Profession and in honor of Modernist architect Richard Neutra, 1984.

==Death and remembrances==
Rapson died quietly in his home in Minneapolis on March 29, 2008. He was working in his office the previous day. Six hundred people attended his memorial service at the new Guthrie Theater. He was described as a &quot;rock star&quot; in the field.

Thomas Fisher, Dean of the University of Minnesota&#x27;s College of Design at the time (and Dean of the School of Architecture until the College&#x27;s establishment ), said: “His passing ends an era in American architecture as well as in the history of the school, and he will be very much missed by the thousands of people he influenced.” Linda Mack remembered him as &quot;A gentleman of the old school [who] maintained his career, his dignity, his charm and his kindliness to the end. He left more than an architectural legacy.&quot; According to Kay Lockhart, &quot;Ralph loved being an architect, and he told me once, he &#x27;felt sorry for anyone who wasn&#x27;t an architect.&#x27; He infused us all with that same spirit.&quot; His was survived by his wife Mary and two sons, Richard &quot;Rip&quot; and Thomas &quot;Toby&quot;, and a daughter, Ren, from a previous marriage.

<text>Colón () is a city and seaport in Panama, beside the Caribbean Sea, lying near the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal. It is the capital of Panama&#x27;s Colón Province and has traditionally been known as Panama&#x27;s second city. Originally it was located entirely on Manzanillo Island, surrounded by Limon Bay, Manzanillo Bay, and the Folks River; however, since the disestablishment of the Panama Canal Zone, the city&#x27;s limits have been redefined to include Fort Gulick, a former U.S. Army base, as well as the former Panama Canal Zone towns of Cristobal, Margarita, and Coco Solo.

== History ==

The city was founded in 1850 as the Atlantic terminal of the Panama Railroad, then underwent construction to meet the demand during the California Gold Rush for a fast route to California. For a number of years early in its history, the sizable United States émigré community called the town Aspinwall after Panama Railroad promoter William Henry Aspinwall, while the city&#x27;s Hispanic community called it Colón in honor of Christopher Columbus. The city was founded on the western end of a treacherously marshy islet known as Manzanillo Island. As part of the construction of the Panama Railroad, the island was connected to the Panamanian mainland by a causeway and part of the island was drained to allow the erection of permanent buildings.

Much of the city was destroyed in the Burning of Colón during the Colombian Civil War of 1885 and again during a massive fire in 1915. The Great Colón Fire of April 13–14, 1940 destroyed one-third of the city.

The 1914 boundary treaty made Colón an exclave of the Republic of Panama entirely surrounded by the Panama Canal Zone. Under the 1936 Hull–Alfaro Treaty, the United States ceded the &quot;Colón Corridor&quot; from the Canal Zone; this was a strip under Panamanian jurisdiction just wide enough to build a road long connecting the city to the main eastern portion of the republic. During Panamanian nationalist unrest from the 1950s onwards, the U. S. military sometimes established checkpoints along the Colón Corridor, feeding the resentment that had led to the unrest.

===Fort De Lesseps===
Fort De Lesseps was a small U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps fort located at the northern tip of the city. It was named after the canal developer Ferdinand de Lesseps.

===From 1948 to 1989===
In 1948, the southeastern corner of Manzanillo Island was designated as the Colón Free Trade Zone. The Free Trade Zone has since been expanded through land reclamation on the Folks River and annexation of parts of France Field (now Enrique Adolfo Jiménez Airport) and Coco Solo.

Politically instigated riots in the 1960s destroyed the city&#x27;s municipal palace and signaled the start of the city&#x27;s decline, which was further accelerated by the military dictatorships of Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega from 1968 to 1987.

=== Since late 2014 ===
A massive restoration and reconstruction project, involving parks, avenues and historic buildings and monuments, began in late 2014 and uses the hashtags &quot;#RenovaciónColón&quot;, &quot;#CiudadDeColón&quot;, &quot;#RenovationColon (Renovation of Colón)&quot; and &quot;#CityOfColon&quot;. The First Baptist Church of Colón, Panama, is one of the buildings whose renovation has been completed.

== Climate ==
Like most of the Caribbean coast of Central America, Colón possesses an extremely wet tropical climate owing to the powerful, wet trade winds flowing onto high mountains throughout the year. Unlike most parts of this coast, however, February and March are sufficiently dry that Colón fits into the tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) category rather than a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) as found in most Caribbean coastal areas. Nonetheless, the June-to-December period, with an average monthly rainfall of around , is so wet that Colón rivals La Ceiba, Honduras as the wettest sizable city in Central America.

== Population ==
Colón&#x27;s population in 1900 was 3,001. It grew significantly with the building of the Panama Canal, becoming 31,203 by 1920. In 2000, the population was around 204,000.

With the city&#x27;s economic decline, many of its upper and middle-class residents left, reducing its ethnic diversity. European and American expatriate communities, as well as Panamanians of Greek, Italian, Jewish, Chinese and Indian/South Asian heritage, started moving to Panama City, to former Canal Zone towns, and overseas.

Today, sizable South Asian and Arab communities live in the remaining prosperous areas of the city, as well as in gated communities outside it. The majority of the city&#x27;s population is of West Indian or mixed mestizo ancestry.

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
The main setting of the novella &quot;Latarnik&quot; (&quot;The Lighthouse Keeper&quot;, 1881) by Polish author Henryk Sienkiewicz is the lighthouse in Aspinwall.

Colón is also the setting of Argentine writer César Aira’s short 2002 novel &quot;Varamo&quot;.

Juan Gabriel Vásquez&#x27;s &quot;The Secret History of Costaguana&quot; has many scenes set in late 19C and early 20C Colón.

Georges Simenon&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Aîné des Ferchaux&quot; has Colon as a location in the second part of the novel.

== Sports ==
Colón is home to Correcaminos Colon, 2016 Basketball Champion of Panama and member of the FIBA Americas League. The team plays its home games at the Arena Teófilo &quot;Panamá&quot; Al Brown.

== Transport ==
The city is served by the Panama Canal Railway and Enrique Adolfo Jiménez Airport.

<text>Colón () is a province of Panama. The capital is the city of Colón. It covers an area of 4,575.5 km2, and the population (in 2023) is 281,956.

==Overview==
This province has traditionally been focused on commerce (through the Colón Free Zone, Panama Canal, and its banking activities), but also has natural resources that are being developed as a tourist attraction, such as coral reefs and rainforests. During the Spanish colonial period, the Colon region of Panama was the center of trade, commerce, and overall economy for the Spanish. They imported many black African slaves to this area to work in Panama and to ship to other Spaniard colonies.

Most of the black population in Panama is centered in the Province of Colon. Panama has two distinct groups of black people. The first and earliest black people were those who came as slaves as early as the fifteenth century, through much of the nineteenth century. They are of mixed African and Spanish descent. This group is known as Cimarrones, Afro Colonials, Nativos, Playeros, Congos. These terms have proven crucial in establishing that these are the first and original black people of the Republic of Panama. Afro Colonials have held on to their culture and adopted Hispanic customs, traits, and cultures. They took and assumed Spanish names and surnames. They also developed the beginning of Panama&#x27;s black population and culture, in pure and mixed forms. They have been incorporated into Panamanian and Spanish-speaking society, as a result.

In the nineteenth century, beginning as early as the 1840s, black people from the Caribbean and West Indies immigrated to Panama to assist to build the Panama Railway and the Panama Canal. Later many black people from all over the Caribbean and West Indies, especially from Jamaica and Barbados, settled here between the years of 1880 and 1901 to build the Panama Canal. Many later settled in the Colon Province. This group of Caribbean and/or West Indian origin are called Afro Antillanos by the Hispanic Panamanians. They have assimilated to the Hispanic culture and Panama as well as holding on to aspects of their descent and culture. They have influenced the cuisine and music of Panama. Most importantly, their influence on music, especially from those of Jamaican descent who created Reggae en Español.

<text>Sima (, ) is a Chinese family name. It is one of the rare two-character Chinese family names; most Chinese family names consist of only a single character. It is an occupational surname, literally meaning &quot;control&quot; (sī) &quot;horses&quot; (mǎ), or &quot;horse officer&quot;. The family name originated from one of the offices of the Zhou dynasty. 

==History==
The Sima clan were said to be the descendants of the mythological figures Gaoyang and Chongli (Gaoyang&#x27;s son). They served as &quot;xiaguan&quot; (夏官; &quot;officers of summer&quot;) in the reigns of the mythical emperors Yao and Shun and through the Xia and Shang dynasties. During the Zhou dynasty, officials holding the appointment of &quot;xiaguan&quot; oversaw military affairs and were collectively known as &quot;xiaguan sima&quot;. Cheng-bo Xiufu (程伯休甫), a descendant of Chongli (Zhurong), helped King Xuan of the Zhou dynasty consolidate his rule over his kingdom. In return, the king awarded aristocratic status to Chengbo Xiufu&#x27;s clan. Chengbo Xiufu and his descendants adopted Sima as their family name.

In the late Zhou dynasty, the Sima clan migrated to the states of Wei, Zhao and Qin. The Sima family in Qin included Sima Cuo (司馬錯), a general who was the commander-in-chief of Qin&#x27;s conquest of Shu. Sima Jin (司马靳), Cuo&#x27;s grandson, was a deputy general who battled alongside Bai Qi during the Battle of Changping. Jin&#x27;s descendants served Qin and Han. Jin&#x27;s fifth-generation descendant was Sima Tan, a Han dynasty court astrologer, and his son was Sima Qian, the author of &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;.

In the late Qin dynasty, Sima Ang served as a general in the insurgent Zhao state and joined other rebel forces in overthrowing the Qin dynasty. After the fall of the Qin dynasty, Sima Ang declared himself the king of a separate state, Yin (殷), with its capital in Henei (河內; in present-day Henan).

In the early Han dynasty, Sima Ang&#x27;s kingdom became a commandery of the Han Empire and his descendants had lived there since.

Sima Yi, a descendant of Sima Ang, served as an official, military general and regent of the Cao Wei state in the Three Kingdoms period. His grandson, Sima Yan, usurped the throne from the last Cao Wei emperor and established the Jin dynasty. After the Jin dynasty ended, many members of the Sima clan changed their surname to avoid persecution.

<doc id="350020" wikidata="Q464242" url="?curid=350020" title="American Federation of Labor">
<text>The American Federation of Labor (A.F. of L.) was a national federation of labor unions in the United States that continues today as the AFL-CIO. It was founded in Columbus, Ohio, in 1886 by an alliance of craft unions eager to provide mutual support and disappointed in the Knights of Labor. Samuel Gompers was elected the full-time president at its founding convention and was re-elected every year except one until his death in 1924. He became the major spokesperson for the union movement.

The A.F. of L. was the largest union grouping, even after the creation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) by unions that were expelled by the A.F. of L. in 1935. The A.F. of L. was founded and dominated by craft unions, especially in the building trades. In the late 1930s, craft affiliates expanded by organizing on an industrial union basis to meet the challenge from the CIO. The A.F. of L. and the CIO competed bitterly in the late 1930s but then cooperated during World War II and afterward. In 1955, the two merged to create the AFL-CIO, which has comprised the longest lasting and most influential labor federation in the United States to this day.

==Organizational history==
===Origins===
The American Federation of Labor (A.F. of L.) was organized as an association of trade unions in 1886. The organization emerged from a dispute with the Knights of Labor (K of L) organization, in which the leadership of that organization solicited locals of various craft unions to withdraw from their International organizations and to affiliate with the K of L directly, an action which would have moved funds from the various unions to the K of L. The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions also merged into what would become the American Federation of Labor.

One of the organizations embroiled in this controversy was the Cigar Makers&#x27; International Union (CMIU), a group subject to competition from a dual union, a rival &quot;Progressive Cigarmakers&#x27; Union&quot;, organized by members suspended or expelled by the CMIU. The two cigar unions competed with one another in signing contracts with various cigar manufacturers, who were at this same time combining themselves into manufacturers&#x27; associations of their own in New York City, Detroit, Cincinnati, Chicago, and Milwaukee.

In January 1886, the Cigar Manufacturers&#x27; Association of New York City announced a 20 percent wage cut in factories around the city. The Cigar Makers&#x27; International Union refused to accept the cut and 6,000 of its members in 19 factories were locked out by the owners. A strike lasting four weeks ensued. Just when it appeared that the strike might be won, the New York District Assembly of the Knights of Labor leaped into the breach, offering to settle with the 19 factories at a lower wage scale than that proposed by the CMIU, so long as only the Progressive Cigarmakers&#x27; Union was employed.

The leadership of the CMIU was enraged and demanded that the New York District Assembly be investigated and punished by the national officials of the Knights of Labor. The committee of investigation was controlled by individuals friendly to the New York District Assembly, however, and the latter was exonerated. The American Federation of Labor was thus originally formed as an alliance of craft unions outside the Knights of Labor as a means of defending themselves against this and similar incursions.

On April 25, 1886, a circular letter was issued by Adolph Strasser of the Cigar Makers and P. J. McGuire of the Carpenters, addressed to all national trade unions and calling for their attendance of a conference in Philadelphia on May 18. The call stated that an element of the Knights of Labor was doing &quot;malicious work&quot; and causing &quot;incalculable mischief by arousing antagonisms and dissensions in the labor movement.&quot; The call was signed by Strasser and McGuire, along with representatives of the Granite Cutters, the Iron Molders, and the secretary of the Federation of Trades of North America, a forerunner of the A.F. of L. founded in 1881.

Forty-three invitations were mailed, which drew the attendance of 20 delegates and letters of approval from 12 other unions. At this preliminary gathering, held in Donaldson Hall on the corner of Broad and Filbert Streets, the K of L was charged with conspiring with anti-union bosses to provide labor at below going union rates and with making use of individuals who had crossed picket lines or defaulted on payment of union dues. The body authored a &quot;treaty&quot; to be presented to the forthcoming May 24, 1886, convention of the Knights of Labor, which demanded that the K of L cease attempting to organize members of International Unions into its own assemblies without permission of the unions involved and that K of L organizers violating this provision should suffer immediate suspension.

For its part, the Knights of Labor considered the demand for the parcelling of the labor movement into narrow craft-based fiefdoms to be anathema, a violation of the principle of solidarity of all workers across craft lines. Negotiations with the dissident craft unions were nipped in the bud by the governing General Assembly of the K of L, however, with the organization&#x27;s Grand Master Workman, Terence V. Powderly refusing to enter into serious discussions on the matter. The actions of the New York District Assembly of the K of L were upheld.

===Formation and early years===
Convinced that no accommodation with the leadership of the Knights of Labor was possible, the heads of the five labor organizations which issued the call for the April 1886 conference issued a new call for a convention to be held December 8, 1886, in Columbus, Ohio, in order to construct &quot;an American federation of alliance of all national and international trade unions.&quot; Forty-two delegates representing 13 national unions and various other local labor organizations responded to the call, agreeing to form themselves into an American Federation of Labor.

Revenue for the new organization was to be raised on the basis of a &quot;per-capita tax&quot; of its member organizations, set at the rate of one-half cent per member per month (i.e. six cents per year, equal to $ today). Governance of the organization was to be by annual conventions, with one delegate allocated for every 4,000 members of each affiliated union. The founding convention voted to make the President of the new federation a full-time official at a salary of $1,000 per year (equal to $ today), and Samuel Gompers of the Cigar Makers&#x27; International Union was elected to the position. Gompers would ultimately be re-elected to the position by annual conventions of the organization for every year save one until his death nearly four decades later.

Although the founding convention of the A.F. of L. had authorized the establishment of a publication for the new organization, Gompers made use of the existing labor press to generate support for the position of the craft unions against the Knights of Labor. Powerful opinion-makers of the American labor movement such as the Philadelphia &quot;Tocsin,&quot; &quot;Haverhill Labor,&quot; the &quot;Brooklyn Labor Press,&quot; and the &quot;Denver Labor Enquirer&quot; granted Gompers space in their pages, in which he made the case for the unions against the attacks of employers, &quot;all too often aided by the K of L.&quot;

Headway was made in the form of endorsement by various local labor bodies. Some assemblies of the K of L supported the Cigar Makers&#x27; position and departed the organization: in Baltimore, 30 locals left the organization, while the membership of the Knights in Chicago fell from 25,000 in 1886 to just 3,500 in 1887. Factional warfare broke out in the K of L, with Terence Powderly blaming the organization&#x27;s travails on &quot;radicals&quot; in its ranks, while those opposing Powderly called for an end to what they perceived as &quot;autocratic leadership&quot;.

In the face of the steady disintegration of its rival, the fledgling American Federation of Labor struggled to maintain itself, with the group showing very slow and incremental growth in its first years, only cracking the 250,000 member mark in 1892. The group from the outset concentrated upon the income and working conditions of its membership as its almost sole focus. The A.F. of L.&#x27;s founding convention declaring &quot;higher wages and a shorter workday&quot; to be &quot;preliminary steps toward great and accompanying improvements in the condition of the working people.&quot; Participation in partisan politics was avoided as inherently divisive, and the group&#x27;s constitution was structured to prevent the admission of political parties as affiliates.

This fundamentally conservative &quot;pure and simple&quot; approach limited the A.F. of L. to matters pertaining to working conditions and rates of pay, relegating political goals to its allies in the political sphere. The Federation favored pursuit of workers&#x27; immediate demands rather than challenging the property rights of owners, and took a pragmatic view of politics which favored tactical support for particular politicians over formation of a party devoted to workers&#x27; interests. The A.F. of L.&#x27;s leadership believed the expansion of the capitalist system was seen as the path to betterment of labor, an orientation making it possible for the A.F. of L. to present itself as what one historian has called &quot;the conservative alternative to working class radicalism&quot;.

===Early 20th century===
The A.F. of L. faced its first major reversal when employers launched an open shop movement in 1903, designed to drive unions out of construction, mining, longshore and other industries. Membership in the A.F. of L.&#x27;s affiliated unions declined between 1904 and 1914 in the face of this concerted anti-union drive, which made effective use of legal injunctions against strikes, court rulings given force when backed with the armed might of the state.
At its November 1907 Convention in Norfolk, Virginia, the A.F. of L. founded the future North America&#x27;s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) as its Department of Building Trades.

Ever the pragmatist, Gompers argued that labor should &quot;reward its friends and punish its enemies&quot; in both major parties. However, in the 1900s (decade), the two parties began to realign, with the main faction of the Republican Party coming to identify with the interests of banks and manufacturers, while a substantial portion of the rival Democratic Party took a more labor-friendly position. While not precluding its members from belonging to the Socialist Party or working with its members, the A.F. of L. traditionally refused to pursue the tactic of independent political action by the workers in the form of the existing Socialist Party or the establishment of a new labor party. After 1908, the organization&#x27;s tie to the Democratic party grew increasingly strong.

====National Civic Federation====
Some unions within the A.F. of L. helped form and participated in the National Civic Federation. The National Civic Federation was formed by several progressive employers who sought to avoid labor disputes by fostering collective bargaining and &quot;responsible&quot; unionism. Labor&#x27;s participation in this federation, at first tentative, created internal division within the A.F. of L. Socialists, who believed the only way to help workers was to remove large industry from private ownership, denounced labor&#x27;s efforts at cooperation with the capitalists in the National Civic Federation. The A.F. of L. nonetheless continued its association with the group, which declined in importance as the decade of the 1910s drew to a close.

====Canada====
By the 1890s, Gompers was planning an international federation of labor, starting with the expansion of A.F. of L. affiliates in Canada, especially Ontario. He helped the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress with money and organizers, and by 1902, the A.F. of L. came to dominate the Canadian union movement.

====Immigration restriction====
The A.F. of L. vigorously opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe for moral, cultural, and racial reasons. The issue unified the workers who feared that an influx of new workers would flood the labor market and lower wages. Nativism was not a factor because upwards of half the union members were themselves immigrants or the sons of immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Britain. Nativism was a factor when the A.F. of L. even more strenuously opposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its Euro-American members) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society. The A.F. of L. intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing immigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 Emergency Quota Act and the Immigration Act of 1924, and seeing that they were strictly enforced.

Mink (1986) concludes that the link between the A.F. of L. and the Democratic Party rested in part on immigration issues, noting the large corporations, which supported the Republicans, wanted more immigration to augment their labor force.

Prohibition gained strength as the German American community came under fire. The A.F. of L. was against prohibition as it was viewed as cultural right of the working class to drink.

====Coalition against child labor====
Child labor was an issue on which the A.F. of L. found common ground with middle class reformers who otherwise kept their distance. The A.F. of L. joined campaigns at the state and national level to limit the employment of children under age 14. In 1904 a major national organization emerged, the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC). In state after state reformers launched crusades to pass laws restricting child labor, with the ultimate goals of rescuing young bodies and increasing school attendance. The frustrations included the Supreme Court striking down two national laws as unconstitutional, and weak enforcement of state laws due to the political influence of employers.

===World War I and after: 1917–1921===
The A.F. of L. and its affiliates were strong supporters of the war effort. The risk of disruptions to war production by labor radicals provided the A.F. of L. political leverage to gain recognition and mediation of labor disputes, often in favor of improvements for workers. The A.F. of L. unions avoided strikes in favor of arbitration. Wages soared as near-full employment was reached at the height of the war. The A.F. of L. unions strongly encouraged young men to enlist in the military, and fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by pacifists, the anti-war Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the radical faction of Socialists. To keep factories running smoothly, President Wilson established the National War Labor Board in 1918, which forced management to negotiate with existing unions. Wilson also appointed A.F. of L. president Gompers to the powerful Council of National Defense, where he set up the War Committee on Labor.

The A. F. of L. was strongly committed to the national war aims and cooperated closely with Washington. It used the opportunity to grow rapidly. It worked out an informal agreement with the United States government, in which the A.F. of L. would coordinate with the government both to support the war effort and to join &quot;into an alliance to crush radical labor groups&quot; that opposed the war effort, especially the Industrial Workers of the World and Socialist Party of America.

Gompers chaired the wartime Labor Advisory Board. He attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 as an official advisor on labor issues. 

In 1920, the A.F. of L. petitioned Washington for the release of prisoners who had been convicted under Wartime Emergency Laws. Wilson did not act but President Warren Harding did so. 

1919--the first year of peace--was one of turmoil in the labor movement. A.F. of L. membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917 and 4.1 million at the end of 1919. The A.F. of L. unions tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat, steel and other industries. The strikes ultimately failed. Many African Americans had taken war jobs; other became strikebreakers in 1919. Racial tensions were high, with major race riots. The economy was very prosperous during the war but entered a postwar recession. In general, workers lost out and the A.F. of L. lost influence.

===1920s===
In the pro-business environment of the 1920s, business launched a large-scale offensive on behalf of the so-called &quot;open shop&quot;, which meant that a person did not have to be a union member to be hired. A.F. of L. unions lost membership steadily until 1933. In 1924, following the death of Samuel Gompers, UMWA member and A.F. of L. vice president William Green became the president of the labor federation.

The organization endorsed pro-labor progressive Robert M. La Follette in the 1924 presidential election. He only carried his home state of Wisconsin. The campaign failed to establish a permanent independent party closely connected to the labor movement, however, and thereafter the Federation embraced ever more closely the Democratic Party, despite the fact that many union leaders remained Republicans. Herbert Hoover in 1928 won the votes of many Protestant A.F. of L. members.

===New Deal===

The Great Depression were hard times for the unions, and membership fell sharply across the country. As the national economy began to recover in 1933, so did union membership. The New Deal of president Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, strongly favored labor unions. He made sure that relief operations like the Civilian Conservation Corps did not include a training component that would produce skilled workers who would compete with union members in a still glutted market. The major legislation was the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, called the Wagner Act. It greatly strengthened organized unions, especially by weakening the company unions that many workers belonged to. It was to the members advantage to transform a company union into a local of an A.F. of L. union, and thousands did so, dramatically boosting the membership. The Wagner Act also set up to the National Labor Relations Board, which used its powers to rule in favor of unions and against the companies.

In the early 1930s, A.F. of L. president William Green (president, 1924–1952) experimented with an industrial approach to organizing in the automobile and steel industries. The A.F. of L. made forays into industrial unionism by chartering federal labor unions, which would organize across an industry and be chartered by the Federation, not through existing craft unions, guilds, or brotherhoods. As early as 1923, the A.F. of L. had chartered federal labor unions, including six news writer locals that had formerly been part of the International Typographical Union. However, in the 1930s the A.F. of L. began chartering these federal labor unions as an industrial organizing strategy. The dues in these federal labor unions (FLUs) were kept intentionally low to make them more accessible to low paid industrial workers; however, these low dues later allowed the Internationals in the Federation to deny members of FLUs voting membership at conventions. In 1933, Green sent William Collins to Detroit to organize automobile workers into a federal labor union. That same year workers at the Westinghouse plant in East Springfield MA, members of federal labor union 18476, struck for recognition. In 1933, the A.F. of L. received 1,205 applications for charters for federal labor unions, 1006 of which were granted. By 1934, the A.F. of L. had successfully organized 32,500 autoworkers using the federal labor union model. Most of the leadership of the craft union internationals that made up the federation, advocated for the FLU&#x27;s to be absorbed into existing craft union internationals and for these internationals to have supremacy of jurisdiction. At the 1933 A.F. of L. convention in Washington, DC, John Frey of the Molders and Metal Trades pushed for craft union internationals to have jurisdictional supremacy over the FLU&#x27;s; the Carpenters headed by William Hutchenson and the IBEW also pushed for FLU&#x27;s to turn over their members to the authority of the craft internationals between 1933 and 1935. In 1934, one hundred FLUs met separately and demanded that the A.F. of L. continue to issue charters to unions organizing on an industrial basis independent of the existing craft union internationals. In 1935 the FLUs representing autoworkers and rubber workers both held conventions independent of the craft union internationals.

By the 1935 A.F. of L. convention, Green and the advocates of traditional craft unionism faced increasing dissension led by John L. Lewis of the coal miners, Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated, David Dubinsky of the Garment Workers, Charles Howard of the ITU, Thomas McMahon of the Textile Workers, and Max Zaritsky of the Hat, Cap, and Millinery Workers, in addition to the members of the FLU&#x27;s themselves. Lewis argued that the A.F.of L. was too heavily oriented toward traditional craftsmen, and was overlooking the opportunity to organize millions of semiskilled workers, especially those in industrial factories that made automobiles, rubber, glass and steel. In 1935 Lewis led the dissenting unions in forming a new Congress for Industrial Organization (CIO) within the A.F. of L. Both the new CIO industrial unions, and the older A.F. of L. crafts unions grew rapidly after 1935. President Franklin D. Roosevelt became a hero to them. He won reelection in a landslide in 1936, and by a closer margin in 1940. Labor unions gave strong support in 1940, compared to very strong support in 1936. The Gallup Poll showed CIO voters declined from 85% in 1935 to 79% in 1940. A.F. of L. voters went from 80% to 71%. Other union members went from 74% to 57%. Blue collar workers who were not union members went 72% to 64%.

===World War II and merger===
The A.F. of L. retained close ties to the Democratic machines in big cities through the 1940s. Its membership surged during the war and it held on to most of its new members after wartime legal support for labor was removed. Despite its close connections to many in Congress, the A.F. of L. was not able to block the Taft–Hartley Act in 1947. Also in 1947, the union supported the strike efforts of thousands of switchboard operators by donating thousands of dollars.

In 1955, the A.F. of L. and CIO merged to form the AFL-CIO, headed by George Meany.

==Historical problems==
===Racism===

During its first years, the A.F. of L. admitted nearly anyone. Gompers opened the A.F. of L. to radical and socialist workers and to some semiskilled and unskilled workers. Women, African Americans, and immigrants joined in small numbers. By the 1890s, the Federation had begun to organize only skilled workers in craft unions and became an organization of mostly white men. Although the A.F. of L. preached a policy of egalitarianism in regard to African-American workers, it actively discriminated against them. The A.F. of L. sanctioned the maintenance of segregated locals within its affiliates, particularly in the construction and railroad industries, a practice that often excluded black workers altogether from union membership and thus from employment in organized industries.

In 1901, the A.F. of L. lobbied Congress to reauthorize the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, and issued a pamphlet entitled &quot;Some reasons for Chinese Exclusion. Meat vs. Rice. American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism. Which shall survive?&quot;. The A.F. of L. also began one of the first organized labor boycotts when they began putting white stickers on the cigars made by unionized white cigar rollers while simultaneously discouraging consumers from purchasing cigars rolled by Chinese workers.

===Sexism===
In most ways, the A.F. of L.&#x27;s treatment of women workers paralleled its policy towards black workers. The A.F. of L. never adopted a strict policy of gender exclusion and, at times, even came out in favor of women&#x27;s unionism. However, despite such rhetoric, it only half-heartedly supported women&#x27;s attempts to organize and, more often, took pains to keep women out of unions and the workforce altogether. Only two national unions affiliated with the A.F. of L. at its founding openly included women, and others passed bylaws barring women&#x27;s membership entirely. The A.F. of L. hired its first female organizer, Mary Kenney O&#x27;Sullivan, only in 1892, released her after five months, and it did not replace her or hire another woman national organizer until 1908. Women who organized their own unions were often turned down in bids to join the Federation, and even women who did join unions found them hostile or intentionally inaccessible. Unions often held meetings at night or in bars when women might find it difficult to attend and where they might feel uncomfortable, and male unionists heckled women who tried to speak at meetings.

Generally, the A.F. of L. viewed women workers as competition, strikebreakers, or an unskilled labor reserve that kept wages low. As such, it often opposed women&#x27;s employment entirely. When it organized women workers, it most often did so to protect men&#x27;s jobs and earning power, not to improve the conditions, lives, or wages of women workers. In response, most women workers remained outside the labor movement. In 1900, only 3.3% of working women were organized into unions. In 1910, even as the A.F. of L. surged forward in membership, that number had dipped to 1.5%. It improved to 6.6% over the next decade, but women remained mostly outside of unions and practically invisible inside of them into the mid-1920s.

Attitudes gradually changed within the A.F. of L. by the pressure of organized female workers. Female-domination began to emerge in the first two decades of the 20th century, including particularly the International Ladies Garment Workers&#x27; Union. Women organized independent locals among New York hat makers, in the Chicago stockyards, and among Jewish and Italian waist makers, to name only three examples. Through the efforts of middle-class reformers and activists, often of the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League, those unions joined the A.F. of L.

===Conflicts between affiliated unions===
From the beginning, unions affiliated with the A.F. of L. found themselves in conflict when both unions claimed jurisdiction over the same groups of workers: both the Brewers and Teamsters claimed to represent beer truck drivers, both the Machinists and the International Typographical Union claimed to represent certain printroom employees, and the Machinists and a fledgling union known as the &quot;Carriage, Wagon and Automobile Workers Union&quot; sought to organize the same employees even though neither union had made any effort to organize or bargain for those employees. In some cases, the A.F. of L. mediated the dispute, usually by favoring the larger or more influential union. The A.F. of L. often reversed its jurisdictional rulings over time, as the continuing jurisdictional battles between the Brewers and the Teamsters showed.

Affiliates within the AFL formed &quot;departments&quot; to help resolve these jurisdictional conflicts and to provide a more effective voice for member unions in given industries. The Metal Trades Department engaged in some organizing of its own, primarily in shipbuilding, where unions such as the Pipefitters, Machinists and Iron Workers joined through local metal workers&#x27; councils to represent a diverse group of workers. The Railway Employes&#x27; Department dealt with both jurisdictional disputes between affiliates and pursued a common legislative agenda for all of them.

==Historical achievements==
===Organizing and coordination===
The A.F. of L. made efforts in its early years to assist its affiliates in organizing: it advanced funds or provided organizers or, in some cases, such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Teamsters and the American Federation of Musicians, helped form the union. The A.F. of L. also used its influence, including refusal of charters or expulsion, to heal splits within affiliated unions, to force separate unions seeking to represent the same or closely related jurisdictions to merge, or to mediate disputes between rival factions where both sides claimed to represent the leadership of an affiliated union. The A.F. of L. also chartered &quot;federal unions&quot;, local unions not affiliated with any international union, in those fields in which no affiliate claimed jurisdiction.

The A.F. of L. also encouraged the formation of local labor bodies, known as central labor councils, in major metropolitan areas in which all of the affiliates could participate. Those local labor councils acquired a great deal of influence in some cases. For example, the Chicago Federation of Labor spearheaded efforts to organize packinghouse and steel workers during and immediately after World War I. Local building trades councils also became powerful in some areas. In San Francisco, the local Building Trades Council, led by Carpenters official P. H. McCarthy, not only dominated the local labor council but helped elect McCarthy mayor of San Francisco in 1909. In a very few cases early in the A.F. of L.&#x27;s history, state and local bodies defied A.F. of L. policy or chose to disaffiliate over policy disputes.

===Political action===
Though Gompers had contact with socialists and such as A.F. of L. co-founder Peter J. McGuire, the A.F. of L. adopted a philosophy of &quot;business unionism&quot; that emphasized unions&#x27; contribution to businesses&#x27; profits and national economic growth. The business unionist approach also focused on skilled workers&#x27; immediate job-related interests, while refusing to &quot;rush to the support of any one of the numerous society-saving or society destroying schemes&quot; involved in larger political issues.
This approach was set by Gompers, who was influenced by a fellow cigar maker (and former socialist) Ferdinand Laurrel. Despite his socialist contacts, Gompers himself was not a socialist.
Employers discovered the efficacy of labor injunctions, first used with great effect by the Cleveland administration during the Pullman Strike in 1894. While the A.F. of L. sought to outlaw &quot;yellow dog contracts&quot;, to limit the courts&#x27; power to impose &quot;government by injunction&quot; and to obtain exemption from the antitrust laws that were being used to criminalize labor organizing, the courts reversed what few legislative successes the labor movement won.

The A.F. of L. concentrated its political efforts during the last decades of the Gompers administration on securing freedom from state control of unions—in particular an end to the court&#x27;s use of labor injunctions to block the right to organize or strike and the application of the anti-trust laws to criminalize labor&#x27;s use of pickets, boycotts and strikes. The A.F. of L. thought that it had achieved the latter with the passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914—which Gompers referred to as &quot;Labor&#x27;s Magna Carta&quot;. But in &quot;Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering&quot;, 254 U.S. 443 (1921), the United States Supreme Court narrowly read the Act and codified the federal courts&#x27; existing power to issue injunctions rather than limit it. The court read the phrase &quot;between an employer and employees&quot; (contained in the first paragraph of the Act) to refer only to cases involving an employer and its own employees, leaving the courts free to punish unions for engaging in sympathy strikes or secondary boycotts.

The A.F. of L.&#x27;s pessimistic attitude towards politics did not, on the other hand, prevent affiliated unions from pursuing their own agendas. Construction unions supported legislation that governed entry of contractors into the industry and protected workers&#x27; rights to pay, rail and mass production industries sought workplace safety legislation, and unions generally agitated for the passage of workers&#x27; compensation statutes.

At the same time, the A.F. of L. took efforts on behalf of women in supporting protective legislation. It advocated fewer hours for women workers, and based its arguments on assumptions of female weakness. Like efforts to unionize, most support for protective legislation for women came out of a desire to protect men&#x27;s jobs. If women&#x27;s hours could be limited, reasoned A.F. of L. officials, they would infringe less on male employment and earning potential. But the A.F. of L. also took more selfless efforts. Even from the 1890s, the A.F. of L. declared itself vigorously in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage. It often printed pro-suffrage articles in its periodical, and in 1918, it supported the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage.

The A.F. of L. relaxed its rigid stand against legislation after the death of Gompers. Even so, it remained cautious. Its proposals for unemployment benefits (made in the late 1920s) were too modest to have practical value, as the Great Depression soon showed. The impetus for the major federal labor laws of the 1930s came from the New Deal. The enormous growth in union membership came after Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933 and National Labor Relations Act in 1935. The A.F. of L. refused to sanction or participate in the mass strikes led by John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers and other left unions such as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. After the A.F. of L. expelled the CIO in 1936, the CIO undertook a major organizing effort. In 1947, when the Taft-Hartley Act was passed, political activities were stirred. In resistance to the new law, the CIO joined the A.F. of L., and political co-operation set the path for union unity. The two groups merged, eight years later, into the AFL–CIO coalition with George Meany as the new president.

<doc id="350029" wikidata="Q3283805" url="?curid=350029" title="The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan">
<text>The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan (sometimes abbreviated as The Amazing Chan Clan) is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, animated by Eric Porter Studios in Australia and broadcast on CBS from September 9, 1972, to December 30, 1972, with reruns continuing through the summer of 1973 and in syndication from 1976 to 1982. The show was loosely based on the Charlie Chan series of mystery novels and films, which began with the 1925 novel &quot;The House Without a Key&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Throughout the series, legendary Chinese sleuth Charlie Chan is both impeded and assisted by his brood of ten children and their dog Chu Chu, in the process of solving mysteries and catching wily master criminals.

The family travels around the world in the Chan Van, a vehicle built by teenage genius Alan Chan, which can transform itself with the push of a button. While solving mysteries, the Chan kids break off into small groups with Henry and Stanley, the two oldest children, being paired together and driving the Chan Van. To ostensibly aid in their detective work, Stanley usually changes into some sort of goofy disguise much to the chagrin of his older brother Henry. As in many other Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the period, the kids also have their own music group, the Chan Clan, and they perform a song in each episode.

==Voice cast==
As the voice of the title character, Keye Luke is (to date) the only actor of Chinese ancestry to play the part in any screen adaptation. Luke had previously portrayed &quot;Number One Son&quot; Lee Chan opposite Warner Oland whose characterization had a relatively limited vocabulary in the long-running Charlie Chan film series of the 1930s and 1940s by 20th Century Fox and later, Monogram Pictures.

Early on, it was decided that most of the children&#x27;s accents were too thick for American audiences to understand, and all of the characters except Henry and Alan were recast. Once the new cast was in place, earlier episodes were re-dubbed.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
The program was sharply criticized by Katheryn Fong, Community Coordinator of the Chinese Media Committee of Chinese for Affirmative Action, an advocacy group based in San Francisco, for continuing &quot;to isolate generations of Chinese-Americans as being &#x27;different and keeping the same &quot;detective intoning stilted, fortune-cookie English spoken in proverbs&quot;. CBS President Robert D. Wood responded by calling the show &quot;a lighthearted escapist program for youngsters&quot;, emphasizing the stereotypical Asian-American tropes of filial piety and intelligence as positive contributions with the hope &quot;that CBS&#x27; &quot;Chan&quot; might begin to replace some of the abrasive imagery created by the old Charlie Chan character&quot;. Fong called this attitude a &quot;great tragedy ... convincing many people that this kowtowing caricature is acceptable&quot; and drew an analogy with a hypothetical cartoon about Adolf Hitler: &quot;If CBS did a cartoon called &#x27;Hitler&#x27;s Haus&#x27; along the same lines of &#x27;respect&#x27; and German pragmatism as your interpretation of Chan&#x27;s wisdom, would that begin to replace some of the abrasive imagery created by the old Hitler and make him more acceptable to Jews?&quot; Fong went on to sue the Federal Communications Commission in January 1973.

==Production==
===Music===
Don Kirshner produced the songs for the show as he did for &quot;The Monkees&quot; and &quot;The Archie Show&quot;. Singer Ron Dante supplies the singing voice of Stanley as he did for Archie on &quot;The Archie Show&quot;.

==Marketing and other media==
A board game, jigsaw puzzle, lunch box with thermos, and comic book series were released as licensed merchandise alongside the animated series.

===Comic book===

At about the same time that the show came out, Gold Key Comics produced a comic book series based on the program, with artwork by Warren Tufts; it only lasted four issues. The first issue (an adaptation of the first episode) was written by Mark Evanier and was his first comic book printed in English.

===Home media===
On June 19, 2012, Warner Archive released &quot;The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection. This is a manufacture-on-demand (MOD) release, available through Warner&#x27;s online store and Amazon.com.

===Other media appearances===
* The Chans appear in an episode of &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, as a Japanese band called &quot;Shoyu Weenie&quot;, with Mr. Chan as their semi-tyrannical band manager, who sued another band (&quot;The Neptunes&quot; from the &quot;Jabberjaw&quot; animated series) for plagiarism. Shoyu Weenie only spoke Japanese, although the original characters are Chinese.
* In episodes from &quot;Krypto the Superdog&quot; including &quot;Up, Up, and Away!&quot;, Mimi Chan is in Kevin&#x27;s class on the field trip to LexCorp.
* A high school student resembling Suzie Chan appears in three season 1 episodes of &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;.

<doc id="350044" wikidata="Q741123" url="?curid=350044" title="Chateau Marmont">
<text>The Chateau Marmont is a hotel located at 8221 Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. The hotel was designed by architects Arnold A. Weitzman and William Douglas Lee and completed in 1929. It was modeled loosely after the Château d&#x27;Amboise, a royal retreat in France&#x27;s Loire Valley.

The hotel is known as both a long- and short-term residence for celebrities – historically &quot;populated by people either on their way up or on their way down&quot; – as well as a home for New Yorkers in Hollywood. The hotel has 63 rooms, suites, cottages, and bungalows.

In 2020, the hotel announced plans to become a members-only hotel. These plans were withdrawn in 2022.

== History ==

=== Design and construction ===
In 1926, Fred Horowitz, a prominent Los Angeles attorney, chose the site at Marmont Lane and Sunset Boulevard to construct an apartment building. Horowitz had recently traveled to Europe for inspiration and returned to California with photos of a Gothic Chateau (Chateau d&#x27;Amboise where Leonardo da Vinci is buried) located along the Loire River. In 1927, Horowitz commissioned his brother-in-law, European-trained architect Arnold A. Weitzman, to design the seven-story, L-shaped building based on his photos from France. When deciding upon a name for the building, Chateau Sunset and Chateau Hollywood were rejected in favor of Chateau Marmont, after the small street running in front of the property.

On February 1, 1929, Chateau Marmont opened its doors to the public as the newest residence of Hollywood. Local newspapers described the Chateau as &quot;Los Angeles&#x27;s newest, finest and most exclusive apartment house […] superbly situated, close enough to active businesses to be accessible and far enough away to ensure quiet and privacy.&quot; For the inaugural reception, over 300 people passed through the site, including local press.

=== Conversion to hotel ===
Due to the high rents and inability to keep tenants for long-term commitments during the Great Depression, Horowitz sold the apartment building in 1931 to Albert E. Smith, co-founder of Vitagraph Studios, for $750,000 in cash (). Smith converted the building into a hotel, an investment which benefitted from the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The apartments became suites with kitchens and living rooms. The property was also refurbished with antiques from Depression-era estate sales. During the 1930s, the hotel was managed by former silent film actress Ann Little.

During World War II, the hotel served as an air-raid shelter for residents in the surrounding area. From about 1942 to 1963 the Chateau was owned by Erwin Brettauer, a German banker who had funded films in Weimar Germany, and was noted for allowing Black guests, breaking the long-standing color line in Hollywood and Beverly Hills hotels.

Designed and constructed to be earthquake-proof, Chateau Marmont survived major earthquakes in 1933, 1952, 1971, 1987, and 1994 without sustaining any major structural damage. Nine Spanish cottages, as well as a swimming pool, were built next to the hotel in the 1930s and were acquired by the hotel in the 1940s. Craig Ellwood designed two of the four bungalows in 1956, after he completed Case Study Houses.

=== Acquisition by Sarlot-Kantarjian ===
Business was good for the hotel, although by the 1960s, the building was in disrepair, and the owners attempted to sell it multiple times. News articles about the hotel from the 1960s and 1970s described it as an &quot;elderly castle&quot;, a &quot;dowdy hotel&quot;, &quot;rundown&quot;, and &quot;shabby-genteel&quot;.
After sitting on the market for two years, the hotel was sold in 1975 to Raymond R. Sarlot and Karl Kantarjian of Sarlot-Kantarjian, a real estate development firm, for $1.1 million. Sarlot-Kantarjian planned to expand the hotel with a new wing. They repaired and upgraded many elements of the hotel, but tried to stay true to the hotel&#x27;s character and history. In 1976, after their acquisition and improvements began, the Chateau was named a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writer Quentin Crisp praised the Chateau&#x27;s &quot;avoiding undue modernization and stayed deliberately in the romantic past.&quot;

=== Restoration and operation under Balazs ===
The hotel was acquired in 1990 by André Balazs. Balazs needed to modernize the hotel while also preserving Chateau Marmont&#x27;s character. For the restoration, Balazs strove to create the illusion that the hotel had been untouched, notwithstanding renovations. The entire facility was re-carpeted, repainted, and the public spaces were upgraded.

In order to preserve the privacy of the hotel and bungalows, higher fences plus coverings were used to discourage the public from looking into the grounds.

On July 28, 2020, the Chateau Marmont announced plans to convert to a members-only hotel, although at least one restaurant would remain open to the public.

On September 16, 2020, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; published a report involving accounts from more than thirty former hotel employees that accused the hotel&#x27;s management and Balazs of fomenting racial discrimination and sexual harassment practices at the hotel; they also accused Balazs of neglecting to provide them with adequate health insurance during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspected the hotel&#x27;s members-only conversion as an attempt to prevent unionization among the hotel&#x27;s employees. Despite the denial of the allegations by the hotel management and Balazs, multiple employment discrimination lawsuits were filed against the hotel, with the hotel facing picketing from labor union UNITE HERE and boycotts from numerous celebrities; in support of the boycott, a night shoot at the hotel for Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot; was canceled just hours before the intended start of production.

On May 1, 2024, paramedics were called to the hotel when Britney Spears and her boyfriend allegedly got into a domestic dispute. Spears was seen leaving the hotel wearing just her underwear and covering herself with a blanket as she walked out barefoot. Spears did not seek medical assistance despite the alleged incident. 

== Dining ==
The hotel restaurant terrace features market-fresh California cuisine from chef Dean Yasharian. The restaurant Bar Marmont closed in 2017.

In July 2018, Chateau Hanare, a new restaurant, opened in a former residential building on the eastern edge of the property. Balazs had spent five years courting the restaurateur, Reika Alexander of New York City&#x27;s EN Japanese Brasserie.

== In popular culture ==

Throughout the years, Chateau Marmont has gained recognition. Anthony Bourdain, Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Death Grips, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Anthony Kiedis, Annie Leibovitz, Courtney Love, Lana Del Rey, Jay McInerney, Helmut Newton, Dorothy Parker, Nicholas Ray, Terry Richardson, Hunter S. Thompson, and Bruce Weber, among others, have produced work at the hotel. Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor married the band&#x27;s hairdresser Tracey Wilson at the hotel in 1982.

=== On film ===

Director Sofia Coppola shot her film &quot;Somewhere&quot; at the hotel in 2010. The hotel also appears in the Academy Award-winning films &quot;La La Land&quot; (2016) and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (2018), as well as &quot;The Night Walker&quot; (1964), &quot;The Strip&quot; (1951)&quot;, Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970), &quot;Blume in Love&quot; (1973), &quot;The Doors&quot; (1991), &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; (1993), &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot; (2003), and &quot;Maps to the Stars&quot; (2014). The opening scene from &quot;The Canyons&quot; (2013) was shot at the now-closed Bar Marmont.

=== In literature ===

The Chateau is featured—often as a setting—in many books, including Martin Amis&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot; (1984) (as the Vraimont), Eve Babitz&#x27;s &quot;Eve&#x27;s Hollywood&quot; (1974) and &quot;Slow Days, Fast Company&quot; (1977), James Ellroy&#x27;s &quot;The Big Nowhere&quot; (1988), Dominick Dunne&#x27;s &quot;An Inconvenient Woman&quot; (1990) and &quot;Another City, Not My Own&quot; (1997), Charles Bukowski&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1989), Lee Child&#x27;s &quot;Bad Luck and Trouble&quot; (2007), Lauren Weisberger&#x27;s &quot;Last Night at Chateau Marmont&quot; (2010), and Michael Connelly&#x27;s &quot;The Drop&quot; (2011). It is also the office of fictional paparazzo Patrick Immleman in the Panel Syndicate web comic &quot;The Private Eye&quot;.

=== In music ===

The hotel has also been referred to in many songs, including the title track &quot;Plastic Hearts&quot; by Miley Cyrus from her 2020 album, &quot;chateau&quot; by blackbear from his 2017 album &quot;digital druglord&quot;, Panic! At The Disco&#x27;s &quot;Dying in LA&quot;, the Grateful Dead&#x27;s &quot;West L.A. Fadeaway&quot; from the album &quot;In the Dark&quot;, Lana Del Rey&#x27;s 2011 single &quot;Off to the Races&quot; from &quot;Born to Die,&quot; Father John Misty&#x27;s &quot;Chateau Lobby #4 (in C for Two Virgins)&quot; from &quot;I Love You, Honeybear&quot; (2015), Angus &amp; Julia Stone&#x27;s 2017 single &quot;Chateau&quot; from &quot;Snow&quot;, Lily Allen&#x27;s 2017 single &quot;Trigger Bang&quot; from &quot;No Shame&quot;, and Joshua Radin&#x27;s 2020 single &quot;Chateau.&quot; In 2017, Jarvis Cocker and Chilly Gonzales collaborated on a concept album of music inspired by the hotel, named &quot;Room 29&quot;, after one of the rooms with a piano. The cover photos for various albums have been taken at the hotel, including Gram Parsons&#x27;s &quot;GP&quot; and Death Grips&#x27;s infamous &quot;No Love Deep Web&quot;, and many musicians have performed live at the hotel, including Anne Pigalle.
In December 2023, Miley Cyrus gave a private Concert performing her best songs of the year.

=== In art and fashion ===

Actor James Franco created a replica of the Chateau&#x27;s Bungalow 2 for his &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; exhibit at MOCA in 2012. The hotel&#x27;s stationery has featured in work by artists André, Gary Baseman, Robert Gober, Martin Kippenberger, and Claes Oldenburg, among others. The Chateau&#x27;s branding was featured in a capsule collection from fashion label Gucci in 2018.

=== Deaths ===

John Belushi died of a drug overdose in Bungalow 3 on March 5, 1982. Photographer Helmut Newton died on January 23, 2004, after suffering a heart attack and crashing his car when pulling out of the driveway.

<doc id="350046" wikidata="Q160169" url="?curid=350046" title="Dacha">
<text>A dacha (Belarusian, Ukrainian and ) is a seasonal or year-round second home, often located in the exurbs of post-Soviet countries, including Russia. A cottage (, &quot;&quot;) or shack serving as a family&#x27;s main or only home, or an outbuilding, is not considered a dacha, although some dachas recently have been converted to year-round residences and vice versa.

The noun &quot;dacha&quot;, coming from verb &quot;davat&quot; (&quot;to give&quot;), originally referred to land allotted by the tsar to his nobles; and indeed the dacha in Soviet times is similar to the allotment in some Western countries – a piece of land allotted, normally free, to citizens by the local government for gardening or growing vegetables for personal consumption. With time the name for the land was applied to the building on it. In some cases, owners occupy their dachas for part of the year and rent them to urban residents as summer retreats. People living in dachas are colloquially called &quot;dachniki&quot; (); the term usually refers not only to dacha dwellers but to a distinctive lifestyle. The Russian term is often said to have no exact counterpart in English.

Dachas are common in Russia, and are also widespread in most parts of the former Soviet Union and in some countries of the former Eastern Bloc. Surveys in 1993–1994 suggest about 25% of Russian families living in large cities had dachas. Most dachas are in colonies of dachas and garden plots near large cities. These clusters have existed since the Soviet era, and consist of numerous small land plots. They were initially intended only as recreation getaways of city dwellers and for growing small gardens for food.

Dachas originated as small country estates given as a gift by the tsar, and have been popular among the Russian upper- and middle-classes ever since. During the Soviet era, many dachas were state-owned, and were given to the people. The government of the Russian Federation continues to own State dachas (&quot;&quot;) used by the president and other officials. They were extremely popular in the Soviet Union.

As regulations severely restricted the size and type of dacha buildings for ordinary people during the Soviet period, permitted features such as large attics or glazed verandas became extremely widespread and often oversized. In the period from the 1960s to 1985, legal limitations were especially strict: only single-story summer houses without permanent heating and with living areas less than were allowed as second housing (though older dachas that did not meet these requirements continued to exist). In the 1980s, planners loosened the rules, and since 1990 all such limitations have been eliminated. As of 2019, about 62% of Russians visit dachas in the summer.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The first dachas in Russia began to appear during the 17th century, initially referring to small estates in the country that were given to loyal vassals by the tsar. In archaic Russian, the word &quot;dacha&quot; means &quot;something given&quot;, from the verb &quot;дать&quot; [dat&#x27;] – &quot;to give&quot;. During the Age of Enlightenment, Russian aristocracy used their dachas for social and cultural gatherings, which were usually accompanied by masquerade balls and firework displays. The coming of the Industrial Revolution to Russia brought about a rapid growth in the urban population, and wealthy urban residents increasingly desired to escape the heavily polluted cities, at least temporarily.

By the end of the 19th century, the dacha became a favorite summer retreat for the upper and middle classes of Russian society. In the tsarist era, dachas tended to have pleasure gardens, but were not used much for growing food. Maxim Gorky wrote a novelette entitled &quot;Dachniki&quot; (1885), about newlywed city-dwellers living a &#x27;simple&#x27; summer life of walks in the countryside.

=== Soviet Union ===
Following the Russian Revolution, most dachas were nationalised. Some were converted into vacation homes for factory workers, while others, usually of better quality, were distributed among the prominent functionaries of the Communist Party and the newly emerged cultural and scientific elite. All but a few dachas remained the property of the state and the right to use them was usually revoked when a dacha occupant was dismissed or fell out of favour with the rulers of the state. Building new dachas required permission from senior officials and was rarely granted during the early years of the Soviet Union. The seniormost Soviet leaders all had their own dachas, and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s favourite was in Gagra, Abkhazia. New dachas started to be built in larger numbers during the 1930s, and dacha colonies for artists, or soldiers, or various classes of party functionaries, started to form.

There were legal size restrictions for dacha houses in the Soviet era. They had to have not more than of living area and be only one story tall. For that reason, they usually had a mansard roof, which was considered by authorities as just a large garret or attic, not a second story. Often ill-equipped and without indoor plumbing, dachas were nevertheless a solution for millions of working-class families, to have their own form of summer retreat. Having a piece of land also offered an opportunity for city dwellers to indulge themselves in growing their own fruits and vegetables.

In the years before and after World War II, cultivation of garden crops on dacha plots was substantial, because of the failure of the centrally planned Soviet agricultural programme to supply enough fresh produce. Many dacha owners grew crops for market. Since then, growing garden crops has been of lesser importance, but continues to be widespread. Many Russian dacha owners still see gardening as a key value of &quot;dachnik&quot; culture. Keeping historical food shortages in mind, they take great pride in growing their own food rather than buying it at a store.

The period after World War II saw moderate growth in dacha development. Since there was no actual law banning the construction of dachas, people began occupying unused plots of land near cities and towns, growing gardens and building sheds, huts, and more prominent dwellings that served as dachas. As time passed, the number of squatters grew and the government had no choice but to officially recognise their right to amateur farming.

The 1955 legislation introduced a new type of legal person into the Soviet juridical system, a gardeners&#x27; partnership (, &quot;sadovodcheskoye tovarishchestvo&quot;), similar to &quot;community gardens&quot; in other countries. The gardeners&#x27; partnership received the right to permanent use of land exclusively for agricultural purposes and permission to connect to public electrical and water supply networks. In 1958, yet another form of organisation was introduced, a &quot;cooperative for dacha construction&quot; (, &quot;dachno-stroytelniy kooperativ&quot;), which recognised the right of an individual to build a small house on the land leased from the government.

The 1980s saw the peak of the dacha boom, with nearly all affluent families—over a third of families in urban areas—having a dacha of their own. Dacha houses built since the late 1980s are significantly larger than older ones because legal size restrictions were liberalized, and new dacha areas became fields of relatively big houses on tiny land plots. Tracts between lines of dacha land plots are usually unimproved or improved with crushed stone, and narrow (often about between fences) enough that two cars can hardly pass each other by.

Dachas also started to be found in other Eastern Bloc countries, especially in East Germany (where it remains quite current even after German reunification), and in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.

=== Post-Soviet ===

In the 1990s, there was great unemployment in Russia and other post-Soviet states, and salaries in factories and research institutes that still functioned were sometimes not paid for many months. In these hard times potatoes grown in garden plots saved many people from hunger, and fruit and berries helped prevent vitamin deficiency.

Due to the rapid increase in urbanization in Russia, many village houses are currently being sold for use as dachas. Many Russian villages now have &quot;dachniki&quot; as temporary residents. Some villages have been fully transformed into dacha settlements, while some older dacha settlements often look like more permanent lodgings. The advantages of purchasing a dacha in a village usually are lower costs, greater land area, and larger distances between houses. The disadvantages may include lower-quality utilities, less security, and typically a farther distance to travel.

The means of transportation for people to get to their dachas, besides cars, are &quot;water trams&quot;, buses, and electric trains (colloquially called &quot;elektrichka&quot;). Due to the large number of people traveling to dachas at weekends (especially during the summer), traffic typically builds up around large cities, and elektrichka and buses are filled to capacity.

Dachas have started appearing in regions of North America that have high concentrations of immigrants from Russia and Ukraine. Russians and Ukrainians from New York, Long Island, and New Jersey have been retreating to their Russian-style dacha homes in the forests of Upstate New York in order to recreate the dacha experiences they had during the Soviet era.

==Dacha gardens==
Dacha plots are usually not more than in area; in some cases over , but nearly never exceeding . They therefore are too small to grow any large amount of fruits and vegetables, thus sometimes they are also grown on separate dedicated plots of ground nearby. In Soviet times and sometimes now, such dedicated plots of ground were often made of the unused sections of agricultural fields owned by collective farms. Many small dacha plots, especially those that were recently purchased, are not used for large-scale fruit and vegetable farming. Instead, they are frequently used for gardening and planting exotic plants.

Due to custom and the perceived high costs of good equipment, even relatively large plots of land are often cultivated manually using equipment such as a spade or a spading fork. In autumn the grown potatoes and other crops are gathered and transported to the city where they are stored in cellars, dugouts (usually located on unused plots of ground), or in personal automobile garages.

Many Russians prefer to grow vegetables themselves because of the widespread belief in the excessive use of agrochemicals in the vegetables from supermarkets and grocery stores, and the higher costs of the vegetables in stores and bazaars, especially among the older part of the population. Also, growing one&#x27;s own food supplies is a long-lived Russian tradition practised even by many affluent Russians. It is seen as a way to have a connection to the land, to be self-sufficient, and for many, to find some escape from a capitalist economy.

While a large portion of urban Russians grow some vegetables in their dacha gardens, the perception in some parts of society that urban Russians are becoming increasingly self-sufficient is a myth, and only some 15 percent of vegetables are grown by urban dwellers.

The most common dacha fruits in cool temperate regions of Russia are apple, blackcurrant, redcurrant, gooseberry, raspberry and strawberry (sometimes also sour cherry, downy cherry, rose hips, plum, bird cherry, pear, sea-buckthorn, &quot;Actinidia kolomikta&quot;, black chokeberry, serviceberry, barberry, sweetberry honeysuckle, blackberry and grape, but many of them are either rare or not hardy enough and require winter protection). Popular vegetables and herbs are potato, cucumber, zucchini, pumpkin, tomato, carrot, red bell peppers (capsicum), beetroot, cabbage, cauliflower, radish, turnip, onion, garlic, dill, parsley, rhubarb, sorrel, papaver, earth apple, horseradish and others. 

==Elite dachas==

=== Gosdachas===

The state-owned vacation houses allotted for government officials, academicians, military personnel, and other VIPs are called &quot;gosdachas&quot; (, short for &quot;gosudarstvennaya dacha&quot;— &quot;state dacha&quot;). In modern Russia, the Federal Property Agency of Russia continues to own numerous estates throughout the country that are leased, often on non-market terms, to government officials. The President of Russia has official dacha residences in Novo-Ogaryovo and Zavidovo. Gosdachas in Komarovo and Peredelkino, Zhukovka, Barvikha, and Usovo and Rublyovka in Moscow are populated by many Soviet-era intellectuals and artists. Russian President Vladimir Putin has a dacha in the Karelian Isthmus, as part of a cooperative society called Ozero, and one in Sochi.

===Modern elite dachas===
In modern times, the rise of a new class in the Russian society (the &#x27;new Russians&#x27;) has added a new dimension to the concept of dacha. (Some wealthy Russians prefer the term &#x27;cottage&#x27; for their country homes.)

With construction costs often reaching into the millions of U.S. dollars, the dachas of the country&#x27;s elite bear no resemblance to the small dachas of the Soviet era. Comparable in size and décor to mansions and palaces, they become an elaborate display of social status, wealth and power. Most dachas of the elite are constructed with brick and concrete, unlike the middle-class dachas that are mostly constructed with wood.

These new symbols of prosperity are designed by professional architects, usually in eclectic style—that older &quot;dachniks&quot; look down upon as reflecting the nouveau-riche tastes of their owners—and feature ostentatious items such as marble statues, fountains and exotic plants. Some have state-of-the-art sporting facilities such as an indoor swimming pool, multiple tennis courts and stables for race horses. A few privately owned estates even have small forests and lakes.

Wealthy Russians have also bought up many of the tsarist-era dachas of the aristocracy, and Soviet-era dachas of artists and intellectuals.

==Dachas and crimes==

Theft is not unusual for dachas. Usually, the dachas are either without surveillance or only one single guard taking care of the entire property. In an attempt to prevent these thefts, dacha owners often take everything valuable back to their apartments in the city at the end of summer. Typically dishes, tools and clothes are stolen. Homeless people and criminals often use the dachas in autumn and winter when the owners are absent. Occasionally minors light unsupervised dachas on fire as entertainment. 

Thieves also break into dachas with the intention of stealing non-ferrous metal, like gold, copper and silver. This happened to the leader of LDPR, Igor Lebedev, in 2000. Two men broke into his dacha in Odintsovo District after which they were stopped by police officers. The Moscow City Police press claims that collectors of non-ferrous metal are a big problem for the Moscow region and that they come from several different nearby regions.

Because of drug abuse becoming more prevalent, poppies are now being stolen from dachas more often. That is why growing more than two poppy plants is now considered a crime.
In 2008, unknown men robbed 10 dachas, including the famous &quot;Zelyonaya budka&quot; () that belonged to the famous Russian poet Anna Akhmatova in the settlement Litfonda in Komarovo.

In 2002, the United States citizen Yakov Tilipman, who was representing the interests of the &quot;Kremlyovskaya group&quot;, was shot in the protected gardening association &quot;Yagodka&quot; () in Opalikha in the Krasnogorsk region of Moscow. In 2008, robbers in camouflage uniforms climbed over a fence and made their way into the dacha of the TV host Aleksandr Tsekalo in Krasnogorsk, where his relatives were tied up and robbed.

<doc id="350048" wikidata="Q432919" url="?curid=350048" title="Maxwell Anderson">
<text>James Maxwell Anderson (December 15, 1888 – February 28, 1959) was an American playwright, author, poet, journalist, and lyricist.

Anderson faced many challenges in his career, frequently losing jobs for expressing his opinions or supporting controversial figures. Despite this, he found success as a dramatist and wrote a number of hit plays, including &quot;What Price Glory&quot;, &quot;Both Your Houses&quot;, and &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;. Many of his works were adapted for the screen, and he wrote screenplays for other authors&#x27; works as well. Anderson was married three times and had a tumultuous personal life, dying in 1959 after suffering a stroke. His papers and personal effects can be found in various institutions, with the largest collection housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

==Background==
Anderson was born on December 15, 1888, in Atlantic, Pennsylvania, the second of eight children to William Lincoln &quot;Link&quot; Anderson, a Baptist minister, and Charlotte Perrimela (&#x27;Premely&#x27;) Stephenson, both of Scotch-Irish descent. His family initially lived on his maternal grandmother Sheperd&#x27;s farm in Atlantic, then moved to Andover, Ohio, where his father became a railroad fireman while studying to become a minister. They moved often, to follow their father&#x27;s ministerial posts, and Maxwell was frequently sick, missing a great deal of school. He used his time sick in bed to read voraciously, and both his parents and Aunt Emma were storytellers, which contributed to Anderson&#x27;s love of literature.

During a visit to his grandmother&#x27;s house in Atlantic, at age 11, he met the first love of his life, Hallie Loomis, a slightly older girl from a wealthier family. His autobiographical tale &quot;Morning, Winter and Night&quot; told of rape, incest and sadomasochism on the farm. It was published under the pseudonym John Nairne Michealson to prevent offending family. The Andersons lived in Andover, Ohio; Richmond Center, Ohio; Townville, Pennsylvania; Edinboro, Pennsylvania; McKeesport, Pennsylvania; New Brighton, Pennsylvania; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Jamestown, North Dakota. Anderson attended Jamestown High School, graduating in 1908.

==Career==

===Journalist===
As an undergraduate, Anderson waited tables and worked at the night copy desk of the &quot;Grand Forks Herald&quot;, and he was active in the school&#x27;s literary and dramatic societies. He obtained a BA in English Literature from the University of North Dakota in 1911. Anderson became the principal of a high school in Minnewaukan, North Dakota, also teaching English there, but was fired in 1913 for making pacifist statements to his students. He then entered Stanford University, obtaining an Master&#x27;s degree in English Literature in 1914. He became a high school English teacher in San Francisco. After three years, Anderson became chairman of the English department at Whittier College in 1917. He was fired after a year for public statements supporting Arthur Camp, a jailed student seeking status as a conscientious objector.

Anderson moved to Palo Alto to write for the &quot;San Francisco Evening Bulletin&quot;, but he was fired for writing an editorial stating that it would be impossible for Germany to pay its war debt. He then moved to San Francisco to write for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, but he was fired after contracting the Spanish flu and missing work. Alvin S. Johnson hired Anderson to move to New York City and write about politics for &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1918, but he was fired after an argument with Editor-in-Chief Herbert David Croly.

Anderson found work at &quot;The New York Globe&quot; and the &quot;New York World&quot;. In 1921 he founded &quot;The Measure: A Journal of Poetry&quot;, a magazine devoted to verse. Anderson wrote &quot;White Desert&quot;, his first play, in 1923; it ran only 12 performances, but it was well reviewed by Laurence Stallings of the &quot;New York World&quot;, who collaborated with him on his next play &quot;What Price Glory?&quot;, which was successfully produced in 1924 in New York City. Afterward, Anderson resigned from the &quot;World&quot;, launching his career as a dramatist.

===Dramatist===
His plays are in widely varying styles, and Anderson was one of the few modern playwrights to make extensive use of blank verse. Some of these were adapted as films, and Anderson wrote the screenplays of other authors&#x27; plays and novels – &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) and &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot; (1934) – in addition to books of poetry and essays. His first Broadway hit was the 1924 World War I comedy-drama, &quot;What Price Glory&quot;, written with Laurence Stallings. The play made use of profanity, which caused censors to protest. However, the chief censor (Rear Admiral Charles Peshall Plunkett) was discredited because he was found to have written far more obscene letters to General Chamberlaine.

The only one of his plays that he adapted to the screen was &quot;Joan of Lorraine&quot;, which became the film &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948), starring Ingrid Bergman, with a screenplay by Anderson and Andrew Solt. When Bergman and her director changed much of his dialogue to make Joan &quot;a plaster saint&quot;, he called her a &quot;big, dumb, goddamn Swede!&quot; Anderson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1933 for his political drama &quot;Both Your Houses&quot;, and twice received the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, for &quot;Winterset&quot;, and &quot;High Tor&quot;.

Anderson enjoyed great commercial success with a series of plays set during the reign of the Tudor family, who ruled England, Wales and Ireland from 1485 until 1603. One play in particular – &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; – the story of Henry VIII&#x27;s marriage to Anne Boleyn – was a hit on the stage in 1948, but did not reach movie screens for 21 years. It opened on Broadway starring Rex Harrison and Joyce Redman, and it became a 1969 movie with Richard Burton and Geneviève Bujold.

&quot;Elizabeth the Queen&quot; opened in 1930 with Lynn Fontanne as Elizabeth and Alfred Lunt as Lord Essex. It was adapted to the screen as &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939), starring Bette Davis and Errol Flynn. Directed by John Ford, &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot; (1936) was an adaptation of his play of the same name involving Elizabeth I, starring Katharine Hepburn as Mary, Queen of Scots, Fredric March as the Earl of Bothwell, and Florence Eldridge as Elizabeth. The original play had been a hit on Broadway with Helen Hayes in the title role.

His play &quot;The Wingless Victory&quot; was written in verse and premiered in 1936 with Broadway actress Katharine Cornell in the lead role. It received mixed reviews.

===Adaptations===
Two of Anderson&#x27;s other historical plays, &quot;Valley Forge&quot;, about George Washington&#x27;s winter there with the Continental Army, and &quot;Barefoot in Athens&quot;, concerning the trial of Socrates, were adapted for television. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was adapted for television on three occasions – in 1950, 1951 and 1975. Anderson wrote book and lyrics for two successful musicals with composer Kurt Weill. &quot;Knickerbocker Holiday&quot;, about the early Dutch settlers of New York, featured Walter Huston as Peter Stuyvesant. The show&#x27;s standout number &quot;September Song&quot; became a popular standard. So did the title song of Anderson and Weill&#x27;s &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;, a story of South Africa based on the Alan Paton novel &quot;Cry, The Beloved Country&quot;. In 1950, Anderson and Weill began collaboration on a musical adaptation of Mark Twain&#x27;s Huckleberry Finn, but Weill died when only a few songs had been completed for it.

&quot;Saturday&#x27;s Children&quot;, Anderson&#x27;s long-running 1927 comedy-drama about married life, in which Humphrey Bogart made an early appearance, was filmed three times – in 1929 as a part-talkie, in 1935 (in almost unrecognizable form) as a B-film &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Love&quot;, and again in 1940 under its original title, starring John Garfield in one of his few romantic comedies. The play was adapted for television in three condensed versions in 1950, 1952 and 1962.

His last successful Broadway stage play was 1954&#x27;s &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;, Anderson&#x27;s adaption of the William March novel. He was hired by Alfred Hitchcock to write the screenplay for Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; (1957). Hitchcock also contracted with Anderson to write the screenplay for what became &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), but Hitchcock rejected his screenplay &quot;Darkling, I Listen&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Anderson married Margaret Haskett, a classmate, on August 1, 1911, in Bottineau, North Dakota. They had three sons, Quentin, Alan, and Terence.

In 1929, Anderson wrote &quot;Gypsy&quot;, what would prove to be a prophetic play about a vain, neurotic liar who cheats on her husband then kills herself by inhaling gas after he catches her. It is around this same time, , that Anderson began a relationship with a married actress, Gertrude Higger (married name, Mab Maynard, stage name Mab Anthony). The affair led Anderson to split with Haskett, who later died in 1931 following a car accident and stroke.

Mab divorced her husband, singer Charles V. Maynard, and moved in with Anderson. She was a significant help with clerical duties, but had expensive tastes and spent Anderson&#x27;s money freely. Their daughter Hesper was born August 1934. Anderson left Maynard following the discovery of her affair with Max&#x27;s friend, TV producer Jerry Stagg. The combination of losing Anderson, their massive tax debt, and the loss of her home proved too much for Mab, who on March 21, 1953, after several attempts, killed herself by breathing car exhaust. Hesper wrote a book, &quot;South Mountain Road: A Daughter&#x27;s Journey of Discovery&quot; describing how following her mother&#x27;s suicide, she unearthed the fact that her parents never married.

Anderson then married Gilda Hazard on June 6, 1954. This marriage was a happy one, lasting until Anderson&#x27;s 1959 death.

Anderson was an atheist.

Anderson died in Stamford, Connecticut, on February 28, 1959, two days after suffering a stroke, aged 70. He was cremated. Half of his ashes were scattered by the sea near his home in Stamford. The other half was buried in Anderson Cemetery near his birthplace in rural northwestern Pennsylvania. The inscription on his tombstone reads: 

==Awards==
Honorary awards include the gold medal in Drama from the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1954, an honorary doctor of literature degree from Columbia University in 1946, and an honorary doctor of humanities degree from the University of North Dakota in 1958.

== Archive ==
The largest collection of Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s papers – over sixty boxes – is housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin and includes published and unpublished manuscript materials for plays, poems, and essays, as well as over 2,000 letters, diaries, financial papers, nearly 1,500 family photographs, and personal memorabilia are preserved along with 160 books from the playwright&#x27;s library. The archive was placed at the Ransom Center in 1961 by Anderson&#x27;s widow, Mrs. Gilda Hazard Anderson. Smaller collections of Anderson&#x27;s papers can be found at institutions around the world, including the Chester Fritz Library, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

<text>Charles Albanel (; 1616 – 11 January 1696), born in Ardes or Auvergne, was a French missionary explorer in Canada, and a Jesuit priest.

==Life==
Charles Albanel entered the Society of Jesus in 1633 at Toulouse. In 1635 he began teaching at various Jesuit colleges, studied philosophy at Billom and theology at Tournon.

He sailed for Canada in 1649 and arrived at Quebec in late August. A month later he was sent to Ville-Marie. He wintered among the Montagnais, and in the spring traveled to Tadoussac to tend those suffering from fever.

In July 1660, on a return from Trois-Rivières with Governor Voyer d&#x27;Argenson, their boat was attacked by Iroquois. In August, René Ménard was sent west from Montreal with a trading party of Ottawa and the fur traders Radisson and Groseilliers, heading for what is now northern Wisconsin, aiming to establish a mission among the Ottawa. Albanel met Ménard at Montreal and was to accompany him, but the Ottawa objected to his Indian companion and they were not allowed to join the group. Ménard never returned. That spring Ménard had heard that a band of Hurons in the interior was starving, and he set off to minister to them. He and a fur trader nicknamed L&#x27;Esperance became separate at a portage near some rapids. Menard, weak with hunger himself, disappeared in the wilderness. His cassock and breviary were later found among the Dakotas.

Albanel became parish priest at Cap-de-la-Madeleine until August 1665, although he retained responsibility for the missions. In October 1666 Albanel served as chaplain for the Carignan-Salières Regiment in a campaign against the Mohawk. He was Superior at Sillery in 1668, but back at the Sainte-Croix mission near Tadoussac for the winter during a smallpox epidemic. Tadoussac served as his base while traveling to other infected settlements. He, too, became ill, but recovered. The following spring he headed north and received reports of English fur traders in Hudson&#x27;s Bay. In June 1670 he left Tadoussac to work among the Innu of Pessamit.

In the year 1672, at the time when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was beginning operations, he was a leader of a French party that went by the Saguenay River, Lake Mistassini, and the Rupert River to Hudson Bay. Albanel was chosen because he knew the tribes most familiar with the route. He may have been the first European to reach Hudson Bay from the Saint Lawrence.

In 1674, on another journey to the Rupert River he was captured by the English and taken to England. On his journey to England he induced Medard des Groseilliers to return to the French service. After returning in 1688 to Canada, he served at missions in western Canada and died at Sault Ste. Marie at the age of eighty.

==Legacy==
Lake Albanel, which runs parallel and to the east of Lake Mistassini, is named after him.
The Charles Albanel rose, developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, was named in his honour.

<doc id="350052" wikidata="Q973687" url="?curid=350052" title="Will Vinton">
<text>William Gale Vinton (November 17, 1947 – October 4, 2018) was an American animator and filmmaker. Vinton was best known for his Claymation work, alongside creating iconic characters such as The California Raisins. He won an Oscar for his work alongside several Emmy Awards and Clio Awards for his studio&#x27;s work.

==Life and education==
Vinton was born on November 17, 1947, to a car dealer father and a bookkeeper mother in McMinnville, Oregon. His paternal grandfather, William T. Vinton, was a well known state senator in Oregon, representing Portland.

During the 1960s, Vinton studied physics, architecture and filmmaking at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was influenced by the work of Antoni Gaudí. During this time, Vinton made a feature-length documentary film about the California counter-culture movement titled &quot;Gone for a Better Deal&quot;, which toured college campuses in various film festivals of the time. Two more films about student protest followed, &quot;Berkeley Games&quot; and &quot;First Ten Days&quot;, as well a narrative short &quot;Reply&quot;, and his first animation, &quot;Culture Shock&quot;.

Vinton received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture from UC Berkeley in 1970.

==Career==
===Collaboration with Bob Gardiner===
Meeting clay animator Bob Gardiner in the Berkeley, California, area in the early 1970s, Vinton brought him to Portland and they commandeered Vinton&#x27;s home basement to make a quick 1½-minute test film of clay animation (and the supporting armatures) called &quot;Wobbly Wino&quot;, completed in early 1973. Gardiner refined his sculpting and animation techniques while Vinton built a system for animating his Bolex Rex-5 16mm camera and they began work in mid-1973 on an 8-minute 16mm short film about a drunk wino who stumbles into a closed art museum and interacts with the paintings and sculptures. Completed in late 1974 after 14 months of production, the film combined Gardiner&#x27;s sculpting skills and comedy writing talent with Vinton&#x27;s camera skills. &quot;Closed Mondays&quot; won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in the spring of 1975, the first film produced in Portland to do so.

Vinton and Gardiner parted ways during the production of their second short film, &quot;Mountain Music&quot; completed by Vinton in 1976. Gardiner focused on producing PSA spots for local political issues (eventually evolving into other artistic media such as music and holograms) while Vinton established Will Vinton Productions (later Will Vinton Studios) in Portland to capitalize on the animation technology Gardiner had developed for their animated short &quot;Closed Mondays&quot;. Quickly expanding his studio by hiring new animators, Vinton produced dozens of commercials for regional and then national companies.

== Will Vinton Studios ==
===Going solo===
Still with only a handful of animators, Vinton produced a trilogy of 27-minute films of a short stories like fairy tales in the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as &quot;Martin the Cobbler&quot; (1977), the Oscar-nominated &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Little Prince&quot; (1979). These films were later released theatrically under the umbrella title &quot;Trilogy&quot;, and later to video as &quot;The Little Prince and Friends&quot;. In 1978, Vinton produced the documentary &quot;Claymation: Three Dimensional Clay Animation&quot; a 17-minute film featuring the behind-the-scenes technical processes used. The term &quot;claymation&quot; was later trademarked by Vinton, and has become synonymous with clay animation in general.

===35mm years===
Graduating to 35mm film, Vinton produced other short films during this time: &quot;Legacy&quot; (1979), &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (1980), &quot;The Creation&quot; (directed by Joan Gratz, 1981, Oscar nominated), &quot;The Great Cognito&quot; (directed by Barry Bruce, 1982, Oscar nominated), &quot;A Christmas Gift&quot;, and the music video &quot;Vanz Kant Danz&quot; (1987) for Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s John Fogerty. VHS video compilations of these films were released in the 1980s as &quot;Festival of Claymation&quot; and &quot;Son of Combo II&quot;.

Vinton, no longer performing animation himself, later produced special effects scenes for TV shows and movies, including a sequence for Bette Midler&#x27;s &quot;Divine Madness!&quot; movie (1980), an Emmy-winning sequence for the &quot;Moonlighting&quot; TV series (1987), and the opening &amp; closing title sequences for the feature comedy film &quot;Brain Donors&quot; (1992). His company&#x27;s animation effects for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Return to Oz&quot; (1985) were also nominated for a special effects Oscar. In May 1985, Will Vinton Productions released their first and only theatrical film &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot;.

Following his work on &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, Vinton was hired by the Disney studio to produce animation effects for their Michael Jackson Disneyland-EPCOT Center film, &quot;Captain EO&quot; in 1986 and the &quot;Speed Demon&quot; music video for Michael Jackson&#x27;s musical anthology feature-length film, &quot;Moonwalker&quot; (1988).

Prominent among his hundreds of now international commercial creations were the California Raisins, the Domino&#x27;s Pizza Noid, and the M&amp;M&#x27;s Red, Yellow, Blue, Green and Crispy (Orange) characters.

The California Raisins&#x27; first big hit was the song &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; in the first of their series of TV spots for the California Raisin Advisory Board. They became such a media phenomenon that they went on to star in their own pair of primetime specials for CBS television, &quot;Meet the Raisins&quot; (1988), &quot;The Raisins Sold Out&quot; (1990), and a cel-animated show, &quot;The California Raisins Show&quot;. A couple of music albums of songs from the specials, produced by Nu Shooz pop rock band leader John Smith were also released.

CBS also commissioned three more prime-time specials, &quot;Will Vinton&#x27;s Claymation Christmas Celebration&quot; (1987), &quot;Claymation Comedy of Horrors&quot; (1991), and &quot;Claymation Easter&quot; (1992). &quot;Will Vinton&#x27;s Claymation Christmas Celebration&quot; and &quot;Claymation Easter&quot; won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. Claymation Comedy of Horrors was nominated for this category, but lost to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. All were later released to video and DVD.

In the 1990s, a variety of Vinton&#x27;s 400 + animators and technicians helped with new creations and films of their own using the Vinton facilities called the &quot;Walkabout Program&quot;. Craig Bartlett created his short film &quot;Arnold Escapes From Church&quot; (1988) and generated two more clay-animated short films, &quot;The Arnold Waltz&quot; (1990) and &quot;Arnold Rides a Chair&quot; (1991), each would later spawned &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, a cel-animated series for Nickelodeon in 1996.

===Computer animation===
The mid-1990s also saw Vinton adding computer animation to his output, used most visibly for his M&amp;M&#x27;s character commercials. A short CGI film, &quot;Fluffy&quot;, directed by Doug Aberle, was created during this time. Other CGI films—some combined with clay and stop-motion animation—soon followed. Vinton contributed to a consumer-grade computer animation application called &quot;&quot;, developed by Hash, Inc., a computer animation company in Vancouver, Washington.

In 1997, Brandon Tartikoff—in what would be his last substantial contribution to television before his death that year—commissioned Vinton to create a Christmas special, &quot;The Online Adventures of Ozzie the Elf&quot;. Ozzie the Elf was originally created as a mascot for America Online&#x27;s holiday portal, which Tartikoff (who was working for AOL at the time) saw as a potential crossover property. Vinton had high hopes that the special, which was animated in Claymation, would become a perennially rerun special.

===Switch from Claymation to Foamation===
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Vinton Studios produced the animated series &quot;The PJs&quot; for the FOX TV network. The series was conceived and executive-produced by actor and comedian Eddie Murphy. Another animated series was produced for the UPN TV network by the Vinton studio, &quot;Gary and Mike&quot;. &quot;Gary and Mike&quot; was shot using digital video capture system developed for the production by two Vinton engineers Miegel Ginsberg and Gary McRobert. Both series used a refinement in Vinton&#x27;s style of dimensional animation. Most of the clay figures were replaced by models of moulded foam rubber, eliminating many of the limitations, and maintenance issues, that are inherent with clay, which had been developed by Vinton and his technical teams as far as it could go. Vinton soon coined a new term for this process, &quot;Foamation&quot;. The studio also produced an unaired pilot for Slacker Cats in 2001.

===Decline===
By the end of the 1990s, the Vinton studio, seeking funds for more feature-length films, had become big enough to bring in outside investors, which included Nike, Inc., founder Phil Knight and his son, Travis, who had worked at the studio as an animator.

In spring of 2001, the studio&#x27;s animated shows, &quot;The PJs&quot; and &quot;Gary and Mike&quot;, were cancelled, with the latter only airing 13 episodes.

In 2002, Vinton lost control of the studio he founded after Knight became the majority shareholder and Vinton failed to garner funds for further feature production in Los Angeles, eventually being dismissed from the studio. Vinton later sought damages for this and sued for ownership of his name. In 2005, Will Vinton Studios was rebranded as Laika. Premiere stop-motion animator/director Henry Selick joined the studio as a supervising director. The studio currently produces theatrical films such as &quot;Coraline&quot;, &quot;ParaNorman&quot;, &quot;The Boxtrolls&quot;, &quot;Kubo and the Two Strings&quot;, and &quot;Missing Link&quot;.

===Aftermath===
Vinton later founded a new production facility, Will Vinton&#x27;s Free Will Entertainment, also based in Portland. In 2005, Vinton produced &quot;The Morning After&quot;, the first short film under the new company. The film combines CGI and live action. He also taught at the Portland branch of The Art Institutes and maintained an office there as an artist in residence. Vinton created a musical titled &quot;The Kiss&quot;, an adaptation of The Frog Prince with music by David Pomeranz that premiered on March 24, 2014, in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The Creative Artists Agency in Beverly Hills represented Vinton for production projects, which included a graphic novel called &quot;Jack Hightower&quot; produced in tandem with Dark Horse Comics.

==Illness, retirement, and death==
In 2006, Vinton was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and retired in 2008 from producing films. He died in Portland, Oregon, on October 4, 2018, after a 12-year battle with the disease at the age of 70. He was the subject of the documentary film &quot;Claydream&quot;, which was directed by Marq Evans and released at the 2021 Tribeca Film Festival.

==Archive==
The moving image collection of Will Vinton is housed at the Academy Film Archive. The Academy Film Archive has preserved several of Vinton&#x27;s films, including &quot;Closed Mondays&quot;, &quot;The Creation&quot;, &quot;The Great Cognito&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur&quot;, &quot;Legacy&quot;, and &quot;A Christmas Gift&quot;.

<doc id="350053" wikidata="Q5623261" url="?curid=350053" title="Jonathan P. Dolliver">
<text>Jonathan Prentiss Dolliver (February 6, 1858October 15, 1910) was a Republican orator, U.S. Representative, then U.S. Senator from Iowa at the turn of the 20th century. In 1900 and 1908 Republican National Conventions, he was promoted as a vice-presidential candidate, but he was never chosen.

==Background==
Dolliver was born in 1858 near Kingwood in Preston County, a Virginia county that would refuse to join the Confederacy and would instead remain in the Union as part of the new state of West Virginia. He attended the public schools and graduated from the West Virginia University at Morgantown in 1876. After studying law, Dolliver was admitted to the bar in 1878, and commenced practice in Fort Dodge, Iowa. He served as city solicitor of Fort Dodge from 1880 to 1887.

In 1884, as a twenty-six-year-old, Dolliver received national attention for his skills as an orator, when campaigning around the nation on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate James G. Blaine. A famous political quotation is attributed to Dolliver. Referring to his adopted state&#x27;s traditional allegiance with the Republican Party, Dolliver (son of a Methodist minister) said, &quot;Iowa will go Democratic when Hell goes Methodist.&quot;

==U.S. House==
In 1888, Dolliver challenged the incumbent congressman for Iowa&#x27;s 10th congressional district, Adoniram J. Holmes, for the Republican nomination. After 110 ballots in the district nominating convention, Dolliver won. He easily won the general election and began to represent in north-central Iowa in the United States House of Representatives in 1889. He was re-elected to the House five times. He served as chairman of the House Committee on Expenditures in the Fifty-sixth Congress.
In the 1900 presidential election, President William McKinley needed a successor to replace his first vice president, Garret Hobart, who died in November 1899. Dolliver was considered by some as a favorite to win the spot at the 1900 Republican National Convention. However, New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt, renowned for his victory in the Battle of San Juan Hill in the Spanish–American War, soon emerged as the leading candidate for that position. Dolliver stepped aside.

==U.S. Senate==
The following month (July 1900), Iowa U.S. Senator John H. Gear died while in office. Iowa Governor Leslie M. Shaw selected Dolliver to replace Gear. Dolliver was twice re-elected to the Senate by the Iowa General Assembly. In the Senate, he served as chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads in the Fifty-seventh through Fifty-ninth Congresses, Committee on Education and Labor in the Fifty-ninth and Sixtieth Congresses, and the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry in the Sixty-first Congress.

In the 1908 presidential election, Dolliver&#x27;s name was again touted as a potential vice-presidential candidate, this time on the ticket with William Howard Taft. As the convention approached Dolliver indicated that he preferred to remain in the Senate. In response to further pressure (and suggestions of support from the Roosevelt White House), he softened his position by indicating that he would not refuse the position if offered it. However, the Convention instead chose James S. Sherman.

During Dolliver&#x27;s service in the Senate, Iowa Republicans were divided between a conservative old guard that had dominated state politics since the Civil War, and a new progressive wing led by Albert B. Cummins, a lawyer and (after 1902) Governor of Iowa. The flash point for this division was Cummins&#x27; effort in 1908 to join Dolliver in the Senate by challenging legendary Senator William B. Allison in the Republican primary. Dolliver had a national reputation as a progressive. However, he supported Allison, who ultimately prevailed in the primary but died shortly thereafter, and was succeeded by Cummins. Dolliver soon reconciled with Cummins, and became increasingly aligned with Cummins in his party&#x27;s progressive wing.

==Death and legacy==
Dolliver died in office on October 15, 1910. He was interred in Oakland Cemetery in Fort Dodge, Iowa.

The small town of Dolliver, Iowa, established on a new railroad line in 1899, and Dolliver Memorial State Park south of Fort Dodge, were named in honor of him.

His nephew, James I. Dolliver, represented a similar area in Iowa in the U.S. House from 1945 to 1957.

<text>Sir Hugh Allan (September 29, 1810 – December 9, 1882) was a Scottish-Canadian shipping magnate, financier and capitalist. By the time of his death, the Allan Shipping Line had become the largest privately owned shipping empire in the world. He was responsible for transporting millions of British immigrants to Canada, and the businesses that he established from Montreal filtered across every sphere of Canadian life, cementing his reputation as an empire builder. His home, Ravenscrag, was the principal residence of the Golden Square Mile in Montreal.

==Early years in Scotland==
Born at Saltcoats in North Ayrshire, Scotland, he was the second son of Captain Alexander Allan and Jean Crawford (1782–1856). He was a first cousin of Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt, and his father was a first cousin of the Scottish bard, Robert Burns. In 1819, Allan&#x27;s father established the Allan Shipping Line, which became synonymous with transporting goods and passengers between Scotland and Montreal. Allan received a parish education at Saltcoats before starting work in 1823 at the family&#x27;s counting house of Allan, Kerr &amp; Co., of Greenock. Three years later, he was sent by his father to Montreal to work as a clerk for a grain merchant, William Kerr. In 1830, he took a year off to travel through his native Scotland (he later named his home, Ravenscrag, after his favourite childhood haunt in Ayrshire) and continued via London, New York and Upper Canada.

==Rise of the Allan Line at Montreal==

Returning to Montreal in 1831, Allan became a commission merchant with one of the city&#x27;s leading importers, who had also acted as the Montreal agent for his family&#x27;s company, J &amp; A Allan, back in Scotland. Concentrating on shipping, shipbuilding and purchasing grain, Allan advanced rapidly, aided by capital raised and contacts gained through family connections, as well as social bonds he developed himself in the predominantly Scottish business community at Montreal. By 1835, Allan was made a partner in the firm that from then was known as Millar, Edmonstone &amp; Co. With his father&#x27;s encouragement and capital, Allan expanded the company&#x27;s shipping operations, and J &amp; A Allan (then headed by his elder brother, James, in Glasgow) became closely involved with building of the merchant fleet. By the time (1839) Hugh&#x27;s younger brother, Andrew, had joined now Edmonstone, Allan &amp; Co., it had the largest shipping capacity of any Montreal-based firm.

By the 1850s, Edmonstone &amp; Allan was described by a credit-rating service as an &quot;old, safe and respectable House... one of the wealthiest concerns in the Province&quot;, known for its responsible management and its links to trading houses in London, Liverpool, and Glasgow. Helped by Allan&#x27;s spreading influence into allied shipping, railway and banking concerns, the firm was &quot;as good as a bank&quot;. From 1863, the company became known as H &amp; A Allan, of Montreal — one segment, but an important and intricate part of the Allan family&#x27;s empire.

==The Allan Royal Mail Line==

In 1851, Hugh Allan had been elected President of the Montreal Board of Trade. As an entrepreneur and the chosen head of Montreal&#x27;s business community, he used this position to advocate for the establishment of a regular government-subsidised steamship line between Britain, Montreal and Portland. The service, Allan declared, would deliver Royal Mail to both sides of the Atlantic Ocean while transporting immigrants to North America. Though it was Allan&#x27;s idea, competition for the contract was fierce. Despite significant support on both sides of the Atlantic and careful preparation, Allan lost the bid in 1853. However, the consortium that won the contract, headed by Samuel Cunard, ran into trouble almost immediately and Allan reacted by building more ships on the Clyde, using superior technology (notably the &quot;Canadian&quot; and the &quot;Indian&quot;). These ships formed the nucleus of Allan&#x27;s &quot;Montreal Ocean Steamship Company&quot;, incorporated by him and his brother, Andrew, in 1856. It was carefully created to be Canadian, but it was inextricably linked (and financed) by the Allan family in Scotland. In 1856, with the help of conservative politicians such as Sir John Rose, Sir George-Étienne Cartier and Lewis Drummond, the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company (popularly referred to as the Allan Line) wrested back the contract from Samuel Cunard. By 1859, service was weekly, and Allan reported his capital investment in the company at £3.5 million.

Beyond mail and emigrating passengers, the Allan Line carried royalty (converting one of its ships with no expense nor detail to attention spared), troops (in the Crimean and Zulu wars), general cargo, manufactured goods and much needed Canadian wheat to Britain. After the Victoria Bridge opened in 1859, Allan became dependent on the Grand Trunk Railway and signed a ten-year deal with them. But he soon became frustrated with the railway when he wanted them to triple their deliveries from the American Midwest, and he felt threatened by the railway&#x27;s plans to form a steamship line of its own with rival firms in New York and Boston. By 1873, Allan expressed &quot;a desire to protect ourselves&quot;.

==Railways and the Pacific Scandal==
At the same time that Allan was falling out with the Grand Trunk Railway, the Canadian government had committed to building a railway across to British Columbia. Though slow to move into the railway business, by the 1870s, Allan had become Canada&#x27;s most flamboyant railway entrepreneur. He helped to place trusted colleagues (such as his lawyer John Abbott, agent Louis Beaubien and the politician John Hamilton) in senior positions with railways connected to the venture. Allan himself invested heavily, particularly in those that would link the Port of Montreal to the Canadian West, and he became president of the Montreal Northern Colonization Railway in 1871. Garnering the support of French-Canada (helped in a large part by his relationship with Antoine Labelle), Allan&#x27;s railway gained major benefits in Quebec, including a $1 million subscription from the City of Montreal. Allan was reckoned the most influential capitalist in 1870s Canada, and having staved off American interest in the Pacific Railway, he was the logical choice for winning the contract.

He created a syndicate to build the national railway, promised as a condition of British Columbia joining Confederation. To ensure the contract, he bribed Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, subscribing over $350,000 for Macdonald&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1872, but the Pacific Scandal (and Macdonald&#x27;s defeat) ended his dreams of supremacy in the railway business. However, through his bank, the Merchants&#x27; Bank of Canada, he still financed and maintained a vested interest in many of the Canadian railway companies.

==Merchants&#x27; Bank of Canada==

While still in his thirties, Allan became a director of the Bank of Montreal and remained on the board for ten years (1847–57). He also held significant shares in the Commercial Bank of Canada, the Bank of Upper Canada, the Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada, and the City Bank of Montreal. He was a director of the Montreal Credit Company and president of the Provincial Permanent Building Society, which became the Provincial Loan Company in 1875. Allan founded Merchant&#x27;s Bank of Canada in Montreal in 1864, with a capital of $6.78 million and a reserve fund of $6.8 million.

To service his financial needs and as a source of capital, Allan established the Merchant&#x27;s Bank of Canada. Run as a family business, it was chartered in 1861 but did not open until 1864. Allan served as president of the bank until his death, when he was succeeded by his brother, Andrew. The bank soon became known as one of Canada&#x27;s most aggressive. They took over the failing Commercial Bank of Canada, and by the mid-1870s had branches in New York and London.

Allan&#x27;s association with the bank facilitated his growth in other profitable ventures. Allan had interests in new communications technology, manufacturing, and mining. In 1852, he became president of the Montreal Telegraph Company, ultimately selling MTC&#x27;s &quot;telephone plant&quot; to Bell Telephone for $75,000. He also established coal mines in Nova Scotia and factories for textiles, shoes, paper, tobacco, and iron and steel in Central Canada.
The Merchants Bank Building on 92-94 Water Street, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, built in 1871, is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada.

==Ravenscrag==
In 1860, Allan bought part of the estate of Simon McTavish and demolished the old manor house to make way for his new home, Ravenscrag, a sumptuous Italian Renaissance style house and the principal residence of the Golden Square Mile. The house, which surpassed Dundurn Castle in scale and grandeur, was completed in three years in 1863, and the ballroom alone could comfortably accommodate several hundred guests.

After his death in 1882, his second son, Sir Montagu Allan, lived in the house. In 1940, he donated it to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal. The Allans entertained Prince Arthur of Connaught, Lord Lisgar, the Earl of Dufferin, Viscount Wolseley, and others.

==Marriage and children==

At Montreal on August 13, 1844, Allan married Matilda Caroline Smith (1828–1881), the eldest of the four daughters of Betsy Rea and her husband John Smith (d. 1872) of Athelstane Hall, Montreal. John Smith was a native of Athelstaneford in Scotland and became one of Montreal&#x27;s leading dry goods merchants. Caroline&#x27;s sister, Isabella, married Allan&#x27;s brother Andrew in 1848. Her two other sisters married respectively Hartland St. Clair MacDougall (brother of George Campbell MacDougall) and James St. George Bellhouse, of the firm of Bellhouse &amp; Dillon. Lady Allan died in Montreal in June 1881, aged 53.

They were the parents of nine daughters and four sons, including:
*Alexander Rea Allan (2 Aug 1845 – 29 Jun 1901), who &quot;was not cut out for business&quot;. He married Eva Belford Travers, daughter of John N. Travers and a niece of General James Travers, V.C. The couple lived with their son, (Hugh) Travers, at 112 King Street in Brockville, Ontario, where he managed the Bank of Montreal office.
* Elizabeth Allan (9 Oct 1847 - 12 June 1921) married Asst-Surgeon (later Brigade-Surgeon) George Carson Gribbon, MB (1836-1894) in May 1867 while his regiment, the 25th (King&#x27;s Own Borderers) Regiment of Foot, was garrisoned in Montreal. They had five children.
* Jane Crawford Allan (9 July 1849- 6 May 1931), married 21 Oct 1867, Asst-Surgeon (later Major) Thomas Dodd Milburne, whose regiment, the 13th Hussars, was stationed in Canada from 1866 to 1869.
* Phoebe Mary Allan (1852–1904), married on March 1, 1877, Sir George Lauderdale Houstoun-Boswall, 3rd Bart., grandson of General Sir William Houston, 1st Baronet. Lady Houstoun-Boswall was the mother of one daughter and two sons.
* Matilda Isabella Allan (1854–1932), died unmarried.
* Florence Adelaide Allan (1857–1942), married businessman Alfred H. White of Quebec City, and following his death, Major General J.F. Wilson. The White daughters, Gladys and Eileen, both married sons of John Ogilvie, brother of William Watson Ogilvie and one of the founders of Ogilvie Mills. Gladys married Capt.(later Brig. Gen.) Alexander Thomas Ogilvie, and Eileen married realtor Douglas Watson Ogilvie. Dorothy White married Montreal lawyer, John Wilson Cook.
* Margaret Macfie Allan (1858–1939), married veterinarian Dr. Charles McEachran (1864–1919) of Montreal.
*Sir Montagu Allan (1860–1951), vice-chairman of the Allan Line, President of the Merchants Bank. Principal heir of his father, he inherited Ravenscrag and married, in 1893, Marguerite Ethel Mackenzie. Their four children, including Martha Allan, predeceased them.
* Bryce James Allan (1862–1924), managed the Allan Line from Boston. He was educated at Bishop&#x27;s College School and in France and Germany. He lived at &quot;Allanbank&quot; near Boston (now known as Tupper Manor and part of Endicott College). In 1896, he married Anna, daughter of General Francis Winthrop Palfrey of Boston.
* Edythe Maud Allan (1863–1946), married (James) Turner Routledge (d. 1899). They purchased one of her father&#x27;s farms, &quot;Belmere&quot; in Georgetown, Quebec, and were the parents of two sons, Lieut. Allan (d. 1916) and Maj. James Colin (d. 1977).
* Mabel Gertrude Allan (1867–1955), married Colin Augustus Monk Campbell (1860–1926), Seigneur de Rouville. He was the son of Major Thomas Edmund Campbell and Henriette-Julie, daughter of Captain Michel-Louis Juchereau Duchesnay. They lived at Manoir Rouville-Campbell in St. Hilaire, Quebec. Two children survived infancy: Enid Margaret (Mrs. Joseph C. Wray), and Phoebe Duchesnay.
* Arthur Edward Allan (1871–1893), died young in an accidental fire.

==Final years==
In 1871, Allan was created a Knight Bachelor by Queen Victoria for his services in connection with the development of ocean steam navigation in Canada. In December 1882, not long after the death of his wife, he died in Edinburgh while visiting his son-in-law, Sir George Houstoun-Boswall.

At his death, he was one of the richest men in the world, with a fortune estimated to be between £8 million and £12 million pounds. His remains were brought back to Montreal, and he was buried with his family at the Mount Royal Cemetery. The Allan family&#x27;s Canadian enterprises, almost entirely built by Hugh, were continued by his brother, Andrew Allan.

<doc id="350058" wikidata="Q703849" url="?curid=350058" title="Arthur Janov">
<text>Arthur Janov (; August 21, 1924October 1, 2017), also known as Art Janov, was an American psychologist, psychotherapist, and writer. He gained notability as the creator of primal therapy, a treatment for mental illness that involves repeatedly descending into, feeling, and experiencing long-repressed childhood pain. Janov first directed a psychotherapy institute called the Primal Institute on North Almont Dr. in West Hollywood, California and from 1980 at the Janov Primal Center at 1205 Abbot Kinney Boulevard, in Venice, Los Angeles and latterly on Ashland Avenue in Santa Monica, California.

Janov was the author of many books, most notably &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; (1970), as well as &quot;The Biology of Love&quot; and &quot;Life Before Birth: The Hidden Script That Rules our Lives&quot;.

==Early life==
Arthur Janov was born in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in Boyle Heights, a low income neighborhood east of Downtown L.A., populated mainly by Jews, Latinos, and Slavic immigrants. Janov was the son of two Russian-Jewish immigrants, Conrad Janov and Anne Coretsky-Janov. He received his B.A. and M.S.W. in psychiatric social work from the University of California, Los Angeles, and his Ph.D. in psychology from Claremont Graduate School in 1960.

==Career==
Janov originally practiced conventional psychotherapy in his native California. He did an internship at the Hacker Psychiatric Clinic in Beverly Hills, worked for the Veterans&#x27; Administration at Brentwood Neuropsychiatric Hospital and was in private practice from 1952 until his death in 2017. He was also on the staff of the Psychiatric Department at Los Angeles Children&#x27;s Hospital where he was involved in developing their psychosomatic unit.

In Janov&#x27;s view, the repressed pain of traumatic childhood experiences eventually produces an emotionally damaged adult. These experiences include not only obvious physical and psychological injuries, but also subtle slights like parents&#x27; failure to comfort a child.

Janov wrote that his professional life changed in a single day in 1967 with the discovery of what he called &quot;Primal Pain&quot;. During a therapy session, Janov heard what he describes as, &quot;an eerie scream welling up from the depths of a young man lying on the floor&quot;. He developed primal therapy, in which clients are encouraged to re-live and express what Janov considered repressed memories and feelings.

Janov&#x27;s primal therapy became a cultural phenomenon in the 1970s and 1980s along with his work &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; (1970). In response to criticism claiming that primal therapy is discredited and harmful, Janov said in 2016: &quot;We have 50 years of published material to the contrary. We have several scientific articles in the journal Activitas Nervosa Superior, plus other journals. We do serious science and leave the nonsense to others&quot;.

The idea of &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; came when one of his patients told of a theatrical performance at Conway Hall, London, in which Raphael Montañez Ortiz dressed in diapers shouted &quot;Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!&quot; throughout the act, then vomited, distributing plastic bags to the spectators and later asking them to vomit as well. Janov was fascinated by this and asked his patient to cry for his own &quot;mommy&quot; and &quot;daddy&quot;.

However, Janov&#x27;s primal therapy was the source of controversy, with allegations that Janov used the treatment as a &quot;cash-grab scheme&quot;. In response, Janov stated that &quot;We take no salaries and no profits and have not in years. We have paid several hundred thousand dollars for research to maintain our scientific integrity. We fund therapy for those who cannot afford it&quot;.

==Influence on popular music==
Janov&#x27;s patients included the musicians John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Janov&#x27;s ideas had a significant impact on &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot;, Lennon&#x27;s first solo album after The Beatles, which centers themes of parental abandonment and psychological suffering and served to popularize primal scream therapy.

Two important bands formed in the early 1980s, Tears for Fears and Primal Scream, took their names from Janov&#x27;s work. The influence on Tears for Fears is strongest on their first album &quot;The Hurting&quot; (including &quot;Mad World&quot; and &quot;Ideas as Opiates,&quot; which is named for a chapter in Janov&#x27;s &quot;Prisoners of Pain&quot;) and in their No. 1 single &quot;Shout&quot; from &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot;. The band eventually met Janov in 1986 and became disillusioned with him and his work.

==Personal life==
Janov was first married to Vivian Glickstein in 1949, but they separated in 1975 and divorced in 1980 so that he could remarry. He married France Daunic four months later in 1980 and was still married to her at the time of his death. Janov had two children from his first marriage – Rick Janov, a primal therapist, and Ellen Janov, a singer and actress who died in 1976 – and an adopted son, Xavier, from his second marriage.

On October 1, 2017, Janov died in his sleep at the age of 93 of respiratory arrest complicated by a stroke. For several years, Janov suffered from a throat disease which limited his ability to speak. At the time of his death, he was living in Malibu, California.

<text>The jack snipe or jacksnipe (Lymnocryptes minimus) is a small stocky wader. It is the smallest snipe, and the only member of the genus Lymnocryptes. Features such as its sternum and its continuous &#x27;bobbing up and down&#x27; make it quite distinct from other snipes or woodcocks.

==Taxonomy==
The jack snipe was formally described in 1764 by the Danish zoologist Morten Thrane Brünnich under the binomial name &quot;Scolopax minima&quot;. He specified the type locality as the Danish island of Christiansø. Brünnich based his account on &quot;La petite béccassine&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The jack snipe is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Lymnocryptes&quot; that was introduced in 1826 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name &quot;Lymnocryptes&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;limne&quot;, &quot;marsh&quot; and &quot;kruptos&quot;, &quot;hidden&quot;. The species name &quot; minimus &quot; is from Latin and means &quot;smallest&quot;.

The common name has been said to come from the Welsh word for a snipe, &quot;giach&quot; (pronounced with a hard &quot;g&quot;), but modern dictionaries say it comes from the masculine name Jack. Alfred Newton hypothesized that, &quot;It may be, as in Jackass, an indication of sex, for it is a popular belief that the Jack-Snipe is the male of the common species; or, again, it may refer to the comparatively small size of the bird, as the &#x27;jack&#x27; in the game of bowls is the smallest of the balls used, and as fishermen call the smaller Pikes Jacks.&quot;

==Description==

Adults are smaller than common snipes and have relatively shorter bills. The bird&#x27;s length is , wingspan is and weight is . The body is mottled brown on top and pale underneath. Jack snipes have a dark stripe through the eye. The wings are pointed and narrow, and yellow back stripes are visible in flight. When seen, the distinctive bobbing movement, as if the bird is on springs, has an almost hypnotic quality.

The head pattern of the jack snipe differs from the common snipe and other species in the genus &quot;Gallinago&quot;, in that there is no central crown-stripe; instead, there are two pale lateral crown-stripes, which are separated from the supercilium by an area of dark plumage.

==Distribution and habitat==
Jack snipes are migratory, spending the non-breeding period in Great Britain, Atlantic and Mediterranean coastal Europe, Africa, and India. The jack snipe is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Their breeding habitat is marshes, bogs, tundra and wet meadows with short vegetation in northern Europe and northern Russia.

==Behaviour==

Jack snipes can be secretive in their non-breeding areas and are difficult to observe, being well camouflaged in their habitat. Consequently, birdwatchers have developed a specialised technique for finding them. This involves walking through its marshy habitat until a bird is disturbed and flies up. Jack snipes will squat down and not flush from cover until an intruder is quite close. They then quietly fly a short distance before dropping back into vegetation.

===Feeding===
They forage in soft mud, probing or picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and earthworms, also plant material.

===Breeding===
The male performs an aerial display during courtship, during which it makes a distinctive sound like a galloping horse. It is silent in winter. They nest in a well-hidden location on the ground, laying 3–4 eggs.
