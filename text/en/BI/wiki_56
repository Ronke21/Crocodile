<text>Banská Štiavnica (; ; , ) is a town in central Slovakia, in the middle of an immense caldera created by the collapse of an ancient volcano. For its size, the caldera is known as the Štiavnica Mountains. Banská Štiavnica has a population of more than 10,000. It is a completely preserved medieval town. Because of their historical value, the town and its surroundings were proclaimed by the UNESCO to be a World Heritage Site on December 11, 1993.

==History==
The fate of Banská Štiavnica has been closely linked to the exploitation of its abundant resources of silver ore. According to evidence from excavations, the site was settled during the Neolithic period.

The first mining settlement was founded by Celts in the 3rd century BC. It was probably occupied by the Celtic Cotini tribe. Roman authors mentioned mining activities of the Cotini, who had lived in present-day central Slovakia until they were deported to Pannonia within the Marcomannic Wars by Rome. The site was also settled by early Hungarians and an old Hungarian fortified settlement was situated here in the 10th and 11th century. The site was called “terra banensium” (the land of miners) as early as 1156. The local Slavic population gave the name „Štiavnica“ (acidic stream) to the settlement in the valley, and the settlement on the hill above (Ligotavá hora, or Glanzenberg – the shiny mountain) came to be called „Bánya“ (the mine). The single common name „Schebnyzbana“ was documented for the first time in 1255. The local Slavic population was joined by skilled German settlers who started arriving in the 13th century. They adapted the local name to the German &quot;Schemnitz&quot;. Banská Štiavnica gained the status of a royal town in 1238, as one of the first towns in the Kingdom of Hungary.

In the High and Late Middle Ages, the town was the main producer of silver and gold in the Kingdom of Hungary. During the Ottoman Wars, the Turks made concerted efforts to conquer rich mining towns in Upper Hungary (Banská Štiavnica, Banská Bystrica, and Kremnica). This new threat led Banská Štiavnica to build powerful fortifications, including two castles, in the 16th century. As one of the most important centers of the Protestant Reformation in the country, the town belonged to the Protestant &quot;League of Seven Mining Towns&quot; together with Banská Belá, Banská Bystrica, Kremnica, Ľubietová, Nová Baňa, and Pukanec.
The town was also a leading center of innovation in the mining industry. In 1627, gunpowder was used there in a mine for one of the first times in the world (After Le Thillot, France). To drain water from the flooded mines, a sophisticated system of water reservoirs and channels, known as tajchy, was designed and built by the local scientists Jozef Karol Hell, Maximilian Hell, and Samuel Mikovíny in the 18th century. Tajchy not only saved the mines from being closed, but also provided energy for the early phase of industrialization.

Its Mining Academy, founded there in 1735 by Samuel Mikovíny, was the first mining school in the Kingdom of Hungary. Beginning in 1763, the Hofkammer in Vienna, with support from Queen Maria Theresa, transformed the school into the Academy of Mining. In 1807, a Forestry Institute was &quot;established under the decision of Emperor Franz I&quot;; in 1848 the school was renamed the Academy of Mining and Forestry, &#x27;the first technical university in the world&#x27;. In 1919, after the creation of Czechoslovakia, the Academy was moved to Sopron in Hungary. The student traditions of the Academy (School traditions of Selmec) are still living in its successors, the University of Miskolc and Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, and colleges in Sopron, Székesfehérvár, and Dunaújváros.

In 1782, Banská Štiavnica was the third biggest town in the Kingdom of Hungary (with 23,192 or incl. suburbs 40,000 inhabitants), after Pozsony (today Bratislava) and Debrecen. But the town&#x27;s development was too closely linked to the mining activity which had been progressively declining since the second half of the 19th century. Nowadays, Banská Štiavnica is an important center of recreation and tourism, benefiting from its rich historical heritage.

During World War II, Banská Štiavnica was taken by Soviet troops of the 53rd Army on 7 March 1945.

==Landmarks==

The heart of the town is the historical Trinity Square () dominated by a monumental plague column. The square is used for frequent cultural events and there is also a mineralogical museum. 
Two castles, the so-called “old” one (Slovak: &quot;Starý zámok&quot;) and “new” one (Slovak: &quot;Nový zámok&quot;), have been transformed into museums.

The open air mining museum offers a long underground excursion in mines dating from the 17th century. Visitors will receive helmets, cloaks and lamps to use during the tour. It is also possible to have an English, German or Hungarian speaking guide if this is requested in advance. Another ancient mine open to the public (Slovak: &quot;Glanzenberg&quot;) is even older. This mine, situated just under the center of the town, has attracted numerous famous visitors, from Emperor Joseph II to Prince Albert of Monaco.

The town is surrounded by ancient artificial mining water reservoirs called &quot;tajchy&quot;. Sixty reservoirs were built in the 15th through 18th centuries in order to provide energy for the booming mining industry. They are connected by a more than long network of channels. These extraordinary historical monuments are now used mainly for recreation.
==Churches==
* St. Catherine&#x27;s Church
In Kalvária Banská Štiavnica there is a complex of churches and chapels near &quot;Ostry vrch&quot; which was built in the eighteenth century by the Jesuits.

==Demographics==
dBanská Štiavnica has a population of 10,674 (as of December 31, 2005). According to the 2001 census, 93.9% of inhabitants were Slovaks and 2% Romani people. Many people are descendants of the Carpathian Germans, who played a very important role in the medieval history of the town. The religious makeup was 65% Roman Catholics, 18.9% people with no religious affiliation, and 7.6% Lutherans.

<text>Nové Zámky (; ) is a town in Nové Zámky District in the Nitra Region of southwestern Slovakia.

==Geography==
The town is located on the Danubian Lowland, on the Nitra River, at an altitude of 119 metres. It is located around 100 km from Bratislava and around 25 km from the Hungarian border. It is a road and railway hub of southern Slovakia.

The town lies in the temperate zone and has a continental climate. Annual average temperature reaches around , with the warmest month being July with an average of and the coldest January with . Average annual precipitation is 556 mm.

==History==

The town has a distinguished history. From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. A fortress was built as a defence against the Ottoman Empire, on the site of an older settlement in the years 1573–81. Between 1589 and 1663, the settlement was the seat of the Captaincy of Lower Hungary. The town developed around the fortress. The huge new fortress was one of the most modern in Europe when it was built, a prime example of the star fortress which was considered to be adapted to the advance in artillery in the preceding centuries. (In fact, the Hungarian name means &quot;the archbishop&#x27;s new castle&quot;.)

The Ottomans failed to conquer it six times (except Ottoman rule between 1566–1595 and 1605–1606), but in 1663 they managed to do so. It was made the center of an Ottoman eyalet in present-day southern Slovakia – with the subordinate sanjaks of Litra, Leve, Novigrad, Holok, Bukabak and Şefradi (probably Šahy).

The saying &quot;Strong as an Ottoman in front of Nové Zámky&quot;, which means working with determination and stability, reflects the memory of conquest determination of the Ottomans.

In 1685 it was conquered by the imperial troops of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Six years later, it received town privileges from the Esztergom archbishop.

The town also played an important role in many anti-Habsburg uprisings in the northern parts of Royal Hungary in the 17th century. Emperor Charles VI had it razed in 1724–1725, to prevent potential further insurrections which would use the fortress as their base.

After the break-up of Austria-Hungary in 1918/1920, the town became part of the newly created Czechoslovakia. As a result of the First Vienna Award, it was occupied by Hungary between 1938 and 1945.

After the Germans occupied Hungary in March 1944, the deportation of Hungarian Jewry to Auschwitz began. The town’s Jews were concentrated in a temporary ghetto. On June 12 and 15, 1944, two transports of Jews were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. The entire local Jewry was deported; few survived.

During World War II (1944), the town was heavily damaged by bombings of the Allies. Only small parts of the fortress are still standing today. It is, however, still depicted on the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

==Culture==

===Museums===
The Ernest Zmeták Art Gallery on Björnsonova Street has two permanent exhibitions. The first one, called &quot;European Art of the 16th to 20th Century″, is based on the donation of a local painter and collector, Ernest Zmeták. The second one presents the works of art of a local Hungarian avant-garde artist and writer, Lajos Kassák.

===Synagogue===
The orthodox synagogue is located at Česká bašta and dates from 1880. After reconstruction in 1992 it was registered as a historic landmark of Slovakia. It is one of only four synagogues in Slovakia (in Bratislava, Košice, Bardejov and Nové Zámky) that are used for religious purposes by the local Jewish community.

===Franciscan church and monastery===
:&quot;see Franciscan church and monastery, Nové Zámky&quot;

The Franciscan church and monastery was built in the early baroque style in the middle of the 17th century. The complex was renovated in the 18th and at the end of the 19th century.

==Demographics==
The 2001 census recorded a population of 42,262 people, with 69.67% of them being Slovaks, 27.52% Hungarians and others. The most widespread religion was Roman Catholicism (71.72%), followed by a group without denomination (17.75%) and Evangelics (Lutherans) (3.36%).

<doc id="349040" wikidata="Q202598" url="?curid=349040" title="Váh">
<text>The Váh (; , ; ; ) is the longest river within Slovakia. Towns on the river include Liptovský Hrádok, Liptovský Mikuláš, Ružomberok, Vrútky, Žilina, Bytča, Považská Bystrica, Púchov, Ilava, Dubnica nad Váhom, Nemšová, Trenčín, Nové Mesto nad Váhom, Piešťany, Hlohovec, Sereď, Šaľa, Kolárovo and Komárno.

==Etymology==
The name is of Germanic or Slavic origin. It could be derived from old Germanic &quot;wȃg&quot; (stream) or proto-Slavic &quot;vagъ&quot;, &quot;vaga&quot; (pole, stick, carved branch) referring to reinforced riverbanks. Several Slavic river names with a similar motivation exist, but pre-Slavic origin of larger rivers in Slovakia is assumed in general. The earliest mentions are &quot;flumen Vvaga&quot; (1111) and &quot;aqua Vvac&quot;&#x27; (1113).

==Geography==
A left tributary of the Danube river, the Váh is long, including its Čierny Váh branch. Its two sources, the &quot;Biely Váh&quot; (White Váh) and the &quot;Čierny Váh&quot; (Black Váh), are located in the Vysoké Tatry (High Tatras) and Nízke Tatry (Low Tatra) mountains, respectively, and it flows over northern and western Slovakia and finally feeds into the Danube near Komárno. The left tributaries are Demänovka, Revúca, Ľubochnianka, Turiec, Rajčanka and Nitra rivers, and the right tributaries are Belá, Orava, Varínka, Kysuca, Biela voda, Vlára, Dubová, Dudváh and Malý Dunaj rivers. In late medieval time it was a property of Stibor of Stiboricz and his son Stibor of Beckov of the Clan of Ostoja, later passing to Maurice Benyovszky as a gift of Maria Theresa.

It includes canals, artificial dams (Čierny Váh, Liptovská Mara, Bešeňová, Krpeľany, Žilina, Hričov, Nosice, Sĺňava, Madunice, Kráľová and Selice) and 16 hydropower stations, whose construction started in the 1930s and increased after World War II. The main Slovak limited-access motorway is along the Váh (Bratislava – Trenčín – Považská Bystrica – Žilina and Ružomberok – Poprad), as well as the main railway Bratislava – Žilina – Košice.

<text>Gömör (, , , Latin: &quot;Gömörinum&quot;) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. In the 19th century, and in the beginning of the 20th century, it was united with the Kis-Hont County to form Gömör-Kishont County. Its territory is located in southern Slovakia and northern Hungary. Today names Gömör/Gemer are only an informal designation of the corresponding territory without administrative role.

==Geography==
Gemer region is situated in Slovenské rudohorie approximately between the present-day Slovak-Hungarian border, the towns Poltár and Rožňava and the Low Tatras (Nízke Tatry). It borders traditional regions Spiš to the North, Abov to the East, Borsod to the South, Heves to the South-West, Novohrad to the west, and Zvolen and Liptov regions at North-West.

The river Slaná (Sajó) flows through Gemer from North to the South.

Gömör és Kishont County was covering area of 4,289 km2 in 1910.

==Capitals==
The capital of Gömör region was originally Gömör Castle, after which it was named, and from the early 18th century Pelsőc (Plešivec) town. After merging with Kis-Hont region, Rimaszombat (Rimavská Sobota) became new centre of region. Cultural centres of region include Rožňava, Rimavská Sobota and Revúca.

==History==

Gömör is one of the oldest counties of the Kingdom of Hungary, and it was already mentioned in the 11th century. The territory approximately between the towns Tiszolc and Rimaszombat, called Kis-Hont was merged with Gemer from 1786 until 1790, and again in 1802. After that, it was called Gömör-Kishont. Southern parts of region were occupied and ruled by Ottomans between 1553 and 1686 as part of Sandjak of Novigrad) and Sandjak of Holok) in Budin Eyalet and Uyvar eyalet.

History of Gömör is connected with several noble families, including Ákos family, Bebek family, Csetneki family, Mariássy family, Koháry family, Coburg family and the Andrássy family.

Gömör played also important part in Slovak National Revival, as many Slovak intellectuals were born or living in the region. The first Slovak high school teaching in Slovak was opened in Nagyrőce in 1862.

In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon most of the county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, except 7.5% of its area around Putnok, which became temporarily part of the Hungarian county of Borsod-Gömör-Kishont.

After First Vienna Award in 1938, most of region became part of Hungary and the Gömör-Kishont County was recreated. This situation lasted until the end of the war, when First Vienna Award was reverted and 92.5% of the area became part of Czechoslovakia again.
Nowadays, the Slovak part of Gemer and Malohont is situated in two Slovak administrative regions: Banská Bystrica Region and Košice Region. Hungarian part of former Gömör County is situated in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County. In Hungary the name of Gömör is now preserved only in the name of a small village, Gömörszőlős, the Gömör Museum in Putnok, and in that of Gömöri station, the smaller railway station of Miskolc. In Slovakia it is still being commonly used, but only as informal name of the region without administrative independence. However, it is one of Slovak Regions of tourism, as &quot;Gemerský región cestovného ruchu&quot; (Gemer Tourist Region).

== Economy ==

Historically, Gömör and Kis-Hont was very rich because of its rich mineral and ore deposits. Mining took place here yet in the Neolithic. Various minerals were mined here, including iron ores, copper or gold. Evidence of the region&#x27;s past wealth is the number of mansions and palaces, and many preserved medieval churches with quality frescoes.

Thanks to the wealth from mines, most villages in Gömör could already in Middle Ages afford to have their own stone church. In 14th Century many of them were decorated with frescoes by Italian masters and by their local disciples.

Big credit on development of mining in Gömör in Late modern period had noble family Andrássy, notably count Manó Andrássy, who had built several ore mills, thanks to what he was called &quot;Iron Count&quot;. Gradually most of the mines and plants in the region were taken over by &quot;Rimamurány-Salgótarjáni Vasmű Részvénytársaság&quot; (Rimamurán-Salgotarján Ironworks Company). In that time, there was a massive development, mining colonies with quality housing for miners and administrative workers were built, and miners, despite hard work, had cultural and technological advantages that most of inhabitants did not yet have at the time.

However, in 20th century glory and wealth of the region gradually declined. This had several reasons. Ore deposits gradually emptied, and used technologies became obsolete. After the Treaty of Trianon, region which used to be near centre of country became periphery. In addition, mining companies, which had been already declining before the disintegration of Hungarian Kingdom suddenly gained new rivals from Bohemia.

Another decline followed the fall of socialism and privatizations in 1990s. Mining still continues at some locations, but only in limited extent.

Modern employers in the region include Slovenské Magnezitové Závody Jelšava and SLOVMAG Lubeník, which mine magnetite, paper mills SHP Slavošovce and producer of mineral water Gemerka.

Nowadays, Gemer region is one of the poorest regions of Slovakia. Many young people leaves it for other regions of Slovakia or go to foreign countries.

== Demographics ==
Historically, Gömör is associated with three ethnic groups: Hungarians, Germans and Slovaks. After the emergence of the Kingdom of Hungary, Gömör became multi-ethnical. As part of settlement policies, many settlers from Germany came to work in mines in the Middle Ages. The names of some villages still refer to German colonization, i.e. Ochtiná (from bavarian &quot;ocht –&quot; eight&quot;)&quot;. The number of Germans in the region decreased after the war and after the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Nowadays, Gemer is populated primarily by Slovaks (mainly Upper Gemer) and by Hungarians (notably Lower Gemer) and by Romani people.

== Religion ==

Most of villages and towns have Lutheran churches. It&#x27;s a relic of German colonisation, as German inhabitants brought Lutheranism to Gemer from German schools. On the south, notably amongst Hungarian population prevails Calvinism of Reformed Christian Church. However, in some villages, Roman Catholic faith remained. It is common in Gemer, that many villages and towns have several churches of different denominations.

In recent years, the number of active believers has decreased significantly. Many parishes had been united and are being served by a single pastor. There are no longer regular masses in many churches in region.

== Tourism ==
Despite its current poverty, because of its former wealth, Gömör has an interesting history, many historical monuments and authentic wild nature. In recent years, its popularity among tourists has been increasing, despite the lack of infrastructure.

Historical monuments in region include many medieval churches with Gothic frescoes, including the biggest rotunda in Central Europe in Süvete. Since most of the Gömör churches were in early modern period taken by Lutherans, who used to paint frescoes over by whitewash, much more frescoes was preserved in Gömör, than in other regions of Slovakia and of the entire former Kingdom of Hungary, at all. Gothic churches in Gemer are nowadays part of Gothic Route (Gotická Cesta), project of touristic route connecting the most valuable medieval churches. In 2020, most valuable frescoes in 12 medieval churches in Gemer had been nominated for European Heritage Label.Probably the most popular historical monument in Gömör is the chateau in Betlér, monumental manor house of the Andrássy family. Today it is part of the Slovak National Museum. It is the only chateau in Slovakia with fully preserved original furniture and equipment. Other sights include the Krásna Hôrka Castle (closed due to reconstruction), Andrássy family mausoleum near Krásnohorské Podhradie and Muráň Castle, which is the third highest placed castle in Slovakia, known from many legends.

Many tourists visit Gemer because of its caves. There are more than a thousand caves, which are part of UNESCO World Heritage as Caves of Aggtelek Karst and Slovak Karst. They may be visited in both Slovakia and Hungary.

In recent times, more and more people visit Gemer because of its technical monuments. These include iron-mills in Nižná Slaná (Huta Etelka) and in Vlachovo (Huta Karol), a never finished system of freely accessible railway tunnels and bridge in Slavošovce and in Manezitovce known as Gemerské spojky.

There are many museums as well, the Mining Museum in Rožňava, Gemersko-Malohontské múzeum (Gemer-Malohont Museum) in Rimavská Sobota, Gömöri Múzeum in Putnok and Mining Expositions in Rákoš and in Nižná Slaná.

Natural attractions of Gemer are National Park Muránska Planina, national protected reservation Zádielská tiesňava, known for its valley. Hikers visit Volovec-Skalisko hill above Betliar. A tourist destination, especially in spring, is the village Brdárka known for its cherry orchards and Baroque church.

Another tourist destination is Dobinšký kopec (Dobšiná Hill), which has views of Dobšiná town and is used for hillclimbing races.

<text>Spiš ( ; or ; ) is a region in north-eastern Slovakia, with a very small area in south-eastern Poland (more specifically encompassing 14 villages). Spiš is an informal designation of the territory, but it is also the name of one of the 21 official tourism regions of Slovakia. The region is not an administrative division in its own right, but between the late 11th century and 1920 it was an administrative county of the Kingdom of Hungary (see separate article Szepes County in this regard).

==Etymology==
The name is probably related to the appellative &quot;spiška&quot;, &quot;špiška&quot; known from Slovak (Eastern Slovakia and Orava) and Moravian dialects (Haná) - a (cut) stick, a piece of wood or sugar, etc. Old Slavic &quot;pьchjati&quot;, &quot;pichjati&quot; - to stab, to cut → prefixed form sъ-pich-jь → after palatalization and extinction of yers &quot;spiš&quot;. Spiš probably means &quot;a cut forest&quot;. The theory is supported also by the fact that almost all early Latin documents mention Spiš as &quot;silva Zepus&quot; (or with similar transcription) - the name of forest area.

Another theory is a derivation from Hungarian – nice, beautiful → Szepes. However, according to Šimon Ondruš this etymology is linguistically impossible. The Slovak and the Polish name could not be derived from Hungarian Szepes because the combination &quot;consonant-e-consonant-e-consonant&quot; is valid and common in Slovak (but also in other Slavic languages) without any need for phonetic adaptation and similar changes are not documented. On the other hand, the assumed phonetic adaptation Slavic &quot;Spiš&quot; → Hungarian &quot;Szepes&quot; depends on well known changes in the Hungarian language like vowel insertion (i.e. Slepčany → Szelepcsény) and vowel harmonization.

==Geography==
The region is situated between the High Tatras and the Dunajec River in the north, the springs of the Váh River in the west, the Slovenské rudohorie Mountains (Slovak Ore Mountains) and Hnilec River in the south, and a line running from the town of Stará Ľubovňa, via the Branisko mountain (under which lies the 4,822 m long Branisko Tunnel, currently the longest in Slovakia), to the town of Margecany in the east. The core of the Spiš region is formed by the basins of the rivers Hornád and Poprad, and the High Tatra Mountains. Throughout its history, the territory has been characterized by a large percentage of forests - in the late 19th century, as much as 42.2% of Spiš was forest.

==History==

===Early history===

&quot;The history of the region until 1920 is given in more detail at Szepes County.&quot;

Traces of settlement in the Neanderthal era have been found in remains at Gánovce (Gánóc) and Bešeňová (Besenyőfalu).

The territory of Spiš was later populated first by Celts. It belonged to the state of Great Moravia (Veľká Morava), and after its dissolution became part of Poland.

The southern part of the territory was conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary at the end of the 11th century, when the border of the Kingdom ended near the modern town of Kežmarok. The royal county of Szepes (&quot;comitatus Scepusiensis&quot;) was created in the 2nd half of the 12th century. In the 1250s the border of the Kingdom of Hungary shifted to the north to Podolínec and in 1260 even further to the north (the Dunajec River). The northeastern region around Hniezdne and Stará Ľubovňa, the so-called &quot;districtus Podoliensis&quot;, was incorporated only in the 1290s. The northern border of the county stabilized in the early 14th century. Around 1300, the royal county became a noble county.

Many of the towns of Spiš developed from German colonization. The German settlers had been invited to the territory from the mid-12th century onwards. The settlements founded by them in southern Spiš were mainly mining settlements (later towns). Consequently, until World War II Spiš had a large German population (called Zipsers; see Carpathian Germans) who spoke Zipser German; now, the only Zipser-speaking town is Chmeľnica (Hopgarten). Many smaller settlements were populated by settlers from Poland.
In 1412, under the Treaty of Lubowla, 16 towns, two castles and a number of villages in Spiš were pawned to Poland by Sigismund of Luxembourg to finance his wars with the Republic of Venice in Dalmatia. Among the towns that for 360 years belonged to Poland were: Stará Ľubovňa, Podolínec, Spišská Sobota, Poprad and Spišská Nová Ves. In 1772 all were annexed by the Habsburg monarchy.

In 1868, 21 Spiš settlements sent their demands, the &#x27;Spiš Petition&#x27;, to the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary, requesting special status for Slovaks within the Kingdom.

===Spiš after the creation of Czechoslovakia===
In 1918 (and confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920), the county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia. A tiny part of the territory (situated in today&#x27;s Poland below the Rysy), amounting to 195 km2 after an internal border dispute had been confirmed to be part of Galicia (Central Europe) (at that time the western part of Austria-Hungary) as early as 1902. After World War I northern Spiš was united with Poland and became the subject of a long-running border dispute between Poland and Czechoslovakia. In 1923 Slovak Spiš was divided between the newly formed Sub-Tatra county (&quot;Podtatranská župa&quot;) and Košice county (&quot;Коšická župa&quot;). In 1928-1939 and 1945-1948 it was part of the newly created Slovak Land (&quot;Slovenská krajina&quot;).

During World War II, when Czechoslovakia was divided, Spiš was part of independent Slovakia, and formed the eastern part of Tatra county (&quot;Tatranská župa&quot;) from 1940 to 1945. Slovakia joined the Axis, and the Polish part of Spiš (together with the Polish part of the county of Orava) was transferred to Slovakia. During the war all the Jews of the area were deported or murdered. When Soviet forces
approached from the east at the end of 1944, most of the ethnic Germans in Spiš fled westward, between mid-November 1944 and 21 January 1945 (see also Carpathian Germans). Their property was confiscated after the war (see Beneš decrees).

After World War II the prewar borders of Spiš were restored, with most of the county going to Czechoslovakia, and a small part to Poland. In 1948, it became part of the newly created Košice Region (&quot;Košický kraj &quot;) and Prešov Region (&quot;Prešovský kraj&quot;), whose borders however were completely different from those of the present-day regions of the same name. From July 1960 it became part of the newly created Eastern Slovak region (&quot;Východoslovenský kraj&quot;), which ceased to exist in September 1990.

In 1993, Czechoslovakia was split and Spiš became part of Slovakia.

==Nationalities==
According to censuses carried out in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1869 (and later in 1900 and 1910) the population of Szepes county comprised the following nationalities: Slovaks 50.4%, (58.2%, 58%), Germans 35% (25%, 25%), Carpatho-Rusyns 13.8% (8.4%, 8%) and 0.7% (6%, 6%) Magyars (Hungarians).

The current ethnic composition of the region, however, is much different. As mentioned above, many Jews and ethnic Germans were removed or left during World War II.

Present-day Spiš has a number of Romani settlements and Romani are a substantial minority there.

There are also 40,000-48,000 Gorals (Slovak: &quot;Gorali&quot;; literally Highlanders). Although a negligible number in census terms, they are a distinctive minority with their own culture, and speak a dialect of Polish (or Slovak-Polish dialect continuum by some considered a language), especially elders. They consider themselves as Slovaks and, in present, speak mostly Slovak language. Official Slovak 2011&#x27;s census reported only 3084 Poles living in Slovakia.

== Religion ==
In Spiš are the biggest and oldest churches such as a Roman Catholic Church and Evangelical Church of Augsburg Confession (Lutherans). In the year 1600 the biggest church was the Evangelical Church. Currently, the biggest church is the Roman Catholic Church.

==Economy==
Historically, economic activity in the region has been based principally on agriculture and forestry (formerly mining, too), which explains why Spiš belongs to the relatively poor regions of Slovakia. Since the late 19th century, tourism has helped the local economy, and sanatoria and winter sports resorts have been built in the High Tatras and the Low Tatras, and areas such as the Slovak Paradise (&quot;Slovenský raj&quot;) in the south-west and the Pieniny National Park at the Slovak-Polish border. Other tourist destinations include the region&#x27;s historical sites like Spiš Castle and nearby Spišské Podhradie, Spišská Kapitula, Žehra and the town of Levoča (all of which are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites), Kežmarok, and Stará Ľubovňa Castle. The tourism industry has developed rapidly in Spiš, aided by the introduction of regular flights to Poprad Airport and improving rail and road connections.

==Spiš today==
Spiš today is one of Slovakia&#x27;s 21 tourist regions but, unlike its predecessor, is not an administrative region.

Since 1996, Spiš has been divided between the modern Košice Region and Prešov Region and is covered approximately by the following six administrative districts: Poprad, Kežmarok, Stará Ľubovňa, Spišská Nová Ves, Levoča and Gelnica, except for the eastern half of the Stará Ľubovňa District that had been within Saris county and three villages of the Poprad district (Štrba including Tatranská Štrba, Štrbské Pleso and Liptovská Teplička from Liptov county.)

The present population of the Spiš region is about 320,000; almost half the population lives in towns, the largest of which are Poprad (55,000), Spišská Nová Ves (39,000) and Kežmarok (17,000).

<text>Liptó County (, , , , ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in northern Slovakia.

==Geography==
Liptó county shared borders with the Austrian land Galicia and the Hungarian counties Árva, Turóc, Zólyom, Gömör-Kishont and Szepes. The county&#x27;s territory was situated along the upper Vág (present-day Váh) river between the High Tatras and the Low Tatras. Its area was 2,247 km2 around 1910.

Today, the territory of the former Liptó County largely corresponds to the Ružomberok District and Liptovský Mikuláš District in northern Slovakia. Three villages (Liptovská Teplička, Štrba and Štrbské Pleso) are now in the Poprad District.

==Capitals==
The capitals of the county were the Liptó Castle, later Németlipcse (present-day Partizánska Ľupča), and since 1677 the capital was Liptószentmiklós (present-day Liptovský Mikuláš).

==History==
Liptó county as a Hungarian comitatus arose before the 15th century. At various points throughout history the county was ruled by Voivodes or Counts from the Rosenberg, Csák and Benyovszky families. In the aftermath of World War I, the area became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon.

<text>Zemplén (, , , ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. The northern part of its territory is now situated in eastern Slovakia (Zemplín region), while a smaller southern portion of the former county belongs to Hungary, as part of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County.

==Geography==

Zemplén county shared borders with Poland (during some periods the with the Austrian crownland Galicia) and the Hungarian counties Sáros, Abaúj-Torna, Borsod, Szabolcs and Ung. It was situated in the easternmost strip of what is now Slovakia (except for the region between Vihorlatské vrchy and the Latorica river), plus a strip along the Bodrog and Tisza rivers in present-day Hungary. The rivers Laborc and Bodrog flowed through the county. Its area was 6,269 km2 around 1910.

==Capitals==
Initially, the capital of the county was the Zemplín Castle (Hungarian: &quot;Zempléni vár&quot;, Slovak: &quot;Zemplínsky hrad&quot;), in the 13th century also Sárospatak (in Slovak: Potok, meaning stream, brook, hence the alternative name of the county &quot;comitatus de Potok&quot;). Since the Late Middle Ages the capital was the town of Zemplén, and since 1748 was Sátoraljaújhely (which is now divided between Slovakia and Hungary by the Ronyva/Roňava stream; the Hungarian part is known in Slovak as Nové Mesto pod Šiatrom and the Slovak part is now a separate village called Slovenské Nové Mesto).

==History==
Zemplén was one of the oldest counties of the Kingdom of Hungary. In the aftermath of World War I, in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon the northern part of Zemplén county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia. The southern half (including the bigger part of the divided Sátoraljaújhely) stayed in Hungary as the county of Zemplén. Following the provisions of the First Vienna Award, an additional part became part of Hungary again in November 1938. The Trianon borders were restored after World War II, and the Hungarian county Zemplén merged with Abaúj, the most of Borsod-Gömör and a little part of Szabolcs counties to form the present Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County. 

==Demographics==



==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Zemplén county were:
The towns of Sátoraljaújhely, Sárospatak, Tokaj and Szerencs are now in Hungary, except for a small northern part (about a quarter) of Sátoraljaújhely to the northeast of the Ronyva (Rožňava) stream in Slovakia, now a small village with its own artificial Slovak name Slovenské Nové Mesto.

<text>Persona Communications, formerly Regional Cablesystems, was a cable television, Internet and telecommunications provider in Canada.

Persona was purchased by EastLink in 2007. At that point it ceased to be an independent company, and the Persona name survived only as the brand name of some of EastLink&#x27;s operations in Western Canada, before the transition to the EastLink brand was completed in 2010. Other brands used included Coast Cable along the Sunshine Coast, Delta Cable near the Fraser River Delta, and Northern Cablevision in parts of rural Alberta.

Until its takeover by EastLink, Persona was the fifth largest cable television provider in Canada, following Shaw, Rogers, Vidéotron and Cogeco.

==History==

As Regional Cablesystems, the company began operations in 1986 in Newfoundland. It expanded through the acquisition of non-metropolitan cable systems in Canada through the 1990s — notably Northern Cable in 1998, which gave the company two of the largest markets, Sudbury and Timmins, that it ever served as an independent company — and changed its corporate name to Persona in 2001.

Formerly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the publicly listed company went private in 2004 when it was bought by Dallas-based Hicks Muse Tate &amp; Furst Inc. (now HM Capital), TD Capital Canadian Private Equity Partners (now Birch Hill Equity Partners) and CIBC World Markets Inc.

On May 4, 2007, EastLink announced a purchase offer for Persona, for an undisclosed price. The deal was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) later that year. Persona&#x27;s cable services in Newfoundland and Labrador were rebranded in 2008 as EastLink, although systems elsewhere in Canada remained branded as Persona. In May 2009, this rebranding was extended to Ontario and Quebec. The Persona name was still used in parts of Western Canada until 2010.

On July 1, 2009, Eastlink sold Persona&#x27;s cable operations in Saskatchewan to Access Communications.

==Other operations==
In 2005, several longtime executives of Persona Cable, including former CEO Brendan Paddick, moved on to construct and develop a Caribbean-based cable provider named Columbus Communications, which currently operates in The Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Persona also formerly owned Cable Bahamas, a cable operator in the Bahamas which is now part of Columbus. In 2015 Columbus Communications was acquired by Cable &amp; Wireless Communications.

The company&#x27;s PersonaTV division operated local cable community channels in the markets Persona served, although the channels&#x27; branding varied depending on the market.

The company launched cable Internet services in 2001 through a partnership with Sudbury-based ISP Cyberbeach. The following year, Persona directly acquired Cyberbeach. Persona also offered dial-up Internet service in some markets, including both North Bay and Sault Ste. Marie, which were not served by Persona&#x27;s cable division.

<doc id="349048" wikidata="Q1054981" url="?curid=349048" title="Hont County">
<text>Hont County was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Most of its territory is now part of Slovakia, while a smaller southern portion is part of Hungary.

Today, in Slovakia Hont is the informal designation of the corresponding territory and an official tourist region.

==Geography==
Hont county shared borders with the counties Bars, Zólyom, Nógrád, Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun and Esztergom. It was situated between Selmecbánya and the Danube river, but the territory around the town of Korpona was added only at the end of the 19th century. The rivers Korpona and Ipoly were the central rivers that flowed through the county. Its area was 2633 km2 around 1910.

==Capitals==
The capitals of the county were the Hont Castle together with Hídvég (present-day Ipeľské Predmostie), then from the 16th century onwards there was no permanent capital, and finally since early 19th century, the capital was Ipolyság (present-day Šahy).

==History==
The county arose in the 11th century by separation from the Nógrád county. Around the year 1300, the territory of Kishont was added to the territory of the county, but received a special status.

From 1552 to 1685, most of the county was part of the Ottoman Empire and belonged to the administrative unit called Nógrád sandjak.

Changes to the northern border of the county were performed in 1802 (Kishont became part of the Gömör-Kishont county) and then in the late 19th century (above all Korpona was added to the territory).

In the aftermath of World War I, most of Hont county became part of newly formed First Czechoslovak Republic (Czechoslovakia), as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon. A small part of the county situated south-east of the river Ipoly/Ipeľ, stayed in Hungary.

In Czechoslovakia, the county continued to exist as the Hont county (). In 1923, it became part of the Zvolen county. The Hungarian part of Hont merged with the Hungarian part of Nógrád county to form Nógrád-Hont county in 1923.

In 1928, it became part of the newly created Slovak Land (). After the First Vienna Award, between 1938 and 1945, it was united with the redeemed parts of former Bars and Hont counties to form Bars-Hont county with the capital of Léva. The remaining northern part became part of the newly created Hron county (1940–1945) of the Slovak Republic. After World War II, the Trianon borders were restored and Nógrád-Hont County was reformed on her remnants in Hungary. In 1949, the Czechoslovak part became part of the newly created Nitra region and Banská Bystrica region of Czechoslovakia (Fourth Czechoslovak Republic), while the Hungarian part was eventually merged into newly formed Pest County in 1950. In 1960, the Czechoslovak part became part of the newly created and . In 1993, Czechoslovakia was split and in 1996 its territory became part of the newly created Nitra and Banská Bystrica regions of Slovakia.

==Demographics==



==Subdivisions==

Until 1802, the county consisted of 3 processuses (in Slovak slúžnovské okresy; a type of districts led by &quot;iudices nobilium&quot;) plus the Kishont district. In 1802, when Kishont was removed, the county was divided in four new processus.

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Hont county were:

The towns of Vámosmikola and Szob are now in Hungary.

<text>This is a list of all named mountains on Mars.

== Naming ==

Most Martian mountains have a name including one of the following astrogeological terms:
* &quot;Mons&quot; — large, isolated, mountain; may or may not be of volcanic origin.
** plural &quot;montes&quot; — mountain range.
* &quot;Tholus&quot; — small dome-shaped mountain or hill.
** plural &quot;tholi&quot; — group of (usually not contiguous) small mountains.
* &quot;Dorsum&quot; — long low range. Name type not present on Mars.
** plural &quot;dorsa&quot;
* &quot;Patera&quot; — dish-shaped depressions on volcano peaks; not very high compared to diameter.
** plural &quot;paterae&quot;

== Caveats ==

Listed are the elevations of the peaks (the vertical position relative to the areoid, which is the Martian vertical datum — the surface defined as zero elevation by average martian atmospheric pressure and planet radius), which is &quot;not&quot; the height above the surrounding terrain (topographic prominence). Listed mons elevation is the highest point (at 16 pixels/degree) within the feature. Listed patera elevation is the average elevation of the shallow dish-shaped depression (the actual &#x27;patera&#x27;) at the summit.

<text>Nógrád (, ; ) is a county () of Hungary. It sits on the northern edge of Hungary and borders Slovakia.

==Description==
Nógrád county lies in northern Hungary. It shares borders with Slovakia and the Hungarian counties Pest, Heves and Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén. The capital of Nógrád county is Salgótarján. Its area is 2,544 km². It is the smallest county by population and the second smallest by area (after Komárom-Esztergom).

Nógrád is famous for its historic architecture of ancient Gothic churches and stone castles dated to the 13th century. Some historic landmarks includes the Salgó Castle and several baroque buildings constructed in the 18th century and the Vay, Teleki. Much of the northern border of the county is formed by the river Ipoly. The mountain ranges Börzsöny, Cserhát and Mátra lie partly in the county.

Due to the mountains, the county is characterised by small villages nestled in the valleys. The two largest settlements are Balassagyarmat, the former county seat, and Salgótarján, which has become a center of industry in the early 20th century due to coal mines nearby.

==History==

Nógrád (-Hungarian, in Latin: &quot;comitatus Neogradiensis&quot;, in German: &quot;Neuburg&quot; or &quot;Neograd&quot;, in Slovak: &quot;Novohrad&quot;) was also the name of a historic administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. The name stems from the former Nógrád castle ( - this name is still used in Slovakia as well as the informal designation of the corresponding territory, now located in southern Slovakia and in northern Hungary). In turn, Novohrad means &quot;new castle&quot; in Slovak.

<text>Guido Fubini (19 January 1879 – 6 June 1943) was an Italian mathematician, known for Fubini&#x27;s theorem and the Fubini–Study metric.

== Life ==
Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied differential geometry under Ulisse Dini and Luigi Bianchi. His 1900 doctoral thesis was about Clifford&#x27;s parallelism in elliptic spaces.

After earning his doctorate, he took up a series of professorships. In 1901 he began teaching at the University of Catania in Sicily; shortly afterwards he moved to the University of Genoa; and in 1908 he moved to the Politecnico in Turin and then the University of Turin, where he stayed for a few decades.

During this time his research focused primarily on topics in mathematical analysis, especially differential equations, functional analysis, and complex analysis; but he also studied the calculus of variations, group theory, non-Euclidean geometry, and projective geometry, among other topics. With the outbreak of World War I, he shifted his work towards more applied topics, studying the accuracy of artillery fire; after the war, he continued in an applied direction, applying results from this work to problems in electrical circuits and acoustics.

In 1938, when Fubini at the age of 59 was nearing retirement, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascists adopted the anti-Jewish policies advocated for several years by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazis. As a Jew, Fubini feared for the safety of his family, and so accepted an invitation by Princeton University to teach there; he died in New York City four years later.

== Legacy ==
A main-belt asteroid, 22495 Fubini, was named in his honour.

<text>Abov (Hungarian: &quot;Abaúj&quot;) is historically the Slovak name of Abaúj County in the Kingdom of Hungary. Today, it is an informal designation of the part of that county situated in Slovakia, as well as the official name of one of Slovakia&#x27;s tourist regions (situated in that territory). The southern half of the former county is part of modern Hungary.

==Geography==
Abov is situated some 20 km to both sides along the Hornád river () around Košice.

==History==
The (whole) county arose in the second half of the 13th century from the &quot;comitatus Novi Castri&quot; (named after &quot;Novum Castrum&quot;, today Abaújvár), which also included the later counties Sáros and Heves counties. In 1882, the county was merged with the small Torna County and has existed as the Abaúj-Torna county since. This county previously existed temporarily in 1785-1790 and 1848-1859.

In 1920, the northern half of the county (including Košice) became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia and continued to exist as an administrative unit till 1922 (&quot;Abovskoturnianska župa&quot;).

By the First Vienna Award most of the Czechoslovak part of the county was returned to Hungary and added to the county of Abaúj-Torna, with Košice () as capital. After World War II, the pre-war border was restored.

<doc id="349053" wikidata="Q6094400" url="?curid=349053" title="Iterated integral">
<text>In multivariable calculus, an iterated integral is the result of applying integrals to a function of more than one variable (for example formula_1 or formula_2) in such a way that each of the integrals considers some of the variables as given constants. For example, the function formula_1, if formula_4 is considered a given parameter, can be integrated with respect to formula_5, formula_6. The result is a function of formula_4 and therefore its integral can be considered. If this is done, the result is the iterated integral 

:formula_8
It is key for the notion of iterated integrals that this is different, in principle, from the multiple integral
:formula_9

In general, although these two can be different, Fubini&#x27;s theorem states that under specific conditions, they are equivalent. 

The alternative notation for iterated integrals
:formula_10
is also used.

In the notation that uses parentheses, iterated integrals are computed following the operational order indicated by the parentheses starting from the most inner integral outside. In the alternative notation, writing formula_11, the innermost integrand is computed first.

==Examples==

===A simple computation===

For the iterated integral

:formula_12

the integral

:formula_13

is computed first and then the result is used to compute the integral with respect to &quot;y&quot;.

:formula_14

This example omits the constants of integration. After the first integration with respect to &quot;x&quot;, we would rigorously need to introduce a &quot;constant&quot; function of &quot;y&quot;. That is, If we were to differentiate this function with respect to &quot;x&quot;, any terms containing only &quot;y&quot; would vanish, leaving the original integrand. Similarly for the second integral, we would introduce a &quot;constant&quot; function of &quot;x&quot;, because we have integrated with respect to &quot;y&quot;. In this way, indefinite integration does not make very much sense for functions of several variables.

===The order is important===
The order in which the integrals are computed is important in iterated integrals, particularly when the integrand is not continuous on the domain of integration. Examples in which the different orders lead to different results are usually for complicated functions as the one that follows.

Define the sequence formula_15 such that formula_16. Let formula_17 be a sequence of continuous functions not vanishing in the interval formula_18 and zero elsewhere, such that formula_19 for every formula_20. Define
:formula_21
In the previous sum, at each specific formula_22, at most one term is different from zero.
For this function it happens that
:formula_23

<text>Šariš is the traditional name of a region situated in northeastern Slovakia. It encompasses the territory of the former (comitatus) Sáros county.

==History==
Sáros county was created in the 13th century from the &quot;comitatus Novi Castri&quot; (named after &quot;Novum Castrum&quot;, today Abaújvár), which also included the territories of the later counties of Abaúj and Heves. The county&#x27;s territory was situated along Torysa and upper Topľa rivers. Its area was around 1910. The original seat of the county was Šariš Castle and since the 17th century, Prešov.

==Geography==
Šariš region is one of the 21 Slovakia&#x27;s official tourist regions, however, it isn&#x27;t an administrative region unlike its predecessor. Today, the region is mostly in the Prešov Region, fully including Prešov, Sabinov, and Bardejov districts, and partly including Stará Ľubovňa, Kežmarok, Vranov nad Topľou, Svidník and Stropkov districts. A small part of the region is located in the Košice Region, with Košice-okolie, and very small parts of Košice I and Gelnica districts. Major towns in the region include Prešov, Bardejov and Svidník.

<text>:&quot;The characters &quot;泉州&quot; are also used for the name of the Chinese city of Quanzhou&quot;.
 was a province of Japan in the area of southern Osaka Prefecture. It bordered on Kii to the south, Yamato and Kawachi to the east, and Settsu to the north. Its abbreviated form name was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Izumi was one of the provinces of the Kinai circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Izumi was ranked as one of the &quot;inferior countries&quot; (下国) in terms of importance. The provincial capital was located in the Fuchi neighborhood of what is now the city of Izumi. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Ōtori taisha also located in Sakai.

==History==

===Early history===
According to the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;, the Izumi and Hine Districts were separated from Kawachi Province on 23 April 716; moreover, on 8 May that same year, the Ōtori District was also separated from Kawachi, and the three districts were made into a province named . The name &quot;Izumi&quot; means , but is written with two characters, the character for being prepended due to an imperial edict in 713. This character does not play into the reading. An imperial villa, was in the area, and it seems that this has something to do with the unusual classification of : &quot;Yoshino-gen&quot; was the only other province with this designation. Afterwards, on 15 September 740, Izumi was abolished and merged back into Kawachi province. On 30 May 757, it was re-established with a normal province designation .

According to the &quot;Nihon Kiryaku&quot;, on 21 April 825, four counties from Settsu Province: Higashinari, Nishinari, Kudara, and Sumiyoshi were incorporated into Izumi Province, but the local residents were opposed to this change, so the area was restored to Settsu on 8 August the same year.

The provincial capital of Izumi was located in what is now the Fuchu neighborhood of the city of Izumi, Osaka. ) The site has been excavated and is marked with a stone monument. The provincial temple of Izumi, the Izumi Kokubun-ji was also located in the city of Izumi. There is no record of a provincial nunnery.

The &quot;Engishiki&quot; record of 927 AD lists one major and 52 minor Shinto shrines in the province. The major shrine is the Ōtori taisha, located in what is now Nishi-ku, Sakai. This was also the &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province. During the Heian period, Izumi was dominated by &quot;shōen&quot; landed estates, the largest of which was the Hine shōen, which was controlled by the aristocratic Kujō family.

During the Muromachi period, the Ashikaga clan appointed the Hosokawa clan as &quot;shugo&quot; of Izumi Province. In the early 15th century, the Miyoshi clan (from Awa Province in Shikoku) invaded and defeated the Hosokawa clan and their proxies, and became rulers over a large portion of the Kansai region. Miyoshi Yoshikata (1527-1562), the younger brother of Miyoshi Nagayoshi made Kishiwada Castle his base and extensively rebuilt its fortifications. The Miyoshi also developed Sakai into an international port and profited greatly from trade. Miyoshi rule proved to be short-lived and by the 1560s the clan was in eclipse and Izumi Province had collapsed into a patchwork of local strongmen. It became a battleground between the forces of Oda Nobunaga and the followers of the &quot;Saiga Ikki&quot;, local followers of the &quot;Ikkō-ikki&quot; movement, who sought to overthrow the feudal system and establish a theocratic republic, and later under Toyotomi Hideyoshi was the base for his conquest of Kii Province. During this period, Sakai was ruled by a councilor oligarchs, and became very rich on trade with China and the Europeans. It was also a center for matchlock rifle production.

===Edo Period===
Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the port of Sakai came under the rule of the &quot;Osaka machi-bugyō&quot;, and the province itself was divided into a patchwork of holdings directly by the shogunate (&quot;tenryō&quot;) or various &quot;daimyō&quot;

==Meiji period==
Following the Meiji restoration, Sakai became &quot;Sakai Prefecture&quot; in 1868 and gradually absorbed all of the &quot;tenryō&quot; and holdings of the various &quot;daimyō&quot; from other areas. The northern border the province with Settsu was adjusted in 1870 with part of the area of Sumiyoshi District of Settsu Province added into Ōtori District. The border was changed from roads of Ōshōji and Nagao Kaidō in Sakai to the Yamato River. Also in 1870, Mikami Domain in Ōmi Province relocated its seat to Yoshimi in Izumi, and was renamed &quot;Yoshimi Domain&quot; briefly before the abolition of the han system several months later in 1871. Yoshimi, Kishiwada and Hakata all became prefectures, which were then merged into . Sakai Prefecture was merged into Nara Prefecture on April 18, 1876, but was subsequently transferred to Osaka Prefecture on February 21, 1881 Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation’s resources, the province had 352 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 170,885 &quot;koku&quot;. Izumi Province consisted of:

The districts were reduced from four to two on April 1, 1896:
* Senboku District (泉北郡) – merger of Ōtori and Izumi Districts; creating a district that covered the former northern part of Izumi Province
* Sennan District (泉南郡) – merger of Minami and Hine Districts; creating a district that covered the former southern part of Izumi Province

<doc id="349056" wikidata="Q843882" url="?curid=349056" title="Ōmi Province">
<text>was a province of Japan, which today comprises Shiga Prefecture. It was one of the provinces that made up the Tōsandō circuit. Its nickname is . Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Ōmi was ranked as one of the 13 &quot;great countries&quot; (大国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;near countries&quot; (近国) in terms of distance from the imperial capital Kyoto. 

Ōmi bordered on Wakasa and Echizen Provinces to the north, Mino and Ise Provinces to the east, Iga and Yamato Provinces to the south, and Yamashiro and Tanba Provinces to the west. Lake Biwa, Japan&#x27;s largest lake, is located at the center of the province.

==History==
The area of Ōmi has been settled since at least the Yayoi period, and the traces of several large settlements have been found. During the Kofun period, the area appears to have been dominated by several powerful immigrant clans, most notably the Wani clan, originally from Baekje. The names of &quot;Ōmi&quot; or &quot;Lake Biwa&quot; do not appear in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; or other ancient documents. Ōmi was originally called by various names. Wooden tags from the ruins of Asuka-kyō state &quot;Ahaumi&quot; (淡海), or variations therefore, including &quot;Chikaumi&quot; (近淡海), meaning &quot;fresh-water sea or &quot;nearby freshwater sea&quot;, which evolved into or Ōmi-no-umi, (近江海). The name was only fixed to &quot;Ōmi&quot; after the enactment and enforcement of the Taiho Code in 701 AD and the decree of 713 AD that the names of the provinces as defined under the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system should be named using two auspicious &quot;kanji&quot;.

The Ōmi Ōtsu Palace, located in what is now the city of Ōtsu, and later the Shigaraki Palace in the city of Kōka were briefly the capitals of Japan, and Ōmi was the location of several battles of the Asuka period Jinshin War. During the Nara period, the provincial capital and provincial temple were built in Ōtsu near the ruins of the former Ōmi Ōtsu Palace. Takebe taisha was designated as the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) for the province. During the Heian period, then proximity of Ōmi to the capital at Heian-kyō, its location on the Tōkaidō and Nakasendō highways connecting the capital with the provinces of eastern Japan, and the main route from the capital to the Sea of Japan gave the province great strategic importance. With the spread of Buddhism in Japan, the great Tendai monastery of Enryaku-ji was constructed at Mount Hiei in Ōmi.

From the late Heian period and into the Kamakura period, the Sasaki clan controlled the post of &quot;shugo&quot; of Ōmi Province, and their cadet houses of the Rokkaku clan and Kyōgoku clan continued to dominate the province into the Muromachi period. In the tumultuous Sengoku period, internal struggles weakened both clans, and Ōmi became a battleground between the Azai and Asakura clans in the north and in the south the Rokkaku were supported by the famous Kōga ninja. In the late 1560s into the 1570s, lord Oda Nobunaga invaded from the east, defeating the Azai, Asakura, Rokkaku, Kōka, and the Ashikaga shogunate. He built Azuchi Castle near Lake Biwa in Ōmi, from which he planned to eventually rule all of Japan and beyond. Following Nobunaga&#x27;s assassination in Honnō-ji temple, much of the province was awarded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi to Ishida Mitsunari, Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s arch-rival at the Battle of Sekigahara.

After the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, much of the province was divided into several feudal domains, then largest of which was Hikone Domain, ruled by the Ii clan. Ōmi continued in its role as a transportation conduit, with five stations of the Tōkaidō and eight stations of the Nakasendō.

Following the Meiji restoration, on November 22, 1871 Ōtsu Prefecture and Nagahama Prefecture were created from former &quot;tenryō&quot; and &quot;hatamoto&quot; territories within the province, and each of the former domains formed its own prefecture. These were merged on January 19, 1872 to form Shiga Prefecture. From August 21, 1876 to February 7, 1881 the Reinan region of Fukui Prefecture (west of Tsuruga city) was part of Shiga Prefecture, thus giving it a shoreline on the Sea of Japan. The merger was strongly opposed by the local inhabitants, and the merger was withdrawn.

==Historical districts==

Ōmi was divided into 12 Districts (郡), which were further subdivided into 93 counties (郷), containing 1,597 villages. The total assessed value of the province in terms of &quot;kokudaka&quot; was 858,618 &quot;koku&quot;.

<text>Kysuce is a traditional informal name of a region in north-western Slovakia, situated around the Kysuca river and bordering the Orava region in the east, Poland in the north and the Czech Republic in the west. It consists of two districts: Čadca and Kysucké Nové Mesto. The northern part is called the Čadecké region and is part of the Goral Lands. The region is surrounded by the numerous mountain ranges, for example Javorníky with the highest hill Veľký Javorník (1,071 m) in the west, the Moravian-Silesian Beskids with the highest hill Veľký Polom (1,067 m) in the north. In the East there are Kysucké Beskydy with the highest mountain (also the highest in the region) – Veľká Rača (1,236 m) – the symbol of Kysuce. In the South there is Kysucká vrchovina with the highest hill – Ľadonhora (999 m). The oldest known settlement in Kysuce is the city Kysucké Nové Mesto, which is located on an important trade route through the region. The route connects north with south; went from Žilina through Jablunkovský priesmyk, to Tešín.

==History==

===From Stone age to Antiquity===

Archeological foundings in Kysuce allow you to assume the presence of man on this territory already in the earlier Stone Age. This is evidenced by, for example, the findings of mammoths teeth and bones of a rhinosaurs, a fraction of patented clawed blade from Nezbudska Lúčka. Or a spear from Ochodnica. An important place for archaeologists is Koscelisko in Radoľa. From there we have a hammer and blade from obsidian and various other fragments which can document settlement of Kysuce in Neolit, but also other findings from earlier periods. The largest fortification built in Kysuce was built by the local people on a small hill, Malý Vreten in Oškerda, which is located close to Kysucká brána. Found ceramics in the fort is thought to be dated back from the late Bronze Age or the beginning of the old Iron Age (8th–7th century BCE)

===Middle ages===
There is no evidence of human presence in Kysuce in the 1st century CE and it is believed that the territory began to be used again by the first Slavs in the 5th century CE. The oldest direct written record of Kysuce is Belos deed from 1244 which was for Bohumír, the son of Sebeslav; &quot;... terram quandam in confinio Polonia... KisZudcze...“. This borders the property between the rivers Kysuca, Divinka and Vranie, around the same as the territory of the later Budatín estate.

In Radoľa were discovered the foundations of a church from around the 13th century. From historical documents, only data from the census of papal tithes (1332–1337), when the local pastor, Peter, paid tax 6 pennies and his rectory was the only one in the region, can be assigned. In the deed from 1244 Béla IV of Hungary gives Bohumír, the son of Sebeslav, territory west to Kysuce until the Polish borders on the north and river Vranie in the south. The core of this region was in 1254 town Jačatín, which was important as a toll station in 1321 and as a settlement growing into a city in 1325 – nowadays Kysucké Nové mesto.

From 1325 comes the first written mention of the village Krasno nad Kysucou – the oldest town in the north of Kysuce. In the 15th–16th century the village belonged to the parish Radoľa, later to parish Kysucké Nové Mesto. In the 1770s and 1780s the village belonged to the parish of Stará Bystrica. In 1788, created in Krasno nad Kysucou a separated parish with an affiliate in Zborov nad Bystricou. Krásno nad Kysucou now has a status of a city.

===Modern age===

From the period of the modern age comes great fortification Šance pri Mostoch near Jablunkov.

In 1535, the first time mentioned a new settlement Klubina first location in Kysuce established by the Wallachian law. In throwing Strečno, Bytča and old castle from 1540 mentions hills Zborov, Diedova and Blasovicz.

First mention of Čadca is located in a dispute over Hungary-Silesian border in 1565, which shows that as more permanent settlement started to develop only recently, got a name from a river Čadčianka (Čadečka). The landowners Budatín estate in 1572 was referred to as &quot;Wes Cziatcza&quot; that had Wallachian mayoralty, 2 peasant and one cotter homestead.

The landowners in 1572, in addition to Cadca first time in written documents also appears Lopušné. In 1578 states that privileged Vlachs are well established in Vadičov. Already in the 1580s several Wallachian sheep farms chorvarky concentrated in places Ochodnica, Stará Bystrica, Oščadnica, Zborov, Kalinov, Svrčinovec, Javorské, turned into villages, respectively. kopanice

In the second half of the 16th century incurred for shepherding rights settlements Dunajov, Ochodnica a Stará Bystrica.

The oldest settlement based on this law has been Turzovka. First mentioned in 1601, it was an established Bytča estate of Turzo and began to be built in the late 16th century.

Additional settlements of Kysuce colonization based on this law include: Olešná, Vysoká nad Kysucou (from the homesteads in the early 18th century. Settlement began to shape Makov) mentioned in 1619. Lodno, Horelica, Raková, Svrčinovec a Staškov are first mentioned in 1640. In 1641, Oščadnica is written. As a brand new complex provides landowners Nová Bystrica in 1662. Also Zborov, Pažite i Zákopčie are mentioned here as villages for the first time. Radôstka and Lutiše were built by the people of Stará Bystrica in around half of the 17th century. Čierne is mentioned in 1662 also built by locals.

In 1696, a new village Riečnica, which was shared by Löwenburgs homestead in 1713. In division and in the borders Riečnica in the border states and Nova Bystrica mentions Vychylovka settlement, which later developed into a separate village. New Bystrica was part of the &quot;mons Havrjelka&quot; and &quot;aqua Oselnicza&quot; below which arose later hamlets inhabitants of the Old and New Bystrica. Their association was founded in 1950 Harvelka village. At the same time arose the vast Turzovka, of which only recently created municipality Klokočov, Korňa and Dlhá nad Kysucou.

The Manor-house in Radola is one of the oldest historical monuments in Kysuce.

==Settlement==

The oldest known settlement in the Kysuce region is Kysucké Nové Mesto, which was first mentioned in 1321 as a toll collecting place, which was part of a trade route between Žilina and Těšín via Jablunkov Pass, but otherwise the region was relatively uninhabited.

Kysuce region began to be settled in the 16th and 17th centuries at the time of Vlach colonization. The new inhabitants were mostly Slovaks, from foreign settlers Rusyns, Poles and Romanians, but also Czechs and Germans. Many towns were established first around this time, for example Čadca in 1572. Many people live in small villages or lone cottages in the mountains (which are called &quot;kopanice&quot;). Today main towns in the Kysuce region are Kysucké Nové Mesto, Čadca and Turzovka. The northern part of the region is inhabited by Gorals.

==Climate==
Like the neighboring Orava region, Kysuce region has long winters, long-lasting snow cover, and cold rainy weather in general, which causes the local people to feel the need to heat their homes from September or October until May. Many of the villages and cottages are difficult to access during the winter months.

==Economy==

Traditionally, Kysuce was considered to be one of the poor regions in Slovakia. Inhabitants of Kysuce had to commute for work elsewhere, for example to the coal mines in the Ostrava Region in the Czech Republic, as the region has little industry. The worst situation was in the 1990s when many factories were shut down or reduced. However, the regional economy is now recovering and growing thanks to the good ski and cross-country conditions and the &quot;Snow Paradise&quot; center in Veľká Rača-Oščadnica is one of the most developed ski resorts in Slovakia, and car manufacturing companies. There are also many other tourist attractions available, for example the switchback railway near Nová Bystrica, or museum of the Kysuce village also near Nová Bystrica, which was created in 1974 primarily for the purpose of saving buildings from the villages inundated by the Nová Bystrica reservoir.

==Transport==
The region is located at the main road and railway between Žilina and Ostrava, as well to Poland. The first railroad that connected Kysuce to the other parts of Austria-Hungary was built in 1871 as part of the Košice-Bohumín Railway. Currently, there is only one short part of the D3 motorway between Oščadnica and Čadca. Connection to Orava is currently under construction and should be opened in 2008. It should replace the original road, which was inundated along with the construction of Nová Bystrica reservoir, leaving 11 km gap between the two ends of formerly compact road.

<doc id="349063" wikidata="Q2574718" url="?curid=349063" title="Omi (title)">
<text>is a hereditary noble title (&quot;kabane&quot;) of ancient Japan. It was given to the descendants of the Imperial Family before Emperor Kōgen. Along with &quot;Muraji&quot;, &quot;Omi&quot; was reserved for the head of the most powerful clans during the Kofun period. When the Yamato court was established, the most influential families bearing these two titles were given the title &quot;Ōomi&quot; and &quot;Ōmuraji&quot;, respectively.

== History ==
The O&quot;mi&quot; clans generally took their names from the geographic location from which they originated, such as the , the , the , the , the , and the , thus making them regional chieftains in their own right.

The most powerful &quot;Omi&quot; added the prefix to the O&quot;mi&quot; title, and were referred to as . Examples of &quot;Ōomi&quot; mentioned in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; included during the reign of Emperor Richū, during the reign of Emperors Yūryaku and Seinei, during the reign of Emperor Keitai and the four generations of Sogas who dominated the title during the 6th and 7th centuries: Soga no Iname, Soga no Umako, Soga no Emishi and Soga no Iruka.

When the &quot;kabane&quot; system was reformed into the eight kabane system in 684 following a series of coup attempts, the powerful O&quot;mi&quot; of the time were given the &quot;kabane&quot; of &quot;Ason&quot;, which ranked second under the new system, and O&quot;mi&quot; itself was dropped to sixth in rank.

== Name ==
The title denoted supremacy within the court, with titular power belonging to the &quot;Ōkimi&quot; (later denoted Emperor), whether or not he actually held power.

These same characters of &quot;Ōomi&quot; () are pronounced &quot;Daijin&quot; to refer to titles beyond 670 A.D. in &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, &quot;Udaijin&quot;, &quot;Naidaijin&quot;, etc.

== List of &quot;Ōomi&quot; ==
* (84–?) 
* (?–456) 
* (?–498)
* (?–529)
* (c. 506–570)
* (551–626)
* (587–645)
* (?–645)

== In popular culture ==
The name &quot;Omi&quot; holds a superior power in &quot;HvH&quot;.

<text>was a Japanese province in the area of Nara Prefecture on the island of Honshū. It was a short-lived special division of the provinces of Japan, a part of Kinai. It was composed of only one district, . Its extent roughly coincides with that of today&#x27;s Yoshino District plus Gojō city.

Yoshino was established by separating Yoshino District from Yamato Province. The time of its founding is unknown, but it is thought that it happened at around the same time as the establishment of in 716. The unit name “” () was different from the “” () of normal provinces. No record remains of the reasons for their establishment. Both new provinces were unusually small and contained secondary palaces: the in the Yoshino province and the Chinu Palace in Izumi.

Yoshino Province was abolished some time after the year 738 and its territory was absorbed back into Yamato Province.

<text>was a province of Japan in the area of Japan that is today southern Gifu Prefecture. Mino was bordered by Ōmi to the west, Echizen and Hida to the north, Shinano to the east, and Ise, Mikawa, and Owari to the south. Its abbreviated form name was . Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Mino was ranked as one of the 13 &quot;great countries&quot; (大国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;near countries&quot; (近国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital and &quot;ichinomiya&quot; were located in what is now the town of Tarui.

==Historical record==
&quot;Mino&quot; is an ancient place name, and appears in &quot;mokkan&quot; wooden tags from the ruins of Asuka-kyō, Fujiwara-kyō, and other ancient sites, but using the &quot;kanji&quot; &quot;三野国&quot;. Per the &quot;Kujiki&quot;, there were originally three separate countries in Mino, centered around what is now Ōgaki, Ōno, and Kakamigahara. Each had its own &quot;Kuni no miyatsuko&quot;, and together with Motosu (in eastern Gifu) and Mugetsu (in north-central Gifu), these five entities were joined under Yamato rule to form the province of Mino. The use of the &quot;kanji&quot; &quot;美濃&quot; is found in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and became prevalent in the Nara period. Early Mino included much of Kiso District in Shinano and portions of northern Owari. The route of the ancient Tōsandō highway connecting the ancient capitals of Japan and the eastern provinces passed through Mino, and even in 713 AD, records indicate that the road was widened to accommodate increasing numbers of travelers.

The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; indicates that numerous immigrants from the Hata clan and from Silla settled in Mino in the Asuka and Nara periods.

During the Kamakura and Muromachi Period, the Toki clan held the position of &quot;shugo&quot; of Mino Province. During the Sengoku period, Saitō Dōsan usurped political power from the Toki, and later the province was conquered by Oda Nobunaga. The Battle of Sekigahara took place at the western edge of Mino, near the mountains between the Chūbu Region and the Kinki Region. With the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, several feudal domains were established in Mino. At the time of the Meiji restoration, Mino was divided into 18 districts, which in turn were divided into 131 subdistricts and 1561 villages. The total assessed &quot;kokudaka&quot; of the province was 654,872 &quot;koku&quot;.

==Historical districts==
Mino Province consisted of twenty-one districts:

<doc id="349068" wikidata="Q83618" url="?curid=349068" title="Maratha Confederacy">
<text>The Maratha Confederacy, also referred to as the Maratha Empire, was an early modern polity in the Indian subcontinent. It comprised the realms of the Peshwa and four major independent Maratha states often subordinate to the former. It was established in 1674 with the coronation of Shivaji as the Maratha Chhatrapati and recognised by Emperor Bahadur Shah I as a tributary state in 1707 following a prolonged rebellion. Following this, the Marathas continued to recognise the Mughal emperor as their nominal suzerain, similar to other contemporary Indian entities, though in practice, imperial politics at Delhi were largely controlled by the Marathas between 1737 and 1803.

Although Shivaji came from the Maratha community, the Maratha government also included warriors, administrators, and other nobles from the Maratha and several other Marathi groups from what is known today as Maharashtra. Shivaji&#x27;s monarchy was initially referred to as the Maratha Kingdom, which expanded into a large realm in the 18th century under the leadership of Peshwa Bajirao I. The Marathas were a Marathi-speaking peasantry group from the western Deccan Plateau (present-day Maharashtra) who rose to prominence by establishing Hindavi Swarajya (meaning &quot;self-rule of Indians&quot;).

The Marathas became prominent in the politics of the Indian subcontinent during the seventeenth century under the leadership of Shivaji, who revolted against the Adil Shahi dynasty and the Mughals to carve out a kingdom with Raigad as his capital. The religious attitude of Emperor Aurangzeb estranged non-Muslims, and the Maratha insurgency came at a great cost for his men and treasury and eventually ensured Maratha ascendency and their control over sizeable portions of former Mughal dominions in the north of the Indian subcontinent.

After Aurangzeb&#x27;s death in 1707, Shivaji&#x27;s grandson Shahu under the leadership of Peshwa Bajirao revived Maratha power and confided a great deal of authority to the Bhat family, who became hereditary peshwas (prime ministers). After he died in 1749, they became the effective rulers. The leading Maratha familiesScindia, Holkar, Bhonsle, and Gaekwadextended their conquests in northern and central India and became more independent and difficult to control. The Marathas&#x27; rapid expansion was halted with the great defeat of Panipat in 1761, at the hands of the Afghan Empire, following which the effective power of Peshwas over other chiefs came to an end.

The structure of the Maratha state was that of a confederacy of four Rajas under the leadership of the Peshwa at Poona (now Pune) in western India from 1721 till 1818. These were the Raja of Gwalior of the House of Scindia, the Raja of Baroda of the House of Gaekwad, the Raja of Indore of the House of Holkar, and the Raja of Nagpur of the House of Bhonsle, (in order of territory and jurisdiction they hold), while the Peshwa&#x27;s dominions included the territories that later became the Bombay Province and Central Provinces.

After he was defeated by the Holkar dynasty in 1802, the Peshwa Baji Rao II sought protection from the British East India Company, whose intervention destroyed the confederacy by 1818 after the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars. The stable borders of the confederacy after the Battle of Bhopal in 1737 extended from modern-day Maharashtra in the south to Gwalior in the north, to Orissa in the east or about a third of the subcontinent.

== Nomenclature ==
The Maratha Confederacy is also referred to as the Maratha Empire. Historian Barbara Ramusack notes, &quot;neither term is fully accurate since one implies a substantial degree of centralisation and the other signifies some surrender of power to a central government and a longstanding core of political administrators&quot;.

Although at present, the word Maratha refers to a traditionally Marathi peasantry group, in the past the word has been used to describe all Marathi people.

== History ==
=== Shivaji and his descendants ===
Shivaji (1630–1680) was a Maratha aristocrat of the Bhonsle clan and was the founder of the Maratha state. Shivaji led a resistance against the Sultanate of Bijapur in 1645 by winning the fort Torna, followed by many more forts, placing the area under his control and establishing Hindavi Swarajya (self-rule of Hindu people). He created an independent Maratha state with Raigad as its capital and successfully fought against the Mughals to defend his kingdom. He was crowned as Chhatrapati (sovereign) of the new Maratha Kingdom in 1674.

The Maratha dominion under him comprised about 4.1% of the subcontinent, but it was spread over large tracts. At the time of his death, it was reinforced with about 300 forts, and defended by about 40,000 cavalries, and 50,000 soldiers, as well as naval establishments along the west coast. Over time, the kingdom would increase in size and heterogeneity; by the time of his grandson&#x27;s rule, and later under the Peshwas in the early 18th century, it became a vast realm.

Shivaji had two sons: Sambhaji and Rajaram, who had different mothers and were half-brothers. In 1681, Sambhaji succeeded to the crown after his father&#x27;s death and resumed his expansionist policies. Sambhaji had earlier defeated the Portuguese and Chikka Deva Raya of Mysore. To nullify the alliance between his rebel son, Akbar, and the Marathas, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb headed south in 1681. With his entire imperial court, administration and an army of about 500,000 troops, he proceeded to expand the Mughal empire, gaining territories such as the sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda. During the eight years that followed, Sambhaji led the Marathas successfully against the Mughals.

In early 1689, Sambhaji called his commanders for a strategic meeting at Sangameshwar to consider an onslaught on the Mughal forces. In a meticulously planned operation, Ganoji and Aurangzeb&#x27;s commander, Mukarrab Khan, attacked Sangameshwar when Sambhaji was accompanied by just a few men. Sambhaji was ambushed and captured by the Mughal troops on 1 February 1689. He and his advisor, Kavi Kalash, were taken to Bahadurgad by the imperial army, where they were executed by the Mughals on 21 March 1689. Aurangzeb had charged Sambhaji with attacks by Maratha forces on Burhanpur.

Upon Sambhaji&#x27;s death, his half-brother Rajaram ascended the throne. The Mughal siege of Raigad continued, and he had to flee to Vishalgad and then to Gingee for safety. From there, the Marathas raided Mughal territory, and many forts were recaptured by Maratha commanders such as Santaji Ghorpade, Dhanaji Jadhav, Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi, Shankaraji Narayan Sacheev and Melgiri Pandit. In 1697, Rajaram offered a truce but this was rejected by Aurangzeb. Rajaram died in 1700 at Sinhagad. His widow, Tarabai, assumed control in the name of her son, Ramaraja (Shivaji II).
After Aurangzeb died in 1707, Shahu, the son of Sambhaji (and grandson of Shivaji), was released by Bahadur Shah I, the new Mughal emperor. However, his mother was kept a hostage of the Mughals to ensure that Shahu adhered to the release conditions. Upon release, Shahu immediately claimed the Maratha throne and challenged his aunt Tarabai and her son. The spluttering Mughal-Maratha war became a three-cornered affair. This resulted in two rival seats of government being set up in 1707 at Satara and Kolhapur by Shahu and Tarabai respectively. Shahu appointed Balaji Vishwanath as his Peshwa. The Peshwa was instrumental in securing Mughal recognition of Shahu as the rightful heir of Shivaji and the Chhatrapati of the Marathas. Balaji also gained the release of Shahu&#x27;s mother, Yesubai, from Mughal captivity in 1719.

During Shahu&#x27;s reign, Raghoji Bhonsle expanded the kingdom eastwards. Khanderao Dabhade and later his son, Triambakrao, expanded it Westwards into Gujarat. Peshwa Bajirao and his three chiefs, Pawar (Dhar), Holkar (Indore), and Scindia (Gwalior) expanded it northwards.

=== Peshwa era ===
Shahu appointed Balaji Vishwanath as Peshwa in 1713. Balaji Vishwanath&#x27;s first major achievement was the conclusion of the &quot;Treaty of Lonavala&quot; in 1714 with Kanhoji Angre, the most powerful naval chief on the Western Coast who later accepted Shahu as Chhatrapati. In 1719, Marathas under Balaji marched to Delhi with Sayyid Hussain Ali, the Mughal governor of Deccan, and deposed the Mughal emperor, Farrukhsiyar. The new teenage emperor, Rafi ud-Darajat and a puppet of the Sayyid brothers, granted Shahu rights to collecting Chauth and Sardeshmukhi from the six Mogul provinces of Deccan, and full possession of the territories controlled by Shivaji in 1680.
After Balaji Vishwanath&#x27;s death in April 1720, his son, Baji Rao I, was appointed Peshwa by Shahu. Bajirao is credited with expanding the Maratha Kingdom tenfold from 3% to 30% of the modern Indian landscape during 1720–1740. The Battle of Palkhed was a land battle that took place on 28 February 1728 at the village of Palkhed, near the city of Nashik, Maharashtra, India between Baji Rao I and Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I of Hyderabad. The Marathas defeated the Nizam. The battle is considered an example of the brilliant execution of military strategy. In 1737, Marathas under Bajirao I raided the suburbs of Delhi in a blitzkrieg in the Battle of Delhi (1737). The Nizam set out from the Deccan to rescue the Mughals from the invasion of the Marathas, but was defeated decisively in the Battle of Bhopal. The Marathas extracted a large tribute from the Mughals and signed a treaty which ceded Malwa to the Marathas. The Battle of Vasai was fought between the Marathas and the Portuguese rulers of Vasai, a village lying on the northern shore of Vasai creek, 50 km north of Mumbai. The Marathas were led by Chimaji Appa, brother of Baji Rao. The Maratha victory in this war was a major achievement of Baji Rao&#x27;s time in office.

Baji Rao&#x27;s son, Balaji Bajirao (Nanasaheb), was appointed as the next Peshwa by Shahu despite the opposition of other chiefs. In 1740, the Maratha forces, under Raghoji Bhonsle, came down upon Arcot and defeated the Nawab of Arcot, Dost Ali, in the pass of Damalcherry. In the war that followed, Dost Ali, one of his sons Hasan Ali, and several other prominent people died. This initial success at once enhanced Maratha prestige in the south. From Damalcherry, the Marathas proceeded to Arcot, which surrendered to them without much resistance. Then, Raghuji invaded Trichinopoly in December 1740. Unable to resist, Chanda Sahib surrendered the fort to Raghuji on 14 March 1741. Chanda Saheb and his son were arrested and sent to Nagpur. Rajputana also came under Maratha attacks during this time. In June 1756 Luís Mascarenhas, Count of Alva (Conde de Alva), the Portuguese Viceroy was killed in action by the Maratha Army in Goa.

After the successful campaign of Karnataka and the Trichinopolly, Raghuji returned from Karnataka. He undertook six expeditions into Bengal from 1741 to 1748. The resurgent Maratha Confederacy launched brutal raids against the prosperous Bengali state in the 18th century, which further added to the decline of the Nawabs of Bengal. During their invasions and occupation of Bihar and western Bengal up to the Hooghly River and during their occupation of western Bengal, the Marathas perpetrated atrocities against the local population. The Maratha atrocities were recorded by both Bengali and European sources, which reported that the Marathas demanded payments, and tortured or killed anyone who couldn&#x27;t pay.

Raghuji was able to annex Odisha to his kingdom permanently as he successfully exploited the chaotic conditions prevailing in Bengal after the death of its governor Murshid Quli Khan in 1727. Constantly harassed by the Bhonsles, Odisha, Bengal and parts of Bihar were economically ruined. Alivardi Khan, the Nawab of Bengal made peace with Raghuji in 1751 ceding Cuttack (Odisha) up to the river Subarnarekha, and agreeing to pay Rs. 1.2 million annually as the Chauth for Bengal and Bihar.

The city of Delhi was sacked ten times by Marathas between 1737 and 1788. During this period, Maratha soldiers raped thousands of women including 350 Mughal queens and princesses. In May 1754, Malhar Rao Holkar with his 20,000 Maratha soldiers raided the camp of Emperor Ahmad Shah at Sikandarabad, they proceeded to loot the camp and raped women in gangs including queens and princesses after emperor had fled.

Balaji Bajirao encouraged agriculture, protected the villagers and brought about a marked improvement in the state of the territory. Raghunath Rao, brother of Nanasaheb, pushed into the wake of the Afghan withdrawal after Ahmed Shah Abdali&#x27;s plunder of Delhi in 1756. Delhi was captured by the Maratha army under Raghunath Rao in August 1757, defeating the Afghan garrison in the Battle of Delhi. This laid the foundation for the Maratha conquest of North-west India. In Lahore, as in Delhi, the Marathas were now major players. After the 1758 Battle of Attock, the Marathas captured Peshawar defeating the Afghan troops in the Battle of Peshawar on 8 May 1758.

Just prior to the battle of Panipat in 1761, the Marathas looted &quot;Diwan-i-Khas&quot; or &quot;Hall of Private Audiences&quot; in the Red Fort of Delhi, which was the place where the Mughal emperors used to receive courtiers and state guests, in one of their expeditions to Delhi.

During the Maratha invasion of Rohilkhand in the 1750s

In 1760, the Marathas under Sadashivrao Bhau (referred to as the Bhau or Bhao in sources) responded to the news of the Afghans&#x27; return to North India by sending a large army north. Bhau&#x27;s force was bolstered by some Maratha forces under Holkar, Scindia, Gaekwad and Govind Pant Bundele with Suraj Mal. The combined army of over 50,000 regular troops re-captured the former Mughal capital, Delhi, from an Afghan garrison in August 1760.

Delhi had been reduced to ashes many times due to previous invasions, and there was an acute shortage of supplies in the Maratha camp. Bhau ordered the sacking of the already depopulated city. He is said to have planned to place his nephew and the Peshwa&#x27;s son, Vishwasrao, on the Mughal throne. By 1760, with the defeat of the Nizam in the Deccan, Maratha power had reached its zenith with a territory of over .
Ahmad Shah Durrani called on the Rohillas and the Nawab of Oudh to assist him in driving out the Marathas from Delhi. Huge armies of Muslim forces and Marathas collided with each other on 14 January 1761 in the Third Battle of Panipat. The Maratha Army lost the battle, which halted their imperial expansion. The Jats and Rajputs did not support the Marathas. Historians have criticised the Maratha treatment of fellow Hindu groups. Kaushik Roy says, &quot;The treatment by the Marathas of their co-religionist fellows – Jats and Rajputs was definitely unfair and ultimately had to pay its price in Panipat where Muslim forces had united in the name of religion.&quot;

The Marathas had antagonised the Jats and Rajputs by taxing them heavily, punishing them after defeating the Mughals and interfering in their internal affairs. The Marathas were abandoned by Raja Suraj Mal of Bharatpur, who quit the Maratha alliance at Agra before the start of the great battle and withdrew their troops as Maratha general Sadashivrao Bhau did not heed the advice to leave soldiers&#x27; families (women and children) and pilgrims at Agra and not take them to the battlefield with the soldiers, rejected their co-operation. Their supply chains (earlier assured by Raja Suraj Mal) did not exist.

Peshwa Madhavrao I was the fourth Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy. He worked as a unifying force in the Confederacy and moved to the south to subdue Mysore and the Nizam of Hyderabad to assert Maratha power. He sent generals such as Bhonsle, Scindia and Holkar to the north, where they re-established Maratha authority by the early 1770s. Madhav Rao I crossed the Krishna River in 1767 and defeated Hyder Ali in the battles of Sira and Madgiri. He also rescued the last queen of the Keladi Nayaka Kingdom, who had been kept in confinement by Hyder Ali in the fort of Madgiri.

In early 1771, ten years after the collapse of Maratha authority over North India following the Third Battle of Panipat, Mahadaji Shinde recaptured Delhi and installed Shah Alam II as a puppet ruler on the Mughal throne receiving in return the title of deputy &quot;Vakil-ul-Mutlak&quot; or vice-regent of the Empire and that of &quot;Vakil-ul-Mutlak&quot; being at his request conferred on the Peshwa. The Mughals also gave him the title of &quot;Amir-ul-Amara&quot; (head of the amirs). After taking control of Delhi, the Marathas sent a large army in 1772 to punish Afghan Rohillas for their involvement in Panipat. Their army devastated Rohilkhand by looting and plundering as well as taking members of the royal family as captives.

The Marathas invaded Rohilkhand to avenge the Rohillas&#x27; atrocities in the Panipat war. The Marathas under the leadership of Mahadaji Shinde entered the &quot;land&quot; of Sardar Najib-ud-Daula which was held by his son Zabita Khan after his death. Zabita Khan initially resisted the attack with Sayyid Khan and Saadat Khan behaving with gallantry, but was eventually defeated with the death of Saadat Khan by the Marathas and was forced to flee to the camp of Shuja-ud-Daula and his country was ravaged by Marathas. Mahadaji Shinde captured the family of Zabita Khan, desecrated the grave of Najib ad-Dawlah and looted his fort. With the fleeing of the Rohillas, the rest of the country was burnt, with the exception of the city of Amroha, which was defended by some thousands of Amrohi Sayyid tribes. The Rohillas who could offer no resistance fled to the Terai whence the remaining Sardar Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech sought assistance in an agreement formed with the Nawab of Oudh, Shuja-ud-Daula, by which the Rohillas agreed to pay four million rupees in return for military help against the Marathas. Hafiz Rehmat, abhorring unnecessary violence, unlike the outlook of his fellow Rohillas such as Ali Muhammad and Najib Khan, prided himself on his role as a political mediator and sought an alliance with Awadh to keep the Marathas out of Rohilkhand. He bound himself to pay on behalf of the Rohillas. However, after he refused to pay, Oudh attacked the Rohillas.

Shah Alam II, the Mughal Emperor spent six years in the Allahabad fort and after the capture of Delhi in 1771 by the Marathas, left for his capital under their protection. He was escorted to Delhi by Mahadaji Shinde and left Allahabad in May 1771. During their short stay, Marathas constructed two temples in Allahabad city, one of them being the famous Alopi Devi Mandir. After reaching Delhi in January 1772 and realising the Maratha intent of territorial encroachment, however, Shah Alam ordered his general Najaf Khan to drive them out. In retaliation, Tukoji Rao Holkar and Visaji Krushna Biniwale attacked Delhi and defeated Mughal forces in 1772. The Marathas were granted an imperial &quot;sanad&quot; for Kora and Allahabad. They turned their attention to Oudh to gain these two territories. Shuja was, however, unwilling to give them up and made appeals to the English and the Marathas did not fare well at the Battle of Ramghat. The Maratha and British armies fought in Ram Ghat, but the sudden demise of the Peshwa and the civil war in Pune to choose the next Peshwa forced the Marathas to retreat.

Madhavrao Peshwa&#x27;s victory over the Nizam of Hyderabad and Hyder Ali of Mysore in southern India established Maratha dominance in the Deccan. On the other hand, Mahadaji&#x27;s victory over Jats of Mathura, Rajputs of Rajasthan and Pashtun-Rohillas of Rohilkhand (Bareilly division and Moradabad division of present-day Uttar Pradesh) re-established the Marathas in northern India. With the Capture of Delhi in 1771 and the capture of Najibabad in 1772 and treaties with Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II as a restricted monarch to the throne under Maratha suzerainty, the resurrection of Maratha power in the North was complete.

Madhav Rao died in 1772, at the age of 27. His death is considered to be a fatal blow to the Maratha Confederacy and from that time Maratha power started to move on a downward trajectory, less an empire than a confederacy.

=== Confederacy era ===
In a bid to effectively manage the large empire, Madhavrao Peshwa gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the aristocracy. After the death of Peshwa Madhavrao I, various chiefs and jagirdars became &quot;de facto&quot; rulers and regents for the infant Peshwa Madhavrao II. Under the leadership of Mahadaji Shinde, the ruler of the state of Gwalior in central India, the Marathas defeated the Jats, the Rohilla Afghans and took Delhi which remained under Maratha control for the next three decades. His forces conquered modern day Haryana. Shinde was instrumental in resurrecting Maratha power after the débâcle of the Third Battle of Panipat, and in this, he was assisted by Benoît de Boigne.

After the growth in power of feudal lords like the Malwa sardars, the landlords of Bundelkhand and the Rajput kingdoms of Rajasthan who refused to pay tribute to him, he sent his army to conquer states such as Bhopal, Datiya, Chanderi, Narwar, Salbai and Gohad. However, he launched an unsuccessful expedition against the Raja of Jaipur but withdrew after the inconclusive Battle of Lalsot in 1787. The Battle of Gajendragad was fought between the Marathas under the command of Tukojirao Holkar (the adopted son of Malharrao Holkar) and Tipu Sultan from March 1786 to March 1787 in which Tipu Sultan was defeated by the Marathas. By the victory in this battle, the border of the Maratha territory was extended to the Tungabhadra river. The strong fort of Gwalior was then in the hands of Chhatar Singh, the Jat ruler of Gohad. In 1783, Mahadaji besieged the fort of Gwalior and conquered it. He delegated the administration of Gwalior to Khanderao Hari Bhalerao. After celebrating the conquest of Gwalior, Mahadaji Shinde turned his attention to Delhi again.

The Maratha-Sikh treaty in 1785 made the small Cis-Sutlej states an autonomous protectorate of the Scindia Dynasty of the Maratha Confederacy, as Mahadaji Shinde was deputed the &quot;Vakil-i-Mutlaq&quot; (Regent of the empire) of Mughal affairs in 1784. Following the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1806, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington drafted a treaty granting independence to the Sikh clans east of the Sutlej River in exchange for their allegiance to the British General Gerard Lake acting on his dispatch. At the conclusion of the war, the frontier of British India was extended to the Yamuna.

Mahadaji Shinde had conquered Rania, Fatehabad and Sirsa from the governor of Hissar. Haryana then came under the Marathas. He divided Haryana into four territories: Delhi (Mughal emperor Shah Alam II, his family and areas surrounding Delhi), Panipat (Karnal, Sonepat, Kurukshetra and Ambala), Hisar (Hisar, Sirsa, Fatehabad, parts of Rohtak), Ahirwal (Gurugram, Rewari, Narnaul, Mahendragarh) and Mewat. Daulat Rao Scindia ceded Haryana on 30 December 1803 under the Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon to the British East India Company leading to the Company rule in India.

In 1788, Mahadaji&#x27;s armies defeated Ismail Beg, a Mughal noble who resisted the Marathas. The Rohilla chief Ghulam Kadir, Ismail Beg&#x27;s ally, took over Delhi, capital of the Mughal dynasty and deposed and blinded the king Shah Alam II, placing a puppet on the Delhi throne. Mahadaji intervened and killed him, taking possession of Delhi on 2 October restoring Shah Alam II to the throne and acting as his protector. Jaipur and Jodhpur, the two most powerful Rajput states, were still out of direct Maratha domination, so Mahadaji sent his general Benoît de Boigne to crush the forces of Jaipur and Jodhpur at the Battle of Patan. Another achievement of the Marathas was their victories over the Nizam of Hyderabad&#x27;s armies.The last of these took place at the Battle of Kharda in 1795 with all the major Maratha powers jointly fighting Nizam&#x27;s forces.

==== Maratha–Mysore Wars ====
The Marathas came into conflict with Tipu Sultan and his Kingdom of Mysore, leading to the Maratha–Mysore War in 1785. The war ended in 1787 with Tipu Sultan being defeated by the Marathas. The Maratha-Mysore war ended in April 1787 following the finalizing of the &quot;treaty of Gajendragad&quot;, as per which the Tipu Sultan of Mysore was obligated to pay 4.8 million rupees as a war cost to the Marathas and an annual tribute of 1.2 million rupees, in addition to returning all the territory captured by Hyder Ali. In 1791–92, large areas of the Maratha Confederacy suffered a massive population loss due to the Doji bara famine.

In 1791, irregulars like &quot;lamaans&quot; and pindaris of the Maratha army raided and looted the temple of Sringeri &quot;Shankaracharya&quot;, killing and wounding many people, including Brahmins, plundering the monastery of all its valuable possessions, and desecrating the temple by displacing the image of goddess Sāradā. The incumbent &quot;Shankaracharya&quot; petitioned Tipu Sultan for help. A bunch of about 30 letters written in Kannada, which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan&#x27;s court and the Sringeri Shankaracharya were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in Mysore. Tipu Sultan expressed his indignation and grief at the news of the raid:

Tipu Sultan immediately ordered the Asaf of Bednur to supply the Swami with 200 &quot;rahati&quot;s (&quot;fanam&quot;s) in cash and other gifts and articles. Tipu Sultan&#x27;s interest in the Sringeri temple continued for many years, and he was still writing to the Swami in the 1790s.

The Maratha Confederacy soon allied with the British East India Company (based in the Bengal Presidency) against Mysore in the Anglo-Mysore Wars. After the British had suffered a defeat against Mysore in the first two Anglo-Mysore Wars, the Maratha cavalry assisted the British in the last two Anglo-Mysore Wars from 1790 onwards, eventually helping the British conquer Mysore in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799. After the British conquest, however, the Marathas launched frequent raids in Mysore to plunder the region, which they justified as compensation for past losses to Tipu Sultan.

==== British intervention ====


In 1775, the British East India Company, from its base in Bombay, intervened in a succession struggle in Pune, on behalf of Raghunathrao (also called Raghobadada), who wanted to become Peshwa of the confederacy. The British also wanted to end any potential anti-British, French-Maratha alliance at its crib. Maratha forces under Tukojirao Holkar and Mahadaji Shinde defeated a British expeditionary force at the Battle of Wadgaon, but the heavy surrender terms, which included the return of annexed territory and a share of revenues, were disavowed by the British authorities at Bengal and fighting continued. What became known as the First Anglo-Maratha War ended in 1782 with a restoration of the pre-war &quot;status quo&quot; and the East India Company&#x27;s abandonment of Raghunathrao&#x27;s cause.

In 1799, Yashwantrao Holkar was crowned King of the Holkars and he captured Ujjain. He started campaigning towards the north to expand his dominion in that region. Yashwant Rao rebelled against the policies of Peshwa Baji Rao II. In May 1802, he marched towards Pune the seat of the Peshwa. This gave rise to the Battle of Poona in which the Peshwa was defeated. After the Battle of Poona, the flight of the Peshwa left the government of the Maratha state in the hands of Yashwantrao Holkar. He appointed Amrutrao as the Peshwa and went to Indore on 13 March 1803. All except Gaekwad, chief of Baroda, who had already accepted British protection by a separate treaty on 26 July 1802, supported the new regime. He made a treaty with the British. Also, Yashwant Rao successfully resolved the disputes with Scindia and the Peshwa. He tried to unite the Maratha Confederacy but to no avail. In 1802, the British intervened in Baroda to support the heir to the throne against rival claimants and they signed a treaty with the new Maharaja recognising his independence from the Maratha Confederacy in return for his acknowledgement of British paramountcy. Before the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–1805), the Peshwa Baji Rao II signed a similar treaty. The defeat in the Battle of Delhi, 1803 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War resulted in the loss of influence over Delhi for the Marathas.

The Second Anglo-Maratha War represents the military high-water mark of the Marathas who posed the last serious opposition to the formation of the British Raj. The real contest for India was never a single decisive battle for the subcontinent, rather, it turned on a complex social and political struggle for the control of the South Asian military economy. The victory in 1803 hinged as much on finance, diplomacy, politics and intelligence as it did on battlefield manoeuvring and war itself.
Ultimately, the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818) resulted in the loss of Maratha independence. It left the British in control of most of the Indian subcontinent. The Peshwa was exiled to Bithoor (Marat, near Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh) as a pensioner of the British. The Maratha heartland of Desh, including Pune, came under direct British rule, except the states of Kolhapur and Satara, which retained local Maratha rulers (descendants of Shivaji and Sambhaji II ruled over Kolhapur). The Maratha-ruled states of Gwalior, Indore, and Nagpur all lost territory and came under subordinate alliances with the British Raj as princely states that retained internal sovereignty under British paramountcy. Other small princely states of Maratha knights were retained under the British Raj as well.

The Third Anglo-Maratha War was fought by Maratha warlords separately instead of forming a common front and they surrendered one by one. Shinde and the Pashtun Amir Khan were subdued by the use of diplomacy and pressure, which resulted in the Treaty of Gwalior on 5 November 1817. All other Maratha chiefs like Holkars, Bhonsles and the Peshwa gave up arms by 1818. British historian Percival Spear describes 1818 as a watershed year in the history of India, saying that by that year &quot;the British dominion in India became the British dominion of India&quot;.

The war left the British, under the auspices of the British East India Company, in control of virtually all of present-day India south of the Sutlej River. The famed Nassak Diamond was looted by the company as part of the spoils of the war. The British acquired large chunks of territory from the Maratha Empire and in effect put an end to their most dynamic opposition. The terms of surrender Major-general John Malcolm offered to the Peshwa were controversial amongst the British for being too liberal: The Peshwa was offered a luxurious life near Kanpur and given a pension of about 80,000 pounds.

== Geography ==
The Maratha Confederacy, at its peak, encompassed a large area of the Indian sub-continent. At its zenith, it expanded from Punjab in the north to Hyderabad in the south, Kutch in the west to Oudh in the east. It bordered Oudh and Rajputana in the north. Apart from capturing various regions, the Marathas maintained a large number of tributaries who were bound by agreements to pay a certain amount of regular tax, known as Chauth. The confederacy collected defeated the Sultanate of Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, the Nawab of Oudh, the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Nawab of Bengal, Nawab of Sindh and the Nawab of Arcot as well as the Polygar kingdoms of South India. They extracted &quot;chauth&quot; from the rulers in Delhi, Oudh, Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Rajputana. They built up the large empire in India.

The Marathas were requested by Safdarjung, the Nawab of Oudh, in 1752 to help him defeat the Afghani Rohillas. The Maratha force set out from Pune and defeated the Afghan Rohillas in 1752, capturing the whole of Rohilkhand (Bareilly division and Moradabad division of present-day Uttar Pradesh). In 1752, the Marathas entered into an agreement with the Mughal emperor, through his &quot;wazir&quot;, Safdarjung, and the Mughals gave the Marathas the chauth of Doab in addition to the &quot;Subahdari&quot; of Ajmer and Agra. In 1758, Marathas started their north-west conquest and expanded their boundary till Afghanistan. They defeated the Afghan forces of Ahmed Shah Abdali. The Afghans numbered around 25,000–30,000 and were led by Timur Shah, the son of Ahmad Shah Durrani.

During the confederacy era, Mahadaji Shinde resurrected the Maratha domination over much of Northern India which was lost after the Third Battle of Panipat. Delhi and much of Uttar Pradesh were under the suzerainty of the Scindhias of the Maratha Confederacy, but following the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803–1805, the Marathas lost these territories to the British East India Company.

== Territorial evolution ==
== Government and military ==

=== Administration ===


The Ashtapradhan (&quot;The Council of Eight&quot;) was a council of eight ministers that administered the Maratha Kingdom. This system was formed by Shivaji. Ministerial designations were drawn from the Sanskrit language and comprised:

* &quot;Peshwa&quot; or &quot;Pantpradhan&quot; – Prime Minister, general administration of the Empire
* &quot;Amatya&quot; or &quot;Mazumdar&quot; – Finance Minister, managing accounts of the Empire
* &quot;Sachiv&quot; – Secretary, preparing royal edicts
* &quot;Mantri&quot; – Interior Minister, managing internal affairs especially intelligence and espionage
* &quot;Senapati&quot; – Commander-in-Chief, managing the forces and defense of the Empire
* &quot;Sumant&quot; – Foreign Minister, to manage relationships with other sovereigns
* &quot;Nyayadhyaksh&quot; – Chief Justice, dispensing justice on civil and criminal matters
* &quot;Panditrao&quot; – High Priest, managing internal religious matters
* &quot;Chitnis&quot;Personal Secretary and senior writer of the Chhatrapati. Sometimes considered second to the Peshwa in their absence, not in the Ashta Pradhan Mandal but equal to them.

With the notable exception of the priestly &quot;Panditrao&quot; and the judicial &quot;Nyayadisha&quot;, the other &quot;pradhans&quot; held full-time military commands and their deputies performed their civil duties in their stead. In the later era of the Maratha Confederacy, these deputies and their staff constituted the core of the Peshwa&#x27;s bureaucracy.

The Peshwa was the titular equivalent of a modern Prime Minister. Shivaji created the Peshwa designation in order to more effectively delegate administrative duties during the growth of the Maratha Kingdom. Prior to 1749, the Peshwas held office for 8–9 years and controlled the Maratha Army. They later became the &quot;de facto&quot; hereditary administrators of the Maratha Empire from 1749 till its end in 1818.

Under the administration of the Peshwas and with the support of several key generals and diplomats (listed below), the Maratha Empire reached its zenith, ruling most of the Indian subcontinent. It was also under the Peshwas that the Maratha Empire came to its end through its formal annexation into the British Empire by the British East India Company in 1818.

The Marathas used a secular policy of administration and allowed complete freedom of religion.

Shivaji was an able administrator who established a government that included modern concepts such as cabinet, foreign policy and internal intelligence. He established an effective civil and military administration. He believed that there was a close bond between the state and the citizens. He is remembered as a just and welfare-minded king. Cosme da Guarda says of him that:
The Marathas carried out many sea raids, such as plundering Mughal Naval ships and European trading vessels. European traders described these attacks as piracy, but the Marathas viewed them as legitimate targets because they were trading with, and thus financially supporting, their Mughal and Bijapur enemies. After the representatives of various European powers signed agreements with Shivaji or his successors, the threat of plundering or raids against Europeans began to reduce.

=== Military ===

The Maratha Army under Shivaji was a national army consisting of personnel drawn mainly from his empire which corresponds to present-day Maharashtra. It was a homogeneous body commanded by a regular cadre of officers, who had to obey one supreme commander. With the rise of the Peshwas, however, this national army had to make room for a feudal force provided by different Maratha sardars. This new Maratha Army was not homogeneous, but employed soldiers of different backgrounds, both locals and foreign mercenaries, including large numbers of Arabs, Sikhs, Rajputs, Sindhis, Rohillas, Abyssinians, Pashtuns, and Europeans. The army of Nana Fadnavis, for example, included 5,000 Arabs. The army of Baji Rao II included the Pinto brothers Jose Antonio and Francisco from the famous Goan noble family who had escaped Goa after trying to overthrow the government in the Conspiracy of the Pintos.
Some historians have credited the Maratha Navy for laying the foundation of the Indian Navy and bringing significant changes in naval warfare. A series of sea forts and battleships were built in the 17th century during the reign of Shivaji. It has been noted that vessels built in the dockyards of Konkan were mostly indigenous and constructed without foreign aid. Further, in the 18th century, during the reign of Admiral Kanhoji Angre, a host of dockyard facilities were built along the entire western coastline of present-day Maharashtra. The Marathas fortified the entire coastline with sea fortresses with navigational facilities. Nearly all the hill forts, which dot the landscape of present-day western Maharashtra were built by the Marathas. The renovation of Gingee Fort in Tamil Nadu, has been particularly applauded, according to the contemporary European accounts, the defence fortifications matched the European ones.

The Marathas prioritized technical advancement over establishing a modern command structure, resulting in a trade-off. While they excelled as craftsmen and technicians, successfully replicating the latest foreign military technology, their ability to govern as nation-builders was hindered because they struggled to effectively manage the intricate workings of command and failed to address the shortcomings in their general staff system. The fragmented Maratha state was unable to unite due to political divisions, undoing the progress made through technology.

==== Afghan accounts ====

The Maratha Army, especially its infantry, was praised by almost all the enemies of the Maratha Empire, ranging from the Duke of Wellington to Ahmad Shah Abdali. After the Third Battle of Panipat, Abdali was relieved as the Maratha Army in the initial stages were almost in the position of destroying the Afghan armies and their Indian Allies, the Nawab of Oudh and Rohillas. The grand wazir of the Durrani Empire, Sardar Shah Wali Khan was shocked when Maratha commander-in-chief Sadashivrao Bhau launched a fierce assault on the centre of the Durrani Army, over 10,000 Durrani soldiers were killed alongside Haji Atai Khan, one of the chief commander of the Durrani Army and nephew of wazir Shah Wali Khan. Such was the fierce assault of the Maratha infantry in hand-to-hand combat that Afghan armies started to flee and the wazir in desperation and rage shouted, &quot;Comrades whither do you fly, our country is far off&quot;. Post battle, Ahmad Shah Abdali, in a letter to one Indian ruler claimed that Afghans were able to defeat the Marathas only because of the blessings of the almighty and that any other army would have been destroyed by the Maratha army on that particular day even though the Maratha Army was numerically inferior to the Durrani Army and its Indian allies. Though Abdali won the battle, he also had heavy casualties on his side. Hence, he sought immediate peace with the Marathas. Abdali wrote in his letter to Peshwa on 10 February 1761:

==== European accounts ====

Similarly, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, after defeating the Marathas, noted that the Marathas, though poorly led by their generals, had regular infantry and artillery that matched the level of that of the Europeans and warned other British officers from underestimating the Marathas on the battlefield. He cautioned one British general: &quot;You must never allow Maratha infantry to attack head on or in close hand-to-hand combat as in that your army will cover itself with utter disgrace&quot;.

He summarised Maratha tactics as follows: the Mahrattas employ two methods in their operations. They primarily rely on their cavalry to disrupt the enemy&#x27;s supplies, causing distress in their camp and forcing them to retreat. Once the retreat begins, the Mahrattas unleash their infantry and formidable artillery to relentlessly pursue the enemy. By depriving the opponent of provisions, they compel them to hasten their march, while remaining confident in their own safety from counterattacks. They trail the enemy with their cavalry during marches, and when the enemy halts, they encircle and assault them using their infantry and cannons, making escape nearly impossible. Under no circumstances should you allow the enemy to engage you with their infantry. The Mahrattas possess such powerful artillery that it would be impossible to maintain your camp against it. If you receive word of their approach when they are close and ready to attack, it would be advisable to secure your baggage in any way possible and initiate an attack against them. It is crucial to prevent them from launching an attack on your camp at all costs.

Even when Wellesley became the Prime Minister of Britain, he held the Maratha infantry in utmost respect, claiming it to be one of the best in the world. However, at the same time, he noted the poor leadership of Maratha Generals, who were often responsible for their defeats.

Wellesley Charles Metcalfe, one of the ablest of the British Officials in India and later acting Governor-General, wrote in 1806: 

Norman Gash says that the Maratha infantry was equal to that of British infantry. After the Third Anglo-Maratha war in 1818, Britain listed the Marathas as one of the martial races to serve in the British Indian Army. The 19th-century diplomat Sir Justin Sheil commented about the British East India Company copying the French Indian Army in raising an army of Indians:

<text>The Forest of Bowland, also known as the Bowland Fells and formerly the Chase of Bowland, is an area of gritstone fells, deep valleys and peat moorland, mostly in north-east Lancashire, England, with a small part in North Yorkshire (however roughly half of the area falls into the area of the historic West Riding of Yorkshire). It is a western outlier of the Pennines.

The Forest of Bowland was designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1964. The AONB also includes a detached part known as the Forest of Pendle separated from the main part by the Ribble Valley, and anciently a royal forest with its own separate history. One of the best-known features of the area is Pendle Hill, which lies in Pendle Forest. There are more than 500 listed buildings and 18 scheduled monuments within the AONB.

The Trough of Bowland is a pass connecting the valley of the Marshaw Wyre with that of Langden Brook, and dividing the upland core of Bowland into two main blocks.

The hills on the western side of the Forest of Bowland attract walkers from Lancaster and the surrounding area. Overlooking Lancaster is Clougha Pike, the westernmost hill. The hills form a large horseshoe shape with its open end facing west. Clockwise from Lancaster the hills are Clougha Pike (), Grit Fell (), Ward&#x27;s Stone (), Wolfhole Crag (), White Hill (), Whins Brow (), Totridge (), Parlick (), Fair Snape Fell (), Bleasdale Moor (), and Hawthornthwaite Fell ().

The area contains, by one definition, the geographic centre of Great Britain which is close to the Whitendale Hanging Stones, around north of Dunsop Bridge. The historical extent of Bowland Forest is divided into two large administrative townships, Great Bowland (Bowland Forest High and Bowland Forest Low) and Little Bowland (Bowland-with-Leagram), but the modern-day AONB covers a much larger area.

==History==
Possibly a region of the British kingdom of Rheged, Bowland was absorbed into Northumbria in the 7th century. In turn, as Northumbrian influence waned, the westernmost areas of Bowland became part of Amounderness, a territory forged by the Norse &quot;hold&quot; Agmundr, a vassal of Eowils, Halfdan and Ingwaer, co-kings of Jorvik, in the early 10th century.

In 926, Amounderness was annexed by Æthelstan, king of the West Saxons, as a spoil of war. In 934, he granted it to Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York. According to Aethelstan&#x27;s grant, Amounderness at that time stretched &quot;from the sea along the Cocker to the source of that river, from that source straight to another spring which is called in Old English, &quot;Dunshop&quot;, thus down the rivulet to the Hodder, in the same direction to the Ribble and thus along that river through the middle of the channel to the sea&quot;. As such, Amounderness encompassed a significant portion of western and south-western Bowland.

Ekwall thus describes the eastern boundary of Amounderness as &quot;being formed by the fells on the Yorkshire border&quot;; a description which places the ancient boundary firmly within the modern-day Forest of Bowland. While it is difficult to pinpoint &quot;Dunshop&quot;, the confluence of the rivers Dunsop and Hodder at Dunsop Bridge seems a likely locale, situated as it is close to the eastern mouth of the Trough of Bowland, whose Grey Stone marks the line of the pre-1974 county boundary.

Contrary to the popular histories, the origins of the name &quot;Bowland&quot; have nothing to do with archery (&quot;the land of the bow&quot;) or with mediaeval cattle farms or vaccaries (Old Norse, &quot;buu-&quot;, farmstead). The name derives from the Old Norse &quot;boga-/bogi-&quot;, meaning a &quot;bend in a river&quot;. It is a 10th-century coinage used to describe the topography of the Hodder basin, with its characteristic meandering river and brooks.


The Domesday &quot;Bogeuurde&quot; is an instance of this usage – the placename thought to designate Barge Ford (formerly known as Boward), a ford that sits on the wide, pronounced bend of the Hodder at its confluence with Foulscales Brook, due south-west of Newton.

Before the Norman Conquest, Bowland was held by Tostig, son of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. However, as feudal entities, the Forest and Liberty of Bowland were created by William Rufus sometime after Domesday and granted to his vassal Roger de Poitou, possibly to reward Poitou for his role in defeating the Scots army of Malcolm III in 1091–92. In all likelihood, it was this grant that subsumed the eastern portion of Amounderness into the Lordship of Bowland for the first time.

By the end of the 11th century, the Forest and Liberty came into the possession of the De Lacys, Lords of Pontefract. In 1102, along with the grant of the adjacent fee of Clitheroe and further holdings in Hornby and Amounderness, they came to form the basis of what became known as the Honor of Clitheroe.

In 1311, the Honor of Clitheroe was subsumed into the Earldom of Lancaster. Between 1351 and 1661, it was administered as part of the Duchy of Lancaster. By the late 14th century, Bowland comprised a Royal Forest and a Liberty of ten manors spanning eight townships and four parishes and covered an area of almost on the historic borders of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The manors within the Liberty were Slaidburn (Newton-in-Bowland, West Bradford, Grindleton) Knowlmere, Waddington, Easington, Bashall Eaves, Mitton, Withgill (Crook), Leagram, Hammerton and Dunnow (Battersby). Pendle Forest was also part of the Honor of Clitheroe, but administered as part of the Forest of Blackburnshire, entirely in Lancashire.

Gradale, in the northeastern extremity of the forest, grew in population as new land was made available for colonisation. In the mediaeval period, it was a pasture of the Cistercian grange of Rushton on the upper Hodder. In 1537, its manor house, Kirkstall Abbey, was dissolved. Tenements began appearing in the area from the mid-16th century.

By 1650, the lower land of the forest had been almost completely cleared of woods, then divided into small plots, with only the higher land remaining open. Whereas their forebears of the 16th century lived in &quot;crude timber and thatch cottages&quot;, the farmers of the following century were likely inhabiting stone farmhouses.

In October 1652, Parliament had made a survey of the area, when it was an estate of the Duchy of Lancaster formerly belonging to Charles I. The survey showed that the forest was not just a demesne hunting ground, and that, since the 13th century, it had started to become a place of habitation by commoners, including tenant farmers, who had purchased their holdings from James I or Charles I. As farming increased, so did the populousness of the forest. Parks were created for the preservation of the remaining deer. It was one of many such surveys of Crown lands made by the government during the interregnum. The common result of these surveys was that the land was sold off, but the Chase of Bowland (as it was then known) remained under the ownership of the Duchy for a further decade.

In 1661, the 28 manors contained within the former Honor of Clitheroe, including the Forest and Liberty of Bowland, were granted by the Crown to General George Monck as part of the creation of the Dukedom of Albemarle. Monck had been a key figure in the restoration of Charles II. The Lordship of Bowland then descended through the Montagu, Buccleuch and Towneley families.

Bowbearers of the Forest of Bowland have been appointed since the 12th century. A Bowbearer was originally a noble who acted as ceremonial attendant to the Lord of Bowland, latterly the king, by bearing (carrying) his hunting bow, but over the centuries the Bowbearer&#x27;s role underwent many changes. In April 2010, it was reported that the current 16th Lord of Bowland had revived the office of Bowbearer and appointed Robert Redmayne Parker the first Bowbearer of the Forest in almost 150 years.

The Forest of Bowland had its own forest courts –&quot; woodmote&quot; and &quot;swainmote&quot; – from early times. These appear to have been abandoned in the 1830s around the time of Peregrine Towneley&#x27;s acquisition of the Bowland Forest Estate. The halmote court at Slaidburn was disbanded following the abolition of a copyhold by the Law of Property Act in 1922. General forest law in Britain was finally repealed by statute in 1971, more than 900 years after its introduction by the Normans. The original Bowland Forest courts appear to have been held at Hall Hill near Radholme Laund before moving to Whitewell sometime in the 14th century.

The Industrial Revolution had little impact on Bowland, as it had no coal reserves or valleys with fast flowing streams to power wool and cotton industries. There was some small-scale lead mining and lime production, quarrying and paper and cotton mills.

St Hubert, the patron saint of hunting, is also the patron saint of the Forest of Bowland and has a chapel dedicated to him in Dunsop Bridge. This chapel was founded by Richard Eastwood of Thorneyholme, land agent to the Towneley family. Eastwood was the last known Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland. An acclaimed breeder of racehorses and shorthorn cattle, he died in 1871 and is buried at St Hubert&#x27;s.

Considerable areas of the Bowland Fells were used for military training during the Second World War, and there are still unexploded bombs in some areas.

==Ecology==
The name &quot;forest&quot; is used in its traditional sense of &quot;a royal hunting ground&quot;, and rather than being covered by trees, much of the land is heather moorland and blanket bog. In the past wild boar, deer, wolves, wild cats and game roamed the forest. The last herd of wild deer is reported to have been destroyed in 1805.

In recent decades extensive peatland restoration work has been carried out in the AONB , with over 755 hectares of blanket bog being restored since 2010 through the co-operation of estates including Abbeystead estate, which is owned by Grosvenor estates, Whitewell estate, which is owned by the Duchy of Lancaster, United Utility&#x27;s Bowland estate and organisations such as Natural England, Lancashire Wildlife Trusts, Yorkshire Peat Partnership, Wyre Rivers Trust and Ribble Rivers Trust, amongst others. This ongoing work has helped to undo decades of damage caused to the ecology and landscape of the area by bad land management practices.

===Grouse shooting===
Large parts of moorland are still managed for grouse shooting. The Abbeystead estate holds the record for the largest number of grouse killed in one day, when on 12 August 1915, 2,929 birds were shot by just eight hunters.

===Protected areas===
 of the Bowland Fells is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The area is internationally important for its upland bird populations and under the Habitats Directive &quot;Bowland Fells&quot; has been designated a Special Protection Area (designated especially for breeding merlin and hen harrier). Part of the land designated as Bowland Fells SSSI is owned by United Utilities.

===Hen harriers===
The hen harrier is the current symbol of the AONB, although originally this position was occupied by the goshawk, the &#x27;queen of the Forest&#x27;, a hawk that in medieval times was only permitted to be flown by nobility and therefore became emblematic of royal hunting forests such as Bowland. Because the hen harrier is under threat from illegal persecution in the Forest of Bowland and other upland areas of England, with none recorded breeding in England in 2013, this emblem was unofficially modified and adapted to represent the hen harrier instead.

The RSPB takes the view that driven grouse shoots should be licensed so that, for example, crimes committed on estates managed for shooting should result in the withdrawal of their right to operate.

&quot;Bowland Beth: The Life of an English Hen Harrier&quot;, a 2017 book by film director David Cobham, studies the persecution of the hen harrier on the grouse moors of the Forest of Bowland.

====Partial recovery of the species====
In 2014 it was announced that the Forest of Bowland would be one of the SPAs included in a European Union LIFE project designed to ensure a sustainable future for Hen harriers in England and Scotland. Called &quot;Conserving the hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) in northern England and southern and eastern Scotland&quot;, the project aimed to work constructively with landowners and the shooting community. In 2015 a single chick fledged in the Forest.
In 2018 two nests were reported on land belonging to United Utilities. In 2020–22 the work of staff from Natural England and gamekeepers from the area&#x27;s estates, monitored by the RSPB, showed further progress, with 22 hen harriers fledging in 2020, 31 in 2021 and at least 39 in 2022.

==Geography==
Bowland is dominated by a central upland landform (generally above and rising to ) of deeply incised gritstone fells covered with tracts of heather-covered peat moorland and blanket bog. The lower slopes of the fells are dotted with stone-built farms and small villages and are criss-crossed by drystone walls enclosing reclaimed moorland pasture. Steep-sided wooded valleys link the upland and lowland landscapes. In the north-east of the area are extensive coniferous plantations and the eastern limestone areas support high-quality species-rich meadows. Caves in the area include Hell Hole, Whitewell Cave and Whitewell Pot. It is surrounded by the Yorkshire Dales and South Pennines, from which the fells are separated by the Aire Gap and Ribble Valley.

The southern part of the Forest of Bowland is divided by the valley of the River Hodder. West of the river lies a tract of lowland dotted by limestone hills, such as the New Laund and Long Knott. East of the Hodder is a low-lying area known as the Lees. Nearby, higher up, are Browsholme Moor and Burholme Moor.

==Geology==
The Forest of Bowland is formed largely from the succession of sandstones, mudstones and siltstones dating from the late Carboniferous period which constitute the Millstone Grit Group. Early Carboniferous rocks in the form of the limestones and associated rocks of the Craven and Bowland High groups underlie the area at depth and are exposed at the surface around its south-eastern margin. The succession in stratigraphic order (uppermost/youngest at top) is this:
*Millstone Grit Group
**Silsden Formation
***Ward&#x27;s Stone Sandstone (member)
***Roeburndale Member (including the Dure Clough Sandstone)
**Pendleton Formation
***Brennand Grit (member) (corresponds to the Warley Wise Grit or Grassington Grit elsewhere)
***Pendle Grit Member
*Craven Group
**Bowland Shale Formation (mudstone and siltstone)
**Pendleside Limestone Formation (interbedded limestone and mudstone, conglomerate)
**Hodderense Limestone Formation
**Hodder Mudstone Formation (limestone and mudstone)
*Bowland High Group
**Chatburn Limestone Formation (formerly a &#x27;group&#x27;)

The Ward&#x27;s Stone Sandstone forms the peaks and hillsides of Clougha Pike, Ward&#x27;s Stone, Tarnbrook Fell, Wolfhole Crag and Mallowdale Fell whilst the Dure Clough Sandstone forms White Hill, Great Harlow and Lythe Fell. The Brennand Grit forms Bowland Knotts, Great and Little Bull Stones, Whitendale Hanging Stones and parts of Brennand Fell. The Pendle Grit forms almost all of the fells south-west of the Trough of Bowland and all of the south-east of the Forest from Winfold Fell to Croasdale Fell as far east as Gisburn Forest. It also forms Birkett, Waddington, Easington and Grindleton fells, south of Slaidburn.

==Museum and visitor centre==
The Bowland Visitor Centre is located in Beacon Fell Country Park in the AONB. It is managed by Lancashire County Council Countryside Service and provides visitors with information about the AONB and surrounding countryside.

There is a display on the ecology of the Forest of Bowland in Clitheroe Castle Museum.

==Amenities==

One mile to the west of Chipping is Bowland Forest Gliding Club, ICAO airport code GB-0339, which is used by winch-launched gliders.

==Events==
The Bowland Challenge was a fundraising event held from 2006 to 2009, and again in 2011, in which teams of walkers navigated around a series of grid references over a ten-hour period. It raised funds for the Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue Team. Crafty Vintage Festive Markets take place every year in December within Wyresdale Park near to the village of Scorton. Nicky Nook Fell hosts a road stage with spectator viewing zones along the route of the North West Stages car rally.

Popular annual events held in the area&#x27;s many villages and communities include Chipping Steam Fair, the Hodder Valley Show, Slaidburn Steam and Vintage Vehicle display, and Wray Scarecrow Festival, amongst others.

==In culture==

* Jane Routh&#x27;s 2014 collection of poetry &quot;Falling into Place&quot; is set in the Forest of Bowland.
* Dennis Watkins-Pitchford&#x27;s 1955 steampunk fantasy &quot;Forest of Boland Light Railway&quot; is set in the aforementioned forest.
* Wyresdale Park featured on Drew Pritchard&#x27;s &quot;Salvage Hunters&quot; in 2017.
* In September 2011, Wyresdale Park featured on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Country House Rescue&quot;, in the first episode of Series 3.

<doc id="349072" wikidata="Q707887" url="?curid=349072" title="You Si-kun">
<text>You Si-kun (; born 25 April 1948), also romanized Yu Shyi-kun, is a Taiwanese politician. He was one of the founding members of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and is known to be a strong advocate of Taiwan independence. He led the DPP as chairman from 2006 to 2007 and served as Premier from 2002 to 2005.

== Personal background ==
Born in Taihe Village (太和村), Dongshan Township, Yilan County, You was raised in a poor tenant farming family. While he was a 13-year-old student at Taiwan Provincial Yilan High School, his house was destroyed by flood waters during typhoon Pamela and his father died of tuberculosis in the same year. As a result, he quit junior high school to work full-time on his family farm.

At 19, he enrolled in supplementary night school at Lotung Commercial and Vocational High School. He moved to Taipei to enroll in the supplementary Hsihu Commercial and Industrial High School. He studied international commerce at the Chihlee Institute of Technology and public administration at the National Chung Hsing University. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in politics in Tunghai University in 1985 at the age of 37.

== Rise in politics ==
In 1981, he was elected a member of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly for Yilan County. You, Su Tseng-chang, and made the so-called &quot;iron triangle&quot; in the Assembly. The three were the only members ever to resign from the Assembly.

From 1983 to 1984 he was the Tangwai Secretary-General. He became Convener of Tangwai National Election Backing Committee in 1986. As a founding member of the Democratic Progressive Party, he was a member of its Central Committee from 1984 to 1986 and its Central Standing Committee from 1986 to 1990 when he was elected the Magistrate of Yilan County, during which he was a member of the Educational Reform Committee of the Executive Yuan from 1994 to 1996. In his second term as magistrate, Environmental Protection (環保立縣), Tourism (觀光立縣), Information Promotion (資訊立縣), and Culture (文化立縣) were his four main goals in administration. After the completion of his two terms as magistrate in 1997, he was in 1998 appointed Chairman of the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation by then Mayor Chen Shui-bian. He resigned in 1999 to become Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party.

He was the chief spokesman for the DPP campaign in the 2000 presidential election. With Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s election to the presidency, he was appointed Vice Premier under Premier Tang Fei.

In July 2000, four construction workers were trapped by the rising floodwaters of Pachang Creek. As local and central government authorities squabbled for three hours over who would send out a rescue helicopter, the men drowned. In the public outrage that ensued, officials up the chain of command, including Premier Tang, tendered their resignations. Vice Premier You, who was also chairman of the Committee of Disaster Relief and Prevention, had his resignation accepted.

Six months later, You rejoined the administration as Secretary-General to the Office of the President and served until his promotion to the premiership on 1 February 2002.

== Premiership ==
As premier, You defended the administration&#x27;s position on the peace referendum and promoted a NT$610.8 billion arms procurement package in 2004. He caused some minor controversy when he used the designation &quot;Taiwan, ROC&quot; on an official visit to Honduras. Chen later said he preferred &quot;Taiwan.&quot; In September 2004, he directed the government to refer to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in official documents as simply &quot;China&quot; as opposed to &quot;mainland China&quot; or &quot;Communist China&quot; as was previously done in order to highlight a &quot;separate Taiwanese identity.&quot; This move was not endorsed by the Presidential Office and the Mainland Affairs Council clarified that it would only apply to internal documents.

You and his cabinet resigned &quot;en masse&quot; following the pan-Green Coalition failure to gain a majority in the 2004 legislative elections. In the ensuing cabinet shuffle, You was returned to the presidential office as secretary-general and succeeded as premier by Frank Hsieh.

On 15 January 2006 he was elected chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party with 54% of the vote.

You was a candidate for the DPP nomination for the 2008 presidential election, competing against Frank Hsieh, Su Tseng-chang, and Annette Lu. He finished third in the first round of the primary and subsequently withdrew along with the other trailing candidates, paving the way for the leading candidate Hsieh to win the nomination without a need for a second round which would have been based on opinion polling.

== Corruption charges and acquittal ==
On 21 September 2007, You, along with Vice President Annette Lu and National Security Office secretary-general Mark Chen, were separately indicted on charges of corruption by the Supreme Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Taiwan. You was accused of embezzlement and special fund abuse of about US$70,000. He resigned his post as chairperson of the Democratic Progressive Party later that day. On 2 July 2012, all three were acquitted of all charges.

== 2014 New Taipei City mayoralty election ==
On 29 November 2014, You lost the New Taipei City mayoralty election to his opponent Eric Chu of the Kuomintang.

== Later political career ==
You was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 2020, securing an at-large seat on behalf of the Democratic Progressive Party. He was elected President of the Legislative Yuan on February 1, 2020, defeating Kuomintang lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao and succeeding Su Jia-chyuan. Speaking at the 2020 Taipei Traditional Chinese Medicine International Forum on July 5, 2020, You Si-kun suggested renaming Chinese medicine as &quot;Taiwanese&quot;. On November 5, 2021, You was sanctioned by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People&#x27;s Republic of China for &quot;fanning up hostility across the Taiwan Strait and maliciously smearing the mainland&quot;.

You reelected to the Legislative Yuan in 2024, again via party list proportional representation, and ran for a second speakership term. He lost the office to Han Kuo-yu and subsequently resigned from the 11th Legislative Yuan.

== Personal life ==
You is the founder of &quot;Kavalan Journal&quot; (噶瑪蘭雜誌), which is named after the Kavalan Taiwanese aborigines.

He married Yang Pao-yu in 1978, with whom he has two sons. His mother, Huang Shou-chu, died in December 2002.

<doc id="349075" wikidata="Q1056535" url="?curid=349075" title="Hida Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area that is today the northern portion of Gifu Prefecture in the Chūbu region of Japan. Hida bordered on Echizen, Mino, Shinano, Etchū, and Kaga Provinces. It was part of Tōsandō Circuit. Its abbreviated name was . Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Hida was ranked as an &quot;inferior country&quot; (下国) and a middle country (中国) in terms of its importance and distance from the capital. Currently, the entire area of the former Hida Province consists of the cities of Hida, Takayama and most of the city of Gero, and the village of Shirakawa, in Ōno District .

== Overview ==
&quot;Hida&quot; indicates the west side of the Hida Mountains. The climate is similar to that of the provinces of the Sea of Japan, with extremely heavy snow in winter. Hida traditionally had strong economic and cultural ties with the neighboring Etchū Province due to the ease of transportation and poor connections to the Pacific coast, from which it was blocked by mountain ranges and poor transportation. Historically the region was written as &quot;Yota&quot; or &quot;Wita&quot;. This notation still is present and it can be seen in titles such as &quot;Yuta High School&quot; etc.

==History==
===Ancient and classical Hida===
Hida existed as a political entity before the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system and the implementation of the Taihō Code of the Nara period. Ancient Hida was governed by a Kuni no miyatsuko, but the area was so depopulated, a tax exception was granted. By the Nara period, the area was already so noted for its carpentry that the official court position of &quot;Hida-no-takumi&quot; (飛騨工) consisting of two craftsmen from Hida Province was established. The ruins of the provincial capital of the province have been located in &quot;Kokufu-cho&quot; of the city of Takayama, and the provincial temple, Hida Kokubun-ji is also located in the city, as is the province&#x27;s &quot;ichinomiya&quot;, the Minashi Shrine.

During the Heian and Kamakura period, Hida&#x27;s extensive forests were a major source of timber and metals for other provinces. River traffic from Hida down to Mino Province and Owari Province was heavy. By the Muromachi period, the Kyōgoku clan held the position of &quot;shugo&quot; for many generations; however, towards the start of the Sengoku period, the province was fragmented into many small warlord territories, with the province as a whole becoming contested territory between the powerful Takeda clan based in Kai Province and the Uesugi clan based in Echigo Province. The &quot;Ikkō-ikki&quot; movement from neighboring Kaga and Etchū Provinces also added to the instability.

===Medieval and pre-modern Hida===
During the Sengoku period, the Miki clan changed its name to Anenokōji and temporarily unified the Hida area. After the Honnō-ji Incident, Kanamori Nagachika, one of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s and later Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s generals, was sent to occupy Hida Province and became its &quot;daimyō&quot;. He built Takayama Castle and later fought on the side of Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara. As a result, he was reconfirmed as &quot;daimyō&quot; of Takayama Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate with a &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 38,000 &quot;koku&quot;. His heirs ruled Takayama for six generations, until Kanamori Yoritoki was transferred to Kaminoyama Domain in Dewa Province in 1692.

From 1692 until the end of the Edo period, Hida Province was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory ruled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. The official in charge of Hida was the . Initially, this was a &quot;daikon&quot;-level position located at a &quot;daikansho&quot; built on the site of the &quot;shimoyashiki&quot; of Takayama Castle and was held by 11 men from 1692 to 1765. The &quot;daikansho&quot; was then elevated to that of a &quot;jin&#x27;ya&quot; and the final 14 holders of the office were styled &quot;Gundai&quot; rather than &quot;Daikan&quot;. The Takayama &quot;jin&#x27;ya&quot; has the distinction of being the only &quot;jin&#x27;ya&quot; on &quot;tenyrō&quot; territory. The area under its control consisted of 414 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 57,182 &quot;koku&quot;.

===Meiji period and beyond===
Following the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the han system in 1871, the post of &quot;Hida Gundai&quot; was also abolished. The area was divided into three districts and was renamed &quot;Hida Prefecture&quot; on July 12, 1868. Ten days later, it was renamed &quot;Takayama Prefecture&quot; and on December 31, 1871, became &quot;Chikuma Prefecture&quot;. On August 21, 1876, Chikuma was merged with the former Mino Province to become Gifu Prefecture.

Also in this era, the Hida region became a center for the nationally important silk-making industry, leading to many women traveling there from the surrounding regions for work.

==Historical districts==
Hida Province consisted of three districts:

* Gifu Prefecture

<doc id="349077" wikidata="Q202934" url="?curid=349077" title="Hattrick (video game)">
<text>Hattrick is a browser-based massively multiplayer online football management simulation video game developed in Sweden and launched on 30 August 1997. The game contains 144 countries plus the Hattrick International (only for paying HT-Supporters), each with its own league pyramid, and 53 different language versions. As of October 8th 2022, the community of the game has 201,895 users worldwide, each with their own team. The number peaked in February 2009 with almost one million users. &quot;Hattrick&quot; has arranged 82 seasons as of November 2022, each lasting four months.

The game is free to play, though there is an optional premium supporter service that provides additional features, as well as a mobile service, both available by in-game purchase. As with any manager game, the player must assign positions to the players and choose among various tactical and strategic options. As stated by third-party web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb, &quot;Hattrick&quot; is rated as the 360th and 584th most visited website in Italy respectively. In 2015, SimilarWeb rated the site as the most visited fantasy sports website globally, attracting almost 4.6 million visitors per month.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay revolves around managing a football team, tasking the player with buying and selling players, setting the team&#x27;s lineup, or expanding the arena to the perfect size, with each player having a team of their own. Many types of teams exist within &quot;Hattrick&quot;, with team types shaped by the training program set up by the player, as well as the formations played. Each included country has a league, which is divided into series. The series below the main divisions are also groups, where teams play each other in two legs, the number of sets and groups are defined according to the number of users in the country. Each included country also has a national cup that is played by all teams through a knockout system. The winners of the top division and cup of each country gain spots in the Hattrick Masters.

== Development ==
In April 2012, Hattrick Holdings was purchased by Zattikka, a casual gaming developer based in the United Kingdom, as part of its strategy to acquire established but &quot;under-exploited&quot; online games. As a preparation for the sale to Zattikka, the developers declared that they would not improve core features of the game for the foreseeable future (for example, postponing the announced new staff system), but instead focus on improving the experience for newer players coming into the game, as well as attracting new members and adding things, such as Hattrick gears, that users can pay for. The philosophy to not be able to pay for success still stands. In August 2013 the former owner group of &quot;Hattrick&quot; (which includes HT-Johan and HT-Daniel) reached an agreement with Zattikka to buy back the game.

== Reception ==
&quot;Hattrick&quot; has been studied academically, for example being used in a University of Helsinki case study into whether online simulation games, such as &quot;Hattrick&quot;, could be used as a business model for online betting and gambling businesses. The conclusion was &quot;Online gambling on simulated sport events is a very interesting proposition with good prospects in the future; further research and piloting projects are however needed before one can give any conclusive answer to the actual future value of such services.&quot;

It has also been used as the basis for a Lund University academic paper, &quot;Time Extraction from Real-time Generated Football Reports&quot;, presented at the Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics in Tartu, Estonia in 2007.

== History ==
Hattrick was launched on 30 August 1997. Initially, Swedish was the only language available. In early 2000, the game development company Hattrick Extralives was founded.

In May 2001, the company presented Hattrick Supporter, a premium service that would be the main source of income for the company.

In February 2008, Hattrick launched a board game called Match of the Season. In 2011, Hattrick was voted the Most Favourite Simulation Game of 2011.

<doc id="349080" wikidata="Q389129" url="?curid=349080" title="Cumberlandite">
<text>Cumberlandite is a specific type of plutonic rock called a melanocratic troctolite, or melatroctolite. It is the state rock of Rhode Island and can be found in a lot in Cumberland, Rhode Island at Iron Mine Hill. Further traces can be found scattered throughout the Narragansett Bay watershed as far as Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Cumberlandite is not exclusive to Rhode Island, but is also found in Taberg, Sweden. It is slightly ferrimagnetic due to its high concentration of iron.

==Background==
Colonial settlers recognized its value as ore during the 18th and 19th centuries. Historical records reveal that it was smelted as early as 1703, and it was used in forging cannons during significant events such as the Siege of Louisbourg in 1745 and possibly the American Revolutionary War.

Cumberlandite weathers to a brownish black with white crystals and has secondary chlorite and saussurite. It is predominantly found in glacial deposits stretching from south of its origin to the southern shores of Narragansett. Cumberlandite is denser than common granites or metamorphic rocks. Its unique origin, distinct appearance, and ease of identification contributed to its selection as the Rhode Island state rock.

==Petrology==

Cumberlandite is an uncommon mafic igneous rock known as a melanocratic troctolite, or by IUGS classification, titaniferous magnetite melatroctolite.

Bulk rock geochemistry shows the below analysis with trace Pb:

Troctolites are unusual olivine-rich pyroxene-poor gabbros common in layered mafic intrusions believed to have formed as cumulates in a magma chamber. Cumberlandite has light phenocrysts of labradorite in a dark, fine to medium-grained matrix of magnetite, ilmenite, olivine, and hercynite spinel. Magnetite and ilmenite cumulates are also common in layered intrusions and these minerals can account for up to 70 percent of the rock&#x27;s volume contributing to the rock&#x27;s high density and magnetism. The preferred orientation of the plagioclase crystals gives the rock a lamination.

The rock is part of the Esmond-Dedham Subterrane with an uncertain age ranging widely from Late Proterozoic to around the Devonian. He-Magnetite dating suggest an improbable age of 1.5Ga. Given its chemical composition and the presence of inclusions from a nearby gabbro, experts believe the rock is mid-Paleozoic.

<doc id="349083" wikidata="Q1054838" url="?curid=349083" title="Kōzuke Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of Japan that is today Gunma Prefecture. Kōzuke bordered Echigo, Shinano, Musashi and Shimotsuke Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Kōzuke was ranked as one of the 13 &quot;great countries&quot; (大国) in terms of importance, and one of the 30 &quot;far countries&quot; (遠国) in terms of distance from the imperial capital, Kyoto. The provincial capital is located in what is now the city of Maebashi; however, its exact location remains uncertain. The ichinomiya of the province is located in what is now the city of Tomioka.

==History==
During the 4th century AD, (Kofun period) the area of modern Gunma and Tochigi prefectures were known as , literally &quot;hairy field&quot;, but used as ateji for or &quot;food field&quot; in reference to an imperial agricultural area. At some unknown point in the 5th century, the area was divided at the Kinugawa River into (&quot;Upper Keno&quot;) and (&quot;Lower Keno&quot;). Per the Nara period Taihō Code, these provinces became and . At some point, the &quot;no&quot; meaning &quot;field&quot; was reanalyzed as the possessive particle &quot;no&quot;, resulting in shortened names (without the or &quot;province&quot; portion) of &quot;Kamitsuke&quot; and &quot;Shimotsuke&quot;. In 713, with the standardization of province names into two &quot;kanji&quot;, these names became and . Later regular sound changes caused &quot;Kamitsuke&quot; to shift to &quot;Kaudzuke&quot;, and then to modern &quot;Kōzuke&quot;.

During the Heian period, from the year 811, Kōzuke (along with Hitachi and Kazusa) was one of the three provinces where an Imperial Prince was designated as nominal ruler. The area was noted for its production of horses. The original capital of the province was located in what is now Maebashi, along with the kokubun-ji and the sōja of the province. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; was located in what is now the city of Tomioka.

During the Sengoku period, Kōzuke was contested between the later Hōjō clan, the Takeda and the Uesugi clans. After the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, much of the province was assigned to several feudal domains. The Nakasendō and the Mikuni Kaidō highways passed through the province, and numerous post stations were established.

Following the Meiji restoration, the various domains became prefectures with the abolition of the han system in 1871. These various prefectures merged to form Gunma Prefecture in 1876. The area subsequently prospered with the development of sericulture and silk spinning industries.

<doc id="349084" wikidata="Q206421" url="?curid=349084" title="Konstantinos Stephanopoulos">
<text>Konstantinos &quot;Kostis&quot; Stephanopoulos (, 15 August 1926 – 20 November 2016) was a Greek conservative politician who served two consecutive terms as the president of Greece from 1995 to 2005.

==Life and career==

Stephanopoulos was born in Patras on 15 August 1926 to the lawyer and radiologist People&#x27;s Party Member of Parliament, and Vrisiis Philopoulou. After attending the Saint Andrew school of Patras, he studied law at Athens University. He practiced law from 1954 until 1974 as a member of the Patras Bar Association.

He first stood for election in 1958, with the National Radical Union and was elected for the first time as MP for Achaea Prefecture in 1964. He was re-elected for the same constituency for New Democracy (ND) in 1974, 1977, 1981 and 1985. He served as ND parliamentary secretary and parliamentary spokesman from 1981 to 1985.

In 1974, Stephanopoulos was appointed Deputy Minister of Commerce in the National Unity government of Constantine Karamanlis. For the next seven years, he served in a number of ministerial posts in New Democracy governments; Minister for the Interior from November 1974 to September 1976; Minister for Social Services from September 1976 to November 1977 and Minister for the Presidency from 1977 to 1981.

In August 1985 he resigned from ND after a disagreement with Konstantinos Mitsotakis and on 6 September formed Democratic Renewal (DIANA). He was elected Member of Parliament for Athens in the 1989 elections while continuing as the leader of DIANA, until it disbanded in June 1994.

On 8 March 1995, after being nominated by the conservative Political Spring party and supported by the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), he was elected President of Greece, winning the election on a third ballot of MPs with 181 votes. He was the fifth person to hold the post since the restoration of democratic rule in 1974. He was re-elected on 8 February 2000 on the first ballot, after receiving the support of 269 of the 298 MPs present. He remained in office until 2 March 2005, when he was succeeded by Karolos Papoulias.

As a President he was known for his low-key profile, unifying approach to current and international affairs, and gentlemanly behaviour. During his presidency, he was consistently the most popular public figure in Greece.

As head of state of the host country in the Opening Ceremony, he is the first President of the Hellenic Republic officially declare open the 2004 Summer Olympics of Athens, the Olympic Homecoming of the modern era on 13 August 2004. Stephanopoulos was accompanied by Adjutant to the President of the Hellenic Republic, Air Force Colonel Georgios Dritsakos.

Stephanopoulos died in Henry Dunant Hospital, Athens, on 20 November 2016 at the age of 90. He had been hospitalised three days earlier, suffering from fever and severe respiratory difficulty, which later emerged as pneumonia.

==Family==
Stephanopoulos was married for 29 years to Tzeni Stounopoulou, who died in 1988. The couple had three children.

<doc id="349087" wikidata="Q1053699" url="?curid=349087" title="Shimotsuke Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of Japan that is today Tochigi Prefecture. Shimotsuke was bordered by Kōzuke, Hitachi, Mutsu and Shimōsa Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Shimotsuke was ranked as one of the 13 &quot;great countries&quot; (大国) in terms of importance, and one of the 30 &quot;far countries&quot; (遠国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital is located in what is now the city of Tochigi. The Ichinomiya of the province is the Futarasan jinja located in what is now the city of Utsunomiya.


==History==
During the 4th century AD, (Kofun period) the area of modern Gunma and southern Tochigi prefectures were known as . At some unknown point in the 5th century, the area was divided at the Kinugawa River into and . Per the Nara period Taihō Code, these provinces became and . In 713, with the standardization of province names into two &quot;kanji&quot;, these names became and .

The area of Shimotsuke is mentioned frequently in the Nara period &quot;Rikkokushi&quot;, including the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and had strong connections with the Yamato court since the Kofun period. A large Buddhist temple complex, the Shimotsuke Yakushi-ji, located in what is now the city of Tochigi, dates from the Nara period.

From the Heian period, the area was dominated by a number of samurai bands, including the Utsunomiya clan, and the Nasu clan. A branch of the Minamoto clan, the Ashikaga rose to prominence during the Kamakura period from their &quot;shōen&quot; at what is now Ashikaga, and went on to create the Ashikaga shogunate of the Muromachi period.

During the Sengoku period, Shimotsuke was contested between the later Hōjō clan, the Takeda and the Uesugi clans. After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, much of the province was assigned to several feudal domains. Tokugawa Ieyasu and Tokugawa Iemitsu chose the sacred site of Nikkō to be the location of their tombs, and thus the area prospered as a site of pilgrimage through the end of the Edo period.

The Nikkō Kaidō and the Ōshū Kaidō highways passed through the province, and numerous post stations were established.

Following the Meiji Restoration, the various domains became prefectures with the abolition of the han system in 1871. These various prefectures merged to form Tochigi Prefecture in 1873.

==Historical districts==
Shimotsuke Province consisted of ten districts:

* Tochigi Prefecture
** Ashikaga District (足利郡) – absorbed Yamada District on April 1, 1896; later dissolved
** Aso District (安蘇郡)- dissolved
** Haga District (芳賀郡)
** Kawachi District (河内郡)
** Nasu District (那須郡)
** Samukawa District (寒川郡) – merged into Shimotsuga District on April 1, 1889
** Shioya District (塩谷郡)
** Tsuga District (都賀郡)
*** Kamitsuga District (上都賀郡) – dissolved
*** Shimotsuga District (下都賀郡) – absorbed Samukawa District on April 1, 1889

<text>was a province of Japan comprising modern-day Yamagata Prefecture and Akita Prefecture, except for the city of Kazuno and the town of Kosaka. Dewa bordered on Mutsu and Echigō Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was .
==History==

===Early period===
Prior to the Asuka period, Dewa was inhabited by Ainu or Emishi tribes, and was effectively outside of the control of the imperial dynasty. Abe no Hirafu conquered the native Emishi tribes at what are now the cities of Akita and Noshiro in 658 and established a fort on the Mogami River. In 708 AD was created within Echigō Province. The area of Dewa District was roughly that of the modern Shōnai area of Yamagata Prefecture, and was gradually extended to the north as the Japanese pushed back the indigenous people of northern Honshū. Dewa District was promoted to the status of a province () in 712 AD, and gained Okitama and Mogami Districts, formerly part of Mutsu Province.

A number of military expeditions were sent to the area, with armed colonists forming settlements with wooden palisades across central Dewa in what is now the Shōnai area of Yamagata Prefecture. The capital of the new province was initially established at Dewanosaku (出羽柵), a fortified settlement in what is now part of Sakata, Yamagata, which served as a vital military stronghold in the expansion of Yamato control and settlement in the region. In 733, the capital was moved north, and a new military settlement, later named &quot;Akita Castle&quot;, was built what is now in the Takashimizu area of the city of Akita. Abe no Yakamaro was sent as Chinjufu-shōgun. In 737, a major military operation began to connect Akita Castle with Taga Castle on the Pacific Coast. Over the next 50 years, additional fortifications were erected at Okachi in Dewa Province and Monofu in Mutsu Province involving a force of over 5000 men. The road was greatly resented by the Emishi tribes, and after an uprising in 767, pacification expeditions were carried out in 776, 778, 794, 801 and 811.

During the Nara period, under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Dewa was ranked as a &quot;greater country&quot; (上国). Under the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system, Dewa was classed as a &quot;far country&quot; (遠国). The name of the province was originally pronounced &quot;Idewa&quot;. The Ichinomiya of Dewa Province was the Chōkaisan Ōmonoimi Shrine in what is now Yuza, Yamagata.

During the Heian period, in 878, a major rebellion known as the erupted in the region against Yamato rule. Another major uprising occurred in 939, as part of East Japan war Tengyō no Ran. Towards the end of the Heian period, the province was organized into eleven districts. It was later a battleground in the Gosannen War and the Former Nine Years War.

===Medieval period===
Following the destruction of the Northern Fujiwara clan by the forces of the Kamakura shogunate in 1189, many Fujiwara partisans fled to the mountains of Dewa and continued to resist central authority. The area was divided into numerous shōen during the Kamakura period, which developed into the centers of numerous rival samurai clans. In 1335, Shiba Kaneyori received the Dewa Province as a fief from Ashikaga Takauji, but ruled it only in name. By the end of the Sengoku period, the Mogami clan had emerged as the strongest local force in the southern portion of the province, whereas the Akita clan dominated the northern portion of the province. Both clans sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara, and were thus secured in their holdings at the start of the Tokugawa shogunate.

===Early modern period===
During the early Edo period, both the Mogami and the Akita were dispossessed, and their territories broken up into smaller domains, the largest of which were held by the Sakai clan and Uesugi clans. During the Bakumatsu period, all of the domains in the area joined the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei supporting the Tokugawa shogunate. Following the defeat of the pro-Tokugawa forces, the new Meiji government reorganized Dewa province into in the north, and in the south in 1868.These provinces became Akita Prefecture and Yamagata Prefecture on August 2, 1876.

<doc id="349094" wikidata="Q907389" url="?curid=349094" title="Mutsu Province">
<text>was an old province of Japan in the area of Fukushima, Miyagi, Iwate and Aomori Prefectures and the municipalities of Kazuno and Kosaka in Akita Prefecture.

Mutsu Province is also known as or . The term is often used to refer to the combined area of Mutsu and the neighboring province Dewa, which together make up the entire Tōhoku region.

==History==

===Invasion by the Kinai government===
Mutsu, on northern Honshū, was one of the last provinces to be formed as land was taken from the indigenous Emishi, and became the largest as it expanded northward. The ancient regional capital of the Kinai government was Tagajō in present-day Miyagi Prefecture.

* 709 (&quot;Wadō 2, 3rd month&quot;), an uprising against governmental authority took place in Mutsu and in nearby Echigo Province. Troops were dispatched to subdue the revolt.
* 712 (&quot;Wadō 5&quot;), Mutsu was separated from Dewa Province. Empress Genmei&#x27;s &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; made cadastral changes in the provincial map of the Nara period, as in the following year when Mimasaka Province was split from Bizen Province, Hyūga Province was sundered from Ōsumi Province, and Tanba Province was severed from Tango Province.
* 718, Shineha, Uda and Watari districts of the Mutsu Province, Kikuta, Iwaki districts of the Hitachi Province are incorporated into Iwaki Province (718).
* 801, Mutsu was conquered by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro.
* 869 (&quot;Jōgan 10, 5th month&quot;): A terrible earthquake struck Mutsu. More than 1,000 people lost their lives in the disaster.

===Prosperity of Hiraizumi===
In 1095, the Ōshū Fujiwara clan settled at Hiraizumi, under the leadership of Fujiwara no Kiyohira. Kiyohira hoped to &quot;form a city rivaling Kyoto as a centre of culture&quot;. The legacy of the Ōshū Fujiwara clan remains with the temples Chūson-ji and Mōtsū-ji in Hiraizumi, and the Shiramizu Amidadō temple building in Iwaki. In 1189, Minamoto no Yoritomo invaded Mutsu with three great forces, eventually killing Fujiwara no Yasuhira and acquiring the entire domain.

===Sengoku period===
During the Sengoku period, clans ruled parts of the province.

*The Nanbu clan at Morioka in the north.
*The Date clan at Iwadeyama and Sendai in the south.
*The Sōma clan at Nakamura in the south.
*The Iwaki clan at Iinodaira in the south.
*The Uesugi clan had a castle town at Wakamatsu in the south.

===After the Boshin War===

As a result of the Boshin War, Mutsu Province was divided by the Meiji government, on 19 January 1869, into five provinces: Iwashiro, Iwaki, Rikuzen, Rikuchū, and Rikuō). The fifth of these, corresponding roughly to today&#x27;s Aomori Prefecture, was assigned the same two kanji as the entire province prior to division; however, the character reading was different. Due to the similarity in characters in the name, this smaller province has also sometimes been referred to as &#x27;Mutsu&#x27;.

<text>was an old province in the area that is today Fukushima Prefecture and Miyagi Prefecture.

==History==
This iteration of Iwaki Province lasted for a brief period of time in Nara period. Established in 718 with the division of Mutsu Province, it was composed of the five districts of Iwaki (石城), Shineha (標葉), Namekata (行方), Uta (宇太), Watari (曰理) and Kikuta (菊多). Only Kikuta district was given from Hitachi Province. Abolished and returned to Mutsu sometime between 722 and 724. Kikuta moved to Mutsu at that time.

<text>is an old province of Japan which existed for a brief period of time in the Nara period in what is now western Fukushima Prefecture.

==History==
Iwase Province was created during the reign of Empress Genshō. The Yōrō Ritsuryo established the Iwase Province in 718 through the division of the Michinoku Province (Mutsu Province). It was composed of five districts, named Shirakawa (白河), Iwase (石背), Aizu (会津), Asaka (安積) and Shinobu (信夫).

The area encompassed by the province reverted to Mutsu at some point between 722 and 724. Some scholars have suggested that this may have been motivated by economic considerations.

<doc id="349110" wikidata="Q4949922" url="?curid=349110" title="Boundary commissions (United Kingdom)">
<text>In the United Kingdom, the boundary commissions are non-departmental public bodies responsible for determining the boundaries of parliamentary constituencies for elections to the House of Commons. There are four boundary commissions: one each for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Each commission comprises four members, three of whom take part in meetings. The speaker of the House of Commons chairs each of the boundary commissions &quot;ex officio&quot; but does not play any part in the review, and a High Court judge is appointed to each boundary commission as deputy chair.

==Considerations and process==

The boundary commissions, which are required to report every eight years, must apply a set series of rules when devising constituencies. These rules are set out in the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, as amended by the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 and subsequently by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020.

Firstly, each proposed constituency has to comply with two numerical limits:
* the electorate (number of registered voters) of each constituency must be within 5% of the United Kingdom electoral quota. The electoral quota is the average number of electors per constituency, defined as the total mainland electorate divided by the number of mainland constituencies, where &quot;mainland&quot; excludes five island constituencies: Orkney and Shetland,  (Western Isles), Ynys Môn (Isle of Anglesey) and two on the Isle of Wight. The total number of constituencies is fixed at 650.
* the area of a constituency must be no more than .

There are a small number of exceptions to the numerical limit on electorate which are specified in the legislation:
* the five island constituencies are permitted to have a smaller electorate than the usual limit;
* a constituency with an area of more than may have a smaller electorate than the usual limit; and
* constituencies in Northern Ireland may be subject to slightly different limits under certain circumstances.

Having satisfied the electorate and area requirements, each commission can also take into account a number of other factors:
* &quot;special geographical considerations&quot; including the size, shape and accessibility of a constituency; 
* local government boundaries;
* boundaries of existing constituencies;
* local ties which would be broken by changes to constituencies;
* inconveniences resulting from changes to constituencies.

As these factors can to an extent be mutually conflicting, each commission has discretion on how it applies them. In so doing, each commission aims for a consistent approach within a review.

When a commission publishes its proposals for public consultation, the consultation periods are specified in the legislation:
* an eight-week initial written consultation period following the publication of Initial Proposals;
* a six-week secondary consultation period allowing scrutiny of all comments submitted during the initial consultation and including a number of public hearings which offer an opportunity to give views orally;
* a four-week consultation period following publication of Revised Proposals.

It has been normal practice for local government electoral wards to be used as building blocks for constituencies, although there is no legislative requirement to do so. In some metropolitan boroughs in England, and in Scotland, following the introduction of multi-member wards in 2007, it is often difficult to do so due to the large electorates in these wards, and therefore a collection of complete wards may not give an electorate that is within the required electoral range.

The law specifies that the electorate used during a review is the registered electorate at the time of the start of the review, and not the electorate at the end of a review, or the total population.

Boundary changes can have a significant effect on the results of elections, but boundary commissions do not take any account of voting patterns in their deliberations, or consider what the effect of their recommendations on the outcome of an election may be.

===Implementation of recommendations===

Once a commission has completed its review, it submits a report to the appropriate Secretary of State who lays it before Parliament. Once all four reports have been submitted, an Order in Council which gives effect to the recommendations must be submitted within four months to the Privy Council. The Government may not modify any of the commissions&#x27; recommendations unless specifically requested to do so by the relevant commission. On approval by the Privy Council, the new constituencies come into effect for the next general election. Any by-elections before then use the pre-existing boundaries.

These provisions were brought in by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020. Previously, Parliament voted on the recommendations and, although it could not make any alterations to them, it could reject them in their entirety. In addition, although this power was never exercised, for many years the legislation gave the Secretary of State the power to modify a commission&#x27;s recommendations. The new procedures further strengthen the separation of the creation of constituency boundaries from those elected for the resulting electoral areas, with the aim of eliminating any scope for gerrymandering.

==History==
=== Legislation ===
The commissions are currently established under the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, most recently amended by the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011. They were first established as permanent bodies under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944. The 1944 Act was amended in 1947 and then replaced by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. The 1949 Act was amended in 1958 and 1979 and replaced by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986; changes in legislation from 1944 to 1986 were generally incremental in nature.

The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 under PM Tony Blair&#x27;s government envisaged that the functions of the boundary commissioners would be transferred to the United Kingdom Electoral Commission, but this never transpired: the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 repealed the Act of Parliament (of 2000) effective from 1 April 2010.

The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 passed under the Con-Lib Dem coalition government made substantial changes to the legislation governing constituency boundary reviews; this was further amended by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020.

=== Past reviews of UK Parliament constituencies ===
Customarily, each commission conducted a complete review of all constituencies in its part of the United Kingdom every eight to twelve years. In between these general reviews, the commissions were able to conduct interim reviews of part of their area of responsibility. The interim reviews usually did not yield drastic changes in boundaries, while the general reviews generally did.

Under the rules in force before 2011, the number of constituencies in Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) had to &quot;not be substantially greater or less than 613&quot;, of which at least 35 had to be in Wales. The City of London was not to be partitioned and was to be included in a seat that referred to it by name. The Orkney and Shetland Islands were not to be combined with any other areas. Northern Ireland had to have between 16 and 18 constituencies.

Under the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, the terms of review were significantly different:
* the total number of constituencies was not fixed (&quot;see above&quot;): each commission had limited discretion to specify the number in its part of the United Kingdom;
* the size of the electorates was just one of several rules, rather than being subject to a numerical limit which overrides other factors;
* there was not previously a limit on the area of a constituency, but in practice, no constituency has ever exceeded the 13,000 square kilometre limit introduced by the 2011 Act; 
* the consultation mechanism was significantly different: consultation periods only lasted four weeks, and could be followed by local inquiries;
* reviews were only carried out every eight to twelve years instead of every five years.

The review that gave rise to most of the constituency boundaries currently in force is the Fifth Periodic Review, which was given effect in Wales by an Order made in 2006, in England by an Order from 2007 and in Northern Ireland by an Order from 2008, with the new boundaries used for the May 2010 general election. The most recent general review in Scotland was given effect in 2005, and the resulting constituencies were used in the May 2005 general election.

There are currently 533 constituencies in England, 40 constituencies in Wales, 59 constituencies in Scotland and 18 constituencies in Northern Ireland, providing a total of 650.

====Sixth Periodic Review====
The Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies was launched on 4 March 2011 by the Boundary Commission for England, the Boundary Commission for Scotland, the Boundary Commission for Wales and the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland. The Sixth Review would have resulted in 600 constituencies for the United Kingdom Parliament: a reduction from the 650 constituencies in existence at the 2010 general election. In January 2013, parliamentary opposition to proposed legislative amendments because of a lack of consensus in the coalition resulted in the review being suspended.

Following the Conservative victory at the 2015 general election, the review was recommenced in 2016 and final recommendations were submitted by the four commissions in September 2018 and laid before Parliament. However the revised proposals were never brought forward by the Government for approval and, further to the passing of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020, the Sixth Review was formally abandoned.

=== 2023 review ===
Following the passing of the 2020 Act, which reinstated the number of constituencies to 650, a new review, known as the 2023 Review, was launched by the four commissions on 5 January 2021. Under the new rules governing the number of constituencies in each nation, England would have 543 constituencies (+10), Wales 32 (-8), Scotland 57 (-2) and Northern Ireland 18 (unchanged).

The final consultation for England began on 8 November 2022 with the publication of the Revised Proposals and lasted for four weeks, ending on 5 December.

All four Commissions submitted their Final Recommendations Reports to the Speaker of the House of Commons on 27 June 2023. An order in council adopting the recommendations, &quot;The Parliamentary Constituencies Order 2023&quot; (No. 1230 of 2023), was made on 15 November 2023 and came into force on 29 November 2023.

==Relationship with local government, devolved parliaments and assemblies==
The scope of the boundary commissions&#x27; work is limited to areas for election to the UK House of Commons.

Local authority areas and electoral areas are reviewed by the separate:
* Local Government Boundary Commission for England
* Boundaries Scotland
* Local Government Boundaries Commissioner for Northern Ireland
* Democracy and Boundary Commission Cymru

Changes to parliamentary boundaries do not themselves impact on which local councils are responsible for any area.

===Scottish Parliament===
The procedure for reviews of constituencies and regions for the Scottish Parliament is set down by the Scotland Act 1998. That Act specifies that there are 73 constituencies for the Scottish Parliament: Na h-Eileanan an Iar, the Orkney Islands, the Shetland Islands and 70 others. The Act also specifies that the constituencies are grouped into eight regions to allow the return of list members elected by proportional representation to the parliament. The Boundary Commission for Scotland conducted a review of these boundaries between 2007 and 2010, and their recommendations were implemented from 2011. Since the legislation requires different numbers of constituencies in Scotland for the United Kingdom Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, these two sets of areas do not fit together neatly. Responsibility for Scottish Parliament boundary reviews passed to the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland in May 2017.

===Senedd===
The Government of Wales Act 2006 specified that the constituencies for the then National Assembly for Wales were to be the same as those for the UK Parliament at Westminster. The Act required the Boundary Commission for Wales to group the constituencies into electoral regions, to allow the return of list members elected by proportional representation to the Assembly. The Boundary Commission for Wales&#x27;s Fifth General Review resulted in revised Assembly constituencies and electoral regions. The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 removed the link with Westminster constituencies, and the Senedd Cymru (Members and Elections) Act 2024 made the Democracy and Boundary Commission Cymru the statutory review body for Senedd boundaries.

The Boundary Commission reported in 2016 proposing to reduce the number of UK Parliament constituencies in Wales to 29, on the basis that all constituencies must have at least 71,031 voters. While the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 removed the link between UK Parliament and Senedd seat boundaries, organisations such as the Electoral Reform Society have indicated a preference for coterminosity (meaning the mirroring of seat boundaries in Wales along the lines of the 2016 proposed reforms to the Welsh seats in the UK Parliament).

===Northern Ireland Assembly===
Section 33 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that the constituencies for the Northern Ireland Assembly are the same as the constituencies that are used for the United Kingdom Parliament. From 1998 to 2016 six members were elected from each constituency; the Assembly Members (Reduction of Numbers) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 reduced this to five members.

<text>Maus, often published as Maus: A Survivor&#x27;s Tale, is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, serialized from 1980 to 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs postmodern techniques, and represents Jews as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs respectively. Critics have classified &quot;Maus&quot; as memoir, biography, history, fiction, autobiography, or a mix of genres. In 1992, it became the first and only graphic novel to win a Pulitzer Prize.

In the frame-tale timeline in the narrative present that begins in 1978 in New York City, Spiegelman talks with his father Vladek about his Holocaust experiences, gathering material and information for the &quot;Maus&quot; project he is preparing. In the narrative past, Spiegelman depicts these experiences, from the years leading up to World War II to his parents&#x27; liberation from the Nazi concentration camps. Much of the story revolves around Spiegelman&#x27;s troubled relationship with his father and the absence of his mother, who died by suicide when Spiegelman was 20. Her grief-stricken husband destroyed her written accounts of Auschwitz. The book uses a minimalist drawing style and displays innovation in its pacing, structure, and page layouts.

A three-page strip also called &quot;Maus&quot; that he made in 1972 gave Spiegelman an opportunity to interview his father about his life during World War II. The recorded interviews became the basis for the book, which Spiegelman began in 1978. He serialized &quot;Maus&quot; from 1980 until 1991 as an insert in &quot;Raw&quot;, an avant-garde comics and graphics magazine published by Spiegelman and his wife, Françoise Mouly, who also appears in &quot;Maus&quot;. A collected volume of the first six chapters that appeared in 1986, Maus I: My Father Bleeds History, brought the book mainstream attention; a second volume, Maus II: And Here My Troubles Began, collected the remaining chapters in 1991. &quot;Maus&quot; was one of the first books in graphic novel format to receive significant academic attention in the English-speaking world.

==Synopsis==
Most of the book weaves in and out of two timelines. In the frame tale of the narrative present, Spiegelman interviews his father Vladek in the Rego Park neighborhood of Queens in New York City in 1978–79. The story Vladek tells unfolds in the narrative past, which begins in the mid-1930s, and continues until the end of the Holocaust in 1945.

In Rego Park in 1958, a young Art Spiegelman is skating with his friends when he falls down and hurts himself, but his friends keep going. When he returns home, he finds his father Vladek, who asks him why he is upset, and Art proceeds to tell him that his friends left him behind. His father responds in broken English, &quot;Friends? Your friends? If you lock them together in a room with no food for a week, then you could see what it is, friends!&quot;

As an adult, Art visits his father, from whom he has become estranged. Vladek has remarried a woman named Mala since the suicide of Art&#x27;s mother Anja in 1968. Art asks Vladek to recount his Holocaust experiences. Vladek tells of his time in the Polish city of Częstochowa and how he came to marry into Anja&#x27;s wealthy family in 1937 and move to Sosnowiec to become a manufacturer. Vladek begs Art not to include this in the book and Art reluctantly agrees. Anja suffers a breakdown due to postpartum depression after giving birth to their first son Richieu, and the couple go to a sanitarium in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia for her to recover. After they return, political and anti-Semitic tensions build until Vladek is drafted just before the Nazi invasion of Poland. Vladek is captured at the front and forced to work as a prisoner of war. After his release, he finds Germany has annexed Sosnowiec, and he is dropped off on the other side of the border in the German protectorate. He sneaks across the border and reunites with his family.

During one of Art&#x27;s visits, he finds that a friend of Mala&#x27;s has sent the couple one of the underground comix magazines Art contributed to. Mala had tried to hide it, but Vladek finds and reads it. In &quot;Prisoner on the Hell Planet&quot;, Art is traumatized by his mother&#x27;s suicide three months after his release from the mental hospital, and in the end depicts himself behind bars saying, &quot;You &quot;murdered&quot; me, Mommy, and left me here to take the rap!&quot; Though it brings back painful memories, Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best.

In 1943, the Nazis move the Jews of the Sosnowiec Ghetto to Srodula and march them back to Sosnowiec to work. The family splits up—Vladek and Anja send Richieu to Zawiercie to stay with an aunt for safety. As more Jews are sent from the ghettos to Auschwitz, the aunt poisons herself, her children and Richieu to death to escape the Gestapo and not die in the gas chamber. In Srodula, many Jews build bunkers to hide from the Germans. Vladek&#x27;s bunker is discovered and he is placed into a &quot;ghetto inside the ghetto&quot; surrounded by barbed wire. The remnants of Vladek and Anja&#x27;s family are taken away. Srodula is cleared of its Jews, except for a group Vladek hides with in another bunker. When the Germans depart, the group splits up and leaves the ghetto.

In Sosnowiec, Vladek and Anja move from one hiding place to the next, making occasional contact with other Jews in hiding. Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions. The couple arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary, but it is a trick—the Gestapo arrest them on the train (as Hungary is invaded) and take them to Auschwitz, where they are separated until after the war.

Art asks after Anja&#x27;s diaries, which Vladek tells him were her account of her Holocaust experiences and the only record of what happened to her after her separation from Vladek at Auschwitz and which Vladek says she had wanted Art to read. Vladek comes to admit that he burned them after she killed herself. Art is enraged and calls Vladek a &quot;murderer&quot;.

The story jumps to 1986, after the first six chapters of &quot;Maus&quot; have appeared in a collected edition. Art is overcome with the unexpected attention the book receives and finds himself &quot;totally blocked&quot;. Art talks about the book with his psychiatrist Paul Pavel, a Czech Holocaust survivor. Pavel suggests that, as those who perished in the camps can never tell their stories, &quot;maybe it&#x27;s better not to have any more stories&quot;. Art replies with a quote from Samuel Beckett: &quot;Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness&quot;, but then realizes, &quot;on the other hand, he &quot;said&quot; it&quot;.

Vladek tells of his hardship in the camps, of starvation and abuse, of his resourcefulness, of avoiding the —the process by which prisoners were selected for further labor or execution. Despite the danger, Anja and Vladek exchange occasional messages. As the war progresses and the German front is pushed back, the prisoners are marched from Auschwitz in occupied Poland to Gross-Rosen within the Reich and then to Dachau, where the hardships only increase and Vladek catches typhus.

The war ends, the camp survivors are freed and Vladek and Anja reunite. The book closes with Vladek turning over in his bed as he finishes his story and telling Art, &quot;I&#x27;m tired from talking, Richieu, and it&#x27;s enough stories for now&quot;. The final image is of Vladek and Anja&#x27;s tombstone—Vladek died in 1982, before the book was completed.

==Primary characters==










==Background==
Art Spiegelman was born on February 15, 1948, in Sweden to Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors Vladek and Anja Spiegelman. An aunt poisoned his parents&#x27; first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis, four years before Spiegelman&#x27;s birth. He and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1951. During his youth his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz, but his father did not want him to know about it.

Spiegelman developed an interest in comics early and began drawing professionally at 16. He spent a month in Binghamton State Mental Hospital in 1968 after a nervous breakdown. Shortly after he got out, his mother died by suicide. Spiegelman&#x27;s father was not happy with his son&#x27;s involvement in the hippie subculture. Spiegelman said that when he bought himself a German Volkswagen it damaged their already-strained relationship &quot;beyond repair&quot;. Around this time, Spiegelman read in fanzines about such graphic artists as Frans Masereel who had made wordless novels. The discussions in those fanzines about making the Great American Novel in comics inspired him.

Spiegelman became a key figure in the underground comix movement of the 1970s, both as cartoonist and editor. In 1972, Justin Green produced the semi-autobiographical comic book &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot;, which inspired other underground cartoonists to produce more personal and revealing work. The same year, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip for the first issue of &quot;Funny &quot;, which Green edited. Spiegelman wanted to do a strip about racism, and at first considered focusing on African Americans, with cats as Ku Klux Klan members chasing African-American mice. Instead, he turned to the Holocaust and depicted Nazi cats persecuting Jewish mice in a strip he titled &quot;Maus&quot;. The tale was narrated to a mouse named &quot;Mickey&quot;. After finishing the strip, Spiegelman visited his father to show him the finished work, which he had based in part on an anecdote he had heard about his father&#x27;s Auschwitz experience. His father gave him further background information, which piqued Spiegelman&#x27;s interest. Spiegelman recorded a series of interviews over four days with his father, which was to provide the basis of the longer &quot;Maus&quot;. Spiegelman followed up with extensive research, reading survivors&#x27; accounts and talking to friends and family who had also survived. He got detailed information about Sosnowiec from a series of Polish pamphlets published after the war which detailed what happened to the Jews by region.

In 1973, Spiegelman produced a strip for &quot;Short Order Comix&quot; #1 about his mother&#x27;s suicide called &quot;Prisoner on the Hell Planet&quot;. The same year, he edited a pornographic, psychedelic book of quotations, and dedicated it to his mother. He spent the rest of the 1970s building his reputation making short avant-garde comics. He moved back to New York from San Francisco in 1975, which he admitted to his father only in 1977, by which time he had decided to work on a &quot;very long comic book&quot;. He began another series of interviews with his father in 1978, and visited Auschwitz in 1979. He serialized the story in a comics and graphics magazine he and his wife Mouly began in 1980 called &quot;Raw&quot;.

===Comics medium===
American comic books were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s, but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s. By the time &quot;Maus&quot; began serialization, the &quot;Big Two&quot; comics publishers, Marvel and DC Comics, dominated the industry with mostly superhero titles. The underground comix movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund. The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies, inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression. Most discussion focused on comics as a genre rather than as a medium.

&quot;Maus&quot; came to prominence when the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; was beginning to gain currency. Will Eisner popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of &quot;A Contract with God&quot;. The term was used partly to rise above the low cultural status that comics had in the English-speaking world, and partly because the term &quot;comic book&quot; was being used to refer to short-form periodicals, leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book-form comics.

==Publication history==

The first chapter of &quot;Maus&quot; appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of &quot;Raw&quot; as a small insert; a new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991. Every chapter but the last appeared in &quot;Raw&quot;.

Spiegelman struggled to find a publisher for a book edition of &quot;Maus&quot;, but after a rave &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the serial in August 1986, Pantheon Books published the first six chapters in a volume called &quot;Maus: A Survivor&#x27;s Tale&quot; and subtitled &quot;My Father Bleeds History&quot;. Spiegelman was relieved that the book&#x27;s publication preceded the theatrical release of the animated film &quot;An American Tail&quot; by three months, as he believed that the film, produced by Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment, was inspired by &quot;Maus&quot; and wished to avoid comparisons with it.

The book found a large audience, partly because of its distribution through bookstores rather than the direct market comic shops where comic books were normally sold. &quot;Maus&quot; was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify, and also for booksellers, who needed to know on which shelves to place it. Though Pantheon pushed for the term &quot;graphic novel&quot;, Spiegelman was not comfortable with this, as many book-length comics were being referred to as &quot;graphic novels&quot; whether or not they had novelistic qualities. He suspected the term&#x27;s use was an attempt to validate the comics form, rather than to describe the content of the books. Spiegelman later came to accept the term, and with Drawn &amp; Quarterly publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the Book Industry Study Group in the early 2000s to include &quot;graphic novel&quot; as a category in bookstores.

Pantheon collected the last five chapters in 1991 in a second volume subtitled &quot;And Here My Troubles Began&quot;. Pantheon later collected the two volumes into soft- and hardcover two-volume boxed sets and single-volume editions. These boxed sets included an original comic by Spiegelman, entitled &quot;The Past Hangs Over the Future&quot;. In 1994 the Voyager Company released &quot;The Complete Maus&quot; on CD-ROM, a collection which contained the original comics, Vladek&#x27;s taped transcripts, filmed interviews, sketches, and other background material. The CD-ROM was based on HyperCard, a Macintosh and Apple IIGS application that has since become obsolete. In 2011 Pantheon Books published a companion to &quot;The Complete Maus&quot; entitled &quot;MetaMaus&quot;, with further background material, including filmed footage of Vladek. The centerpiece of the book is a Spiegelman interview conducted by Hillary Chute. It also has interviews with Spiegelman&#x27;s wife and children, sketches, photographs, family trees, assorted artwork, and a DVD with video, audio, photos, and an interactive version of &quot;Maus&quot;.

Spiegelman dedicated &quot;Maus&quot; to his brother Richieu and his first daughter Nadja. The epigraph of the first volume is a quote from Adolf Hitler: &quot;The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but they are not human&quot;. The opening of second volume emphasizes the dehumanization of the &quot;mouse&quot; metaphor, with a quote from a Nazi propaganda paper decrying Mickey Mouse, &quot;the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom&quot;, as evidence of the &quot;Jewish brutalization of the people&quot;.

===International publication===
Penguin Books obtained the rights to publish the initial volume in the Commonwealth in 1986. In support of the African National Congress&#x27;s cultural boycott in opposition to apartheid, Spiegelman refused to &quot;compromise with fascism&quot; by allowing publication of his work in South Africa.

By 2011, &quot;Maus&quot; had been translated into about 30 languages. Three translations were particularly important to Spiegelman: French, as his wife was French, and because of his respect for the sophisticated Franco-Belgian comics tradition; German, given the book&#x27;s background; and Polish. Poland was the setting for most of the book, and Polish was the language of his parents and his own mother tongue. The publishers of the German edition had to convince the German culture ministry of the work&#x27;s serious intent to have the swastika appear on the cover, per laws prohibiting the display of Nazi symbolism. Reception in Germany was positive—&quot;Maus&quot; was a best-seller and was taught in schools. The Polish translation encountered difficulties; as early as 1987, when Spiegelman planned a research visit to Poland, the Polish consulate official who approved his visa questioned him about the Poles&#x27; depiction as pigs, and pointed out how serious an insult it was. Publishers and commentators refused to deal with the book for fear of protests and boycotts. Piotr Bikont, a journalist for , set up his own publishing house to publish &quot;Maus&quot; in Polish in 2001. Demonstrators protested &quot;Maus&quot;″s publication and burned the book in front of &quot;Gazeta&quot;″s offices. Bikont&#x27;s response was to don a pig mask and wave to the protesters from the office windows. The magazine-sized Japanese translation was the only authorized edition with larger pages. Long-standing plans for an Arabic translation have yet to come to fruition. A Russian law passed in December 2014 prohibiting the display of Nazi propaganda led to the removal of &quot;Maus&quot; from Russian bookstores leading up to Victory Day due to the swastika appearing on the book&#x27;s cover. Now the book is widely available again, with a slightly modified cover.

A few panels were changed for the Hebrew edition of &quot;Maus&quot;. Based on Vladek&#x27;s memory, Spiegelman portrayed one of the minor characters as a member of the Nazi-installed Jewish Police. An Israeli descendant objected and threatened to sue for libel. Spiegelman redrew the character with a fedora in place of his original police hat, but appended a note to the volume voicing his objection to this &quot;intrusion&quot;. This version of the first volume appeared in 1990 from the publishing house Zmora Bitan. It had an indifferent or negative reception, and the publisher did not release the second volume. Another Israeli publisher put out both volumes, with a new translation by poet Yehuda Vizan that included Vladek&#x27;s broken language, which Zmora Bitan had refused to do. Marilyn Reizbaum saw this as highlighting a difference between the self-image of the Israeli Jew as a fearless defender of the homeland, and that of the American Jew as a feeble victim, something that one Israeli writer disparaged as &quot;the diaspora sickness&quot;.

==Themes==
===Presentation===
Spiegelman, like many of his critics, has expressed concern that &quot;[r]eality is too much for comics ... so much has to be left out or distorted&quot;, admitting that his presentation of the story may not be accurate. He takes a postmodern approach; &quot;Maus&quot; &quot;feeds on itself&quot;, telling the story of how the story was made. It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father&#x27;s memories, and the artistic choices he had to make. For example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman&#x27;s character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.

The book portrays humans with the heads and tails of different species of animals; Jews are drawn as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs, among others. Spiegelman took advantage of the way Nazi propaganda films depicted Jews as vermin, though he was first struck by the metaphor after attending a presentation where Ken Jacobs showed films of minstrel shows along with early American animated films, abundant with racial caricatures. Spiegelman derived the mouse as symbol for the Jew from Nazi propaganda, emphasized in a quote from a German newspaper in the 1930s that prefaces the second volume: &quot;Mickey Mouse is the most miserable idea ever revealed ... Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal ... Away with Jewish brutalization of the people! Down with Mickey Mouse! Wear the Swastika Cross!&quot;

Jewish characters try to pass themselves off as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back. Vladek&#x27;s disguise was more convincing than Anja&#x27;s—&quot;you could see she was more Jewish&quot;, Vladek says. Spiegelman shows this Jewishness by having her tail hang out of her disguise. This literalization of the genocidal stereotypes that drove the Nazis to their Final Solution, may risk reinforcing racist labels, but Spiegelman uses the idea to create anonymity for the characters. According to art historian Andrea Liss, this may paradoxically enable the reader to identify with the characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.

In making people of each ethnicity look alike, Spiegelman hoped to show the absurdity of dividing people along such lines. Spiegelman has stated that &quot;these metaphors ... are meant to self-destruct&quot; and &quot;reveal the inanity of the notion itself&quot;. Animals signified the characters&#x27; roles in the story rather than their races—the gentile Françoise is a mouse because of her identification with her husband, who identifies with the Holocaust victims, and her conversion to Judaism. When asked what animal he would make Israeli Jews, Spiegelman suggests porcupines. When Art visits his psychiatrist, the two wear mouse masks. Spiegelman&#x27;s perceptions of the animal metaphor seem to have evolved over the book&#x27;s making—in the original publication of the first volume, his self-portrait showed a mouse head on a human body, but by the time the second volume arrived, his self-portrait had become that of a man wearing a mouse mask. In &quot;Maus&quot;, the characters seem to be mice and cats only in their predator/prey relationship. In every respect other than their heads and tails, they act and speak as ordinary humans. Further complicating the animal metaphor, Anja is ironically shown to be afraid of mice, while other characters appear with pet dogs and cats, and the Nazis with attack dogs.

===Memory===
To Marianne Hirsch, Spiegelman&#x27;s life is &quot;dominated by memories that are not his own&quot;. His work is one not of memory but of &quot;postmemory&quot;, a term she coined after encountering &quot;Maus&quot;. This describes the relation of the children of survivors with the survivors themselves. While these children have not had their parents&#x27; experiences, they grow up with their parents&#x27; memories—the memory of another&#x27;s memory—until the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right. The children&#x27;s proximity creates a &quot;deep personal connection&quot; with the memory, though separated from it by &quot;generational distance&quot;. In the field of psychology, this is called transgenerational trauma or generational trauma.

Art tried to keep his father&#x27;s story chronological, because otherwise he would &quot;never keep it straight&quot;. His mother Anja&#x27;s memories are conspicuously absent from the narrative, given her suicide and Vladek&#x27;s destruction of her diaries. Hirsch sees &quot;Maus&quot; in part as an attempt to reconstruct her memory. Vladek keeps her memory alive with the pictures on his desk, &quot;like a shrine&quot;, according to Mala.

===Guilt===
Spiegelman displays his sense of guilt in many ways. He suffers anguish over his dead brother, Richieu, who perished in the Holocaust, and whom he feels he can never live up to. The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpses—the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom &quot;Maus&quot;″ success was built. He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son, and that some of Art&#x27;s guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way. As he had not lived in the camps himself, he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this &quot;separate universe&quot;, and feels inadequate in portraying it.

===Racism===
Spiegelman parodies the Nazis&#x27; vision of racial divisions; Vladek&#x27;s racism is also put on display when he becomes upset that Françoise would pick up a black hitchhiker, a &quot;schwartser&quot; as he says. When she berates him, a victim of antisemitism, for his attitude, he replies, &quot;It&#x27;s not even to compare, the schwartsers and the Jews!&quot; Spiegelman gradually deconstructs the animal metaphor throughout the book, especially in the second volume, showing where the lines cannot be drawn between races of humans.

The Germans are depicted with little difference between them, but there is great variety among the Poles and Jews who dominate the story. Sometimes Jews and the &quot;Judenrat&quot; councils are shown complying with the occupiers; some trick other Jews into capture, while others act as ghetto police for the Nazis.

Spiegelman shows numerous instances of Poles who risked themselves to aid Jews, and also shows antisemitism as being rife among them. The kapos who run the camps are Poles, and Anja and Vladek are tricked by Polish smugglers into the hands of the Nazis. Anja and Vladek hear stories that Poles continue to drive off and even kill returning Jews after the war.

===Language===
Vladek spoke Yiddish and Polish. He also learned English, German, and French while still in Poland. His knowledge of languages helps him several times during the story, both before and during his imprisonment. Vladek&#x27;s recounting of the Holocaust, first to American soldiers, then to his son, is in English, which became his daily language when he moved to America. Vladek&#x27;s English is fluent, but his phrasing is often non-native, showing the influence of Yiddish (and possibly also of Polish). For example, he asks Art, &quot;But, tell me, how is it by you? How is going the comics business?&quot; Later, describing his internment, he tells Art, &quot;[E]very day we prayed ... I was very religious, and it wasn&#x27;t else to do&quot;. The passages where he is shown in Europe speaking Yiddish or Polish are in standard English, without the idiosyncratic phrasings Spiegelman records from their English-language conversations. Spiegelman does not show other Holocaust survivors (Vladek&#x27;s second wife Mala, their friends, and Art&#x27;s therapist Paul Pavel) using Yiddish-influenced constructions.

The German word &quot;Maus&quot; is cognate to the English word &quot;mouse&quot;, and also reminiscent of the German verb , which means &quot;to speak like a Jew&quot; and refers to the way Jews from Eastern Europe spoke German—a word etymologically related not to &quot;Maus&quot; but, distantly, to &quot;Moses&quot;.

==Style==
Spiegelman&#x27;s perceived audacity in using the Holocaust as his subject was compounded by his telling the story in comics. The prevailing view in the English-speaking world held comics as inherently trivial, thus degrading Spiegelman&#x27;s subject matter, especially as he used animal heads in place of recognizably human ones. Talking animals have been a staple of comics, and while they have a traditional reputation as children&#x27;s fare, the underground had long made use of them in adult stories, for example in Robert Crumb&#x27;s Fritz the Cat, which comics critic Joseph Witek asserts shows that the genre could &quot;open up the way to a paradoxical narrative realism&quot; that &quot;Maus&quot; exploited.

Ostensibly about the Holocaust, the story entwines with the frame tale of Art interviewing and interacting with his father. Art&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner on the Hell Planet&quot; is also encompassed by the frame, and stands in visual and thematic contrast with the rest of the book as the characters are in human form in a surreal, German Expressionist woodcut style inspired by Lynd Ward.

Spiegelman blurs the line between the frame and the world, such as when neurotically trying to deal with what &quot;Maus&quot; is becoming for him, he says to his wife: &quot;In real life you&#x27;d never have let me talk this long without interrupting&quot;. When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse. Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father&#x27;s tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which &quot;helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities&quot;.

Spiegelman started taking down his interviews with Vladek on paper, but quickly switched to a tape recorder, face-to-face or over the phone. Spiegelman often condensed Vladek&#x27;s words, and occasionally added to the dialogue or synthesized multiple retellings into a single portrayal.

Spiegelman worried about the effect that his organizing of Vladek&#x27;s story would have on its authenticity. In the end, he eschewed a Joycean approach and settled on a linear narrative he thought would be better at &quot;getting things across&quot;. He strove to present how the book was recorded and organized as an integral part of the book itself, expressing the &quot;sense of an interview shaped by a relationship&quot;.

===Artwork===
The story is text-driven, with few wordless panels among its 1,500 black-and-white panels. The art has high contrast, with heavy black areas and thick black borders balanced against areas of white and wide white margins. There is little gray in the shading. In the narrative present, the pages are arranged in eight-panel grids; in the narrative past, Spiegelman found himself &quot;violating the grid constantly&quot; with his page layouts.

Spiegelman rendered the original three-page &quot;Maus&quot; and &quot;Prisoner on the Hell Planet&quot; in highly detailed, expressive styles. Spiegelman planned to draw &quot;Maus&quot; in such a manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies. Spiegelman wanted to get away from the rendering of the characters in the original &quot;Maus&quot;, in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, &quot;tells you how to feel, tells you how to think&quot;. He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments. He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions.

Spiegelman wanted the artwork to have a diary feel to it, and so drew the pages on stationery with a fountain pen and typewriter correction fluid. It was reproduced at the same size it was drawn, unlike his other work, which was usually drawn larger and shrunk down, which hides defects in the art.

===Influences===
Spiegelman has published articles promoting a greater knowledge of his medium&#x27;s history. Chief among his early influences were Harvey Kurtzman, Will Eisner, and Bernard Krigstein&#x27;s &quot;Master Race&quot;. Though he acknowledged Eisner&#x27;s early work as an influence, he denied that Eisner&#x27;s first graphic novel, &quot;A Contract with God&quot; (1978), had any impact on &quot;Maus&quot;. He cited Harold Gray&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; as having &quot;influenced &quot;Maus&quot; fairly directly&quot;, and praised Gray&#x27;s work for using a cartoon-based storytelling vocabulary, rather than an illustration-based one. Justin Green&#x27;s &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot; (1972) inspired Spiegelman to include autobiographical elements in his comics. Spiegelman stated, &quot;without &quot;Binky Brown&quot;, there would be no &quot;Maus&quot;&quot;. Among the graphic artists who influenced &quot;Maus&quot;, Spiegelman cited Frans Masereel, who had made early wordless novels in woodcuts such as &quot;Passionate Journey&quot; (1919).

==Reception and legacy==
Spiegelman&#x27;s work as cartoonist and editor had long been known and respected in the comics community, but the media attention after the first volume&#x27;s publication in 1986 was unexpected. Hundreds of overwhelmingly positive reviews appeared, and &quot;Maus&quot; became the center of new attention focused on comics. It was considered one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; book-form comics from around 1986–87, along with &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, that are said to have brought the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; and the idea of comics for adults into mainstream consciousness. It was credited with changing the public&#x27;s perception of what comics could be at a time when, in the English-speaking world, they were considered to be for children, and strongly associated with superheroes. Initially, critics of &quot;Maus&quot; showed a reluctance to include comics in literary discourse. &quot;The New York Times&quot; intended praise when saying of the book, &quot;Art Spiegelman doesn&#x27;t draw comic books&quot;. After its Pulitzer Prize win, it won greater acceptance and interest among academics. The Museum of Modern Art staged an exhibition on the making of &quot;Maus&quot; in 1991–92.

&quot;Maus&quot; proved difficult to classify to a genre, and has been called biography, fiction, autobiography, history, and memoir. Spiegelman petitioned &quot;The New York Times&quot; to move it from &quot;fiction&quot; to &quot;non-fiction&quot; on the newspaper&#x27;s bestseller list, saying, &quot;I shudder to think how David Duke ... would respond to seeing a carefully researched work based closely on my father&#x27;s memories of life in Hitler&#x27;s Europe and in the death camps classified as fiction&quot;. An editor responded, &quot;Let&#x27;s go out to Spiegelman&#x27;s house and if a giant mouse answers the door, we&#x27;ll move it to the nonfiction side of the list!&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; eventually acquiesced. The Pulitzer committee sidestepped the issue by giving the completed &quot;Maus&quot; a Special Award in Letters in 1992.

&quot;Maus&quot; ranked highly on comics and literature lists. &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; called it the fourth greatest comics work of the 20th century, and &quot;Wizard&quot; placed it first on their list of 100 Greatest Graphic Novels. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed &quot;Maus&quot; at seventh place on their list of &quot;The New Classics: Books – The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; put &quot;Maus&quot; at seventh place on their list of best non-fiction books from between 1923 and 2005, and fourth on their list of top graphic novels. Praise for the book also came from contemporaries such as Jules Feiffer and literary writers such as Umberto Eco. Spiegelman turned down numerous offers to have &quot;Maus&quot; adapted for film or television.

Early installments of &quot;Maus&quot; that appeared in &quot;Raw&quot; inspired the young Chris Ware to &quot;try to do comics that had a &#x27;serious&#x27; tone to them&quot;. &quot;Maus&quot; is cited as a primary influence on graphic novels such as Marjane Satrapi&#x27;s &quot;Persepolis&quot; and Alison Bechdel&#x27;s &quot;Fun Home&quot;.

In 2022, the board of trustees for McMinn County Schools in east Tennessee voted unanimously to remove &quot;Maus&quot; from the curriculum over concerns including profanity, violence, and nudity. The decision led to a backlash and attracted attention the day before Holocaust Remembrance Day, and was covered by media in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Spiegelman called the decision baffling, &quot;Orwellian&quot;, and &quot;daffily myopic&quot;. The ban led to Amazon sales of &quot;Maus&quot; rising to No. 1. On January 30, 2022, it was the No. 1 overall for books. On January 31, &quot;Maus&quot; held the No. 1 and No. 2 ranks on Amazon at different times during the day, and also appeared as a best seller on Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s top 100 list and Bookshop&#x27;s index of best-selling books. Student activist group Voters of Tomorrow then announced plans in February 2022 to distribute &quot;Maus&quot; and other challenged books to students in Texas and Virginia.

===Critique===
A cottage industry of academic research has built up around &quot;Maus;&quot; schools have also used it as course material in a range of fields, including literature, history, dysfunctional family psychology, language arts, and social studies. The volume of academic work published on &quot;Maus&quot; far surpasses that of any other work of comics. One of the earliest such works was Joshua Brown&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Of Mice and Memory&quot; from the &quot;Oral History Review&quot;, which deals with the problems Spiegelman faced in presenting his father&#x27;s story. Marianne Hirsch wrote an influential essay on post-memory entitled &quot;Family Pictures: &quot;Maus&quot;, Mourning, and Post-Memory&quot;, later expanded into a book called &quot;Family Frames: Photography, Narrative, and Postmemory&quot;. Academics far outside the field of comics such as Dominick LaCapra, Linda Hutcheon, and Terrence Des Pres took part in the discourse. Few approached &quot;Maus&quot; who were familiar with comics, largely because of the lack of an academic comics tradition—&quot;Maus&quot; tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective. In 2003, Deborah Geis edited a collection of essays on &quot;Maus&quot; called &quot;Considering &quot;Maus&quot;: Approaches to Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Survivor&#x27;s Tale&quot; of the Holocaust&quot;. &quot;Maus&quot; is considered an important work of Holocaust literature, and studies of it have made significant contributions to Holocaust studies.

According to writer Arie Kaplan, some Holocaust survivors objected to Spiegelman making a comic book out of their tragedy. Literary critics such as Hillel Halkin objected that the animal metaphor was &quot;doubly dehumanizing&quot;, reinforcing the Nazi belief that the atrocities were perpetrated by one species on another, when they were actually done by humans against humans. Comics writer and critic Harvey Pekar and others saw Spiegelman&#x27;s use of animals as potentially reinforcing stereotypes. Pekar was also disdainful of Spiegelman&#x27;s overwhelmingly negative portrayal of his father, calling him disingenuous and hypocritical for such a portrayal in a book that presents itself as objective. Comics critic R. C. Harvey argued that Spiegelman&#x27;s animal metaphor threatened &quot;to erode moral underpinnings&quot;, and played &quot;directly into racist vision&quot;.

Commentators such as Peter Obst and Lawrence Weschler expressed concern over the Poles&#x27; depiction as pigs, which reviewer Marek Kohn saw as an ethnic slur and &quot;The Norton Anthology of American Literature&quot; called &quot;a calculated insult&quot;. Jewish culture views pigs and pork as non-kosher, or &quot;unclean&quot;, a point of which the Jewish Spiegelman was unlikely to be ignorant. Critics such as Obst and Pekar have said that the portrayal of Poles is unbalanced—that, while some Poles are seen as helping Jews, they are often shown doing so for self-serving reasons. In the late 1990s, an objector to &quot;Maus&quot;″s depiction of Poles interrupted a presentation by Spiegelman at Montreal&#x27;s McGill University with persistent abuse and was removed from the auditorium.

Literary critic Walter Ben Michaels found Spiegelman&#x27;s racial divisions &quot;counterfactual&quot;. Spiegelman depicts Europeans as different animal species based on Nazi conceptions of race, but all Americans, both black and white, as dogs—with the exception of the Jews, who remain unassimilated mice. To Michaels, &quot;Maus&quot; seems to gloss over the racial inequality that has plagued the history of the U.S.

Scholar Bart Beaty disagrees with claims from other critics that &quot;Maus&quot; presents a fatalistic perspective. Rather, he argues that &quot;Maus&quot; problematizes the essentialistic understanding of the relationship between the German &quot;cats&quot; and Jewish &quot;mice&quot;, or the notion that there is something &quot;natural&quot; about Germans killing Jewish people.

Scholar Paul Buhle asserted: &quot;More than a few readers have described as the most compelling of any depiction, perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art is equal to the seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason&quot;. Michael Rothberg opined: &quot;By situating a nonfictional story in a highly mediated, unreal, &#x27;comic&#x27; space, Spiegelman captures the hyperintensity of Auschwitz&quot;.

=== Parody ===
Belgian publisher produced a book entitled &quot;Katz&quot;, a remix of Spiegelman&#x27;s book but with all animal heads replaced with cat heads. The book reproduced every page and line of dialogue from the French translation of &quot;Maus&quot;. The French publisher of the book, Flammarion, had the Belgian publisher destroy all copies under charges of copyright violation.

<text>Panzerkampfwagen&quot; VIII &quot;Maus (English: &#x27;mouse&#x27;) was a German World War II super-heavy tank completed in July of 1944. As of 2025, it is the heaviest fully enclosed armored fighting vehicle ever built. Five were ordered, but only two hulls and one turret were completed; the turret being attached before the testing grounds were captured by the Soviet military. 

These two prototypes underwent trials in late 1944. The complete vehicle was long, wide and high. Weighing about 188 metric tons, the Maus&#x27;s main armament was the Krupp-designed 128 mm KwK 44 L/55 gun, based on the 12.8 cm Pak 44 towed anti-tank gun also used in the casemate-type &quot;Jagdtiger&quot; tank destroyer, with a coaxial 75 mm KwK 44 L/36.5 gun. The 128 mm gun was powerful enough to destroy all Allied armored fighting vehicles in service at the time, with some at ranges exceeding .

The principal problem in the design of the &quot;Maus&quot; was developing an engine and drivetrain powerful enough to adequately propel the tank, yet small enough to fit inside it – as it was meant to use the same sort of &quot;hybrid drive&quot;, using an internal-combustion engine to operate an electric generator to power its tracks with electric motor units, much as its Porsche-designed predecessors, the VK 30.01 (P), VK 45.01 (P), and Elefant had. The drivetrain was electrical, designed to provide a maximum speed of and a minimum speed of . However, during actual field testing, the maximum speed achieved on hard surfaces was with full motor field, and by weakening the motor field to a minimum, a top speed of was achieved. The vehicle&#x27;s weight made it unable to use most bridges; instead it was intended to ford to a depth of or submerge up to a depth of and use a snorkel to cross rivers.

==Development==
The development of the Maus originates from a contract given to Porsche for the design of a 100-ton tank in March 1942. Porsche&#x27;s design, known as the &quot;VK 100.01&quot; / &quot;Porsche Type 205&quot;, was shown to Adolf Hitler in June 1942, who subsequently approved it. Work on the design began in earnest; the first prototype, to be ready in 1943 was initially to receive the name &quot;Mammut&quot; (&#x27;mammoth&#x27;). This was reportedly changed to &quot;Mäuschen&quot; (&#x27;little mouse&#x27;) in December 1942 and finally to &quot;Maus&quot; (&#x27;mouse&#x27;) in February 1943, which became the most common name for this tank.
The &quot;Maus&quot; was designed from the start to use the &quot;electric transmission&quot; design which Ferdinand Porsche had used in the VK 4501 (P), his unsuccessful attempt to win the production contract for the Tiger. The initial powerplant was the Daimler-Benz MB 509 gasoline engine, an adaptation of Germany&#x27;s largest displacement (at ) inverted V12 aircraft engine, the Daimler-Benz DB 603 petrol engine, and later changed to the Daimler-Benz MB 517 diesel engine. This drove an electrical generator, and their combined length occupied the central/rear two-thirds of the Maus&#x27; hull, cutting off the forward driver&#x27;s compartment in the hull from direct access to the turret from within the tank. Each 1.1-meter-wide track, which used the same basic &quot;contact shoe&quot; and &quot;connector link&quot; design format as the Henschel-built Tiger II, was driven by its own electric motor mounted within the upper rear area of each hull side. Each set of tracks had a suspension design containing a total of 24 road wheels per side, in six bogie sets, staggered to be spread over the entire width of the track.

Due to the return &quot;run&quot; of the uniquely 110 cm-wide tracks used being completely enclosed within the fixed outer side armor panels that defined its overall hull width, with the inner vertical lengthwise walls of the hull used to mount the suspension components, a narrow lengthwise &quot;tub&quot; remained between the hull&#x27;s inner armored walls, under and to the rear of the turret to house the engine and generator of the tank&#x27;s powertrain.

The armor was substantial: the hull front was thick, the sides and rear of the hull were up to . The turret armor was even thicker, the turret front was up to and the sides and rear . The gun mantlet was , and combined with the turret armor behind, the protection level at that section was even higher.

The initial plan for the &quot;Maus&quot; was for the prototype to have been completed by mid-1943, with monthly production scheduled to run at ten vehicles per month after delivery of the prototype. The work on the &quot;Maus&quot; would be divided between Krupp, responsible for the chassis, armament and turret and Alkett, who would be responsible for final assembly.
The &quot;Maus&quot; tank was originally designed to weigh approximately 100 tons and be armed with a 128 mm main gun and a 75 mm co-axial secondary gun. Additional armament options were studied including various versions of 128 mm, 150 mm, and 170 mm guns. In January 1943 Hitler himself insisted that the armament be a 128 mm main gun with a coaxial 75 mm gun. The 128 mm PaK 44 anti-tank field artillery piece of 1943 that Krupp adapted for arming the &quot;Maus&quot; as the &quot;Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 44&quot; retained, in parallel to the Porsche project, its original anti-tank &quot;Panzerabwehrkanone&quot; family designation of PaK 44 when mounted in the casemate-style Jagdtiger tank destroyer.

By May 1943, a wooden mockup of the final &quot;Maus&quot; configuration was ready and presented to Hitler, who approved it for mass production, ordering a first series of 150. At this point, the estimated weight of the &quot;Maus&quot; was 188 tons.

In his book &quot;Panzer Leader&quot;, Heinz Guderian wrote:
This lack of close combat armament was later addressed with the addition of a &quot;Nahverteidigungswaffe&quot; (short-range defensive ordnance) mounted in the turret roof, a MG 34 machine gun with 1,000 rounds mounted coaxially with the main weapons in the turret, and three pistol ports for submachine guns in the sides and rear of the turret. Future planned modifications included provisions for a MG 151/20 cannon for anti-aircraft defense mounted in the turret roof.

===V1===
The first, turretless prototype (V1) was assembled by Alkett in December 1943. Tests started the same month, with a mockup turret fitted of the same weight as the real turret. In June 1944 the production turret, with armament, was used for tests.

The &quot;Maus&quot; was too heavy to cross bridges. As a result, an alternative system was developed, where the &quot;Maus&quot; would instead ford the rivers it needed to cross. Due to its size, it could ford relatively deep streams, but for deeper ones it was to submerge and drive across the river bottom. The solution required tanks to be paired up. One &quot;Maus&quot; would supply electrical power to the crossing vehicle via a cable until it reached the other side. The crew would receive air through a large snorkel, which was long enough for the tank to go under water.

===V2===
In March 1944 the second prototype, the V2, was delivered. It differed in many details from the V1 prototype. In mid-1944, the V2 prototype was fitted with a powerplant and the first produced &quot;Maus&quot; turret. This turret was fitted with a 128 mm KwK 44 L/55 gun, a coaxial 75 mm KwK 44 L/36.5 gun and a coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34. The V1 prototype was supposed to be fitted with the second produced turret, but this never happened.

By July 1944, Krupp was in the process of producing four more &quot;Maus&quot; hulls, but they were ordered to halt production and scrap these. Krupp stopped all work on it in August 1944. Meanwhile, the V2 prototype started tests in September 1944, fitted with a Daimler-Benz MB 517 diesel engine, new electric steering system and a Skoda Works-designed running gear and tracks.

There was also a special railroad carriage made for transporting the &quot;Maus&quot; prototypes.

==Capture==
After the war, the commander of Soviet armored and mechanized troops ordered the hull of V1 to be mated with the turret of V2. The Soviets used six FAMO-built Sd.Kfz. 9 18t half-tracks, the largest of Germany&#x27;s half-track vehicles built until May 1945, to pull the 55-ton turret off the destroyed hull. The resulting vehicle was then sent back to the USSR for further testing and is now at Kubinka.

A gunsight intended for the wooden mock-up turret was captured by British forces. It is now in the collection of The Tank Museum at Bovington.

<text>Vincent C. Siew or Siew Wan-chang (; born 3 January 1939) is a Taiwanese politician who served as the Vice President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from 2008 to 2012. He was the first Taiwanese-born Premier of the Republic of China and former vice-chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT).

==Early life and education==
Born in Chiayi City in the then Japanese colony of Taiwan on 3 January 1939, Siew graduated from Chiayi High School in 1957. In 1961, he graduated from the Department of Diplomacy at National Chengchi University (NCCU). After completing his conscription, he passed the Foreign Affairs Special Examination of 1962. He subsequently received his master&#x27;s degree from the Graduate Institute of International Law and Diplomacy from NCCU in 1965. Although he was accepted by Harvard University, Siew chose to remain in Taiwan heeding his mother&#x27;s wishes. He completed a leadership seminar at Georgetown University in the United States in 1982 and was awarded Eisenhower Fellowships in 1985.

==Political career==
In April 1966, he was appointed as vice consul at the ROC Consulate-General in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and promoted as consul in 1969, a position he held until 1972. During his office term, he built close relationship between Taiwan and the governments and people of Malaysia and Singapore. He also successfully negotiated the establishment of the Trade Mission of the Republic of China in Singapore and its counterpart Singapore Trade Office in Taipei.

After the switch of China seat at the United Nations on 25 October 1971 from Republic of China (ROC) to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and amid massive changes within the international community, Siew determined to return to Taiwan. Once home, he became a section chief at the Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

He then joined the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the MOFA in 1972 which he rose from an inspector, department director until deputy director-general. He used to travel frequently between Taiwan and the United States (US) for bilateral trade agreement negotiation until the US switched diplomatic relations from ROC to PRC on 1 January 1979. In January 1982, he became the director-general of BOFT. During his office term, he worked towards simplifying laws and regulations, and also strengthening personnel management at the BOFT. To reduce the trade surplus between Taiwan and the US, he led trade missions to cover almost all US states as part of a campaign that drew considerable attention. He also participated in a number of additional trade missions to major trading nations to enhance economic and trade relations and resolve trade disputes. He vigorously promoted trade liberalization and globalization. He also authorized banks to process import-export permits, promoted professional training and introduced a rotating system for economic and trade representatives stationed outside Taiwan. His efforts helped build Taiwan&#x27;s very substantial foreign-exchange reserves and made Taiwan the world&#x27;s 13th largest trading nation.

As a member of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), he was named to the Central Committee of KMT in July 1988.

Siew was elected a member of the Legislative Yuan from 1996 to 1997. He was the KMT vice-presidential candidate in 2000 on the ticket of Lien Chan.

Siew is the former chairman of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (Siew submitted his resignation 24 June 2007 after his KMT vice-presidential nomination) and the incumbent Chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation. He resigned as KMT vice chairman and all other posts in the party before the legislative election in December 2004. He was criticised by the Pan-Blue Coalition for not taking a greater role in the Lien-Soong campaign and acting as convener for a private group of economic advisers for President Chen Shui-bian.

==Ministry of Economic Affairs==

With the appointment of new Premier on 1 June 1990, Siew was appointed as Minister of Economic Affairs. His appointment came at a time of problems with environment, stagnant investment and slow economic growth. Within six months, he managed to settle a five-year dispute with environmentalists that had been blocking Chinese Petroleum Corporation&#x27;s construction of a fifth naphtha cracker plant. He also settled a yen-year dispute between local government and a community over the construction of Changbin Industrial Park. Moreover, he succeeded in persuading Formosa Plastics Corp to invest in a major construction project, the sixth naphtha cracker plant in Yunlin County. He also overcame a legislative freeze of the budget of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant in Taipei County.

During his overall office term in the ministry, Siew promoted major investment programs, removed investment barriers, enhanced investment incentives and initiated the privatization of such state enterprises as China Steel, BES Engineering and China Petrochemical Development. He also eased government controls on cross-strait trade and investments. He led a delegation to Europe, Central America and South America to explore opportunities for international economic and trade cooperation which also contributed to the promotion of trade diplomacy.

===1991 and 1992 APEC===
In November 1991, Siew represented ROC, under the name Chinese Taipei, for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) held in Seoul, South Korea. In November 1992, he again represented Chinese Taipei for APEC in Bangkok, Thailand. After a series of negotiations, he managed to secure ROC, under the name Chinese Taipei, as an observer member.

==Council for Economic Planning and Development==

===CEPD Vice Chairmanship===
In 1988-1989, he was appointed as the Vice Chairman of Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) in which during his office term, he promoted major infrastructure projects, such as the straightening of Keelung River, the placement of Taipei City rail lines underground, the construction of the East-West Highway, the diversion of Chichi River and the expansion of Kaohsiung International Airport.

===CEPD Chairmanship===
In February 1993, Siew was appointed as the Chairman of CEPD. In June 1993, he announced his economic stimulus package aiming at promoting steady economic growth, as Taiwan&#x27;s economy was at that time experiencing stagnant export growth and production levels. In August 1993, he completed a review of the Six-Year National Development Plan of the ROC and assigned priorities to projects on the basis of availability of resources and the maintenance of financial stability. In July 1994, he undertook major administrative reform with the introduction of a program to streamline bidding procedures for public construction projects and government procurement. He also initiated a program to develop Taiwan into an operation center for the Asia-Pacific region.

===1993 and 1994 APEC===
As the chairman, he represented President Lee Teng-hui, who was forbidden to attend personally, at the 1993 and 1994 annual APEC leaders&#x27; summits held in November 1993 and November 1994 at Seattle, United States and Bogor, Indonesia respectively. At both meetings, he presented papers on Taiwan&#x27;s successful experience in the development of agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprises. The action plans proposed in the papers won the approval of APEC support and helped promote Taiwan in the international trade and investment arenas.

==Mainland Affairs Council==

On 15 December 1994, Siew was appointed to become the Minister of Mainland Affairs Council replacing Huang Kun-huei. During his office term, he proposed a fresh series of measures and actions to relax restrictions on trade with and investment in Mainland China to encourage the development of Cross-Strait relations through trade and investment activities.

==ROC premiership==

===Premiership appointment===
Siew was appointed as the Premier by President Lee Teng-hui after the 15th National Congress of Kuomintang held in August 1997 in Taipei. Siew took office on 1 September 1997.

===Taiwan&#x27;s nuclear waste storage in Mainland China===
Premier Siew instructed Taiwan Power Company to sign the unpublished agreement with Mainland China regarding Taiwan&#x27;s nuclear waste storage in Gansu province. A memorandum of it was signed during his term as Premier, although it was later suspended after the transfer of power in 2000 to Premier Tang Fei.

===2000 presidential election===
On 18 March 2000, Siew joined the 2000 presidential election as a candidate for vice president with his running mate Lien Chan. However, Siew and Lien lost the election to Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu of the Democratic Progressive Party.

==ROC vice presidency==

===2008 ROC vice presidential election===

In May 2007, Siew was mentioned as a possible running mate for KMT presidential nominee Ma Ying-Jeou. This speculation came to fruition after Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng declined Ma&#x27;s offer to be his running mate. On 23 June 2007, ending weeks of speculation, Ma formally introduced Siew to be his vice-presidential running mate. The 2008 run is Siew&#x27;s second ticket, having been selected also as the vice-presidential candidate of Lien Chan&#x27;s KMT ticket in 2000.

On March 22, Ma and Siew won the 2008 presidential elections. He and Ma won with 7,659,014 (58.45%) votes against Hsieh and Su&#x27;s 5,444,949 (41.55%) votes.

===2008 Boao Forum for Asia===
On 11 April 2008, Vincent Siew departed Taiwan to attend the Boao Forum for Asia, held in Boao, Hainan, which is administered by mainland China. Siew is a founding delegate of the forum from 2001, and he attended once again in his capacity as chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation. Siew had met with Chinese Communist Party general secretary Hu Jintao in Bo&#x27;ao in 2001. However, his special status as the vice president-elect in 2008 made his attendance more significant, but also more controversial in Taiwan. His meeting with Hu Jintao was the highest level exchange between Taiwan and mainland China since the 2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China. The level of reception for Siew in Hainan was scaled accordingly and was equivalent to that reserved for Lien Chan in 2005.

On 12 April 2008, Vincent Siew met with Hu Jintao at the Boao Asia Forum as part of the Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation delegation, which also included other former and future government officials and business leaders from Taiwan. At the meeting, Siew and Hu exchanged their optimism for cross-strait relations under the new Taiwanese leadership of Ma Ying-jeou and Vincent Siew. Hu asked Siew to convey his greetings to Ma Ying-jeou, Kuomintang chairman Wu Po-hsiung and chairman emeritus Lien Chan. Siew raised the issue of regular cross-strait flights and the resumption of regular talks between the two governments, propositions to which Hu expressed agreement.

===Vice presidency sworn-in===
Siew, along with Ma, was sworn in on 20 May 2008 in Taipei to be Vice President and President of the Republic of China respectively.

===First overseas trip as vice president===
On 4 September 2008, Siew embarked on his first overseas trip as vice president, visiting Swaziland for four days. Siew&#x27;s trip aimed to cement further the diplomatic ties between the two countries, and to celebrate King Mswati III&#x27;s fortieth birthday. Foreign Minister Francisco Ou accompanied Siew on the trip.

===2012 vice presidency election===
Siew declined to run for a second term in Ma&#x27;s 2012 re-election bid. Ma, instead, nominated Premier Wu Den-yih for the vice presidential slot on the ticket.

==Post political career==

===2014 Boao Forum for Asia===
Siew, in his capacity as the honorary chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation, attended the Boao Forum for Asia held in April 2014 in Hainan where he met with Premier Li Keqiang. He reiterated the intention of Taiwan to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. He also told Li that Taiwan and Mainland China should push for greater bilateral trade liberalization to build a comprehensive economic relationship and express Taiwan&#x27;s wish to join the regional economy.

===2014 APEC China===
In November 2014 in his capacity of the Economic Leader of Chinese Taipei, Siew flew to Beijing to attend the APEC China 2014 where he met with Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People. Both leaders agreed that there should be no changes in the 1992 Consensus and two other principles in pushing forward with the development of cross-Strait relations. Xi said that although relations of both sides have seen some progress over the past few years, there had been also some new problems. He added that the two sides should try to maintain the long-term and healthy development of relation by improving the confidence, mutual trust, respect and interaction. Part of Siew delegation included Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi and several Taiwanese business people.

<doc id="349136" wikidata="Q92875" url="?curid=349136" title="Gordon Bell">
<text>Chester Gordon Bell (August 19, 1934 – May 17, 2024) was an American electrical engineer and manager. An early employee of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), from 1960–1966, Bell designed several of their PDP machines and later served as the company&#x27;s Vice President of Engineering from 1972–1983, overseeing development of the VAX computer systems. Bell&#x27;s later career included roles as an entrepreneur, investor, founding Assistant Director of NSF&#x27;s Computing and Information Science and Engineering Directorate from 1986–1987, and researcher emeritus at Microsoft Research from 1995–2015.

==Early life and education==
Gordon Bell was born in Kirksville, Missouri. He grew up helping with the family business, Bell Electric, repairing appliances and wiring homes.

Bell received a BS (1956), and MS (1957) in electrical engineering from MIT. He then went to the New South Wales University of Technology (now UNSW) in Australia on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1957–58, where he taught classes on computer design, programmed one of the first computers to arrive in Australia (called UTECOM, an English Electric DEUCE), and published his first academic paper. Returning to the US, he worked in the MIT Speech Computation Laboratory under Professor Ken Stevens, where he wrote the first analysis by synthesis program.

==Career==

===Digital Equipment Corporation===
The DEC founders Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson recruited him for their new company in 1960, where he designed the I/O subsystem of the PDP-1, including the first UART. Bell was the architect of the PDP-4, and PDP-6. Other architectural contributions were to the PDP-5 and PDP-11 Unibus and General Registers architecture.

After DEC, Bell went to Carnegie Mellon University in 1966 to teach computer science. He returned to DEC in 1972 as vice-president of engineering, where he was in charge of the successful VAX computer.

===Entrepreneur and policy advisor===
Bell reportedly later came to find work at DEC stressful, and suffered a heart attack in March 1983. After he recovered and shortly after he returned to work, he resigned from the company in the summer. Afterwards, he founded Encore Computer, one of the first shared memory, multiple-microprocessor computers to use the snooping cache structure.

During the 1980s he became involved with public policy, becoming the first and founding Assistant Director of the CISE Directorate of the NSF, and led the cross-agency group that specified the NREN.

Bell also established the ACM Gordon Bell Prize (administered by the ACM and IEEE) in 1987 to encourage development in parallel processing. The first Gordon Bell Prize was won by researchers at the Parallel Processing Division of Sandia National Laboratory for work done on the 1000-processor nCUBE 10 hypercube.

He was a founding member of Ardent Computer in 1986, becoming VP of R&amp;D in 1988, and remained until it merged with Stellar in 1989, to become Stardent Computer.

===Microsoft Research===
Between 1991 and 1995, Bell advised Microsoft in its efforts to start a research group, then joined it full-time in August 1995, studying telepresence and related ideas. He was the experiment subject for the MyLifeBits project, an experiment in life-logging (not the same as life-blogging). This was an attempt to fulfill Vannevar Bush&#x27;s vision of an automated store of the documents, pictures (including those taken automatically), and sounds an individual has experienced in his lifetime, to be accessed with speed and ease. For this, Bell digitized all documents he has read or produced, CDs, emails, and so on.

== Death ==
Bell died of aspiration pneumonia at his home in Coronado, California, on May 17, 2024. He was 89.

==Bell&#x27;s law of computer classes==
Bell&#x27;s law of computer classes was first described in 1972 with the emergence of a new, lower priced microcomputer class based on the microprocessor. Established market class computers are introduced at a constant price with increasing functionality and performance. Technology advances in semiconductors, storage, interfaces and networks enable a new computer class (platform) to form about every decade to serve a new need. Each new &quot;usually lower priced&quot; class is maintained as a quasi independent industry (market). Classes include: mainframes (1960s), minicomputers (1970s), networked workstations and personal computers (1980s), browser-web-server structure (1990s), palmtop computing (1995), web services (2000s), convergence of cell phones and computers (2003), and Wireless Sensor Networks aka motes (2004). Bell predicted that home and body area networks would form by 2010.

==Legacy and honors==
Bell has been described as &quot;a giant in the computer industry&quot;, &quot;an architect of our digital age&quot;, and &quot;father of the minicomputer&quot;.

Bell was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1977 for contributions to the architecture of minicomputers. He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1994), American Association for the Advancement of Science (1983), Association for Computing Machinery (1994), IEEE (1974), and member of the National Academy of Sciences (2007), and Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (2009).

He is also a member of the advisory board of TTI/Vanguard and a former member of the Sector Advisory Committee of Australia&#x27;s Information and Communication Technology Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.

Bell was the first recipient of the IEEE John von Neumann Medal, in 1992. His other awards include Fellow of the Computer History Museum, the AeA Inventor Award, the Vladimir Karapetoff Outstanding Technical Achievement Award of Eta Kappa Nu, and the 1991 National Medal of Technology by President George H. W. Bush. He was also named an Eta Kappa Nu Eminent Member in 2007.
In 1993, Worcester Polytechnic Institute awarded Bell an Honorary Doctor of Engineering, and in 2010, Bell received an honorary Doctor of Science and Technology degree from Carnegie Mellon University. The latter award referred to him as &quot;the father of the minicomputer&quot;.

Bell co-founded The Computer Museum in Boston, Massachusetts, with his wife Gwen Bell in 1979. He was a founding board member of its successor, the Computer History Museum located in Mountain View, California. In 2003, he was made a Fellow of the Museum &quot;for his key role in the minicomputer revolution, and for contributions as a computer architect and entrepreneur&quot;. The story of the museum&#x27;s evolution beginning in the early 1970s with Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation is described in the Microsoft Technical Report MSR-TR-2011-44, &quot;Out of a Closet: The Early Years of The Computer [x]* Museum&quot;. A timeline of computing historical machines, events, and people is given on his website. It covers from prehistoric times to the present.

<text>Fotini G. Markopoulou-Kalamara (; born April 3, 1971) is a Greek theoretical physicist and design engineer. She has worked in quantum gravity, quantum mechanics and quantum cosmology, technological evolution in complex systems, embodied cognition technologies, and the design of organizations that foster innovation and science research. Markopoulou is principal at ComplexReal, an interdisciplinary collective tracking sensitive intervention points (SIPs) in the interface between science, technology and culture. She was a founding faculty member at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and co-founder and CEO of Empathic Technologies.

==Background==
Markopoulou was born in Athens to sculptors Dimitris Kalamaras and Maria Vassilatou. She received her PhD from Imperial College London (1998). Markopoulou held postdoctoral positions at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, Imperial College London, and the Pennsylvania State University and was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Santa Fe Institute for Complex Systems. She shared First Prize in the Ultimate Reality Symposium in honor of J.A. Wheeler at Princeton, New Jersey and received the Alexander von Humboldt Award for Experienced Researchers (2010).

In 2014, Markopoulou received a Double Masters in Innovation Design Engineering (IDE) from the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London (2014), an interdisciplinary program focused on impactful innovation through critical observation, design thinking, emergent technologies and enterprise activities. Her Masters group project won the Deutsche Bank Award for Creative Enterprise (Design Category) 2014 and was exhibited at the John Lewis Future Store.

==Quantum Gravity==
In her interdisciplinary paper &quot;The Internal Description of a Causal Set: What the Universe Looks Like from the Inside&quot;, Markopoulou instantiates some abstract terms from mathematical category theory to develop straightforward models of space-time. It proposes simple quantum models of space-time based on category-theoretic notions of a topos and its subobject classifier (which has a Heyting algebra structure, but not necessarily a Boolean algebra structure). For example, hard-to-picture category-theoretic &quot;presheaves&quot; from topos theory become easy-to-picture &quot;evolving (or varying) sets&quot; in her discussions of quantum spacetime.

In 2008, Markopoulou, Tomasz Konopka, Mohammad H. Ansari, and Simone Severini initiated the study of a new background independent model of evolutionary space called quantum graphity. As described in George Musser&#x27;s book, &quot;Spooky Action at a Distance&quot;, in the quantum graphity model, points in spacetime are represented by nodes on a graph connected by links that can be on or off. This indicates whether or not the two points are directly connected as if they are next to each other in spacetime. When they are on the links have additional state variables which are used to define the random dynamics of the graph under the influence of quantum fluctuations and temperature. At high temperature the graph is in Phase I where all the points are connected to each other and no concept of spacetime as we know it exists. As the universe cools, the model undergoes a phase transition to Phase II where spacetime emerges as low connectivity and geometrical symmetries in the model graph. The hypothesis of quantum graphity is that this geometrogenesis models the condensation of spacetime in the big bang. A second model, related to ideas around quantum graphity, has been published.

Markopoulou is one of the quantum gravity researchers that uses the quantum computation framework to formulate new quantum theories of gravity. In her paper &quot;The Computing Spacetime&quot; she has given an easily accessible overview of these ideas.

== Perimeter Institute ==
In 1999, Dr. Markopoulou was invited, along with Rob Myers and Lee Smolin, to found the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada.  With an initial donation of $100 million from Mike Lazaridis (founder of Blackberry), the Perimeter Institute is one of the “world’s foremost centers for research, graduate training, and educational outreach in theoretical physics, uniting public and private partners, and the world’s best scientific minds, in a shared enterprise to achieve breakthroughs that will transform our future.” Markopoulou left Perimeter in 2011, after Perimeter’s new director Neil Turok decided to change the Institute’s focus and strategy.

==Empathic Technologies==
From 2014 to 2022, Dr. Markopoulou was co-founder and CEO at Empathic Technologies, employing cutting-edge discoveries in embodied cognition to create technologies that change how people perceive, feel, and behave. Empathic’s wearable product, doppel, is a wristband that reduces stress. Peer-reviewed trial results found that Doppel had a significant calming effect during a socially stressful situation. She received a U.S. Patent for this invention in 2016, and won the Best Female-Led Investment 2018 Award from the UK Business Angels Association.

==Evolution of Technologies==

With Eric Beinhocker, Doyne Farmer and Steen Rasmussen, Markopoulou participated in the Working Group on The Growing Gap between Social and Physical Technologies. In complex systems, physical technologies are ways to organize matter, energy or information, while social technologies are ways to organize people and their behavior (for example institutions, laws, norms and narratives). Several times throughout history, situations have emerged when our physical technology has outpaced our social technology. She co-organized two workshops at SFI to bring together engineers, scientists, writers, historians, lawyers, futurists, economists, philosophers, founders, philanthropists, and policymakers, to identify tracking indicators for such transitions and create roadmaps of scenarios and options. An account of the outcomes was published in the 2020 Aeon article &quot;Collaborators in Creation&quot;. The two workshops were filmed and formed the basis of the award-winning documentary &quot;Solutions&quot; by Pernille Rose Grønkjær.

Prompted by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health, Markopoulou expanded the focus of Empathic and led an interdisciplinary research team on an intensive year-long project on the future of emotions and emotion technologies.

<text>The Gulf of Sidra (, also known as the Gulf of Sirte (), is a body of water in the Mediterranean Sea on the northern coast of Libya, named after the oil port of Sidra or the city of Sirte. It was also historically known as the Great Sirte or Greater Syrtis (; ; contrasting with Syrtis Minor on the coast of Tunisia).

== Geography ==
The Gulf of Sidra or Sirte has been a major center for tuna fishing in the Mediterranean for centuries. It gives its name to the city of Sirte situated on its western coast.

The gulf measures from the promontory of Boreum (now Ras Teyonas) on the east side to the promontory of Cephalae (Ras Kasr Hamet) on the west. The greatest extension of the gulf inland is land inward and it occupies an area of 57,000 square kilometres.

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===
In ancient literature, the Syrtes (the Greater, or , in the eastern and the Lesser, or , in the western part of the Gulf) were notorious sandbanks, which sailors always took pains to avoid. The local climate features frequent calms and a relatively powerful north wind. The shoreline between Cyrene in the east and Carthage in the west featured few ports.

Ancient writers frequently mention the sandbanks and their vicinity as dangerous for shipping. The Syrtes maiores are unusually tidal and feature a strong (3 knots) clockwise current, at the rising tide, which then switches when the tide ebbs. That feature may explain the curious corkscrew shape in the area on the Peutinger Table. The landward side was a featureless plain which contrasted with the fertility of the rest of Tripolitania, to the west.

Ancient writers mention sandstorms and serpents in this area. Strabo describes a march by the Roman general, Cato the Younger in 47 BC which took thirty days &quot;through deep and scorching sand&quot;. Strabo also gives a full account of the dangers for shipping: &quot;the difficulty with both the Greater and the Lesser Syrtes is that in many places the water is shallow, and at the rise and fall of the tides ships sometimes fall into the shallows and settle there, and it is rare for them to be saved&quot; (17.3.20). Pomponius Mela gives a very melodramatic description:
&quot;The Syrtes [Minores] ... have no ports and are alarming because of the frequent shallows and even more dangerous because of the reversing movements of the sea as it flows in and out ... then [there is] a second Syrtes, equal in name and nature to the first, but about twice the size&quot; (1.35–37).

These sources should not however be taken at face value: Mela goes on to say that there were no ports in the Greater Syrtes either, but his reliability on this point – and therefore presumably others – is highly questionable: Pseudo-Scylax, writing in the early 4th century BC, records a port in the larger gulf (109), and Strabo places a &quot;very large emporium&quot; in the smaller one before Mela&#x27;s time (17.3.17). Furthermore, the ancient textual evidence is not unambiguous in its condemnation of the Syrtes. Plutarch gives a much less melodramatic account of Cato&#x27;s march than Strabo&#x27;s, saying (admittedly implausibly) that it took only seven days, and that locals were engaged to protect his troops from serpents (Cato Minor 56; see also the uneventful late 5th-century journey along the coast from Euesperides to Neapolis reported at Thucydides 7.50.2). And while Strabo pointed out the dangers of the sandbanks, he continues: &quot;On this account sailors travel along the coast at a distance, taking care lest they are caught off their guard and driven into these gulfs by winds.&quot; As in Cato, they do not avoid the area, but merely take precautions against its relative dangers. Similarly, Pliny&#x27;s warning that the gulf was &quot;formidable because of the shallow and tidal water of the two Syrtes&quot; at &quot;Natural History&quot; 5.26 should be seen in the context of his broader claim in that work that all the coastlines of the Mediterranean were welcoming (&quot;NH&quot; 2.118).

Their infamous reputation is, however, found in Roman poetry, for example Catullus (Carmen LXIV, 156) and Virgil (Aeneid IV, 41) on.

The information in this section is largely taken from &quot;The Syrtes between East and West&quot; by Josephine Crawley Quinn.

=== World War II ===
Two naval battles were fought in the Gulf of Sidra in World War II:
* First Battle of Sirte, between Regia Marina and the Royal Navy in December 1941.
* Second Battle of Sirte, between Regia Marina and the Royal Navy in March 1942.

=== Cold War ===
After the coup d&#x27;état which brought Muammar Gaddafi to power in 1969, there were a number of international incidents concerning territorial claims of the Gaddafi regime over the waters of the Gulf of Sidra. The gulf was generally referred to by the US military in those times as &quot;Gulf of Sidra&quot;, after the increasingly important oil port of Sidra on its shores.

====1973====
In 1973, Gaddafi claimed much of the Gulf of Sidra to be within Libyan internal waters by drawing a straight line at 32 degrees, 30 minutes north between a point near Benghazi and the western headland of the gulf at Misrata with an exclusive fishing zone.
Gaddafi declared it the Line of Death, the crossing of which would invite a military response. The US claimed its rights to conduct naval operations in international waters, using the modern international standard of territorial limit from a country&#x27;s shore as defined by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Gaddafi claimed it to be a territorial sea, not just a coastal area. In response the United States authorized Naval exercises in the Gulf of Sidra to conduct freedom of navigation (FON) operations.

On 21 March 1973, Libyan fighter planes intercepted and fired on a U.S. Air Force C-130 conducting signals intelligence off the Libyan coast. During the encounter, two Libyan Mirage fighters signaled the C-130 to follow them toward Libya and land, prompting the American plane to take evasive action. The C-130 received cannon fire from the Libyan fighters as it fled, but was able to escape by using cloud cover. According to US officials, the American plane was never closer than 120 kilometres to the Libyan coast.

====1980====
While operating over the Mediterranean Sea on 16 September 1980, a US Boeing RC-135V/W reconnaissance plane was fired on by a Libyan fighter. The RC-135 was not hit and the United States took no retaliatory action after the incident.

====1981====
In August 1981, during the United States Sixth Fleet Freedom of Navigation exercises, Libyan fighter planes were assembled from elsewhere in the country to fly patrols near the American ships. On 19 August, two Libyan Su-22 Fitter fighter-bombers were intercepted by two F-14 Tomcat fighters from the aircraft carrier . During the engagement, one of the American planes was targeted by an air-to-air Atoll missile. After evading the missile, the Tomcats shot down both Libyan planes with Sidewinder missiles. According to some reports, the two Libyan pilots managed to eject and were rescued from the sea. According to other reports, the parachute of one of the Libyan pilots failed to open.

====1986====

In the spring of 1986, the U.S. Navy deployed three aircraft carrier task force groups, USS &quot;America&quot;, USS &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; from the Sixth Fleet with 225 aircraft and some 30 warships across the &quot;Line of Death&quot; and into the disputed Gulf of Sidra. After a day of armed conflict, the operation was terminated after an unknown number of human and materiel losses to the Libyan side and no losses to the American side.

Two weeks later on 5 April 1986, a bomb exploded in a West Berlin disco, La Belle, killing two American servicemen, a Turkish woman and wounding 200 others. The United States claimed to have obtained cable transcripts from Libyan agents in East Germany involved in the attack. After several days of diplomatic talks with European and Arab partners, President Ronald Reagan ordered eighteen F-111F strike aircraft of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying from RAF Lakenheath supported by four EF-111A Ravens of the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing, from RAF Upper Heyford in England to strike targets in Libya in conjunction with fifteen A-6, A-7, F/A-18 attack aircraft and EA-6B Prowler Electronic Warfare Aircraft from the aircraft carriers USS &quot;Saratoga&quot;, USS &quot;America&quot; and USS &quot;Coral Sea&quot; on station in the Gulf of Sidra. The planes flying from Britain had to fly over the Atlantic, down the coast of Spain, and then turn east into the Mediterranean because the French and Spanish governments refused permission to use their airspace for the attack. This necessitated use of mid-air refueling. The attack lasted about ten minutes, hitting several targets early on 15 April. Two American airmen were killed when their plane was shot down over the Gulf of Sidra. Forty-five Libyan soldiers and government officials and fifteen civilians were also killed.

====1989====

In 1989, in another Gulf of Sidra incident, two Libyan MiG-23 Flogger aircraft were shot down when it was believed they were about to attack the U.S. fighters that were in the area. In this instance, the Flogger pilots were reportedly lost when they were fired on and successfully shot down after a series of missile launches, although they were seen to eject and parachute into the sea.

<doc id="349148" wikidata="Q2472283" url="?curid=349148" title="Boys Beware">
<text>Boys Beware is a 1961 short social guidance film released through Sid Davis Productions. It portrays and attempts to educate about an alleged danger to young boys from predatory homosexuals. The film was released under the copyright laws in the United States at the time of its release, but has lapsed into the public domain and is available from the Prelinger Archives.

With a budget of $1,000 (), the film was shot partially in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood, California, and produced with the cooperation of the city&#x27;s police department and the Inglewood Unified School District. &quot;Boys Beware&quot; was narrated by a police detective on his way to a school meeting to discuss the issue of sexual predators who attempt to lure adolescent males.

The film equates homosexuals with child molesters and hebephiles, repeatedly describing homosexuality as a mental illness. True to the stereotypes of its time, the gay men in the film have mustaches, sunglasses and/or bow ties.

Davis was friendly with the police in Southern California and would accept their suggestions of topics to make films about, allowing them to guide the films&#x27; message and development.

==Plot==
Teenage Jimmy Barnes was supposedly playing baseball and did not feel like walking home, so he decided to &quot;thumb&quot; a ride. A few moments later, a car pulls up and Jimmy enters the car of a stranger named Ralph. Jimmy and Ralph start a conversation while on the way to Jimmy&#x27;s house. They arrive at his house and Jimmy gets out of Ralph&#x27;s car. The following day, Ralph appears in his car waiting for him. Jimmy noticed that it was the same car and decided to ride once again. Instead of going straight to Jimmy&#x27;s house, they go to a drive-in and the stranger bought him a Coke. Jimmy and Ralph hang out near a pond with ducks; both are later seen fishing on a dock. Jimmy and Ralph reveal their names when they pull out their lunch. Jimmy then eats a sandwich, while Ralph pulls out a deck of &quot;pornographic pictures&quot;, to the curiosity of Jimmy. Later, Jimmy is taken to a hotel with Ralph, presumably to be molested, and later reports the crime. The perpetrator is arrested; Jimmy is put on probation.

Unsuspecting boy Mike is seen playing a game of basketball with a group of friends while ignoring a man watching them. The group decides to leave, but Mike decides to stay and practice. The man then joins Mike, which Mike believes is better than playing alone. Mike then decides to leave, and the stranger offers him a ride home. Mike accepts the offer, and enters the vehicle. Mike is supposedly killed that night, having &quot;traded his life for a newspaper headline&quot;.

Little boy Denny is tricked into entering a man&#x27;s car while he and his friend sort out newspapers. The car leaves, and Denny&#x27;s friend writes down the license plate number. Denny&#x27;s friend is later delivering papers and talks to Denny&#x27;s mother, who is seen watering her lawn. Denny&#x27;s mother decides to go inside and call the police. Right after Denny&#x27;s mother called the police, the car is quickly spotted, and the stranger is arrested.

Teenage Bobby waits in a beachside restroom where he and his friends were changing. Bobby&#x27;s friends decide to head home together, while Bobby decides to take a &quot;shortcut&quot; under a pier (where he faces the risk of being stuck). As Bobby walks to the shortcut, he notices a man, who was seen at the restroom, follows him. Bobby then waves to his friends, and runs to join them.

==Later releases==
A full-color version of the film was made in 1973, titled &quot;Boys Aware&quot;, using the same script and soundtrack with different actors. A third edition of the film was produced in 1979; unlike the first two installments, this version was written, edited and directed by Michael Heldman (though the closing credits acknowledged it as being &quot;Adapted from a Sid Davis Production&quot;). In a stark departure from its predecessors, this remake does not explicitly equate homosexuality with pedophilia, instead focusing on how the film&#x27;s target audience can recognize and prevent generally dangerous situations.

==Reception==
In 1965, Florida State Attorney Richard Gerstein recommended that high schools in Dade County, Florida, show the film to &quot;prevent&quot; homosexuality.

Margalit Fox of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 2006 that the film was one of several of Sid Davis&#x27; films that &quot;aged badly&quot;.

In 2015, a Missouri high school teacher at Raymore-Peculiar High School was suspended after showing &quot;Boys Beware&quot; to his students. He stated that he wanted to show what attitudes towards gay people had been like in previous eras.

The film was played through and mocked on the November 28, 2005 episode of &quot;The Opie &amp; Anthony Show&quot;, and became an occasional object of ridicule on the show thereafter.

A clip of the film was mocked in season 19 of the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

Charles Ferruzza of &quot;The Pitch&quot; stated that &quot;the situations in the film were pretty far-fetched by 1972 standards—though not as ridiculous as those in &quot;Marijuana&quot;&quot;.

<text>Louis Cha Leung-yung (; 10 March 1924 – 30 October 2018), better known by his pen name Jin Yong (), was a Chinese wuxia novelist and co-founder of &quot;Ming Pao.&quot; Cha authored 15 novels between 1955 and 1972 and became one of the most popular Chinese writers of all time, with over 100 million copies sold globally—excluding widespread pirated editions. Cha’s novels, which have been adapted into numerous TV dramas, films, and video games, are esteemed for their literary quality and universal appeal, resonating with both scholarly and popular audiences. 

==Early life==
Born on 10 March 1924, in Haining, Zhejiang in Republican China, Cha was named Zha Liangyong (Cha Liang-yung) and is the second of seven children. He hailed from the scholarly Zha clan of Haining (), whose members included notable literati of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties such as Zha Jizuo (1601–1676), Zha Shenxing (1650–1727) and Zha Siting (; died 1727). His grandfather, Zha Wenqing (), obtained the position of a &quot;tong jinshi chushen&quot; (third class graduate) in the imperial examination during the Qing dynasty. His father, Zha Shuqing (), was arrested and executed by the Communist government for allegedly being a counterrevolutionary during the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries in the early 1950s. Zha Shuqing was later posthumously declared innocent in the 1980s.

Zha Shuqing used to read him excerpts from the wuxia &quot;Huangjiang Nüxia&quot; (荒江女侠; &quot;Woman Warrior of the Wild River&quot;) by Gu Mingdao (顧明道) every day, which aroused Cha&#x27;s strong interest in the genre. Later, Cha took the initiative to read other works like &quot;Water Margin&quot; and &quot;The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants&quot;, which laid the foundation of his future as a wuxia novelist.

In 1937, Cha studied at Jiaxing No. 1 Middle School. In 1938, the Japanese army invaded Zhejiang, and the Jiaxing Middle School had to move hundreds of miles south to Lishui city in order to survive. Cha, as one of the students, only carried a quilt and a change of clothes, and the students had to trek on foot for 60 to 70 miles a day.

Cha was later expelled in 1941 after he wrote an article called &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures&quot; which satirized the training director sent by the Kuomintang for being vicious towards the students. Cha later reflected on this period as one of the most significant crises in his life. The expulsion not only deprived him of the opportunity to pursue his studies but he suddenly faced the issue of finding food and accommodation. Fortunately, with assistance from the principal, Zhang Yintong, Cha resumed his high school education at Quzhou No. 1 Secondary School and graduated in 1943.

== Education ==
Cha was admitted to the Department of Foreign Languages at the Central University of Political Affairs in Chongqing. Cha later dropped out of the school. He took the entrance exam and gained admission to the Faculty of Law at Soochow University, where he majored in international law with the intention of pursuing a career in the foreign service.

In 2005, Cha applied at the University of Cambridge for a doctorate in Asian Studies, which he obtained in 2010. In 2009, Cha enrolled in another doctoral program in Chinese literature at Peking University but never graduated.

== Career ==
Cha was a journalist. To help support his studies, he began work in 1947 as a journalist and translator for the Ta Kung Pao newspaper in Shanghai. He moved to Hong Kong in 1948 to work for the paper&#x27;s office in the city. When Cha was transferred to &quot;New Evening Post&quot; (of British Hong Kong) as Deputy Editor, he met Chen Wentong, who wrote his first wuxia novel under the pseudonym &quot;Liang Yusheng&quot; in 1953. Chen and Cha became good friends and it was under the former&#x27;s influence that Cha began work on his first serialised martial arts novel, &quot;The Book and the Sword&quot;, in 1955. In 1957, while still working on wuxia serialisations, he quit his previous job and worked as a scenarist-director and scriptwriter at Great Wall Movie Enterprises Ltd and Phoenix Film Company.

In 1959, Cha co-founded the Hong Kong newspaper &quot;Ming Pao&quot; with his high school classmate Shen Baoxin (). Cha served as its editor-in-chief for years, writing both serialised novels and editorials, amounting to some 10,000 Chinese characters per day. His novels also earned him a large readership. Cha completed his last wuxia novel in 1972, after which he officially retired from writing novels, and spent the remaining years of that decade editing and revising his literary works instead. The first complete definitive edition of his works appeared in 1979. In 1980, Cha wrote a postscript to Wu Gongzao&#x27;s tai chi classic &quot;Wujia Taijiquan&quot;, where he described influences from as far back as Laozi and Zhuang Zhou on contemporary Chinese martial arts.

By then, Cha&#x27;s wuxia novels had gained great popularity in Chinese-speaking areas. All of his novels have since been adapted into films, TV shows and radio dramas in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. The important characters in his novels are so well known to the public that they can be alluded to with ease between all three regions.

In the late 1970s, Cha was involved in Hong Kong politics. After Deng Xiaoping, a Jin Yong fan, came to power and initiated the reform and opening-up process, Cha became the first non-Communist Hong Konger to meet with Deng. He was a member of the Hong Kong Basic Law drafting committee but resigned in protest after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. He was also part of the Preparatory Committee set up in 1996 by the Chinese government to monitor the 1997 transfer of sovereignty.

In 1993, Cha prepared for retirement from editorial work and sold all his shares in &quot;Ming Pao&quot;.

The asteroid 10930 Jinyong (1998 CR2) has been named after him.

==Personal life==
Cha&#x27;s parents were Zha Shuqing () and Xu Lu (). He had four brothers and two sisters, and was the second oldest among the seven of them. His brothers were Zha Liangjian (; 1916–1988), Zha Lianghao (; b. 1934), Zha Liangdong (; 1930s) and Zha Liangyu (; b. 1936). His sisters were Zha Liangxiu (; b. 1926) and Zha Liangxuan (; 1928–2002). His cousin was educator and philanthropist Cha Liang-chao (: 1897 – 1982).

Cha married three times. His first wife was Du Zhifen (), whom he married in 1948 but divorced later. In 1953, he married his second wife, Zhu Mei (), a newspaper journalist. They had two sons and two daughters: Zha Chuanxia (), Zha Chuanti (), Zha Chuanshi () and Zha Chuanne (). Cha divorced Zhu in 1976 and married his third wife, Lin Leyi (; b. 1953), who was 29 years his junior and 16 years old when they first met. In 1976, his son Zha Chuanxia, then 19 years old, committed suicide after a quarrel with his girlfriend while studying at Columbia University.

== Death ==
On 30 October 2018, Cha died after a long illness at the Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital in Happy Valley, Hong Kong, aged 94.

His funeral service was held privately at Hong Kong Funeral Home in Quarry Bay on 13 November 2018 with his family and friends, with well known figures including writers Ni Kuang, Chua Lam, Chip Tsao, Benny Lee, producer Zhang Jizhong, actor Huang Xiaoming, former President of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Poon Chung-kwong, image designer Tina Liu, politicians Tung Chee-hwa and Edward Leong, and founder of Alibaba Group Jack Ma among them in attendance.

At noon, his coffin was moved to Po Lin Monastery at Ngong Ping, Lantau Island, where he was cremated and his ashes was interred at the Hoi Wui Tower&#x27;s columbarium.

==Decorations and conferments==

In addition to his wuxia novels, Cha also wrote many non-fiction works on Chinese history. For his achievements, he received many honours.

Cha was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by the British government in 1981. He was made a &quot;Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; (1992) and a &quot;Commandeur de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; (2004) by the French government.

Cha was also an honorary professor at Peking University, Zhejiang University, Nankai University, Soochow University, Huaqiao University, National Tsing Hua University, Hong Kong University (Department of Chinese Studies), the University of British Columbia, and Sichuan University. Cha was an honorary doctor at National Chengchi University, Hong Kong University (Department of Social Science), Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the Open University of Hong Kong, the University of British Columbia, Soka University and the University of Cambridge. He was also an honorary fellow of St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford and Robinson College, Cambridge, and a Waynflete Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.

When receiving his honorary doctorate at the University of Cambridge in 2004, Cha expressed his wish to be a full-time student at Cambridge for four years to attain a non-honorary doctorate. In July 2010, Cha earned his Doctor of Philosophy in oriental studies (Chinese history) at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge with a thesis on imperial succession in the early Tang dynasty.
==Works==
Cha wrote a total of 16 fictional works, of which only one is a non-wuxia autobiographical short story (Yue Yun). His wuxia works are made up of a novella (&quot;Blade-dance of the Two Lovers&quot;), 2 standalone novels (&quot;White Horse Neighs in the Western Wind&quot; and &quot;Ode to Gallantry&quot;), 11 interconnected novels of varying lengths, and a novelette (&quot;Sword of the Yue Maiden&quot;). Most of his novels were first published in daily instalments in newspapers, then later in 3 authorised book editions each with various changes to the plots and the characters. There are 4 editions of his novels:
#Serialised newspaper/magazine version (1955–1972)
#Old edition/1st edition (book form) (1956–1972)
#Revised edition/2nd edition (c.1970-1980)
#New Revised edition/3rd edition/Century edition (1999–2006)

The works are:

===Connections between the works===
All of Jin Yong&#x27;s novels, except &quot;White Horse Neighs in the Western Wind &quot; and &quot;Ode to Gallantry&quot; are connected, albeit weakly.

Aqing, the protagonist of the novelette &quot;Sword of the Yue Maiden&quot;, is the ancestor of Han Xiaoying from &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot;. &quot;Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils&quot; is a prequel; the Northern Beggar of the Five Greats, Hong Qigong succeeds Qiao Feng as the new chief of the Beggars&#x27; Gang in &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; and Duan Yu is the ancestor of the historical character Duan Zhixing who later becomes Reverend Yideng, another member of the Five Greats. &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Condor Heroes&quot; and &quot;The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber&quot; make up the Condor Trilogy (considered by many to be Cha&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;) and should be read in that order. Dugu Qiubai&#x27;s Heavy Iron Sword is used by Yang Guo and broken down to create the Heaven-Reliant Sword and the Dragon-Slaying Saber. Guo Xiang inherits the Heaven-Reliant Sword and passes it to her successors in the Emei School. Linghu Chong from &quot;The Smiling, Proud Wanderer&quot; learns Dugu Qiubai&#x27;s Nine Swords of Dugu from Feng Qingyang, a reclusive Mount Hua School swordsman. Some characters and schools from &quot;The Smiling, Proud Wanderer&quot; are mentioned in &quot;Sword Stained with Royal Blood&quot;.

In a very brief inner monologue in &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot;, Chengguan, a knowledgeable but naïve Shaolin monk, ponders two great swordsmen in the past who performed swordplay without following any defined stances: Dugu Qiubai and Linghu Chong. A few major characters from &quot;Sword Stained with Royal Blood&quot; also appear as minor characters. Wu Liuqi, a historical character from &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot;, is mentioned in the third edition of &quot;A Deadly Secret&quot; as the martial arts master of Mei Niansheng.

Numerous characters from &quot;The Book and the Sword&quot; appear in &quot;The Young Flying Fox&quot;, including Chen Jialuo. Hu Yidao, Miao Renfeng, Tian Guinong and the Feng family in &quot;The Young Flying Fox&quot; are the fictional descendants of the four bodyguards of Li Zicheng, who appears in the &quot;Sword Stained with Royal Blood&quot; and &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot;. &quot;The Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain&quot; is the sequel to &quot;The Young Flying Fox&quot;.

===Couplet===
After Cha completed all his works, it was discovered that the first characters of the first 14 titles can be joined to form a couplet (duilian) with 7 characters on each line:

;Traditional Chinese:
;Simplified Chinese:
;Loose translation:
Shooting a white deer, snow flutters around the skies;&lt;br&gt;
Smiling, [one] writes about the divine chivalrous one,
leaning against bluish lovebirds (or lover)

Cha stated that he had never intended to create the couplet. The couplet serves primarily as a handy mnemonic to remember all of Cha&#x27;s works for his fans.

*&quot;Sword of the Yue Maiden&quot; was left out because it would be an odd number, thus the couplet would not be complete, also because the &quot;Sword of the Yue Maiden&quot; was so short it was not even considered a book.

===Editions===

Most of Cha&#x27;s works were initially published in installments in Hong Kong newspapers, most often in &quot;Ming Pao&quot;. &quot;The Return of the Condor Heroes&quot; was his first novel serialised in &quot;Ming Pao&quot;, launched on 20 May 1959. Between 1970 and 1980, Cha revised all of his works. The revised works of his stories are known as the &quot;New Edition&quot; (), also known as &quot;Revised Edition&quot; (), in contrast with the &quot;Old Edition&quot; (), which refers to the original, serialised versions. Some characters and events were written out completely, most notably mystical elements and &#x27;unnecessary&#x27; characters, such as the &quot;Blood Red Bird&quot; () and &quot;Qin Nanqin&quot; (), the mother of Yang Guo in the first edition.

In Taiwan, the situation is more complicated, as Cha&#x27;s books were initially banned. As a result, there were multiple editions published underground, some of which were revised beyond recognition. Only in 1979 was Cha&#x27;s complete collection published by Taiwan&#x27;s Yuenching Publishing House ().

In China, the &quot;Wulin&quot; () magazine in Guangzhou was the first to officially publish Cha&#x27;s works, starting from 1980. Cha&#x27;s complete collection in Simplified Chinese was published by Beijing&#x27;s SDX Joint Publishing in 1994. Meanwhile, Mingheshe Singapore-Malaysia () published his collection, in Simplified Chinese for Southeast Asian readers in 1995.

From 1999 to 2006, Cha revised his novels for the second and last time. Each of his works was carefully revised, re-edited and re-issued in the order in which he wrote them. This revision was completed in spring 2006, with the publication of the last novel, &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot;. The newer revised edition, known variably as the &quot;New Century Edition&quot; (), &quot;New Revised Edition&quot; () and &quot;New New Edition&quot; (), is noted for its annotations where Cha answers previous criticisms directed at the historical accuracy of his works. In the newer revision, certain characters&#x27; personae were changed, such as Wang Yuyan, and many martial art skills and places have their names changed. This edition faced a number of criticisms from Cha&#x27;s fans, some of whom prefer the older storyline and names. The older 1970–80 &quot;New Edition&quot; () is no longer issued by Cha&#x27;s publisher Mingheshe (). In mainland China, it is re-issued as &quot;Langsheng, Old Edition&quot; () in simplified Chinese characters.

===Patriotism, jianghu and development of heroism===

Chinese nationalism or patriotism is a strong theme in Cha&#x27;s works. In most of his works, Cha places emphasis on the idea of self-determination and identity, and many of his novels are set in time periods when China was occupied or under the threat of occupation by non-Han Chinese peoples such as the Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols and Manchus. However, Cha gradually evolved his Chinese nationalism into an inclusionist concept which encompasses all present-day non-Han Chinese minorities. Cha expresses a fierce admiration for positive traits of non-Han Chinese people personally, such as the Mongols and Manchus. In &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot;, for example, he casts Genghis Khan and his sons as capable and intelligent military leaders against the corrupt and ineffective bureaucrats of the Han Chinese-led Song dynasty.

Cha&#x27;s references range from traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, martial arts, music, calligraphy, weiqi, tea culture, philosophical schools of thought such as Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism and imperial Chinese history. Historical figures often intermingle with fictional ones, making it difficult for the layperson to distinguish which are real.

His works show a great amount of respect and approval for traditional Chinese values, especially Confucian ideals such as the proper relationship between ruler and subject, parent and child, elder sibling and younger sibling, and (particularly strongly, due to the wuxia nature of his novels), between master and apprentice, and among fellow apprentices. However, he also questions the validity of these values in the face of a modern society, such as ostracism experienced by his two main characters – Yang Guo&#x27;s romantic relationship with his teacher Xiaolongnü in &quot;The Return of the Condor Heroes&quot;. Cha also places a great amount of emphasis on traditional values such as face and honour.

In all but his 14th work, &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot;, the protagonists or heroes are explored meticulously through their relationships with their teachers, their immediate kin and relatives, and with their suitors or spouses. In each, the heroes have attained the zenith in martial arts and most would be the epitome or embodiment of the traditional Chinese values in words or deeds, i.e. virtuous, honourable, respectable, gentlemanly, responsible, patriotic, and so forth.

In &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot;, Cha departed from his usual writing style, creating in its main protagonist Wei Xiaobao an antihero who is greedy, lazy, and utterly disdainful of traditional rules of propriety. Cha intentionally created an anticlimax and an &quot;antihero&quot; possessing none of the desirable traditional values and no knowledge of any form of martial arts, and dependent upon a protective vest made of alloy to absorb full-frontal attack when in trouble and a dagger that can cut through anything. Wei is a street urchin and womanizer and seems to have no positive qualities based on a superficial assessment; but he actually embodies the same essential qualities of the heroes from Cha&#x27;s earlier novels. The fiction writer Ni Kuang wrote a critique of all of Cha&#x27;s works and concluded that Cha concluded his work with &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; as a satire to his earlier work and to restore a balanced perspective in readers.

===Criticisms===
The study of Cha&#x27;s works has spun off a specific area of study and discussion: Jinology. For years, readers and critics have written works discussing, debating and analysing his fictional world of martial arts; among the most famous are those by Cha&#x27;s close friend and science fiction novelist, Ni Kuang. Ni is a fan of Cha, and has written a series of criticisms analysing the various personalities and aspects of his books called &quot;I Read Jin Yong&#x27;s Novels&quot; ().

Despite Cha&#x27;s popularity, some of his novels were banned outside of Hong Kong due to political reasons. A number of them were outlawed in the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the 1970s as they were thought to be satires of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution; others were banned in Taiwan as they were thought to be in support of the Chinese Communist Party. None of these bans are currently in force, and Cha&#x27;s complete collection has been published multiple times in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Many politicians on both sides of the Straits are known to be readers of his works; Deng Xiaoping, for example, was a well-known reader himself.

In late 2004, the People&#x27;s Education Publishing House () of the People&#x27;s Republic of China sparked controversy by including an excerpt from &quot;Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils&quot; in a new senior high school Chinese textbook. While some praised the inclusion of popular literature, others feared that the violence and unrealistic martial arts described in Cha&#x27;s works were unsuitable for high school students. At about the same time, Singapore&#x27;s Ministry of Education announced a similar move for Chinese-learning students at secondary and junior college levels.

* January 22 – At 9:30 in the evening, the Vigarano Meteorite splits as it falls to Earth in Italy at the locality of the same name, near Emilia. Weighing 11.5 kg (or 25 lb.), the stone that is recovered is the first of the CV chondrites named for the location. CV chondrites are described as the oldest rocks in the solar system. The other piece of the meteorite, weighing , is found a month later.
* April 10 – Halley&#x27;s Comet becomes visible with the naked eye (perihelion: April 20); Earth passes through its tail about May 19 (its next visit will be in 1986).
* December 30 – A nova (later referred to as DI Lacertae), is spotted in the constellation Lacerta, by Anglican minister and astronomer T. H. E. C. Espin, making him the first human to see the birth of the new star.
* Approximate date – The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram is developed by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.

==Cartography==
* Behrmann projection introduced.

==Chemistry==
* Albert Einstein and Marian Smoluchowski find the Einstein-Smoluchowski formula for the attenuation coefficient due to density fluctuations in a gas.
* Umetaro Suzuki isolates the first vitamin complex, aberic acid.
* Hoechst AG market Arsphenamine under the trade name &quot;Salvarsan&quot;, the first organic antisyphilitic, its properties having been discovered the previous fall by bacteriologist Sahachiro Hata during systematic testing in the laboratory of Paul Ehrlich; it rapidly becomes the world&#x27;s most widely prescribed drug.
* George Barger and James Ewens of Wellcome Laboratories in London first synthesize dopamine.
* Frederick Soddy shows that the radioelements mesothorium (later shown to be 228Ra), radium (226Ra, the longest-lived isotope), and thorium X (224Ra) are impossible to separate, leading to the identification of isotopes.

==Mathematics==
* Publication of the 1st volume of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, one of the most important and seminal works in mathematical logic and philosophy.
* First known use of the term &quot;Econometrics&quot; (in cognate form), by Paweł Ciompa.

==Physics==
* German physicist Theodor Wulf climbs the Eiffel Tower with an electrometer and discovers the first evidence of cosmic rays.

==Physiology and medicine==
* February 3 – The first pyloromyotomy, a surgery to correct the congenital narrowing (in infants) of the path between the stomach and the intestines (pyloric stenosis) is performed in Edinburgh by Sir Harold Stiles; however, the procedure is named for Dr. Wilhelm Ramstedt, who performs the surgery in 1911. 
* March – International Psychoanalytical Association established.

* May 18 – At the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of the Feeble-Minded, Henry H. Goddard introduces a system for classifying individuals with mental retardation based on intelligence quotient (IQ): moron for those with an IQ of 51–70, imbecile for those with an IQ of 26–50, and idiot for those with an IQ of 0-25.
* July 15 – Publication of the eighth edition of Emil Kraepelin&#x27;s &quot;Psychiatrie: Ein Lehrbuch für Studierende und Arzte&quot;, naming Alzheimer&#x27;s disease as a variety of dementia.
* October (approx.) – Approximate date of origin of Manchurian plague, a form of pneumonic plague which by December is spreading through northeastern China, killing more than 40,000.
* Thomas Hunt Morgan discovers that genes are located on chromosomes.
* Chicago cardiologist James B. Herrick makes the first published identification of sickle cells in the blood of a patient with anemia.
* Platelets are first named by James Homer Wright.
* Peyton Rous demonstrates that a malignant tumor can be transmitted by a virus (which becomes known as the Rous sarcoma virus, a retrovirus).
* Hans Christian Jacobaeus of Sweden performs the first thoracoscopic diagnosis with a cystoscope.

<doc id="349157" wikidata="Q714950" url="?curid=349157" title="Bob Holden">
<text>Robert Lee Holden Jr. (born August 24, 1949) is an American politician who served as the 53rd governor of Missouri from 2001 to 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the Missouri state treasurer from 1993 to 2001 and represented the 136th district in the Missouri House of Representatives from 1983 to 1989. Since leaving public office, Holden has worked at Webster University, where he founded the Holden Public Policy Forum, and serves as the president and chairman of the United States Heartland China Association.

==Early life==
Even though he was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on August 24, 1949, Holden was raised on a farm near Birch Tree. He attended a one-room school and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science at Missouri State University (then known as Southwest Missouri State), where he was a member of the Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity. He also attended the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he took courses specifically tailored for government executives. Holden met his wife Lori Hauser during his first campaign for the Missouri General Assembly and together, they have two boys, Robert and John D.

His brother, Calvin Ray Holden, is a Greene County Circuit Court judge.

==Early political career==

From 1975 to 1981, Holden worked in the office of State Treasurer James Spainhower, and worked on Spainhower&#x27;s 1980 campaign for governor. From 1983 to 1989, Holden was a member of the Missouri House of Representatives. During his tenure, he became chair of the appropriations committee.

In January of 1988, he announced his campaign for State Treasurer of Missouri against incumbent Republican Wendell Bailey. Holden&#x27;s race was considered to be one of the few potentially competitive races for Democrats that year, and Bailey was seen as the most vulnerable Republican up that year. Holden lost by over 40,000 votes in a close contest. After this loss, Holden worked as the chief of staff to U.S. Congressman Dick Gephardt.

In 1992, Holden made another bid, and this time was successful. Holden served in the position from 1993 to 2001.

==Governor of Missouri==
In the 2000 election, Holden was expected to face a tough primary against Lieutenant Governor Roger B. Wilson. But in March of 1998, Wilson declined a bid, mostly to spend more time with family, but also due to fundraising troubles against Holden. Holden won the Democratic nomination and faced Republican Congressman Jim Talent in the general election. During the campaign, Talent attacked Holden as an establishment candidate, while Holden compared Talent to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich when commenting on Talent&#x27;s proposals, saying &quot;this isn&#x27;t Washington&quot;.

Holden suffered from low name recognition early in the race, but by late October had begun leading Talent by several points in the polls. When voting began on November 7, Talent had an early lead. However, when votes from St. Louis came in around midnight, Holden took over the lead. At 2:35 a.m. on November 8, the Associated Press called the race for Holden, and Talent conceded shortly after. Holden&#x27;s victory over Talent marked the closest election for Missouri governor since 1976 and the first election since 1924 in which neither candidate received a majority of the vote.

Holden was inaugurated as governor in January 2001. His inauguration was the most elaborate and expensive in state history. The ceremony cost $1 million, of which $125,000 was paid from state government funds. Months after, there was still a remaining debt of $417,000. Although Holden&#x27;s inauguration ceremony received public financing equal to that of Missouri&#x27;s previous two governors, a perception that the inauguration was overly extravagant emerged and became a theme in opposition to his administration.

Not long after his inauguration, Holden faced a challenge from the new legislature. In special elections held weeks after his inauguration, Republicans won control of the state senate. This made Holden the first governor since Phil Donnelly to face a divided legislature. However, in spite of this, Holden was able to get some legislative accomplishments. Later that year, when Holden called a special session, the legislature passed a bill, which created a new prescription drug benefit for seniors. But the relationship would grow more troubled, with Holden at one point having three vetoes overridden in a year, the same number of vetoes among all Missouri governors post-Civil War.

Holden was pro-gun, but due to some negative effects that he felt proposed legislation would have on Missouri gun owners, and due to the results of a 1999 referendum, he vetoed a concealed-carry bill passed by the Missouri General Assembly. This was short-lived because his veto was overridden by both the Missouri House of Representatives and Senate and the concealed-carry bill passed into law in 2003. Several Republican legislators who had initially voted against the bill, such as Michael Gibbons of Kirkwood, switched sides to override Holden&#x27;s veto. 

Holden&#x27;s biggest challenge arguably was the economy and spending. At various times during his administration, Holden made drastic cuts in the state&#x27;s budget. This included cuts, proposed and enacted, to Medicaid, to education, and to the state government. Not helping matters, the state oversaw some 77,000 job losses in key industries due to the national recession. Holden did generally favor greater spending on state elementary and secondary education, but faced problems with raising funds. and he called the state legislature back into session after they had recessed for the year to ask for more state funding for education via raising taxes on casinos, but they refused additional spending. While wanting to raise taxes to pay for various programs, the Republican-led state legislature stymied these attempts.

Holden was a member of the National Governors Association and was elected chair of the Midwestern Governors’ Conference which led the Midwestern states’ efforts to stimulate the economy by focusing on education and research. He also chaired the Governor&#x27;s Ethanol Coalition and represented fellow governors on the National Medicaid Reform Task Force.

===2004 election===
In March of 2003, Holden announced his bid for re-election in 2004. He was challenged for the Democratic nomination for governor by a fellow Democrat, State Auditor Claire McCaskill, who had won the support of officials such as former governor Roger B. Wilson. McCaskill based her campaign on the broad-based disgruntlement with Holden that prompted even some Democrats to call him by the unflattering moniker &quot;OTB&quot; (One Term Bob). However, Holden still had some support among the state establishment, and prominent backers in U.S. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and former U.S. Senator Thomas Eagleton. After Holden&#x27;s approval rating steadily dropped during the second half of his term, McCaskill defeated Holden in the Democratic primary, marking the first primary loss for a sitting governor since 1994 and the first loss for a sitting governor in Missouri&#x27;s history.

McCaskill lost the November 2 general election to Republican Secretary of State Matt Blunt. Holden&#x27;s term ended on January 10, 2005.

==Life after politics==

Holden is currently the President and Chairman of the United States Heartland China Association, the United States Heartland China Association (USHCA) is a 501(c)3 bipartisan organization committed to building stronger ties between USHCA Region (21 states located in the US between the Great Lakes to the Gulf) and the People’s Republic of China. Their focus is on Trust Building efforts connecting government officials; business leaders; educational and community interests with like-minded institutions between the Heartland Region and the People’s Republic of China.

Previously, Holden taught political science and communications courses at Webster University. Governor Holden is the founder and Director of the Holden Public Policy Forum at Webster University. The Forum describes itself as &quot;a bi-partisan speakers series that will bring Governors, Senators, presidential candidates and private sector public policy leaders to St. Louis and the Webster University Old Post Office campus.&quot;

In 2016, Holden was appointed to the executive committee of Missouri&#x27;s statewide NAACP chapter.

Holden endorsed and campaigned on behalf of Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic primaries of the 2020 United States presidential election. Holden had previously endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries of the 2008 presidential campaign and served as a Missouri Co-Chair and a member of the Clinton campaign&#x27;s Education Policy Taskforce.

<doc id="349159" wikidata="Q212243" url="?curid=349159" title="Eleonora's falcon">
<text>Eleonora&#x27;s falcon (Falco eleonorae) is a medium-sized falcon. It belongs to the hobby group, a rather close-knit number of similar falcons often considered a subgenus &quot;Hypotriorchis&quot;. The sooty falcon is sometimes considered its closest relative, but while they certainly belong to the same lineage, they do not seem to be close sister species. The English name and the species name &quot;eleonorae&quot; commemorate Eleanor of Arborea, Queen or Lady-Judge () and national heroine of Sardinia, who in 1392, under the jurisdiction conferred by the Carta de Logu, became the first ruler in history to grant protection to hawk and falcon nests against illegal hunters. The genus name &quot;falco&quot; is from Late Latin &quot;falx&quot;, &quot;falcis&quot;, a sickle, referring to the claws of the bird.

==Description==

Eleonora&#x27;s falcon is a bird of prey, long with an wingspan. It is shaped like a large Eurasian hobby or a small slender peregrine falcon, with its long pointed wings, long tail and slim body. 

There are two colour morphs: The adult dark morph is all sooty brown, with black underwing coverts. The light morph is more like a juvenile Eurasian hobby, but has buff underparts, and also shows the contrast between the black underwing coverts and paler base to the flight feathers. Young birds are also like a large juvenile hobby, but the pale underparts contrast with darker wingtips and wing coverts. The call is a typical falcon &quot;kek-kek-kek&quot;.

==Habitat and distribution==
This species breeds on islands in the Mediterranean particularly off Greece (where two-thirds of the world&#x27;s population breeds), but also in Cyprus, the Canary Islands, Ibiza and off Spain, Italy, Croatia, Morocco and Algeria. Tilos in the Dodecanese is the breeding area for 10% of the world population of Eleonora&#x27;s falcons. Six hundred and fifty pairs of this species breed on this island according to research conducted by the Hellenic Ornithological Society and the European Union LIFE-Nature program of Tilos. It is rare as a vagrant north of its range. It also lives on the coast of Madagascar and Mozambique.

==Migration route==
This is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Madagascar. The migration route has been recently discovered and, contrary to previous suggestions, it has been demonstrated by satellite telemetry to be inland through the African continent. Traditionally it has been suggested to be coastal, with birds from the western end of the Mediterranean flying to Suez before flying south down the Red Sea, and across the Horn of Africa. However, recent satellite tracked animals by Spanish and German researchers have demonstrated an inland route through the Sahara Desert, the equatorial rainforests until reaching Kenya and Mozambique. The total distance covered during the flight has reached up to for a single one-way trip.

==Feeding and breeding==
It will take large insects, such as dragonflies, which are transferred from talons to beak and eaten in flight. It has also been recently observed catching and imprisoning small birds, removing their flight feathers and feeding them, sometimes days later, to their young. This is unique among bird species. Occasionally, it was observed as feeding on bats.

This species has a delayed breeding season, in late summer, because it is a specialist hunter of migrating birds which pass through the Mediterranean islands at this time of year. It captures small birds in flight, using its speed and aerobatic skills. Birds spend much time cruising along coastal cliffs with steady wingbeats watching for tired incoming migrants. During a fieldwork study in Mogador Island, Morocco, researchers found that Eleonora&#x27;s falcons are imprisoning live prey in rock crevices for later consumption. This falcon is unique in that it is one of the few species that breeds during early autumn, feeding its chicks with other migratory birds that are in abundance that period. It is also one of the few falcon species that creates breeding colonies. It nests on coastal cliffs, laying up to four eggs.

<doc id="349174" wikidata="Q2553780" url="?curid=349174" title="Virginia Peninsula">
<text>The Virginia Peninsula is located in southeast Virginia, bounded by the York River, James River, Hampton Roads and Chesapeake Bay. It is sometimes known as the &quot;Lower Peninsula&quot; to distinguish it from two other peninsulas to the north, the Middle Peninsula and the Northern Neck.

It is the site of historic Jamestown, founded in 1607 as the first English settlement in North America. Geographically located at the northwestern reaches, Charles City and New Kent counties are part of the Virginia Peninsula. In the 21st century, they are also considered part of the Richmond–Petersburg region. The rest of the Virginia Peninsula is all part of the Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News, VA–NC MSA (metropolitan statistical area) with a population of about 1.8 million. The Hampton Roads MSA is the common name for the metropolitan area that surrounds the body of water of the same name. It is the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the Southeast and the 32nd largest in the United States.

The land portion of Hampton Roads has been historically divided into two regions, the Virginia Peninsula or Peninsula on the north side, and South Hampton Roads on the south side. (Locally, South Hampton Roads is commonly called &quot;the Southside&quot;, but this is not to be confused with &quot;Southside Virginia&quot;, a separate region of the south central portion of Virginia located farther inland.) More recently, the boundaries of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area have expanded to include the two southernmost counties of the Middle Peninsula (Gloucester and Matthews), across the York River from the Virginia Peninsula.

== History ==

=== Spanish exploration ===
Early in the 16th century, Spanish explorers were the first Europeans to see the Chesapeake Bay, which they called &quot;Bahía de Madre de Dios&quot; or &quot;Bahía de Santa Maria.&quot; They were searching for the Northwest Passage to India and the Orient. They named the land now known as Virginia, as &quot;Ajacán&quot;.

The Spanish succeeded in founding a colonial settlement in the New World in 1565 at St. Augustine, Florida. It was the first founded by Europeans in what is now the United States. They established small Spanish outposts along the eastern coast into present-day Georgia and the Carolinas. The northernmost post was &quot;Santa Elena&quot; (today Port Royal, South Carolina). From there Juan Pardo was commissioned to lead expeditions into the interior, founding Fort San Juan in 1567–1568 at the regional Mississippian culture chiefdom of Joara. Located in present-day western North Carolina, this was the first European settlement in the interior of North America.

=== English settlement ===
The first permanent English settlement in North America was established in 1607 at Jamestown. The first continuously occupied settlement was at Kecoughtan in Elizabeth City County what is now the City of Hampton. Nearby, Fort Monroe, formerly the country&#x27;s oldest military base still in use, is located at Old Point Comfort. Old Point Comfort is also the site of the first landing of Africans in America, in 1619. After declaring independence from Great Britain, Virginia&#x27;s first state capital was Williamsburg. Also, the decisive battle of the American Revolution, the siege of Yorktown in 1781, took place on the Virginia Peninsula.

=== American Civil War ===
During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Union Army invaded the Virginia Peninsula as part of the Peninsula Campaign in 1862 to capture Richmond, beginning from Fort Monroe at the entrance to Hampton Roads, which had remained in Union control after Virginia seceded in 1861. At the outset of the Peninsula Campaign, the Battle of Hampton Roads between the first ironclad warships took place near the mouth of the James River off the eastern tip of Warwick County. The 1862 Siege of Yorktown took place along the York River. Finally, after a lengthy standoff, the largest Union Army of the war under General George B. McClellan chased the retreating Confederates through the Williamsburg Line and westward literally to the &quot;Gates of Richmond&quot;, where the swampy upper reaches of the Chickahominy River created a natural barrier behind which the defenders successfully held the Confederate capital, essentially prolonging the war for three more devastating years.

=== Post-war ===
As the region and Virginia rebuilt during Reconstruction, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) under the leadership of Collis P. Huntington was completed from Richmond to the Ohio River by 1871. Long a dream of Virginians, and later sponsored by both Virginia and West Virginia, the new railroad opened paths to ship products west, as well as offering an economically viable method of shipping the rich bituminous coal of the region to fuel the Industrial Revolution. However, the tidal portion of the James River, while navigable from Hampton Roads to the Fall Line at Richmond, couldn&#x27;t accommodate the deep drafts of collier ships.

The Peninsula had been long without a railroad, which had been newly developing technology beginning in the 1830s. In 1881, the Peninsula Extension of the C&amp;O was built from Richmond through Williamsburg to Newport News Point. There, Collis Huntington, his associates, and his Old Dominion Land Company developed his vision for the area. Within only 15 years, a rural farm community in Warwick County turned into the new independent city of Newport News, Virginia, by 1896 as new coal piers brought ships to what would become the world&#x27;s largest shipyard, Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. Hotels, houses, schools and businesses sprung up there, and at many points along the new rail line in Warwick, York and James City counties. Oyster Point became a shipping place for the watermen and the new town of Lee Hall, Virginia, emerged, and became an important point due to its proximity to Yorktown and later to the new military base which became the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Eustis. In Elizabeth City County, tracks were extended from Newport News to reach Old Point Comfort, where resort hotels and Buckroe Beach were developed. There, a new town was incorporated. Phoebus was named after one of its early leading citizens, Harrison Phoebus.

=== 20th century ===
In James City County, Toano became a major shipping point for the area&#x27;s truck farming and an entire new development planned by a C&amp;O land agent to attract farmers of Scandinavian descent from the colder regions of the American Mid-West emerged at Norge shortly after the start of the 20th century. Later in the first half of the 20th century, especially during the two world wars, massive military facilities were established on large reservations which today contain Langley Air Force Base, Fort Eustis, Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, and Camp Peary. To make way, all of Mulberry Island and entire communities including Lackey, Halstead&#x27;s Point, Penniman, Bigler&#x27;s Mill, and Magruder disappeared in the process. However, many of the displaced Virginians chose to relocate to Grove in James City County and other areas close by on the Peninsula.

After the capital of Virginia moved to Richmond in 1780 for greater security during the American Revolutionary War, Williamsburg became much less busy. By the early 20th century, it was described as a &quot;sleepy little hamlet&quot;, known best for the College of William and Mary and Eastern State Hospital, which was the successor to the country&#x27;s first mental hospital, as well as its fading memories and deteriorating colonial sites. All that changed dramatically beginning in 1926. The restoration and recreation of Colonial Williamsburg, one of the largest historic restorations ever undertaken, was championed by the Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin and the patriarch of the Rockefeller family, John D. Rockefeller Jr., along with the active participation of his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, who wanted to celebrate the patriots and the early history of the United States. The restoration of the colonial capital, construction of the Colonial Parkway by the U.S. National Park Service, several major enhancements at Jamestown and Yorktown, and development of several theme parks such as Busch Gardens Williamsburg beginning in the 1970s, all combined to help make the Historic Triangle area of Colonial Virginia become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States by the end of the 20th century.

== Local government ==
In Colonial times, and even in the first 150 years of the United States, much like Virginia as a whole, the Virginia Peninsula was in an almost constant state of change in terms of local government, largely due to growth, as counties were divided and towns were formed as the population grew. Some towns grew to become cities. Under the state constitutional changes in 1871, extant and future cities in Virginia became independent cities of the counties they had formerly been located within.

However, in the second half of the 20th century, an unprecedented wave of city-county-town local government consolidations took place in South Hampton Roads and on the Virginia Peninsula. Nowhere else in Virginia have rural areas and more dense cities been combined in such a manner as these two areas. The changes resulted in the two areas having Virginia&#x27;s cities with the largest land areas and the most farming, even over 30 years after the consolidations in some instances.

=== Newport News–Hampton Metropolitan Area (1960–1983) ===
In 1960, the &quot;Newport News–Hampton Metropolitan Statistical Area&quot; was designated a metropolitan area by the U.S. Census Bureau. It comprised the cities of Newport News, Hampton and York County.

In 1983, the MSA, comprising the cities of Newport News, Hampton, Poquoson and Williamsburg, and the counties of Gloucester, James City and York, was combined with the Norfolk–Virginia Beach–Portsmouth MSA and renamed the &quot;Norfolk–Virginia Beach–Newport News MSA&quot;.

=== Current political subdivisions ===
The Virginia Peninsula subregion includes four independent cities (Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson and Williamsburg) and two counties (James City County and York County). There are currently no incorporated towns. There were also a number of political subdivisions which are now extinct, primarily due to both growth of communities and consolidation of local government (see section below).

=== Defunct political subdivisions ===
Many incorporated (formally constituted) localities have become legally void, though most have not been abandoned by their citizens, with the notable exception of Jamestown. Exclusive of towns which became cities and still have the same name, no less than 4 shires, 2 counties, 4 towns, and 1 city no longer exist in the Virginia Peninsula area under their earlier names.

The following is a listing of these 11 extinct shire, counties, towns, and cities, with the approximate dates they existed:
* Jamestown, Virginia (1607) largely abandoned as a Town after 1699
* Kecoughtan, Virginia (1610), became part of Town and City of Hampton
* Middle Plantation (1632), became Williamsburg after 1699
* Elizabeth River Shire (1634–1643)
* Warwick River Shire (1634–1643)
* Charles River Shire (1634–1643)
* James City Shire (1634–1643)
* Elizabeth City County (1643–1952), now part of the city of Hampton.
* Warwick County (aka Warwick River County) (1643–1952), now part of the city of Newport News
* Town of Phoebus (1900–1952) (earlier known as unincorporated towns of Millwood, Roseland Farms, Chesapeake City), became part of city of Hampton
* City of Warwick (1952–1958), became part of city of Newport News

=== Major bridges, bridge tunnels, ferry system ===

Generally surrounded by water, the Virginia Peninsula is linked to other areas across the surrounding water barriers of the James and York Rivers, and the harbor of Hampton Roads by 2 bridge–tunnels, 2 large drawbridges, and a state-operated ferry system. These are:
* Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel
* Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel
* James River Bridge
* George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge
* Jamestown Ferry

=== Interstate Highways ===
* Interstate 64
* Interstate 664
* Hampton Roads Beltway

=== U.S. and State Routes ===
* U.S. Route 17
* U.S. Route 60
* U.S. Route 258
* State Route 5
* State Route 31
* State Route 32
* State Route 134
* State Route 143
* State Route 199 (Humelsine Parkway)

== Scenic parkways and trails ==
* Colonial Parkway
* Virginia Capital Trail

== U.S. military installations ==

The Virginia Peninsula is home to several military bases.

=== City of Hampton ===
Langley Air Force Base is located in Hampton. Fort Monroe had been the oldest installation in the region but closed in September 2011. The now decommissioned Fort Wool, located on a manmade island called Rip Raps across the mouth of Hampton Roads from Fort Monroe, is also in Hampton.

=== City of Newport News ===
Fort Eustis, home of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is in Newport News. A major military contractor, Newport News Shipbuilding, is also in the city.

=== York County ===
York County is home to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Yorktown Naval Weapons Station and a supply depot at nearby Cheatham Annex. Camp Peary and Coast Guard Training Center Yorktown are also located in York County.

=== James City County ===
Although each is primarily located in other jurisdictions, portions of Fort Eustis, Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, Cheatham Annex, and Camp Peary extend into James City County.

<text>Eretria (; , , , , literally &#x27;city of the rowers&#x27;) is a town in Euboea, Greece, facing the coast of Attica across the narrow South Euboean Gulf. It was an important Greek polis in the 6th and 5th century BC, mentioned by many famous writers and actively involved in significant historical events.

Excavations of the ancient city began in the 1890s and have been conducted since 1964 by the Greek Archaeological Service (11th Ephorate of Antiquities) and the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece.

== History of Eretria ==

=== Prehistory ===
The first evidence for human activity in the area of Eretria are pottery shards and stone artifacts from the late Neolithic period (3500–3000 BC) found on the Acropolis as well as in the plain. No permanent structures have yet been found. It is therefore unclear whether a permanent settlement existed at that time.

The first known settlement from the Early Helladic period (3000–2000 BC) was located on the plain. A granary and several other buildings, as well as a pottery kiln, have been found so far. This settlement was moved to the top of the Acropolis in the Middle Helladic period (2000–1600 BC) because the plain was flooded by the nearby lagoon. In the Late Helladic period (1600–1100 BC), the population dwindled and the remains found so far have been interpreted as an observation post. The site was abandoned during the Greek Dark Ages.

=== Archaic to Roman period ===
The oldest archaeological finds date the foundation of the city to the Greek Dark Ages.


The earliest surviving mention of Eretria was by Homer (&quot;Iliad&quot; 2.537), who listed Eretria as one of the Greek cities which sent ships to the Trojan War. In the 8th century BC, Eretria and her near neighbour and rival, Chalcis, were both powerful and prosperous trading cities. Eretria controlled the Aegean islands of Andros, Tenos and Ceos. They also held territory in Boeotia on the Greek mainland. Eretria was also involved in the Greek colonisation and founded the colonies of Pithekoussai and Cumae in Italy together with Chalcis.
At the end of the 8th century BC, however, Eretria and Chalcis fought a prolonged war (known mainly from the account in Thucydides as the Lelantine War) for control of the fertile Lelantine plain. Little is known of the details of this war, but it is clear that Eretria was defeated. The city was destroyed and Eretria lost her lands in Boeotia and her Aegean dependencies. Neither Eretria nor Chalcis ever again counted for much in Greek politics. As a result of this defeat, Eretria turned to colonisation. She planted colonies in the northern Aegean, on the coast of Macedon, in Italy, and in Sicily. 

It became an important city in the 6th/5th century BC mentioned by many famous writers and actively involved in significant historical events. The Eretrians were Ionians and were thus natural allies of Athens. When the Ionian Greeks in Asia Minor rebelled against Persia in 499 BC, Eretria joined Athens in sending aid to the rebels, because Miletus had supported Eretria in the Lelantine War. The rebels burned Sardis, but were defeated and the Eretrian general Eualcides was killed. Darius made a point of punishing Eretria during his invasion of Greece. In 490 BC the city was sacked and burned by the Persians under the admiral Datis. In retribution for the stout resistance, the victors killed all the male citizens and deported women and children barefoot to Arderikka in Susiana, Persia, forcing them into slavery. The Persians also destroyed the great temple of Apollo, built around 510 BC; parts of a pediment were found in 1900, including the torso of a statue of Athena.

Eretria was rebuilt shortly afterwards and took part with 600 hoplites in the Battle of Plataea (479 BC). The ancient writer Plutarch mentions a woman of Eretria, &quot;who was kept by Artabanus&quot; at the Persian court of Artaxerxes, who facilitated the audience that Themistocles obtained with the Persian king. During the fifth century BC the whole of Euboea became part of the Delian League, which later became the Athenian Empire. Eretria and other cities of Euboea rebelled unsuccessfully against Athens in 446 BC. During the Peloponnesian War Eretria was an Athenian ally against her Dorian rivals Sparta and Corinth. But soon the Eretrians, along with the rest of the Empire, found Athenian domination oppressive. When the Spartans defeated the Athenians at the Battle of Eretria in 411 BC, the Euboean cities all rebelled.

After her eventual defeat by Sparta in 404 BC, Athens soon recovered and re-established her hegemony over Euboea, which was an essential source of grain for the urban population. The Eretrians rebelled again in 349 BC and this time the Athenians could not recover control. In 343 BC supporters of Philip II of Macedon gained control of the city, but the Athenians under Demosthenes recaptured it in 341 BC.

====Macedonian period====
The Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, in which Philip defeated the combined armies of the rest of the Greeks, marked the end of the Greek cities as independent states. However, under Macedonian rule Eretria experienced a new period of prosperity which lasted until the 3rd century as attested by many inscriptions, by extensions to the west and south sections of the walls and by many other private and public new buildings including the circus.

From 318 to 312 BC King Cassander lived at Eretria and commissioned the painter Philoxenus of Eretria to paint the battle of Issus, of which the famous Alexander Mosaic in the Naples museum is a copy and the wall paintings in Phillip&#x27;s tomb at Vergina are connected.

From 304 BC Demetrius I granted the city partial autonomy. During this time the city was governed by Menedemos who founded the Eretrian school of philosophy. After the Chremonidean War (267–262 BC) a permanent Macedonian garrison was installed.

====Roman period====
In 198 BC in the Second Macedonian War Eretria was plundered by the Romans. The admiral Lucius Quinctius Flamininus was joined by the allied fleets of Attalus I of Pergamon and of Rhodes, and used them in besieging Eretria. He eventually took the town during a night-time assault during which the citizens surrendered. Flamininus came away with a large collection of art works as his share of the booty.

Eretria became an object of contention between the Romans and Macedonians, but was given partial independence and experienced a new period of prosperity. Under the Romans, athletic contests for children and youths called the Romaia were held.

In 87 BC it was finally destroyed in the First Mithridatic War and gradually declined further.

=== Temple of Apollo Daphnephoros ===
The temple of Apollo Daphnephoros is the most important and wider known monument of Eretria, featuring sparkling and sharp sculptures on the pediments, their postures well in advance of experiments in Athens of the time. Together with its enclosure it constituted the sacred temenos of Apollo, a religious centre and fundamental place of worship within the core of the ancient city, to the north of the Agora.

According to the Homeric hymn to Apollo, when the god was seeking for a location to found its oracle, he arrived to the Lelantine plain. The first temple is dated to the Geometric period and was situated probably near the harbour, as the sea then reached the area of the Agora. The &quot;hecatompedon&quot; (hundred-footer) apsidal edifice is the earliest in its type among those mentioned by Homer, and slightly after the hecatompedon temple of Hera on the island of Samos. It was flanked to the south by another apsidal building which also came to light: the so-called &quot;Daphniforio&quot; or &quot;space with laurels&quot; (7.5 x 11.5m) is the most ancient edifice in Eretria, related to the early cult of Apollo in Delphi.

At the centre of this edifice were preserved the clay bases supporting the laurel trunks that propped up the roof. In the early sixteenth century a second hecatompedon temple was erected through earth fills upon its Geometric predecessor, on a solid artificial terrace. This temple had wooden columns (six at the narrow sides and nineteen at the longer sides), and was subsequently covered with earth in order to build the later and most renowned of all temples in the city.

Construction started at the late sixth century BC (520-490 BC) and the temple was perhaps still unfinished when the Persians razed the city in 490 BC. Poros stone and marble were the materials used for this Doric peristyle (surrounded by colonnades) temple (6 x 14 columns). It had a &quot;prodomos&quot; (anteroom) and an &quot;opisthodomos &quot;(back section) arranged with two columns in antis; the cella (in Greek &quot;sekos&quot; was divided into three naves by two interior colonnades. After the destruction of the city by the Persians, the temple was repaired and remained in use; yet in 198 BC it was destroyed again, this time by the Romans, a fact which initiated the gradual abandonment and dilapidation of the monument until the first century BC. Some important sculptures were found and are displayed in the Chalcis museum. One of the Amazons was salvaged in antiquity and carried off to Rome. Several Niobids perhaps from the pediment of the temple were probably taken to Rome by Augustus including the dying Niobid and the running Niobid (now in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek). 

The majority of architectural parts from this temple and other sanctuaries of the city were re-used as construction material; only a few (column) drums together with fragmented capitals and triglyphs remain from the superstructure of the monument.

Of the sumptuous sculptural decoration survive only parts of the west pediment featuring in relief the fight of the Amazons (or Amazonomachy, a usual motif for the iconography at the time). The centre was occupied by Athena and is partially preserved, depicting her trunk with the Gorgoneion on the thorax; a superb work of art is the complex of Theseus and Antiope marked by sensitivity and softness of the form, internal force and clarity, despite the ornamental tendency obvious in the coiffures and the folds of their clothes. These sculptures are impregnated by the rules of archaic plasticity; the analogies are rendered in an innovative manner, a precursor to the idealization and the force of the classical art. The entire composition supposedly featured chariots to Athena&#x27;s right and left, one chariot presumably carrying Theseus and Antiope, while Hercules might ride the other, and the picture could be complemented by fighting Amazons and a dead warrior. The east pediment possibly narrated the Gigantomachy (fight of the Giants). The details of the faces and the clothes were coloured, thus rendering the depiction more vivid. Fragmented sculptures that may be part of the temple after the destruction by the Persians (warrior, Amazon and Athena&#x27;s trunk) have been located in Rome. Today are visible only the foundations of the Post-Archaic temple, as well as remains of the Geometric temples uncovered in lower deposits.

The temples in the temenos of Apollo Daphniforos were excavated between 1899 and 1910 by Κ. Kourouniotis. Further investigations were conducted by Mrs. I. Konstantinou and by the Swiss Archaeological School.

===The ancient theatre of Eretria===
The most impressive monument of ancient Eretria, one of the oldest known theatres, lies in the western section of town, between the western gate, the stadium and the upper gymnasium; the temple of Dionysos was found at its south-west end. As indicated by the architectural remains of the scene, the initial construction phase followed the invasion by the Persians and the reconstruction of the city in the fifth century BC, whereas the fourth century BC marked the site&#x27;s peak.

A striking fact is the construction of the &quot;cavea&quot; (Gr. , auditorium) on an artificial hill surrounded by numerous retaining walls, instead of taking advantage of the citadel&#x27;s slopes. During the first building phase, the scene looked like a palace, disposed of five adjacent rectangle rooms and found itself at the same level as the circular orchestra, leading to it via three entrances. At its peak (fourth century BC), the theatre suffered transformations and was shaped to a large extent in its present form. The cavea comprised eleven tiers divided by ten staircases. The circular orchestra was transferred for 8m to the north, and was lowered by 3m. The scene was amplified by two backstages connected through a portico with an Ionic façade, thus raising above the orchestra. This difference in heights was evened up by a vaulted underground gallery, leading through the scene to the centre of the orchestra; this was in all probability the &quot;charonian stairway&quot; (stairs of Hades) allowing actors impersonating chthonic deities and the dead to appear and perform at the orchestra.

Local poros stone was used for the foundation and limestone for the parodoi (passageways), which sloped to the orchestra in order to diminish the difference in height with the cavea. The theatre seated 6,300 spectators and is reminiscent in form to the Theatre of Dionysos in Athens, after transformation of the latter in 330 BC. Following the destruction of Eretria by the Romans in 198 BC, it was rebuilt with lower quality materials and the rooms to the south of the &quot;parodos&quot; were then apparently decorated with colour mortars of the first Pompeian style.

Most benches have been looted. There are still the impressive remains of the scene, especially the vaulted underground passage leading to the orchestra centre. Excavation of the monument was undertaken by the American Archaeological School, while the local Ephorate of Antiquities strived greatly for its restoration.

===Temple of Isis===

Among the most interesting monuments of ancient Eretria is the Iseion, a temple sacred to the goddess Isis and other Egyptian deities. Situated to the south of the town, between the baths and the Lower Gymnasium or the palaistra (wrestling area), it extends behind the small harbour, a detail that correlates the temenos with merchants who had their interests in Eretria. According to excavation and inscription testimonies, the temple was probably built in the fourth century BC and was surrounded by other edifices and auxiliary spaces. The initiation to the cult of Isis and the Egyptian deities occurred during the Hellenistic period by Greek merchants who came to Greece from Egypt after the unification of the then known world by Alexander the Great. Their worship in Eretria has also been attested by inscriptions, of which the most important is set on a limestone block to the left of the prodomos (anteroom) before the cella.

The temple of Isis was initially simple and oriented to the east, with a prodomos that was distyle (two-columned) in antis. The ceremonial clay statue of the goddess stood on a base within the cella. In front of the temple was the altar and nearby a small drain tank. The temple was reconstructed after the destruction of the city by the Romans in 198 BC: it then acquired a larger external prodomos on ameliorated foundations and was surrounded by porticoes on three sides (north, south and west). Only the south-west end of the portico was covered by a roof. The columns were later replaced by a parapet. At the centre of the east forecourt was a portal facing the entrance of the sanctuary. Fifteen more edifices and auxiliary spaces lied to the north, considered by the excavators as places of purification. Among them was a courtyard and an &quot;andren&quot; (dining hall for male residents), while one room of the complex had a superb mosaic floor featuring lozenges.

Excavations at the &quot;temenos&quot; sacred to Isis and other Egyptian deities were conducted in 1917 by the then Ephor of Antiquities for the island of Evia (Euboea), Ι. Papadakis. In recent years, the Archaeological Service of the Ministry of Culture undertook further excavations in the wider area of the temple, which brought to light an additional complex of courtyards and rooms directly related to the sanctuary.

=== House with the mosaics ===

This splendid house was built in ca. 370 B.C. and remained in use for about a century. It is distinguished by its floors, covered with elegant pebble mosaics representing mythological scenes: Nereids on the back of a seahorse, legendary battles between Arimaspians and griffins, sphinxes and panthers. The building is a representative specimen of the Classical and Hellenistic domestic architecture.

In the first century BC a funerary monument with a massive rectangular &quot;peribolos&quot; was erected over the ruins of the house.

The monument was excavated between 1975 and 1980.

=== Macedonian tomb of Erotes ===
The so-called &quot;tomb of Erotes&quot; lies on a hill to the northwest of Eretria city and counts among the most significant monuments of Evia island. Based on the findings, it is dated to the fourth century BC, the time when these characteristic burial monuments of the Macedonian type make their appearance in southern Greece after the descent of the Macedons. More Macedonian tombs were found in the wider area around Eretria, namely in the settlements of Kotroni and Amarynthos.

The tomb of Erotes consists of a single vaulted chamber and a &quot;dromos&quot; (entrance passageway) of stone and bricks. The burial chamber is reminiscent of a residential room; it is built of poros stone plastered with white mortar. During the excavation were found two replicas of painted stone thrones bearing relief decoration. At the rear corners of the burial chamber were two marble bed-shaped sarcophagi. The tomb had been pillaged. Among the findings today exhibited in the New York Metropolitan Museum, are bronze vases and clay statuettes of Erotes (Amors), which inspired the tomb&#x27;s conventional name. Above the tomb was uncovered a stone-built construction, probably the basis of a sepulchre.

The monument was excavated in 1897 and is well preserved to date.
=== Tholos ===
Excavations carried out by the Greek Archaeological Service have revealed the limestone foundations and crepis of a circular building. It was erected in the fifth century BC in the Agora of the city, and underwent several modifications in the fourth and the third centuries BC. A circular bothros has also survived at the centre of the monument.
=== Gymnasium and Eileithyia&#x27;s sanctuary ===

In 1917, archaeologists uncovered traces of a gymnasium dating to the 4th century BC. A sanctuary dedicated to Eileithyia, had been placed in the northwestern section of the building. Also, excavations in the area of the sanctuary found a well containing some 100 terracotta cups dating to the 3rd century BC. In 2018, new excavations in the area revealed more buildings.

== Modern Eretria ==

Modern Eretria was created in 1824 by refugees from Psara after the Destruction of Psara, who gave to their settlement the name &quot;Nea Psara&quot;. The ancient name was revived during the first years of the independent Greek state. The new city plan was appointed by Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert.

The modern town of Eretria is now a popular beachside resort. The historic and archaeological finds from Eretria and Lefkandi are displayed in the Eretria Museum, established by the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece.

The town can be reached from Skala Oropou, Attica by ferry or via Halkida by road. It is an important station on the way to the south of the island. It has many taverns and a long beach promenade. The archaeological excavations are located on the northern edge of the modern town.

==Municipality==
The municipality Eretria was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following two former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Amarynthos
*Eretria

The municipality has an area of 168.557 km2, the municipal unit 58.648 km2.

<text>The lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) is a small falcon. This species breeds from the Mediterranean across Afghanistan and Central Asia, to China and Mongolia. It is a summer migrant, wintering in Africa and Pakistan and sometimes even to India and Iraq. It is rare north of its breeding range, and declining in its European range. The genus name derives from Late Latin &quot;falx&quot;, &quot;falcis&quot;, a sickle, referencing the claws of the bird, and the species name commemorates the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Naumann.

==Description==
It is a small bird of prey, in length with a wingspan. It looks very much like the larger common kestrel but has proportionally shorter wings and tail. It shares a brown back and barred grey underparts with the larger species. The male has a grey head and tail like male common kestrels, but lacks the dark spotting on the back, the black malar stripe, and has grey patches in the wings.

The female and young birds are slightly paler than their relative, but are so similar that call and structure are better guides than plumage. The call is a diagnostic harsh &quot;chay-chay-chay&quot;, unlike the common kestrel&#x27;s &quot;kee-kee-kee&quot;. Neither sex has dark talons as is usual in falcons; those of this species are a peculiar whitish-horn color. This, however, is only conspicuous when birds are seen at very close range, e.g. in captivity.

==Taxonomy==
Despite its outward similarity, this species appears not to be closely related to the common kestrel. In fact, mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence analysis places it at a basal position with regards to the other &quot;true&quot; kestrels (i.e., excluding the American kestrel and probably the grey African kestrels as well). Its divergence is tentatively placed to around the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (Messinian to Zanclean, or about 7–3.5 mya). The morphological similarity with the common kestrel is most puzzling, but still it appears to betray the present species&#x27; actual relationships: the lack of a malar stripe seems ancestral for kestrels, and the grey wing colour unites the lesser kestrel with most other &quot;Falco&quot; species, but not the other true kestrels.

==Ecology==
The lesser kestrel is, as the name implies, a smaller and more delicate bird than the common kestrel, and it is entirely sympatric in its breeding range with it; they compete to a limited extent. Thus, the possibility that there is some form of adaptive advantage to the similar coloration deserves study. Considering that the lesser kestrel would in fact have an advantage if some would-be predators confused it with the larger species and consequently avoided it, it might be a case of Müllerian mimicry.

The lesser kestrel eats insects, but also small birds, reptiles and rodents (especially mice), which are often taken on the ground. It nests colonially on buildings, cliffs, or in tree holes, laying up to 3–6 eggs. No nest structure is built, which is typical for falcons. On their wintering grounds in West Africa, lesser kestrels favor a &quot;latitude belt&quot; through Senegal where locusts and grasshoppers are plentiful. Surveys of lesser kestrels wintering in January 2007 by the Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux revealed them roosting communally. A roost in Senegal discovered during one of the surveys held 28,600 birds, together with 16,000 scissor-tailed kites &quot;Chelictinia riocourii&quot;.

It is widespread and plentiful on a global scale, and the IUCN have classed it as Least Concern. Apart from possible habitat destruction, it appears that indiscriminate use of pesticides has a strong effect on this species due to its insectivorous habits.

<doc id="349189" wikidata="Q221409" url="?curid=349189" title="Encyclical">
<text>An encyclical was originally a circular letter sent to all the churches of a particular area in the ancient Roman Church. At that time, the word could be used for a letter sent out by any bishop. The word comes from the Late Latin (originally from the Latin , a Latinization of Greek (), meaning &quot;circular&quot;, &quot;in a circle&quot;, or &quot;all-round&quot;, also part of the origin of the word encyclopedia). The term is now primarily associated with papal encyclicals.

The term has been used by Catholics, Anglicans and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Catholic usage==
Although the term &quot;encyclical&quot; originally simply meant a circulating letter, it acquired a more specific meaning within the context of the Catholic Church. In 1740, Pope Benedict XIV wrote a letter titled &quot;Ubi primum&quot;, which is generally regarded as the first encyclical. The term is now used almost exclusively for a kind of letter sent out by the pope.

For the modern Catholic Church, a papal encyclical is a specific category of papal document, a kind of pastoral letter concerning Catholic doctrine, sent by the pope and usually addressed especially to patriarchs, primates, archbishops and bishops who are in communion with the Holy See. The form of the address can vary widely and may concern bishops in a particular area, or designate a wider audience. Papal encyclicals usually take the form of a papal brief because of their more personal nature as opposed to the formal papal bull.

Like most papal documents the title of the encyclical is usually taken from its first few words (its &quot;incipit&quot;). They are usually written in Latin unless particularly addressed to the Bishops or the church of one region. Papal encyclicals not in Latin include the 1931 Italian Non abbiamo bisogno against Italian fascist suppression of groups like Catholic Action, and the 1937 German Mit brennender Sorge against the Nazi idolization of race and nation.

===Papal use===
In the encyclical &quot;Humani generis&quot;, Pope Pius XII held that papal encyclicals, even when they are of ordinary magisterium, can nonetheless be sufficiently authoritative to end theological debate on a particular question:

Catholic social teaching has advanced 19 encyclicals. On social issues, Pope Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; (1891), which was followed by &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; (1931) of Pius XI and &quot;Centesimus annus&quot; (1991) of John Paul II. Pope Pius XII issued ten encyclicals, mostly after 1945, three of them protesting against the Soviet invasion of Hungary which suppressed the Hungarian Revolution in 1956: &quot;Datis nuperrime&quot;, &quot;Laetamur admodum&quot; and &quot;Luctuosissimi eventus&quot;. Pope Paul VI published an encyclical &quot;Humanae vitae&quot; on the topic of birth control.

==Anglican usage==
Amongst Anglicans the term &quot;encyclical&quot; was revived in the late 19th century. It is applied to circular letters issued by the English primates.

==Important Eastern Orthodox encyclicals==
* Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs (1848)
* Patriarchal encyclical of 1895
* Patriarchal encyclical of 1920
* Patriarchal encyclical of 2012

<text>Chang Chau-hsiung (; born 3 February 1942) is a Taiwanese physician and politician. He served as the vice-chairman of People First Party from 2000 to 2016.

==Early life and education==
Born in Takao Prefecture, Taiwan, Empire of Japan, Chang was a physician who graduated from National Taiwan University with a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) in 1967.

==Early career==
In 1967, Chang finished his surgical training in the university hospital. He then served as a resident doctor and chief resident doctor until 1972. He then went to the United States for further training. He worked in Michael Reese Hospital, Texas Heart Institute and Mokral Hospital for medical research and surgical practice. He returned to Taiwan in 1976.

Chang worked in the university hospital as a part-time attending physician from 1976 to 1977. He worked at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1976 to 1999, and was the president of Chang Gung University from 1997 to 1999. He is the author of sixteen and coauthor of 167 scientific citation index papers.

==Political career==
Chang, a former adviser to Chen Shui-bian, ran as an independent vice-presidential candidate (on the ticket of James Soong) in the 2000 election. Along with Soong, he established the People First Party in 2000, after their defeat in the presidential election. Chang was named the PFP&#x27;s top choice as a fusion candidate for the 2002 Kaohsiung mayoral election. When Chang ended his campaign, the PFP moved to support Chang Po-ya. The Pan-Blue coalition formally selected Kuomintang member Huang Jun-ying. In 2006, Chang announced his retirement from politics after Soong heavily lost in the Taipei mayoral election.
Chang resigned the vice chairmanship of the People&#x27;s First Party in July 2016.

==Personal life==
He is married to Lee Fang-hui () with two sons.

<doc id="349208" wikidata="Q487378" url="?curid=349208" title="Delphi (software)">
<text>Delphi is a general-purpose programming language and a software product that uses the Delphi dialect of the Object Pascal programming language and provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for rapid application development of desktop, mobile, web, and console software, currently developed and maintained by Embarcadero Technologies.

Delphi&#x27;s compilers generate native code for Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux (x64).

Delphi includes a code editor, a visual designer, an integrated debugger, a source code control component, and support for third-party plugins. The code editor features Code Insight (code completion), Error Insight (real-time error-checking), and refactoring. The visual forms designer has the option of using either the Visual Component Library (VCL) for pure Windows development or the FireMonkey (FMX) framework for cross-platform development. Database support is a key feature and is provided by FireDAC (Database Access Components). Delphi is known for its fast compilation speed, native code, and developer productivity.

Delphi was originally developed by Borland as a rapid application development tool for Windows as the successor of Turbo Pascal. Delphi added full object-oriented programming to the existing language, and the language has grown to support generics, anonymous methods, closures, and native Component Object Model (COM) support.

Delphi and its C++ counterpart, C++Builder, are interoperable and jointly sold under the name RAD Studio. There are Professional, Enterprise, and Architect editions, with the higher editions having more features at a higher price. There is also a free-of-charge Community edition, with most of the features of Professional, but restricted to users and companies with low revenue.

==Features==
Delphi supports rapid application development (RAD). Prominent features are a visual designer and two application frameworks, Visual Component Library (VCL) for Windows and FireMonkey (FMX) for cross-platform development.

Delphi uses the Pascal-based programming language Object Pascal created by Anders Hejlsberg for Borland (now IDERA) as the successor to Turbo Pascal. It supports native cross-compilation to many platforms including Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.

To better support development for Microsoft Windows and interoperate with code developed with other software development tools, Delphi supports independent interfaces of Component Object Model (COM) with reference counting class implementations, and support for many third-party components. Interface implementations can be delegated to fields or properties of classes. Message handlers are implemented by tagging a method of a class with the integer constant of the message to handle.

Database connectivity is extensively supported through VCL database-aware and database access components.

Later versions have included upgraded and enhanced runtime library routines, some provided by the community group FastCode.

===Characteristics===
Delphi uses a strongly typed high-level programming language, intended to be easy to use and originally based on the earlier Object Pascal language. Pascal was originally developed as a general-purpose language &quot;suitable for expressing the fundamental constructs known at the time in a concise and logical way&quot;, and &quot;its implementation was to be efficient and competitive with existing FORTRAN compilers&quot; but without low-level programming facilities or access to hardware. Turbo Pascal and its descendants, including Delphi, support access to hardware and low-level programming, with the facility to incorporate code written in assembly language and other languages. Delphi&#x27;s object-orientation features only class- and interface-based polymorphism. Metaclasses are first class objects. Objects are references to the objects (as in Java), which Delphi implicitly de-references, so there is usually no need to manually allocate memory for pointers to objects or use similar techniques that some other languages need. There are dedicated reference-counted string types, and also null-terminated strings.

Strings can be concatenated by using the &#x27;+&#x27; operator, rather than using functions. For dedicated string types, Delphi handles memory management without programmer intervention. Since Borland Developer Studio 2006, there are functions to locate memory leaks.

Delphi includes an integrated IDE. The Delphi products all ship with a run-time library (RTL) and a Visual Component Library (VCL), including most of its source code. Third-party components (sometimes with full source code) and tools to enhance the IDE or for other Delphi related development tasks are available, some free of charge. The IDE includes a GUI for localization and translation of created programs that may be deployed to a translator; there are also third-party tools with more features for this purpose. The VCL framework maintains a high level of source compatibility between versions, which simplifies updating existing source code to a newer Delphi version. Third-party libraries typically need updates from the vendor but, if source code is supplied, recompilation with the newer version may be sufficient. The VCL was an early adopter of dependency injection or inversion of control; it uses a reusable component model, extensible by the developer. With class helpers, new functionality can be introduced to core RTL and VCL classes without changing the original source code of the RTL or VCL.

The compiler is optimizing and is a single-pass compiler. It can optionally compile to a single executable which does not require DLLs. Delphi can also generate standard DLLs, ActiveX DLLs, COM automation servers and Windows services.

The Delphi IDEs since Delphi 2005 increasingly support refactoring features such as method extraction and the possibility to create UML models from the source code or to modify the source through changes made in the model.

Delphi has communities on the web, where also its employees actively participate.

===Backward compatibility===

Delphi is one of the languages where backward compatibility is close to 100%. Although each new release of Delphi attempts to keep as much backward compatibility as possible to allow existing code reuse, new features, new libraries, and improvements sometimes make newer releases less than 100% backward compatible.

Since 2016, there have been new releases of Delphi every six months, with new platforms being added approximately every second release.

===Frameworks===

Delphi offers two frameworks for visual application development, VCL and FireMonkey (FMX):
* Visual Component Library (VCL) is the framework for developing pure Windows applications. VCL is a long-standing framework, included in the first release of Delphi and actively developed ever since then.
* FireMonkey (later abbreviated FMX), was released in 2011, as part of Delphi XE2, together with an additional set of built-in compilers for non-Windows platforms. FireMonkey is a cross-platform framework for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux (x64). The GUI parts of FireMonkey are largely based on Direct3D and OpenGL. FireMonkey is not compatible with VCL; they are two separate frameworks. FireMonkey applications do, however, allow easy sharing of non-visual code units with VCL applications, enabling a lot of code to be ported or shared easily between the platforms.

===Interoperability===

Delphi and its C++ counterpart, C++Builder, are interoperable. They share many core components, notably the IDE, the VCL and FMX frameworks, and much of the runtime library. In addition, they can be used jointly in a project. For example, C++Builder 6 and later can combine source code from Delphi and C++ in one project, while packages compiled with C++Builder can be used from within Delphi. In 2007, the products were released jointly as RAD Studio, a shared host for Delphi and C++Builder, which can be purchased with either or both.
Starting with Rio, there is also interoperability with Python.

=== Sample &quot;Hello World&quot; program ===

program ObjectPascalExample;

type
 THelloWorld = class
 procedure Put;
 end;

procedure THelloWorld.Put;
begin
 Writeln(&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;);
end;

var
 HelloWorld: THelloWorld; { this is an implicit pointer }

begin
 HelloWorld := THelloWorld.Create; { constructor returns a pointer to an object of type THelloWorld }
 HelloWorld.Put;
 HelloWorld.Free; { this line deallocates the THelloWorld object pointed to by HelloWorld }
end.
Note that the object construct is still available in Delphi.

==History==
== Uses in schools ==
Delphi is the medium used to teach programming in South African schools as a subject of information technology (IT).

==Roadmaps==
Embarcadero used to publish &quot;roadmaps&quot; describing their future development plans. The last one was published in November 2020. Version 10.5 referred to in the November 2020 roadmap was renamed 11.0.
Starting with Delphi 11, Embarcadero decided to no longer publish formal roadmaps. Instead, possible new features are now presented in a loose order through blog entries and online webinars. An important role has Marco Cantú (product manager) with his blog.

==Related software==
* Borland Enterprise Studio, a precursor to RAD Studio, is a software development suite that includes support for multiple languages. Borland Enterprise Studio for Windows supports Delphi.
* Borland Kylix: Similar to Delphi, but for Linux, released in 2001. This was the first attempt to add Linux support to the Delphi product family. Kylix used the new CLX cross-platform framework (based on Qt), instead of Delphi&#x27;s VCL. Kylix was discontinued after version 3. Today Linux support is integrated into the main Delphi product and uses the FireMonkey cross-platform framework.
* InterBase is an embeddable SQL database that integrates natively to Delphi and C++Builder for client/server or embedded development. Its distinguishing features reduced administration requirements, commercial-grade data security, disaster recovery, and change synchronization. It is also accessible by all major languages and platforms in the market with database connection protocols like ODBC, ADO, ADO.NET and even with Java by JDBC/ODBC Bridge or Java type 4 connectors.
* JBuilder was a tool for Java development based on Eclipse since version JBuilder 2007.
* RadPHP (later replaced with HTML5 Builder) was an IDE for PHP that provided true RAD functionality. It has a form designer similar to that of Delphi or Visual Basic, and an integrated debugger based on the Apache web server. It also includes a VCL library ported to PHP. Unlike other IDEs, it supports Web 2.0 features such as Ajax. Delphi for PHP was announced on March 20, 2007, renamed in October 2010 to RadPHP, and is based on Qadram Q studio. Embarcadero acquired Qadram in January 2011.
* Delphi Prism (later renamed Embarcadero Prism) derived from the Oxygene language (formerly named Chrome) from RemObjects. It ran in the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE rather than RAD Studio. It was licensed and rebranded by Embarcadero to replace Delphi.NET when that product was discontinued.
* Free Pascal is an open-source Pascal cross-platform cross-compiler that supports most of Delphi&#x27;s Object Pascal code. Free Pascal also has its own language extensions, multiple compiler [language syntax] modes, and supports 18+ operating systems and 9+ processor architectures. Lazarus is a cross-platform RAD IDE that uses the Free Pascal compiler.

===Notable third-party libraries===
* FastCode – Enhanced runtime libraries and memory manager.
* OpenWire (library) – Data flow, events, and state synchronization component library.
* Teechart – Charting library.

<text>Gustav Schwarzenegger (17August 190713December 1972) was an Austrian police chief (), postal inspector, member of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), and military police officer. He was the father of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

==Biography==
Gustav Schwarzenegger was born in Austria-Hungary, the son of Cecelia (née , 1878–1968) and Karl Schwarzenegger (1872–1927). His paternal grandfather, Wenzel Mach, was Czech and came from the village of Chocov near Mladá Vožice. Wenzel had a child out of wedlock with Kunigunde Schwarzenegger, and the child was originally named Carl Mach but later adopted his mother&#x27;s surname, Schwarzenegger.

==Nazi Party and SA membership==
According to documents obtained in 2003 from the Austrian State Archives by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Schwarzenegger applied to join the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazi Party&#x27;s (NSDAP) paramilitary wing, on 1March 1939. Austria became part of Nazi Germany after being annexed on 12March 1938. A separate record obtained by the Wiesenthal Center indicates he sought membership before the annexation, but was accepted only in January 1941.

Schwarzenegger also applied to become a member of the SA on 1May 1939, a year after the annexation of Austria, at a time when SA membership was declining. The SA had 900,000 members in 1940, down from 4.2million in 1934. This six-year decline in SA membership was an extended result of the three-day-long purge known as the Night of the Long Knives, a political purge carried out by Adolf Hitler against the SA, seen at that time as too radical and too powerful by senior military and industrial leaders within the NSDAP.

==Military career==
Schwarzenegger had served in the Austrian Army from 1930 to 1937, achieving the rank of section commander and, in 1937, he became a police officer. After enlisting in the in November 1939, Schwarzenegger, according to his &quot;Soldbuch&quot;, had gained the rank of (sergeant major) of the , which acted as military police units. He served in Poland, France, Belgium, Ukraine, Lithuania and The Soviet Union. His unit was 521 (mot.), part of Panzer Group 4.

Wounded in action in Leningrad, Russia, on 22 August 1942, Schwarzenegger was awarded the Iron Cross First and Second Classes for bravery, the Eastern Front Medal, and the Wound Badge; he also received significant medical attention for his injuries. Initially treated at a military hospital in , according to the records, Schwarzenegger also suffered recurring bouts of malaria, which led to his discharge in February 1944. Considered unfit for active duty, he returned to Graz, Austria, where he was assigned to work as a postal inspector.

A health registry document describes him as a &quot;calm and reliable person, not particularly outstanding&quot; and assesses his intellect as &quot;average.&quot; Ursula Schwarz, a historian at Vienna&#x27;s Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance, has argued that Schwarzenegger&#x27;s career was fairly typical for his generation, and that no evidence has emerged directly linking him with participation in war crimes or abuses against civilians. He resumed his police career in 1947.

==Later life and death==
Schwarzenegger married war widow Aurelia &quot;Reli&quot; Jadrny (29 July 19222 August 1998) on 5 October 1945, in , Austria. They later had two sons, and Arnold; died on 20 May 1971 in a car accident while driving alone drunk on a mountain road.

Schwarzenegger died of a stroke on 13 December 1972, at the age of 65, in Austria, where he had been transferred as a policeman. While visiting Cemetery in August 1998, where her husband was buried, Aurelia Jadrny Schwarzenegger died of a heart attack at the age of 76; she is buried next to him. Their son, Arnold, stated in the film &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; that he did not attend his father&#x27;s funeral, but the film&#x27;s director, George Butler, later said that it was a story Arnold had appropriated from a boxer, to make it appear as though he could prevent his personal life from interfering with his athletic training.

News reports about Schwarzenegger&#x27;s Nazi links first surfaced in 1990, at which time Arnold Schwarzenegger asked the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an organization he had long supported, to research his father&#x27;s past. The Center found his father&#x27;s army records and NSDAP party membership, but did not uncover any connection to war crimes or the paramilitary organization, the (SS). Media interest resurfaced when Arnold ran for Governor of California in the state&#x27;s 2003 recall election.

In a 2021 video made in response to the United States Capitol attack, his son Arnold publicly recalled, for the first time, how Gustav was frequently drunk and abusive to his family when Arnold was young. He attributed this behavior to guilt and shame over what Gustav and other Nazis and collaborators had perpetrated or enabled during the war. His son brought up the war&#x27;s impact on Gustav again in a 2022 video about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in which he urged the Russian soldiers to discontinue their invasion in order not to &quot;be broken like [his] father&quot;.
