<text>The Rossano Gospels, designated by 042 or Σ (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 18 (Soden), held at the cathedral of Rossano in Italy, is a 6th-century illuminated manuscript Gospel Book written following the reconquest of the Italian peninsula by the Byzantine Empire. Also known as Codex purpureus Rossanensis due to the reddish-purple (&quot;purpureus&quot; in Latin) appearance of its pages, the codex is one of the oldest surviving illuminated manuscripts of the New Testament. The manuscript is famous for its prefatory cycle of miniatures of subjects from the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, arranged in two tiers on the page, sometimes with small Old Testament prophet portraits below, prefiguring and pointing up to events described in the New Testament scene above.

== History ==
The manuscript is dated by the INTF to the 6th century.

The codex was discovered in 1879 in the sacristy of Rossano Cathedral by Oskar von Gebhardt and Adolf Harnack.

On 9 October 2015 in Abu Dhabi, the international UNESCO Committee, inscribed the Codex Purpureus Rossanensis in its register of the memory of the world.

=== Origin ===
Discovered in 1846 in Rossano Cathedral, the Rossano Gospels is the oldest extant illuminated manuscript of the New Testament Gospels. The exact time and place of its creation are still uncertain.

The manuscript is dated by the INTF to the sixth century. The Gospels were written after the Ostrogoths of the Byzantine Empire recaptured the Italian peninsula after the war (from 535 to 553).

=== Rediscovery ===
The codex was discovered in 1879 in the sacristy of Rossano Cathedral by Oskar von Gebhardt and Adolf Harnack.

On October 9, 2015, in Abu Dhabi, the international UNESCO Committee inscribed the Codex Purpureus Rossanensis in its register of the memory of the world.

The Rossano Gospels presents its text in a liturgical order like some other restored manuscripts. Chapters in this manuscript are arranged according to the church year. In this particular case, the readings followed the Lenten seasonal order, telling the story of Jesus&#x27; last few weeks on earth and about his death.

Although it is no longer used in Christian ceremonies, this particular Gospels are important for dissecting art and symbolism, and researching the pages sheds light on early Christian beliefs.

== Description ==

=== Contents ===
Presenting nearly all of its miniatures in an architecture-like setting, the Rossano Gospels is one of the few illuminated manuscripts that perfectly fits with its definitions. It helps the reader take a spiritual insight into history, politics, religion, and people, and using bright colors on purple vellum with gold and silver lettering, and brightly-painted illustrations. Due to the lavish materials and high quality of the illumination, Byzantine art historians, such as Kathleen Maxwell, have posited that it was created in an imperial scriptorium in Constantinople.

In the sixth century, gospel books had two main types of presentation, Biblical order and liturgical order. Liturgical order means that the readings were arranged according to the church calendar, which begins at Advent and ends with Pentecost. The illustrations of the Rossano Gospels are separate from the text of the Gospels and are arranged according to the liturgical calendar during the season of Lent.

The now incomplete codex contains the text of the Gospels of Matthew and the majority of the Gospels of Mark with only one lacuna, Mark 16:14-20. It is thought that there was a companion second volume, which is apparently lost. It contains the Epistula ad Carpianum, tables of the (&quot;tables of contents&quot;) before each Gospel, (&quot;titles&quot;) at the top of the pages, numbers of Ammonian Sections, and references to the Eusebian Canons.

The text of the Codex agrees generally with the Byzantine text-type in close relationship to the Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus. The Rossano Gospels, along with the manuscripts N, O, and Φ, belong to the group of the Purple Uncials (or purple codices). Aland placed all four manuscripts of the group (the Purple Uncials) in Category V.

In Matthew 1:11 it has the additional reading τον Ιωακιμ, Ιωακιμ δε εγεννησεν (&quot;Joakim, Joakim begot&quot;) — M U Θ &quot;f&quot;1 33 258 478 661 954 1216 1230 1354 1604 Lectionary 54 syrh geo.

In Matthew 23:25 it reads ακαθαρσιας for ακρασιας, a reading supported by Old Latin, the Syriac Sinaiticus manuscript, and Coptic version.

=== Materials ===

The Rossano Gospels is one of the oldest illuminated manuscript to be penned in silver ink on purple dyed parchment with colors hues chosen from dark purple to reddish brown. The Vienna Genesis and the Sinope Gospels are also written in silver ink on purple-dyed parchment. In the Middle Ages, purple was believed to be a symbol of royalty or holiness, and because Christianity considered Jesus Christ to be the embodiment of God, he is worthy of the rare purple dye.

Rossano Gospel&#x27;s paper are vellum parchment, made from the skin of a calf; the thinner parchment is, the higher its value.

The large ( by ) book has text written in a square block with two columns of twenty lines each. The prefatory cycle of illustrations is also on purple dyed parchment.

Rossano Codex is fully gilded on valuable vellum surface which makes the value of the manuscript unique and precious. In Medieval times, writing mixed with gold or silver had spiritual connotations, reflecting the presence of God.

=== Decoration ===
In the &quot;Christ before Pilate&quot; illumination, the trial of Christ before Pilate is shown, where Pontius Pilate is sitting on a chair surrounded by people. There is a halo-like shape drawn over the whole scene, and the people are arranged in a semi-circle. Below that, separated by a ground line, are Jesus and several other figures that are supposed to be standing in front of Pilate. If someone were to draw a line around the whole image, it would form the shape of an arch. A model of an apse shows how easily the miniature could fit into the shape, and how likely it was that it is a direct copy of the apse of some structure. In many of the images, the eyes of the crowd figures are not quite focused on the subject on the drawing, suggesting that they held another position when they were first drawn. Christ stands in a subordinate position, lower and to one side. Pilate&#x27;s commanding position distinguishes these miniatures from almost all other versions of the trial in early Christian and medieval art. Another distinctive mark of these miniatures is the moment selected for the representation. In the first scene, this is the beginning of the trial when Christ is led to Pilate by the high priests, one of whom supports the charges. The second scene represents the choice between Christ and Barabbas offered by Pilate to the Jews. These two scenes show that the formal opening of the trial and the central moment of it when the critical issue was posed. Almost all other representations are content to present the famous hand-washing scene, the last act of the trial, in which Pilate disclaimed responsibility for the decision taken. In the Rossano Gospel&#x27;s Trial of Christ, there are three acts and three interludes. The inscription on the rector at the top (Matt 27:2) announced the opening of trial in which Christ&#x27;s silence and refusal to answer charges is the focal point, interpolated with the fate of Judas (27:3-5). The second event of the trial, the choice between Christ and Barabbas (Luke 23:18 or Matt 27:21), has an interluding scene featuring Herod (Luke 23:6-12). The third act of trial is the Washing of Pilate&#x27;s Hands (Matt 27:23-25) with the interlude of the Message of Pilate&#x27;s Wife (Matt.27:19).

In the illustration of Saint Mark writing the Gospels, there are two figures; Saint Mark is seated in a throne-like chair with his muse, Mary, as Divine wisdom. There is definitely a sense of space within. The robes of the two figures are also lined with complexity with many strokes of the pen showing the folds of cloth. Thus, it is surprising that the surrounding architecture, which consists of two columns and what appears to be an apse or other such archway, is devoid of all but the simplest details. Even the top of the arch with its seashell-like pattern is rigid and sharp, which further proves the theory that the miniatures on the pages of this Gospels were derived from existing structures. 

Other significant images include Jesus giving the last supper to his disciples and of Jesus washing Peter&#x27;s feet. Jesus and the disciple on the right end of the table are reclining; they are twisted in a way that is not proportional according to the strange dual perspective. The floor actually seems to be part of the table at first glance, as there is no distinction between where the table ends and the floor begins. The floor, too, is miraculously upended, and upon it are drawings of pheasants or peacocks. The disciples that gather around the semi-circular table form an arch. Perhaps an original of this piece was once situated in such a way. Eyes of the disciples are slightly unfocused as they look at Jesus, suggesting that their forms may have been situated along the structure of an apse&#x27;s shell-like shape.

<doc id="346790" wikidata="Q1520826" url="?curid=346790" title="Tiger Force">
<text>Tiger Force was the name of a long-range reconnaissance patrol (LRRP) unit of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry, 1st Brigade (Separate), 101st Airborne Division, which fought in the Vietnam War from November 1965 to November 1967. The unit gained notoriety after investigations during the course of the war and decades afterwards revealed extensive war crimes against civilians, which numbered into the hundreds.

==Composition==

The platoon-sized unit, approximately 45 paratroopers, was organized by Major David Hackworth in November 1965 to &quot;outguerrilla the guerrillas&quot;. Tiger Force (Recon) 1-327th was a highly decorated small unit in Vietnam, and paid for its reputation with heavy casualties. In October 1968, Tiger Force&#x27;s parent battalion was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which included a mention of Tiger Force&#x27;s service at Đắk Tô in June 1966.

==Investigations of war crimes==

On October 19, 2003, Michael D. Sallah, a reporter for The Toledo Blade newspaper, obtained unreleased, confidential records of U.S. Army commander Henry Tufts. One file in these records referred to a previously unpublished war crimes investigation known as the Coy Allegation. To investigate this further, Sallah gained access to a large collection of documents produced by the investigation held at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland.

Sallah found that between 1971 and 1975, the Army&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Command had investigated the Tiger Force unit for alleged war crimes committed between May and November 1967. The documents included sworn statements from many Tiger Force veterans, which detailed war crimes allegedly committed by Tiger Force members during the Song Ve Valley and Operation Wheeler military campaigns. The statements, from both individuals who allegedly participated in the war crimes and those that did not, described war crimes such as the following:

* the routine torture and execution of prisoners
* the routine practice of intentionally killing unarmed Vietnamese villagers including men, women, children, and elderly people
* the routine practice of cutting off and collecting the ears of victims
* the practice of wearing necklaces composed of human ears
* the practice of cutting off and collecting the scalps of victims
* incidents where soldiers planted weapons on murdered Vietnamese villagers
* an incident where a young mother was drugged, raped, and then executed
* an incident where a soldier killed a baby and cut off the baby&#x27;s head after the baby&#x27;s mother was killed

The investigators concluded that many of the war crimes took place. This included the murder of former ARVN personnel, the murder of two blind brothers, and the routine murder of women, children, and disabled or elderly civilians. Despite these conclusions, the Army decided not to pursue any prosecutions.

Their high bodycounts were recognized and encouraged by military officials. Colonel Morse ordered troops to rack up a body count of 327 casualties in order to match the battalion&#x27;s infantry designation, 327th. By the end of the campaign, the soldiers were congratulated for their 1000th total kill. Those killed were listed as enemy combatants.

After studying the documents, Sallah and fellow reporter, Mitch Weiss, located and interviewed dozens of veterans who served in Tiger Force during the period in question as well as the CID investigators who later carried out the Army&#x27;s inquiry. The reporters also traveled to Vietnam and tracked down numerous residents of Song Ve Valley who identified themselves as witnesses. Sallah and Weiss reported that the war crimes were corroborated by both veterans and Song Ve Valley residents. The reporters also managed to track down dozens of additional investigative records not included in the National Archives.

The reporters published their findings in a series of articles in &quot;The Toledo Blade&quot; in October 2003. &quot;The New York Times&quot; subsequently performed their own investigation, contacting a few Tiger Force veterans and corroborating &quot;The Toledo Blade&quot;″s findings.

Since &quot;The Blade&quot;s story, the United States Army has opened a review of the former Tiger Force investigation, but has not yet provided much additional information. On May 11, 2004, Lt. Col. Pamela Hart informed &quot;The Blade&quot; reporters that she had been too busy responding to prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers in Iraq to check on the status of the Tiger Force case. &quot;The Blade&quot; has not reported on any more recent updates from the U.S. Army.

Reporters Michael D. Sallah, Mitch Weiss, and Joe Mahr received a number of awards for their series:

* In 2003, the reporters won the IRE Medal.
* In 2003, the reporters won the Sigma Delta Chi Award for investigative reporting, for publications with a circulation of 100,000 or greater.
* In 2004, the reporters won the Taylor Family Award for Fairness in Newspapers.
* In 2004, the reporters won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting.

In 2006, Sallah, now an investigative reporter with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and Weiss, an investigative reporter with the Associated Press, co-authored a book chronicling their findings: &quot;Tiger Force: A True Story of Men and War&quot; (2006).

<text>Josephus Hamilton Stevenot (December 23, 1888 – June 8, 1943) was an American entrepreneur and U.S. Army officer in the Philippines with many accomplishments, but today mostly remembered in the Boy Scouts of the Philippines as a co-founder.

==Background and career==
Josephus Emile Hamilton &quot;Joe&quot; Stevenot was born in Melones, California to Emile Knoepffler Stevenot (1846–1906) and Sarah Elisabeth Hamilton Stephens Stevenot (1855–1928). Emile Knoepffler Stevenot was born in Alsace-Lorraine, trained as a mining engineer, and migrated to the USA to join his father Jean Dieudonne Gabriel Knoepffler Stevenot (1813–1885), a California miner.

Joe had eight siblings. Joe and his three brothers, Fred, Archibald, and Casimir, were involved in various enterprises, and set up their Stevenot Corporation which had mining interests in California and the Philippines. Casimir also founded the California Philippine Corporation for import and export. Joe based himself in the Philippines to attend to their business concerns in the islands.

Josephus Stevenot served as Director of the Philippine Trust Company, President and General Manager of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), Director of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), Director of Philippine Milling Company, Director of Philippine Realty Corporation, and Director of Fidelity &amp; Surety Company.

At the same time, Stevenot was involved in military matters as a major in the active reserves. An Army pilot, he was appointed to the command of the aviation unit of the Philippine National Guard (which had been planned to be involved in World War I but never saw action). Stevenot recruited his flying instructor Alfred John Croft (1887–1970), and together they established the Curtiss School of Aviation (called the Curtiss Flying School, after the original Curtiss Flying School) in Camp Claudio, Parañaque, Rizal, where they trained the first 25 Filipino pilots. They subsequently organised an air show by their students, held on 21 June 1921.

In June 1941, in Washington DC with Secretary of War Henry Lewis Stimson, Stevenot urged closer cooperation between Philippine Army Field Marshall Douglas MacArthur and U.S. Army Philippine Department Commander Maj. Gen. George Grunert.

As portents of war became more pronounced, Stevenot became more active in intelligence work. It was while working for Allied intelligence in the South West Pacific Area in World War II that Col. Stevenot died in a plane crash in Vanuatu. After an initial burial, his remains were later transferred to La Loma Cemetery, allegedly by request of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines.

==Scouting involvement==

Stevenot&#x27;s involvement in Scouting in the Philippines started with the Boy Scouts of America Philippine Islands Council No. 545, as Chairman of the Finance Committee. The Council was financially unstable and he was invited by West Pointer Gen. Vicente Lim, a Boy Scouting supporter. The Council improved considerably under Stevenot&#x27;s guidance, and in 1934 he was elected the last President of the BSA Philippine Islands Council No. 545.

With the imminent granting of independence to the Philippines by the United States in 1946, Stevenot worked for the establishment of a Philippine Boy Scout organization. &quot;Almost single-handed, President Stevenot worked for the gradual grant of autonomy to our Boy Scout Organization...&quot; (— &quot;Scouting for Filipino Boys&quot;, page 11). He performed the paper work, obtained the support of six prominent national personalities to lend their names as incorporators, and lobbied the Philippine National Assembly for a legal charter, imitating the Congressional charter obtained by the Boy Scouts of America from the United States Congress. His efforts resulted in a legislative bill sponsored by Assemblyman Tomás Valenzuela Confesór (1891–1951) and signed into law as Commonwealth Act 111 by Pres. Manuel L. Quezon on October 31, 1936. As founder of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, Stevenot became both the first President (the corporate head of the organization) and the first Chief Scout (patterned after Baron Baden-Powell of Gilwell and Ernest Thompson Seton, to act as the focus of the youth&#x27;s inspiration which had fueled the entire Scout Movement globally).

In 1937, in his letter &quot;To the People of the Philippine Islands,&quot; dated October 28, 1937, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. commended Stevenot: &quot;In Major Stevenot you have an exceptionally able and public spirited man.&quot;

In 1939, Stevenot supported the establishment of a Girl Scout organization by sending Josefa Llanes Escoda to the United States and Britain for training. Upon Escoda&#x27;s return to the Philippines, he assisted her in setting up the Girl Scouts of the Philippines.

In 1941, by request of the BSP, the BSA recognized Stevenot&#x27;s service to youth with the award of the Silver Buffalo.

== Death ==
Stevenot died in 1943 at just 54. He was buried in New Caledonia but was later exhumed by the US Army and his friend fellow Boy Scouts of the Philippines charter member Don Gabriel Daza, and his remains were later buried with full Scouting honours at La Loma Cemetery in the Philippines. Forty years later, Stevenot&#x27;s wife passed in California and one of Stevenot&#x27;s daughters and Daza brought the ashes to the Philippines to be buried along with her husband.

<doc id="346809" wikidata="Q844270" url="?curid=346809" title="Ragweed">
<text>Ragweeds are flowering plants in the genus Ambrosia in the aster family, Asteraceae. They are distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, especially North America, where the origin and center of diversity of the genus are in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Several species have been introduced to the Old World and some have naturalized and have become invasive species. In Europe, this spread is expected to continue, due to ongoing climate change.

The name &quot;ragweed&quot; is derived from &quot;ragged&quot; + &quot;weed,&quot; coming from the ragged appearance of the plant&#x27;s leaves. Other common names include bursages and burrobrushes. The genus name is from the Greek &quot;ambrosia&quot;, meaning &quot;food or drink of immortality&quot;.

Ragweed pollen is notorious for causing allergic reactions in humans, specifically allergic rhinitis. Up to half of all cases of pollen-related allergic rhinitis in North America are caused by ragweeds.

The most widespread species of the genus in North America is &quot;Ambrosia artemisiifolia&quot;.

==Description and ecology==
Ragweeds are annual and perennial herbs and shrubs. Species may grow just a few centimeters tall or exceed four meters in height. The stems are erect, decumbent or prostrate, and many grow from rhizomes. The leaves may be arranged alternately, oppositely, or both. The leaf blades come in many shapes, sometimes divided pinnately or palmately into lobes. The edges are smooth or toothed. Some are hairy, and most are glandular.

Ragweeds are monoecious, most producing inflorescences that contain both staminate and pistillate flowers. Inflorescences are often in the form of a spike or raceme made up mostly of staminate flowers with some pistillate clusters around the base. Staminate flower heads have stamens surrounded by whitish or purplish florets. Pistillate flower heads have fruit-yielding ovules surrounded by many phyllaries and fewer, smaller florets. The pistillate flowers are wind pollinated, and the fruits develop. They are burs, sometimes adorned with knobs, wings, or spines.

Many &quot;Ambrosia&quot; species occur in desert and semi-desert areas, and many are ruderal species that grow in disturbed habitat types.

==Allergy==

Ragweed pollen is a common allergen. A single plant may produce about a billion grains of pollen per season, and the pollen is transported on the wind. It causes about half of all cases of pollen-associated allergic rhinitis in North America, where ragweeds are most abundant and diverse. Common culprits are common ragweed (&quot;A. artemisiifolia&quot;) and great ragweed (&quot;A. trifida&quot;).

Concentration of ragweed pollen—in the absence of significant rainfall, which removes pollen from the air- is the lowest in the early morning hours (6:00 AM), when emissions starts. Pollen concentration peaks at midday. Ragweed pollen can remain airborne for days and travel great distances, and can even be carried out to sea. Ragweeds native to the Americas have been introduced to Europe starting in the nineteenth century and especially during World War I, and have spread rapidly since the 1950s. Eastern Europe, particularly Hungary, has been badly affected by ragweed since the early 1990s, when the dismantling of Communist collective agriculture led to large-scale abandonment of agricultural land, and new building projects also resulted in disturbed, un-landscaped areas.

The major allergenic compound in the pollen has been identified as &quot;Amb a 1&quot;, a 38 kDa nonglycosylated protein composed of two subunits. It also contains other allergenic components, such as profilin and calcium-binding proteins.

Ragweed allergy sufferers may show signs of oral allergy syndrome, a food allergy classified by a cluster of allergic reactions in the mouth in response to the consumption of certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Foods commonly involved include beans, celery, cumin, hazelnuts, kiwifruit, parsley, potatoes, bananas, melons, cucumbers, and zucchini. Because cooking usually denatures the proteins that cause the reaction, the foods are more allergenic when eaten raw; exceptions are celery and nuts, which may not be safe even when cooked. Signs of reaction can include itching, burning, and swelling of the mouth and throat, runny eyes and nose, hives, and, less commonly, vomiting, diarrhea, asthma, and anaphylaxis. These symptoms are due to the abnormal increase of IgE antibodies which attach to a type of immune cell called mast cells. When the ragweed antigen then attaches to these antibodies the mast cells release histamine and other symptom-evoking chemicals.

Merck &amp; Co, under license from allergy immunotherapy (AIT) company ALK, has launched a ragweed allergy immunotherapy treatment in sublingual tablet form in the US and Canada. 

As of 2006, research into allergy immunotherapy treatment involved administering doses of the allergen to accustom the body to induce specific long-term tolerance.

==Control and eradication==
Where herbicides cannot be used, mowing may be repeated about every three weeks, as it grows back rapidly. In the past, ragweed was usually cut down, left to dry, and then burned. This method is used less often now, because of the pollution caused by smoke. Manually uprooting ragweed is generally ineffective, and skin contact can cause allergic reaction. If uprooting is the method of choice, it should be performed before flowering. There is evidence that mechanical and chemical control methods are actually no more effective in the long run than leaving the weed in place.

Fungal rusts and the leaf-eating beetle &quot;Ophraella communa&quot; have been proposed as agents of biological pest control of ragweeds, but the latter may also attack sunflowers, and applications for permits and funding to test these controls have been unsuccessful. The beetle has, however, appeared in Europe, either on its own or as an uncontrolled introduction, and it has started making a dent into
Ambrosia populations there.

<doc id="346814" wikidata="Q416940" url="?curid=346814" title="Tetrahydrogestrinone">
<text>Tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), known by the nickname The Clear, is a synthetic and orally active anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) which was never marketed for medical use. It was developed by Patrick Arnold and was used by a number of high-profile athletes such as Barry Bonds and Dwain Chambers.

==Non-medical uses==
THG was developed completely in secret by Patrick Arnold as a designer drug, on the basis that doping testers would be unlikely to detect a totally new compound. Arnold developed a chemical similar to two obscure steroids marketed by BALCO, norbolethone and desoxymethyltestosterone, which had been reported in scientific literature but never entered mass production, and the banned anabolic steroids trenbolone and gestrinone, the latter of which was used to synthesize it.

In 2003, whistleblower Trevor Graham passed a spent syringe containing a small amount of the drug to the United States Anti-Doping Agency. This was then transferred to the research group of pharmacologist Don Catlin, who identified the drug using mass spectrometry techniques and gave it its present name.

THG has never been fully tested for safety and has never entered legitimate medical use, although some studies have been made of its properties. A synthesis was devised to ensure a source of material for comparison and it was scheduled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005. Concerns have also been raised about its potential use in animals such as in horse-racing.

==Side effects==
Side effects from prolonged use are likely to include infertility in both men and women, as well as other steroid side effects such as acne and hirsutism. Unlike most other anabolic steroids, THG also binds with high affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor, and while this effect may cause additional weight loss, it is also likely to cause additional side effects such as immunosuppression that are not seen with most other steroids.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
THG is a highly potent agonist of the androgen and progesterone receptors, around 10 times more potent than the comparison drugs nandrolone or trenbolone, but with no estrogenic activity. It has been found to bind to the androgen receptor with similar affinity to dihydrotestosterone and produces growth of muscle tissue. According to Patrick Arnold, due to the drug&#x27;s potency, he never had to supply significant quantities to BALCO, because &quot;just a couple of drops under the tongue&quot; were a sufficient dose.

When THG reaches the nucleus of a cell, it binds to the androgen receptor at the ligand-binding pocket. Here it changes the expression of a variety of genes, turning on several anabolic and androgenic functions. It is the ligand&#x27;s structure which determines the number of interactions that can take place with the human androgen receptor ligand-binding domain. Even minor modifications in the ligand&#x27;s structure have a great impact on the strength of the interactions this ligand has with the androgen receptor. THG, possessing a high affinity, establishes more van der Waals contacts with the receptor than with many other steroids. It is this higher affinity and specific geometry of THG which makes these interactions with the androgen receptor so strong, resulting in THG&#x27;s potency.

==Chemistry==
THG, also known as 17α-ethyl-18-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethyl-18-methylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a 17α-alkylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). It is a modification of gestrinone (17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone) in which the ethynyl group has been hydrogenated into an ethyl group, thereby converting the steroid from a norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with weak AR activity into a norethandrolone (17α-ethyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with powerful AR activity. THG is closely related to RU-2309 (the 17α-methyl variant), trenbolone (δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), metribolone (17α-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), and norboletone (17α-ethyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone).

==History==
For a time, THG was considered the drug of choice for safe and &quot;invisible&quot; world record breaking in athletics, being used by several high-profile gold medal winners such as the sprinter Marion Jones, who resigned from her athletic career in 2007 after admitting to using THG prior to the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where she had won three gold medals. It has also been used by formerly banned British athlete Dwain Chambers, Major League Baseball left fielder Barry Bonds, and Major League Baseball first baseman Jason Giambi.

THG was developed by Patrick Arnold for the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), which claimed to be a nutritional supplement company. The company manufactured the drug through palladium-charcoal catalyzed hydrogenation from gestrinone, a substance used in gynecology for treatment of endometriosis (Australian Medicines handbook 2011).

In 2003, U.S. sprint coach Trevor Graham delivered a syringe containing traces of THG to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). This helped Don Catlin, MD, the founder and then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Lab, to identify and develop a test for THG, the second reported designer anabolic steroid.

<text>The Scoliidae, the scoliid wasps, are a family of wasps comprising about 560 species worldwide. They tend to be black, often marked with yellow or orange, and their wing tips are distinctively corrugated. Males are more slender and elongated than females, with significantly longer antennae, but the sexual dimorphism is not as apparent as in many of the Tiphiidae and Thynnidae.

== Biology ==
Scoliid wasps are solitary parasitoids of scarab beetle larvae. Female scoliids burrow into the ground in search of these larvae and then use their sting to paralyze them. They sometimes excavate a chamber and move the paralyzed beetle larva into it before depositing an egg. Scoliid wasps act as important biocontrol agents, as many of the beetles they parasitize are pests, including the Japanese beetle. Male scoliids patrol territories, ready to mate with females emerging from the ground. Adult wasps may be minor pollinators of some plants and can be found on many wildflowers in the late summer. 

Scoliidae has at least one species known to engage in pseudocopulation with an orchid. Flowers of the orchid &quot;Bipinnula penicillata&quot; in subtropical South America resemble females of &quot;Pygodasis bistrimaculata&quot;, tricking male wasps into attempting to mate and, in the process, provide pollination. Scoliids include some of the largest wasps in the world, such as &quot;Megascolia procer.&quot;

In 1847 and 1849 Eduard Eversmann published his &quot;Fauna Hymenopterologica Volgo-Uralensis—exhibiting the species of Hymenoptera which he observed and described in the provinces situated between the Volga river and the Ural mountains.&quot; He placed the Scoliadae as a subfamily of the Sphegidae He mentions the genus &quot;Scolia&quot; with 13 species, the genus &quot;Tiphia&quot; with 3 species, and the genus &quot;Meria&quot; , with only the species &quot;Meria sexpunctata&quot;.

==North American species list==
There are 36 species of Scoliidae reported to occur in North America. Two additional species, &quot;Campsomeriella annulata&quot; and &quot;Micromeriella marginella&quot; , were introduced to the United States but failed to become established.

<doc id="346821" wikidata="Q283485" url="?curid=346821" title="Carbohydrate loading">
<text>Carbohydrate loading, commonly referred to as carb-loading, or carbo-loading, is a strategy used by endurance athletes, such as marathoners and triathletes, to reduce fatigue during an endurance event by maximizing the storage of glycogen (or energy) in the muscles and liver. Carbohydrate consumption is increased in the days before an endurance event. 

Carbohydrate loading is generally recommended for endurance events lasting longer than 90 minutes. Foods with low glycemic indices are generally preferred for carbo-loading due to their minimal effect on serum glucose levels. Low glycemic foods commonly include vegetables, whole wheat pasta, and grains. Many endurance athletes have large pasta dinners the night before an event. Since muscles also use amino acids extensively when functioning within aerobic limits, meals should also include adequate protein. Large portions before a race can, however, decrease race-day performance if the digestive system has not had the time to process the food regimen.

==Without depletion==
Research in the 1980s led to a modified carbo-loading regimen that eliminates the depletion phase, instead calling for increased carbohydrate intake (to about 70% of total calories) and decreased training for three days before the event.

==Short workout==
A new carbo-loading regimen developed by scientists at the University of Western Australia calls for a normal diet with light training until the day before the race. On the day before the race, the athlete performs a very short, extremely high-intensity workout (such as a few minutes of sprinting) then consumes of carbohydrate per kilogram of lean mass over the next 24 hours. The regimen resulted in a 90% increase in glycogen storage when compared to before the carbo-load, which is comparable to or higher than the results achieved with other 2 day – 6 day carbo-loading regimes.

==Transient hypoglycemia==
Carbohydrate ingestion within 2 hours before aerobic exercise triggers elevated levels of insulin in the blood which may dramatically decrease serum glucose levels. This can limit aerobic performance, especially in events lasting longer than 60 minutes. This is known as transient or reactive hypoglycemia, and can be a limiting factor in elite athletes. Individuals susceptible to hypoglycemia are especially at risk for elevated insulin responses and thus will likely suffer from performance-limiting transient hypoglycemia if they do not follow the correct regimen.

==Diet composition==
The composition of carbohydrates in the athlete&#x27;s diet during carbohydrate loading is as important as their share of the overall caloric regimen .

Most dietary carbohydrates consist of varying proportions of two simple sugars, glucose and fructose. Fructose may be metabolized into liver glycogen, but it is ineffective at raising muscle glycogen levels (which is the objective of carbohydrate loading). Consequently, sources of high-fructose carbohydrates, such as fruit and sugar-based foods, are less than optimal for the task. The classic carb-loading meal is pasta, whose caloric content is primarily due to starch, a polymer of glucose. Other high-starch meals which include bread, rice, and potatoes are also part of the correct regimen.

<text>The Creaking Door was an old-time radio series of horror and suspense shows originating in South Africa. 

The Old Time Radio Researchers Group reports 42 extant episodes in MP3 circulation. The series was first aired in 1964-65. The stories are thrillers in the &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; vein, and generally thought of favorably by most fans of OTR.

It was sponsored by State Express 555 (pronounced &quot;State Express Three Fives&quot;) cigarettes, a British American Tobacco product.

<text>The Han-Zhao (; 304–329 AD), or Former Zhao (), was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Liu (Luandi/Chuge) clan of Xiongnu ethnicity during the Sixteen Kingdoms period of Chinese history. In Chinese historiography, it was given two conditional state titles, the Northern Han (; ) for the state proclaimed in 304 by Liu Yuan, and the Former Zhao (; ) for the state proclaimed in 319 by Liu Yao. The reference to them as separate states should be considered misleading, given that when Liu Yao changed the name of the state from “Han” to “Zhao” in 319, he treated the state as having been continuous from the time that Liu Yuan founded it in 304; instead, he de-established his imperial lineage from the Han dynasty and claimed ancestry directly from Modu Chanyu.

The reason it is also referred to as &quot;Former Zhao&quot; in historiography is to distinguish it from the similarly-named dynasty founded by Shi Le in 319, which was also known officially as &quot;Zhao&quot; (labeled &quot;Later Zhao&quot; in Chinese historiography). Since both the Former Zhao and Northern Han were ruled by the same family, the Chinese scholars often conditionally combined them into a single Han-Zhao regime. Numerous Western texts refer to the two states separately; others referred to the Han state as the “Northern Han”, a confusing nomenclature given that the term also refers to the Northern Han state of the later Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

During the Han period, the capital was frequently shifted around Shanxi before finally settling in Pingyang. The Han was a driving force during the upheaval of the Five Barbarians, as they brought the Disaster of Yongjia and demise of the Western Jin dynasty by 317. At the height of its power, the Han ruled Shanxi, Shaanxi, eastern Gansu, and large parts of Shandong, Hebei, and Henan. After Jin Zhun&#x27;s coup in 318, the empire, which renamed itself to (Former) Zhao in 319, was split into two between Liu Yao and the warlord, Shi Le. Liu Yao moved the capital to the west in Chang&#x27;an, retaining Shaanxi and eastern Gansu, while the eastern portion of the empire fell to Shi Le&#x27;s Later Zhao dynasty.

==History==

=== Five Divisions ===
Following the break-up of the Xiongnu Empire in the 1st century, the Southern Xiongnu branch surrendered to the Han dynasty and were resettled into the northern border commanderies. Under their chanyu, the Southern Xiongnu acted as a Han vassal state, providing assistance in defending the frontiers from nomadic forces. They settled down and fully took up agriculture, but kept a few aspects of their former nomadic lifestyle such as horse breeding. Relations with the Han were often times unstable as poor living conditions on the borders and the Chinese court meddling in their politics led to several rebellions. In 188, just as the Han was about to fall into political turmoil, the Southern Xiongnu also collapsed after dissenters within their ranks, allied with the rebelling Xiuchuge people, expelled their Han-backed chanyu and dissolved his government.

In 216, after the warlord, Cao Cao unified northern China, he had the exiled chanyu, Huchuquan detained as an honoured prisoner at Ye. He then reorganized what remained of the Southern Xiongnu into the Five Divisions (五部) around Taiyuan Commandery in Bing province. Each division was led by a commander, who were nobles from the tribes and were in turn supervised by a Chinese marshal. Huchuquan&#x27;s uncle, Qubei was also sent to oversee the Five Divisions, but after his death, his position was left vacant. No new chanyu was proclaimed after Huchuquan died, and the Five Divisions remained subservient to the Cao Wei dynasty. 

During the Jiaping era (249–254), the Five Divisions became a concern for the Chinese court as the Commander of the Left Division, Liu Bao unified them and was mobilizing a great army. The Wei and later the Western Jin intervened, gradually forcing them back into five. Five Divisions nobility had to send their children as hostages to the capital, Luoyang, including Liu Bao&#x27;s son, Liu Yuan. Sinicization was evident among the elites; Liu Yuan became proficient in the Confucianist classics and befriended members of the Chinese aristocracy such as the Wang clan of Taiyuan. He was even considered for the post of the Jin forces commander for the conquest of Eastern Wu but was later dismissed because of his ethnicity.

Nonetheless, among the Five Divisions, a sense of separate identity from the Chinese was retained. Discontent towards Jin rule and of their subordinate position prompted them to seek an independent or self-governing entity. As one of the elites, Liu Xuan, adequately puts it:After Liu Bao&#x27;s death, Liu Yuan returned to the Five Divisions and inherited his position. Liu Yuan&#x27;s lineage is debated by scholars. The traditional view states that he was the grandson of the penultimate chanyu, Yufuluo, and thus a direct descendant of the imperial Luandi clan. However, some modern historians have challenged this claim, pointing out discrepancies within the records. In fact, Liu Yuan and his family were referred to in several passages as Chuge, also known as the Xiuchuge people that overthrew the Southern Xiongnu chanyu in 188. These historians speculate that Liu Yuan had fabricated his lineage to the chanyu for legitimacy when he rebelled.

=== Han (304–319) ===
The Five Divisions and other non-affiliated &quot;hu&quot; tribes in Bing began staging revolts against Jin. Their close proximity to the Chinese heartland worried a few ministers within the court, who unsuccessfully pushed for their resettlement outside the frontiers. Developments in the War of the Eight Princes finally favored the Five Divisions, as infighting between the Jin princes over control of Emperor Hui led to civil wars and widespread famines in northern China. In 304, the Five Divisions elites contacted Liu Yuan, who was serving as a general under the Prince of Chengdu, Sima Ying at Ye, and offered him to become their rebellion&#x27;s leader. Liu Yuan agreed and took advantage of a commission from the desperate Sima Ying who was just being driven out of his base to gather 50,000 warriors. At Lishi, Liu Yuan declared himself the Grand Chanyu.

Later that year, Liu Yuan proclaimed himself the &quot;King of Han,&quot; the same first title used by Emperor Gaozu of Han. As a descendant of the chanyu, Liu Yuan also claimed descent from the Han dynasty, as the chanyus used to marry Han princesses through marriage alliances or heqin. By portraying his state as a restoration of the Han, Liu Yuan was able to establish his legitimacy and potentially win over support from the Han Chinese. Liu Yuan honored the emperors of Western, Eastern and Shu Han, and in 308, he elevated himself to Emperor of Han.

Anti-Jin sentiment grew as the civil wars continued, leading to more rebellions on the North China Plain. To bolster their numbers, Liu Yuan welcomed these rebels to join his ranks regardless of their ethnicity, such as the Chinese bandit, Wang Mi and the Jie former slave, Shi Le. To ensure their loyalty, they were given high ranks and full command over their armies, but this practice also meant that they were also essentially warlords as the Han court had no actual means to restrain them. In 308, the Han conquered Pingyang Commandery, where they shifted their capital to Puzi (蒲子, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) and then to Pingyang city (平陽, also in modern Linfen), pressuring the Jin as they brought themselves closer to Luoyang.

Liu Yuan died in 310 and was succeeded by his son Liu He. A week into his reign, He attempted to purge all his brothers before one of them, Liu Cong retaliated and killed him. After his offer to his half-brother, Liu Ai was rejected, Liu Cong took the throne for himself while still appointing Ai as his Crown Prince. He then intensified his attack on Luoyang, which had been left exposed by the departure of the Jin imperial army and a deadly famine. In 311, Shi Le annihilated the Jin imperial army at the Battle of Ningping, depriving Jin of its main force in the north. Han forces led by Wang Mi, Huyan Yan and Liu Yao then descended upon Luoyang, capturing the defenseless city and Emperor Huai in an event known as the Disaster of Yongjia.

Despite the symbolic victory, Jin forces continued to resist in northern China, with Emperor Min being installed at Chang&#x27;an in 312. More concerning was Shi Le gaining control of a significant part of the eastern empire after assassinating his fellow warlord, Wang Mi and absorbing his army. Liu Cong, fearing that Shi Le may outright rebel, did not punish him, while Wang Mi&#x27;s subordinate, Cao Ni continued to hold on to the Shandong region. In the west, Liu Cong heavily entrusted his cousin, Liu Yao, to lead the war against Emperor Min. After several years of campaigning, Liu Yao captured Chang&#x27;an in 316, ending the Western Jin dynasty. Both Emperor Huai and Min suffered similar fates; they were forced to serve as cupbearers for Liu Cong before they were executed out of fear they would rebel. After Emperor Min&#x27;s capture, the imperial Sima family reestablished itself as the Eastern Jin dynasty in 318 at Jiankang, south of the Yangtze river.

Within the Han court, Liu Cong also faced strong dissidence from his own ministers. Records depict him as a hedonistic ruler with a violent temperament, but restrained himself under pressure from his officials during his early reign. In his later reign, he had the unusual practice of having three empresses at a time, and he entrusted political affairs to his eunuchs and consort kins, which severely divided the court. He also began empowering his eldest son, Liu Can, threatening Liu Ai&#x27;s position as Crown Prince. This power struggle culminated in a brutal purge in 317 orchestrated by Liu Can and Liu Cong&#x27;s consort kins which saw Liu Ai and several prominent ministers executed.

After Liu Cong&#x27;s death in 318, his successor, Liu Can and the rest of the imperial family in Pingyang were massacred in a coup by a powerful consort kin, Jin Zhun. Jin Zhun declared himself Heavenly King of Han and invited the Eastern Jin court to assist him, but was ignored. Meanwhile, both Liu Yao and Shi Le combined their forces to oppose Jin Zhun. During the campaign, Liu Yao was acclaimed the new emperor by surviving Han officials fleeing from Pingyang. The rebellion was quickly defeated by the alliance, and Jin Zhun and his family were all killed.

=== Former Zhao (319–329) ===
With the rebellion crushed, tension arose between Liu Yao and Shi Le. As Shi Le had cultivated a powerful base on the North China Plain, Liu Yao was convinced that he would take advantage of Han&#x27;s vulnerability to launch a surprise rebellion. When Shi Le sent his envoy to congratulate him, Liu Yao had the envoy executed, which prompted Shi Le to declare independence. The empire was thus divided into two, with Liu Yao controlling the west and Shi Le controlling the east. As Pingyang had been devastated by the rebellion, Liu Yao shifted the capital to his base in Chang&#x27;an.

Unlike his predecessors, Liu Yao distanced the state away from the framing of Han restoration and appealed more to his Xiongnu ancestry. He renamed the state to Zhao (since one of Liu Yao&#x27;s previous title was Prince of Zhongshan, and Zhongshan was in the ancient state of Zhao), and honoured his ancestor, Modu Chanyu, but still saw his state as a continuation of Liu Yuan&#x27;s Han. Soon after, Shi Le also named his state Zhao, leading to historiographers to distinguish the two states as Former Zhao and Later Zhao.

In his early reign, Liu Yao expanded westwards while Shi Le dealt with his own matters in the east. In Longxi, he defeated the forces of Sima Bao, the last claimant to the Jin throne in the north, and later survived a major tribal rebellion by the Di and Qiang, leading to the relocation of nearly 200,000 of their people to Chang&#x27;an. Liu Yao then defeated Chen An, a warlord in Longxi who nominally submitted to Former Zhao, before going on to force the Former Liang into submission and invading Chouchi by 323. At its prime, the Former Zhao&#x27;s army reportedly numbered at around 285,000 strong. Despite the state&#x27;s new positioning, Liu Yao maintained interest in integrating with Chinese culture, as evident by his opening of an Imperial University in Chang&#x27;an taught by Confucian scholars.

War between the two Zhaos eventually broke out in 324, and in 328, Liu Yao led his forces to secure the Henan region from Later Zhao. Liu Yao and Shi Le&#x27;s forces came head to head at the Battle of Luoyang, and during the battle, Liu Yao, supposedly drunk, fell off his horse during a retreat and was captured by Later Zhao soldiers. He was then executed as his Crown Prince, Liu Xi, hastily succeeded him in Chang&#x27;an. In 329, Liu Xi was driven out of his capital and finally killed at Shanggui by Later Zhao forces. The Han-Zhao dynasty was at its end, and the Later Zhao would rule most of northern China for the next 20 years.

== Government ==
When Liu Yuan established the Han, he retained most of the imperial Chinese government offices such as Grand Marshal, Minister of Works and Minister Over the Masses while introducing a few Xiongnu-influenced offices, most notably the Grand Chanyu. The Grand Chanyu was second to the emperor, tasked with managing the non-Chinese tribes and was usually deferred to the heir apparent.

In 314, while reorganizing the government, Liu Cong introduced a dual administrative system between the Han Chinese and non-Chinese people that would later be adopted by some of the Sixteen Kingdoms. He created the offices of the Left and Right Director of Retainers to manage the 200,000 Chinese households along with the Left and Right Assistant Chanyu to govern the 100,000 tribes, who were collectively known as the &quot;Six Yi&quot; or &quot;Six Barbarians&quot; (六夷). Modern scholars have noted that the Xiongnu, specifically from the Five Divisions and Chuge branches, were not included in the &quot;Six Yi&quot;, and were instead administrated as part of the Han Chinese.

==Rulers of Han and Zhao==

Note: Liu Xi was Liu Yao&#x27;s crown prince who was thrust into the leadership role when Liu Yao was captured by Later Zhao&#x27;s emperor Shi Le, but he never took the imperial title.

<doc id="346828" wikidata="Q1345750" url="?curid=346828" title="Pallas's grasshopper warbler">
<text>Pallas&#x27;s grasshopper warbler (Helopsaltes certhiola), also known as the rusty-rumped warbler, is an Old World warbler in the grass warbler genus &quot;Helopsaltes&quot;. It breeds in the eastern Palearctic: from the Altai Mountains, Mongolia and Transbaikalia to northeastern China, the Korean Peninsula, and islands in the Sea of Okhotsk (Sakhalin and Kuril Islands). It is migratory, wintering from India eastward to Indonesia. It is a rare migrant in Sri Lanka.

==Etymology==
This bird was named after the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas. The specific &quot;certhiola&quot; is a diminutive from the genus &quot;Certhia&quot;, the treecreepers.

The sixth edition of &quot;Clements Checklist&quot; refers to this species as &quot;Pallas&#x27;s warbler&quot;, a name more commonly used for &quot;Phylloscopus proregulus.&quot;

==Habitat==
This small passerine bird is found in tall grass with some thicker vegetation, usually close to water in bogs or wet meadows. From 4 to 7 eggs are laid in a nest on the ground in grass. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. One of the best places to see this skulking species as a vagrant is Fair Isle, Shetland; for a species that only rarely appears in western Europe, it can be found there with some regularity.

==Description==

This is a medium-sized warbler. The adult has a streaked brown back, whitish grey underparts, unstreaked except on the undertail. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. It is very similar to the common grasshopper warbler, but is slightly larger, has white tips to the tail and tertial feathers, and a warmer brown rump. The white tips are the reason for its colloquial, mnemonic name of &quot;PG Tips&quot;.

This is a skulking species which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing. It creeps through grass and low foliage.

==Voice==
The song is not the mechanical insect-like reeling produced by the common grasshopper warbler and some other &quot;Locustella&quot; warblers, but an inventive &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;-like melody.

==Subspecies==
Five subspecies recognized:
*&quot;H. c. rubescens&quot; 
*&quot;H. c. sparsimstriatus&quot; 
*&quot;H. c. certhiola&quot; 
*&quot;H. c. centralasiae&quot; 
*&quot;H. c. minor&quot;

<doc id="346830" wikidata="Q1141471" url="?curid=346830" title="Northern Han">
<text>The Northern Han () was a dynastic state of China and one of the Ten Kingdoms during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was founded by Liu Min (Emperor Shizu) as a continuation of the Later Han dynasty founded by his brother Liu Zhiyuan (Emperor Gaozu). The Northern Han lasted from 951 to 979, when it was conquered by the Northern Song dynasty.

==Founding of the Northern Han==
The short-lived state of Later Han fell in 950 because of Guo Wei, a powerful military governor&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; coup. Liu Min founded the Northern Han Kingdom, sometimes referred to as the Eastern Han, in 951 claiming that he was the legitimate heir to the imperial throne of Later Han. Liu Min immediately restored the traditional relationship with the Khitans, who had founded the Liao dynasty.

Sources conflict as to the origin of the Later Han and Northern Han emperors; some indicate sinicized Shatuo ancestry while some traditional historical sources claim that the emperors claimed patrilineal Han Chinese ancestry.

==Territorial extent==
The Northern Han was a small kingdom located in Shanxi with its capital located at Taiyuan. Shanxi had been a traditional base of power since the fading days of the Tang dynasty in the late ninth century and early tenth century. It was wedged between the two major powers of the day, the Liao dynasty to the north and the Later Zhou dynasty (then the Northern Song dynasty) to the south.

==Wedge between Liao and Song==
The existence of the Northern Han was one of the two major thorns in relations between the Liao Dynasty and Later Zhou&#x27;s successor Northern Song, the other being the continued possession of the Sixteen Prefectures by the Liao Dynasty. The Northern Han had placed itself under the protection of the Liao.

Emperor Taizu of Song was successful in nearly completing the incorporation of the southern kingdoms into the Song Dynasty by his death in 976. His younger brother, Emperor Taizong wished to emulate his older brother&#x27;s successes. Wuyue was brought into the realm in 978.
==Fall of the Northern Han==
Emboldened by his success to the south, Emperor Taizong decided to embark on a campaign to finally destroy the Northern Han. Leading the army himself, he brought his forces to the Northern Han capital of Taiyuan, which was laid under siege in June. An initial relief force sent by the Liao was easily defeated by Song. After a two-month siege of the capital, the emperor of the Northern Han surrendered and the kingdom was incorporated into the Northern Song.

<doc id="346837" wikidata="Q837761" url="?curid=346837" title="Lanceolated warbler">
<text>The lanceolated warbler (Locustella lanceolata) is a species of Old World warbler in the grass warbler genus &quot;Locustella&quot;. It breeds from northeast European Russia across the Palearctic to northern Hokkaidō, Japan. It is migratory, wintering in Southeast Asia. The genus name &quot;Locustella&quot; is from Latin and is a diminutive of &quot;locusta&quot;, &quot;grasshopper&quot;. This refers to the song of the common grasshopper warbler and some others in this genus. The specific &quot; lanceolata&quot; is Latin for &quot;spear-shaped&quot; and refers to the streaks on the breast.

This small passerine bird is a species found in grassland with some thicker shrubby vegetation or trees, often close to water in bogs or wet clearings. Five eggs are laid in a nest in a tussock. This species is a rare vagrant to western Europe. One of the best places to see this skulking species as a vagrant is Fair Isle, Shetland.

This is a small warbler. The adult has a streaked brown back and whitish grey underparts, which have small lance-head like streaks, that are also found on the undertail. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous.

This is a skulking species which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing. It creeps through grass and low foliage.

The song is a monotonous mechanical insect-like reeling as in other species in the group, often given at dusk.

There are two subspecies recorded, as &quot;L. l. lanceolata&quot; and &quot;L. l. hendersonii&quot; .

<doc id="346840" wikidata="Q160206" url="?curid=346840" title="Hernán Crespo">
<text>Hernán Jorge Crespo (; born 5 July 1975) is an Argentine professional football coach and former player. He was most recently the head coach of UAE Pro League club Al Ain.

A prolific striker, Crespo scored over 300 goals in a career spanning 19 years. At international level, he scored 35 goals and is Argentina&#x27;s fourth highest goalscorer behind only Sergio Agüero, Gabriel Batistuta and Lionel Messi. He played in three FIFA World Cups: 1998, 2002, 2006. At club level, Crespo was the world&#x27;s most expensive player when he was bought by Lazio from Parma in 2000 for €56 million (£35.5 million). He was top scorer in the 2000–01 Serie A with 26 goals, playing for Lazio. He is sometimes regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation.

Crespo&#x27;s awards include three Serie A &quot;scudetti&quot;, a Copa Libertadores, a Premier League title and an Olympic Games silver medal. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. Crespo never received a red card during his career.

==Club career==
===River Plate===
Crespo made his debut with River Plate during the 1993–94 season, scoring 13 goals in 25 league appearances as River Plate won the Apertura league title. In 1996, he helped River win the Copa Libertadores, scoring twice in the home leg of the final in Buenos Aires.

===Parma===
Crespo left River Plate for Parma on 14 August 1996 after he won the silver medal with Argentina at the 1996 Summer Olympics and finished as the top scorer with six goals. He failed to score in his first six months at the club and was routinely booed, with head coach Carlo Ancelotti coming in for much criticism for keeping faith with the selection of Crespo. His faith, however, vindicated – Crespo went on to score 12 times in 27 matches in his first Serie A season and Parma finished runners-up to Juventus. The turning point was the standing applause he received for his brace against Cagliari in March 1997. Parma won the 1998–99 Coppa Italia and he scored the opening goal in Parma&#x27;s 3–0 UEFA Cup final victory over Marseille. He had scored 80 goals in four seasons.

===Lazio===
In 2000, Lazio broke the then-world transfer record by paying £35 million (they paid £16 million in cash and transferred Matías Almeyda and Sérgio Conceição) to acquire Crespo, who in turn finished as Serie A&#x27;s top scorer with 26 goals. Lazio, however, failed to defend its league title in 2001, and the following season, Crespo suffered from some injuries, while new signing Gaizka Mendieta failed to live up reputations, following the departures of playmakers Juan Sebastián Verón and Pavel Nedvěd. Crespo was left without the attacking support he had enjoyed in 2001, but still scored a respectable haul of goals. Lazio&#x27;s financial problems, however, forced the club to sell several players, and following Alessandro Nesta&#x27;s transfer to AC Milan, speculation over Crespo&#x27;s future intensified.

===Inter Milan===
On 31 August 2002, Crespo, expected to shine again after suffering from injuries, signed with Inter Milan as a replacement for the ex-player Ronaldo for a €26 million fee and Bernardo Corradi. Lazio later re-valued Corradi to €5.5 million. Inter was short of strikers after the highly rated Mohamed Kallon was injured in August, and only Álvaro Recoba and Christian Vieri and Nicola Ventola, were available.

Crespo scored seven goals in 18 Serie A appearances, along with nine goals in 12 Champions League matches, until he was sidelined for four months by injury in early 2003.

===Chelsea===
Crespo was transferred to Premier League club Chelsea on 26 August 2003 for a fee of reported £16.8 million which also created a controversy in alleged false accounting. Following the transfer, Christian Vieri, Crespo&#x27;s former strike partner at Inter, claimed that the club are essentially &quot;weakening&quot; by selling players of such caliber. He made his league debut on 30 August 2003 as a substitute for Adrian Mutu in a 2–2 home draw against Blackburn Rovers. On 16 September 2003, Crespo made his European debut, replacing Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the 2003–04 Champions League group stage, which ended in a 1–0 away win after a late goal from William Gallas against Sparta Prague. Four days later, he scored his first goals, a double, in a 5–0 away victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Crespo made 73 appearances (26 as a substitute) in all competitions, scoring 25 goals.

==== Loan to AC Milan ====
After José Mourinho took over as Chelsea manager for the 2004–05 season, Crespo became surplus to Chelsea&#x27;s plans following the arrival of Didier Drogba and was loaned to AC Milan, as requested by then-manager Carlo Ancelotti. He scored a total of ten league goals, and scored twice in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final in a defeat to Liverpool.

In scoring a Champions League goal with Milan, Crespo became the first player to score with five teams in the competition, doing so with each of the sides he had played for since moving from South America to Europe in 1996.

==== Return to Chelsea ====
After Chelsea&#x27;s failed attempts to land a big-name striker during the summer of 2005, Mourinho needed competition for Didier Drogba and decided to recall Crespo from Milan, convincing him that he had a future in England. Crespo made his first return appearance in a 2–1 FA Community Shield win over Arsenal. He scored his first league goal of 2005 against newly promoted Wigan Athletic in the 93rd minute of Chelsea&#x27;s season opener in a 1–0 win, with a left foot curler into the top corner from 25 yards. The 2005–06 league title was Crespo&#x27;s first league title victory in European football.

===Return to Inter Milan===
====Second spell; loan from 2006 to 2008====

Though he scored 13 goals in all competitions and won the 2005–06 Premier League, Crespo requested a return to Italy in order to rejoin Milan, but Chelsea refused and announced that Crespo would remain a Chelsea player until the club accepted a suitable offer for him. On 7 August 2006, Crespo re-joined Inter on a two-year loan. He scored his 125th Serie A goal against Siena on 2 December 2006, and his 200th career goal in Europe on 2 April 2007. On 13 May, Crespo scored a hat-trick to help Inter defeat Lazio 4–3 and win the &quot;Scudetto.&quot;

====Third spell; permanent deal====
Crespo was released from Chelsea on 3 July 2008, following the expiration of his contract, and was signed by Inter on a one-year contract for free. In the 2008–09 season, under José Mourinho, his former manager at Chelsea, Crespo only made 13 Serie A appearances, including two starts. He was excluded from the Champions League squad.

===Genoa===
Following the expiration of his contract at Inter, Crespo was quickly snapped up by Genoa, taking Diego Milito&#x27;s place, who moved in the opposite direction. On 8 June 2009, it was reported that Crespo had a medical check to formalize his transfer. Crespo cited his ambition to make the Argentina 2010 World Cup squad as one of his key reasons for making the move to Genoa. On 13 September, Crespo scored his first goal of the 2009 season against Napoli.

===Return to Parma and retirement===
In January 2010, Crespo returned to Parma after the club agreed the deal with Atalanta and Genoa. Crespo replaced Nicola Amoruso who left for Atalanta, while Atalanta&#x27;s Robert Acquafresca moved to Genoa to replace Crespo. The Argentine striker returned after ten years to Parma. Crespo scored just once before the season&#x27;s end, against Livorno. The striker enjoyed a more successful 2010–11 season, scoring eleven goals. In doing so, he became Parma&#x27;s top scorer for a fourth time, which remains a post-war club record. Despite mounting speculation of his departure, Crespo signed a one-year contract extension on 30 June 2011. However, a lack of first-team opportunities saw Crespo and Parma mutually agree to terminate his contract on 2 February 2012, although he did vow to return to the city he had fallen in love with. He is the club&#x27;s all-time record goalscorer with 94 goals in 201 appearances.

Although Crespo was signed to play in Bengal Premier League Soccer in late January 2012, with a salary of £533,000 for the two-month tournament, the competition never got underway. He clarified that his career as a footballer had finished in November 2012.

==International career==
Crespo won his first cap for Argentina in a friendly match against Bulgaria in February 1995. He was a member of the Argentina side that finished runners-up in the 1995 King Fahd Cup, the predecessor to the FIFA Confederations Cup.

In 1996, Crespo was a member of the Argentina men&#x27;s football squad for the Olympic Games. Crespo helped take Argentina to the final with braces against Spain in the quarter-final and Portugal in the semi-final. However, Argentina lost the final to Nigeria, despite Crespo scoring his sixth goal of the tournament from the penalty spot.

Crespo scored his first goal for the Argentina senior team in a 1998 World Cup qualifier against Ecuador and hit a hat-trick against FR Yugoslavia in a pre-World Cup friendly. Crespo was called up to the final roster for the 1998 World Cup but only made one substitute appearance, as Gabriel Batistuta led the Argentine attack. Crespo&#x27;s attempt was saved by David Seaman in the second round penalty shoot-out with England, but Argentina progressed 4–3.

During qualification for the 2002 World Cup, Crespo was top scorer for Argentina with nine goals as they topped the South American group. During the finals, Batistuta was again preferred to Crespo as Argentina&#x27;s starting centre forward. Crespo appeared as a substitute in all three group matches, including the final match against Sweden, which Argentina needed to win in order to qualify for the second round. Though Crespo scored an 88th-minute equaliser, it was not to be enough and Argentina were eliminated.
After the 2002 World Cup, Batistuta retired from international football, and Crespo took over as Argentina&#x27;s number 9. During the 2006 World Cup qualifying stage, Crespo scored seven times, including two goals in Argentina&#x27;s 3–1 win over arch-rivals Brazil in Buenos Aires, which sealed qualification and made him Argentina&#x27;s career scoring leader in World Cup qualifiers.

Crespo scored Argentina&#x27;s first goal of the 2006 World Cup in their opening match against the Ivory Coast. He also scored in the next game against Serbia and Montenegro (6–0) and the second round match against Mexico. However, Argentina&#x27;s run was ended as they were knocked out by host nation Germany on penalties in the quarter-final.

Crespo&#x27;s final appearances for Argentina came at 2007 Copa América. He scored twice in Argentina&#x27;s 4–1 victory over the United States in their Group C opener, tying Diego Maradona&#x27;s team scoring record. He then overtook Maradona in Argentina&#x27;s second match, scoring a penalty kick against Colombia. However, he substituted immediately after converting the kick due to injury and missed the remainder of the tournament.

After the Copa América, Crespo did not receive any further call-ups to the national team and ended his international career with 35 goals in 64 matches, being currently Argentina&#x27;s fourth highest goalscorer of all time.

==Style of play==
Crespo was a fast, tenacious, powerful, and complete striker, who possessed good technique, composure in possession, and an eye for goal; he also excelled in the air. A prolific and opportunistic goal scorer, he was capable of finishing well both with his feet and with his head, and was known for his ability to score acrobatic goals. He was effective off the ball due to his work-rate, tactical intelligence, and attacking movement, which he often used to provide depth for his team or create space for his teammates; he was also capable of linking up well with other forwards. Due to his goalscoring ability and wide range of skills, he is regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation, and as one of Serie A&#x27;s best ever foreign players. He faced several injuries throughout his career, which limited his playing time.

===Nicknames===
While commonly known as Hernán, Crespo was christened Hernando Jorge Crespo, after his grandfather of the same name. His most common nickname is &quot;&quot;Valdanito&quot;, after legendary compatriot striker Jorge Valdano, as he was thought to be his heir due to their similar appearance and eye for goal. He is also, although less often, called &quot;El Polaco&quot;&quot; (or &quot;The Pole&quot;), as his family addressed him that way in his youth because of his light hair.

==Media==
Crespo was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Crespo starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside footballers such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona as the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

==Post-playing and managerial career==
===Coach: Parma and Modena===
On 12 November 2012, Crespo announced that he would pursue a career in coaching and would begin work in early July 2013.

He served as youth coach for the Primavera team of Parma during the 2014–15 season. After the disbandment of Parma, on 30 June 2015, Crespo was announced as the new manager of Serie B club Modena. He was sacked on 26 March 2016, with the club one point above the relegation zone.

===Back to Parma===
On 22 June 2017, Chinese businessman Jiang Lizhang bought 60% of the stocks of Parma, and assigned Crespo as the new vice president of the club. He worked for Jiang&#x27;s company Desport as a technical adviser beforehand.

On 2 January 2018, with the club opting to remove the figure of vice-president from its board, Crespo was named new club ambassador.

===Banfield===
On 19 December 2018, Crespo was appointed manager of Argentine Primera División side Banfield, on an 18-month deal. After finishing 16th in his first season, he was sacked five games into the next in September 2019, having won just one of those games.

===Defensa y Justicia===
On 25 January 2020, Crespo was appointed manager of Defensa y Justicia, also in the Argentine top tier. On 23 January 2021, he led Defensa y Justicia to their first international trophy by winning the Copa Sudamericana, after defeating Lanús by 3–0.

===São Paulo===
On 12 February 2021, Crespo was appointed manager of Brazilian Série A club São Paulo on a two-year deal. He made his debut 16 days later on the first day of the Campeonato Paulista, in a 1–1 home draw with Botafogo. He won the title on 23 May, after a 2–0 aggregate victory over Palmeiras; this was the club&#x27;s first honour in nine years, and the first in the competition since 2005.

On 13 October 2021, Crespo left São Paulo by a mutual agreement. The club were 13th in the national league after 25 games, and he was replaced by team icon Rogério Ceni.

===Al-Duhail===
On 24 March 2022, Crespo succeeded Luís Castro at Al-Duhail in the Qatar Stars League. In his first season, he won a treble of the league, Qatar Cup and Qatari Stars Cup, while also reaching the semi-finals of the AFC Champions League. On 11 October 2023, he left his position at the club by mutual consent.

=== Al Ain ===
After leaving Al-Duhail Crespo was signed by Al Ain on November 2023. He then led the team to the Asian Champions League final, where they beat Yokohama F. Marinos. In the 2024–25 season following some bad results, including a 5–1 defeat to Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s Al Nassr, the club decided to dismiss him.

==Personal life==
In May 2005, Crespo married Italian equestrian Alessia Andra Rossi, with whom he has three children.

== Literature ==

* &quot;Il bulgaro che fu re di Parma per un giorno&quot; (&quot;The Bulgarian who was king of Parma for a day&quot;), by Luca Farinotti, Parma, Diabasis, 2019, Anthology Parma The Capital of Culture 2020. ISBN 978-8881039487, is the novel of the true story of Crespo&#x27;s farewell football match. The tale&#x27;s title comes from the winning assist by the Bulgarian Valeri Bojinov to Crespo at the last second.

<text>The river warbler (Locustella fluviatilis) is an Old World warbler in the grass warbler genus &quot;Locustella&quot;. It breeds in eastern and central Europe, and into the western Palearctic. It is migratory, wintering in inland southern Africa, from around the Zambezi River south to the vicinity of Pretoria in South Africa.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The genus name &quot;Locustella&quot; is from Latin and is a diminutive of &quot;locusta&quot;, &quot;grasshopper&quot;. This refers to the song of the common grasshopper warbler and some others in this genus. The specific &quot;fluviatilis&quot; is Latin for &quot;of a river&quot;.

It&#x27;s a monotypic species.

== Description ==
This is a largish warbler. The adult has an unstreaked grey-brown back, whitish grey underparts, and a darker undertail, which has white feather tips giving a contrasting pattern. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Some birds can show reduced dark markings on the undertail coverts (caused by more extensive than usual white tips) and thus are closer in appearance to Savi&#x27;s warbler than typical river warblers. However, they typically still have a streaked breast and more olive colouration on the upperparts.

This is a skulking species which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing. It creeps through grass and low foliage.

The song is a monotonous mechanical insect-like reeling, often given at dusk. It is similar to the song of other species in the group, but has more of a sewing machine quality, and may be produced for long periods.

== Ecology ==
This small passerine bird is a species found in dense deciduous vegetation close to water in bogs or near a river. Five to seven eggs are laid in a nest in a tussock or on the ground. This species is a rare vagrant to western Europe. In Britain, a small number of males have set up territories in spring, including a bird in Greater Manchester in 1995. One exceptional vagrant was photographed in Gambell, Alaska, in October 2017.

Like most warblers, it is insectivorous.

== Status ==
The river warbler has an extensive range and a large population size. Although its population trend appears to be declining, the rate of decline is not considered rapid enough to meet the thresholds for Vulnerability. As a result, the species is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List.

<text>Savi&#x27;s warbler (Locustella luscinioides) is a species of Old World warbler in the grass warbler genus &quot;Locustella&quot;. It breeds in Europe and the western Palearctic. It is migratory, wintering in northern and sub-Saharan Africa.

This small passerine bird is found in reed beds, usually with some bushes. Three to six eggs are laid in a nest in reeds. The adult has an unstreaked grey-brown back, whitish grey underparts and a lack of throat streaks, which is a distinction from the river warbler. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. This is not a shy species, but can be difficult to see in the reeds except sometimes when singing.

The is a monotonous mechanical insect-like reeling, often given at dusk. It is similar to the song of other species in the group, but is generally faster and deeper and bears a strong resemblance to that of Roesel&#x27;s bush-cricket.

==Taxonomy==
The common name of this bird recognises the Italian ornithologist Paolo Savi, the author of &quot;Ornitologia Toscana&quot; (1827–1831) and &quot;Ornitologia Italiana&quot; (1873–1876). In 1821, Savi was given specimens of an unstreaked, dark, rufous-brown warbler which was new to science. He published a full description of the bird in 1824, and it became known by the common name of Savi&#x27;s warbler. The genus name &quot;Locustella&quot; is from Latin and is a diminutive of &quot;locusta&quot;, &quot;grasshopper&quot;. This refers to the song of the common grasshopper warbler and some others in this genus. The specific &quot;luscinioides&quot; is from Latin &quot;luscinia&quot;, &quot;nightingale&quot;, and Ancient Greek &quot;-oides&quot;, &quot;resembling&quot;.

It forms a species pair with the river warbler, &quot;Locustella fluviatilis&quot;, and studies of mitochondrial DNA show that both are closely related to the lanceolated warbler, &quot;L. lanceolata&quot;, and the common grasshopper warbler, &quot;L. naevia&quot;.

There are three subspecies. &quot;Locustella luscinioides luscinioides&quot; is the nominate subspecies which is native to Central and Eastern Europe, Spain, Portugal and North Africa. It winters in West Africa in an area stretching from Senegal to Lake Chad and northern Ghana, and probably also in South Sudan. &quot;L. l. sarmatica&quot; is native to Ukraine, the Sea of Azov, the Volga region and the Urals; it winters in Northeastern Africa. &quot;L. l. fusca&quot; is found from Jordan and Turkey as far east as central Asia; it winters in Sudan and Ethiopia.

==Description==

The upper-parts of Savi&#x27;s warbler are a uniform dark reddish-brown, sometimes with a slight greenish tinge. It has indistinct buff eye-stripes, dark lores and pale brown ear-coverts. The brown beak is slender and the irises are also brown. The chin, throat and belly are whitish-buff and the rest of the underparts sandy brown. In the breeding season, both upper-parts and underparts are slightly paler. The legs are brown. The bird is around long.

The song is a trill very similar to that of the grasshopper warbler but slightly lower pitched and less prolonged. It is often preceded by a series of low ticks which gradually merge into the trill. The bird sings from high on a reed head with open beak and vibrating throat. Both males and females sing.

==Behaviour==

Savi&#x27;s warbler moults into its breeding plumage before returning to its summer range. On arrival at the wetlands, the birds flit among the reeds and undergrowth and are seldom seen, but on establishing territories, they climb to the top of reeds and sing from prominent positions. They feed on insects such as flies, beetles, moths, grubs and damselflies. Small worms are also believed to be taken. After breeding the birds disperse somewhat to less densely vegetated fens, moult into their winter plumage and depart on their migration. Little is known of their habits in their winter quarters but they occupy similar swampy areas, have been seen in cornfields and may feed and roost in small flocks.

==Breeding==
The breeding season for Savi&#x27;s warbler starts in mid-April in the southern part of its range and at the end of May in Northern Europe. The first males to arrive take up occupation of the best territories, which are judged by the density of the reeds and sedges. As the females arrive, they successively pair with the males with the best territories. Late arrivals have poorer quality territories and their breeding success is impaired, usually because fewer clutches are successfully reared. The nest is built by the female on a little reed platform in the manner of a moorhen&#x27;s nest and is well concealed among dead reeds and clumps of vegetation. It is often made from leaves of &quot;Glyceria&quot; but some nests instead are neatly lined with fine grasses and leaves. It is not usually visible from above. Four to six (occasionally three) eggs are laid. They are greyish-white, liberally speckled with greyish rusty-coloured spots, sometimes in a darker band round the egg. They measure about . Incubation lasts for about twelve days and is done exclusively by the female. She also feeds the chicks when they first hatch with the male joining in as they grow. The young fledge in about twelve days and there are normally two broods.

==Distribution and habitat==
Savi&#x27;s warbler breeds in Algeria, Spain, Mallorca, France, Sicily, Crete, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Jordan, Turkey and Russia as far east as the River Volga. It winters in Algeria, Morocco, Sudan and Ethiopia. It is known as an occasional visitor to the United Kingdom (where a few pairs breed sporadically), Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Cyprus and Israel.

Savi&#x27;s warbler is to be found in reed beds, marshes and lagoons with reeds, sedges and other marsh vegetation, perhaps with scattered sallows or bushes. It climbs stems in order to sing in full view but is otherwise difficult to see as it flits with agility through the stems and tangled growth and is seldom seen on open ground. It occupies similar habitats in its winter quarters but may also be found in fens or marshy locations with open water away from reeds.

==Status==
Savi&#x27;s warbler is assessed by the IUCN in their Red List of Threatened Species as being of least concern. This is because it has a large total population and an extensive range. The population in Europe is estimated to be between 530 and 800 thousand breeding pairs with a total of 1.6 to 2.4 million individuals. As Europe amounts to about two thirds of its total range, the world population may be in the region of 2.1 to 4.8 million individuals. Numbers of birds may be decreasing somewhat but not to the extent that would warrant listing Savi&#x27;s warbler under a higher risk category.

<text>This is a list of broadcast television stations that are licensed in the U.S. state of Hawaii. Each of the three municipal counties — Honolulu County, Maui County and Hawaii County — has its own set of stations. Kauai County has repeaters which broadcast Honolulu&#x27;s stations through its islands.

==Full-power stations==
VC refers to the station&#x27;s PSIP virtual channel. RF refers to the station&#x27;s physical RF channel.
===Defunct full-power stations===
*Channel 13: KHVH-TV (original) - Honolulu (5/5/1957-7/16/1958)

==LPTV stations==
==Translators==
==Other islands==
Many inhabited areas of Molokai and Lanai are within range of TV stations and repeaters located on facing areas of Oahu and Maui. Likewise, viewers on Niihau are served by transmitters on the west of Kauai.

==Early conversion to digital==
On January 15, 2009, Hawaii became the first state in the United States to permanently have its television stations switch from analog to digital early. Hawaii&#x27;s full-power TV stations, including network affiliates and independent stations, ceased analog broadcasting at noon on that date. With the exception of residents on Kauai, households that receive TV signals over the air will need to connect a converter box to sets in order to continue watching TV, since Kauai is the only part of Hawaii that receives over-the-air television signals via low-power translators that are not affected by the DTV transition.

Existing analog facilities at Maui&#x27;s Haleakalā volcano are to be removed due to ongoing interference with astronomy equipment operated under the United States Department of Defense and the University of Hawaii. The digital stations are being deployed using new facilities at Ulupalakua and the old towers will be removed before the Hawaiian petrels&#x27; nesting season begins in March. By making the switch early, the broadcast towers atop Haleakalā near the birds&#x27; nesting grounds can be dismantled without interfering with their habits.

<doc id="346854" wikidata="Q3288585" url="?curid=346854" title="Stan Freberg">
<text>Stan Freberg (born Stanley Friberg; August 7, 1926 – April 7, 2015) was an American actor, author, comedian, musician, puppeteer, radio personality and advertising creative director.

His best-known works include &quot;St. George and the Dragonet&quot;, &quot;Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America&quot;, his role on the television series &quot;Time for Beany&quot;, multiple characters in the Looney Tunes such as Pete Puma and Bertie, and a number of classic television commercials.

==Early and personal life==
Freberg was born Stanley Friberg on August 7, 1926 in Pasadena, California, the son of Evelyn Dorothy (née Conner), a housewife, and Victor Richard Friberg (later Freberg), a Baptist minister. Freberg was of Swedish and Irish descent.

He was drafted in the US Army from 1945 to 1947 where he served in Special Services attached to the Medical Corps at McCornack General Hospital in Pasadena, California.

Freberg&#x27;s work reflected both his gentle sensitivity (despite his liberal use of biting satire and parody) and his refusal to accept alcohol and tobacco manufacturers as sponsors—an impediment to his radio career when he took over for Jack Benny on CBS radio. As Freberg explained to Rusty Pipes:
Freberg&#x27;s first wife, Donna, died in 2000. He had two children from that marriage, Donna Jean and Donavan. He married Betty Hunter in 2001.

==Animation==
Freberg began his career doing impersonations on Cliffie Stone&#x27;s radio show in 1943. Freberg was employed as a voice actor in animation shortly after graduating from Alhambra High School. He began at Warner Brothers in 1944 by getting on a bus and asking the driver to let him off &quot;in Hollywood&quot;. As he describes in his autobiography, &quot;It Only Hurts When I Laugh&quot;, he got off the bus and found a sign that said &quot;talent agency&quot;. He walked in, and the agents there arranged for him to audition for Warner Brothers cartoons where he was promptly hired. Thus began Freberg&#x27;s professional career in entertainment, which lasted for more than 70 years, all the way up to his death.

His first notable cartoon voice work was in a Warner Brothers cartoon called &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fala&quot;, which was recorded but never filmed (due to the death of Fala&#x27;s owner, President Franklin D. Roosevelt), followed by &quot;Roughly Squeaking&quot; (1946) as Bertie; and in 1947, he was heard in &quot;It&#x27;s a Grand Old Nag&quot; (Charlie Horse), produced and directed by Bob Clampett for Republic Pictures; &quot;The Goofy Gophers&quot; (Tosh), and &quot;One Meat Brawl&quot; (Grover Groundhog and Walter Winchell).
Freberg voiced the character of Junyer Bear, but the role was actually created by actor Kent Rogers in &quot;Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears&quot; (1944). After Rogers was killed during World War II, Freberg assumed the role of Junyer Bear in Chuck Jones&#x27; Looney Tunes cartoon &quot;What&#x27;s Brewin&#x27;, Bruin?&quot; (1948). This featured Jones&#x27; version of The Three Bears.

He often found himself paired with Mel Blanc while at Warner Bros., where the two men performed such pairs as the mice Hubie and Bertie, the Goofy Gophers Mac and Tosh, and Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier. In 1952, he was the voice of Friz Freleng&#x27;s &quot;Dumb Dog&quot; in &quot;Foxy by Proxy&quot;, who meets up with a disguised Bugs Bunny wearing a fox suit. He was the voice of Pete Puma in the 1952 cartoon &quot;Rabbit&#x27;s Kin&quot;, in which he did an impression of an early Frank Fontaine characterization (which later became Fontaine&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Guggenheim&quot; character).

Freberg&#x27;s work as a voice actor for Walt Disney Productions included the role of Mr. Busy the Beaver in &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955), and he did voice work in &quot;Susie the Little Blue Coupe&quot; and &quot;Lambert the Sheepish Lion&quot;. He received screen credit for his voice work on &quot;Three Little Bops&quot; (1957), where he voiced all the characters and sang the titular song. Freberg&#x27;s interpretation of Pete Puma also provided the basis for Daws Butler&#x27;s voice of Sam, the orange cat paired with Sylvester in the Academy Award-nominated short &quot;Mouse and Garden&quot; (1960). He voiced Cage E. Coyote, the father of Wile E. Coyote, in the 2000 short &quot;Little Go Beep&quot;.

==Films==
Freberg was cast to sing the part of the Jabberwock in the song &quot;Beware the Jabberwock&quot; for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, with the Rhythmaires and Daws Butler. Written by Don Raye and Gene de Paul, the song was a musical rendering of the poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. The song was not included in the final film, but a demo recording was included in the 2004 and 2010 DVD releases of the film.

Freberg made his film debut in the comedy &quot;Callaway Went Thataway&quot; (1951), a satirical spoof on the marketing of Western stars (apparently inspired by the TV success of Hopalong Cassidy). Freberg costarred with Mala Powers in &quot;Geraldine&quot; (1954) as sobbing singer Billy Weber, enabling him to reprise his satire on vocalist Johnnie Ray (see below). In 1963&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, Freberg appeared in a non-speaking role as the Deputy Sheriff and acted as the voice of a dispatcher.

Contrary to popular belief, George Lucas called upon Freberg, not Mel Blanc, to audition for the voice of the character C-3PO for the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;. After he and many others auditioned for the part, Freberg suggested that Lucas use mime actor Anthony Daniels&#x27; voice.

==Capitol Records==
===Early releases===
Freberg was one of the talents recruited by Capitol Records when it launched its spoken-word division. He began on February 10, 1951, and produced satirical recordings about popular culture. One of his most notable releases was &quot;John and Marsha&quot;, a soap opera parody that consisted of the title characters (both played by Freberg) doing nothing but repeating each other&#x27;s names (with intonations to match the moods). Some radio stations refused to play &quot;John &amp; Marsha&quot;, believing it to be an actual romantic conversation between two real people. In a 1954 follow-up, he used pedal steel guitarist Speedy West to satirize the 1953 Ferlin Husky country hit, &quot;A Dear John Letter&quot;, as &quot;A Dear John and Marsha Letter&quot; (Capitol 2677). West had played on the Husky hit recording. A seasonal recording, &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;/&quot;Nuttin&#x27; for Christmas&quot;, made in 1955, still remains a cult classic.

Another hit to receive the Freberg treatment was Johnnie Ray&#x27;s weepy &quot;Cry&quot;, which Freberg rendered as &quot;Try&quot;, exaggerating Ray&#x27;s histrionic vocal style. Johnnie Ray was furious until he realized the success of Freberg&#x27;s 1952 parody was actually increasing sales and airplay of his own record. Freberg reported getting more angry feedback for this than from any of his other parodies.

With Daws Butler and June Foray, Freberg produced his 1953 &quot;Dragnet&quot; parody, &quot;St. George and the Dragonet&quot;, a No. 1 hit for four weeks in October 1953. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.

After &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot; (1951), he followed with more popular musical satires, such as &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; (1954), a parody of the song recorded by The Chords. At the end, he yells &quot;STELLA!&quot; at a woman, imitating Marlon Brando in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. The B side was a parody of the Eartha Kitt record &quot;C&#x27;est si bon&quot;, broadcast in 1955 on the TV show &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;. Other songs include &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas&quot; (1955), where a &quot;Yankee&quot; snare drummer gets out of hand on the recording; &quot;Rock Around Stephen Foster&quot;, a parody of recordings by Bill Haley and others in which a music arranger (Freberg) tries with mixed results to get a chorus to perform a medley of Foster&#x27;s standards in rock and roll style at one point adding Foster&#x27;s lyrics to Haley&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;; &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;, based on the 1955 Lonnie Donegan skiffle version, with interruptions by Peter Leeds; and a spoof of The Platters&#x27; hit &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; (1956).

He recorded a parody of Elvis Presley&#x27;s first chart record, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. In Freberg&#x27;s version, the echo effect goes out of control, and &quot;Elvis&quot; eventually rips his tight jeans during the performance.

With Foray, he recorded &quot;The Quest for Bridey Hammerschlaugen&quot;, a spoof of &quot;The Search for Bridey Murphy&quot; by Morey Bernstein, a 1956 book on hypnotic regression to a past life, and an LP of the first actual hypnosis session.

===&quot;The Great Pretender&quot; and &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;===
Freberg used a beatnik musician theme in his 1956 parody of &quot;The Great Pretender&quot;, the hit by The Platters—who, like Ray (see above) and Belafonte and Welk (see both below), were not pleased. At that time, when it was still hoped that musical standards might be preserved, it was quite permissible to ridicule the ludicrous, as Freberg had obviously thought when he parodied Presley. The pianist in Freberg&#x27;s parody, a devotee of Erroll Garner and George Shearing, rebels against playing a single-chord accompaniment, retorting, &quot;I&#x27;m not playing that &#x27;clink-clink-clink jazz&#x27;!&quot; But Freberg is adamant about the pianist&#x27;s sticking to The Platters&#x27; style: &quot;You play that &#x27;clink-clink-clink jazz&#x27;, or you won&#x27;t get paid tonight!&quot; The pianist relents—sort of. The pianist even quotes the first six notes from Shearing&#x27;s classic piece &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot;, before returning to the song. The song concludes with the pianist taking a liking to the arrangement only after he gets into an uncontrollably accelerating groove, despite the histrionic singer&#x27;s pleas to keep tempo; the singer has to escape the studio.

Freberg&#x27;s &quot;Banana Boat (Day-O)&quot; (1957) satirized Harry Belafonte&#x27;s popular recording of &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;. In Freberg&#x27;s version, the lead singer is forced to run down the hall and close the door after him to muffle the sound of his &quot;Day-O!&quot; because the beatnik bongo drummer, voiced by Leeds, complains, &quot;It&#x27;s too shrill, man. It&#x27;s too piercing!&quot; When he gets to the lyric about &quot;A beautiful buncha ripe banana/Hide the deadly black tarantula&quot;, the drummer protests, &quot;I don&#x27;t dig spiders!&quot; The flip is &quot;Tele-Vee-Shun&quot;, an anti-TV song about what television has done to his family, sung in a heavy faux-Trinidadian accent and set to a Calypso tune. Freberg first recorded the song in 1952, but the 1957 version is the most well known, which lampoons Elvis Presley in one verse: &quot;I turn on Elvis Presley and my daughter scream. / I fear she have a nervous breakdown cos of heem. / I wonder why he wiggle-waggle to de beat. / As a boy he must have had a loose bicycle seat.&quot;

Freberg&#x27;s musical parodies were a product of his collaborations with Billy May, a veteran big band musician and jazz arranger, and his Capitol Records producer, Ken Nelson.. In late 1957, as TV &quot;champagne music&quot; master Lawrence Welk&#x27;s ABC TV show gained popularity nationwide, Freberg released &quot;Wun&#x27;erful, Wun&#x27;erful! (Sides uh-one &amp; uh-two)&quot;, a freewheeling mockery of the show, Welk&#x27;s stilted, cornball delivery and the questionable musicianship of some of Welk&#x27;s sidemen. To faithfully replicate Welk&#x27;s sound, May and some of Hollywood&#x27;s finest studio musicians and vocalists worked to clone Welk&#x27;s live on-air style, carefully incorporating bad notes and mistimed cues. Billy Liebert, a first-rate accordionist, copied Welk&#x27;s accordion playing. In the parody, the orchestra is overwhelmed by the malfunctioning bubble machine and the entire Aragon Ballroom eventually floats out to sea. When he met Freberg, Welk denied he had ever said &quot;Wunnerful, Wunnerful!&quot; and objected to the ending, futilely asking to have the orchestra rescued. But despite his denial of the phrase, Welk made it the title of his autobiography (Prentice Hall, 1971), and he never publicly stated his exact reasons. Among the regulars on Welk&#x27;s show who were lampooned were &quot;Champagne Lady&quot; Alice Lon, who became &quot;Alice Lean&quot;, Larry Hooper became &quot;Larry Looper&quot;, trumpeter-novelty singer Rocky Rockwell became &quot;Stony Stonedwell&quot; and the Lennon Sisters became the &quot;Lemon Sisters.&quot; Freberg had performed a lengthier version of the sketch on the August 11, 1957 episode of &quot;The Stan Freberg Show&quot;.

===Political satire===
Freberg also tackled political issues of the day. On his radio show, an extended sketch paralleled the Cold War brinkmanship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union by portraying an ever-escalating public relations battle between the El Sodom and the Rancho Gomorrah, two casinos in the city of Los Voraces (Spanish for &quot;The Greedy Ones&quot;—a thinly disguised Las Vegas). The sketch ends with the ultimate tourist attraction, the Hydrogen Bomb, which turns Los Voraces into a vast, barren wasteland. Network pressure forced Freberg to remove the reference to the hydrogen bomb and had the two cities being destroyed by an earthquake instead. The version of &quot;Incident at Los Voraces&quot;, released later on Capitol Records, contains the original ending.

Freberg had poked fun at McCarthyism in passing in &quot;Little Blue Riding Hood&quot; with the line, &quot;Only the color has been changed to prevent an investigation.&quot; Later, he blatantly parodied Senator Joseph McCarthy with &quot;Point of Order&quot; (taken from his frequent objection). The &quot;suspect&quot; being investigated was the black sheep from the nursery rhyme, &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot;. (Butler: &quot;I would be suspicious of anyone who tried to rhyme &quot;dame&quot; with &quot;lane&quot;.&quot;) Capitol&#x27;s legal department was very nervous. Freberg describes being called in for a chat with Robert Karp, the department head, and being asked whether he had ever belonged to any group that might get attention from McCarthy. He replied, &quot;I am, and have been for a long time, a card-carrying member of... &quot;—the executive went pale—&quot;... the Little Orphan Annie Fan Club of America.&quot; The executive retorted, &quot;No, this is serious; this is not funny, Freberg. Stop making jokes!&quot; A watered-down version of the parody was eventually aired.

===Controversy===
On two occasions, Capitol refused to release Freberg&#x27;s records. &quot;That&#x27;s Right, Arthur&quot; was a barbed parody of controversial 1950s radio/TV personality Arthur Godfrey, who expected his stable of performers—known as &quot;little Godfreys&quot;—to toady to him endlessly. The dialogue included Freberg&#x27;s &quot;Godfrey&quot; monologue, punctuated by Butler imitating Godfrey announcer Tony Marvin, repeatedly interjecting, &quot;That&#x27;s right, Arthur!&quot; between Godfrey&#x27;s comments. Capitol feared Godfrey might take legal action and sent a copy of Freberg&#x27;s record to Godfrey&#x27;s legal department for permission, which was denied. Capitol also rejected the equally acerbic &quot;Most of the Town&quot;, a spoof of Ed Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Toast of the Town&quot;, under similar circumstances. Both recordings were eventually issued in a box-set Freberg retrospective issued by Rhino Records.

Freberg continued to skewer the advertising industry after the demise of his show, producing and recording &quot;Green Chri$tma$&quot; in 1958, a scathing indictment of the over-commercialization of the holiday, in which Butler soberly hoped instead that we&#x27;d remember &quot;Whose birthday we&#x27;re celebrating&quot;. The satire ended abruptly with a rendition of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; punctuated by cash register sounds. The original version was somewhat longer when it was first released in 1958, but in later years Capitol did not reissue the full recording. Freberg also revisited the &quot;Dragnet&quot; theme, with &quot;Yulenet&quot;, also known as &quot;Christmas Dragnet&quot;, in which the strait-laced detective convinces a character named &quot;Grudge&quot; that Santa Claus really exists (and Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and the Easter Bunny, but Grudge still hadn&#x27;t made up his mind yet about Toledo). Butler does several voices on the record.

===&quot;Oregon! Oregon!&quot;===
In 1958, the Oregon Centennial Commission, under the sponsorship of Blitz-Weinhard Brewing Company, hired Freberg to create a musical to celebrate Oregon&#x27;s one-hundredth birthday.
The result was &quot;Oregon! Oregon! A Centennial Fable in Three Acts.&quot; Recorded at Capitol in Hollywood, it was released during the Oregon Centennial in 1959 as a 12″ vinyl LP album. Side one featured two versions of an introduction by Freberg (billed as &quot;Stan Freberg, Matinee Idol&quot;), with the second version including a few words from the president of Blitz-Weinhard Co. This was followed by the show itself, which runs for 21 minutes. Side two includes separate individual versions of each of the featured songs, including several variations on the title piece, &quot;Oregon! Oregon!&quot;

Fifty years later, as Oregon approached its Sesquicentennial, an updated version was prepared by Freberg and the Portland band Pink Martini as part of a signature series of performances throughout the state. Pink Martini toured the state and performed four regional performances in the northern, southern and central areas of Oregon in August and September 2009. This was made possible by a grant from the Kinsman Foundation for a $40,000 launch of Pink Martini&#x27;s &quot;Oregon! Oregon! 2009&quot; with Freberg.

===1960s and later===
In 1960, in the light of the payola scandal, Freberg made a two-sided single titled &quot;The Old Payola Roll Blues&quot;, which tells the story of a corrupt recording studio promoter (voiced by Jesse White) who finds &quot;Clyde Ankle&quot; (a play on the name of singer Paul Anka, with a storyline paralleling that of Bob Marcucci&#x27;s discovery of Fabian), a teenager who cannot sing. Clyde records a song called &quot;High School OO OO&quot;, which lasted only a few seconds. (Noting the brevity, Ankle asks, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that kind of a short song?&quot; to which the producer answers, &quot;Yeah, it gets more plays that way.&quot;) &quot;I Was on My Way to High School&quot; (complete with fake audience noise from a &quot;scream machine&quot;) is the corresponding flip side.

The promoter then tries to bribe a disc jockey at a jazz station to play the song on the air, which he flatly refuses, suspecting that the promoter was never in the music business in the first place. Afterward, a song in the big band style heralds the end of rock and roll and a resurgence of swing and jazz. Freberg&#x27;s record was on the Hot 100 only the week of Leap Day 1960, at #99, about three and a half months after Tommy Facenda&#x27;s multi-versioned &quot;High School U.S.A.&quot; peaked at #28. Alan Freed, whose career fell prey to charges of payola, reportedly laughed at Freberg&#x27;s interpretation of the scandal.

&quot;Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America, Volume One: The Early Years&quot; (1961) combined dialogue and song in a musical theater format. The original album musical, released on Capitol, parodies the history of the United States from 1492 until the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783. In it, Freberg parodied both large and small aspects of history. For instance, in the Colonial era, it was common to use the long s, which resembles a lowercase f, in the middle of words; thus, as Ben Franklin is reading the Declaration of Independence, he questions the passage, &quot;Life, liberty, and the &quot;purfuit of happineff?!?&quot;&quot; Most of that particular sketch is a satire of McCarthyism. For example, Franklin remarks, &quot;You...sign a harmless petition, and forget all about it. Ten years later, you get hauled up before a committee.&quot;

The album also featured the following exchange, where Freberg&#x27;s Christopher Columbus is &quot;discovered on beach here&quot; by a Native American played by Marvin Miller. Skeptical of the Natives&#x27; diet of corn and &quot;other organically grown vegetables&quot;, Columbus wants to open &quot;America&#x27;s first Italian restaurant&quot; and needs to cash a check to get started:
In 2019, &quot;Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America, Volume One: The Early Years&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

&quot;Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America, Volume Two&quot; was planned for release during America&#x27;s Bicentennial in 1976, but did not emerge until 1996.

Freberg&#x27;s early parodies revealed his obvious love of jazz. His portrayals of jazz musicians were usually stereotypical &quot;beatnik&quot; types, but jazz was always portrayed as preferable to pop, calypso, and particularly the then-new form of music, rock and roll. He whopped doo-wop in his version of &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; and lampooned Elvis Presley with an echo/reverb rendition of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. &quot;The United States of America&quot; includes a sketch involving the musicians in the painting &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;. The terribly hip fife player (&quot;Bix&quot;, played by Freberg) and the younger drummer (played by Walter Tetley) argue with the older, impossibly square drummer (&quot;Doodle&quot;, also voiced by Freberg) over how &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; should be performed.

==Radio==
The popularity of Freberg&#x27;s recordings landed him his own radio program, the situation comedy &quot;That&#x27;s Rich&quot;. Freberg portrayed bumbling but cynical Richard E. Wilt, a resident of Hope Springs, where he worked for B.B. Hackett&#x27;s Consolidated Paper Products Company. Freberg suggested the addition of dream sequences, which made it possible for him to perform his more popular Capitol Records satires before a live studio audience. The series was broadcast over the CBS Radio Network from January 8 to September 23, 1954.

&quot;The Stan Freberg Show&quot; was a 1957 replacement for Jack Benny on CBS radio. The satirical show, produced by Pete Barnum, featured elaborate production, and included most of the team he used on his Capitol recordings, including Foray, Leeds, and Butler. Billy May arranged and conducted the music. The Jud Conlon Singers, who had also appeared on Freberg recordings, were regulars, as was singer Peggy Taylor, who later that year participated in his &quot;Wun&#x27;erful, Wun&#x27;erful!&quot; two-sided 45, recorded to capitalize on the response it received on the show.

The show failed to attract a sponsor after Freberg decided he did not want to be associated with the tobacco companies that had sponsored Benny. In lieu of actual commercials, Freberg mocked advertising by touting such products as &quot;Puffed Grass&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s good for Bossie, it&#x27;s good for me and you!&quot;), &quot;Food&quot; (&quot;Put some food in your tummy-tum-tum!&quot;), and himself (&quot;Stan Freberg—the foaming comedian! Bobba-bobba-bom-bom-bom&quot;), a parody of the well-known Ajax cleanser commercial.

The lack of sponsorship was not the only problem, and Freberg also complained of radio network interference, factors which forced the cancellation of the show after a run of only 15 episodes. One sketch, &quot;Elderly Man River&quot;, parodied the interference, as well as anticipating the political correctness movement by decades. Butler played &quot;Mr. Tweedly&quot;, a representative of a fictional citizens&#x27; radio review board, who constantly interrupts Freberg with a loud buzzer as Freberg attempts to sing &quot;Old Man River&quot;. Tweedly first objects to the word &quot;old&quot;, &quot;which some of our more &quot;elderly&quot; citizens find distasteful&quot;. As a result of Tweedly&#x27;s interventions, the song&#x27;s lyrics are progressively and painfully distorted, as Freberg struggles to sing the classic song in a form that Tweedly says must be acceptable &quot;to the tiny tots&quot; listening at home: &quot;He don&#x27;t, er, &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; plant &#x27;taters, er, &quot;potatoes&quot;, he doesn&#x27;t plant cotton, er, &quot;cotting&quot;, and &quot;them-these-those&quot; that plants them are soon &quot;forgotting&quot;&quot;, was a lyric of which Freberg was particularly proud. Even when the censor finds Freberg&#x27;s rendition acceptable, the constant interruptions ultimately bring the song to a grinding halt just before Freberg would have had to edit the line &quot;You gets a little drunk and you lands in jail&quot;. Freberg concedes, &quot;Take your finger off the button, Mr. Tweedly—we know when we&#x27;re licked&quot;, furnishing both the moral and the punch line of the sketch.

In 1966, he recorded an album, &quot;Freberg Underground&quot;, in a format similar to his radio show, using the same cast and orchestra. He called it &quot;pay radio&quot;, a parody of the term pay TV, the nickname at the time for subscription-based television, &quot;... because you have to go into the record store and buy it&quot;. The album is notable for giving Dr. Edward Teller the &quot;Father of the Year&quot; award for being &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb&quot; (&quot;Use it in good health!&quot;); for lampooning all-digit dialing (&quot;They Took Away Our Murray Hills&quot;); and for &quot;The Flak-man and Reagan&quot;, a combined satire of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series featuring Robin, and the 1966 California Governor&#x27;s race between Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown and Ronald Reagan, in which the idea of Reagan in the future running for U.S. president and winning, was used in song as a final, over-the-top gag.

With the use of sound effects in an imaginary sequence for a promotional announcement for radio, Freberg drained Lake Michigan and filled it with hot chocolate, then cued a 700-foot mountain of whipped cream to roll into it, after which the Royal Canadian Air Force towed a 10-ton maraschino cherry overhead and dropped it on top. Some 25,000 imaginary extras cheered.

Freberg returned to radio in several episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; radio dramas in the early 2000s, including &quot;The Brain Center at Whipple&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Four O&#x27;Clock&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Gentlemen, Be Seated&quot;, &quot;Kick the Can&quot;, &quot;The Masks&quot;, and &quot;Static&quot;.

==Television==
Beginning in 1949, Freberg and Butler provided voices and were the puppeteers for Bob Clampett&#x27;s puppet series, &quot;Time for Beany&quot;, a triple Emmy Award winner (1950, 1951, 1953). which was broadcast live on KTLA in Los Angeles, and distributed nationwide via kinescope by the Paramount Television Network, the pioneering children&#x27;s TV show garnered considerable acclaim. Among its fans was Albert Einstein, who once reportedly interrupted a high-level conference by announcing, &quot;You will have to excuse me, gentlemen. It is time for Beany.&quot;

Freberg made television guest appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and other TV variety shows, usually with Orville the Moon Man, his puppet from outer space; he reached through the bottom of Orville&#x27;s flying saucer to control the puppet&#x27;s movements and turned away from the camera when he delivered Orville&#x27;s lines. Freberg had his own ABC special, &quot;Stan Freberg Presents the Chun King Chow Mein Hour: Salute to the Chinese New Year&quot; (February 4, 1962), but he garnered more laughs when he was a guest on late night talk shows.

A piece from Freberg&#x27;s show was used frequently on Offshore Radio in the UK in the ’60s: &quot;You may not find us on your TV&quot;. Other on-screen television roles included &quot;The Monkees&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1967). Federal Budget Review was a 1982 (copyright 1980) PBS television special lampooning the federal government. In 1996, he portrayed the continuing character of Mr. Parkin on &quot;Roseanne&quot;, and both Freberg and his son had roles in the short-lived &quot;Weird Al Show&quot; in 1997.

===Advertising===
Freberg founded the Los Angeles-based advertising agency Freberg Limited, which produced radio and television commercials. Two of his largest clients were General Motors and Mellon Bank. He is noted for introducing satire to the field of advertising and revolutionized the industry by influencing staid ad agencies to imitate his style into their previously dead-serious commercials. Freberg had an affinity with the radio platform, stating that it is a special medium capable of stretching the imagination more than television.

Freberg&#x27;s long list of successful ad campaigns includes:
* Butter-Nut Coffee: A nine-minute musical, &quot;Omaha!&quot; which found success outside advertising as a musical production in the city of Omaha. It tells the story of a young man, &quot;Eustace K. Butternut&quot;, who was stolen by Gypsies at an early age and, as an adult, returns to his own city, finding the residents under a spell that keeps them singing and raising their arms in the air. He frees them by saying his last name backwards (&quot;Tunrettub&quot;), but he immediately orders them to raise their hands back up again, taking everything the citizens have.
* Contadina tomato paste: &quot;Who put eight great tomatoes in that little bitty can?&quot;
* Jeno&#x27;s pizza rolls: A parody of the Lark cigarettes commercial that used the William Tell Overture and a pickup truck with a sign in the bed saying &quot;Show us your Lark pack&quot;, here ending with a confrontation between a cigarette smoker, portrayed by Barney Phillips (supposedly representing the Lark commercial&#x27;s announcer) and Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger over the use of the music. Jay Silverheels also appears as Tonto, filling his possibles bag with pizza rolls, after asking &quot;Have a Pizza Roll, kemo sabe?&quot; It was regarded as one of the most brilliantly conceived and executed TV ads of the period; after one showing on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Johnny Carson remarked that it was the first commercial he had ever seen to receive spontaneous applause from the studio audience.
* Jeno&#x27;s pizza, in a parody of Scope mouthwash commercials. &quot;You know why nobody likes your parties, Mary? You have bad pizza—&quot;bad pizza&quot;!&quot;
* Sunsweet pitted prunes: Depicted as the &quot;food of the future&quot; in a futuristic setting, until science fiction icon Ray Bradbury, a friend of Freberg&#x27;s (shown on a wall-to-wall television screen reminiscent of &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;) butts in: &quot;I never mentioned prunes in any of my stories.&quot; &quot;You didn&#x27;t?&quot; &quot;No, never. I&#x27;m sorry to be so candid.&quot; &quot;No, they&#x27;re not candied&quot; (rim shot). Bradbury reportedly refused to consider doing a commercial until Freberg told him, &quot;I&#x27;m calling it &quot;Brave New Prune&quot;&quot;, prompting Bradbury to ask, &quot;When do we start?&quot; Prune sales increased 400 percent the year following the campaign.
* Another Sunsweet commercial features Ronald Long as a picky eater: &quot;They&#x27;re still rather badly wrinkled, you know&quot;, and ends with the famous line, &quot;Today, the pits; tomorrow, the wrinkles. Sunsweet marches on!&quot;
* Heinz Great American Soups: Ann Miller is a housewife who turns her kitchen into a gigantic production number, singing such lyrics as &quot;Let&#x27;s face the chicken gumbo and dance!&quot; After watching his wife&#x27;s flashy tap dancing, her husband, played by veteran character actor Dave Willock, asks, &quot;Why do you always have to make such a big production out of everything?&quot; At the time (1970), this was the most expensive commercial ever made.
* Jacobsen Mowers: Sheep slowly munch on a front lawn. On camera reporter/announcer (voice of William Woodson): &quot;Jacobsen mowers. Faster... than sheep!&quot;
* &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;: A sardonic, bespectacled high schooler (played by Freberg&#x27;s son Donavan) announces he has a major paper due soon. Freberg as the offscreen narrator advises him (and the audience) to try the encyclopedia, while the student chides him for being too pushy (&quot;they can see the number on the bottom of the screen&quot;).
* &quot;Chun King Chinese Food&quot;: Magazine ad, featuring a lineup of nine Chinese men and one white man, all with stethoscopes around their necks and dressed in white doctors&#x27; tunics, with the caption, &quot;Nine out of ten doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein!&quot;
* Kaiser Aluminum produced foil to rival Reynolds Wrap. Freberg created a sales campaign based on Kaiser&#x27;s difficulties in getting grocers to stock their product, featuring the &quot;Kaiser Foil Salesman&quot;. Despite the company&#x27;s initial hesitation, the campaign produced a huge increase in distribution and sales.
* Prince Spaghetti: In 1985, Freberg produced a commercial announcing &quot;Prince in Concert!&quot; But it turned out to be Prince Spaghetti Sauce &quot;in concert with&quot; Prince Spaghetti. The rock star was not amused and sent a letter demanding they cease airing the commercial. Company President Joseph Pellegrino wrote back saying, in effect, they had the name first. The singer quietly let it go. Freberg told &quot;Time&quot; that though he&#x27;d never been sued, this was the first time he&#x27;d received an angry letter.

Freberg was also very popular in Australia, visiting there several times in the 1950s as a performer in a number of &quot;Big Show&quot; concerts. In 1959 he wrote and voiced an animated TV commercial in Sydney for Sunshine Powdered Milk, which won a TV &quot;Logie&quot; as one of the most popular TV commercials of the year in an annual awards ceremony.

Today, these advertisements are considered classics by many critics. Though Bob &amp; Ray had pioneered intentionally comic advertisements (stemming from a hugely successful campaign for Piels beer), Stan Freberg is usually credited as being the first person to introduce humor into television advertising with memorable campaigns. He felt a truly funny commercial would cause consumers to request a product, as was the case with his elaborate ad campaign that prompted stores to stock Salada tea. Jeno Paulucci, then the owner of Chun King, had to pay off a bet over the success of Freberg&#x27;s first commercial by pulling Freberg in a rickshaw on Hollywood&#x27;s La Cienega Boulevard. Freberg won 21 Clio awards for his commercials. Many of those spots were included in the Freberg four-CD box set &quot;Tip of the Freberg&quot;.

==Later work==

Following his success in comedy records and television, Freberg was often invited to appear as a featured guest at various events, such as his skit at the 1978 Science Fiction Film Awards, again playing straight man to Orville in his UFO. He innocently asks why there is a hole in the end of the spacecraft, only to be told, &quot;That&#x27;s where the swamp gas comes out.&quot;

In his autobiography, &quot;It Only Hurts When I Laugh&quot;, Freberg recounts much of his life and early career, including his encounters with such show business legends as Milton Berle, Frank Sinatra and Ed Sullivan, and the struggles he endured to get his material on the air.

He had brief sketches on KNX (AM) radio in the mid-1990s, beginning each with &quot;Freberg here!&quot; In one sketch, Freberg mentioned that the band played &quot;Inhale to the Chief&quot; at Bill Clinton&#x27;s inauguration.

He guest starred multiple times on &quot;The Garfield Show&quot; where he provided the voice of Dr. Whipple, and as the studio chairman on an episode of &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;.

Freberg was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995. From 1995 until October 6, 2006, Freberg hosted &quot;When Radio Was&quot;, a syndicated anthology of vintage radio shows. The release of the 1996 Rhino CD &quot;The United States of America Volume 1 (the Early Years)&quot; and &quot;Volume 2 (the Middle Years)&quot; suggested a possible third volume (which never happened). This set includes some parts written but cut because they would not fit on a record album.

He appeared on &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;, playing both the J.B. Toppersmith character and the voice of the puppet Papa Boolie. Yankovic has acknowledged Freberg as one of his greatest influences. Freberg is among the commentators in the special features on the multiple-volume DVD sets of the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; and narrates the documentary &quot;Irreverent Imagination&quot; on Volume 1.

Freberg was the announcer for the boat race in the film adaptation of &quot;Stuart Little&quot;, and in 2008 he guest starred as Sherlock Holmes in two episodes of &quot;The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd&quot;. From 2008 onwards, Freberg voiced numerous characters, including Doctor Whipple and Fluffykins, on &quot;The Garfield Show&quot;. He recorded his last voice-over role as the Mole for the episode &quot;Rodent Rebellion&quot; in 2014.

==Death==
Freberg died on April 7, 2015, aged 88, at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica in Santa Monica, California from pneumonia.

==In popular culture==

Films
* In 1961&#x27;s &quot;The Parent Trap,&quot; the characters during the animated opening title sequence refer to each other as John and Marsha.
* The 1968 film &quot;The Acid Eaters&quot; has a John and Marsha exchange. Marsha is played by Dianne Curtis.

Recordings
* In 2007, comedian the great Luke Ski recorded a 10-minute homage called &quot;MC Freberg&quot;, a parody illustrating what a Freberg-type satire of rap music would have sounded like. Originally recorded for &quot;The FuMP&quot;, the track also appears on Ski&#x27;s album &quot;BACONspiracy&quot;.

Television
* On the fourth season premiere of the TV series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) and Joey Baird (Matt Long) act out the &quot;John and Marsha&quot; comedy soap opera parody and repeatedly call each other John and Marsha.
* Warner Brothers cartoons (in which Freberg appeared, uncredited, as a voice artist) often had cameo appearances by couples named John and Marsha. In one case, the woman was an alien, making the couple John and Martian.
* Benny Hill did a video version of Freberg&#x27;s &quot;John and Marsha&quot; on his November 24, 1971 special, in the form of an art film parody titled &quot;The Lovers&quot;, with Benny as John, Jenny Lee-Wright as Marsha, and Henry McGee as a third character, George; the distinguishing visual factor being that the actors were photographed from the neck down.
* &quot;John and Marsha&quot; also is parodied in the &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; episode &quot;Yarnbenders&quot;.

<doc id="346860" wikidata="Q413254" url="?curid=346860" title="Ajwain">
<text>Ajwain or ajowan (&quot;Trachyspermum ammi&quot;) () —also known as ajowancaraway, 
thymol seeds, bishop&#x27;s weed, or carom—is an annual herb in the family Apiaceae. Both the leaves and the seed‑like fruit (often mistakenly called seeds) of the plant are consumed by humans. The name &quot;bishop&#x27;s weed&quot; also is a common name for other plants. The &quot;seed&quot; (i.e., the fruit) is often confused with lovage seed.

==Description==
Ajwain&#x27;s small, oval, seed-like fruits are pale brown schizocarps, which resemble the seeds of other plants in the family Apiaceae such as caraway, cumin and fennel. They have a bitter and pungent taste, with a flavor similar to anise and oregano. They smell like thyme because they also contain thymol, but they are more aromatic and less subtle in taste, as well as being somewhat bitter and pungent. Even a small number of fruits tend to dominate the flavor of a dish.

==Cultivation and production==
Ajwain grows in dry, barren soil in its indigenous regions of India, Iran, Afghanistan, and parts of northern Africa. Gujarat and Rajasthan are regions in India well-known for cultivating ajwain.

==Culinary uses==
The fruits are rarely eaten raw; they are commonly dry-roasted or fried in ghee (clarified butter). This allows the spice to develop a more subtle and complex aroma. It is widely used in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, often as part of a chaunk (also called a &quot;tarka&quot;), a mixture of spices – sometimes with a little chopped garlic or onion – fried in oil or clarified butter, which is used to flavor a dish at the end of cooking. In Afghanistan, the fruits are sprinkled over bread and biscuits.

Other applications of ajwain include incorporating the seeds in specific types of breads, such as naans and parathas. The seeds can also be used as a mouth freshener when mixed with lemon juice and black pepper, and then dried, or can be used as an ingredient in hot tea.

==In herbalism==
Ajwain is used in herbalism practices, such as Ayurveda, in the belief that it can treat various disorders. However, there is no good evidence that ajwain is effective as a therapy for treating any disease.

===Adverse effects===
Pregnant women should avoid ajwain due to potential adverse effects on fetal development, and its use is discouraged while breastfeeding. In high amounts taken orally, ajwain can result in fatal poisoning. People taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antiplatelet medications are susceptible to adverse effects from ajwain ingestion, as ajwain has anti-clotting activity of its own.

===Essential oil===
Hydrodistillation of ajwain fruits yields an essential oil consisting primarily of thymol, gamma-terpinene, p-cymene, and more than 20 trace compounds which are predominantly terpenoids.

<text>Basil (, ; , ; Ocimum basilicum (, )), also called great basil, is a culinary herb of the family Lamiaceae (mints). It is a tender plant, and is used in cuisines worldwide. In Western cuisine, the generic term &quot;basil&quot; refers to the variety also known as Genovese basil or sweet basil. Basil is native to tropical regions from Central Africa to Southeast Asia. In temperate climates basil is treated as an annual plant, but it can be grown as a short-lived perennial or biennial in warmer horticultural zones with tropical or Mediterranean climates.

There are many varieties of basil including sweet basil, Thai basil (&quot;O. basilicum&quot; var. &quot;thyrsiflora&quot;), and Mrs. Burns&#x27; Lemon (&quot;O.&quot;&quot;basilicum var. citriodora&quot;). &quot;O. basilicum&quot; can cross-pollinate with other species of the &quot;Ocimum&quot; genus, producing hybrids such as lemon basil (&quot;O. × citriodorum&quot;) and African blue basil (&quot;O. × kilimandscharicum&quot;).

== Description ==

Basil is an annual, or sometimes perennial, herb. Depending on the variety, plants can reach heights of between . Basil leaves are glossy and ovulate, with smooth or slightly toothed edges that typically cup slightly; the leaves are arranged oppositely along the square stems. Leaves may be green or purple. Its flowers are small and white, and grow from a central inflorescence, or spike, that emerges from the central stem atop the plant. Unusual among Lamiaceae, the four stamens and the pistil are not pushed under the upper lip of the corolla, but lie over the inferior lip. After entomophilous pollination, the corolla falls off and four round achenes develop inside the bilabiate calyx.

=== Phytochemistry ===
The various basils have such distinct scents because the volatile aromatic compounds vary with cultivars. The essential oil from European basil contains high concentrations of linalool and methyl chavicol (estragole), in a ratio of about 3:1. Other constituents include: 1,8-cineole, eugenol, and myrcene, among others. The clove scent of sweet basil is derived from eugenol. The aroma profile of basil includes 1,8-cineole and methyl eugenol. In this species eugenol is synthesised from coniferyl acetate and NADPH.

=== Similar species ===
Some similar species in the same genus may be commonly called &quot;basil&quot;, although they are not varieties of &quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot;.
* Camphor basil, African basil (&quot;O. kilimandscharicum&quot;)
* Clove basil, also African basil (&quot;Ocimum gratissimum&quot;)
* Holy basil (&quot;Ocimum tenuiflorum&quot;, formerly known as &quot;O. sanctum&quot;)

== Taxonomy ==

The exact taxonomy of basil is uncertain due to the immense number of cultivars, its ready polymorphy, and frequent cross-pollination (resulting in new hybrids) with other members of the genus &quot;Ocimum&quot; and within the species. &quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot; has at least 60 varieties, which further complicates taxonomy.

=== Cultivars ===

Most basils are cultivars of sweet basil. Most basil varieties have green leaves, but a few are purple, such as, &#x27;Purple Delight&#x27;.
* Anise basil, Licorice basil, or Persian basil (&quot;O. basilicum&quot; &#x27;Liquorice&#x27;)
* Cinnamon basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot; &#x27;Cinnamon&#x27;)
* Dark opal basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot; &#x27;Dark Opal&#x27;)
* Genovese basil or Sweet Basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot;)
* Greek basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum var. minimum&quot;)
* Globe basil, dwarf basil, French basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot; &#x27;Minimum&#x27;)
* Lettuce leaf basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot; &#x27;Crispum&#x27;)
* Napolitano basil, also known as Napoletano basil, Neapolitan basil, Mammoth basil, Bolloso Napoletano basil, Napolitano Mammoth-Leafed basil, or Italian Large-Leaf basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot;)
* Purple basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot; &#x27;Purpurescens&#x27;)
* Rubin basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum&quot; &#x27;Rubin&#x27;)
* Thai basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum thyrsifolium&quot;)

=== Hybrids ===
* African blue basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum × O. kilimandscharicum&quot;)
* Lemon basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum × O. americanum&quot;)
* Spice basil (&quot;Ocimum basilicum × O. americanum&quot;), which is sometimes sold as holy basil

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;basil&quot; comes from the Latin , and the Greek (), meaning &quot;royal/kingly plant&quot;, possibly because the plant was believed to have been used in production of royal perfumes. Basil is likewise sometimes referred to in French as (&#x27;the royal herb&#x27;). The Latin name has been confused with basilisk, as it was supposed to be an antidote to the basilisk&#x27;s venom.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Basil is native to India and other tropical regions stretching from Africa to South East Asia, but has now become globalized due to human cultivation.

== Cultivation ==
=== Growing conditions ===
Basil is sensitive to cold, with best growth in hot, dry conditions. It behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost. However, due to its popularity, basil is cultivated in many countries around the world. Production areas include countries in the Mediterranean area, those in the temperate zone, and others in subtropical climates.

In Northern Europe, Canada, the northern states of the U.S., and the South Island of New Zealand, basil grows best if sown under glass in a peat pot, then planted out in late spring/early summer (when there is little chance of a frost); however, it can also thrive when planted outside in these climates. Additionally, it may be sown in soil once chance of frost is past. It fares best in well-drained soil with direct exposure to the sun.

Although basil grows best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a sun-facing windowsill, kept away from extremely cold drafts. A greenhouse or row cover is ideal if available. It can, however, even be grown in a basement under fluorescent lights. Supplemental lighting produces greater biomass and phenol production, with red + blue specifically increasing growth and flower bud production. increases the volatiles in &quot;O. basilicum&quot; essential oil, which has not been reproducible in other plants, and so may be unique to the genus or even to this species.

Basil plants require regular watering, but not as much attention as is needed in other climates. If its leaves have wilted from lack of water, it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location. Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant has been stressed; usually this means that it needs less water, or less or more fertilizer. Basil can be propagated reliably from cuttings with the stems of short cuttings suspended in water for two weeks or until roots develop.

=== Pruning, flowering, and seeding ===
Once a stem produces flowers, foliage production stops on that stem, the stem becomes woody, and essential oil production declines. To prevent this, a basil-grower may pinch off any flower stems before they are fully mature. Because only the blooming stem is so affected, some stems can be pinched for leaf production, while others are left to bloom for decoration or seeds. Picking the leaves off the plant helps promote growth, largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems.

Once the plant is allowed to flower, it may produce seed pods containing small black seeds, which can be saved and planted the following year. If allowed to go to seed, a basil plant will grow back the next year.

=== Diseases ===
Basil suffers from several plant pathogens that can ruin the crop and reduce yield. Fusarium wilt is a soil-borne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants. Seedlings may be killed by &quot;Pythium&quot; damping off. A common foliar disease of basil is gray mold caused by &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;; it can cause infections post-harvest and is capable of killing the entire plant. Black spot can be seen on basil foliage and is caused by the fungi genus &quot;Colletotrichum&quot;. Downy mildew caused by &quot;Peronospora belbahrii&quot; is a significant disease, as first reported in Italy in 2003. It was reported in the Florida in 2007 and by 2008 had spread along the eastern United States, reaching Canada. Basil cultivars resistant to &quot;P. belbahrii&quot; have been developed.

Non-pathogenic bacteria found on basil include &quot;Novosphingobium&quot; species.

==Uses==

===Culinary===

Basil is most commonly used fresh in recipes. In general, it is added last, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept for a short time in plastic bags in the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being blanched quickly in boiling water.

==== Leaves and flowers ====
The most commonly used Mediterranean basil cultivars are &quot;Genovese&quot;, &quot;Purple Ruffles&quot;, &quot;Mammoth&quot;, &quot;Cinnamon&quot;, &quot;Lemon&quot;, &quot;Globe&quot;, and &quot;African Blue&quot;. Basil is one of the main ingredients in pesto, an Italian sauce with olive oil and basil as its primary ingredients. Many national cuisines use fresh or dried basils in soups and other foods, such as to thicken soups. Basil is commonly steeped in cream or milk to create flavor in ice cream or chocolate truffles.

Lemon basil has a strong lemony smell and flavor due to the presence of citral. It is widely used in Indonesia, where it is called and served raw as an accompaniment to meat or fish.

==== Seeds ====
When soaked in water, the seeds of several basil varieties become gelatinous, and are used in Asian drinks and desserts such as the Indian &quot;faluda&quot;, the Iranian , or . In Kashmir, the Ramadan fast is often broken with &quot;babre beole&quot;, a sharbat made with basil seeds.

=== Folk medicine ===
Basil is used in folk medicine practices, such as those of Ayurveda or traditional Chinese medicine.

=== Insecticide and insect repellent ===
Studies of the essential oil have shown insecticidal and insect-repelling properties, including potential toxicity to mosquitos. The essential oil is found by Huignard et al. 2008 to inhibit electrical activity by decreasing action potential amplitude, by shortening the post hyperpolarization phase, and reducing the action frequency of action potentials. In Huignard&#x27;s opinion this is due to the linalool and estragole, the amplitude reduction due to linalool, and the phase shortening due to both.

&quot;Callosobruchus maculatus&quot;, a pest which affects cowpea, is repelled by the essential oil. The essential oil mixed with kaolin is both an adulticide and an ovicide, effective for three months against &quot;C. maculatus&quot; in cowpea. The thrips &quot;Frankliniella occidentalis&quot; and &quot;Thrips tabaci&quot; are repelled by &quot;O. basilicum&quot;, making this useful as an insect repellent in other crops. The pests &quot;Sitophilus oryzae&quot;, &quot;Stegobium paniceum&quot;, &quot;Tribolium castaneum&quot;, and &quot;Bruchus chinensis&quot; are evaluated by Deshpande et al. 1974 and &#x27;77.

=== Nematicide ===
The essential oil is found by Malik et al. 1987 and Sangwan et al. 1990 to be nematicidal against &quot;Tylenchulus semipenetrans&quot;, &quot;Meloidogyne javanica&quot;, &quot;Anguina tritici&quot;, and &quot;Heterodera cajani&quot;.

=== Bacterial and fungal inhibition ===
The essential oil of the leaf and terminal shoot is effective against a large number of bacterial species including &quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; spp. The essential oil of the leaf and terminal shoot is also effective against a large number of fungal species including &quot;Aspergillus&quot; spp., &quot;Candida&quot; spp., &quot;Mucor&quot; spp., and &quot;Geotrichum candidum&quot;.

== In culture ==

=== Religion ===

There are many rituals and beliefs associated with basil. The ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks believed basil would open the gates of heaven for a person passing on. However, Herbalist Nicholas Culpeper saw basil as a plant of dread and suspicion.

In Portugal, dwarf bush basil is traditionally presented in a pot, together with a poem and a paper carnation, to a sweetheart, on the religious holidays of John the Baptist (see ) and Saint Anthony of Padua.

Basil has religious significance in the Greek Orthodox Church, where it is used to sprinkle holy water. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Serbian Orthodox Church, Macedonian Orthodox Church and Romanian Orthodox Church use basil (, ; , ; , ) to prepare holy water and pots of basil are often placed below church altars. Some Greek Orthodox Christians avoid eating it due to its association with the legend of the Elevation of the Holy Cross.

=== Art and literature ===
In Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s 14th century &quot;Decameron&quot;, the fifth story of the narrative&#x27;s fourth day involves a pot of basil as a central plot device. This famous story inspired John Keats to write his 1814 poem &quot;Isabella, or the Pot of Basil&quot;, which was in turn the inspiration for two paintings of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood: John Everett Millais&#x27;s &quot;Isabella&quot; in 1849 and in 1868 the &quot;Isabella and the Pot of Basil&quot; by William Holman Hunt.

<text>The Acrocephalus warblers are small, insectivorous passerine birds belonging to the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;. Formerly in the paraphyletic Old World warbler assemblage, they are now separated as the namesake of the marsh and tree warbler family Acrocephalidae. They are sometimes called marsh warblers or reed warblers, but this invites confusion with marsh warbler and reed warbler.

These are rather drab brownish warblers usually associated with marshes or other wetlands. Some are streaked, others plain. Many species breeding in temperate regions are migratory.

This genus has heavily diversified into many species throughout islands across the tropical Pacific. This in turn has led to many of the resulting insular endemic species to become endangered. Several of these species (including all but one of the species endemic to the Marianas and two endemic to French Polynesia) have already gone extinct.

The most enigmatic species of the genus, the large-billed reed warbler (&quot;A. orinus&quot;), was rediscovered in Thailand in March, 2006; it was found also in a remote corner of Afghanistan in the summer of 2009. Prior to these recent sightings, it had been found only once before, in 1867.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; was introduced in 1811 by the German naturalist Johann Andreas Naumann and his son Johann Friedrich Naumann. The type species was designated as &quot;Turdus arundinaceus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, by the English zoologist George Gray in 1840. This is the great reed warbler. Many species have a flat head profile, which gives rise to the genus name, &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; from Ancient Greek &quot;akros&quot;, &quot;highest&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;. It is possible that the Naumanns thought &quot;akros&quot; meant &quot;sharp-pointed&quot;.

==List of species in taxonomic order==

The genus contains 42 species of which 6 insular forms are now extinct:
* Basra reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus griseldis&quot;
* Cape Verde warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus brevipennis&quot;
* Greater swamp warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus rufescens&quot;
* Lesser swamp warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus gracilirostris&quot;
* Madagascar swamp warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus newtoni&quot;
* Seychelles warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus sechellensis&quot;
* Rodrigues warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus rodericanus&quot;
* Great reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus arundinaceus&quot;
* Oriental reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus orientalis&quot;
* Clamorous reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus stentoreus&quot;
* Australian reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus australis&quot;
* Millerbird, &quot;Acrocephalus familiaris&quot;
*† Nightingale reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus luscinius&quot;
* Saipan reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus hiwae&quot;
*† Aguiguan reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus nijoi&quot;
*† Pagan reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus yamashinae&quot;
*† Mangareva reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus astrolabii&quot;
* Nauru reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus rehsei&quot;
* Caroline reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus syrinx&quot;
* Bokikokiko, &quot;Acrocephalus aequinoctialis&quot;
* Northern Marquesan reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus percernis&quot;
* Tahiti reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus caffer&quot;
*† Moorea reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus longirostris&quot;
*† Garrett&#x27;s reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus musae&quot;
* Southern Marquesan reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus mendanae&quot;
* Tuamotu reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus atyphus&quot;
* Cook reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus kerearako&quot;
* Rimatara reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus rimitarae&quot;
* Henderson reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus taiti&quot;
* Pitcairn reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus vaughani&quot;
* Black-browed reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus bistrigiceps&quot;
* Moustached warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus melanopogon&quot;
* Aquatic warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus paludicola&quot;
* Sedge warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus schoenobaenus&quot;
* Speckled reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus sorghophilus&quot;
* Blunt-winged warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus concinens&quot;
* Manchurian reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus tangorum&quot; (sometimes included in &quot;A. agricola&quot;)
* Large-billed reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus orinus&quot;
* Paddyfield warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus agricola&quot;
* Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus dumetorum&quot;
* Common reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus scirpaceus&quot;
* Marsh warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus palustris&quot;

Fragmentary fossil remains from the Late Miocene (about 11 mya) of Rudabánya (NE Hungary) show some apomorphies typical of this genus. Given its rather early age (most Passerida genera are not known until the Pliocene), it is not too certain that it is correctly placed here, but it is highly likely to belong to the Acrocephalidae at the least.

<doc id="346882" wikidata="Q16512674" url="?curid=346882" title="Herero Wars">
<text>The Herero Wars were a series of colonial wars between the German Empire and the Herero people of German South West Africa (present-day Namibia). They took place between 1904 and 1908.

==Background==
===Pre-colonial South-West Africa===
The Hereros were cattle grazers, occupying most of central and northern South West Africa. Under the leadership of Jonker Afrikaner, who died in 1861, and then later under the leadership of Samuel Maharero, they had achieved supremacy over the Nama and Orlam peoples in a series of conflicts that had in their later stages, seen the extensive use of fire-arms obtained from European traders.

===German colonization===
In the early 1880s, the German statesman Otto von Bismarck, reversing his previous rejection of colonial acquisitions, decided on a policy of imperial expansion. In 1882 Bismarck gave permission to Adolf Lüderitz to obtain lands which Germany would bring within its &quot;protection&quot;, under the conditions that a port was established within the territories taken and that there was &quot;clear title&quot; to the land. Lüderitz bought the title to Angra Pequena (later renamed Lüderitz Bay) from Joseph Fredericks, a chief of the Oorlam people, in exchange for 200 rifles, 2,500 German marks, and some lead toy soldiers, and established a port there. Clarification of Germany&#x27;s title among the European powers took some time, as the British demurred in response to a German request to clarify the boundaries of their title, however in April 1884 Bismarck instructed the German consul in declare &quot;Lüderitzland&quot; (as Lüderitz&#x27;s holding in South-West Africa had become known) as under the &quot;protection&quot; of the German Reich. Lüderitz steadily spread Germany&#x27;s influence throughout the South-West African territory until by 1885 only one tribe within it – the Witboois – had not concluded some kind of arrangement with Germany.

Whilst Rhenish missionaries, traders, and other Europeans had been present in the territory since the 1830s, it was only with the advent of Germany&#x27;s claim to South-West Africa that German settlement of the territory began in earnest. By 1903 there were roughly 4,682 European settlers in the protectorate of whom nearly 3,000 were Germans, most of them in the towns of Lüderitz, Swakopmund, and Windhoek. The advent of large-scale German settlement also brought about changes in the treatment of the native Herero and Nama peoples by Europeans, with native people facing increased legal discrimination and expropriation of land for the use of European settlers.

==Rebellion==
In 1903, some of the Khoi and Herero tribes rose in revolt and about 120-150 German settlers were killed, with many victims of the uprising tortured and mutilated before death. Troops were sent from Germany to re-establish order but only dispersed the rebels, led by Chief Samuel Maharero. In a famous letter to Hendrik Witbooi, the Nama chief, Maharero sought to organize his rebellion against the Germans while building alliances with the other tribes, exclaiming &quot;Let us die fighting!&quot;
The Herero led a guerrilla campaign, conducting fast hit and run operations then melting back into the terrain they knew well, preventing the Germans from gaining an advantage with their modern artillery and machine-guns. However a conclusive battle was fought on 11 August 1904, at the Battle of Waterberg in the Waterberg Mountains. Chief Maharero believed his six to one advantage over the Germans would allow him to win in a final showdown. The Germans had time to bring forward their artillery and heavy weapons. Both sides took heavy losses, but the Herero were scattered and defeated.
In October 1904, General Lothar von Trotha issued orders to kill every male Herero and drive women and children into the desert. As soon as the news of this order reached Germany, it was repealed, but Trotha initially ignored Berlin. When the extermination order was finally suspended at the end of 1904, surviving tribesmen were herded into concentration camps, while others were transferred as slave labor to German businesses; many Herero died of overwork and malnutrition.

It took the Germans until 1908 to re-establish authority over the territory. By that time tens of thousands of Africans (estimates range from 34,000 to 110,000) had been either killed or died of thirst while fleeing. 65,000 of 80,000 Hereros and at least 10,000 of 20,000 Nama died as a result of the conflict.

At the height of the campaign, some 19,000 German troops were involved.

At about the same time, diamonds were discovered in the territory, which briefly greatly boosted its prosperity.

==Aftermath==
In 1915, during World War I, South African forces occupied it in the so-called South West Africa Campaign, and SW Africa officially became a mandate of South Africa in 1920.

On 16 August 2004, 100 years after the war, the German government officially apologised for the atrocities. &quot;We Germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by Germans at that time,&quot; said Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Germany&#x27;s development aid minister. In addition, she admitted that the massacres were equivalent to genocide.

Not until 2015 did the German government admit that the massacres were equivalent to genocide and again apologised in 2016. The Herero are suing the German government in a class action lawsuit. In 2021, Germany announced that they would repay Namibia €1.1 billion.

==In literature==
The Herero Wars and the massacres are both depicted in a chapter of the 1963 novel &quot;V.&quot; by Thomas Pynchon. The tragic story of the Herero and Nama Genocide also appears in Pynchon&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;.

The heavy toll of the Herero and Nama Genocide on individual lives and the fabric of Herero culture is seen in the 2013 historical novel &quot;Mama Namibia&quot; by Mari Serebrov.

The war and the massacres are both significantly featured in &quot;The Glamour of Prospecting&quot;, a contemporary account by Frederick Cornell of his attempts to prospect for diamonds in the region. In the book, he describes his first-hand accounts of witnessing the concentration camp on Shark Island amongst other aspects of the conflict.

<doc id="346883" wikidata="Q1428844" url="?curid=346883" title="IEEE 802.1X">
<text>IEEE 802.1X is an IEEE Standard for port-based network access control (PNAC). It is part of the IEEE 802.1 group of networking protocols. It provides an authentication mechanism to devices wishing to attach to a LAN or WLAN.

The standard directly addresses an attack technique called Hardware Addition where an attacker posing as a guest, customer or staff smuggles a hacking device into the building that they then plug into the network giving them full access. A notable example of the issue occurred in 2005 when a machine attached to Walmart&#x27;s network hacked thousands of their servers. 

IEEE 802.1X defines the encapsulation of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) over wired IEEE 802 networks and over 802.11 wireless networks, which is known as &quot;EAP over LAN&quot; or EAPOL. EAPOL was originally specified for IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, IEEE 802.5 Token Ring, and FDDI (ANSI X3T9.5/X3T12 and ISO 9314) in 802.1X-2001, but was extended to suit other IEEE 802 LAN technologies such as IEEE 802.11 wireless in 802.1X-2004. The EAPOL was also modified for use with IEEE 802.1AE (&quot;MACsec&quot;) and IEEE 802.1AR (Secure Device Identity, DevID) in 802.1X-2010 to support service identification and optional point to point encryption over the internal LAN segment. 802.1X is part of the logical link control (LLC) sublayer of the 802 reference model.

==Overview==

802.1X authentication involves three parties: a supplicant, an authenticator, and an authentication server. The supplicant is a client device (such as a laptop) that wishes to attach to the LAN/WLAN. The term &#x27;supplicant&#x27; is also used interchangeably to refer to the software running on the client that provides credentials to the authenticator. The authenticator is a network device that provides a data link between the client and the network and can allow or block network traffic between the two, such as an Ethernet switch or wireless access point; and the authentication server is typically a trusted server that can receive and respond to requests for network access, and can tell the authenticator if the connection is to be allowed, and various settings that should apply to that client&#x27;s connection or setting. Authentication servers typically run software supporting the RADIUS and EAP protocols. In some cases, the authentication server software may be running on the authenticator hardware.

The authenticator acts like a security guard to a protected network. The supplicant (i.e., client device) is not allowed access through the authenticator to the protected side of the network until the supplicant&#x27;s identity has been validated and authorized. With 802.1X port-based authentication, the supplicant must initially provide the required credentials to the authenticator - these will have been specified in advance by the network administrator and could include a user name/password or a permitted digital certificate. The authenticator forwards these credentials to the authentication server to decide whether access is to be granted. If the authentication server determines the credentials are valid, it informs the authenticator, which in turn allows the supplicant (client device) to access resources located on the protected side of the network.

==Protocol operation==
EAPOL operates over the data link layer, and in Ethernet II framing protocol has an EtherType value of 0x888E.

===Port entities===
802.1X-2001 defines two logical port entities for an authenticated port—the &quot;controlled port&quot; and the &quot;uncontrolled port&quot;. The controlled port is manipulated by the 802.1X PAE (Port Access Entity) to allow (in the authorized state) or prevent (in the unauthorized state) network traffic ingress and egress to/from the controlled port. The uncontrolled port is used by the 802.1X PAE to transmit and receive EAPOL frames.

802.1X-2004 defines the equivalent port entities for the supplicant; so a supplicant implementing 802.1X-2004 may prevent higher-level protocols from being used if it is not content that authentication has successfully completed. This is particularly useful when an EAP method providing mutual authentication is used, as the supplicant can prevent data leakage when connected to an unauthorized network.

===Typical authentication progression===
The typical authentication procedure consists of:

# Initialization On detection of a new supplicant, the port on the switch (authenticator) is enabled and set to the &quot;unauthorized&quot; state. In this state, only 802.1X traffic is allowed; other traffic, such as the Internet Protocol (and with that TCP and UDP), is dropped.
# Initiation To initiate authentication the authenticator will periodically transmit EAP-Request Identity frames to a special Layer 2 MAC address () on the local network segment. The supplicant listens at this address, and on receipt of the EAP-Request Identity frame, it responds with an EAP-Response Identity frame containing an identifier for the supplicant such as a User ID. The authenticator then encapsulates this Identity response in a RADIUS Access-Request packet and forwards it on to the authentication server. The supplicant may also initiate or restart authentication by sending an EAPOL-Start frame to the authenticator, which will then reply with an EAP-Request Identity frame.&quot;
# Negotiation &quot;(Technically EAP negotiation)&quot; The authentication server sends a reply (encapsulated in a RADIUS Access-Challenge packet) to the authenticator, containing an EAP Request specifying the EAP Method (The type of EAP based authentication it wishes the supplicant to perform). The authenticator encapsulates the EAP Request in an EAPOL frame and transmits it to the supplicant. At this point, the supplicant can start using the requested EAP Method, or do a NAK (&quot;Negative Acknowledgement&quot;) and respond with the EAP Methods it is willing to perform.
# Authentication If the authentication server and supplicant agree on an EAP Method, EAP Requests and Responses are sent between the supplicant and the authentication server (translated by the authenticator) until the authentication server responds with either an EAP-Success message (encapsulated in a RADIUS Access-Accept packet), or an EAP-Failure message (encapsulated in a RADIUS Access-Reject packet). If authentication is successful, the authenticator sets the port to the &quot;authorized&quot; state and normal traffic is allowed. If it is unsuccessful, the port remains in the &quot;unauthorized&quot; state. When the supplicant logs off, it sends an EAPOL-logoff message to the authenticator, the authenticator then sets the port to the &quot;unauthorized&quot; state, once again blocking all non-EAP traffic.

==Implementations==

An open-source project named Open1X produces a client, Xsupplicant. This client is currently available for both Linux and Windows. The main drawbacks of the Open1X client are that it does not provide comprehensible and extensive user documentation and that most Linux vendors do not provide a package for it. The more general wpa_supplicant can be used for 802.11 wireless networks and wired networks. Both support a very wide range of EAP types.

The iPhone and iPod Touch support 802.1X since the release of iOS 2.0.
Android has support for 802.1X since the release of 1.6 Donut.
ChromeOS has supported 802.1X since mid-2011.

macOS has offered native support since 10.3.

Avenda Systems provides a supplicant for Windows, Linux and macOS. They also have a plugin for the Microsoft NAP framework. Avenda also offers health checking agents.

=== Windows ===

Windows defaults to not responding to 802.1X authentication requests for 20 minutes after a failed authentication. This can cause significant disruption to clients.

The block period can be configured using the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\dot3svc\BlockTime DWORD value (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\wlansvc\BlockTime for wireless networks) in the registry (entered in minutes). A hotfix is required for Windows XP SP3 and Windows Vista SP2 to make the period configurable.

Wildcard server certificates are not supported by EAPHost, the Windows component that provides EAP support in the operating system. The implication of this is that when using a commercial certification authority, individual certificates must be purchased.

==== Windows XP ====

Windows XP has major issues with its handling of IP address changes resulting from user-based 802.1X authentication that changes the VLAN and thus subnet of clients. Microsoft has stated that it will not backport the SSO feature from Vista that resolves these issues.

If users are not logging in with roaming profiles, a hotfix must be downloaded and installed if authenticating via PEAP with PEAP-MSCHAPv2.

==== Windows Vista ====

Windows Vista-based computers that are connected via an IP phone may not authenticate as expected and, as a result, the client can be placed into the wrong VLAN. A hotfix is available to correct this.

==== Windows 7 ====

Windows 7 based computers that are connected via an IP phone may not authenticate as expected and, consequently, the client can be placed into the wrong VLAN. A hotfix is available to correct this.

Windows 7 does not respond to 802.1X authentication requests after initial 802.1X authentication fails. This can cause significant disruption to clients. A hotfix is available to correct this.

==== Windows PE ====

Windows PE does not have native support for 802.1X. However, support can be added to WinPE 2.1 and WinPE 3.0 through hotfixes that are available from Microsoft. Although full documentation is not yet available, preliminary documentation for the use of these hotfixes is available via a Microsoft blog.

=== Linux ===

Most Linux distributions support 802.1X via wpa_supplicant and desktop integration like NetworkManager.

=== Apple devices ===
As of iOS 17 and macOS 14, Apple devices support connecting to 802.1X networks using EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 (EAP-TLS 1.3). Additionally, devices running iOS/iPadOS/tvOS 17 or later support wired 802.1X networks.

===Federations===
eduroam (the international roaming service), mandates the use of 802.1X authentication when providing network access to guests visiting from other eduroam-enabled institutions.

BT (British Telecom, PLC) employs Identity Federation for authentication in services delivered to a wide variety of industries and governments.

== Proprietary extensions ==

=== MAB (MAC Authentication Bypass) ===
Not all devices support 802.1X authentication. Examples include network printers, Ethernet-based electronics like environmental sensors, cameras, and wireless phones. For those devices to be used in a protected network environment, alternative mechanisms must be provided to authenticate them.

One option would be to disable 802.1X on that port, but that leaves that port unprotected and open for abuse. Another slightly more reliable option is to use the MAB option. When MAB is configured on a port, that port will first try to check if the connected device is 802.1X compliant, and if no reaction is received from the connected device, it will try to authenticate with the AAA server using the connected device&#x27;s MAC address as username and password. The network administrator then must make provisions on the RADIUS server to authenticate those MAC addresses, either by adding them as regular users or implementing additional logic to resolve them in a network inventory database.

Many managed Ethernet switches offer options for this.

==Vulnerabilities in 802.1X-2001 and 802.1X-2004==

===Shared media===
In the summer of 2005, Microsoft&#x27;s Steve Riley posted an article (based on the original research of Microsoft MVP Svyatoslav Pidgorny) detailing a serious vulnerability in the 802.1X protocol, involving a man in the middle attack. In summary, the flaw stems from the fact that 802.1X authenticates only at the beginning of the connection, but after that authentication, it&#x27;s possible for an attacker to use the authenticated port if they have the ability to physically insert themselves (perhaps using a workgroup hub) between the authenticated computer and the port. Riley suggests that for wired networks the use of IPsec or a combination of IPsec and 802.1X would be more secure.

EAPOL-Logoff frames transmitted by the 802.1X supplicant are sent in the clear and contain no data derived from the credential exchange that initially authenticated the client. They are therefore trivially easy to spoof on shared media and can be used as part of a targeted DoS on both wired and wireless LANs. In an EAPOL-Logoff attack a malicious third party, with access to the medium the authenticator is attached to, repeatedly sends forged EAPOL-Logoff frames from the target device&#x27;s MAC Address. The authenticator (believing that the targeted device wishes to end its authentication session) closes the target&#x27;s authentication session, blocking traffic ingressing from the target, denying it access to the network.

The 802.1X-2010 specification, which began as 802.1af, addresses vulnerabilities in previous 802.1X specifications, by using MACsec IEEE 802.1AE to encrypt data between logical ports (running on top of a physical port) and IEEE 802.1AR (Secure Device Identity / DevID) authenticated devices.

As a stopgap, until these enhancements are widely implemented, some vendors have extended the 802.1X-2001 and 802.1X-2004 protocol, allowing multiple concurrent authentication sessions to occur on a single port. While this prevents traffic from devices with unauthenticated MAC addresses ingressing on an 802.1X authenticated port, it will not stop a malicious device snooping on traffic from an authenticated device and provides no protection against MAC spoofing, or EAPOL-Logoff attacks.

== Alternatives ==
The IETF-backed alternative is the Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA), which also carries EAP, although it works at layer 3, using UDP, thus not being tied to the 802 infrastructure.

<doc id="346887" wikidata="Q159080" url="?curid=346887" title="Common reed warbler">
<text>The common reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) is an Old World warbler in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;. It breeds across Europe into the temperate western Palaearctic where it is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. It is also a resident species over large parts of Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The common reed warbler was formally described in 1804 by the French naturalist Johann Hermann under the binomial name &quot;Turdus scirpaceus&quot;. The type locality is Alsace. The common reed warbler is now one of around 40 species placed in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; that was introduced by Johann Andreas Naumann and his son Johann Friedrich Naumann in 1811. The genus name &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;akros&quot;, &quot;highest&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;. It is possible that the Naumanns thought &quot;akros&quot; meant &quot;sharp-pointed&quot;. The specific &quot;scirpaceus&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;reed&quot;.

Ten subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. s. scirpaceus&quot; (Hermann, 1804) – breeds in Europe to west Russia, Ukraine and west Turkey, northwest Africa, winters in west, central Africa
* &quot;A. s. fuscus&quot; (Hemprich &amp; Ehrenberg, 1833) – breeds in north Egypt and central Turkey through the Middle East to southeast European Russia, north Iran, Kazakhstan and northwest China; winters in eastern and southern Africa
* &quot;A. s. avicenniae&quot; Ash, Pearson, DJ, Nikolaus &amp; Colston, 1989 – coasts of the Red Sea 
* &quot;A. s. ammon&quot; Hering, Winkler &amp; Steinheimer, 2016 – Oases along the Libya-Egypt border region
* &quot;A. s. ambiguus&quot; (Brehm, AE, 1857) – Iberian Peninsula and northwest Africa 
* &quot;A. s. minor&quot; Lynes, 1923 – Sahel region from Senegal to west-central Sudan (Darfur) 
* &quot;A. s. cinnamomeus&quot; Reichenow, 1908 – west Ethiopia and south Somalia south through South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia and Mozambique; patchy distribution in west Africa from south Cameroon to possibly Niger and Mali 
* &quot;A. s. suahelicus&quot; Grote, 1926 – east Tanzania to east Mozambique and eastern South Africa 
* &quot;A. s. hallae&quot; White, CMN, 1960 – southwest Angola to southwest Zambia and south to western South Africa 
* &quot;A. s. baeticatus&quot; (Vieillot, 1817) – north Botswana and Zimbabwe to southern South Africa

An older scientific name for the reed warbler was &quot;Acrocephalus streperus&quot; (Vieill.).

The mostly resident Iberian and African subspecies are sometimes treated as a separate species, the African reed warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus baeticatus&quot;).

==Description==
This is a medium-sized warbler, in length with a wing-span of . The adult has an unstreaked brown back and buff underparts. The forehead is flattened, and the bill is strong and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are richer buff below. The common reed warbler looks similar to the great reed warbler, but the great reed warbler is larger in size and has a stronger supercilium.

The song is a slow, chattering &quot;jit-jit-jit&quot; with typically acrocephaline whistles and mimicry added.
==Distribution and habitat==
This small passerine bird is a species found almost exclusively in reed beds, usually with some bushes. They can also be found in damp scrub.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
Like most warblers, it is insectivorous, but will occasionally take plant material such as berries.

===Breeding===
The males return to the breeding grounds two or three weeks before the females. The species is usually monogamous. The first eggs are laid at the end of April. The nest is usually placed in vegetation over water, especially in reeds of the genus &quot;Phragmites&quot;. The deep cylindrical cup nest is sited on average —range is between —above the surface of the water and is built entirely by the female. She takes four days to build the initial cup of grass, reed stems and leaves, and another three days to complete the lining of finer material including hair. The clutch contains three to five eggs that are laid daily. The eggs are very pale green with speckles and blotches of olive green or grey. On average they measure and weigh . They are incubated by both parents, beginning after the penultimate egg is laid. Only the female incubates at night. The eggs hatch after 9–12 days. The nestlings are fed and cared for by both parents. They fledge after 10–12 days but continue to be fed by their parents for another 10–14 days. Up to one third of pairs raise a second brood.

The common reed warbler is one of the species that are brood parasitised by the common cuckoo.

<text>In botany, a tendril is a specialized stem, leaf or petiole with a thread-like shape used by climbing plants for support and attachment, as well as cellular invasion by parasitic plants such as &quot;Cuscuta&quot;. There are many plants that have tendrils; including sweet peas, passionflower, grapes and the Chilean glory-flower. Tendrils respond to touch and to chemical factors by curling, twining, or adhering to suitable structures or hosts. Tendrils vary greatly in size from a few centimeters up to 27 inches (69 centimeters) for &quot;Nepenthes harryana&quot;. The chestnut vine (&quot;Tetrastigma voinierianum&quot;) can have tendrils up to 20.5 inches (52 centimeters) in length. Normally there is only one simple or branched tendril at each node (see plant stem), but the aardvark cucumber (&quot;Cucumis humifructus&quot;) can have as many as eight.

== History ==
The earliest and most comprehensive study of tendrils was Charles Darwin&#x27;s monograph &quot;On the Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants&quot;, which was originally published in 1865. This work also coined the term circumnutation to describe the motion of growing stems and tendrils seeking supports. Darwin also observed the phenomenon now known as tendril perversion, in which tendrils adopt the shape of two sections of counter-twisted helices with a transition in the middle.

== Biology of tendrils ==
In the garden pea, it is only the terminal leaflets that are modified to become tendrils. In other plants such as the yellow vetch (&quot;Lathyrus aphaca&quot;), the whole leaf is modified to become tendrils while the stipules become enlarged and carry out photosynthesis. Still others use the rachis of a compound leaf as a tendril, such as members of the genus &quot;Clematis&quot;.

The specialised pitcher traps of &quot;Nepenthes&quot; plants form on the end of tendrils. The tendrils of aerial pitchers are usually coiled in the middle. If the tendril comes into contact with an object for long enough it will usually curl around it, forming a strong anchor point for the pitcher. In this way, the tendrils help to support the growing stem of the plant. Tendrils of &quot;Cuscuta&quot;, a parasitic plant, are guided by airborne chemicals, and only twine around suitable hosts.

=== Evolution and species ===
Climbing habits in plants support themselves to reach the canopy in order to receive more sunlight resources and increase the diversification in flowering plants. Tendril is a plant organ that is derived from various morphological structures such as stems, leaves and inflorescences. Even though climbing habits are involved in the angiosperms, gymnosperms, and fern, tendrils are often shown in angiosperms and little in fern. Based on their molecular basis of tendril development, studies showed that tendrils helical growth performance is not correlated with ontogenetic origin, instead, there are multiple ontogenetic origins. 17 types of tendrils have been identified by their ontogenetic origins and growth pattern, and each type of tendril can be involved more than once within angiosperms. Common fruits and vegetables that have tendrils includes watermelon (&quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot;)&#x27;s derived from modified stem, pea (&quot;Pisum sativum&quot;)&#x27;s derived from modified terminal leaflets and common grape vine (&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;)&#x27;s is modified from whole inflorescence.

== Coiling mechanism ==
=== Circumnutation ===
The mechanism of tendril coiling begins with circumnutation of the tendril in which it is moving and growing in a circular oscillatory pattern around its axis. Circumnutation is often defined as the first main movement of the tendril, and it serves the purpose of increasing the chance that the plant will come in contact with a support system (physical structure for the tendril to coil around). In a 2019 study done by Guerra et al., it was shown that without a support stimulus, in this case a stake in the ground, the tendrils will circumnutate towards a light stimulus. After many attempts to reach a support structure, the tendril will eventually fall to the ground. However, it was found that when a support stimulus is present, the tendril’s circumnutation oscillation occurs in the direction of the support stimulus. Therefore, it was concluded that tendrils are able to change the direction of their circumnutation based on the presence of a support stimulus. The process of circumnutation in plants is not unique to tendril plants, as almost all plant species show circumnutation behaviors.

=== Contact coiling ===
Thigmotropism is the basis of the input signal in the tendril coiling mechanism. For example, pea tendrils have highly sensitive cells in the surfaces of cell walls that are exposed. These sensitized cells are the ones that initiate the thigmotropic signal, typically as a calcium wave. The primary touch signal induces a signaling cascade of other phytohormones, most notably gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Jasmonate (JA). In grapevine tendrils, it recently has been shown that GABA can independently promote tendril coiling. It has also been shown that jasmonate phytohormones serve as a hormonal signal to initiate tendril coiling. This cascade can activate plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which also plays a role in the contact coiling mechanism as a proton pump. This pump activity establishes an electrochemical of H+ ions from inside the cell to the apoplast, which in turn creates an osmotic gradient. This leads to loss of turgor pressure; the differences in cell size due to the loss of turgor pressure in some cells creates the coiling response. This contractile movement is also influenced by gelatinous fibers, which contract and lignify in response to the thigmotropic signal cascade.

=== Self-discrimination ===
Although tendrils twine around hosts based on touch perception, plants have a form of self-discrimination and avoid twining around themselves or neighboring plants of the same speciesdemonstrating chemotropism based on chemoreception. Once a tendril comes in contact with a neighboring conspecific plant (of the same species) signaling molecules released by the host plant bind to chemoreceptors on the climbing plant’s tendrils. This generates a signal that prevents the thigmotropic pathway and therefore prevents the tendril from coiling around that host.

Studies confirming this pathway have been performed on the climbing plant &quot;Cayratia japonica&quot;. Research demonstrated that when two &quot;C. japonica&quot; plants were placed in physical contact, the tendrils would not coil around the conspecific plant. Researchers tested this interaction by isolating oxalate crystals from the leaves of a &quot;C. japonica&quot; plant and coating a stick with the oxalate crystals. The tendrils of &quot;C. japonica&quot; plants that came in physical contact with the oxalate-coated stick would not coil, confirming that climbing plants use chemoreception for self-discrimination.

Self-discrimination may confer an evolutionary advantage for climbing plants to avoid coiling around conspecific plants. This is because neighboring climbing plants do not provide as stable of structures to coil around when compared to more rigid nearby plants. Furthermore, by being able to recognize and avoid coiling around conspecific plants, the plants reduce their proximity to competition, allowing them to have access to more resources and therefore better growth.

<text>The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC, pronounced – rhymes with &quot;oink&quot;) is an open-source middleware system for volunteer computing (a type of distributed computing). Developed originally to support SETI@home, it became the platform for many other applications in areas as diverse as medicine, molecular biology, mathematics, linguistics, climatology, environmental science, and astrophysics, among others. The purpose of BOINC is to enable researchers to utilize processing resources of personal computers and other devices around the world.

BOINC development began with a group based at the Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) at the University of California, Berkeley, and led by David P. Anderson, who also led SETI@home. As a high-performance volunteer computing platform, BOINC brings together 34,236 active participants employing 136,341 active computers (hosts) worldwide, processing daily on average 20.164 PetaFLOPS (it would be the 21st largest processing capability in the world compared with an individual supercomputer). The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds BOINC through awards SCI/0221529, SCI/0438443 and SCI/0721124. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; ranks BOINC as the largest computing grid in the world.

BOINC code runs on various operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, Android, Linux, and FreeBSD. BOINC is free software released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

==History==
BOINC was originally developed to manage the SETI@home project. David P. Anderson has said that he chose its name because he wanted something that was not &quot;imposing&quot;, but rather &quot;light, catchy, and maybe - like &#x27;Unix&#x27; - a little risqué&quot;, so he &quot;played around with various acronyms and settled on &#x27;BOINC&#x27;&quot;.

The original SETI client was a non-BOINC software exclusively for SETI@home. It was one of the first volunteer computing projects, and not designed with a high level of security. As a result, some participants in the project attempted to cheat the project to gain &quot;credits&quot;, while others submitted entirely falsified work. BOINC was designed, in part, to combat these security breaches.

The BOINC project started in February 2002, and its first version was released on April 10, 2002. The first BOINC-based project was Predictor@home, launched on June 9, 2004. In 2009, AQUA@home deployed multi-threaded CPU applications for the first time, followed by the first OpenCL application in 2010.

As of 15 August 2022, there are 33 projects on the official list. There are also, however, BOINC projects not included on the official list. Each year, an international BOINC Workshop is hosted to increase collaboration among project administrators. In 2021, the workshop was hosted virtually.

While not affiliated with BOINC officially, there have been several independent projects that reward BOINC users for their participation, including Charity Engine (sweepstakes based on processing power with prizes funded by private entities who purchase computational time of CE users), Bitcoin Utopia (now defunct), and Gridcoin (a blockchain which mints coins based on processing power).

==Design and structure==
BOINC is software that can exploit the unused CPU and GPU cycles on computer hardware to perform scientific computing. In 2008, BOINC&#x27;s website announced that Nvidia had developed a language called CUDA that uses GPUs for scientific computing. With NVIDIA&#x27;s assistance, several BOINC-based projects (e.g., MilkyWay@home. SETI@home) developed applications that run on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. BOINC added support for the ATI/AMD family of GPUs in October 2009. The GPU applications run from 2 to 10 times faster than the former CPU-only versions. GPU support (via OpenCL) was added for computers using macOS with AMD Radeon graphic cards, with the current BOINC client supporting OpenCL on Windows, Linux, and macOS. GPU support is also provided for Intel GPUs.

BOINC consists of a server system and client software that communicate to process and distribute work units and return results.

===Mobile application===
A BOINC app also exists for Android, allowing every person owning an Android device – smartphone, tablet and/or Kindle – to share their unused computing power. The user is allowed to select the research projects they want to support, if it is in the app&#x27;s available project list.

By default, the application will allow computing only when the device is connected to a WiFi network, is being charged, and the battery has a charge of at least 90%. Some of these settings can be changed to users needs. Not all BOINC projects are available and some of the projects are not compatible with all versions of Android operating system or availability of work is intermittent. Currently available projects are Asteroids@home, Einstein@Home, LHC@home, Moo! Wrapper, Rosetta@home, World Community Grid and . As of September 2021, the most recent version of the mobile application can only be downloaded from the BOINC website or the F-Droid repository as the official Google Play store does not allow downloading and running executables not signed by the app developer and each BOINC project has their own executable files.

===User interfaces===
BOINC can be controlled remotely by remote procedure calls (RPC), from the command line, and from a BOINC Manager. BOINC Manager currently has two &quot;views&quot;: the &quot;Advanced View&quot; and the &quot;Simplified GUI&quot;. The &quot;Grid View&quot; was removed in the 6.6.x clients as it was redundant. The appearance (skin) of the Simplified GUI is user-customizable, in that users can create their own designs.

===Account managers===
A BOINC Account Manager is an application that manages multiple BOINC project accounts across multiple computers (CPUs) and operating systems. Account managers were designed for people who are new to BOINC or have several computers participating in several projects. The account manager concept was conceived and developed jointly by GridRepublic and BOINC. Current and past account managers include:
* BAM! (BOINC Account Manager) (The first publicly available Account Manager, released for public use on May 30, 2006)
* GridRepublic (Follows the ideas of simplicity and neatness in account management)
* Charity Engine (Non-profit account manager for hire, uses prize draws and continuous charity fundraising to motivate people to join the grid)
* Science United (An account manager designed to make BOINC easier to use which automatically selects vetted BOINC projects for users based on desired research areas such as &quot;medicine&quot; or &quot;physics&quot;)
* Dazzler (Open-source Account Manager, to ease institutional management resources)

===Credit system===
* The BOINC Credit System is designed to avoid bad hardware and cheating by validating results before granting credit.
* The credit management system helps to ensure that users are returning results which are both statistically and scientifically accurate.
* Online volunteer computing is a complicated and variable mix of long-term users, retiring users and new users with different personal aspirations.

==Projects==
BOINC is used by many groups and individuals. Some BOINC projects are based at universities and research labs while others are independent areas of research or interest.

<text>Tagaytay (), officially the City of Tagaytay (), is a component city in the province of Cavite, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 85,330 people.

It is one of the country&#x27;s most popular destinations for domestic tourism because of its scenery and cooler climate provided by its elevation. Tagaytay overlooks Taal Lake in Batangas and provides views of Taal Volcano Island in the middle of the lake through various vantage points situated in the city.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tagaytay&quot; is derived from the Tagalog words &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;, which mean &quot;mountain ridge&quot; or &quot;low mountain range&quot;, in reference to the Tagaytay Ridge on which the city sits.

==History==

===Philippine Revolution===
During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the ridges and forests of Tagaytay became a sanctuary for revolutionaries including those from nearby provinces. The passage to and from towns via Tagaytay added the word &quot;mananagaytay&quot; to the native&#x27;s vocabulary. It means &quot;to traverse ridges.&quot;

===Cityhood===

Tagaytay became a chartered city with the passing and signing of Commonwealth Act No. 338 by President Manuel L. Quezon on June 21, 1938, as authored by Representative Justiniano Montano of Cavite. To form the newly founded city, areas of the towns of Silang, Mendez, Indang, and Amadeo were removed from their town governments, making it the first planned community in the province and the first city to be built from scratch, given the ongoing highway works in the area then.

===Territorial changes===
On April 1, 1941, portions of Talisay, Batangas and Alfonso, Cavite were ceded to Tagaytay through Executive Order No. 336 signed by President Quezon to expand its territory. However, on June 7, 1956, the lakeside barangays of Birinayan (Berinayan) and Caloocan on the shores of Taal Lake were returned to Talisay. Berinayan later became part of Laurel when the municipality was established in 1969.

===World War II===

On February 3, 1945, the 11th Airborne Division of Lt. Gen. Robert L. Eichelberger&#x27;s 8th Army performed a combat jump of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment and associated elements on Tagaytay ridge, with a drop zone around the Manila Hotel Annex, which had been cleared of Japanese forces by the Fil-American Cavite Guerilla Forces of General Mariano Castaneda, After the fall of Bataan and Corregidor, the Fil-American Cavite Guerilla Force resisted the Japanese occupation forces and were instrumental in clearing the landing zone of the 11th Airborne Division . To commemorate this event, a marker was installed in 1951 at the junction of Silang, Canlubang-Nasugbu roads by the city officials in coordination with the National Historical Institute of the Philippines.

Tagaytay&#x27;s built-up areas including the urban center are situated in the relatively level top of the caldera rim, but beyond the edge are deep ravines that drop steeply to Taal Lake. The portions adjoining the municipalities of Mendez, Indang, Amadeo, Silang, and Alfonso are level to nearly level areas interspersed with very gently sloping surfaces. Across the southern edge of the lake on the opposite side of the city is Mount Macolod, the highest point of the Taal Caldera rim.

The soil contains rich volcanic components suitable to farming. The main agricultural goods produced are pineapple, coffee, banana, root crops, cacao, camote, cassava, other fruits and vegetables, and cut flowers which are supplied to both local and international markets. Garden plant shops thrive along Tagaytay–Calamba Road. The city was once a daisy and gladiola farming haven prior to tourism development and a residential boom.

===Tourism===

Tagaytay is considered to be the second summer capital of the Philippines with the first being Baguio due to its cool climate and, thus, is a favored destination for those seeking more temperate areas of the Philippines. Tagaytay is also a destination for tourists seeking views of Taal Volcano and the surrounding lake. In 2015, the Department of Tourism cited Tagaytay as the top tourist destination in the Calabarzon region. Among the most visited sites in Tagaytay are Sky Ranch, Ayala Malls Serin, Robinsons Summit Ridge (Robinsons Tagaytay), Picnic Grove Complex, People&#x27;s Park in the Sky, Halfway Zoo, and numerous restaurants known for serving the famous &quot;bulalo&quot; and crispy &quot;tawilis&quot;. Fresh beef and vegetables are sold at Mahogany Market. Tagaytay City Market contains many fruit and vegetable stands as well as fresh &quot;tilapia&quot; from Taal Lake. Tagaytay&#x27;s proximity to Metro Manila accounts for the high level of tourism in the city. Tagaytay receives a seasonal influx of tourists during Christmas season and Holy Week, and the city is a pilgrimage destination with many churches, shrines, and retreat houses. The Taal Vista Hotel is a symbol of Tagaytay&#x27;s past.

==Transportation==

===Roads===

Tagaytay is linked by national highways to the Metro Manila area and to the provinces of Batangas and Laguna. Secondary roads link the city with the adjoining municipalities of Amadeo, Mendez, Indang, Silang, and Alfonso in Cavite towards the northwest, to the cities of Calamba, Cabuyao, and Santa Rosa in Laguna to the northeast, and the town of Talisay in Batangas to the south.

The South Luzon Expressway serves the city via Tagaytay–Santa Rosa Road that passes Santa Rosa and Silang from Santa Rosa and Eton City Exits, and Tagaytay-Calamba Road that traverses Calamba Premiere International Park from Batino Exit, albeit discontinuously for the public previously due to the Tagaytay Highlands right of way. Governor&#x27;s Drive and Pala-Pala Road in Dasmariñas from Carmona Exit, and Cavite–Laguna Expressway (CALAX) through its Silang–Aguinaldo Exit in Silang are the other alternative routes to the city, as those roads intersect with the Aguinaldo Highway, which ends in Tagaytay. The Manila-Cavite Expressway (CAVITEx, formerly Coastal Road) also serves Tagaytay via Aguinaldo Highway. 

From Batangas, the main route to Tagaytay is either Tagaytay–Nasugbu Highway, a major thoroughfare from Tagaytay Rotonda to Nasugbu, Ligaya Drive, a winding road that starts near the poblacion of Talisay and ends near Tagaytay Picnic Grove, or Tagaytay–Talisay Road, a road from Lemery–Agoncillo–Laurel–Talisay Road to Tagaytay Rotunda. From Laguna, the main route is Tagaytay–Santa Rosa Road from Santa Rosa, Laguna; another route is Tagaytay–Calamba Road (via Tagaytay Highlands and a future link to Calamba) from Calamba, Laguna. Mahogany Avenue also serves as the alternative route of the Tagaytay–Nasugbu Highway within Tagaytay city proper.

To decongest traffic on the aforementioned major roads in Tagaytay, the partially opened Tagaytay Bypass Road and the proposed Cavite–Tagaytay–Batangas Expressway (CTBEX) were laid out to traverse parallel to the Tagaytay–Nasugbu Highway. CTBEX will connect with the CALAX in Silang to Nasugbu, Batangas.

<doc id="346905" wikidata="Q9354" url="?curid=346905" title="Gianfranco Zola">
<text>Gianfranco Zola (; born 5 July 1966) is an Italian football executive, manager, and former footballer who played predominantly as a forward. He is currently vice-president of the &quot;Lega Pro&quot;, the Italian Serie C football league.

He spent the first decade of his playing career in Italy, most notably with Napoli alongside Diego Maradona and Careca where he won the 1989–90 Serie A title, and at Parma where he won the Italian Super Cup and the 1994–95 UEFA Cup. He later moved to English side Chelsea, where he was voted the Football Writers&#x27; Player of the Year in the 1996–97 season. During his time at the club, he won the 1997–98 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, two FA Cups, the League Cup, and the Community Shield. In 2003 he was voted the greatest Chelsea player ever. He was capped 35 times for Italy from his debut in 1991, appearing at the 1994 World Cup, where Italy finished in second place, and Euro 1996.

After a stint with Italy under-21s, Zola began his club managerial career with West Ham United of the Premier League in 2008, before being sacked in 2010. He was manager of Watford from July 2012 until he announced his resignation on 16 December 2013. From December 2014 to March 2015 he managed Cagliari in Serie A. He returned to Chelsea as the assistant of new manager Maurizio Sarri on 18 July 2018, ahead of the 2018–19 Premier League season.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Oliena, Zola signed his first professional contract with Sardinian team Nuorese in 1984. In 1986, he moved to the Sassari-based team Torres, where he spent three seasons.

===Napoli===
He was noticed by Luciano Moggi in Serie C1 in 1989, he signed for Napoli in Serie A for ₤2 million, making his debut that year. The young and talented Zola scored two goals as understudy to Diego Maradona as Napoli won the Serie A title in 1990, the only league title of Zola&#x27;s career. Zola scored his first goal against Atalanta, whilst his second goal was scored against Genoa, during injury time, which allowed Napoli to win 2–1 and maintain a two-point lead over Milan, who were Napoli&#x27;s main title contenders, in second place. Zola was excited by the transfer, and he developed an important friendship with Maradona, who commented &quot;Finally they have bought someone shorter than me!&quot; Maradona would prove to be a big influence on Zola&#x27;s career. The two would spend hours practising free kicks together after training and Zola later said that &quot;I learned everything from Diego. I used to spy on him every time he trained and learned how to curl a free-kick just like him.&quot;

Zola helped Napoli to win the Italian Super Cup in 1990, partnering alongside Careca following Maradona&#x27;s drug ban during the second part of the 1990–91 season, as Napoli finished in a disappointing seventh place. Due to his individual performances, however, Zola was given his debut for the Italy national team under coach Arrigo Sacchi in 1991, winning his first cap against Norway in November. He temporarily inherited Maradona&#x27;s number 10 shirt the following season under manager Claudio Ranieri, after Maradona parted ways with the club due to his ban, scoring 12 goals in 34 appearances. Upon his departure, Maradona had recommended that the Napoli management focus on Zola&#x27;s development, stating: &quot;Napoli doesn&#x27;t need to look for anyone to replace me, the team already has Zola!&quot;. In his final season with the club, he managed 12 goals in 33 league appearances, and he also finished the 1992–93 Serie A season as the joint top assist provider in the league, with 12 assists, alongside Francesco Baiano.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy Championship 1992/93&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Napoli, Zola scored a total of 32 goals in 105 appearances.

===Parma===
In 1993, Zola left Napoli and joined fellow Serie A side Parma for ₤13 million, due to the poor economic situation of the Neapolitan club. He was initially accused of betraying the club by the fans, although Zola denied this, noting that Corrado Ferlaino had also been forced to sell other important Napoli players such as Jonas Thern, Ciro Ferrara and Daniel Fonseca, in order to overcome the club&#x27;s debts. With Parma, he established himself as one of the league&#x27;s top players, and he achieved notable domestic and European success; he came close to winning another Serie A title, in particular during the 1994–95 season, in which he scored 19 goals in a close fought title-race with rivals Juventus, although he ultimately failed to do so. In his first season, he scored 18 league goals, and with the club, he won the UEFA Super Cup in 1993, and the UEFA Cup in 1995 with Parma, and he also reached the final of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1994, as well as the finals of the Italian Cup and the Italian Super Cup in 1995. It was with the blue and yellow club that he cemented his reputation as one of the best and most talented creative players in Italy, along with Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero.

During the 1995–96 season, Zola initially experienced competition in the team with Bulgarian forward Hristo Stoichkov, who played the same tactical role as Zola; as a result, Zola would begin to be deployed in the starting eleven with less frequency, losing his place in the squad, despite scoring 10 league goals. During the following season, manager Carlo Ancelotti came to see Zola as a &quot;square peg&quot; unable to fit into his rigid 4–4–2 system upon his arrival at the club in 1996. Zola was played out of position in a left midfield role, scoring only 2 goals, as Ancelotti preferred to play Hernán Crespo and Enrico Chiesa up-front. Zola became frustrated of playing in this role and ultimately made himself available for a transfer, moving to Premier League side Chelsea in November 1996. In total, Zola made 102 league appearances with Parma, scoring 49 goals.

===Chelsea===

In November 1996, Zola joined Chelsea for £4.5 million as one of several continental players signed by Ruud Gullit (including compatriot Gianluca Vialli) and was assigned the number 25 jersey. He made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. In his debut season he demonstrated his skill and talent, and put in several notable performances, scoring a series of memorable goals. In February 1997, after spiriting the ball around Manchester United&#x27;s defence in the penalty area before slotting the ball past goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, he was described by United manager Alex Ferguson as a &quot;clever little so-and-so&quot;.

He was a key player in Chelsea&#x27;s resurgence in the 1996–97 season, helping them win the FA Cup with a 2–0 win over Middlesbrough at Wembley Stadium having scored four goals en route to the final, including a 25-yard curling shot against Liverpool as Chelsea came from 0–2 behind to win 4–2, and a memorable goal of individual skill in the semi-final against Wimbledon, backheeling the ball and turning 180 degrees before slotting the ball into the net. At the end of the season he was voted FWA Player of the Year, the only player ever to win the accolade without playing a full season in the English league and the first Chelsea player to win it.

In the 1997–98 season, Zola helped Chelsea win three more trophies, the League Cup, the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the Super Cup. An injury denied him a place in the starting line-up for the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final against Stuttgart at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm, but he still played an important part in Chelsea&#x27;s victory, as he came on as a second-half substitute and scored the winning goal after barely 30 seconds. With only his second touch of the game, he struck a through ball from Dennis Wise into the roof of the net to secure Chelsea&#x27;s third major trophy in a year and the second European trophy in the club&#x27;s history. In the same season, Zola hit his first professional hat-trick, in a 4–0 victory over Derby County at Stamford Bridge in November 1997.
When Chelsea made their first appearance in the Champions League in 1999–2000, Zola was a key player throughout the campaign, although he found his chances in the Premier League more limited, owing to manager Gianluca Vialli&#x27;s squad rotation policy. Zola scored three goals in Chelsea&#x27;s run to the Champions League quarter-finals, including a curling free kick against Barcelona, and he again won the FA Cup with the club, with his free-kick in the final against Aston Villa setting up Roberto Di Matteo&#x27;s winner. His later years with Chelsea saw his appearances restricted by the new strike pairing of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eiður Guðjohnsen. During the 2000–01 Premier League season, Zola managed 9 league goals.
In the 2001–02 season, Zola&#x27;s starting chances became limited, after a summer when Claudio Ranieri showed the door to many of Chelsea&#x27;s ageing stars such as club captain Dennis Wise, goalscoring midfielder Gustavo Poyet and French defender Frank Leboeuf, scoring only 3 goals. Zola was limited to infrequent starts and many substitute appearances due to Ranieri&#x27;s new policy of decreasing the average age of the Chelsea squad, preferring to play the Icelandic youngster Gudjohnsen with Hasselbaink. Zola did draw attention, however, for his dominant performance when he scored with a notable backheeled effort in mid-air from a corner-kick, in an FA Cup tie against Norwich City on 16 January 2002. Manager Claudio Ranieri described the goal as &quot;fantasy, magic&quot;.

In 2002–03, his final season with Chelsea, he enjoyed a renaissance, scoring 16 goals, his highest seasonal tally for Chelsea, and was voted the club&#x27;s player of the year after helping Chelsea qualify for the Champions League. Zola scored his final goal for Chelsea, a lob from outside the penalty area against Everton, on Easter Monday 2003. He made his final competitive appearance for the club on the final day of the season with a 20-minute cameo against Liverpool, beating four Liverpool players with a dribble late on in the match, gaining applause from both sets of fans in one of the final moments of his career. He played in a total of 312 games for Chelsea and scored 80 goals, scoring 59 goals in 229 Premier League appearances. He subsequently decided to return to Italy during the following season.

Zola was voted as the best ever Chelsea player by Chelsea&#x27;s fans in early 2003. In November 2004, he was awarded an OBE, Honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire in a special ceremony in Rome. In 2005, Zola was voted into the Chelsea F.C. Centenary Eleven, occupying one of the two forward roles. No Chelsea player held Zola&#x27;s number 25 shirt since his departure in 2003 until the number was given to Moisés Caicedo 20 years later in 2023 after he contacted Zola for permission to wear the shirt. Zola was also voted by &quot;The Sun&quot; one of the top ten best foreign &quot;artistic&quot; players in Premier League history in 2007, coming in second place behind George Best.

===Cagliari===
In the summer of 2003, amid rumours of an impending takeover at Chelsea, Zola left Stamford Bridge to join Cagliari, from his native Sardinia. Within a week Chelsea was acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

It was reported that Abramovich tried to buy the entire Cagliari club when Zola refused to renege on his verbal contract with Cagliari, although Zola himself will not confirm it. Zola subsequently led Cagliari to promotion to the Italian Serie A, then renewed his contract for one more year. He retired in June 2005, after ending his career in appropriate style with a double against Juventus in his last professional game. His number 10 Cagliari jersey was withdrawn in his honour for the season after he left but was worn in the 2006–07 season by Andrea Capone. Zola retired as the fifth highest goalscorer of free-kicks in Serie A history, with 20 goals from set-pieces, and currently sits behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio (both at 21), Alessandro Del Piero (22), Andrea Pirlo (26) and Siniša Mihajlović (28). With 12 goals from free kicks, he is also the joint–third all-time goalscorer from set-pieces in the history of the Premier League, alongside Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo, and behind only James Ward-Prowse (17) and David Beckham.

==International career==
Zola made his debut for Italy aged 25 on 13 November 1991 in Genoa, under manager Arrigo Sacchi, in a Euro 1992 qualifier against Norway which ended 1–1. He appeared at the 1994 World Cup in the United States, making one substitute appearance on his 28th birthday in the second round knock-out match against Nigeria in Boston, with Italy trailing 1–0. After only twelve minutes on the field, Zola was controversially sent off, after being judged by the referee to have fouled Augustine Eguavoen. Although Italy managed to win the match 2–1 in extra-time and reach the World Cup final, Zola did not regain his place in the side after this suspension.
His first two goals came on 25 March 1995, in a 4–1 win against Estonia in Salerno in a Euro 1996 qualifier.

Zola was called up for Euro 1996, and he played in all three group games at the tournament. He set up Pierluigi Casiraghi&#x27;s second goal in the team&#x27;s 2–1 win in the opening group match against Russia, but in the team&#x27;s final group match, he notably missed a potential match-winning penalty in a 0–0 draw against eventual champions Germany as Italy surprisingly crashed out in the first round. He scored the only goal of the game in an historic 1–0 victory over England in a 1998 World Cup qualifying match at Wembley, on 12 February 1997. He won his final cap for Italy in the return fixture against England in Rome on 11 October 1997, which ended in a draw. He retired from international play after he was not called up for the 1998 World Cup by manager Cesare Maldini, who had selected Del Piero and Roberto Baggio in his role. Zola finished his international career with a total of 35 caps and ten goals.

As a Sardinian he could also be eligible for the Sardinian national football team, who represented the island on several occasions in Non-FIFA football. Indeed, he played in the first ever official documented appearance of the formation in 1990. The England national football team was in Sardinia for a training camp in order to prepare the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, where, among other things, it would have played two of the three matches of the group stage in Cagliari. Therefore, it had been set up a XI formed by the best Sardinian players caught between Serie C and Amateurs to face the Lions in their first friendly match. Zola, at that time a player for S.S.C. Napoli, was the only professional player and the most representative one of the squad. The &quot;Three Lions&quot; won with a 10–1 score. 7 years later he was called for the second match against Corsica. For this match, all professional players were called (Zola was in Parma A.C.) and the Sardinians won 1–0 with a winning goal by Zola.

==Other work after retirement==
In his playing career, Zola played 628 games and scored 193 goals in league play. Despite speculation he would play on in the 2005–06 season, Zola decided to leave the game just a week before he turned 39, and took a job as an Italian football pundit. Rumours were circulating within Australia that Zola was being chased by several A-League clubs, including Sydney, Melbourne Victory and Perth Glory, about a possible comeback, but Zola quashed such rumours. He did, however, play a charity match in Sydney in December 2006, appearing in both Marconi Stallions and APIA colours. Zola also played against Shrewsbury Town in the first match at their New Meadow stadium for &quot;A-line Allstars&quot; on 14 July 2007 as part of a kit sponsorship deal between the club and boot manufacturer A-line, who made Zola&#x27;s boots.

==Managerial career==
===Italy U21===
In 2006, Zola started his coaching career, being appointed as assistant manager to Italy U21 manager and Pierluigi Casiraghi by the Italian Football Federation. The duo led the &quot;azzurrini&quot; to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, where they reached the quarter-finals before being defeated 3–2 by Belgium under-21s.

===West Ham United===

On 7 September 2008, it was reported that Zola had been interviewed in Rome for the vacant manager&#x27;s position at West Ham United and had &quot;impressed the Club&#x27;s representatives&quot; at the interview. Two days later, he agreed a three-year contract to manage West Ham United, replacing Alan Curbishley, who resigned following differences with the board.
He was unveiled as manager on 11 September, despite not having the required UEFA A managing licence. Zola, surprisingly for someone closely associated with West Ham&#x27;s cross-town rivals Chelsea, quickly gained the backing of the fans. Nevertheless, he received applause from Chelsea fans whenever he returned to Stamford Bridge as West Ham manager. After a shaky start Zola began to develop a side with a flair not seen in a West Ham side for some years.

Zola also received praise for integrating more youth products into the first team. The likes of Junior Stanislas and Zavon Hines were given their debuts. The duo and first team youngsters Jack Collison and James Tomkins all scored their first goals for the club during his tenure. In April 2009, Zola signed a contract that could have kept him at Upton Park until 2013.

West Ham struggled in the 2009–10 season. Zola&#x27;s position as manager was put in doubt when he revealed he had not been consulted over a bid for West Bromwich Albion player Graham Dorrans and by chairman David Sullivan&#x27;s announcement that the entire squad was for sale except for midfielder Scott Parker. West Ham finished in 17th place, only five points above the relegation places. On 11 May 2010, two days after the end of the 2009–10 season, West Ham announced the termination of Zola&#x27;s contract with immediate effect. Avram Grant was announced as his successor on 3 June 2010, and a week later it was announced that the club had reached a compensation settlement with Zola.

===Watford===
Zola was strongly linked with the managerial position at Watford in 2012, following the club&#x27;s takeover by Udinese and Granada owner Giampaolo Pozzo. He was confirmed as Watford manager on 7 July, signing a two-year contract.

In his first season, Zola led Watford to 3rd place and a play-off position, which then saw them progress to the final at Wembley. There, they lost 1–0 to 5th place side Crystal Palace after extra-time. On 16 December 2013, Zola resigned as Watford manager. At the time of his resignation, Watford were 13th in the league, had not won since October 2013 and had lost their last five home games.

===Cagliari===

On 24 December 2014, Zola was appointed as the new manager of Cagliari following Zdeněk Zeman&#x27;s dismissal. In his first match in charge, on 6 January 2015, Cagliari lost 0–5 at Palermo with Daniele Conti being sent off in the first half, the result keeping the club in the relegation zone. Two days later he completed his first transfer as manager of the club, taking centre-back Alejandro González on loan from fellow Serie A club Hellas Verona. Zola won his first game on 11 January 2015, a 2–1 win over Cesena. After less than three months as Cagliari&#x27;s manager, Zola was sacked on 9 March 2015, after being unable to escape the relegation zone after 10 matches; following his dismissal, Zeman was reinstated as Cagliari&#x27;s manager.

===Al-Arabi===
On 11 July 2015, Zola was appointed coach of Qatar team Al-Arabi. After a poor first season in the Qatar Stars League, he was sacked, having achieved 10 wins from 26 games, losing 11, with the team placing 8th out of 14.

===Birmingham City===
On 14 December 2016, Zola was named manager of EFL Championship club Birmingham City, replacing Gary Rowett who had been sacked earlier that day. At the time, Birmingham sat 7th in the table, outside the playoff positions only on goal difference. Three days later, the team conceded a late goal to lose his first game in charge 2–1 at home to second-placed Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. They did not win until Zola&#x27;s 11th match in charge, a 1–0 win over Fulham on 4 February 2017. On 17 April, Zola resigned as manager following a 2–0 home defeat to Burton Albion which left the team just three points above the relegation zone with three matches remaining. They had won just twice during his 24-match tenure.

===Chelsea===
On 18 July 2018, Zola was appointed as assistant first-team coach to Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea. On 4 July 2019, after the arrival of Frank Lampard as head coach, Zola departed the club.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===

During his playing career, Zola was primarily used as a supporting striker or as a playmaking attacking midfielder, due to his ability to create chances and provide assists for teammates; he was also deployed as a winger (although this was not his favoured position, as he did not excel in this role) or even as a striker on occasion.

A creative, technically gifted and selfless right-footed team player, Zola was renowned for his ball control, his skilful dribbling ability, vision, and passing ability with either foot, as well as his tactical intelligence, ability to read the game and eye for goal. Although he was not physically imposing, his small stature and low centre of gravity gave him good balance and allowed him to be extremely quick and agile, which, along with his acceleration, speed, and ball skills, enabled him to change direction with the ball very quickly in tight spaces, and allowed him to beat defenders with feints in one on one situations.

Zola was also a penalty kick and set piece specialist, who was particularly renowned for his accuracy at bending direct free-kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Zola also stood out for his tenacity and work rate throughout his career, as well as his professionalism and fair–play. However, he was also known to be inconsistent on occasion, although he drew praise from managers and teammates for his ability to be decisive even when he was not at his best, and from pundits for his performances in big games. Due to his creativity, stature, and skill, Zola was given the nickname &quot;Magic box&quot; while playing at Chelsea.

===Reception===
Zola is regarded by pundits as one of the best Italian creative forwards of all time, and is credited for paving the way for Italian players to play outside of the peninsula; in 2022, he was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame. He is also considered one of the best players in both Chelsea&#x27;s and the Premier League&#x27;s history; in 2003, he was voted Chelsea&#x27;s greatest player ever, while in 2006 he was inducted into the National Football Museum&#x27;s English Football Hall of Fame. In 2017, Craig Burley of &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine placed Zola at number 7 in his list of the &quot;100 best foreign Premier League players ever.&quot; In 2013, Alex Richards of &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; placed Zola at number 12 in his list of the greatest dead ball specialists of all time. For his sportsmanship and playing ability, Zola was awarded the Premio Nazionale Carriera Esemplare &quot;Gaetano Scirea&quot; and the Pallone d&#x27;Argento in 2005 as well as the Premio internazionale Giacinto Facchetti in 2010.

==Personal life==
Zola is married to Franca and has three children; his son Andrea played for Grays Athletic and has played for West Ham United reserves. Former footballer turned criminal Fabrizio Maiello claimed to have targeted Zola as a kidnap target in 1994.

==Media==
Zola features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;.

Zola was the subject of a long-running urban legend where it was believed by some people that he appeared in the video for Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s 1983 song &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;. In a 2012 interview, Zola confirmed that he did not appear in the video.

He has, however, appeared in a music video for the song &quot;Zola&quot; by Derry band Wonder Villains.

Zola once appeared in an episode of &quot;Renford Rejects&quot;, where he played a match for the Rejects against the Renford Razors and Martin Keown.

<text>The Gauss gun (often called a Gauss rifle or Gauss cannon) is a device that uses permanent magnets and the physics of the Newton&#x27;s cradle to accelerate a projectile. Gauss guns are distinct from and predate coil guns, although many works of science fiction (and occasionally educators) have confused the two. Typical use of the Gauss rifle is to demonstrate the effects of energy and momentum transfer, however, self-assembling microbots based on the principle have been proposed for tissue penetration.

==Mechanism==

In its frequent incarnation as a physics demonstration, a Gauss gun usually consists of series of ferromagnetic balls on a nonmagnetic track. On the track is a permanent magnet with a ball, the projectile, stuck to the front of it. Between the projectile and the magnet is a spacer, usually consisting of one or more additional balls. Yet another ball, the trigger ball, is released from behind the magnet. It is attracted to and accelerates toward the magnet. When it strikes the back of the magnet, it transfers its momentum to the projectile ball, which is knocked off the front of the stack, as in a Newton&#x27;s cradle. Because the spacer kept it far away from the magnet, the projectile loses less energy escaping from the magnet&#x27;s influence than the trigger ball gave it, so it leaves the stack with a higher velocity than the trigger ball entered with.

Once the ball is launched, the trigger ball must be pried off the back of the magnet before it can be used again. This is where the energy to shoot the gun ultimately comes from.

Multi-stage Gauss guns are also possible, with the projectile of each stage becoming the trigger for the next, carrying its energy forward so that each stage contributes energy to the final projectile.

<text>Cnemidophorus is a genus of lizards in the family Teiidae. Species in the genus &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot; are commonly referred to as whiptail lizards or racerunners. The genus is native to South America, Central America, and the West Indies.

==Taxonomy==
 (2002) re-examined the nomenclature for the genus &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot; (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) and split it into the two genera &quot;Aspidoscelis&quot; and &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot; (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;). A further split by et al. (2012) added the genera &quot;Ameivula&quot; and &quot;Contomastix&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot; literally means &quot;greave-wearing&quot;, from the Ancient Greek &#x27; (combining form of &#x27;, &quot;greave&quot;, a leg armor) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;bearer&quot;).

==Reproduction==
In some of the &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot; species, there are no males, and they reproduce through parthenogenesis. This is well known in bees and aphids, but is very rare in vertebrates. Those species without males are now known to originate through hybridization, or interspecific breeding. Occasionally, a mating between a female of one species and a male of another produces a parthenogen, a female that is able to produce viable eggs that are genetically identical to her own cells. The lizards that hatch from these eggs are thus also parthenogens that can again produce identical eggs, resulting in an asexual, clonal population. Parthenogenetic species resulting from a single hybridization are diploid (that is, they have two sets of chromosomes just as sexual species do), but sometimes these females mate with other males, producing offspring which are triploid (that is, they have three sets of chromosomes, or 50% more than equivalent sexual species; see polyploidy). Over 30% of the genus &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot; are parthenogenic.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot; (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) contains the following species which are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Cnemidophorus arenivagus&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus arubensis&quot; – Aruba whiptail
*&quot;Cnemidophorus cryptus&quot; – cryptic racerunner
*&quot;Cnemidophorus duellmani&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus espeuti&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus flavissimus&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus gaigei&quot; – Gaige&#x27;s rainbow lizard
*&quot;Cnemidophorus gramivagus&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus lemniscatus&quot; – rainbow whiptail
*&quot;Cnemidophorus leucopsammus&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus murinus&quot; – Laurent&#x27;s whiptail
*&quot;Cnemidophorus nigricolor&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus pseudolemniscatus&quot; – Cole&#x27;s racerunner
*&quot;Cnemidophorus rostralis&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus ruatanus&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus ruthveni&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus senectus&quot; 
*&quot;Cnemidophorus splendidus&quot; – blue rainbow lizard
*&quot;Cnemidophorus vanzoi&quot; – Saint Lucia whiptail, Vanzo&#x27;s whiptail
&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot;.

<text>Crocodilurus is a monotypic lizard genus consisting of one species, Crocodilurus amazonicus, belonging to the family Teiidae (tegus, ameivas and whiptails). Its common name is the crocodile tegu, due to its appearance and fondness for water, and is locally known as the jacarerana. This semi-aquatic, predatory lizard has a flattened, paddle-like tail, enabling it to swim with ease. Also it has a red coloration on its tail

==Figurative name==
The crocodile tegu has no close relation to crocodilians. The name &quot;Crocodilurus amazonicus&quot; (&quot;Amazonian little crocodile&quot;) is only an analogy: It is a predatory reptile well adapted to living and hunting in water.

==Distribution==
&quot;C. amazonicus&quot; is found in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield in South America.

==Diet==
&quot;C. amazonicus&quot; preys upon arthropods, fish, amphibians, and reptiles.

<text>Dracaena (romanized form of the Ancient Greek δράκαινα - &quot;drakaina&quot;, &quot;female dragon&quot;), is a genus of lizards, also commonly called caiman lizards or water tegus, in the family Teiidae, along with tegus and ameivas. Caiman lizards are native to South America, where they are found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru. These semiaquatic lizards spend a lot of time in the water and inhabit marshes, streams, and flooded forests. Caiman lizards often bask on branches overhanging the water.

== Classification ==
===Extant Species===
Listed alphabetically.
===Fossils===

* †&quot;Paradracaena colombiana&quot; - the Middle Miocene (Laventan) Honda Group, Colombia

== Description ==

The caiman lizards are built similarly to their cousins the tegus, with a large, heavyset body and short but powerful limbs. Their heads are bulky and often a red or orange color. Their jaws are heavily muscular to help aid in eating its normal prey of snails, crawfish and fresh water clams. They also have a few adaptations that help them in their watery habitat. They have long, laterally flattened tails, similar to their namesake, the yacare caiman. The long tails help the caiman lizards to successfully swim and dive. They also have clear third eyelids which are thought to act like a pair of goggles underwater.

The coloration of the northern caiman lizard (&quot;Dracaena guianensis&quot;) is very similar to that of a crocodile. It is typically bright green with slight dark green banding. The Paraguayan caiman lizard (&quot;Dracaena paraguayensis&quot;) is typically much more drab, with a gray body and head. There are tough raised scutes along the dorsal portion of the back. These give the caiman lizards a crocodilian appearance and help to provide some protection against predators. These lizards can become up to long and weigh up to .

== Captivity ==

Caiman lizards are kept in private collections, but they are not yet kept in large numbers due to their tendency to only accept snails and their high price. Additionally, caiman lizards are arboreal, aquatic and burrowing, so suitable enclosures are usually only made by zoos. Caiman lizards born in captivity have been known to take a variety of food items, including snails, fish, cat food and crustaceans. Their temperament is comparable to that of a tegu.

<doc id="346922" wikidata="Q2106822" url="?curid=346922" title="Tupinambis">
<text>Tupinambis is a lizard genus which belongs to the family Teiidae and contains eight described species. These large lizards are commonly referred to as [[tegu]]s (teiús in Portuguese). &quot;T. merianae&quot; (Argentine black and white tegu), &quot;T. rufescens&quot; (red tegu), and &quot;T. teguixin&quot; (gold tegu) are popular in the pet trade. They are primarily found in South America, although &quot;T. teguixin&quot; also occurs in Panama.

In 2012, a number of tegu species were reclassified from &quot;Tupinambis&quot; to the previously used genus &quot;Salvator&quot;. The newly proposed classification comes from a restructuring of the family Teiidae based upon the study of 137 morphological characteristics. The new classification is as follows: &quot;Salvator duseni&quot; (yellow tegu), &quot;Salvator rufescens&quot; (red tegu), &quot;Salvator merianae&quot; (Argentine black and white tegu), &quot;Tupinambis teguixin&quot; (gold tegu), &quot;Tupinambis longilineus&quot; (Rhondonia tegu), &quot;Tupinambis palustris&quot; (swamp tegu) and &quot;Tupinambis quadrilineatus&quot; (four-lined tegu).

==Names==
&quot;Tupinambis&quot; lizards are called teiú in Portuguese. The lizards are also called tishiriú in the extinct Tuxá language of 
Bahia, Brazil, and dzižuảsu in the extinct Potiguara language of Pernambuco, Brazil.

As with many other animals from tropical South America (e.g. the Cariamae), &quot;Tupinambis&quot; owes its scientific name to the pioneering accounts given by Piso &amp; Marcgrave in their &quot;Historia Naturalis Brasiliae&quot; (1648). However, a misinterpretation (by Linnaeus) of the Latin text occurred, which reads &quot;TEIVGVACV [...] Tupinambis&quot;, &#x27;to the Tupinambá [Indigenous group] TEIVGVACU&#x27;. &quot;Tupinambis&quot; was merely a metalinguistic term meaning &#x27;to/for the Tupinambá,&#x27; whereas the intended, indigenous name for the animal was &quot;teiú-guaçú&quot; [lizard-big]; lit. &#x27;big lizard&#x27;.

==Description==
The &quot;Tupinambis&quot; species have heterodont dentition consisting of four different types of teeth. Incisor-type—tricuspid—teeth reside at the tip of the mouth. Recurved canine-type teeth occur further back on the tooth row. Behind those reside a separate set of incisor-like teeth (though flattened in a perpendicular plane to the first set of incisors). The rearmost teeth are blunt, rounded, peg-shaped teeth. The rearmost two tooth classes only occur in sexually mature individuals, thus indicating an ontogenetic shift in tooth morphology. Along with changes in tooth type, the frequency of each tooth type also changes with ontogeny, without an overall change in tooth count (approximately 70 teeth). Rather than increase tooth count, the teeth themselves increase in size as the jaw grows from hatchling to adult. This ontogenetic shift in tooth morphology suggests a shift in diet with age; however, few dietary studies have been done to support this claim and limited stomach content observations do not show much variability between hatchlings and juveniles. &quot;T. teguxin&quot; is an omnivore, consuming both fruit and as well as invertebrate and vertebrate prey.

==Taxonomy==
Species listed alphabetically by specific name.
==Evolution==
Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates a deep divergence between a northern clade (containing &quot;T. teguixin&quot;, &quot;T. palustris&quot; and &quot;T. quadrilineatus&quot;) and a southern clade (containing &quot;T. duseni&quot;). The northern and southern clades are morphologically distinct, with the northern clade possessing a single pair of loreal scales between the eye and the nostril and a smooth texture to the scales on the body and the southern clade possessing two pairs of loreal scales and a bumpy texture to the scales on the body. At least one review of the morphology of the family Teiidae has placed the tegus of the southern clade in the genus &quot;Salvator.&quot; Subsequent studies support the paraphyletic status of &quot;Tupinambis&quot;, though further research will be necessary to determine if the split will gain wider acceptance among the herpetological community. Comparative analysis of hemipenial anatomy also provides support for the split between &quot;Tupinambis&quot; and &quot;Salvator&quot;.

Tegus probably originated sometime during the Cenozoic era. &quot;Tupinambis&quot; fossils from Argentina date back to the Late Miocene. Fossils of the extinct tegu &quot;Paradracaena&quot; can be found in earlier Miocene deposits.

<text>Cheri Huber (born c. 1944) is an American meditation teacher in the Sōtō School of Zen Buddhism tradition.

==Biography==
Huber is the founder and guiding teacher of Zen Monastery Peace Center located in Murphys, California, which was constructed in 1993. The plot of land was purchased in 1987, with . She was raised in the San Francisco Bay area and claims to have studied Zen under Jay DuPont. Writer Anna Kaplan says that Huber had once desired to live in a cabin in the woods in isolation of the world, but was encouraged by another teacher to teach Zen. The name of this teacher is not named. She founded her first Zen center in 1983 in Mountain View, California, which has since moved to Palo Alto under the name Palo Alto Zen Center. In 1997, Huber founded Living Compassion, a nonprofit organization dedicated to peace and service.

There have been some questions raised about her authority to teach Zen from some members of the Zen community. Author and ordained Buddhist priest James Ishmael Ford writes of her, &quot;Perhaps the most prominent of apparently self-declared teachers is the widely read author and meditation teacher Cheri Huber. Huber may have studied briefly with Jay DuPont...but it is not clear that she was authorized to teach by him or anyone else as a Zen teacher.&quot;

<doc id="346939" wikidata="Q68763" url="?curid=346939" title="Carob">
<text>The carob ( ; Ceratonia siliqua) is a flowering evergreen tree or shrub in the Caesalpinioideae sub-family of the legume family, Fabaceae. It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, which takes the form of seed pods, and as an ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. The carob tree is native to the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. Portugal is the largest producer of carob, followed by Italy and Morocco.

In the Mediterranean Basin, extended to the southern Atlantic coast of Portugal (i.e., the Algarve region) and the Atlantic northwestern Moroccan coast, carob pods were often used as animal feed and in times of famine, as &quot;the last source of [human] food in hard times&quot;. The ripe, dried, and sometimes toasted pod is often ground into carob powder, which was sometimes used as a substitute for cocoa powder, especially in the 1970s natural food movement. The powder and chips can be used as a chocolate alternative in most recipes.

The plant&#x27;s seeds are used to produce locust bean gum or carob gum, a common thickening agent used in food processing.

==Description==

The carob tree grows up to tall. The crown is broad and semispherical, supported by a thick trunk with rough brown bark and sturdy branches. Its leaves are long, alternate, pinnate, and may or may not have a terminal leaflet. It is frost-tolerant to roughly .

Most carob trees are dioecious and some are hermaphroditic, so strictly male trees do not produce fruit. When the trees blossom in autumn, the flowers are small and numerous, spirally arranged along the inflorescence axis in catkin-like racemes borne on spurs from old wood and even on the trunk (cauliflory); they are pollinated by both wind and insects. The male flowers smell like human semen, an odor that is caused in part by amines.

The fruit is a legume (also known commonly, but less accurately, as a &quot;pod&quot;), that is elongated, compressed, straight, or curved, and thickened at the sutures. The pods take a full year to develop and ripen. When the sweet, ripe pods eventually fall to the ground, they are eaten by various mammals, such as swine, thereby dispersing the hard inner seed in the excrement.

The seeds of the carob tree contain leucodelphinidin, a colourless flavanol precursor related to leucoanthocyanidins.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;carob&quot; comes from Middle French &#x27; (modern French ), which borrowed it from Arabic (&quot;kharrūb&quot;, &quot;locust bean pod&quot;) and Persian &quot;khirnub&quot;, which ultimately borrowed it perhaps from Akkadian language &#x27; or Aramaic &quot;ḥarrūḇā&quot;. &#x27;

&quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot;, the scientific name of the carob tree, derives from the Greek &quot;keratōnia&quot;, &quot;carob-tree&quot; (cf. &quot;kéras&quot;, &quot;horn&quot;), and Latin &quot;siliqua&quot; &quot;pod, carob&quot;.

In English, it is also known as &quot;St. John&#x27;s bread&quot; and &quot;locust tree&quot; (not to be confused with African locust bean). The latter designation also applies to several other trees from the same family.

In Yiddish, it is called &quot;bokser&quot;, derived from the Middle High German &quot;bokshornboum&quot; &quot;ram&#x27;s horn tree&quot; (in reference to the shape of the carob).

The &quot;carat&quot;, a unit of mass for gemstones, and a measurement of purity for gold, takes its name via the Arabic &quot;qīrāṭ&quot; from the Greek name for the carob seed (lit. &quot;small horn&quot;).

== Distribution and habitat ==
Although cultivated extensively, carob can still be found growing wild in eastern Mediterranean regions, and has become naturalized in the western Mediterranean.

The tree is typical in the southern Portuguese region of the Algarve, where the tree is called &quot;alfarrobeira&quot;, and the fruit &quot;alfarroba.&quot; It is also seen in southern and eastern Spain (, Catalan / Valencian / Balearic: &quot;garrofer, garrofera, garrover, garrovera&quot;), mainly in the regions of Andalusia, Murcia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands and Catalonia (Catalan / Valencian / Balearic: &quot;garrofer, garrofera, garrover, garrovera&quot;); Malta (), on the Italian islands of Sicily () and Sardinia (), in Southern Croatia (), such as on the island of Šipan, in eastern Bulgaria (), and in Southern Greece, Cyprus, as well as on many Greek islands such as Crete and Samos.

In Israel, the Hebrew name is חרוב ( &quot;charuv&quot;). The common Greek name is ( ), or ( , meaning &quot;wooden horn&quot;). In Turkey, it is known as &quot;goat&#x27;s horn&quot; ().

The various trees known as &quot;algarrobo&quot; in Latin America (&quot;Samanea saman&quot; in Cuba, &quot;Prosopis pallida&quot; in Peru, and four species of &quot;Prosopis&quot; in Argentina and Paraguay) belong to a different subfamily of the Fabaceae: Mimosoideae. Early Spanish settlers named them &quot;algarrobo&quot; after the carob tree because they also produce pods with sweet pulp.

== Ecology ==
The carob genus, &quot;Ceratonia&quot;, belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is believed to be an archaic remnant of a part of this family now generally considered extinct. It grows well in warm temperate and subtropical areas, and tolerates hot and humid coastal areas. As a xerophyte (drought-resistant species), carob is well adapted to the conditions of the Mediterranean region with just of rainfall per year.

Carob trees can survive long periods of drought, but to grow fruit, they need of rainfall per year. They prefer well-drained, sandy loams and are intolerant of waterlogging, but the deep root systems can adapt to a wide variety of soil conditions and are fairly salt-tolerant (up to 3% in soil). After being irrigated with saline water in the summer, carob trees could possibly recover during winter rainfalls. In some experiments, young carob trees were capable of basic physiological functions under high-salt conditions (40 mmol NaCl/L).

Not all legume species can develop a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia to make use of atmospheric nitrogen. It remains unclear if carob trees have this ability: Some findings suggest that it is not able to form root nodules with rhizobia, while in another more recent study, trees have been identified with nodules containing bacteria believed to be from the genus &quot;Rhizobium&quot;. However, a study measuring the 15N-signal (isotopic signature) in the tissue of the carob tree did not support the theory that carob trees naturally use atmospheric nitrogen.

== Cultivation ==
The vegetative propagation of carob is naturally restricted due to its low adventitious rooting potential. Therefore, grafting and air-layering may prove to be more effective methods of asexual propagation. Seeds are commonly used as the propagation medium. The sowing occurs in pot nurseries in early spring and the cooling- and drying-sensitive seedlings are then transplanted to the field in the next year after the last frost. Carob trees enter slowly into production phase. Where in areas with favorable growing conditions, the cropping starts 3–4 years after budding, with the nonbearing period requiring up to 8 years in regions with marginal soils. Full bearing of the trees occurs mostly at a tree-age of 20–25 years when the yield stabilizes. The orchards are traditionally planted in low densities of 25–45 trees per hectare (). Hermaphroditic or male trees, which produce fewer or no pods, respectively, are usually planted in lower densities in the orchards as pollenizers.

Intercropping with other tree species is widely spread. Not much cultivation management is required. Only light pruning and occasional tilling to reduce weeds is necessary. Nitrogen-fertilizing of the plants has been shown to have positive impacts on yield performance. Although it is native to moderately dry climates, two or three summers&#x27; irrigation greatly aid the development, hasten the fruiting, and increase the yield of a carob tree.

===Harvest and post-harvest treatment===
The most labour-intensive part of carob cultivation is harvesting, which is often done by knocking the fruit down with a long stick and gathering them together with the help of laid-out nets. This is a delicate task because the trees are flowering at the same time and care has to be taken not to damage the flowers and the next year&#x27;s crop. The literature recommends research to get the fruit to ripen more uniformly or also for cultivars which can be mechanically harvested (by shaking).

After harvest, carob pods have a moisture content of 10–20% and should be dried down to a moisture content of 8% so the pods do not rot. Further processing separates the kernels (seeds) from the pulp. This process is called kibbling and results in seeds and pieces of carob pods (kibbles). Processing of the pulp includes grinding for animal feed production or roasting and milling for human food industry. The seeds have to be peeled which happens with acid or through roasting. Then the endosperm and the embryo are separated for different uses.

===Pests and diseases===
Few pests are known to cause severe damage in carob orchards, so they have traditionally not been treated with pesticides. Some generalist pests such as the larvae of the leopard moth (&quot;Zeuzera pyrina&quot; L.), the dried fruit moth (&quot;Cadra calidella&quot;), small rodents such as rats (&quot;Rattus spp.&quot;) and gophers (&quot;Pitymys spp.&quot;) can cause damage occasionally in some regions. Only some cultivars are severely susceptible to mildew disease (&quot;Oidium ceratoniae&quot; C.). One pest directly associated with carob is the larva of the carob moth (&quot;Myelois ceratoniae&quot; Z.), which can cause extensive postharvest damage.

&quot;Cadra calidella&quot; attack carob crops before harvest and infest products in stores. This moth, prevalent in Cyprus, will often infest the country&#x27;s carob stores. Research has been conducted to understand the physiology of the moth, in order to gain insight on how to monitor moth reproduction and lower their survival rates, such as through temperature control, pheromone traps, or parasitoid traps.

==Production==
In 2022, world production of carob (as locust beans) was estimated to be 56,423 tonnes, although not all countries known to grow carob reported their results to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Production amounts for Turkey and Morocco accounted for nearly all the world total reported in 2022.

===Cultivars and breeding aims===
Most of the roughly 50 known cultivars are of unknown origin and only regionally distributed. The cultivars show high genetic and therefore morphological and agronomical variation. No conventional breeding by controlled crossing has been reported, but selection from orchards or wild populations has been done. Domesticated carobs (&quot;C. s.&quot; var. &quot;edulis&quot;) can be distinguished from their wild relatives (&quot;C. s.&quot; var. &quot;silvestris&quot;) by some fruit-yielding traits such as building of greater beans, more pulp, and higher sugar contents. Also, genetic adaptation of some varieties to the climatic requirements of their growing regions has occurred. Though a partially successful breaking of the dioecy happened, the yield of hermaphrodite trees still cannot compete with that of female plants, as their pod-bearing properties are worse. Future breeding would be focused on processing-quality aspects, as well as on properties for better mechanization of harvest or better-yielding hermaphroditic plants. The use of modern breeding techniques is restricted due to low polymorphism for molecular markers.

==Uses==

===Food===

Carob products consumed by humans come from the dried, sometimes roasted, pod, which has two main parts: the pulp accounts for 90% and the seeds 10% by weight. Carob pulp is sold either as flour or &quot;chunks&quot;. The flour of the carob embryo (seed) can also be used for human and animal nutrition, but the seed is often separated before making &quot;carob powder&quot; (see section on &quot;locust bean gum&quot; below).

Carob pods are mildly sweet on their own (being roughly one third to one half sugar by dry weight), so they are used in powdered, chip or syrup form as an ingredient in cakes and cookies, sometimes as a substitute for chocolate in recipes because of the color, texture, and taste of carob. In Malta, a traditional sweet called &quot;karamelli tal-harrub&quot; and eaten during the Christian holidays of Lent and Good Friday is made from carob pods. Dried carob fruit is traditionally eaten on the Jewish holiday of &quot;Tu Bishvat&quot;.

==== Carob powder ====
Carob powder (carob pulp flour) is made of roasted, then finely ground, carob pod pulp.

==== Locust bean gum ====
Locust bean gum is produced from the endosperm, which accounts for 42–46% of the carob seed, and is rich in galactomannans (88% of endosperm dry mass). Galactomannans are hydrophilic and swell in water. If galactomannans are mixed with other gelling substances, such as carrageenan, they can be used to effectively thicken the liquid part of food. This is used extensively in canned food for animals in order to get the &quot;jellied&quot; texture.

==== Animal feed ====
While chocolate contains the chemical compound theobromine in levels that are toxic to some mammals, carob contains none, and it also has no caffeine, so it is sometimes used to make chocolate-like treats for dogs. Carob pod meal is also used as an energy-rich feed for livestock, particularly for ruminants, though its high tannin content may limit this use.

Historically, carob pods were mainly used for animal fodder in the Maltese islands, apart from times of famine or war, when they formed part of the diet of many Maltese people. On the Iberian Peninsula, carob pods were historically fed to donkeys.

==== Composition ====
The pulp of a carob pod is about 48–56% sugars and 18% cellulose and hemicellulose. Some differences in sugar (sucrose) content are seen between wild and cultivated carob trees: ~531 g/kg dry weight in cultivated varieties and ~437 g/kg in wild varieties. Fructose and glucose levels do not differ between cultivated and wild carob. The embryo (20-25% of seed weight) is rich in proteins (50%). The testa, or seed coat (30–33% of seed weight), contains cellulose, lignins, and tannins.

===Syrup and drinks===
Carob pods are about a third to a half sugar by weight, and this sugar can be extracted into a syrup. In Malta, a carob syrup (&quot;ġulepp tal-ħarrub&quot;) is made out of the pods. Carob syrup is also used in Crete, and Cyprus exports it.

In Egypt and Palestine, crushed pods are heated to caramelize their sugar, then water is added and boiled for some time. The result is a cold beverage, also called &quot;kharrub&quot;, which is sold by juice shops and street vendors, especially in summer. This drink is popular during Ramadan in Gaza, and in summer in Egypt. 

In Lebanon the molasses is called &quot;debs el kharrub&quot; (literally: molasses of the carob), but people generally shorten it to &quot;debs&quot;. The molasses has a sweet, chocolate-like flavor. It is commonly mixed with tahini (typically 75% kharrub molasses and 25% tahini). The resulting mixture is called &quot;debs bi tahini&quot; and is eaten raw or with bread. The molasses is also used in certain cakes. The region of Iqlim al-Kharrub, which translates to the &quot;region of the carob&quot;, produces a significant amount of carob.

In Cyprus, the dried and milled carob pods are left to soak in water, before being transferred into special containers out of which the carob juice gradually seeps out of and is collected. The juice is then boiled with constant stirring yielding a thick syrup known as &quot;haroupomelo&quot;. Although this syrup is frequently sold and eaten as is, &quot;haroupomelo&quot; is also used as a base for a local toffee-like sweet snack known as &quot;pasteli&quot;. Constant stirring of the carob syrup causes it to form into a black, amorphous mass which is then left to cool. The mass is then kneaded, stretched and pulled until the fair, golden color and toffee-like texture of &quot;pasteli&quot; is obtained.

Carob is used for compote, liqueur, and syrup in Turkey, Malta, Portugal, Spain, and Sicily. In Libya, carob syrup (called &quot;rub&quot;) is used as a complement to &quot;asida&quot; (made from wheat flour). The so-called &quot;carob syrup&quot; made in Peru is actually from the fruit of the &quot;Prosopis nigra&quot; tree. Because of its strong taste, carob syrup is sometimes flavored with orange or chocolate. In Yemen, carob tree is playing a role in controlling diabetes mellitus according to Yemeni folk medicine, and diabetics consume carob pods as a juice to lower their blood sugar levels.

===Ornamental===

The carob tree is widely cultivated in the horticultural nursery industry as an ornamental plant for Mediterranean climates and other temperate regions around the world, being especially popular in California and Hawaii. The plant develops a sculpted trunk and the form of an ornamental tree after being &quot;limbed up&quot; as it matures, otherwise it is used as a dense and large screening hedge. The plant is very drought tolerant as long as one does not care about the size of the fruit harvest, so can be used in xeriscape landscape design for gardens, parks, and public municipal and commercial landscapes.

===Timber===

In some areas of Greece, viz. Crete, carob wood is often used as a firewood. As it makes such excellent fuel, it is sometimes even preferred over oak or olive wood.

Because the much fluted stem usually shows heart rot, carob wood is rarely used for construction timber. However, it is sometimes sought for ornamental work--particularly for furniture design, as the natural shape of the trunk is well-suited to the task. Additionally, the extremely wavy grain of the wood gives carob wood exceptional resistance to splitting; thus, sections of Carob bole are suitable for chopping blocks for splitting wood.

<text>Domenico &quot;Domingo&quot; Ghirardelli (; February 21, 1817 – January 17, 1894) was an Italian-born chocolatier who was the founder of the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company in San Francisco, California.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Domenico Ghirardelli was born on February 21, 1817, in Rapallo, Italy, to Giuseppe and Maddalena ( Ferretto) Ghirardelli. His father was a spice merchant in Genoa. In his teens, he apprenticed at Romanengo, a noted chocolatier in Genoa.

At about the age of twenty, in 1838, he moved to Uruguay, then in 1838 to Lima, Peru, where he established a confectionery, and began using the Spanish equivalent of his Italian name, Domingo. In 1849 he moved to California on the recommendation of his former neighbor, James Lick, who had brought 600 pounds of chocolate with him to San Francisco in 1848. Caught up in the California Gold Rush, he opened his first store in a mining camp to sell sweets and treats to miners who were lacking the small pleasures of life. Ghirardelli spent a few months in the gold fields near Sonora and Jamestown, before becoming a merchant in Hornitos, California.

===Career===

In 1852, he moved to San Francisco and established the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company at what would come to be known as Ghirardelli Square. According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; he is San Francisco&#x27;s most successful chocolatier.

Around the year 1865, a worker at the Ghirardelli factory discovered that by hanging a bag of ground cacao beans in a warm room, the cocoa butter would drip off, leaving behind a residue that could then be converted into ground chocolate. This technique, known as the Broma process is now the most common method used for the production of chocolate.

===Personal life===
Ghirardelli married Elisabetta Corsini (nicknamed &quot;Bettina&quot;), a native of Italy, in 1837. She died in 1846.

Ghirardelli married Carmen Alvarado Martin (1830–1887) in Lima, Peru, in 1847. Her first husband had been a French physician who had been lost at sea, and she had an eight-month-old child, Carmen. He and Carmen had seven children: Virginia (1847–1867); Domenico Jr. (1849–1932); Joseph Nicholas (1852–1906); Elvira (1856–1908); Louis (1857–1902); Angela (1859–1936); and Eugene Gustave (1860–?).

===Death===

He died on January 17, 1894, in Rapallo, Italy from influenza. His body was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California along with the rest of his family.

<doc id="346946" wikidata="Q1485461" url="?curid=346946" title="Pacific Southwest Airlines">
<text>Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) was a low-cost US airline headquartered in San Diego, California, that operated from 1949 to 1988. It was the first substantial scheduled discount airline. PSA called itself &quot;The World&#x27;s Friendliest Airline&quot; and painted a smile on the nose of its airplanes, the &quot;PSA Grinningbirds&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called PSA &quot;practically the unofficial flag carrier airline of California for almost forty years.&quot;

For three quarters of its existence, PSA operated as a California intrastate airline. PSA&#x27;s early success as an intrastate airline served as a model for Southwest Airlines, which did in Texas what PSA had done in California. After the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, PSA expanded to cities in other US western states and Mexico. However, PSA&#x27;s performance in the new deregulated era was disappointing relative to that of Southwest and PSA&#x27;s former fellow California intrastate carrier AirCal.

In 1986, USAir agreed to purchase PSA, the transaction closed in 1987 and PSA was integrated into USAir in 1988. The PSA acquisition gave USAir a network on the West Coast, but by 1991 USAir had largely withdrawn from California in the face of fierce fare wars driven, in significant part, by the spread of Southwest. Today&#x27;s American Airlines Group continues to protect the PSA trademark by using it as a name for a regional airline subsidiary, PSA Airlines. PSA did not survive for long after deregulation, but its influence lives on through the continued success of Southwest.

==History==

===Startup, early competition===
PSA started as an offshoot of San Diego–based Friedkin Aeronautics, the flight school Kenny Friedkin started to train returning GIs. When GI business dried up, on May 6, 1949, Friedkin started flying once a week from San Diego to Oakland via Burbank with a $1,000-a-month leased Douglas DC-3. Friedkin obtained information from a travel agent upon starting the airline due to lessons learned from a failed precursor airline (Friedkin Airlines). Reservations were initially taken at a World War II surplus latrine refitted as a ticket office. The original fare from Burbank to Oakland was $9.99. In July 1951 PSA added a flight to San Francisco. Oakland was dropped in 1954, but restored to the system in 1965. DC-3s went in and out of the fleet, but the total number was never more than four.

PSA was one of eight California intrastate carriers that started flying in the 13 month period from January 1949 through January 1950 - but only California Central Airlines (CCA) and PSA lasted longer than a year. CCA started in January 1949 and through its demise in February 1955 was larger, and flew better equipment (Martin 2-0-2s) than PSA. But CCA was not as focused as PSA (which stuck just to the San Diego to Bay Area route) and ultimately went bankrupt. PSA bid on CCA in the bankruptcy auction, but lost to a group composed of Allegheny Airlines and Southwest Airways (no relation to today&#x27;s Southwest Airlines) which shut CCA immediately, leaving PSA as the only intrastate competitor.


===Better aircraft, expansion===
In 1955, four Douglas DC-4s replaced the DC-3s, with PSA painting rectangles around the windows to make them resemble the more modern Douglas DC-6.

In January 1958, PSA scheduled 37 DC-4s a week Burbank to San Francisco (29 of which originated in San Diego) and four nonstops San Diego to San Francisco; United Airlines, Western Airlines and TWA then scheduled a total of 241 nonstop flights each week from Los Angeles to San Francisco, plus 49 flights a week from Burbank to San Francisco. About half of these flights by the competition were First Class only ($22.05); the rest carried coach passengers for $13.50, all fares subject to then 5% federal excise tax. In July 1958 PSA shifted some flights from Burbank to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX); that year it carried 296,000 passengers.

In late 1959, PSA began flying Lockheed Electra turboprops with 92 seats and a six-seat lounge, replacing 70-seat DC-4s. In 1963 PSA got its sixth Electra; by then it carried more passengers between the Bay Area and Los Angeles than any other airline. Total PSA passengers climbed from 355,000 in 1959 to 1,305,000 in 1963 and 5,162,000 in 1970.

===Public company===
On March 16, 1962, founder Kenny Friedkin, only 47 years old, died of a cerebral hemorrhage. He had lived to see his airline become a success, but it was still tiny, with only five aircraft. J. Floyd Andrews, one of Friedkin&#x27;s fellow founders, took over. Andrews&#x27;s era was tumultuous, PSA achieving a high national profile. This was the era of hot-pant clad flight attendants on pink-liveried aircraft, a classic image of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As discussed below, PSA became utterly dominant in the intra-California market, but also overreached to the point it almost went bankrupt.

Less than a year later, PSA went public, with a February 14, 1963, initial public offering, 313,000 shares (100,000 of them primary) at $19. Preparations had been underway for some time. PSA had an unusual corporate structure, with its aircraft owned through three companies owned by founders (Friedkin and others). In January 1962, these were merged into PSA. Prospectus facts that caught the eye of one observer included:
* With only five 98-seat Electras, PSA nonetheless had the second-highest passenger marketshare in San Francisco, and the fifth largest in Los Angeles.
* Speedy 20 minute aircraft turnarounds and no-frills service.
* Nine months profit to September 30, 1962, of over $1 million (at a time when the Los Angeles to San Francisco fare was just $13.50)
* 937,000 passengers carried between San Francisco and Los Angeles in 11 months ending November 30, 1962, compared to 642,000 in the same period the prior year.


=== CPUC era, 1965–1978 ===
Until 1965, as an intrastate airline PSA had a free hand in terms of how and where it flew within California. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) was limited to regulating PSA&#x27;s prices. So long as PSA stayed within the boundaries of an intrastate airline, the federal Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which otherwise tightly regulated US airlines, had no say, though as with any US airline, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operationally regulated PSA. As of September 17, 1965, the CPUC had new powers over California intrastate airlines of economic certification (PSA was grandfathered) route entry/exit and service quality (e.g. frequency).

PSA was in favor of this. In the early 1960s, a number of new entrant California intrastate carriers had come and gone, the most notorious being Paradise Airlines, which had a terrible accident in 1964. PSA believed it would benefit from market stability, but observers predicted that over time the CPUC would become just as restrictive as the CAB, which, in fact, happened. From 1965 through US airline deregulation in 1978, the CPUC certified only two intrastate airlines: Air California and Holiday Airlines. From September 17, 1965, through 1978, PSA had to apply to the CPUC for all new routes, generally in competition with Air California.

===Air California and lost opportunity===
Despite having total network freedom, PSA evolved its network minimally from 1949 to 1965: it served only five airports: San Diego, LAX, Burbank, San Francisco and Oakland. In 1965, Orange County Airport (later John Wayne Airport (SNA)), had a new runway. It approached PSA (among other airlines) about serving it (SNA had long-standing minimal service from Bonanza Air Lines), and like the others, PSA demurred. This was a mistake: 
* The CPUC certificated Air California to bring intrastate air service to Orange County, and the airport became a big deal. The County was the fastest growing in the nation in the 1960s, population increasing from 700K in 1960 to 1.4mm in 1970. There was a lot of demand for Orange County service.
* Having certificated Air California, the CPUC was open about its desire that Air California survive, so it kept PSA out of Orange County, gave other desirable routes to Air California and otherwise took steps to protect it. The CPUC assigned routes to PSA or Air California but rarely both. Despite a rocky first five years, Air California survived and the CPUC ensured minimal competition between it and PSA. 

PSA tried to buy Air California twice:
* In December 1969, an ailing Air California agreed to a merger, but the CPUC was slow to approve. In May 1970, PSA withdrew, citing the slow CPUC, and almost immediately thereafter, San Diego tycoon C. Arnholt Smith took control of Air California through his Westgate-California Corporation (WCC).
* In mid 1972, PSA agreed to buy WCC&#x27;s majority stake in Air California. Against heavy opposition, the CPUC agreed to the merger when WCC said it would no longer fund Air California losses. However, the US Department of Justice sued to prevent the merger, noting PSA had a 70% intra California market share and Air California had an 11% share. By now a year had passed. PSA withdrew from the merger after Air California auditors withdrew certification of 1971 and 1972 financial statements, one of the first steps in a scandal that enveloped C. Arnholt Smith including the 1973 seizure of his bank, the largest in San Diego, and the 1974 bankruptcy of WCC.

=== 1960s–1970s fleet ===
PSA’s fleet changed constantly in the 1960s and 1970s. The 1960s started with Electras, then Boeing 727-100s arrived in 1965, PSA&#x27;s first pure jet. The last Electra flight was September 1968 By 1969, PSA was swapping out 727-100s and replacing them with bigger 727-200s plus 737-200s. At the beginning of 1970, the fleet comprised one 727-100, 16 727-200s and nine 737s. In the late 1960s PSA also briefly had DC-9s, the justification was to train pilots of other airlines. As discussed below, the L-1011s made a brief appearance in 1974-1975, but by then PSA was shedding the 737s; the last left in the fleet in 1976. In 1975, Lockheed Electras returned to support flights to Tahoe (see below). Other than the Electras (required to operate to Tahoe), PSA settled on 727s in the late 1970s, acquiring used 727-100s as well as additional new 727-200s. 

PSA entered Tahoe after Holiday Airlines collapsed. Holiday basically served nowhere other than Tahoe, a choice that sealed its fate. PSA applied to the CPUC for Holiday&#x27;s routes in 1974 Holiday said it couldn’t afford to defend itself in front of the CPUC and went out of business in February 1975. The CPUC split the Tahoe routes between Air California and PSA on an emergency basis, but required the two carriers use Electras for Tahoe. One of PSA&#x27;s first actions of the deregulated era (which started January 1, 1979) was to exit Tahoe, citing the high cost of Electras in a fleet that otherwise comprised 31 727s.

In 1967 PSA was finally allowed to use offshore airway V25 to San Diego, despite being an intrastate airline.

===Attempted Western Air Lines merger===
An early indication that, for J. Floyd Andrews, PSA was not enough came in December 1968 with an audacious bid for Western Air Lines, then under attack by Kirk Kerkorian. Western was four times the revenue of PSA, and as an interstate carrier, regulated by the CAB. It was unclear how this would work, putting together two airlines with different regulators, whether CAB approval would be forthcoming. PSA pulled the bid in April 1969, citing deteriorating Western results. By that time, Kerkorian was, while not a majority owner of Western, difficult to dislodge, controlling nine out of 21 seats on the board. As outlined in a section below, PSA instead pursued a non-airline acquisition strategy.

===Southwest Airlines===
Southwest Airlines was founded in 1967, but grueling legal challenges caused its operational start to be delayed until June 1971. Founder Rollin King took inspiration from PSA. Founding president Lamar Muse was open about the debt to PSA, saying &quot;we don&#x27;t mind being copycats of an operation like that&quot;, including hotpants. PSA hosted King and Muse for a four day visit in 1971 and gave them a copy of PSA&#x27;s FAA operating manuals, from which Southwest created its own in what Muse said was &quot;primarily a copy-and-paste procedure&quot;. PSA helping Southwest made sense in 1971, with each airline strictly limited to flying within its state and seemingly no prospect of that ever changing. Mutual admiration was expressed monetarily: in 1978, Southwest management and directors owned 6% of PSA, while PSA directors and management owned 10% of Southwest.

===Laid low by diversification and widebodies===

In July 1968, PSA bought rental car company Valcar, a former Hertz subsidiary with a west-coast presence. Like PSA, Valcar had a budget orientation, but PSA couldn&#x27;t make it work and shut it down in 1971, after failing to sell it.

In April 1969, PSA bought the San Franciscan Hotel in downtown San Francisco. In June, PSA bought the Islandia in San Diego&#x27;s Mission Bay. In June 1971, PSA committed to a to-be constructed hotel at the Los Angeles Hollywood Park Racetrack (now the site of SoFi Stadium), and in December 1971, committed to a to-be constructed hotel within the Queen Mary attraction in Long Beach The synergies were not obvious. None of the hotels were located at airports, none of them were value-oriented. In 1973, CEO Andrews called the hotels &quot;a complete flop&quot; and in 1974 gave three of them to Hyatt to run. It took years for PSA to extricate itself. In 1979, PSA finally sold the San Franciscan but had yet to sell the Queen Mary hotel.

In August 1970, PSA started buying radio stations. By 1975, its four stations were for sale. PSA also bought a catamaran. In 1973, PSA created a holding company, &quot;PSA, Inc.&quot; for the airline and many non-airline subsidiaries.
In late summer 1970, PSA ordered five Lockheed L-1011 widebody aircraft, deliveries starting 1972. In the next 12 months, the L-1011 engine maker, Rolls-Royce, went bankrupt, and Lockheed required a US government bailout to avoid the same. In December 1971, PSA cancelled the order, but Lockheed said it couldn&#x27;t. In September 1972, PSA signed a new order, deliveries starting 1974. PSA grounded its two L-1011s after eight months. A 300 seat aircraft never made sense in a business model that depended on quick aircraft turnarounds. Economics presented to the CPUC showed L-1011 per-seat costs no better than a 727 despite being twice as large. PSA refused the last three aircraft and was stuck paying a 15-year lease on the first two. It entered into years of litigation with Lockheed.

By 1975, losses from diversification and L-1011s brought PSA to the brink of bankruptcy. Operating losses on rental cars, radio stations and hotels through 1974 (not including cost of acquisition) were almost $9M. Through 1977, PSA lost another $1M on discontinued businesses and recognized $18mm in L-1011 losses. In 1982, PSA took another $4.2M loss against its two L-1011s, still unable to find a home for them. PSA&#x27;s troubles attracted national attention. PSA went to the CPUC asking for a fare increase to bail them out. The CPUC excoriated PSA, questioning management competency at length and especially withering about a 1974 $8mm share buyback. In March 1976, J. Floyd Andrews gave up the CEO position, and in May, resigned as chair of the board.

===Getting out from under the CPUC===
As airline deregulation was being debated, for most of the country, it promised lower prices. But California already had lower prices, set by the CPUC. By comparison, in Texas, Southwest Airlines set its own fares, the Texas Aeronautics Commission didn’t get involved. The concern (and expectation) was deregulation would lead to higher prices. California legislators and governor Jerry Brown wanted the CPUC to remain in charge of any airline that did over 50% of its business in California. This amendment was voted down in the relevant US House of Representatives subcommittee by one vote. Instead, deregulation as passed included strong Federal preemption – states had little say over an airline with a Federal certificate.
By then, the CPUC had become the restrictive bureaucracy observers had predicted when it was given additional powers in 1965, second-guessing (in glacial and burdensome processes that could and did last for years) everything California intrastate carriers did, and even itself, as exemplified in the role the CPUC played in the 1975 demise of Holiday Airlines. PSA also played a special role at the CPUC. It was assumed to be the most efficient carrier, therefore CPUC fares were set relative to what would make the highest permissible profit for PSA – all other carriers operating in California then had to toe that line. So PSA had ample reason to regret its support of that 1965 legislation. However, under the Airline Deregulation Act, the minute PSA started flying to Nevada in December 1978, it was free of the CPUC. The CPUC didn’t take that lying down. The CPUC sued in Federal court to overturn the Airline Deregulation Act, lost, appealed, and lost again. 

===Flight 182===
As the regulated era drew to a close, PSA suffered a terrible crash in September 1978 when a 727 collided with a small plane over San Diego, fatal to all on both aircraft and to some on the ground. It was made worse for PSA by:
* The presence of so many deadheading employees on the aircraft. 37 PSA employees died out of 135.
* The fact that San Diego was the company&#x27;s hometown.
* The culpability of the flight crew. It was responsible for keeping track of the small aircraft, but lost focus.

===Harold Simmons===
1978 wasn&#x27;t through with PSA yet. At the end of 1978 it transpired corporate raider Harold Simmons had accumulated a 20% stake. When PSA, appealing to investors, referred to a 30-year history of success, Simmons printed ads summarizing PSA’s far-from-successful 1970s financials and noting 1977 profits were about half those of 1971, despite revenues almost twice as large. But as PSA said, Andrews was gone. Simmons evinced no desire to &quot;destroy&quot; PSA, seeing it instead as a takeover candidate from which he could profit. PSA won a shareholder vote to implement takeover defenses with just a bit more than 50% but the company had post-dated the shareholder record date to ensure Simmons couldn’t vote his whole stake. Simmons said he’d sue. In the end, PSA paid him off by giving him some aircraft in exchange for his stake. To be fair, notwithstanding Flight 182, PSA’s 1978 financials were somewhat better, but significantly flattered by an accounting change.

===PSA on the brink of deregulation===
As PSA headed towards deregulation, both the airline and Wall Street thought it would be a winner. But in December 1978, Paul Barkley, then PSA’s chief operating officer (later CEO), spoke about the deregulated future a few weeks away. He expected something fairly sedate, quite different from the bitter Darwinistic struggle that would engulf the industry:
* Discounted airfares would fade away due to a shortage of aircraft and “passenger capacity”. Another factor against discount airfares was that they were too hard to administer.
* Capacity would be tight through the mid-1980s due to lack of aircraft
* The airline industry would be healthier in deregulation, there would be no revolutionary changes. Competition would not be intense, again, due to lack of aircraft.


===Striking out in Texas===
Dallas-Fort Worth–based Braniff International Airways was the first trunk carrier to fail after deregulation. US trunk airlines were the descendants of the original 16 airlines certified by the CAB and thereafter regulated to be the main US carriers. Braniff had been successful just prior to deregulation, but Harding Lawrence, Braniff’s imperious long-time leader, expanded the carrier excessively immediately after deregulation, resulting in its May 1982 bankruptcy and shut-down. Until Continental did so in 1983, no one knew an airline could recover from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In October 1982, PSA announced a cheap and low-risk deal to expand into a new geography: under an eight year contract, Braniff would fly 25 to 30 727s from its Texas base with PSA colors and marketing, employing 1,500 Braniff employees (who would have to agree to lower wages and higher productivity) as well as gates and takeoff/landing slots. These slots were key Braniff assets. In the wake of the August 1981 air traffic controllers strike, the FAA had limited air traffic control capacity, so allocated each airline takeoff/landing slots at specific airports. When Braniff collapsed, those rights were temporarily allocated to others. If Braniff flew again, it could recover those rights, grounding some operations at other carriers. It was a strong competitive lever.

The initial deal failed when Braniff pilots refused to agree to lower seniority than PSA pilots in the event PSA ever merged with the PSA-Braniff operation (to ensure PSA pilots always got first pick of flying). Pride as well as pay was in play: PSA was perceived as junior-league relative to Braniff. A new deal with Braniff simply equipped a new carrier with Braniff equipment to fly under contract to PSA, sidestepping Braniff’s unions. Braniff would even loan PSA the funds. Further, the FAA noted if Braniff resumed flying it was entitled to its takeoff/landing slots, but a new airline that just happened to use Braniff assets was not. The deal died in March 1983. A second iteration of Braniff did start flying in 1984 without PSA help, ultimately without success, possible due to Texas already being home to Southwest (which, expanding westward, had already entered PSA’s home city of San Diego in January 1982), American Airlines (which viewed Dallas-Fort Worth as its own, having moved its headquarters there in 1979) and Continental Airlines, which in 1983 would go through a bankruptcy that dramatically lowered its costs.

Meanwhile, PSA was making money, but not by flying passengers. In 1982 and 1981 it sold aircraft and tax credits on aircraft to make a net profit while still producing an operating loss.

===Disappointing deregulation performance===
In the years prior to deregulation, PSA said it must be ready for the day it was able to fly outside of California. When the day came, PSA management saw themselves as one of the natural beneficiaries of deregulation (see prior sections). But in fact, PSA did poorly. As the nearby table shows, AirCal’s nominal growth from 1978 (the last year of regulation) to 1985 was double that of PSA, Southwest was nearly triple. Perhaps most striking was the comparison of PSA with Piedmont Airlines, which pre-deregulation had been a local service airline regulated by the CAB. Piedmont was smaller than PSA in 1978 but well over twice its size in 1985. Piedmont also had an unbroken string of profits since deregulation. 


A July 1984 Los Angeles Times article noted PSA had been hanging fire since deregulation; management always waiting for some obstacle to clear. For instance, waiting to swap out the 727 fleet it had at deregulation (yet the abortive 1982/1983 Braniff deal would have doubled-down on 727s), which were too large and too fuel inefficient (given the rise in fuel prices, which PSA also blamed) and too labor intensive (given its three person cockpit vs two places for the MD-80). 727s were a big factor in driving the company to ordering 20 BAe-146 aircraft in late 1983, which were both smaller and extremely quiet (an advantage in California where noise politics was a factor at airports like Orange County, Long Beach and Burbank). PSA may have overcorrected – PSA ultimately configured BAe-146s with only 85 seats vs 150 for the MD-80s and 175 for the 727-200s. In one respect, PSA was lucky: the BAe-146 was eventually notorious for fairly significant engine problems that PSA management never had to deal with because it sold the company before they became well known. As a stopgap, the airline also acquired four 110-seat used DC-9s from Air Canada in 1983. PSA did not prioritize a single fleet type.

But if looking for reasons for underperformance, management might have considered itself, since it was of long-standing. William Shimp, CEO and Chairman from 1976 to 1984, joined PSA in 1949. Paul Barkley, who succeeded Shimp, had been a C-suite officer at PSA since 1967. Notwithstanding the disastrous experience of the 1970s, management never lost its taste for diversification, diverting corporate attention from the airline. PSA, Inc.&#x27;s 1983 annual report noted energy subsidiaries involved in fuel supply and distribution and oil and gas exploration and production, as well as aviation-related subsidiaries providing engine maintenance, aircraft leasing and flight training.

===Employee givebacks, PS Group, sale to USAir and Flight 1771===
In 1984, following another poor year in 1983, PSA asked for wage givebacks from airline employees. Employees would reduce pay by 15% in exchange for 15% of pre-tax airline profits and a 15% stake in the airline. Note, &quot;airline profits&quot;, not the holding company, PSA, Inc., which included aircraft leasing and fuel distribution among other businesses. After some back-and-forth, employees went along with this in late 1984. Employees got to nominate four directors to the airline board. Famed retailer Sol Price of Price Club (a Costco constituent) and FedMart was one such employee director. Another requirement was a separate publicly-traded stock for the airline. On July 28, 1986, there was an initial public offering for the airline (1.8mm shares at $7). Meanwhile, to eliminate confusion, the parent company (which retained its own stock listing) was renamed &quot;PS Group, Inc.&quot;. In the midst of this activity, the holding company continued to diversify. In September 1985, it added to its oil and gas investments.

1986 was the year of the airline merger – Republic into Northwest, Ozark into TWA, Western into Delta Air Lines and others. In November, AirCal accepted an offer from American Airlines. On December 8, USAir announced an agreement to purchase PSA for $400mm. The combination had its skeptics: USAir’s pre-PSA California presence was 12 flights per day to Pittsburgh and Indianapolis so its brand awareness among Californians was minimal.
The purchase closed May 29, 1987, but PSA and USAir pilot union chapters fought over transition agreements, delaying the merger of PSA into USAir beyond the original January 1, 1988, date.
PSA thus still existed under USAir ownership when on December 7, 1987, a fired USAir employee used his credentials (which had not been recovered from him) to sneak a gun on board PSA Flight 1771. En-route, he shot, among others, the flightcrew, causing the aircraft to crash, killing everyone on board. The fact pattern of a (former) USAir employee killing PSA crew and passengers overshadowed the last days of PSA.

PSA finally merged into USAir on April 9, 1988. PS Group had long since banked what it was paid for its PSA, creating a well-funded life-raft for select former PSA executives, among which Chairman Paul Barkley. By the time the merger was consummated, PS Group had used some the PSA money to buy a stake in a travel agency business, to go along with its aircraft leasing and oil &amp; gas interests.

==Legacy==
The successors of PSA and AirCal, USAir and American, raised prices, reflecting their higher costs. In early 1990, the last-minute roundtrip fare from Los Angeles to Sacramento was $456, over $1000 in 2024 dollars. State legislators were increasingly irate, finally proposing a raft of bills to punish the carriers, even suggesting a state-owned airline, but the market had already taken care of the problem. United Airlines had already announced an increase in frequency on Los Angeles to San Francisco from 16 to 27 per day and Southwest Airlines had announced it was entering Burbank with 10 a day service to Oakland at a last-minute fare of $59 one way, $29 in advance.

The resulting Los Angeles Basin to San Francisco Bay fare war was brutal, made worse when Iraq invaded Kuwait thereby spiking oil prices, collapsing demand for international travel and tipping the US into the Gulf War. In January 1991, in announcements only two weeks apart, first American and then USAir gutted the former AirCal and PSA systems, throwing in the towel less than five years after offering to buy the former intrastate airlines.

The indirect legacy of PSA is Southwest Airlines, originally a Texas intrastate airline that PSA inspired. Southwest inspired low-cost airlines globally. PSA therefore was a key company in the advent of low-cost air travel.

Another legacy stems from Kenny Friedkin&#x27;s son Thomas H. Friedkin, a PSA pilot in 1962 when his father died. A year later, Tom&#x27;s mother (Kenny&#x27;s widow) died, making him the largest PSA shareholder. Tom had a seat on the Board of Directors but continued as a full-time pilot for the airline. Tom astutely invested in a Toyota distributorship in the late 1960s, Gulf States Toyota, now a multi-billion dollar business run by Tom&#x27;s son, Kenny&#x27;s grandson, Dan Friedkin.

==Corporate culture==

PSA was known for its sense of humor. Founder Ken Friedkin wore Hawaiian shirts and encouraged his pilots and stewardesses to joke with passengers. Its slogan was &quot;The World&#x27;s Friendliest Airline&quot;, and its recognizable trademark was a smile painted on the nose of each plane and an accompanying advertising campaign declaring &quot;Catch Our Smile&quot;. Because of the major San Diego flight schedule and its discount fares, military personnel nicknamed PSA the &quot;Poor Sailor&#x27;s Airline.&quot; After PSA was bought by USAir, ex-PSA mechanics would occasionally paint smiles on USAir planes as a joke.
In the 1960s PSA was known for the brightly colored flight attendant uniforms, with miniskirts; in the early 1970s the fashion changed to hotpants. A PSA flight attendant, Marilyn Tritt, wrote a book about her tenure at the company titled &quot;Long Legs and Short Nights&quot;.

Throughout PSA&#x27;s lifetime, the flight attendants, with their humor, over-the-top passenger service, and sense of duty, helped to create a loyal passenger following. One flight attendant, Sandy Daniels, with the help of a frequent flyer, started the &quot;Precious Stewardess Association&quot;. Frequent fliers would bring tasty treats to the crew, particularly on morning flights. In turn, PSA started the &quot;Precious Passenger Association&quot;, with certificates and free drinks given to friendly and helpful passengers.

==Headquarters==
PSA headquarters were a windowless gray-brown building on Harbor Drive in San Diego, California. The building was San Diego International Airport&#x27;s commuter terminal until 2015 when it was converted into administrative offices of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On January 15, 1969, PSA Flight 990, a Boeing 727-100 registered as N973PS, collided with Cessna 182 N42242 while it was climbing to its cruising altitude. Both aircraft were in controlled airspace on the same frequency. The 727 continued on to Ontario, CA and made a safe landing. The Cessna lost its right wingtip and three-quarters of its right aileron, so the pilot decided returned to San Francisco. The pilot decided to cut his engine and managed to glide to San Francisco International Airport without any further incident. A passenger on board the Boeing 727 reported that he had seen a light plane fly very close to the aircraft.
*On March 5, 1974, a PSA NAMC YS-11 training aircraft&#x27;s engines failed, resulting in the aircraft crashing in the desert near Borrego Springs, California. The turboprop aircraft was doing a simulated landing stall. All of the four crew members survived the crash. The aircraft was written off.
*On September 25, 1978, PSA Flight 182, a Boeing 727-200, crashed in San Diego while trying to land at Lindbergh Field, California, after colliding with a Cessna 172. All 135 aboard the PSA flight were killed, as were the two in the Cessna and seven on the ground. At the time, it was the deadliest plane crash in U.S. airspace; it remains the worst mid-air collision in the United States. A lawsuit argued by Gary Aguirre resulted in a verdict against PSA for damages. 
*On December 7, 1987, PSA Flight 1771, a BAe 146, bound for San Francisco from Los Angeles, was airborne above the California central coast when it entered a high-speed nosedive and crashed near the town of Cayucos in San Luis Obispo County. Investigations determined that David Burke, a former US Air employee who had been fired for theft, armed himself and boarded the flight, which was carrying his former manager. After writing a note on an air sickness bag, Burke shot his ex-manager, a flight attendant, both pilots and the airline&#x27;s chief pilot. Burke then pushed down on the control column, causing the aircraft to enter a dive. There were no survivors among the 38 passengers and five crew.

===Hijackings===
There were other attempted hijackings which resulted in no injuries and the surrender of the hijacker(s). These incidents are not included. The following are notable hijackings because of fatalities or because the aircraft flew to another country:
* On January 7, 1972, PSA Flight 902, a Boeing 727-200 flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles was hijacked to Cuba. The captain negotiated the release of the passengers in Los Angeles and the hijackers, who had with them a baby and were armed with a shotgun and other arms, proceeded to Cuba, with a fueling stop in Tampa. Three flight attendants and three off-duty flight attendants accompanied the flight to Cuba.
* On July 5, 1972, PSA Flight 710, a Boeing 737-200 flight from Sacramento to San Francisco was hijacked with demands to fly to the Soviet Union. The plane was stormed while on the ground at San Francisco, resulting in the deaths of one passenger and the two hijackers. One of the passengers, who survived being shot in the back, was the actor Victor Sen Yung, best known as Hop Sing from the &quot;Bonanza&quot; television series. One other passenger was shot and survived.

<text>Ta Kung Pao (; formerly L&#x27;Impartial in Latin-based languages) is a Chinese-language newspaper. Founded in Tianjin in 1902, the paper is state-owned, controlled by the Liaison Office of the Central Government after the Chinese Civil War. It is widely regarded as a veteran pro-Beijing newspaper. In 2016, it merged with Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the parent company of &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;, Guangdong Xin Wenhua, to be &quot;Captured Public or State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

==History==

In the final years of the Qing dynasty, Ying Lianzhi, a Catholic Manchu aristocrat, founded the newspaper in Tianjin on 17 June 1902, in order to, &quot;help China become a modern and democratic nation&quot;. The paper put forward the slogan &quot;Four Noes&quot; () in its early years, pledging to say &quot;No&quot; to all political parties, governments, commercial companies, and persons.
It stood up to the repression at the time, openly criticising the Empress Dowager Cixi and reactionary leaders, and promoted democratic reforms, pioneering the use of written vernacular Chinese (&quot;baihua&quot;). Readership fell after the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 and bought it in 1916. Still, the newspaper was out of business by 1925 due to the lack of readership. On 1 September 1926, however, , Hu Zhengzhi, re-established the newspaper in Tianjin. With &quot;no party affiliation, no political endorsement, no self-promotion, no ignorance&quot; () as its motto, the newspaper&#x27;s popularity quickly rose again because of its sharp political commentary, especially of the Japanese as the Second Sino-Japanese War began.

As the war raged on, the newspaper&#x27;s staff fled to other cities, such as Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Guilin and Hong Kong, to continue publishing, but local editions were abandoned as the Japanese captured more and more territory. After the war was won, , the chief editor, re-established the Shanghai edition on 1 November 1945, in the format and style of the old Shanghai edition. They had also planned to issue editions for other cities, including Guangzhou, but the Chinese Civil War forced this proposal to be shelved. &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; supported the Kuomintang at the beginning of the Civil War, but switched its sympathies to the Chinese Communist Party after the repression of intellectuals, hyper-inflation, and other violent purges of political opponents by the Kuomintang.

In March 1948, the Hong Kong edition was re-established. A major newspaper during the Republican years, it continued to be influential after re-publication by Fei Yi Ming, the subsequent publisher in Hong Kong after 1949, as one of few newspapers that survived foreign invasion and civil war. In April 1952, the colonial authorities in Hong Kong tried the newspaper&#x27;s proprietor, publisher, and its editor for violation of the Sedition Ordinance. &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;, along with the &quot;New Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot;, were charged with inciting an uprising by negatively reporting on the colonial authorities&#x27; response to a fire in Tung Tau Tsuen. As a result, &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;&#x27;s leadership was fined, jailed, and ordered to cease reporting for six months.

A mass demonstration began in 1953 after protesters became dissatisfied with the Hong Kong government following a fire in the Tung Tau squatter area. The government in Guangzhou began fundraising to support the protesters and decided to dispatch a relief delegation to Hong Kong on 1 March 1952. The trip was cancelled after opposition from the Hong Kong government, and protests began on the same day targeting the Hong Kong police. &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; and other publications supporting the Chinese government produced frequent reports emphasising the Hong Kong government&#x27;s neglect of the poor. On March 5, &quot;New Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; and &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; reprinted an editorial from &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, the newspaper of the CCP Central Committee but removed references to &quot;massacre of our countrymen&quot; to avoid violating Hong Kong&#x27;s Sedition Ordinance. However, the Hong Kong government accused the newspapers of sedition. &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;, its owner Fei Yiming and publisher Li Zongying received to nine and six months of prison sentence and fined a few thousand Hong Kong dollars. The newspaper was also ordered to stop publishing for six months.

Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai then issued a statement demanding Hong Kong to stop the prosecution. The British government told Hong Kong authorities days later to rescind the court sentence against &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;, its owner and its publisher, and the newspaper was allowed to publish again after 12 days of suspension. 

In January 2019, &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; published an article stating that a &quot;secret envoy&quot; of president Tsai Ing-wen had met with three Hong Kong localist camp activists from the pro-independence group Studentlocalism. However, the &quot;secret envoy&quot; was actually Su Yong-yao, a senior political reporter for &quot;Liberty Times&quot;, a Taiwanese newspaper. The article was in turn criticized by the Taiwanese presidential office as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;a piece of fake news&quot;.

During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; published antisemitic George Soros conspiracy theories, displaying Soros as a reptile in collusion with Jimmy Lai. In 2020, &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; frequently attacked judges perceived as siding with pro-democracy protesters, causing Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma to make an 18-page plea against attacking judges and the judiciary system. In November 2020, the Hong Kong Bar Association (HKBA) published a letter to Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng, accusing &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; of publishing false material that claimed judge Anderson Chow was being supportive of criminal activities. The HKBA asked Teresa Cheng to protect the city&#x27;s judges against false accusations.

In May 2023, the newspaper attacked housing and urban planning NGO Liber Research Community, saying the NGO was &quot;taking things out of context with groundless evidence.&quot;

In 2024, the newspaper partnered with the Heilongjiang Daily Newspaper Group to establish the Heilongjiang International Communication Center.

==Organization==

The paper is state-owned, controlled by the Liaison Office of the Central Government in Hong Kong. The head office of &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; is located on Hennessy Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong Island, with offices in mainland China, such as in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Inner-Mongolia and Guangzhou.

The paper&#x27;s Asia-Pacific head office is in Hing Wai Centre (), Tin Wan, Aberdeen, Hong Kong. Its China head office is in Chaoyang District, Beijing. Previously the head office was in Kodak House Phase 2 (), North Point, Hong Kong.

<text>Rockhurst University is a private Jesuit university in Kansas City, Missouri. Founded in 1910 as Rockhurst College, Rockhurst University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It enrolled 2,980 students in 2019.

==History==
In 1909, Fr. Michael Dowling, S.J., the founder of Rockhurst, purchased of land at 53rd Street and Troost Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri for $50,000. Rockhurst was chartered by the state as Rockhurst College in August 1910. It included the Academy of Rockhurst College, an institution of secondary education which became Rockhurst High School in 1923, though the two remained under a single corporate umbrella until the high school moved onto its own campus in 1962.

Sedgwick Hall was constructed in 1914, allowing the opening of high school classes, and college classes began in 1917, all held within the same building. The first Rockhurst University students were all taught by Alphonse Schwitalla. The first class graduated in 1921. In 1939, Rockhurst was granted accreditation by the North Central Association. In 1969, all divisions of Rockhurst became coeducational. Its name change to Rockhurst University became official on July 1, 1999. In October 2006, Rockhurst officially installed its fourteenth president, Thomas Curran, a Catholic priest and the school&#x27;s first non-Jesuit president. In May 2015, Curran took his finals vows to become a Jesuit. Rockhurst and Research College of Nursing jointly announced in 2018 that they were ending their partnership. In 2020, Saint Luke&#x27;s College of Health Sciences merged with Rockhurst University to form the Saint Luke&#x27;s College of Nursing and Health Sciences at Rockhurst University.

==Service education==
Rockhurst University adheres to a traditional Ignatian philosophy of educating students not only in academics, but in leadership and service as well. The university stresses a values and ethics based education with an emphasis on lifelong learning. Graduates from Rockhurst University receive two transcripts: one for academics and another for community service. 97% of all students participate in community service, and every year students complete over 25,000 hours of service to the Kansas City area and worldwide community. Before classes even begin in the fall, the freshmen class joins with upperclassmen and university Regents for the Finucane Service Project as part of the Orientation program. Over 550 people participated in the Finucane project last fall, logging over 1,200 hours of service in a two-hour period. The university sponsors numerous annual service trips within the United States, as well as in Guatemala, Belize, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, El Salvador, The Bahamas and other developing countries.

In recognition of its dedication to community service programs, including the number of people who participate in service and the number of service-learning courses, Rockhurst was recognized on the 2008 President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll with Distinction, among only 127 schools in the country and one of nine Jesuit schools to receive that honor. Rockhurst has continued to receive this distinction every year since 2007.

In addition to the service completed by its student body, Rockhurst has been recognized as a university by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching with the foundation&#x27;s community engagement classification for its ongoing engagement with its neighborhood and the Kansas City community. Rockhurst was first school in the Kansas City area to receive this honor.

==Campus==

Rockhurst sits on a campus located in Kansas City&#x27;s cultural district, a short distance from the popular shopping and dining center, Country Club Plaza, and just across Troost Avenue from the neighboring University of Missouri–Kansas City.

===Housing===

The campus is home to three residence halls and the Townhouse Village, offering housing for interested students, as well as university-owned houses on two streets adjacent to campus. McGee Hall typically houses only freshmen women, while Corcoran Hall houses primarily freshmen men. Xavier-Loyola Hall is a co-ed residence hall for upper-class students, mainly consisting of sophomores and juniors, with male and female students living in separate wings. The Townhouse Village houses upper-class students in apartment-style living, with a full kitchen, dining room, living room, and two or three bedrooms. Upper-class students can also apply to live in university-owned houses on residential streets adjacent to campus, giving them the opportunity to live more independently. These houses are deemed &quot;on-campus&quot; and hold groups of 3 to 6 residents.

===The quad===

The main area of campus, including all classroom buildings, surrounds the quad with the monumental Rockhurst bell tower and adjacent pergola flanking one end. In 2007 the quad has been renamed the Kinerk Commons by the university, in honor of Edward Kinerk, the thirteenth president of the university. The recently renovated Conway Hall is home to the Helzberg School of Management, the university finance office, and university computer services. Sedgwick Hall contains classrooms and faculty offices as well as the Mabee Theatre, where the university&#x27;s players have put on four productions each year. The Greenlease Library holds the school&#x27;s volumes of reference books and periodicals. The science center, built in 1996, holds the science classrooms and labs, as well as the doctoral program in physical therapy and doctoral program in occupational therapy. VanAckeren Hall holds the education department, the learning center (open to all students for free tutoring and writing help), and career services, which helps students find jobs and internships across the Midwest. Massman Hall is the center of the campus, both physically and organizationally. The admissions, business, student development, and administrative offices are all in Massman, as well as the cafeteria, the student pub, a coffee shop, Mabee Chapel, a fully equipped fitness and workout facility, and the Rock Room, which is a 24-hour recreational lounge for students.

A major addition to the Rockhurst campus was Arrupe Hall, opening in August 2015, a classroom and faculty office building which includes a 500-seat auditorium. It features versatile classrooms accommodating modern teaching methods and technologies and has a variety of small gathering spaces along the corridors to facilitate sharing and friendship among the students. It was also built with a view to energy conservation and openness to natural light. Its name honors the vision of Jesuit Superior General Pedro Arrupe who coined the term &quot;men and women for others&quot; that has become integral to Jesuit education, and who &quot;called the Society to the service of faith and the promotion of justice. His call clearly resonates with the message from (Jesuit) Pope Francis.&quot;

===Athletic facilities===
The campus has several athletic facilities, including the soccer stadium, recently renovated with new grass-like turf, a baseball stadium, softball field, and a tennis complex. The Mason-Halpin Fieldhouse holds the basketball and volleyball court, and the adjacent Convocation Center contains a multipurpose court and racquetball courts. The Magis Activity Center, built in 2019, houses workout facilities for students and faculty.

===Religious worship facilities===

The Campus Ministry Center (CMC) is located in a house adjacent to campus. The CMC is used by the many Campus Ministry programs for their weekly meetings and activities, including the Christian Life Communities (CLCs), student-led faith sharing and reflection groups. Within Massman Hall is the Mabee Chapel, where daily mass is held each school day, and where student devotional prayer and praise-and-worship groups meet weekly. Across the street from campus is St. Francis Xavier Church, a Jesuit parish church, used by the university for student masses every Sunday evening.

===Community center===
The Rockhurst University Community Center is located at 54th and Troost, where children&#x27;s literacy programs, community programs, and the RU College Bound high school tutoring program all are held. The Community Center serves as a physical link between the university and the surrounding neighborhood.

==Academics==

Rockhurst University offers over fifty graduate and undergraduate programs, serving over 3,000 students annually. The core undergraduate curriculum is designed to shape students into leaders who are engaged in the world around them in whatever path they choose, and the graduate programs aim to prepare professional leaders with a hands-on curriculum, nationally recognized faculty and flexible schedules. Rockhurst University operates under one president, but has the following schools with their own deans or directors: College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business, Influence, and Information Analysis, and Saint Luke&#x27;s College of Nursing and Health Sciences.

In 2018, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Rockhurst University as the 11th best institution among Midwest regional universities, up from No. 15 in previous years. The Helzberg School of Management earned several top accolades, including the school&#x27;s undergraduate management program listed at No. 11 (tied with the University of Notre Dame), and the undergraduate quantitative analysis program listed at No. 9 (one spot behind the University of Michigan).

==Campus ministry==

Rockhurst University&#x27;s campus ministry offers many opportunities for students and staff to live out the school&#x27;s Catholic, Jesuit tradition. They offer daily mass in the Mabee Chapel every weekday at noon, as well as a student mass every Sunday at 6:00 pm at St. Francis Xavier Parish. Campus ministry also offers RCIA to any interested students.

Christian Life Communities (CLCs) are student-led faith-sharing and reflection groups that meet for an hour each week as small groups. Unity, a gay-straight alliance that meets weekly for prayer, support and service, is open to students of all faith traditions and sexual orientations. Voices for Justice is a student-led social justice group that explores the justice implications of Christianity and raises awareness of social justice issues on campus and beyond. People for People is a group of students exploring issues relating to the respect for life.

The Campus Ministry Center (CMC) is a house located just off-campus across Rockhurst Road from Conway Hall. Christian Life Communities, Voices for Justice, Unity, and People for People all hold their meetings in the CMC, and Campus Ministry offers several social activities in the CMC during the school year.

===Retreats===
Campus Ministry runs several different retreat programs during the academic year. The Frosh Getaway, offered annually on a September weekend, is an opportunity for freshmen, led by sophomore leaders, to get to know their new classmates and to adjust to college life with a fun stress-free weekend. The Retreat on the Rock is designed as a college adaptation of Kairos-style retreats. The Fifth Week Retreat is intended as a follow-up to Kairos, Search, TEC, Retreat on the Rock, or similar style retreats, offering ample time for personal reflection and group discussion. The Busy Persons Retreat, offered annually in the spring, is an opportunity for spiritual guidance and reflection within the context and schedule demands of daily college life. The SuperNatural Christian&#x27;s retreat is a six-day backpacking retreat in upper Michigan&#x27;s Sylvania Wilderness Tract. This retreat is offered biannually along with the Lumberjack Service Retreat, which offers students the chance to travel to Michigan&#x27;s Keweenaw Peninsula (specifically the town of Hancock) and chop wood for elderly residents of the area.

==Athletics==

Rockhurst University is home to the Hawks, the university&#x27;s athletic program. After a generation in the NAIA, Rockhurst University joined NCAA Division II in 1999, as a founder of the Heartland Conference. In 2005 it moved to the Great Lakes Valley Conference. In July 2009 the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) rejected a proposal for Rockhurst to join the conference to compete with geographically closer teams. The MIAA said at that moment it currently did not want to expand beyond 12 teams.

Rockhurst has 15 varsity athletic teams, including men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, soccer, golf, lacrosse and tennis, men&#x27;s baseball, women&#x27;s softball, and women&#x27;s volleyball. The school also offers two club sports: tennis and the Spirit Squad, composed of the Dance Team and the coed cheerleading squad. It is a popular joke around campus that the Rockhurst University football team has remained undefeated since 1949 (the year that the team was dissolved).

<text>Glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid or glycyrrhizinic acid) is the chief sweet-tasting constituent of &quot;Glycyrrhiza glabra&quot; (liquorice) root. Structurally, it is a saponin used as an emulsifier and gel-forming agent in foodstuffs and cosmetics. Its aglycone is enoxolone.

==Pharmacokinetics==
After oral ingestion, glycyrrhizin is hydrolysed to 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (enoxolone) by intestinal bacteria. After absorption from the gut, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid is metabolised to 3β-monoglucuronyl-18β-glycyrrhetinic acid in the liver. This metabolite circulates in the bloodstream. Consequently, its oral bioavailability is poor. Most of it is eliminated by bile and only a minor part (0.31–0.67%) by urine. After oral ingestion of 600 mg of glycyrrhizin the metabolite appeared in urine after 1.5 to 14 hours. Maximal concentrations (0.49 to 2.69 mg/L) were achieved after 1.5 to 39 hours and metabolite can be detected in the urine after 2 to 4 days.

==Flavouring properties==
Glycyrrhizin is obtained as an extract from licorice root after maceration and boiling in water. Licorice extract (glycyrrhizin) is sold in the United States as a liquid, paste, or spray-dried powder. When in specified amounts, it is approved for use as a flavor and aroma in manufactured foods, beverages, candies, dietary supplements, and seasonings. It is 30 to 50 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar).

==Adverse effects==
The most widely reported side effect of glycyrrhizin use via consumption of black liquorice is reduction of blood potassium levels, which can affect body fluid balance and function of nerves. Chronic consumption of black licorice, even in moderate amounts, is associated with an increase in blood pressure, may cause irregular heart rhythm, and may have adverse interactions with prescription drugs. In extreme cases, death can occur as a result of excess consumption.

<doc id="346953" wikidata="Q510468" url="?curid=346953" title="Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 182">
<text>Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 182 was a scheduled flight on September 25, 1978, by Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), from Sacramento to San Diego (SAN), with a stopover at Los Angeles (LAX). The aircraft serving the flight, a Boeing 727-214 (registration: N533PS), collided mid-air with a private Cessna 172 (light aircraft; N7711G) over San Diego. It was Pacific Southwest Airlines&#x27; first fatal accident, and it remains the deadliest air disaster in California history. At the time, it was the deadliest air crash to occur in the United States, and remained so until the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 in May 1979.

Following their collision, both the Boeing and the Cessna crashed into North Park, a residential but urban uptown neighborhood located roughly three miles northeast of downtown San Diego. PSA 182 crashed just north of the intersection of Dwight and Nile Streets, killing all 135 people aboard the aircraft as well as seven bystanders on the ground or residents in their homes, including two children. The Cessna struck Polk Avenue, between 32nd and Iowa Streets, killing the two pilots on board. Nine others on the ground were injured, and a total of 22 residences were destroyed or damaged by the impact and debris.

==Prelude==

The crash of Flight 182 was preceded by a near-tragedy almost ten years earlier (also involving Pacific Southwest Airlines), when, on January 15, 1969, a PSA Boeing 727-214 (#N973PS) had collided with Cessna 182L (#N42242) on ascent from San Francisco International Airport, bound for Ontario International Airport. The 727 continued on to Ontario and landed safely, while the Cessna suffered damage on the right wing and returned to San Francisco.

==Accident==
On the morning of September 25, 1978, Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 182 departed Sacramento for San Diego via Los Angeles. The seven-person, San Diego–based crew consisted of Captain James E. &quot;Jim&quot; McFeron (42); First Officer Robert E. &quot;Bob&quot; Fox (38); Flight Engineer Martin J. Wahne (44); and four flight attendants. Captain McFeron, a veteran pilot with PSA, had accumulated a total of 14,382 flight hours, including 10,482 hours on the 727. First Officer Fox had a total of 10,049 flight hours, including 5,800 hours on the 727. Flight Engineer Wahne had a total of 10,800 flying hours, with 6,587 hours in the 727. The flight from Sacramento to Los Angeles was uneventful; at 8:34 am PDT, Flight 182 departed Los Angeles, with First Officer Fox as the pilot flying. There were 128 passengers on board, including 29 PSA employees; the weather in San Diego that Monday morning was sunny and clear with of visibility.

At 8:59 am, the PSA crew was alerted by the approach controller about a small Cessna 172 aircraft nearby. The Cessna was being flown by two licensed pilots. One was Martin Kazy Jr., 32, who possessed single-engine, multi-engine, and instrument flight ratings, as well as a commercial certificate and an instrument flight instructor certificate. He had flown a total of 5,137 hours. The other, David Boswell, 35, a U.S. Marine Corps sergeant, possessed single-engine and multi-engine ratings and a commercial certificate. He had flown 407 hours at the time of the accident, and was practicing instrument landing system approaches under the instruction of Kazy in pursuit of his instrument rating. They had departed from Montgomery Field and were navigating under visual flight rules, which did not require the filing of a flight plan. Boswell was wearing a &quot;hood&quot; to limit his field of vision straight ahead to the cockpit panel, much like an oversized sun visor with vertical panels to block peripheral vision, which is normal in IFR training. At the time of the collision, the Cessna was on the missed approach (in visual meteorological conditions) from San Diego airport&#x27;s (also known as Lindbergh Field) Runway 9, heading east and climbing. The Cessna was in communication with San Diego approach control.

The PSA pilots reported that they saw the Cessna after being notified of its position by ATC, although cockpit voice recordings revealed that shortly thereafter, the PSA pilots no longer had the Cessna in sight and they were speculating about its position. Due to radio static, Lindbergh tower (as per the tower voice recording) received the 09.00:50 transmission as &quot;He&#x27;s pass&quot;ing&quot; off to our right&quot; and assumed the PSA jet had the Cessna in sight, thus maintaining visual separation.

After getting permission to land, and about 40 seconds before colliding with the Cessna, the conversation among the four occupants of the cockpit (captain, first officer, flight engineer, and the off-duty PSA captain, Spencer Nelson, who was riding in the cockpit&#x27;s jump seat) was, as follows, showing the confusion:

Despite the captain&#x27;s comment that the Cessna was &quot;probably behind us now,&quot; it was actually directly in front of and below the Boeing. The PSA plane was descending and rapidly closing in on the small plane, which had taken a right turn to the east, deviating from the assigned course. According to the report issued by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Cessna may have been a difficult visual target for the jet&#x27;s pilots, as it was below them and blended in with the multicolored houses of the residential area beneath; the Cessna&#x27;s fuselage was yellow, and most of the houses were a yellowish color. Also, the apparent motion of the Cessna as viewed from the Boeing was minimized, as the planes were on approximately the same course. The report said that another possible reason that the PSA aircrew had difficulty observing the Cessna was that its fuselage was made visually smaller due to foreshortening. However, the same report in another section also stated, &quot;the white surface of the Cessna&#x27;s wing could have presented a relatively bright target in the morning sunlight.&quot;

A visibility study cited in the NTSB report concluded that the Cessna should have been almost centered in the windshield of the Boeing from 170 to 90 seconds before the collision, and thereafter it was probably positioned on the lower portion of the windshield just above the windshield wipers. The study also said that the Cessna pilot would have had about a 10-second view of the Boeing from the left-door window about 90 seconds before the collision, but visibility of the overtaking jet was blocked by the Cessna&#x27;s ceiling structure for the remainder of the time.

Flight 182&#x27;s crew never explicitly alerted the tower that they had lost sight of the Cessna; if they had made this clear to controllers, the crash might not have happened. Also, if the Cessna had maintained the heading of 70° assigned to it by ATC instead of turning to 90°, the NTSB estimates the planes would have missed each other by about instead of colliding. Ultimately, the NTSB maintained that, regardless of that change in course, it was the responsibility of the crew in the overtaking jet to comply with the regulatory requirement to pass &quot;well clear&quot; of the Cessna.

Approach control on the ground picked up an automated conflict alert 19 seconds before the collision, but did not relay this information to the aircraft because, according to the approach coordinator, such alerts were commonplace even when no actual conflict existed. The NTSB stated: &quot;Based on all information available to him, he decided that the crew of Flight 182 were complying with their visual separation clearance; that they were accomplishing an overtake maneuver within the separation parameters of the conflict alert computer; and that, therefore, no conflict existed.&quot;

This was the conversation in the PSA cockpit starting 16 seconds before collision with the Cessna:


PSA Flight 182 overtook the Cessna, which was directly below it, both roughly on a 090 (due east) heading. The collision occurred at about . According to several witnesses on the ground, first, they heard a loud metallic &quot;crunching&quot; sound, then an explosion, and a fire drew them to look up.

Staff photographer Hans Wendt of the San Diego County Public Relations Office was attending an outdoor press event with a still camera and took two post-collision photographs of the falling 727, its right wing burning. Cameraman Steve Howell from local TV channel 39 was attending the same event and captured the Cessna on film as it fell toward Earth, the sound of the impacting 727, and the mushroom cloud from the resulting crash. For its coverage of the disaster, &quot;The San Diego Evening Tribune&quot;, a predecessor to &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for &quot;Local, General, or Spot News Reporting&quot;.

The wreckage of the Cessna plummeted to the ground, its vertical stabilizer torn from its fuselage and bent leftward, its debris hitting around northwest of where the 727 went down. PSA 182&#x27;s right wing was heavily damaged, rendering the plane uncontrollable and sending it careening into a sharp right bank (seen in the Wendt photos), and the fuel tank inside it ruptured and started a fire, when this final conversation took place inside the cockpit:


Flight 182 struck a house at 3611 Nile Street, northeast of Lindbergh Field, in a residential section of San Diego known as North Park. It then impacted the driveway of the house at a , nose-down attitude while banked 50° to the right. Seismographic readings indicated that the impact occurred at 09:02:07, about 2.5 seconds after the cockpit voice recorder lost power. The plane crashed just west of the I-805 freeway, around north of the intersection of Dwight and Nile Streets, with the bulk of the debris field spreading in a northeast to southwesterly direction toward Boundary Street. One of the plane&#x27;s wings lodged in a house. The largest piece of the Cessna impacted about six blocks away near 32nd Street and Polk Avenue .

The explosion and fire from the 727 crash created a mushroom cloud that could be seen for miles (and was photographed and filmed). About 60% of the entire San Diego Fire Department was ultimately dispatched to the scene. The severity of the crash meant the engines, tail section, and landing gear were among the few recognizable parts remaining of the destroyed 727. However, the impact and debris area was relatively small due to the plane&#x27;s steep, nose-down angle.

In total, 144 people died in the crash, including Flight 182&#x27;s seven crew members, 30 additional PSA employees deadheading to PSA&#x27;s San Diego base, the two Cessna occupants, and seven residents (five women, two boys) on the ground. With 144 deaths, it was the deadliest accident to occur in the United States, surpassing the 1960 New York mid-air collision&#x27;s 134 fatalities, until eight months later when American Airlines Flight 191 crashed with 273 deaths. As of 2021, it is the sixth-deadliest aviation disaster in the United States (not including terrorism), as well as the deadliest aviation disaster in California.

==Investigation==
At the nearby St. Augustine High School, a triage and command and control center was established, with its gymnasium being used as a makeshift morgue and for forensic investigation. Freezer units were used to preserve the biological remains, as San Diego was in the middle of a severe heat wave, with temperatures exceeding .

National Transportation Safety Board report number NTSB/AAR-79-05, released April 19, 1979, determined that the probable cause of the accident was the failure of the PSA flight crew to follow proper air traffic control (ATC) procedures. Flight 182&#x27;s crew lost sight of the Cessna in contravention of ATC instructions to &quot;keep visual separation from that traffic&quot;, and did not alert ATC that they had lost sight of it. Errors on the part of ATC were also named as contributing factors, including the use of visual separation procedures when radar clearances were available. Additionally, the Cessna pilots, for reasons unknown, did not maintain their assigned east-northeasterly heading of 070° after completing a practice instrument approach, nor did they notify ATC of their course change. Concerning this, the NTSB report states, &quot;According to the testimony of the controllers and the assistant chief flight instructor of the Gibbs Flite Center (owner of the Cessna), the 08:59:56 transmission from approach control to the Cessna only imposed an altitude limitation on the pilot, he was not required to maintain the 070° heading. However, the assistant chief flight instructor testified that he would expect the [Cessna] pilot to fly the assigned heading or inform the controller that he was not able to do so.&quot;

A dissenting opinion in the original NTSB crash report by member Francis H. McAdams strongly questioned why the unauthorized change in course by the Cessna was not specifically cited as a &quot;contributing factor&quot; in the final report; instead, it was listed as simply a &quot;finding&quot;, which carries less weight. McAdams also &quot;sharply disagreed&quot; with the majority of the panel on other issues, giving more weight to inadequate ATC procedures as another &quot;probable cause&quot; to the accident, rather than merely treating them as a contributing factor. McAdams also added the &quot;possible misidentification of the Cessna by the PSA aircrew due to the presence of a third unknown aircraft in the area&quot; as a contributing factor. The majority panel members did not cite this as a credible possibility. In an August 1982 amendment to the probable-cause finding, the NTSB adopted McAdams&#x27; viewpoints regarding both ATC and pilot failings.

The report states that in the PSA cockpit, some conversation in the cockpit was not relevant to the flight during critical phases of the flight. The report states that the conversation was not a causal factor in the accident, but that &quot;it does point out the dangers inherent in this type of cockpit environment during descent and approach to landing.&quot;

The two photographs of Flight 182 taken by Hans Wendt revealed that the left wing flaps were extended as the crew tried to steer the crippled aircraft and that the right wing had a large piece missing where the Cessna had struck. Although it was obvious that the flaps were damaged or destroyed by the collision, NTSB investigators could not determine the condition of the hydraulic system in the wing and whether the plumbing inside it had actually been ruptured or merely flattened. Since the right wing was extremely fragmented, examination of debris provided no useful information. The crew may have tried to guide the 727 away from impacting a residential area and onto Route 805 where damage would be lessened, but could not do so. The final conclusion of the NTSB was that even if the hydraulic lines in the right wing were undamaged, the missing flaps and spreading fire would have adversely affected the plane&#x27;s aerodynamic profile, and in all likelihood Flight 182 was completely uncontrollable after the collision.

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of the devastation on the ground, a controversy was renewed in San Diego over the placement of such a busy airport in a heavily populated area. Despite proposals to relocate it, San Diego International Airport, the busiest single-runway commercial airport in the U.S., remains in use at the same site. The crash site was cordoned off by police and remained so for an entire year.

At the time, PSA Flight 182 was the U.S.&#x27;s deadliest commercial air disaster, surpassed eight months later on Friday, May 25, 1979, when American Airlines Flight 191 (a McDonnell Douglas DC-10) crashed in Chicago.

As a result of the crash, the NTSB recommended the immediate implementation of a Terminal Radar Service Area around Lindbergh Field to provide for the separation of aircraft, as well as an immediate review of control procedures for all busy terminal areas. This initial rule did not include small, general-aviation aircraft. Therefore, on May 15, 1980, the Federal Aviation Administration, implemented what is called Class B airspace to provide for the separation of all aircraft operating in the area. Additionally, all aircraft, regardless of size, are required to operate under &quot;positive radar control&quot;, a rule that allows only radar control from the ground for all aircraft operating in the airport&#x27;s airspace.

At the time of the crash, Lindbergh Field was the only airport in San Diego County with an instrument landing system. Since the Cessna pilot was practicing instrument landings, the FAA quickly installed the system at Montgomery Field and McClellan-Palomar Airport, as well as a localizer approach to Gillespie Field, to allow pilots to practice at smaller airports.

As a result of this and other midair collisions (including an almost identical one in 1986) the &quot;Traffic Collision Alert and Avoidance System&quot; (TCAS) is now installed in all commercial passenger aircraft and in most commercial cargo airplanes. TCAS gives the pilots visual and audible warnings in the cockpit when two aircraft are approaching each other, and directs pilots to either climb or descend to avoid the other aircraft. However, the system works only if at least one aircraft is equipped with TCAS and the other with a transponder. After the 1986 Cerritos collision, all flights in Class B were required to have a Mode C transponder. The International Civil Aviation Organization does not require TCAS on the type of small, single-engined planes that were involved in the PSA disaster or the one involving AeroMexico. Only aircraft certified to carry 19 or more passengers or have a maximum takeoff weight of more than are affected by the TCAS rule.

Because the PSA 182/Cessna collision was the result of pilot error, it is used as a teaching aid in modern flight training. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University uses the crash in &quot;human factors&quot; classes, while others refer to it when teaching airspace or visual separation rules.

Don St. Germain, who was an employee with PSA, was working aboard this flight when he died with the other 143 passengers and crew. Nine years later, his brother-in-law Douglas Arthur, who was a PSA pilot, was killed aboard PSA Flight 1771 near Cayucos, California, along with 42 other passengers and crew by a recently fired employee named David Augustus Burke. Burke shot his former boss, a flight attendant, the two pilots, and Arthur before he sent the plane into a nosedive, causing the aircraft to crash at the speed of sound. As such, Nikki St. Germain lost her brother in the first deadly crash of a PSA flight, and her husband in the second. Those were the only two deadly crashes in the 40-year history of the airline.

==Memorials==
A memorial plaque honoring those who died on both planes and on the ground is located in the San Diego Aerospace Museum, near the Theodore Gildred Flight Rotunda in San Diego&#x27;s Balboa Park. On the 20th anniversary of the crash, a tree was planted next to the North Park branch library, and a memorial plaque was dedicated to those who lost their lives. The library is not in the immediate vicinity of the actual crash site; it has been rebuilt and bears no visible evidence of the crash.

Informal memorial gatherings are held annually on the anniversary of the crash, at the intersection of Dwight and Nile Streets in North Park. On September 25, 2008, over 100 relatives and friends of the victims of PSA 182 gathered on the 30th-anniversary of the crash.

==Depictions in media==
The ATC recording of the accident, as well as graphic footage of the aftermath, was included in the mondo film &quot;Faces of Death&quot;, released two months after the crash.

The accident was covered in season 11 of the documentary TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Blind Spot&quot;. The episode featured interviews from witnesses and accident investigators and recreations of the crash. This episode aired on the Smithsonian Channel as &quot;Air Disasters&quot; season three, episode one.

The accident was covered in MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot; in the episode &quot;Collision Course&quot;, first aired April 27, 2013.

Years later, Whoopi Goldberg, who had witnessed the collision, referenced it as to why she stopped traveling by air.

<text>East Week (, Jyutping: dung1 zau1 hon1) is a Hong Kong–based weekly Chinese language magazine which was established by Oriental Press Group (the publisher of &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot;) on 29 October 1992 and sold to the Emperor Group in September 2001. It is now owned by Sing Tao News Corporation (former name: Global China Group Holdings), and published by China Touch Media Solutions &amp; Services Limited.

==Development==

=== Establishment and competition ===
Upon its establishment, &quot;East Week&quot; was positioned as a direct competitor to Next Magazine, published by Next Media Limited. Despite its efforts, &quot;East Week&quot; struggled to surpass &quot;Next Magazine&quot;, which consistently remained the top-selling magazine in Hong Kong with approximately 150,000 copies sold per issue. As a result, in September 2001, Ma Ching Fat, the Chairman of Oriental Press Group, decided to sell &quot;East Week&quot; to Emperor Group, owned by Albert Yeung.

=== Changes under Emperor Group ===
Following the acquisition by Albert Yeung, &quot;East Week&quot; underwent significant changes. The magazine shifted its focus, adopting sensational and controversial topics to attract readers. &quot;East Week&quot; began reporting on provocative stories such as the sex life of businessman Law Siu Fai and the extramarital affairs of banker David Li Kwok-po. These stories quickly became viral, generating widespread public awareness and interest.

=== Controversies and public response ===
&quot;East Week&quot;″s sensational reporting methods sparked considerable controversy. Law Siu Fai claimed he was being defamed by &quot;East Week&quot;″s reporting. A story involving an interview with Donald Tsang, former Chief Secretary of Hong Kong, drew public discontent. The article revealed details of Tsang&#x27;s private life without his consent. In response to the backlash, &quot;East Week&quot; issued a public apology to Tsang and compensated him with $120,000 Hong Kong dollars to avoid legal action.

Another major incident occurred on 29 October 2002, the day of the publication&#x27;s 10th anniversary, when the issue published a nude photo of actress Carina Lau. It was believed to have been taken forcibly when she was abducted 12 years ago. The issue was sold out that same afternoon, and its secondhand price hiked to $50–100 with none left in stock.

=== Public outrage and protests ===
The lack of media ethics demonstrated by &quot;East Week&quot; outraged the Hong Kong public, as well as entertainment professionals, women&#x27;s rights groups, and government officials. Massive protests broke out in the days following the Carina Lau scandal, condemning the magazine&#x27;s immorality. Actor Jackie Chan criticized the Hong Kong press as immoral, labeling it as primarily composed of paparazzi focused on prying into the private lives of celebrities and uncovering scandals for profit. Carina Lau was commended for her bravery in speaking publicly at the rallies.

=== Temporary shutdown ===
Under immense pressure, Albert Yeung was forced to shut down &quot;East Week&quot; on 1 November 2002. The scandal led to the temporary suspension of the magazine&#x27;s 10-year-long publication. Despite &quot;East Week&quot;″s apology for its actions, the controversy surrounding &quot;freedom of the press&quot; persisted. The Hong Kong police initiated a criminal investigation, resulting in the arrests of several employees involved in the scandal.

=== Revival and new ownership ===
On 3 September 2003, &quot;East Week&quot; re-entered the market with a renewed image, aiming to become a significant rival to other entertainment magazines. The publication&#x27;s ownership transitioned from Albert Yeung&#x27;s Emperor Group to Charles Ho Tsu Kwok&#x27;s Global China Group Holdings Limited, which also owns several local newspapers, such as &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong Standard&quot;. Ho Kwok Fai, CEO of China Touch, announced that Lai Ting Yiu, the Executive Chief Editor of Sing Tao News Corporation, had been appointed as the Editor-in-Chief of &quot;East Week&quot; to oversee overall operations and editorial matters.

=== Business potential and investment ===
The acquisition of &quot;East Week&quot; was motivated by its strong business potential, having established a wide readership base and advertiser support over the past decade. Ho Kwok Fai estimated the investment in &quot;East Week&quot; to be around 40 to 50 million Hong Kong dollars. He revealed that any financial losses from the first four issues would be covered by a well-known supermarket chain, whose name remained undisclosed. He anticipated that the publication would start generating profit within 1.5 to 2 years.

=== Editorial changes ===
Alongside changes in ownership, &quot;East Week&quot; also shifted its editorial positioning. The magazine adopted a more balanced and objective approach, aiming to provide content-driven coverage of celebrity news. Its new mission was to reveal the truth and address concerns relevant to all Hong Kong residents. Ho Tsu Kwok stated that &quot;East Week&quot;″s entry into the China market would depend on mainland government regulations and laws.

=== First issue after revival ===
The first issue of the revived &quot;East Week&quot;, released on 3 September 2003, featured a new design and layout. The cover story included an interview with Carina Lau discussing her new movie, &quot;Infernal Affairs II&quot;, and a feature on singer Anita Mui seeking treatment for cancer from a renowned oncologist.

<text>Bacoor (), officially the City of Bacoor (), is a component city in the province of Cavite, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 664,625 people, making it the 15th most populous city in the Philippines and the second largest city in the province of Cavite after Dasmariñas.

==Etymology==
The name of Bacoor is transcribed in old sources variously as &quot;Bacoor&quot;, &quot;Bacor&quot;, &quot;Bakur&quot;, etc. It was originally the name of the Bacoor Bay which separates the Cavite peninsula from the mainland. The name is believed to be originally from the Philippine Negrito languages, meaning &quot;circle&quot;, referring to the shape of the bay.

Another possible origin of the name of Bacoor is from Tagalog for &quot;highlands&quot; or &quot;plateau&quot; (cf. Bacolor and Bacolod).

==History==
===Spanish colonization era===

Bacoor was one of the flashpoints of the Cavite Mutiny of 1872. Bacoor&#x27;s parish priest at that time, Fr. Mariano Gómez, was one of the GOMBURZA trio implicated in the mutiny for advocating the secularization of priesthood in the Philippines. He and the rest of GOMBURZA were executed at Bagumbayan in 1872. The death of the GOMBURZA served as the inspiration for Jose Rizal&#x27;s &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot;, which in turn influenced the ignition of the Philippine Revolution.
During the Philippine Revolution against Spain in 1896, Bacoor was one of the first towns in Cavite to rise up. A Katipunan chapter, codenamed &quot;Gargano&quot;, led by Gil Ignacio from barrio Banalo, started the hostilities in Bacoor on September 2, 1896, three days after the revolution began.

On February 17, 1897, General Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s 40,000-strong force confronted a 20,000-strong Spanish reinforcement at the Zapote River. The Katipuneros reinforced the southern bank of the river with trenches designed by Filipino engineer Edilberto Evangelista.

Edilberto Evangelista was known as the &quot;Engineer of the revolution&quot; and the &quot;Hero of the revolution&quot;. They also blew up the Zapote Bridge with explosives which killed several Spaniards crossing it and thereby preventing them from reaching Cavite and forcing them to retreat to Muntinlupa. Despite the Filipino victory, they lost the brilliant Evangelista who was killed in action.

However, after the Spanish counteroffensive in May 1897, Bacoor and the rest of Cavite finally fell to the Spaniards, forcing Aguinaldo and his men to retreat to Biak-na-Bato.

===American invasion era===
With the Philippine declaration of independence from Spain on June 12, 1898, hostilities reignited in Cavite and Bacoor was designated as the first capital of Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s revolutionary government until it was transferred to Malolos, Bulacan in August 1898, a month before the convening of the Malolos Congress.

The Zapote Bridge became the site once again of another battle on June 13, 1899, this time between Philippine and American troops. An American force of 1,200 men supported by naval gunfire from the American squadron in Manila Bay crushed a 5,000-strong Filipino force led by General Pío del Pilar. Zapote Bridge&#x27;s special place in Philippine history is depicted today in Bacoor&#x27;s city seal.

On October 15, 1903, the Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 947, merging Bacoor and Perez-Dasmariñas with Imus. Bacoor was reconstituted as an independent municipality on October 24, 1906 by virtue of Act No. 1551, thus separating it from Imus.

===Japanese occupation era===
During World War II, in 1942, Japanese occupation forces entered Bacoor and other towns of Cavite province. From May 7, 1942, to August 15, 1945, many Caviteños joined the Cavite Guerrilla Unit (CGU), a recognized guerrilla group headed by Colonel Mariano Castañeda.

This group would eventually become the Filipino-American Cavite Guerrilla Forces (FACGF). Colonel Francisco Guerrero and the FACGF&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Regiment was put in charge of Japanese resistance in Bacoor.

The FAGCF, together with Filipino soldiers under the 4th, and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army liberated and recaptured Bacoor and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was defeated the Japanese Imperial Army forces from January 1, to August 15, 1945, during the Allied liberation of the Philippines.

===Philippine independence===
In 1972, Bacoor became a center of commemoration for the centennial of the martyrdom of the Gomburza and its beloved parish priest Padre Mariano Gomes. The celebrations were headed by Mayor Pablo Gomez Sarino, a relative of Fr. Gomes, which included the turnover of a historical marker to the town of Bacoor.

On June 21, 1988, Mayor Angelito Miranda was assassinated in front of a hospital in Las Piñas by two gunmen, which the police claimed to be from a notorious drug syndicate.

===Cityhood===

During the 1990s and 2000s, Bacoor attempted to achieve cityhood status due to its growing population and tax income, with several cityhood bills filed in Congress in 1997, 2000 and 2007. On July 25, 2011, President Benigno Aquino III signed into law Republic Act No. 10160 creating the City of Bacoor. It was ratified through a plebiscite on June 23, 2012, wherein majority of the town&#x27;s participated registered voters favored the cityhood.

With the incorporation of Bacoor as a city, it was divided into two legislative districts, Bacoor West and Bacoor East. During the 2013 mid-term elections, the citizens of Bacoor voted for six councilors for each of the two districts.

On April 12, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law Republic Act No. 11274, amending Section 10(B) of RA No. 10160; as a result, eight barangays had their names P.F. Espiritu corrected to Panapaan, and another, Zapote V, which was inadvertently omitted in the list provided by an earlier law, was included as part of Bacoor West.

===2023 plebiscite===
On March 28, 2023, the city government passed &quot;City Ordinance No. 275-2023&quot;, signed by mayor Strike Revilla, pursuant to the &quot;Local Government Code of 1991&quot;. The said ordinance aimed to reduce 49 barangays to 23: 44 to be merged into 18; five others to be renamed as a consequence of the merger. As a result, the number of city&#x27;s barangays will be reduced from 73 to 47.

On May 17, the Commission on Elections issued &quot;Resolution No. 10917&quot; for the conduct of the plebiscite, which was set on July 29.

A plebiscite was held in 223 clustered precincts across 22 voting centers, as well as in the city jail, with more than a hundred thousand registered voters expected to participate. Despite low voter turnout, majority of voters agreed with the ordinance. The plebiscite results were announced after midnight of July 30.

Local officials had argued that once ratified, the merger of 44 barangays will increase their annual income by about 147–197%. COMELEC said that the city&#x27;s 223 clustered precincts will be decreased for the upcoming nationwide barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections in October.

==Geography==
===Physical===
Bacoor is strategically located at the gateway to Metro Manila. A sub-urban area, the city is located from Imus and southwest of Manila, on the southeastern shore of Manila Bay, at the northwest portion of the province with an area of 52.4 square kilometers.

It is bordered to the east by Las Piñas and Muntinlupa, to the south by Dasmariñas, to the west by Kawit and Imus, and to the north by Bacoor Bay, an inlet of Manila Bay. Bacoor is separated from Las Piñas by the Zapote River and Imus and Kawit by the Bacoor River.

Most of the city comprises flat, formerly agricultural lands, while some areas, such as the coastal barangays of Zapote, Talaba, Niog, and Panapaan, are below sea level. Some barangays, such as Molino and Queens Row, are situated on the hills that form valleys along the upstream portion of the Zapote River.

===Barangays===
Bacoor is politically subdivided into 73 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

These barangays are grouped into two local electoral districts, officially called Bacoor West and Bacoor East, represented in the city council by their respective councilors. However, the city government has officially abandoned such name designation for the electoral districts and has released edicts officially calling them District 1 and District 2, respectively.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification system, Bacoor features a tropical savanna climate that borders on a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification Aw/Am). Together with the rest of the Philippines, Bacoor lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the equator means that the temperature range is small, rarely going lower than and going higher than . However, humidity levels are usually very high, which makes it feel much warmer. It has a distinct dry season from late December through April and a relatively lengthy wet season that covers the remaining period. The southwest monsoon, or &quot;Habagat&quot;, occurs from June to September and can cause flooding in parts of the city.

==Demographics==

In the 2020 census, the population of Bacoor, was 664,625 people, with a density of . It is the second most populous city in the province after Dasmariñas.

The city is a bedroom community of Metro Manila which owes its large population to the influx of low and middle-income settlers who availed of the various housing projects and subdivisions in it.

===Religion===
Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion in Bacoor. It is part of the Diocese of Imus and is the seat of the Vicariate of St. Michael the Archangel and the Vicariate of Santo Niño de Molino. One of Bacoor&#x27;s notable parish priests was Fr. Mariano Gómez, one of the GOMBURZA trio implicated in the Cavite Mutiny who served as parish priest at the Bacoor parish church from 1824 to his death in 1872. Another notable priest who served the parish of Bacoor was St. Ezekiel Moreno at the time when it was still part of the vast hacienda of the Recollects. He tirelessly provided the Last Rites to the victims of a cholera plague which affected the towns of Bacoor and Imus and was responsible for the rehabilitation of the Molino Dam to irrigate the rice fields of Bacoor and Las Piñas.

Due to the Philippine Revolution, Bacoor was once again ministered to by secular Filipino priests under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila. However, during the American occupation in 1902, the Catholic parish priest at that time, Fr. Fortunato Clemeña, became the first Aglipayan priest of Bacoor, as well as the first Aglipayan Bishop of Cavite, during the Aglipayan Schism. Most of the first members of the church in Bacoor were Katipuneros headed by General Mariano Noriel, who is also the first president of the laymen organization. The conversion of Father Clemeña eventually led to the occupation of the old parish church of Bacoor by the Philippine Independent Church, whose occupation ended in 1907 by order of the Philippine Supreme Court ruling in favor of the Catholic Church for illegally-occupied church property. After this recovery, the Roman Catholics exerted efforts in the early 20th century to revive its numbers in the town through the revitalization of its fiesta and the establishment of new traditions. Despite this, and the influx of largely non-Aglipayan migrants from Manila and from other provinces, the presence of the Aglipayan church is still evident in the city. The Aglipayan Diocese of Cavite&#x27;s Cathedral in Barangay Digman, which is also dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, is situated a few blocks away from the town&#x27;s Catholic church. It is the second dominant religion in Bacoor.

Bacoor also has a significant population of Muslims, mostly middle-class Maranao traders and merchants, with a minority of Badjao fishing communities. Several mosques cater to the local Muslim community of Bacoor, the largest being Masjid As-Salaamah, opposite Zapote market. A number of Protestant and other Christian denominations also have a presence in the city.

==Economy==


===Commerce===
Bacoor is currently experiencing a rapid shift from an agriculture-based economy to a residential/commercial urban center. Nowadays, retail, manufacturing, banking and service sectors are Bacoor&#x27;s primary income earners. Commercial activities are sporadic throughout the city ranging from wholesale to retail establishments, restaurants and eateries, hardware and construction supplies and other service-related industries, especially those located in SM City Bacoor where it serves as the city&#x27;s main income earner. The mostly residential area of Molino is also home to SM Center Molino at the corner of Molino Road and Daang Hari. The entrance area from the Coastal Road to Aguinaldo Highway in Talaba and the area surrounding the Zapote Public Market (now the Bacoor Public Market) are other commercial centers. Bacoor has branches of 11 different commercial banks all over the city.

Meanwhile, agricultural area has lessened to only 100 hectares while fishponds which likewise decreased to almost half of the original 760 hectares. Salt production, fishing, oyster and mussel culture, which are now being threatened to near extinction because of pollution and overpopulation, are the other sources of income of the residents. These industries are also threatened by the construction of the Cavite Coastal Road Extension which directly affected the Bacoor shoreline.

===Land use===
Land use developments in Bacoor include a proposed industrial village in Barangay Niog which will include light cottage industries with supporting residential and commercial facilities. A vast tract of land in Molino area, on the other hand, is envisioned to host residential, institutional and commercial facilities. Dubbed as the &quot;New Bacoor&quot;, the land use plan in Molino seeks to utilize the area not only as a dormitory for individuals who work in Metro Manila but also for people who have migrated to Bacoor in search of economic advancement. 

==Government==
===City seal===

The current seal of the City of Bacoor was adopted in 2012 after its conversion to city. It bears resemblance to the previous seal when Bacoor was still a municipality, but with additional symbols that reflect the city&#x27;s character and recent developments. It is composed of a circular ribbon with the phrases &quot;Lungsod ng Bacoor&quot; (City of Bacoor) and &quot;Lalawigan ng Cavite&quot; (Province of Cavite) on the top and bottom portion of the ribbon. The ribbon symbolizes the continuity of Bacoor&#x27;s time-honored traditions despite its conversion to a city. On the foreground is the Zapote Bridge, which was the site of two major battles during the Philippine Revolution against Spain and the Filipino-American War. The bridge features 73 bricks symbolizing the 73 barangays that make up to city. Written on the bridge is 1671, the year the city was founded.

Underneath the bridge is a body of water symbolizing Zapote River, which passes through the city. Floating over it is a mussel shell, a seafood cultivated in the city and symbolizes its two new districts, Bacoor West and Bacoor East. On top of the bridge is an 11-member marching band, symbolizing the 11 marching bands that are found in the city and a callback to its nickname as the country&#x27;s marching band capital. Serving as background to the bridge are (on the left) a bamboo tree, from which the city&#x27;s name was taken and describes the resilient nature of its people; and (on the right) buildings, which symbolizes the city&#x27;s progress. Between these two symbols is the Philippine sun with its eight rays, signifying the city&#x27;s role in the province during the revolution against Spain. Above the sun is 2012, the year Bacoor was converted into a city of Cavite. Behind these symbols are the colors of the Philippine flag: red, which symbolizes courage; white, symbolizing peace; and blue, which symbolizes the people of Bacoor&#x27;s calmness, serenity and commitment to protecting the environment, as well as of the waters of its rivers and Manila Bay.

===Elected officials===


Pursuant to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, the city government is to be composed of a mayor (&quot;alkalde&quot;), a vice mayor (&quot;bise alkalde&quot;) and members (&quot;kagawad&quot;) of the legislative branch Sangguniang Panlungsod alongside a secretary to the said legislature, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms.

As with every Philippine city, Bacoor&#x27;s chief executive is the city mayor. Elected to a term of three years and limited to three consecutive terms, the chief executive appoints the directors of each city department, which include the office of administration, engineering office, information office, legal office, and treasury office. The incumbent mayor of Bacoor is Lani Mercado-Revilla, from the Lakas Party, who first served as the city&#x27;s lone representative in the Philippine House of Representatives from 2010 to 2016. She is the wife or former Senator Ramon Revilla, Jr.

The city&#x27;s vice mayor performs duties as acting governor in the absence of the mayor. The vice mayor also automatically succeeds as mayor upon the death of the incumbent. The vice mayor also convenes the Sangguniang Panlungsod, the city&#x27;s legislative body. The incumbent vice mayor of Bacoor is Catherine Sarino-Evaristo from the Lakas Party. She first assumed office on June 30, 2013, after defeating former vice mayor Rosette Miranda-Fernando. She ran and was elected for a second term in 2016.

===Legislative===
The city, which is a lone congressional district, is represented in the Philippine House of Representatives by congressman Strike Revilla from the Lakas Party, brother-in-law of Mayor Lani Mercado-Revilla. He first assumed office as city mayor from 2007 to 2016. Within the city, the City Board or Sangguniang Panlungsod crafts all city ordinances, performs appropriation of city funds, issues franchises and permits, impose fees on city services, and exercise other duties and powers as stipulated by the Local Government Code of 1991. Being a first-class city in terms of income, Bacoor is entitled to a City Board composed of 12 members, six each from the city&#x27;s two board districts.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Bacoor is described as a bedroom community with most of its citizens commuting to and from Metro Manila to work. The city is the connected to Metro Manila by expressways like CAVITEX and Muntinlupa–Cavite Expressway, national roads like Aguinaldo Highway (N62/N419) and Quirino Avenue (N62) in the north, and other major thoroughfares like Daang Hari and Marcos Alvarez Avenue. It is also the terminus of the Aguinaldo Highway and Tirona Highway which connects the city to the rest of Cavite. Common forms of transportation are buses, mini-buses, public utility vans, jeepneys.

Due to the congestion of Bacoor&#x27;s major thoroughfares and overpopulation, the city suffers from daily heavy traffic. This is expected to be eased in the future with the construction of the Manila Light Rail Transit System&#x27;s southern terminus in the city. The LRT 1 South Extension project would see the LRT-1 extended from Baclaran in Pasay to Niog in Bacoor. The project&#x27;s estimated cost is P65 billion.

On September 12, 2014, the Benigno Aquino III administration awarded the contract for the construction of the LRT 1 South Extension project to the Light Rail Manila Consortium, which is composed of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation, AC Infrastructure Holdings Corp. (a subsidiary of Ayala Corporation), Sumitomo Corporation, and Macquarie Infrastructure Holdings (Philippines) Pte. Ltd.

The groundbreaking for the LRT Line 1 South Extension Project was held on Thursday, May 4, 2017, with the actual construction officially commencing on Tuesday, May 7, 2019, after the right-of-way became &quot;free and clear&quot; from obstructions.

, phase 1 is 98.2% complete. Department of Transportation Executive Assistant Jonathan Gesmundo announced the construction of 8 additional stations to the current 20 LRT-1 stations with operations of LRT-1 Cavite Extension Phase 1 are expected by mid-November 2024. Meanwhile, phases 2 and 3 will begin operations by 2031. Once fully operational, Bacoor will be served by the LRT-1 via the future Niog station.

Bacoor is also part of the proposed Cavite–Laguna Expressway (CALAX) which will be funded through debt financing. Metro Pacific Tollways Corp. (MPTC), which will undertake the construction of CALAX, has announced it will borrow P30 billion for the project. MPTC president Rodrigo Franco &quot;said the firm will partner with local banks for debt financing by earlier next year.&quot;

===Health===
To address the health concerns of the city&#x27;s ageing population and urban poor population, several public and private hospitals have been established in the city. The local government also initiated a discount program for senior citizens in city wherein they can avail of discounted medical care and medicines in hospitals in and outside of Bacoor.

Along with a number of small private clinics, Bacoor has one major public hospital and seven major private hospitals:

* Bacoor District Hospital
* Bacoor Doctors Medical Center
* Crisostomo General Hospital
* Metro South Medical Center]
* Molino Doctors Hospital
* Southeast Asian Medical Center
* St. Dominic Medical Center
* St. Michael Medical Hospital
===Public safety===
The Bacoor Traffic Management Department (BTMD) and the Bacoor Public Safety Unit are the main agencies tasked for maintaining peace and order in the city. The Bacoor Police Station, a component of the Cavite Police Provincial Office under the Philippine National Police, assists them in this regard. Given the status of the BTMD as the highest office in the local bureaucracy (with the status of a department), it has been entrusted by the city government to oversee ordinance implementation city-wide with the PNP playing second fiddle.

==Education==
As a bedroom community, Bacoor is home to public and private education institutions. There are 27 public elementary schools and seven public high schools throughout the city. Students in the public school sector study under the K–12 curriculum. There are numerous privately run elementary schools and high schools. Several private colleges offer academic as well as technical-vocational education.

The city is home to two universities: University of Perpetual Help System DALTA and two campuses of the Cavite State University.

<text>Bernard Edwards (October 31, 1952 – April 18, 1996) was an American musician, songwriter and record producer, known primarily for his work in disco music with guitarist Nile Rodgers, with whom he co-founded Chic. In 2017, Edwards was selected as the 53rd greatest bassist of all time by &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine.

==Biography==
Edwards was born in Greenville, North Carolina, and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, where he met Nile Rodgers in the early 1970s. At the time, Edwards was working at a post office with the mother of Rodgers&#x27;s girlfriend. The two formed the Big Apple Band (active 1972–1976) and then united with drummer Tony Thompson to eventually form Chic together with singer Norma Jean Wright.

With Chic (active 1976–1983), Edwards created era-defining hits such as &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;, &quot;Everybody Dance&quot;, &quot;Le Freak&quot;, &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; and &quot;Good Times&quot;. Edwards also worked with Nile Rodgers to produce and write for other artists, using Chic to perform everything musically and vocally except lead vocals. Those productions with Norma Jean Wright, Sister Sledge, Sheila and B. Devotion, Diana Ross, Johnny Mathis, Debbie Harry and Fonzi Thornton led to more hits such as &quot;Saturday&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s The Greatest Dancer&quot;, &quot;We Are Family&quot;, &quot;Spacer&quot;, &quot;Upside Down&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot; and &quot;Backfired&quot;. In the song &quot;We Are Family,&quot; Kathy Sledge gives Edwards a brief shout-out, singing &quot;Yeah, come on Bernard, play...play your funky bass, boy!&quot;. As a lone songwriter/producer, he gave Diana Ross her Top 15 hit, &quot;Telephone&quot; from her 1985 platinum &quot;Swept Away&quot; album released on RCA and Ross&#x27; international label, Capitol-EMI.

Edwards released a solo album, &quot;Glad to Be Here&quot; in 1983, and in 1985 he was instrumental in the formation of the supergroup the Power Station. The band&#x27;s first album was produced by Edwards and featured Chic drummer Tony Thompson, and Duran Duran members John and Andy Taylor as well as singer Robert Palmer. Edwards followed this by producing Robert Palmer&#x27;s hit album &quot;Riptide&quot;. He continued to produce artists throughout the 1980s and 90s, including Diana Ross, Adam Ant, Rod Stewart, Jody Watley, Grayson Hugh, Air Supply, ABC and Duran Duran.

Edwards was the father of multi-platinum record producer Bernard &quot;Focus...&quot; Edwards, Jr. who has produced songs for Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, Busta Rhymes, Bishop Lamont, Tony Yayo and more.

Edwards teamed up with Nile Rodgers again for the Chic reunion in the early 1990s and released the album &quot;Chic-Ism&quot; in 1992.

==Death==
In 1996, Edwards and Nile Rodgers were in Japan participating in &quot;J.T. Super Producers &#x27;96,&quot; a concert series sponsored by Japan Tobacco. Just before the concert at the Budokan Arena in Tokyo, Edwards fell ill, but despite Rodgers&#x27; insistence, refused to cancel the gig. He managed to perform but had to be helped at times. At one point, Edwards blacked out for a few seconds before resuming his playing. Rodgers assumed the absence of bass was a deliberate improvisation and did not learn the truth until after the show. After the concert, Rodgers went to check on Edwards and asked how he was doing, to which he replied &quot;I&#x27;m fine, I just need to rest.&quot; This was the last time Rodgers spoke to Edwards. Edwards retired to his hotel room where he was later found dead by Rodgers. The medical examiner determined the cause of death was pneumonia. Edwards&#x27;s final performance was issued in 1999 as the album &quot;Live at the Budokan&quot;.

==Influence==
His bass line from the Chic hit &quot;Good Times&quot; has become one of the most copied pieces of music in history, and had a huge influence on musicians of many genres when released and was the inspiration for &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; by Queen.

&quot;Good Times&quot; was credited on Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; in 1979 (the vinyl label reads &quot;based on the music from the song &#x27;Good Times&#x27; N. Rogers / B. Edwards&quot;) – the first rap song to become a mainstream hit. The following decades saw it sampled by artists of diverse genres, from rap to punk and techno to pop. Duran Duran bassist John Taylor often played the song in homage during his solo performances and cited Edwards as his primary influence.

Edwards was nominated for four Grammy Awards for his work with Chic, Sister Sledge, Diana Ross, and Robert Palmer.

On September 19, 2005, Edwards was honored posthumously for his outstanding achievement as a producer, when he was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame at a ceremony held in New York.

<doc id="346978" wikidata="Q2299598" url="?curid=346978" title="SuperCollider">
<text>SuperCollider is an environment and audio programming language released originally in 1996 by James McCartney for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

Since then it has been evolving into a system used and further developed by both scientists and artists working with sound. It is a dynamic programming language providing a framework for acoustic research, algorithmic music, interactive programming, and live coding.

Originally released under the terms of the GPL-2.0-or-later in 2002, and from version 3.4 under GPL-3.0-or-later, SuperCollider is free and open-source software.

==Architecture==
Starting with version 3, the SuperCollider environment has been split into two components: a server, &quot;scsynth&quot;; and a client, &quot;sclang&quot;. These components communicate using OSC (Open Sound Control).

The SC language combines the object-oriented structure of Smalltalk and features from functional programming languages with a C-family syntax.

The SC Server application supports simple C and C++ plugin APIs, making it easy to write efficient sound algorithms (unit generators), which can then be combined into graphs of calculations. Because all external control in the server happens via OSC, it is possible to use it with other languages or applications.

=== The SuperCollider synthesis server (&quot;scsynth&quot;) ===
SuperCollider&#x27;s sound generation is bundled into an optimised command-line executable (named &quot;scsynth&quot;). In most cases it is controlled from within the SuperCollider programming language, but it can be used independently. The audio server has the following features:

* Open Sound Control access
* Simple ANSI C and C++11 plugin APIs
* Supports any number of input and output channels, including massively multichannel setups
* Gives access to an ordered tree structure of synthesis nodes which define the order of execution
* Bus system which allows dynamically restructuring the signal flow
* Buffers for writing and reading
* Calculation at different rates depending on the needs: audio rate, control rate, demand rate

Supernova, an independent implementation of the Server architecture, adds multi-processor support through explicit parallel grouping of synthesis nodes.

=== The SuperCollider programming language (&quot;sclang&quot;) ===
The SuperCollider programming language is a dynamically typed, garbage-collected, single-inheritance object-oriented, and functional language similar to Smalltalk, with a syntax similar to the languages Lisp or C. Its architecture strikes a balance between the needs of real-time computing and the flexibility and simplicity of an abstract language. Like many functional languages, it implements functions as first-class objects, which may be composed. Functions and methods can have default argument values and variable length argument lists and can be called with any order of keyword arguments. Closures are lexical, and scope is both lexical and dynamic. Further features typical of functional languages are supported, including creating closures via partial application (explicit currying), tail call optimization, list comprehensions, and coroutines. Specifics include the implicit expansion of tuples and the stateless pattern system. Its constant-time message lookup and real-time garbage collection allows large systems to be efficient and to handle signal processing flexibly.

By supporting methods of reflective, conversational, and literate programming, SuperCollider makes it relatively easy to find new sound algorithms and to develop custom software and custom frameworks. Regarding domain specific knowledge, it is both general (e.g., it allows the representation of properties such as time and pitch in variable degrees of abstraction) and has copious example implementations for specific purposes.

===GUI system===

The SuperCollider language allows users to construct cross-platform graphical user interfaces for applications. The standard class library with user interface components may be extended by a number of available frameworks. For interactive programming, the system supports programmatic access to rich-text code files. It may be used to generate vector graphics algorithmically.

==Interfacing and system support==

===Clients===
Because the server is controlled using Open Sound Control (OSC), a variety of applications can be used to control the server. SuperCollider language environments (see below) are typically used, but other OSC-aware systems can be used such as Pure Data.

&quot;Third-party&quot; clients for the SuperCollider server exist, including rsc3, a Scheme client, hsc3, based on Haskell, ScalaCollider, based on Scala, Overtone, based on Clojure, and Sonic Pi. These are distinct from the development environments mentioned below because they do not provide an interface to SuperCollider&#x27;s programming language, instead they communicate directly with the audio server and provide their own approaches to facilitating user expression.

===Supported operating systems===

SuperCollider runs on macOS, Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD. For each of these operating systems there are multiple language-editing environments and clients that can be used with SuperCollider (see below).

It has also been demonstrated that SuperCollider can run on Android and iOS.

===Editing environments===

SuperCollider code is most commonly edited and used from within its own cross-platform IDE, which is Qt-based and supports Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Other development environments with SuperCollider support include:
* Emacs (Linux, Mac, Windows)
* Vim (Linux, Mac)
* Atom (Linux, Mac, Windows)
* gedit (Linux, Windows)
* Kate (Linux, Windows)

==Code examples==

// play a mixture of pink noise and a sine tone of 800 Hz 
{ SinOsc.ar(800, 0, 0.1) + PinkNoise.ar(0.01) }.play;

// modulate the frequency of the sine tone and the amplitude of the noise signal with another sine signal,
// the frequency of which depends on the horizontal position of the mouse pointer 
{
 var x = SinOsc.ar(MouseX.kr(1, 100));
 SinOsc.ar(300 * x + 800, 0, 0.1)
 PinkNoise.ar(0.1 * x + 0.1)
}.play;

// List iteration: multiply the elements of a collection by their indices
[1, 2, 5, 10, -3].collect { |elem, idx| elem * idx };

// Factorial function
f = { |x| if(x == 0) { 1 } { f.(x-1) * x } };

{
 var a, b, c, d, n, e, f, out;

 a = Impulse.ar(8)*1.5;

 b = WhiteNoise.ar * Env([1.0,1.0,0.0],[0.01,0.01],\step).ar(0, Impulse.ar(1 )) ;

 5.do{ c = (c.distort + c)*0.75};
 c = c * 1.5;

 d = LPF.ar(Saw.ar([20,47]).sum , XLine.ar(4000,200,0.5)) * Env.perc.ar(0, Impulse.ar(1/16)) * 0.5;
 d = (GVerb.ar( d , roomsize:10, revtime:6) * 200).clip(-1.0,1.0) * 0.3;

 n = 12;
 e = ( Saw.ar( 40*(1..n) * ({ LFNoise1.ar(0.1).range(1,1.01) } ! n) ) *
 ({ LFNoise1.ar(0.1).range(0.0,1.0) }!n)).sum * 10;
 e = CombC.ar(e, 0.1, 0.1, 4) + e;
 e = e.tanh * 0.3 * SinOsc.ar(0.05).range(0.5,1.0);
 e = e.dup;
 e = e * SinOsc.ar(0.03).range(0.2,1.0) * 0.5;

 f = Blip.ar(100) * Blip.ar(100) * Env([0.0,0.0,1.0],[8,8],[\step,\linear,\step])
 .ar(0, Impulse.ar(1/16)) * 2 ;

 out = ((a + b + c + f) ! 2) + d + e;
 out = out * 0.2

}.play


==Live coding==
As a versatile dynamic programming language, SuperCollider can be used for live coding, i.e. performances which involve the performer modifying and executing code on the fly. Specific kinds of proxies serve as high level placeholders for synthesis objects which can be swapped in and out or modified at runtime. Environments allow sharing and modification of objects and process declarations over networks. Various extension libraries support different abstraction and access to sound objects, e.g. dewdrop_lib allows for the live creation and modification of pseudo-classes and pseudo-objects.

<doc id="346979" wikidata="Q152832" url="?curid=346979" title="Kevin Keegan">
<text>Joseph Kevin Keegan (born 14 February 1951) is an English former footballer and manager. Nicknamed &quot;King Kev&quot; or &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot;, Keegan was recognised for his dribbling ability, as well as his finishing and presence in the air, and is regarded as one of the greatest players of his era. 

Keegan began his playing career at Scunthorpe United in 1968, before Bill Shankly signed him for Liverpool. There, he won three First Division titles, the UEFA Cup twice, the FA Cup and, in his final season, the European Cup. During this period, he was a regular member of the England national team, and captained the team on 31 occasions, including at UEFA Euro 1980. He moved to Hamburger SV in the summer of 1977 and was named European Footballer of the Year in both 1978 and 1979. Hamburg won the Bundesliga title in the 1978–79 season and reached the 1980 European Cup final. Keegan left Hamburg and played at Southampton for two seasons, before transferring to Newcastle United in the Second Division in 1982. He helped Newcastle secure promotion in his second season, and retired from playing in 1984. He scored 204 goals in 592 appearances in his club career, adding 21 goals in 63 caps for the England national team.

Keegan moved into management at Newcastle in 1992, and the team won promotion to the Premier League as First Division champions in his first full season, the following year. Newcastle finished second in the Premier League in the 1995–96 season, despite leading the way for most of the campaign. After managing Fulham for two seasons, he took charge of the England national team in February 1999. However, he resigned in October 2000, following a 1–0 loss against Germany in qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In 2001, he became manager of Manchester City for four years, until he resigned in 2005. Keegan had been out of football for almost three years when he returned to Newcastle for a second spell as manager in January 2008. However, this lasted only eight months, as he resigned in September, following speculation about a dispute with the club&#x27;s directors. He has the unique distinction of being promoted as champions in his first full season with the three clubs he managed.

==Early years==

Keegan&#x27;s paternal ancestors arrived in Newcastle from Ireland. In 1909, his grandfather Frank, an inspector, heroically saved lives in the West Stanley Pit disaster. His father Joe and uncle Frank were Newcastle United supporters, describing their favourite players as Hughie Gallacher and Jackie Milburn. His father moved to Armthorpe in Doncaster (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire) to work in a colliery, where he married Doris and they had three children: Mary, who was two years Keegan&#x27;s senior, Kevin, and Michael. His father never saw Keegan play for Newcastle.

Keegan was born in February 1951 at his aunt Nellie&#x27;s house in Elm Place in Armthorpe, as she had electricity that made it safer for childbirth. Keegan attended St. Peter&#x27;s High School in nearby Cantley.

Keegan was given his first football by his uncle Frank and his first pair of football boots by his father after he won betting on horses. They were a second-hand pair of Winit boots bought from a sports shop run by former Doncaster Rovers centre forward Ray Harrison. Keegan played football at Hyde Park using his baby brother Michael&#x27;s pushchair as a goal post. As a boy, he supported Doncaster Rovers. His favourite player was Alick Jeffrey, a player once described by Matt Busby&#x27;s assistant, Jimmy Murphy, as the English Pelé, and once described by Milburn as &quot;the best young player he had ever seen&quot;. As a schoolboy, Keegan had a trial for Coventry City under manager Jimmy Hill. Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract. They did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back Brian Joy, who went on to have a 15-year career in football. Keegan had another trial with Doncaster Rovers arranged by his father, but when Keegan arrived he found out he had the wrong information—the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place.

Keegan participated in various sports, such as cross country running, rugby, and football, and served his school&#x27;s cricket team as captain. He also boxed at his local club, run by the former British Heavyweight champion Bruce Woodcock. At age 15, Keegan and two friends completed a 50-mile run from Nottingham to Doncaster. In his autobiography, Keegan claimed this run prepared him physically and psychologically for any running he had to do in future pre-season training or football matches. Keegan left school with O Levels in History and Art.

At the age of 15, Keegan started working at Pegler Brass Works as an office clerk, though he has said he was more of a tea boy and messenger than a clerk. Whilst working at Pegler, Keegan played Saturday afternoon football for his local youth club, Enfield House, and Sunday morning football for the Lonsdale Hotel. It was during this time that a colleague named Harry Holland invited him to play for the Peglers Works reserves. His chance at professional football came when he was playing Sunday morning league football for the Lonsdale Hotel in a match against Woodfield Social in 1966. Keegan was marked by an older player named Bob Nellis, who was so impressed by the ability of Keegan that he offered him a trial at Fourth Division side Scunthorpe United — one of just two professional sides in the division. This trial would lead to the Scunthorpe manager Ron Ashman giving Keegan his first contract in professional football.

==Club career==
===1966–1971: Scunthorpe United===
Scunthorpe United could not afford a set of football nets and trained on a rugby pitch at Quibell Park. They also had five-a-side training sessions on the Old Show Ground concrete car park. Keegan took training very seriously, twice a week training with teammate Derek Hemstead by doing weighted farmers walks up and down the cantilever stand at the Old Show Ground. In running drills at Scunthorpe, Keegan liked trying to finish first and was told by coach Jack Brownsword that one thing he had going for him was that he was a &quot;one-hundred percenter&quot; and he should never lose that. This will to be first in his running drills would later irritate senior professionals such as Liverpool&#x27;s Tommy Smith, and Bill Shankly would later advise Keegan that he did not have to win all his runs.

Scunthorpe did not have the funds for a full-time driver to drive them to away games, so Keegan and the other younger players would take turns in driving the minibus to and from away games. Keegan, Nigel Jackson, Jimmy Coyne, Alan Olbison and Steve Hibbotson once borrowed Brownsword&#x27;s stopwatch and had timed rallies around the Old Show Ground with the club&#x27;s vintage tractor. On Keegan&#x27;s turn, the tractor crashed and the tractor&#x27;s axle went through the engine. The crash was very expensive to fix and the five players were harshly reprimanded by manager Ron Ashman. This experience gave Keegan awareness of his responsibility as a representative of Scunthorpe United. In 1968, Keegan made his debut against Peterborough United at the age of 17, and went on to make 29 league starts in his first season. He became a regular in the first team by the 1969–70 season, playing all 46 league games for the club. That season saw the team reach the fifth round of the FA Cup, beating First Division side Sheffield Wednesday along the way. His low wages at Scunthorpe meant Keegan had to find summer jobs, such as plate-laying at the Appleby Frodingham Steelworks.

 Keegan played regularly in a creative right midfield role for the Scunthorpe first team, scoring 18 goals in 124 games for the club. After his first season, he started attracting interest from higher division clubs. In a rare televised interview at Scunthorpe during the 1969–70 season, Keegan tried to play down the interest, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m getting first-team football here. Should think if I went First Division, I&#x27;d struggle a bit.&quot; Not long after this interview, Keegan began to feel impatient about playing in higher divisions and even considered quitting the game and getting a full-time job. Higher division clubs such as Preston North End, Birmingham City, Notts County, Millwall and Arsenal all showed interest in Keegan but nothing came of it.

===1971–1977: Liverpool===

In 1971, Keegan attracted the attention of Liverpool&#x27;s head scout Geoff Twentyman, whose opinion was held in high regard by manager Bill Shankly. After Twentyman&#x27;s recommendation, Liverpool made an offer for Keegan which Scunthorpe accepted. After Scunthorpe agreed to the fee offered, Keegan was driven the four hours to Liverpool by manager Ron Ashman, who was determined to get a cash influx for the club. Prior to the journey, Keegan&#x27;s father advised Keegan to not sell himself cheap. Keegan negotiated a contract worth £50 a week after Shankly had originally offered him £45. Ashman, sensing the deal may fall through, was at one stage aghast at Keegan&#x27;s negotiation tactics. On the drive back to Scunthorpe, Ashman was critical of Keegan&#x27;s bluff that he was almost earning £45 a week at a fourth division football club. After the negotiation Keegan, 20 years old, was transferred to Liverpool for a fee of £33,000.

Liverpool bought Keegan as a midfielder, but Shankly soon decided to move Keegan up front alongside John Toshack. In a reserve match against Tranmere Rovers, Keegan played right midfield, and after playing with an attacking mindset he was strongly warned by Ronnie Moran that he was &quot;playing too free and easy,&quot; and &quot;nearly playing up front.&quot; Keegan took Moran&#x27;s criticism as a slight, and for a period perceived that Moran strongly had it in for him. As a result of Keegan&#x27;s lack of positional discipline, he was tested up front in a preseason reserve match against Southport. Keegan scored both goals in a 2–1 victory observed by Shankly. Liverpool then tried Keegan in attack at Melwood in a game between the first team and reserves. Keegan played for the first team and scored four in a 7–0 victory. His attacking ability prompted Shankly to keep Keegan up front, and he was immediately deployed as the new strike partner for Toshack. Though Keegan liked Toshack as a teammate, they did not socialise off the pitch, and Keegan said it was strange how quickly they could understand each other&#x27;s play styles. Keegan claimed that the only other player who reached that level of football understanding with him was England international Trevor Brooking. On 14 August 1971, Keegan made his Liverpool debut against Nottingham Forest at Anfield, scoring after 12 minutes. 

In the 1972–73 season, Keegan won his first major titles. As the season was coming to a close, Liverpool was in a tight race with Leeds United and Arsenal for the top spot in the First Division. Don Revie&#x27;s Leeds squad visited Anfield for a showdown on Easter Monday. Two plays on either side of halftime decided the match. First, Leeds&#x27; Peter Lorimer missed an open goal just before halftime. Two minutes after the break, Peter Cormack scored to put Liverpool ahead. Keegan added a late second goal to seal the win. Arsenal dropped a point at Southampton, and Liverpool clinched the title with a 0–0 draw against Leicester City in the final game. This was their first major trophy since 1966. In the UEFA Cup, Liverpool reached the final, where they would face German side Borussia Mönchengladbach. The first leg at Anfield was abandoned after 27 minutes due to a downpour and rescheduled for the next day. The 27 minutes they played gave Shankly an insight into Mönchengladbach&#x27;s defensive vulnerability in the air. To exploit this, he brought tall forward Toshack into the starting team, demoting the smaller Brian Hall, who appeared only as a late substitute. Keegan scored two goals set up by Toshack headers in a 3–0 win. Liverpool lost the second leg 2–0 away, winning the title 3–2 on aggregate.

Keegan was a frequent scorer the following season, but Liverpool lost the league title to a Leeds team that went unbeaten for a then-record 29 games at the start of the season. The team was more successful in the FA Cup. Their campaign in the competition started with a match against the club which had rejected Keegan, Doncaster Rovers, and it was Keegan who scored both Liverpool goals in a 2–2 draw. Liverpool won the replay and advanced. Keegan scored twice more on the way to the cup finals at Wembley Stadium, including a lob-volley over the head Peter Shilton in the semi-final against Leicester City at Villa Park.

In the 1974 final, Liverpool played Newcastle United. Keegan explained Liverpool players were motivated by trash-talk from Newcastle&#x27;s Malcolm Macdonald and John Tudor. Macdonald and Tudor gave pre-game interviews confidently proclaiming superiority over Liverpool and criticizing older Liverpool professionals like Tommy Smith. Keegan also believed Shankly may have got into the heads of the Newcastle players when, on the night before the game, Shankly and Newcastle manager Joe Harvey were being interviewed. Shankly was audible off-camera, stating, &quot;Joe looks a bag of nerves...&quot; Keegan explained it would not have surprised him if this was not an accident, and that Shankly did this to neutralise Newcastle&#x27;s confidence. In the final, Keegan scored two as Liverpool beat Newcastle 3–0. It was the first brace in an FA Cup final since Mike Trebilcock scored twice for Everton in 1966. Keegan claimed that with 100,000 people in attendance, the non-stop chanting of both sets of supporters, and the millions watching on television, this game was as close to a non drug-induced psychedelic experience as he could ever get.

Keegan&#x27;s next visit to Wembley was three months later in the Charity Shield, the traditional curtain-raiser to a new season. The match was contentious and turned violent. Leeds midfielder Johnny Giles punched an unsuspecting Keegan, but was spared sending off after Keegan asked the referee to be lenient. Giles later lunged two-footed at Keegan. Upon Keegan&#x27;s outraged reaction, Billy Bremner challenged Keegan, who then exploded and punched Bremner. Bremner punched back, and they were both sent off, the first time anyone had been sent off in a Charity Shield match. Both players removed their shirts in protest, with Keegan vocally outraged by the decision. Inside the Liverpool dressing room, Bremner approached Keegan to apologise and was met by the fury of Keegan&#x27;s father who had come down to check on his son. The fight was shown that night on BBC. Keegan and Bremner were fined £500 each, with Keegan being suspended for three games and Bremner eight. Despite this, Keegan, Bremner and Giles remained good friends outside of football.

The next year saw Keegan score 12 goals for Liverpool, but the 1974–75 season was a trophyless season. There were numerous honours for Keegan over the next two years, however, as Liverpool again won the League championship and UEFA Cup in the 1975–76 season. Keegan scored in both legs of the UEFA Cup final against FC Bruges, which Liverpool won 4–3 on aggregate.

In the 1976–77 season, Keegan helped Liverpool win the League championship and European Cup. Midway through the season, he announced his intention to leave Liverpool in the summer to play abroad. He scored 20 goals in his final season with the club. Keegan&#x27;s last appearance in a Liverpool shirt on home soil was Liverpool&#x27;s loss in the FA Cup final to bitter rivals Manchester United. The European Cup final in Rome against Borussia Mönchengladbach was four days later. Keegan did not score, but he did make a late run which led to a foul inside the penalty area by Berti Vogts. This led to a penalty which was successfully converted by Phil Neal, sealing a 3–1 win. During the season, on 4 December 1976, Keegan&#x27;s father died of cancer at the age of 71.

After 323 appearances and 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool. He had offers from clubs across Europe, and chose to join Hamburger SV in the West German Bundesliga for £500,000. Liverpool replaced him with Kenny Dalglish. Of his time in Liverpool, Keegan later said, &quot;The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the Kop. I would die if that were to happen. When they start singing &#x27;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&#x27; my eyes start to water. There have been times when I&#x27;ve actually been crying while I&#x27;ve been playing.&quot;

===1977–1980: Hamburger SV===

Keegan&#x27;s transfer to Hamburger SV was agreed between the FA Cup final and the European Cup final of 1977, although Keegan had negotiated a maximum transfer fee the season before. The agreement set the British record transfer record at £500,000, and nearly doubled the German transfer record. Keegan arrived in Germany, joining a club that had not finished higher than sixth in two decades. He told ITV&#x27;s Brian Moore that his annual salary the last season he played for Liverpool was £22,000, whereas at Hamburg it was £122,000.

Following his move to Hamburg, Keegan became an early trendsetter with his new haircut, a perm. On first sight, his wife thought it was hilarious and his agent jokingly tried to disown him in public. Soon though, players such as Bryan Robson, Charlie George, Phil Neal, Terry McDermott also had perms. Later, when Keegan was at Newcastle United as a manager, he and McDermott would joke about the perm in an advertisement. Keegan became Hamburg&#x27;s best-paid player and was billed by the club&#x27;s business manager, Dr. Peter Krohn, as the superstar signing from England who would transform an average German team. Keegan did not feel immediately accepted by his new teammates, and perceived slights from teammates that supported this idea, like making an open run in training but not receiving a pass.

Rules stated that no club was allowed more than two foreign players on its squad. Unbeknownst to Keegan, his transfer had indirectly moved out the three-time European Cup winner Horst Blankenburg. Blankenburg was a very popular member of the squad, and this upset some players. There was also some resentment among the other players who thought that the previous coach, whom the players liked, was replaced by Krohn to accommodate Keegan. It was not until Keegan had moved out of temporary accommodation and moved to a bungalow in the little village of Itzstedt that Keegan began to feel he could make inroads and have a successful career and life in Germany.

In one early interview, Keegan mentioned how he was settling in, he explained how he missed British cereals that he could not find in the supermarkets in Germany. The Hamburg supporters then flooded him with parcels of his favourite cereal with lists of the suppliers. There were language difficulties early on. In one instance in the summer, Keegan went into a hardware shop intending to buy a fuse and he eventually left the shop after buying Christmas lights.

He scored in pre-season friendlies against Barcelona and his former club Liverpool, but Hamburg would later suffer defeat in the European Super Cup final against the latter opposition. Keegan&#x27;s time in Hamburg got off to a bad start as Hamburg lost 5–2 to MSV Duisburg in their first league match. Rudi Gutendorf, the manager some believed was appointed for Keegan, would only last until October.

In the winter break of his first season, feeling isolated by the clique in the dressing room, a frustrated Keegan was sent off in a friendly against lower league club VfB Lübeck. A player in the match was targeting Keegan, and after the third time being smashed, Keegan walked to the goading Lübeck player and punched him. Keegan, who knew he was going to be sent off, walked off the pitch prior to any decision by the referee. Keegan maintains this was his lowest point in Germany. After the incident, he decided to master the German language to fully integrate himself in the team. Up to this point, he did not have the language to ask teammates why they were not passing to him, nor to show them that he too loved the club.

Keegan was suspended for eight weeks and in that time he and the squad made efforts to integrate. He knew the dressing room was turning in his favour when he got invited to the squad nights out. Eventually, one player told him he could get cheap meat for Keegan&#x27;s dogs, and full-back Peter Hidien even got a perm. An unhappy first few months at the club gave way to a more successful season. Although the club finished tenth in the league in the 1977–78 season, Keegan&#x27;s 12 goals helped him pick up a personal honour, the &quot;France Football&quot; European Footballer of the Year award for 1978.

Hamburg appointed Croatian Branko Zebec as a new coach. Zebec was a man who was known to work players to the max. Zebec&#x27;s squad did a lot of running and Keegan claimed he had never been worked as hard in his life. The 1978–79 season saw a vast improvement on the club&#x27;s 1978 finish. A rigorous training regime, Keegan&#x27;s increasing grasp of the German language, and the newly imposed discipline contributed to Hamburg&#x27;s first league championship in nineteen years. The club&#x27;s success also translated into individual recognition for Keegan, who picked up the European Footballer of the Year award for a second consecutive season. Before Keegan, only Alfredo di Stéfano, Franz Beckenbauer and Johan Cruyff had won the award two or more times. As of 2023, six more players have won the award multiple times, bringing the total to ten.

After the 1978–79 season, Juventus, Real Madrid and the Washington Diplomats tried to sign Keegan by offering good terms, but he decided to see out his contract at Hamburg. In 1979, Hamburg supporters gave Keegan the nickname &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; from the popular cartoon superhero from the 1970s and 1980s.

In February 1980, Keegan announced he was leaving after his contract was up. One of the reasons for leaving was Zebec&#x27;s training regime. Keegan had a lot of respect for Zebec, but thought that Zebec&#x27;s extreme fitness regime was flawed for the modern-day footballer. Keegan told Zebec that his training regime was going to burn him out as a footballer, and that he believed he would be finished from playing by 30 if he continued. Zebec, in turn responded to Keegan&#x27;s critique and explained to Keegan it was the same for all the players. Keegan then implied to Zebec that players have different roles and not all players run the same distances on match days; he pointed out to Zebec that because of his role and his effort, on match days not many players in the squad ran as much as himself. After he left the club, drawings were found in Keegan&#x27;s training ground locker depicting Zebec treating the squad as prisoners, with a figure of Keegan counting down the days to his release. The drawings and Keegan&#x27;s personal locker are now held in the Hamburg Museum, under the title &#x27;HSV Legenden&#x27;.

Hamburg&#x27;s European campaign of 1979–80 saw Keegan score two goals to help Hamburg past Dinamo Tbilisi, the Soviet champions who had beaten Liverpool to advance. On the run Hamburg beat Dinamo Tbilisi, Valur, Hajduk Split and Real Madrid. In the first leg against Madrid, they were comfortably beaten 2–0 and most football pundits predicted Hamburg were probably going out. Hamburg beat the odds by winning the return leg 5–1. Keegan regarded this as one of the most outstanding team performances he had the fortune to be a part of. In the final, they played Nottingham Forest. Forest won the game 1–0 with a goal from John Robertson. This cup final defeat was coupled domestically with losing the Bundesliga title to Bayern Munich. Having negotiated a maximum transfer fee of £500,000 in his contract the year before and agreeing to a move in February, Keegan left Hamburg for Southampton in the summer of 1980.

===1980–1982: Southampton===
On 11 February 1980, Southampton boss Lawrie McMenemy called a press conference at the Potters Heron Hotel in Ampfield to announce that Keegan would join the &quot;Saints&quot; in the summer. The news caused surprise throughout the world of football and around the city of Southampton, as they were a relatively small club. The club was beginning to become established in the top division, but this signing showed how persuasive their manager could be. Supporters&#x27; excitement only grew when Keegan captained England at UEFA Euro 1980 in Italy.

Keegan had a clause in his contract with Hamburg that gave Liverpool the option to buy him back. Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause. As late as November 2011, Keegan has stated, &quot;I was with Lawrie [McMenemy] at a charity event the other day, and he said he phoned up Peter Robinson because he wanted me, but Liverpool had a clause. Peter said, &#x27;No, we won&#x27;t be signing him, definitely, we don&#x27;t need him.&#x27;&quot; Southampton snapped him up for £420,000, and Keegan made his Southampton debut at Lansdowne Road in a pre-season friendly against Shamrock Rovers on 23 July 1980.

Keegan&#x27;s two seasons at The Dell saw him as part of a flamboyant team also containing Alan Ball, Phil Boyer, Mick Channon and Charlie George. In 1980–81, the &quot;Saints&quot; scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, their highest league finish to that point.

In the following season, Keegan played some of his best football, and at the beginning of April 1982, Southampton sat at the top of the First Division table. They managed only three wins after February, however, leading to a seventh-place finish, 21 points off first place. Despite this, Keegan was voted the PFA Player of the Year and awarded the OBE for services to Association Football. Keegan had scored 26 of the team&#x27;s 72 league goals and was voted the club&#x27;s Player of the Season by the &quot;Southern Daily Echo&quot;. This second season was the most prolific of his career, scoring 30 goals in all competitions and winning the golden boot.

Keegan fell out with McMenemy over the manager&#x27;s failure to strengthen Southampton&#x27;s defence (which conceded 67 goals in the 1981–82 season) while the team was at the top of the table. There were also rumours that McMenemy had charged the whole team of cheating after a 3–0 defeat by Aston Villa in April 1982, to which Keegan took great exception. Although Keegan joined the &quot;Saints&quot;″ next pre–season tour, he had already decided to move. In 2019, McMenemy explained that prior to the start of the 1982–83 season, Keegan believed that Southampton did not match his footballing ambitions, he had made up his mind and demanded to leave, and there was nothing the club could do about it. A few days before the start of the season, he signed for Newcastle United for a fee of £100,000.

===1982–1984: Newcastle United===
Keegan joined Newcastle United and spent two seasons there, during which time he was extremely popular with the supporters. The press conference to announce his signing was held in the Gosforth Park Hotel. Reacting to the two-time Ballon d&#x27;Or winner joining a second division squad, a local newspaper&#x27;s main headline was simply, &quot;Here he is!&quot;

Keegan always felt at one stage in his career he would play for Newcastle. As a child, Keegan&#x27;s father would tell him football stories about Hughie Gallacher and Jackie Milburn. Keegan claimed that his father would have loved to have seen him playing football in black and white stripes, and to Keegan, playing for Newcastle felt like coming home. There was euphoria in Newcastle at the signing of Keegan and he felt he was there to help the supporters to start believing in themselves. Keegan had never experienced that kind of deification before. He explained, no one could have made him more welcome. People had warned Keegan that whatever he was thinking his welcome would be like, it would not be enough. To Keegan, who had played in a European Cup final, Wembley and Hamburg, the atmosphere on his debut was unique, explaining that the noise on his debut came from all sides of the ground like a surround-sound system. He made his debut and scored his first goal against Queens Park Rangers. After scoring, Keegan did something he had never done before — he instinctively and famously threw himself into the crowd to show the supporters he was one of them. He explained to the press afterwards that &quot;I just wanted to stay there for ever...&quot; Keegan had a fear of letting the supporters down, constantly telling himself, &quot;You can&#x27;t let them down.&quot;

Keegan, along with Terry McDermott, Jeff Clarke and David McCreery, now had senior status at the club. Newcastle manager, Arthur Cox, who would later join many of Keegan&#x27;s coaching staffs, had a different relationship to Keegan than with other players. Cox would ask Keegan his opinion on players. To Keegan, Cox was a task master with a good sense of humour. Cox would condition the players like commandos by having Keegan and his teammates running up and down the hills in Gateshead. In his first season, Newcastle finished fifth, which Keegan maintained was a &quot;flattering&quot; league position, after a faltering season. He finished the season with 21 goals in 37 appearances and won North East Player of the Year.

In September 1983, Keegan answered a phone call at 1:00 am from Cox. In the phone call Cox explained to Keegan that he had signed Peter Beardsley from the Vancouver Whitecaps and suggested that Keegan would like him. A few days later, Keegan met Beardsley at Benwell. Keegan and his teammates thought Beardsley was &quot;just a lad who had won a competition&quot; to train with the first team. It was only when they saw him in action that they knew he had something about him. At Beardsley&#x27;s first training session Keegan could not believe his eyes. Keegan once stated about Beardsley, &quot;At Scunthorpe I always thought Terry Heath had the wow factor, because of his skill on the ball, and when I moved to Liverpool I had never seen anyone with Peter Thompson&#x27;s ability. By the time I started playing for Newcastle, however, I had played against Cruyff, Maradona and Pelé, and yet I have never had my mind blown as I did on the first day I saw Peter Beardsley.&quot;

Keegan announced his retirement prior to the end of the 1983–84 season, on 14 February 1984 — his 33rd birthday. Keegan felt his career was finished after a cup game, a month prior, away at Liverpool. In this match, Keegan was put through on goal from a pass that left him one-on-one with the goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar. He thought this was his moment to put Newcastle 1–0 up in front of the thousands of supporters behind the goal. Before he could finish his move and put the goal away, Keegan was intercepted by the recovering Mark Lawrenson. As Keegan was moving towards goal with his pace, Lawrenson caught up to him and stole the ball off him from the side. At this precise moment, it occurred to Keegan he had now lost his pace. At the end of the game, a frustrated Keegan, while clapping off the supporters, decided this would be his last season as a footballer.

Keegan felt if he were to extend his career at Newcastle in the first division, he would have to adjust his game and move from the attacking role on which he built his footballing identity. Keegan did not want to move back into midfield, and instead decided to retire on a high note.

Keegan&#x27;s last league game was against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, scoring in a 3–1 victory. He played 78 times in his Newcastle career, scoring 48 goals and helping promote them from the Second Division in 1984. His final appearance for Newcastle came in a friendly against Liverpool some days later, leaving the pitch in a helicopter while still dressed in his kit. Alan Shearer, a then-unknown 13-year-old who Keegan would later sign while manager of Newcastle, was a ball boy in Keegan&#x27;s testimonial.

Keegan moved with his family to Spain. He claimed he would never enter football management, but did carry out occasional work as a football pundit for British television.

===1985: Blacktown City===
In April 1985, Keegan briefly came out of retirement to play a two-game stint as a guest player for Blacktown City in Australia&#x27;s National Soccer League. He scored in the first fixture in a 3–2 loss to Canberra City.

==International career==
During 1972, Keegan made five appearances for the England under-23 team, with his only goal coming in a friendly match against East Germany. That same match also saw Keegan receive his first and only red card at international level.

Keegan made his England debut on 15 November 1972 in a 1–0 World Cup qualifying win over Wales. Keegan managed only two appearances during this campaign, both against Wales, as England failed to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. He scored his first international goal in his third appearance, also against Wales, on 11 May 1974. He was given the captaincy by manager Don Revie in 1976 after Gerry Francis fell victim to a long-term injury. He went on to captain England 31 times, retaining the captain&#x27;s armband until his international retirement after the 1982 World Cup.

Keegan captained England at Euro 1980. England failed to progress from the group stage after finishing third in their group behind Italy and Belgium.

He managed only one World Cup appearance, as England failed to qualify for both the 1974 and 1978 tournaments. He finally reached the World Cup in 1982, held in Spain. He was named in the squad for the tournament, but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit to play in any of England&#x27;s group games. In a last desperate effort to play in a World Cup — knowing that he would not be around for the 1986 competition — he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a specialist he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England&#x27;s second-round game against Spain. While on the pitch, he missed a point-blank header which would have put England ahead. England needed to win by a scoreline better than 2–1 to progress to the semi-finals (a 2–1 victory would have left them tied with West Germany). England drew the game 0–0 and were eliminated from the competition.

Following the successful start to the 1982–83 season with Newcastle United, there was much controversy when newly appointed England manager Bobby Robson did not select Keegan for his first squad, a decision Keegan learned of from the media rather than Robson himself. Keegan publicly expressed his displeasure at not being given the courtesy of a phone call from Robson, and never played for his country again. He finished his international career with 63 caps and 21 goals.

==Managerial career==
===Newcastle United===
On 5 February 1992, almost eight years after his final game as a player, Keegan returned to Newcastle United as manager. The club had been relegated from the top flight in 1989 and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1990 after losing in the playoffs to arch-rivals Sunderland. In 1991, they failed to make the playoffs and occupied last place in the Second Division at several stages. Following the dismissal of previous manager Ossie Ardiles, Keegan was appointed to prevent Newcastle from being relegated to the third tier for the first time in club history. The club was suffering from internal struggles and boardroom battles which were holding them back. After three or more years trying, John Hall had recently won the board room from the old regime. Though Hall was not yet confirmed as the chairman, he had accrued enough power to make the key decisions. Hall told board members one hour before Keegan&#x27;s first press conference that Kevin Keegan would be the manager. Keegan had watched only two live matches in seven years. One was the European Cup final in 1991, the other being a goalless draw between Newcastle and Blackburn Rovers; as such, it was suggested that Keegan was unprepared and inexperienced.

When Keegan turned up to Benwell for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. He was surprised at the neglect of the facilities. The training ground was in the process of being sold; despite this, Keegan paid for the clean-up of the grounds with his own money, with the cleaning work being done in one weekend. Keegan felt this clean-up work was an important move and an indirect message to the players that their professionalism had to be high.

Assessing the squad, Keegan felt the team was not good enough to reach the level at which he and Terry McDermott once played. In five-a-sides he and McDermott, both in their 40s with a lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the best players. Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: Lee Clark, Steve Watson, Steve Howey, Alan Thompson and Robbie Elliott. These young players would form the core of Keegan&#x27;s Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997. Keegan noted Watson would take throw-ins via a somersault throw and this amused and shocked him. He regarded it as a gimmick and could not believe the club&#x27;s supporters would take joy in it. The throw-in, to Keegan, was a sign of how far Newcastle had fallen. He wanted the club to be known for scoring goals and thrilling football. Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped Clark. Though he liked Clark&#x27;s spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off. Prior to the game, Keegan arranged a training match for the reserves and included himself to make up the numbers. In the training match, a frustrated Clark went through the back of Keegan in a knee-high tackle on a hospital pass, in a similar way to a Romeo Benetti tackle on Keegan in an England–Italy match. A melee ensued, resulting in Pavel Srníček swinging a roundhouse kick at Clark&#x27;s head. Keegan was not upset and he did not punish either player. To Keegan, Srníček and Clark&#x27;s response showed they cared about their football. Keegan&#x27;s first game, against Bristol City, ended in 3–0 victory in front of a capacity crowd.

On 14 March 1992, following a 3–1 win over Swindon Town, Keegan became frustrated with Hall. Keegan had been not given the transfer funds he was promised. As a result of this frustration, Keegan briefly walked out on the team. This resulted in a phone call between Keegan and Hall, where they settled their differences, and where Hall guaranteed millions of pounds to spend on new players. Further assessing his squad, Keegan noted some players could not handle the pressure and would sneak in by a turnstile rather than meet and greet the big crowds at the front entrance prior to games. Keegan decided to move these players on. With the club&#x27;s transfer funds Keegan decided he needed a leader in the team. Keegan signed the experienced Brian Kilcline. Keegan stated about Kilcline, &quot;Even on his bad days his head never dropped, he was tough as teak, absolutely fearless&quot;, and &quot;He was a ready-made captain, one of my more important signings as Newcastle&#x27;s manager.&quot; Keegan&#x27;s managerial guidance in the 1991–92 season helped Newcastle finish 20th out of 24 teams in the Second Division, avoiding relegation. This meant, with the establishment of the new Premier League, the team would play in the new First Division for the 1992–93 season.

Prior to the 1992–93 season, Keegan strengthened the defence with the acquisition of Barry Venison from Liverpool and John Beresford from Portsmouth. Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season. The club-record signing of Bristol City striker Andy Cole in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of Charlton Athletic&#x27;s Rob Lee bolstered the midfield in the autumn. Newcastle finished first in the First Division, eight points clear of second-place West Ham United, and were promoted to the Premier League as First Division champions. Top scorer David Kelly and influential midfielder Gavin Peacock were both sold after the season, and Keegan brought striker Peter Beardsley back to Newcastle from Everton, six years after he had been sold by Newcastle to Liverpool.

The 1993–94 season was an enormous success for Newcastle as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup, bringing European football to the club for the first time since the 1970s. Cole was the Premier League&#x27;s top scorer with 34 goals in 40 games, and he set a club record with a total of 41 goals in all competitions. Keegan then strengthened his side by signing Swiss defender Marc Hottiger, Belgian defensive midfielder Philippe Albert, and Norwich City&#x27;s quick winger, Ruel Fox.

Newcastle won their first six games of the 1994–95 season to top the league and they appeared capable of winning their first league title since 1927. The shock departure of Cole to Manchester United in January weakened their attack, and they finished the season in sixth place—not enough for another UEFA Cup campaign. In the meantime, autumn signing Paul Kitson was partnered with Beardsley in attack. Keegan made several important additions to the Newcastle side in the summer of 1995: Reading goalkeeper Shaka Hislop, Paris Saint-Germain&#x27;s French winger David Ginola, Queens Park Rangers striker Les Ferdinand, and Wimbledon defender Warren Barton. Ferdinand was Newcastle&#x27;s biggest signing at £6 million, while the £4 million paid for Barton was the highest fee paid for a defender in English football at the time.

Newcastle excelled in the first half of the 1995–96 season, leading the league by ten points on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2–0 defeat at West Ham on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1–0 defeat at the hands of fellow title-challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March. Within two weeks, Newcastle&#x27;s lead evaporated and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle&#x27;s 4–3 defeat to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered to be a classic Premier League match. With two games remaining, Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle managed a 1–1 draw against Nottingham Forest on 2 May, and another 1–1 draw against Tottenham Hotspur on the final day of the season. The title was won by Manchester United, whose 3–0 triumph at Middlesbrough would have been enough to win, regardless of Newcastle&#x27;s result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as Ferdinand, Ginola, Beardsley, Lee, Darren Peacock, and Faustino Asprilla would have stayed together, built up momentum, and won more trophies.

During the race for the 1995–96 title, Keegan directed remarks at the Manchester United manager, Alex Ferguson, during a post-match interview live on Sky Sports. His outburst—&quot;I would love it if we beat them! Love it!&quot;—is frequently referred to when describing their relationship. In April 2003, it was named as Quote of the Decade in the Premier League 10 Seasons Awards and Most Memorable Quote in the 20 Seasons Awards in May 2012. It also appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Sporting Moments&quot;.

Keegan then broke the world transfer fee record by signing striker Alan Shearer from Blackburn in July 1996. Shearer, who had been the Premier League&#x27;s top scorer the last two seasons, was born in Newcastle and had grown up as a fan of the club. He made an instant impact on his native Tyneside. The club lost in his debut, a 4–0 Charity Shield defeat at the hands of Manchester United, but redeemed themselves two months later with a 5–0 victory against the same opposition, in which Shearer scored. Newcastle briefly led the league at several stages in the first half of the season, and Shearer led the league scoring 25 goals.

On 8 January 1997, Keegan announced his resignation as manager. A club statement following his resignation read:

Newcastle United Football Club today announce the resignation of manager Kevin Keegan. Kevin informed the board of his wish to resign at the end of the season, having decided he no longer wishes to continue in football management at this stage in his life. Following lengthy discussions of which the board attempted to persuade Kevin to change his mind, both parties eventually agreed that the best route forward was for the club to, reluctantly, accept his resignation with immediate effect.

Keegan left the club with a short statement reading:It was my decision and my decision alone to resign. I feel I have taken the club as far as I can, and that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned now. I wish the club and everyone concerned with it all the best for the future.

On the Newcastle United DVD &quot;Magpie Magic&quot;, it is said that chairman John Hall asked for a long-term commitment as manager from him, which Keegan was unwilling to give. It also states that the pressure and criticism of selling Cole, and the failed title challenge in the 1995–96 season, took a toll on him.

He was succeeded by Kenny Dalglish, the same man who had replaced him as a player at Liverpool 20 years earlier. Newcastle finished second place that season, and in the following season, finished outside the top ten in the Premier League, although they were FA Cup runners-up. They did not return to the top five of the Premier League until the 2001–02 season, when they finished fourth under Bobby Robson.

It was during his time as coach that Keegan gained the nickname &quot;King Kev&quot; from Newcastle supporters.

===Fulham===
Keegan returned to football on 25 September 1997 as chief operating officer at Second Division Fulham, with Ray Wilkins as head coach. Fulham finished sixth in the final table, but Wilkins was sacked just before the first leg of the playoff semi-final and Keegan took over as manager.

His appointment came a few months after the takeover of the club by Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, who gave Keegan £10 million to spend on players that season. That was the first part of a £40 million attempt to deliver Premier League football to the Craven Cottage club, who had been outside the top flight since 1968, and had not played in the league&#x27;s second tier since 1986.

Keegan was unable to inspire Fulham to overcome Grimsby Town in the playoffs, but good form in the 1998–99 season—helped by the acquisition of players who would normally have signed with Premier League or First Division clubs—clinched them the Second Division title and promotion to First Division. Keegan left at the end of the season to concentrate on his duties as England manager, having succeeded Glenn Hoddle in February 1999.

Fulham replaced Keegan with Paul Bracewell and reached the Premier League two years later under Bracewell&#x27;s successor, Jean Tigana. The squad still featured many of the players bought by Keegan or Wilkins.

===England===

After weeks of speculation, Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999. He succeeded Glenn Hoddle, who had been sacked two weeks earlier for a newspaper interview in which he suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life. Keegan led the team to a winning start with 3–1 victory over Poland to reignite England&#x27;s campaign to qualify for Euro 2000 in Group 5 following a slow start to the qualifiers. Points dropped in draws against Sweden, Bulgaria, and the return fixture against Poland left England facing elimination as the end of the qualifying stages neared. Poland lost their last match to Sweden, and England finished second in the group to gain a place in the qualification playoff with Scotland. Two goals from Paul Scholes gave them a 2–0 win in the first leg, and despite a 1–0 defeat in the second leg, they qualified for the championships for the fourth straight tournament.

This success brought goodwill, but Keegan began to come under fire for his perceived tactical naivety. This came to a head during the unsuccessful Euro 2000 tournament. England began with a 3–2 defeat against Portugal, despite having a 2–0 lead after 17 minutes. England beat Germany 1-0 in their next game, the first English victory over Germany in a competitive match since the 1966 World Cup final. In the final group game against Romania, England once again lost 3–2, this time after taking a 2–1 lead, and their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals were over. Despite this disappointment, Keegan remained in charge of the national side for a while longer.

Keegan resigned as England manager on 7 October 2000. This came after England lost to Germany in their first 2002 World Cup qualifier, the last game played at Wembley Stadium before the old stadium was rebuilt. Keegan won only 38.9% of his games in charge, the lowest such percentage of any permanent England manager—although unlike Don Revie (1974–1977) or Steve McClaren (2006–2007), Keegan achieved qualification to a major tournament for England.

When Sven-Göran Eriksson became England manager, he appointed the 64-year-old Tord Grip as his assistant. This caused Keegan to complain that when he was England manager, the FA had told him that he could not have Arthur Cox as his assistant because at 60, Cox was too old for the role, although he was allowed a lesser role on the coaching staff. Keegan went on, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t allowed to bring in the people I wanted and that was wrong. Mr. Eriksson was and I&#x27;m delighted for him because that&#x27;s the way it should be.&quot;

===Manchester City===
On 24 May 2001, Keegan returned to football as successor to Joe Royle at Manchester City, who had just been relegated from the Premier League. Keegan signed experienced international players such as Stuart Pearce, Eyal Berkovic and Ali Benarbia. That season, City were promoted as First Division champions after scoring 108 league goals. Keegan was the first manager in the Premier League era to win the First Division title with two different clubs.

In preparation for his second season as manager (2002–03), he signed Nicolas Anelka, Peter Schmeichel and Marc-Vivien Foé. That season saw mixed results. City beat Liverpool at Anfield and took four points from Manchester United (their previous win in the Manchester derby being in September 1989), but conceded five goals away to Chelsea and again at home to Arsenal. They secured their Premier League status comfortably by finishing ninth. Keegan also guided City into the UEFA Cup, qualifying via the UEFA Fair Play ranking.

For the 2003–04 season, the club&#x27;s first season at the new City of Manchester Stadium, Keegan added Steve McManaman, Paul Bosvelt, David Seaman and Michael Tarnat to City&#x27;s squad. City started well and were fifth in the league by the start of November. However, a draw at home to Polish minnows Groclin led to their second-round elimination from the UEFA Cup, which was followed by a slump in form. City did not win again in the league until 21 February, and finished 16th in the league. The most notable match of the season came at Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup on 4 February 2004. Despite being down 3–0 at halftime (with ten men after Joey Barton was sent off), City came back to win 4–3.

The 2004–05 season brought better form for City, but Keegan agreed to leave as manager on 10 March 2005 after telling the chairman his desire to retire from football at the end of the season. The club went on to finish eighth under his successor Stuart Pearce, and only missed out on a UEFA Cup place when Robbie Fowler missed a penalty in stoppage time of a 1–1 draw with Middlesbrough on the last day of the season. Earlier that season, while still under Keegan&#x27;s management, City beat Chelsea 1–0 which turned out to be the only defeat in the league that season for Chelsea, who ended up as Premier League champions.

After declaring his retirement from football in 2005, Keegan remained out of the media spotlight, working at the Soccer Circus football school in Glasgow. In October 2007, he indicated he was unlikely to manage again.

===Return to Newcastle===

Following the dismissal of manager Sam Allardyce, Keegan made an unexpected return to Newcastle United on 16 January 2008. Newcastle supporters welcomed the manager back as he arrived to see the FA Cup third-round replay against Stoke City, alongside owner Mike Ashley and chairman Chris Mort. He managed his first game at the club since 1997 against Bolton Wanderers on 19 January. He awarded the club captaincy to Michael Owen, stating, &quot;He&#x27;s not scared to give his opinion when he&#x27;s right, and he&#x27;s not scared to say what he feels. He&#x27;s a tremendous professional, and he trains properly every day.&quot; Keegan announced on 22 January that he and Alan Shearer held talks about the two linking up, with Shearer as his assistant, but decided against the idea, leaving the door open for Shearer to take other roles.

Keegan&#x27;s first eight games back at Newcastle passed without a win. On 22 March, Newcastle earned the first win of Keegan&#x27;s second managerial spell, a 2–0 victory against his former club, Fulham. The team followed it up with wins over Tottenham Hotspur and Sunderland, maintaining his perfect record over the club&#x27;s local rivals in the Tyne-Wear derby, and also putting Newcastle on top of the league&#x27;s form chart. This run of good form was hugely thanks to a new 4–3–3 formation, spearheaded by the productive strike trio of Owen, Obafemi Martins and Mark Viduka. The trio scored 11 of the club&#x27;s 14 goals in this run, which safely secured the club from a relegation battle. Newcastle&#x27;s seven-game unbeaten run came to an end in a home defeat to Chelsea, and they finished the season in 12th place.

That summer, Newcastle signed Argentine winger Jonás Gutiérrez, as well as his countryman, defender Fabricio Coloccini from Deportivo de La Coruña, among others. Newcastle began the 2008–09 season with a 1–1 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford, having lost the previous season&#x27;s fixtures 6–0 and 5–1. They beat Bolton 1–0 the following week, and Coventry City 3–2 in the second round of the League Cup on 26 August.

====Resignation====
As the 2007–08 season drew to a close, rumours of tensions between the club&#x27;s directors and Keegan began to surface, as he publicly criticised the board, claiming they were not providing him the financial support necessary to break into the top four of the Premier League standings. His accusations caused bad press for owner Mike Ashley, who was already battling reports that he had lost hundreds of millions of pounds in a disastrous stock market venture.

Following the closure of the transfer window at midnight on 1 September 2008, various media sources reported that Keegan had either resigned from the club or had been sacked, leading to fan protests around St James&#x27; Park. The club released statements denying that Keegan had left, but stated that talks were ongoing between the manager and members of the board. On 4 September, Keegan issued a statement confirming that he had resigned the same day, stating that, &quot;A manager must have the right to manage and that clubs should not impose upon any manager any player that he does not want.&quot; Late on 12 September, it was reported Keegan met Ashley in London in an attempt to resolve their differences, but the meeting ended without a satisfactory conclusion for either party.

Richard Bevan, chief executive of the League Managers Association (LMA), stated the following month that Keegan would consider a return to the club but only if those who held the ownership were willing to develop a structure which he was happy with. The club was also warned by the LMA on 5 September to develop a structure which would satisfy the next manager to replace Keegan to avoid a similar situation repeating itself and damaging the club&#x27;s image. Following Dennis Wise&#x27;s resignation as director of football in April 2009, many supporters directed the blame for Keegan&#x27;s exit at both Wise and Ashley, as a result of such a position being established and poorly used.

====Premier League Arbitration Panel====
In December 2008, it was reported that, following Mike Ashley&#x27;s decision to withdraw the sale of Newcastle, a legal dispute over Keegan&#x27;s departure from had arisen; Keegan claimed unfair dismissal and Ashley claimed damage to his public image. In September 2009, it was reported that Keegan had met with Ashley and the Newcastle board — including former members — in a Premier League arbitration hearing for a claim of £10 million in compensation for his shock resignation. All sides agreed to the arbitration being held publicly.

Keegan&#x27;s dispute with the club was resolved in October 2009. The tribunal ruled in favour of Keegan, agreeing that Newcastle had constructively dismissed him by insisting on the signing of midfielder Nacho González on loan, against his wishes. The move was made to replace James Milner following his move to Aston Villa, after a bid for Bayern Munich&#x27;s Bastian Schweinsteiger was rejected. Although Wise&#x27;s signing of Spanish striker Xisco was not mentioned in the hearing, Keegan stated that this had also been a central factor in his departure.

The ruling was based around seven issues. The panel declared that Keegan had been led to believe he had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, nor by word of mouth that he did not, nor that his role would see him report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premier League manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect that this was not a factor. The club&#x27;s signing of González meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While González was the main issue in the decision, the club&#x27;s alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he not agree to the terms they offered, as well as his decision to remain at the club until 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the ruling in Keegan&#x27;s favour. Keegan was awarded £2 million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal. Keegan stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.

In pursuit of winning the tribunal, the club admitted to misleading the media and their supporters. Several key senior staff, including Dennis Wise and Derek Llambias, had publicly claimed that Keegan had &quot;the final word&quot;; they claimed to the tribunal that this was not in fact the case and that their claims were just &quot;PR&quot;. It was then revealed that Wise asked Keegan to sign González after watching him &quot;on YouTube&quot;. On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal. They reached this conclusion based on their view that the club&#x27;s &quot;defence on the primary liability issue was, in our view, wholly without merit&quot;.

Keegan stated after the hearing he still wanted to manage top flight football, and would consider returning to his position at the club, but felt the supporters may be exhausted from his last tenure and would prefer him not to. In June 2013, Keegan stated he would only consider a return should Ashley leave the club. Over the years, Keegan continued to criticise Ashley, accusing him of a lack of respect for the supporters. Following the sale of Newcastle United to the Public Investment Fund, Keegan spoke publicly at an event in Cramlington, stating his delight at Ashley&#x27;s departure and excitement at the new ownership&#x27;s ability to compete financially with the wealthiest football clubs in the world.

==Media appearances==

In 1976, Keegan competed on BBC&#x27;s television programme &quot;Superstars&quot;. Despite suffering severe cuts after crashing his bicycle, he insisted on re-racing and secured second place in the event, before going on to win that edition of the programme. He also advertised Brut aftershave alongside boxer Henry Cooper.

In 1979, Keegan and his wife were featured on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Brian Moore meets Kevin Keegan&quot;, a documentary filmed over the course of the season. Cameras documented activities at the family&#x27;s Hamburg home and Keegan&#x27;s personal business appearances, offering a rare glimpse into the life of a modern millionaire footballer away from the pitch.

The same year, during his daughter&#x27;s christening reception at a London hotel, Eamonn Andrews, the presenter of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, emerged from a giant cake to surprise Keegan and his guests with his famous big red book. The television show was broadcast on Keegan&#x27;s 28th birthday, ten days later. Keegan quipped, &quot;I&#x27;m so glad that I wore brown trousers.&quot;

He narrated the 90-minute documentary &quot;Keegan on Keegan&quot;, released via Castle Vision on VHS cassette in 1992.

In August 2009, nearly a year after his departure from Newcastle, Keegan resurfaced after being confirmed as the lead pundit on ESPN UK. During the course of the 2010 World Cup, Keegan featured as a pundit for ITV broadcasts. He was part of ESPN&#x27;s live coverage of the 2011, 2012 and 2013 FA Cup finals, with pitch-side build-up and post-match commentary.

===Music===
Keegan released a single in 1972 titled &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;. His song &quot;Head Over Heels in Love&quot;, written by Chris Norman and Pete Spencer, was released on 9 June 1979. It peaked at number 31 in the UK charts, but climbed to number 10 in Germany where Keegan was based at the time, and where Norman&#x27;s band Smokie was popular. He released another single, &quot;England&quot;, on his return to England from Germany, but it failed to chart.

==Personal life==
In September 1970, Keegan met his future wife, Jean Woodhouse, on the Waltzers at Doncaster fair. They married on 23 September 1974 and have two daughters. Early on in his career at Liverpool, Keegan dropped his first name Joseph and adopted his middle name, signing his autograph as &#x27;Kevin Keegan&#x27;, instead of the &#x27;JK Keegan&#x27; that he scribbled at Scunthorpe United.

Keegan became renowned for his &quot;poodle perm&quot; hair in the 1970s, and has regularly appeared at the top of &quot;worst hairstyles&quot; surveys.

In July 2008, Flybe International announced the naming of one of their new Bombardier Q400 aircraft in honour of Keegan&#x27;s service to Newcastle United, both as a player and as manager. The plane was used on the regular service from Newcastle International Airport to London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport.

He is known for aiding charities, including appearances at cricket matches for Lord&#x27;s Taverners and Sussex Cricket Club.

In April 1991, he was attacked while sleeping in his Range Rover by the M25 at Reigate Hill in Surrey. His assailants later said in court that they needed money for a drug debt and had no idea they were attacking Keegan.

<text>The Wassermann test or Wassermann reaction (WR) is an antibody test for syphilis, named after the bacteriologist August Paul von Wassermann, based on complement fixation. It was the first blood test for syphilis and the first in the nontreponemal test (NTT) category. Newer NTTs, such as the RPR and VDRL tests, have mostly replaced it. During the mid-20th century, in many jurisdictions, including most US states, applicants for a marriage license were required by law to undergo a Wassermann test.

==Method==
A sample of blood or cerebrospinal fluid is taken and introduced to the antigen – cardiolipin extracted from bovine muscle or heart. Syphilis non-specific antibodies (reagin, see RPR) react with the lipid – the Wassermann reaction of antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs). The intensity of the reaction (classed 1, 2, 3, or 4) indicates the severity of the condition.

==Uncertainty==

The reaction is not specific to syphilis and will produce a positive reaction to other diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, malaria, and tuberculosis. It is possible for an infected individual to produce no reaction and for a successfully treated individual to continue to produce a reaction (known as being &quot;Wassermann fast&quot; or &quot;fixed&quot;).

The Wassermann test is ineffective at identifying primary syphilis as sufficient reagin has not yet been produced from tissue destruction at this stage. Therefore, more effective methods have been a common research topic.

==Development and refinement==
The antibody test was developed by Wassermann, Julius Citron, and Albert Neisser at the Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases in 1906. The test was a growth from the work of Bordet and Gengou on complementing-fixation reaction, published in 1901, and the positive reaction is sometimes called the Bordet-Gengou-Wassermann reaction or Bordet-Wassermann reaction.

The Wassermann test has been refined with the Kahn test and the Kolmer test, and it is rarely used today. Replacement tests such as the VDRL test and the RPR test, initially based on flocculation techniques (Hinton), have been shown to produce far fewer false positive results. Indeed, the &quot;biologic false positives&quot; of modern tests usually indicate a serious alternate condition, often an autoimmune disease.

<text>&quot;Hate You&quot; is a single by American punk rock band Daredevils, the side project of Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz that followed after his exit from Bad Religion in 1994.

The band has only released one single with two songs on it, &quot;Hate You&quot; and &quot;Rules, Hearts&quot;. &quot;Hate You&quot; was allegedly about the Bad Religion bassist Jay Bentley, who said that Brett left Bad Religion for money.

Josh Freese, who drummed on this album was jokingly/incorrectly credited as Josh Freeze.

<doc id="346987" wikidata="Q278315" url="?curid=346987" title="Referendum Party">
<text>The Referendum Party was a Eurosceptic, single-issue political party that was active in the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1997. The party&#x27;s sole objective was for a referendum to be held on the nature of the UK&#x27;s membership of the European Union (EU). Specifically, it called for a referendum on whether the British electorate wanted to be part of a federal European state or to revert to being a sovereign nation that was part of a European free-trade bloc without wider political functions.

The Referendum Party was founded by the Anglo-French multi-millionaire businessman and politician James Goldsmith in November 1994. A Eurosceptic who had previously had close links to the UK&#x27;s governing Conservative Party, he was also an elected Member of the European Parliament for the Movement for France party. He used his financial resources and contacts to promote the new venture, in which he was assisted by other former Conservatives. The party&#x27;s structure was centralised and hierarchical, giving Goldsmith near-total control over its operations. Although not offering party membership, it claimed to have 160,000 registered &quot;supporters&quot;, a number that was probably an exaggeration. The party gained a Member of Parliament (MP) for two weeks in 1997, when George Gardiner, the MP for Reigate, defected to it from the Conservatives shortly before that year&#x27;s general election.

In the build-up to the May 1997 general election, the Referendum Party spent more on press advertising than either the incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the Labour Party. It stood candidates in 547 of the 659 constituencies, more than any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. Ultimately the party gained 811,827 votes, representing 2.6% of the national total; it failed to win any seats in the House of Commons. Support was strongest in southern and eastern England, and weakest in inner London, northern England, and Scotland. Following the election, psephologists argued that the impact of the Referendum Party deprived Conservative candidates of victory in somewhere between four and sixteen parliamentary seats. In the months following the election, the party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith died in July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly afterward. Some of its supporters reformed as a Eurosceptic pressure group called the Democracy Movement while many others joined Eurosceptic political parties like the UK Independence Party and the Democratic Party.

==Formation==
===Background and ideology===
The United Kingdom joined the European Communities (EC) in 1973. Following the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 the EC became the European Union.The UK&#x27;s ratification of the treaty in 1992, followed by its passing of the European Communities (Finance) Act in 1994–95, generated much controversy and infighting within the UK&#x27;s Conservative Party, which was then in government under Prime Minister John Major. This caused considerable damage to Major&#x27;s administration, which was increasingly unpopular among the British population. Various British newspapers, among them &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;, had adopted a consistently Eurosceptic position. Opinion polls suggested growing opposition to aspects of the EU in the UK. More widely, the acceleration of the EU&#x27;s integration process had resulted in the growth of Eurosceptic parties across many of its member states.

The Anglo-French businessman James Goldsmith announced the formation of the Referendum Party on 27 November 1994. Goldsmith had once been a strong supporter of the EC but had grown disenchanted with it during the early 1990s, becoming particularly concerned that it was forming into a superstate governed by centralised institutions in Brussels. He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic protectionist, he was also critical of the EU&#x27;s signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, believing that global free trade would damage both the EU&#x27;s economy and his own business interests.

Goldsmith had prior political experience, having been elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in France as part of the Eurosceptic Movement for France coalition in June 1994. Although his father had been a Member of Parliament representing Britain&#x27;s Conservative Party, and he had personally had a close relationship to the party when it was led by Margaret Thatcher, Goldsmith wanted to launch his campaign independently of the Conservatives, hoping that it could draw on cross-party concerns about the direction of the EU. At the time of the party&#x27;s formation, Goldsmith had an estimated personal wealth of £800 million, and promised to put £20 million into the party. He pledged to spend at least £10 million on campaigning for the next general election, to ensure that his party was funded to the same extent as the country&#x27;s larger political parties. Goldsmith&#x27;s intervention in British politics has been compared with that of the multi-millionaires Ross Perot in the United States and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy.

According to the political scientists Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford, the Referendum Party was &quot;a classic single-issue party&quot;. Similarly, the political scientists Neil Carter, Mark Evans, Keith Alderman, and Simon Gorham described it as a &quot;single-issue movement&quot; that had attributes of both a political party and a pressure group. While it took part in elections, it focused on a single issue and stated that if it got Members of Parliament (MP) elected their sole aim would be to secure a referendum. It also claimed that on achieving its main aim, the party would disband, unlike most political parties; as Goldsmith put in his October 1995 &quot;Statement of Aims&quot;: &quot;This is a single-issue biodegradable party which will be dissolved once we have achieved our aim.&quot;

The referendum question which the party proposed was announced on 28 November 1996: &quot;Do you want the United Kingdom to be part of a federal Europe or do you want the United Kingdom to return to an association of sovereign nations that are part of a common trading market?&quot; The political scientists David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh noted that this question was often mocked for its &quot;unrealistic ambiguity&quot;, and some journalists referred to Goldsmith&#x27;s venture as the &quot;Referendum Only Party&quot;. Goldsmith did not position the party as explicitly opposed to the EU, instead stating that it was &quot;wholly agnostic&quot; about EU membership and just wanted to secure a referendum on the issue. The wording of the party&#x27;s main question led one group of political scientists to note that it &quot;clearly revealed Goldsmith&#x27;s Eurosceptic colours&quot; and that the wider pronouncements of the party became increasingly Eurosceptic as time went on.

===Establishment and growth===

In its first year, the Referendum Party had little established organisation and largely remained a concept with limited concrete presence. Goldsmith&#x27;s finances had allowed its appearance to be accompanied with mass publicity but it lacked the standard machinery of a political party, such as a mass membership or politically experienced personnel. To counter this problem, Goldsmith sought to create a sophisticated administrative centre and to secure the expertise to carry out a political campaign, establishing his headquarters in London. By October 1995, the party had established a hierarchical structure consisting of three tiers: the centre, region and constituency. Operating the centre was Goldsmith and a cabinet whose membership included Lord McAlpine, who was a former treasurer of the Conservative Party, and two former members of the Conservative Central Office staff. The centre had around 50 staff, who relayed Goldsmith&#x27;s instructions through to the ten regional co-ordinators, who in turn transmitted them to the prospective candidates in the constituencies. This top-down and undemocratic structure concentrated decision making with Goldsmith and the centre and provided little autonomy for the regions and constituencies, although this was deemed necessary to ensure efficiency in its campaign.

Rather than having members who paid a joining fee, the Referendum Party had &quot;supporters&quot; who could voluntarily donate money if they wished. By February 1997, the party claimed that it had 160,000 registered supporters, although some of these individuals had only requested information about it and had not actively registered as &quot;supporters&quot;. The party issued a newspaper, &quot;News from the Referendum Party&quot;, to attract wider attention to its aims and broaden its support. One issue, published in February 1996, was delivered to 24 million households at an estimated cost of £2 million.

The party also sought to attract the support of prominent figures from business, the arts, and academia, inviting them to its major events. In October 1996, it held a national conference in Brighton, in which forty speakers addressed an audience of 5,000. Among the speakers were the actor Edward Fox, the ecologist David Bellamy, the politician George Thomas, and the zookeeper John Aspinall. The conference had been staged largely to impress the media, at a cost of £750,000, although unsympathetic media outlets were reportedly banned from attending. By the time of the conference, the party was increasingly reflecting its Eurosceptic intentions, particularly with the use of slogans like &quot;No Surrender to Brussels&quot;.

Early supporters fell largely into three types: committed Eurosceptics, disaffected Conservatives, and those who—though not necessarily being Eurosceptic—strongly believed that the British population deserved a referendum on EU membership. At the time the new party was largely seen as a threat to the governing Conservative Party, which was experiencing high levels of mid-term unpopularity. In September 1995, the party began recruiting candidates to contest the next general election. Goldsmith was also able to obtain celebrity endorsements. Despite Goldsmith&#x27;s longstanding criticism of the mainstream media—he had previously stated that &quot;reporting in England is a load of filth&quot;—the party used its finances to promote its message in the media. It hired Ian Beaumont, who had formerly been the press officer to Thatcher&#x27;s government, to work for it. The party paid for many full-page and some double-page advertisement in the UK&#x27;s national newspapers, as well as two cinema advertisements. This generated criticism from those who accused it of &quot;cheque-book politics&quot; in the manner of Perot in the US. This financial backing and infrastructure contrasted with that of another single-issue Eurosceptic Party, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which was operating with little finances and a skeleton organisation at the time.

Although the party had faced criticism and mockery, it gained much media exposure.
Two months before the 1997 election, the party gained an MP in the House of Commons when George Gardiner, the Conservative MP for Reigate, switched allegiance to the Referendum Party after his local Conservative branch deselected him due to critical comments that he had made about Major.

==1997 general election==

By the time of the 1997 general election, polls suggested that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country&#x27;s ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, with mainstream newspapers like the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK&#x27;s recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.

===Campaign===
The Referendum Party did not contest any of the by-elections in 1996 and 1997. For the 1997 general election, it hurried its selection of candidates, who had only one interview—and no background checks or screening—before acceptance. The funding for each candidate&#x27;s official campaign was supplied entirely by the party centre. Candidates were brought to a training day at a Manchester hotel in February 1997, where they were presented with several hours of speeches and given a handbook. Many felt that the event had been a public relations exercise rather than a concerted effort to train candidates.

Goldsmith&#x27;s party was the biggest spender on press advertising in the 1997 campaign; it spent three times as much as the Conservatives and five times as much as Labour on press adverts. Its media profile greatly eclipsed that of UKIP. Goldsmith also used his financial resources to deliver a videocassette to five million UK households in March 1997. This was a novel strategy in British politics, and was conceived as a way of reaching the electorate while bypassing the mass media. The packaging of the videocassette did not specify that it was produced by the Referendum Party but rather carried several slogans: &quot;The most important video you&#x27;ll ever watch&quot;, &quot;The story the politicians don&#x27;t want you to hear&quot;, and &quot;If you care about Britain, please pass this video on.&quot; The 12-minute film, presented by the former &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; presenter Gavin Campbell, warned of a coming &quot;federal European super-state&quot;. In his analysis of the video, scholar David Hass argued that the film was deliberately designed to elicit fear in the viewer, something achieved through &quot;eerie sound effects&quot;, the image of a blue stain spreading across a map of Europe, and slow-motion shots of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl striding towards the screen. In Hass&#x27; view, the film &quot;manifestly reduced that complex issue of Europe to the lowest common denominator, and aimed to shock.&quot;

The BBC also permitted the party one five-minute party political broadcast because it was fielding over 50 candidates. The party insisted that it should have three such broadcasts, but the BBC claimed that this was disproportionate for a smaller, new party with no elected representation. The party took the issue to the High Court of Justice, which sided with the BBC. The broadcast featured Goldsmith talking directly to the camera, arguing for a referendum. Goldsmith implied that the BBC had a pro-EU agenda by referring to it as the &quot;Brussels News Corporation&quot;, also claiming that there was a &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot; negatively impacting the coverage received by his party.

In 1996, both the Conservative and Labour Parties committed to the idea that they would require a referendum on any proposed economic and monetary union with the EU; the Liberal Democrats had already committed to this idea. It is difficult to quantify what role the Referendum Party had on the adoption of this position. Goldsmith condemned the Conservatives&#x27; pledge as an &quot;empty gesture&quot;. Concerned that they would lose votes to the Referendum Party, many in the Conservative Party were pressing Major to enter talks with Goldsmith, although the Prime Minister refused to engage in any formal dialogue. The electoral threat posed by Goldsmith&#x27;s party was taken seriously among the Conservatives, with senior party figures like Major, Ken Clarke, Douglas Hurd, Brian Mawhinney and Michael Heseltine launching vitriolic and often personal criticisms of Goldsmith and his group. Hurd declared that &quot;the government&#x27;s policy must not be put at the mercy of millionaires who play with British politics as a hobby or as a boost to newspaper sales&quot;.

In the general election, candidates for the Referendum Party stood in 547 constituencies, the most that any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. None of these candidates were in Northern Ireland. This was because Goldsmith had made an agreement with Northern Ireland&#x27;s Ulster Unionist Party that he would not field any candidates against them if their one MEP joined his Europe of Nations grouping in the European Parliament, something that ensured that the grouping remained large enough to retain its Parliamentary funding. It also avoided putting up candidates in constituencies where the leading candidate (65 of them Conservatives, 26 Labour and 2 Liberal Democrats) was considered sympathetic to the Referendum Party&#x27;s call for a referendum. Goldsmith appeared to acknowledge that it was unlikely to win any of the contested seats, stating that the party&#x27;s success would be &quot;judged solely by its total number of votes&quot;. The party officially launched its electoral campaign on 9 April 1997 at Newlyn in Cornwall, where Goldsmith sought to whip up Eurosceptic sentiment among fishermen who were angry with the restrictions imposed by EU fishing quotas.

===Results===
In the election, which took place on 1 May 1997, the Referendum Party polled 811,827 votes. This represented 2.6% of the national total, and the party averaged 3.1% in the seats which it contested. 42 of the party&#x27;s candidates gained over 5% of the vote and thus saw the return of their deposits, which were then priced at £500 each; 505 deposits were lost.
The party gained over 7% in four constituencies including John Aspinall in Folkestone and Hythe who received 8% of the vote. Much media attention was focused on the seat of Putney, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP David Mellor; Goldsmith secured 3.5% of the votes, losing his deposit, and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest in the south and east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of agricultural employment. Support for the party was considerably weaker in Inner London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish vote. This may have reflected greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party&#x27;s Euroscepticism was a form of English nationalism rather than British nationalism. The Referendum Party had proved more electorally successful than its Eurosceptic rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.

The general election resulted in a victory for Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour Party, which adopted a pro-EU stance. Labour&#x27;s victory was considered a landslide, thus making the Referendum Party&#x27;s role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832. Their representation in the House of Commons fell by over half, from 343 to 165; their lowest representation in the House since 1906. The reasons for their electoral decline were many and the impact of the Referendum Party was not a major factor.

The Referendum Party nevertheless may have cost the Conservatives certain seats. Many Conservatives themselves believed that this was the case. As noted by Anthony Heath, Roger Jowell, Bridget Taylor, and Katarina Thomson from their analysis of polling data, &quot;voters for the Referendum Party were certainly not a cross-section of the electorate. They were predominantly people who had voted Conservative (and, to a lesser extent, Liberal Democrat) in 1992. Hardly anyone who had voted Labour in 1992 supported Goldsmith&#x27;s party.&quot; Their evidence indicated that just under two-thirds of those who voted for the Referendum Party in 1997 had voted for the Conservatives in 1992, although the analysis also suggested that many of these people were dissatisfied with the Conservative government and would not have voted for them even had the Referendum Party not existed. Heath &quot;et al&quot; noted that &quot;voters for the Referendum Party were remarkably Eurosceptic but were unremarkable in most other respects. They show no sign of being right-wing on the economic issues of the left-right dimension and they were not consistently right-wing ideologues.&quot; Those who voted for the party held a diversity of ideological positions, the only shared factor being their Euroscepticism.

According to analysis by the political scientist John Curtice and psephologist Michael Steed, &quot;only a handful of the Conservatives&#x27; losses of seats can be blamed on the intervention of the Referendum Party&quot;. Their estimate was that only four seats would have been Conservative without the Referendum Party standing. For this reason, Butler and Kavanagh stated that the Referendum Party &quot;had only a limited effect on the Conservatives&#x27; fortunes&quot;. On employing aggregate constituency data, Ian McAllister and Donley T. Studlar disagreed, arguing that the Referendum Party had a greater impact on the Conservatives than previous research suggested. They argued that the Referendum Party cost the Conservatives an average of 3.4% of the vote. Their analysis further suggested that there were 16 seats where the involvement of the Referendum Party directly cost the Conservative candidate their victory, and a further three where it was a contributing factor to the Conservatives&#x27; failure.

==Dissolution and legacy==
Immediately after the election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been suffering from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing in the election would shorten his life. He died in Benahavis, Spain, on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly afterwards. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a pressure group closely associated with the former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic cause was weakened; with Blair&#x27;s firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the EU was considered as distant as it had been in 1995.

Under the direction of UKIP&#x27;s leader Michael Holmes, UKIP&#x27;s chairman Nigel Farage began recruiting former Referendum Party members to their own group; according to Farage, around 160 of the Referendum Party&#x27;s candidates joined UKIP. Among those who did so was Jeffrey Titford, who later became one of UKIP&#x27;s first MEPs. Other former members of the Referendum Party joined the Democratic Party, a small Eurosceptic group founded in 1998. In the 1999 Kensington and Chelsea by-election, one candidate stood under the banner of the now-defunct &quot;Referendum Party&quot;; they came eleventh, with 57 votes. In the 2001 general election, much of the support that had previously gone to the Referendum Party went not to UKIP but to the Conservatives, whose leader William Hague had employed Eurosceptic rhetoric throughout his campaign.

Rupert Lowe, one of the Referendum Party&#x27;s candidates in the 1997 general election, was elected as the Brexit Party&#x27;s lead candidate for the West Midlands constituency in the 2019 European Parliament elections and was later elected MP for Reform UK for the constituency of Great Yarmouth. James Glancy, another of the Brexit Party&#x27;s MEPs, has compared the Brexit Party to the Referendum Party, being a &quot;united and diverse group of people from different political backgrounds&quot;.

<text>Stranger Than Fiction is the eighth full-length studio album and major label debut by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released in 1994. It was a major breakthrough for Bad Religion, being certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and becoming the band&#x27;s first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at 87.

==Release==
&quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; was their first album released on the major label Atlantic Records (although that label re-released the previous album, &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot;). In the midst of touring, guitarist Brett Gurewitz left the band, citing personal conflicts in the band and a need to focus on Epitaph Records. Gurewitz&#x27;s role was filled by Brian Baker, formerly of Minor Threat.

With sales continuing years after its release, &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; is one of Bad Religion&#x27;s most successful albums, featuring two of their well-known hit singles, &quot;Infected&quot; (released on January 6, 1995) and the re-recorded version of &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot; (released September 1994), which first appeared on Against the Grain. Both songs earned airplay on MTV and radio stations, such as KROQ. The album included another hit single, &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; (released August 1994), though the last one, &quot;Incomplete&quot; (released May 1995), failed to make any national chart. The album also includes fan favorites, &quot;Leave Mine To Me&quot;, &quot;Tiny Voices&quot;, &quot;The Handshake&quot;, and &quot;Better Off Dead.&quot; As of today, &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; remains the only Bad Religion record to obtain gold status in the United States and Canada. The album was re-released by Epitaph Records on September 15, 2008.

In 2009, Rhino Records released a colored vinyl to coincide with this album&#x27;s 15th anniversary.

==Reception==
&quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; was released on September 6, 1994, and became the first Bad Religion album distributed via Atlantic Records. On September 24 of that year, the album peaked at number 87 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, and on March 4, 1998, also became Bad Religion&#x27;s first (and only) album to be certified gold in the United States.

AllMusic&#x27;s Jack Rabid praised this album as a &quot;rare case of selling out in reverse&quot; and songs such as &quot;Leave Mine to Me&quot;, &quot;Individual&quot;, &quot;Tiny Voices&quot; and &quot;Marked&quot;, calling them &quot;all uptempo barnburners, pulverizing in their rapid passion&quot;. He also criticizes &quot;&#x27;Infected&#x27; and &#x27;Television&#x27;&quot; as &quot;the two least effective songs of their 15 years, the former a third-rate &#x27;Sanity&#x27;&quot;, referring to the seventh track on 1989&#x27;s &quot;No Control&quot;. Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), wrote that &quot;while &quot;Recipe&quot; went for poppy, &quot;Fiction&quot; goes for polish,&quot; praising Wallace&#x27;s production.&quot; He added: &quot;Aggression and drama spar at mid-punk pace while the themes remain as acerbic as ever.&quot;

In November 2011, &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; was ranked number one on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1994, with The Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Smash&quot; in second place and Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Weezer&quot; in third place. Loudwire placed &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; at No. 9 on its &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994&quot; list. In July 2014, &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; was featured on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.
