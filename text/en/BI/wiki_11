<text>FL Studio (known as FruityLoops before 2003) is a digital audio workstation (DAW) developed by the Belgian company Image-Line. It features a graphical user interface with a pattern-based music sequencer. It is available in four different editions for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

After their initial purchase, lifetime updates of the software are free to registered users. Image-Line also develops FL Studio Mobile for Android, iOS, macOS, and Universal Windows Platform devices.

FL Studio can be used as either a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) or Audio Unit (AU) instrument in other audio workstation programs, and as a ReWire client. Image-Line offers its own VST and AU instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by many notable hip hop and EDM producers, including 9th Wonder, Cardo, Basshunter, Metro Boomin, Hit-Boy, Porter Robinson, Alan Walker, Madeon, Soulja Boy, Southside, Martin Garrix, Avicii, Imanbek, Lex Luger, and Deadmau5. The default tempo of FL Studio (130 BPM) has been credited as being the reason that this tempo is the middle point for most users(originally the tempo was set at 140 due to grime).

==History==
The first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released on December 18, 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel MIDI drum machine. Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program, and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex digital audio workstation.

Image-Line renamed FruityLoops to FL Studio in mid 2003, after the company&#x27;s attempt to obtain a US trademark prompted concerns from Kellogg&#x27;s. and to improve the software&#x27;s marketability. Software piracy was a major issue in the company&#x27;s early days, and it took nearly 5 years for the company to turn a profit from users purchasing legitimate licenses.

A macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released on May 22, 2018.

==Overview==

=== Editions ===
FL Studio comes in several editions with different levels of functionality. The free trial version includes all of the program&#x27;s features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to WAV, MIDI, MP3, FLAC and OGG. Projects saved while in demo mode, however, can only be opened once FL Studio and its plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments is cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.

==== Fruity Edition ====
The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, piano roll, and event automation features, which allow complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, and Logic. As of version 21.0.3, this edition includes 84 instruments and effects; it does not support audio recording and the use of audio clips.

==== Producer Edition ====
The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full audio recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows hand-drawing point and curve based splines (referred to as &quot;automation clips&quot;). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), Sytrus, Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.

==== Signature Bundle ====
This edition includes the Producer Edition plus a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video Player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat, and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.

==== All Plugins Edition ====
The All Plugins Edition includes the Signature Bundle and extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.

==== FL Studio Mobile ====
On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released FL Studio Mobile for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including iPod Touches, iPhones, iPads, Android 2.3.3, and higher smartphones and tablets.

==== Groove/GMM ====
Groove, a standalone Groovebox-style application optimized for touch-based music creation, was released for the Windows 8 store on September 2, 2013, as FL Studio Groove. It was later released on mobile devices as Groove Machine Mobile and temporarily available as a plugin in FL Studio. As of now, it is no longer available for purchase.

==== FL Cloud ====
FL Cloud is a sub-brand launched by Image Line on October 26, 2023, encompassing online products and services for music production, with tools for mastering, music distribution, and accessing a curated selection of audio samples. Its features include:

* Sounds: Similar to FL Studio FLEX, FL Cloud allows seamless integration of audio samples directly within FL Studio. Content can be downloaded directly into the FL Studio project, eliminating the need for external libraries or manual file management. There are free and subscription options. The subscription option provides access to a wider range of sounds compared to the free version. Alternatively users can purchase non-expiring Download Credits to access the same sample library as available while subscribed.

* Mastering: FL Cloud offers both free and paid options for professional-grade mastering. The free tier provides basic tools, while the paid subscription unlocks advanced features and additional mastering effects.

* Music Distribution: Included with the subscription offering, music distribution allows users to directly upload their music to major streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and more.

* External Plugins: FL Cloud now includes 65+ plugins from UVI, Native Instruments, Minimal Audio, Baby Audio, and more. 10 Plugins are available for free, and 20 with the Plus tier.

===System requirements===
FL Studio processes audio using an internal 32-bit floating point engine. It supports sampling rates up to 192 kHz using either WDM- or ASIO-enabled drivers. 

Windows 7/8/10/11 or later (32-bit or 64-bit versions), MacOS Version 10.13.6 (High Sierra) or later.

* Disk space: 4 GB
* RAM: 4 GB 

* CPU: Intel and Ryzen only, ARM not supported.

&quot;Note: More powerful CPU, more Instruments and Effects you can run.&quot;

===Program features===
*Version 9.0 introduced support for multi-core effects processing and improved support for multi-core instrument processing.
*Version 10.0, released on March 29, 2011, included a new project browser, fixed some bugs, and smoothed envelope points. It also introduced Patcher, a modular workflow environment capable of chaining together an unlimited number of instruments and effects.
*Version 11.0, released on April 19, 2013, included multi-touch support, improved tempo automation, new plugins such as BassDrum, GMS, Effector, Patcher, and new piano roll features (VFX Key Mapper, VFX Color Mapper).
*Version 12.0, released on April 22, 2015, added a new vectorial UI, updated plugins, multi-touch support, a redesigned mixer, improved 32 and 64 bit plugin support and improved file management.
*Version 20.0, released on May 22, 2018, skipped versions 13 to 19 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the program. It introduced native macOS support, multiple time-signatures, MIDI conversion to audio, unlimited playlist arrangements, improved plugin delay compensation, the return of the step sequencer graph editor, In-situ rendering (&quot;freezing&quot;), and other improvements.

The mixer interface allows for any number of channel configurations. This allows mixing in 2.1, 5.1, or 7.1 surround sound, as long as the output hardware interface has an equivalent number of outputs. The mixer also supports audio-in, enabling FL Studio to record multitrack audio.

FL Studio supports audio time stretching and pitch scaling, beat slicing, chopping, and editing of audio, and as of version 12.9 it can record up to 125 simultaneous audio tracks. Other key features include a digital piano roll. Audio can be imported or exported as WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, MIDI, ZIP, or the native project format with an .FLP filename extension.

The trial allows users to save projects, but does not allow reopening them. Tracks may be exported to any of the available file formats.

==Plug-ins==
FL Studio comes with a variety of plugins and generators (software synthesizers) written in the program&#x27;s own native plugin architecture. FL Studio also has support for third-party VST and DirectX plugins. The API has a built in wrapper for full VST, VST2, VST3, DX, and ReWire compatibility. There has also been support for the CLAP plugin format since FL Studio 2024.

Although FL Studio&#x27;s own plugins are set to be available only in their native format in the future, some of them also function independently as standalone programs and can be purchased in VST format for use with other DAWs.

===Virtual effects===
FL Studio is bundled with a variety of sound processing effects, including common audio effects such as chorus, compression, distortion, delay, flanger, phaser, reverb, gate, equalization, vocoding, maximization, and limiting.

===Synthesizers===

FL Studio&#x27;s install contains the entirety of native software synthesizers, internally labeled as &quot;generators&quot;. Depending on the edition of the program, some will be locked in trial mode until the synth itself or a software upgrade is purchased.

==== Harmor ====
Harmor is Image-Line&#x27;s flagship synthesizer. Initially released in late 2011 as a successor to Harmless, it was envisioned as a way to work with additive synthesis through an interface typical of subtractive synthesizers. It also includes many functions previously found within individual FL Studio utilities. such as the ability to produce sounds from pictures fed into the synth (known as &quot;image resynthesis&quot;).

==== Sytrus ====
Sytrus is an FM synthesizer with an internal effects module and additional wavetable capabilities. Its architecture can let it interface directly with patches from Yamaha DX7 units, allowing it to import original SYSEX data.

== Dedicated hardware ==
As with other DAW developers, Image-Line has collaborated with hardware manufacturers on two occasions, resulting in the release of products branded and compatible with FL Studio.

The first was the Akai &quot;FIRE&quot;, a MIDI controller with touch and pressure-sensitive buttons modelled after the software&#x27;s channel rack pattern editor. Released in 2018, it can be used as a pattern editor, keyboard, drumpad, multi-colour peak visualizer and performance controller. A distinctive feature of the Akai FIRE is that up to 4 units can be connected to a single instance of FL Studio, chained together or with a different mode set for each. It is sold in two variants, one coming without extra software (aimed at existing FL Studio users), and one bundled with an exclusive version of the &quot;Fruity&quot; edition called the &quot;Fruity Fire Edition&quot;.

The latter of these involvements is currently the Novation &quot;FL Key&quot; line of controllers. It consists of two redesigned MIDI Keyboards – dubbed the &quot;FL Key Mini&quot; and the &quot;FL Key 37&quot;, the latter being larger in keybed and size – originally from Novation&#x27;s own Launchkey line, modified to have a grey case and an FL Studio-themed RGB lighting palette. They later released the &quot;FL Key 61&quot;, a larger version with the same features.

Despite some initial traction regarding the Akai &quot;FIRE&quot;&#x27;s unusual velocity implementation, both units have gone on to receive broadly positive reception from the professional press.

==Reception==
FL Studio has been praised for its simplicity, power, and ease of use. Jamie Lendino of &quot;PCMag&quot; wrote that &quot;While [FL Studio is] still clearly geared for electronic music production &#x27;in the box,&#x27; as opposed to recording live musicians playing acoustic instruments, you can record or create just about any kind of audio project with it.&quot; Criticisms include a difficult audio recording system.

<text>Lamprolepis is a genus of lizards, known commonly as emerald skinks, in the subfamily Lygosominae of the family Scincidae. &quot;Lygosoma&quot; is its closest genetic relative.

==Geographic range==
Species of the genus &quot;Lamprolepis&quot; are found in Indonesia and Malaysia, and on islands in the western Pacific.

==Species==
Today, three species are recognized as being valid.

The two Phantom Skink species, Tristiidon Lunata and Tristiidon Sol Were once classed here, but now has its own Genus.
&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Lamprolepis&quot;.

<doc id="341221" wikidata="Q781401" url="?curid=341221" title="Australian Federal Police">
<text>The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is the principal federal law enforcement agency of the Australian Government with the unique role of investigating crime and protecting the national security of the Commonwealth of Australia. The AFP is an independent agency of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department and is responsible to the Attorney-General and accountable to the Parliament of Australia. the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is Reece Kershaw, formerly the Northern Territory Police Commissioner.

The AFP has a focus on preventing, investigating and disrupting transnational, serious, complex and organised crime including terrorism and violent extremism, cybercrime, child exploitation, drug smuggling, and human trafficking. The AFP is also responsible for delivering community policing in the Australian Capital Territory through ACT Policing and to other dependent territories, providing protective security in major airports and close protection for dignitaries including the prime minister of Australia and foreign diplomatic missions, delivering law enforcement training for Asia-Pacific partner agencies, acting as Australia&#x27;s international law enforcement and policing representative, and contributing to United Nations peacekeeping around the world. The AFP is also a member of the National Intelligence Community and works closely with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Border Force, and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.

==History==
The Australian Federal Police was formed on 19 October 1979 under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 after the merging of the former Commonwealth Police and the Australian Capital Territory Police. This followed a review of Australia&#x27;s anti-terrorism capacity by Sir Robert Mark, former commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in the UK, which was commissioned by the Fraser government following the 1978 Hilton bombing. In November 1979, the Federal Narcotics Bureau was transferred to the new agency. In 1984 the protective service component of the AFP was separated forming the Australian Protective Service under the administrative service and later governed by Attorney-General&#x27;s Department; that agency was transferred back to the AFP in 2004 and is now known as Australian Federal Police Specialist Protective Command or as &quot;Uniform Protection&quot; internally.

==Oversight==
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, a joint committee of members of the Australian House and Senate, has responsibility for oversight of the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission.

Separately, the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) is charged with investigating systemic corruption in the AFP and other commonwealth agencies.

==Roles and functions==
The AFP&#x27;s role is to enforce Australian criminal law, contribute to combating complex, transnational, serious and organised crime impacting Australia&#x27;s national security and to protect Commonwealth interests from criminal activity in Australia and overseas.

The AFP is responsible to The Attorney-General&#x27;s Department. Key priorities of the AFP are set by the Attorney-General, through a &quot;ministerial direction&quot; issued under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. Areas of operational emphasis include:

*investigating complex, transnational, serious and organised crime
*protecting Australians and Australian interests from terrorism and violent extremism
*representing Australian police and law enforcement on an international level
*developing unique capabilities and exploiting advanced technology to support Australia&#x27;s national interests.

Continued responsibilities include providing:
*community policing services under contracted arrangement, to the Australian Capital Territory and territories of Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk Island and Jervis Bay Territory.
*a national protection capability to ensure the protection of specific individuals, establishments and events identified by the Australian Government as being at risk.
*a national counter-terrorism first response capability focused on aviation security and protection of critical infrastructure.

===National Operations===
Federal agents are based in each Australian state and territory, internationally and form the largest component of the AFP staff, federal agents chiefly perform criminal investigative duties.

Current areas of focus for the AFP:
* Illicit drug trafficking
* People smuggling;
* Human trafficking, including slavery and human exploitation;
* Serious major fraud against the government
* High-tech crime involving information technology and communications
* Prevention, countering and investigation of terrorism
* Transnational and multi-jurisdictional crime
* Money laundering
* Organised crime
* Cyber crime

The AFP hosts a National Missing Persons Coordination Unit and the Australian Interpol National Central Bureau.

===In Australian Capital Territory and other territories===
In addition to its federal role, the AFP provides policing services to the Australian Capital Territory and the external territories, including Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk Island, and Jervis Bay Territory.

===Specialist Protective Command===

The AFP Specialist Protective Command provides physical protection for the Australian government at key locations throughout Australia and internationally. Uniform protection officers (identified as Protective Service Officers or PSOs) are firearms and defensive tactics trained, and perform duties which include armed escorts, bomb appraisals, bomb detection canines, visitor control, static guarding, alarm monitoring and response, mobile, foot and bicycle patrols, maintain civil order, security consultancy services, counter-terrorism first response at many Commonwealth establishments. Protective Service Officers have powers under Section 14 of the AFP Act 1979 to stop, request identification, search and arrest within their jurisdiction. Uniform protection officers undertake an essential role in protecting Australia&#x27;s critical infrastructure and assist in providing protection for Australian high office holders, diplomatic, consular personnel and other foreign nationals.

Specialist Protective Command officers providing an armed uniform capability are located at federal establishments including Parliament House in Canberra; the residences of the prime minister and governor-general; foreign embassies and consulates in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth; the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, joint defence facilities such as the Australian Defence Force Headquarters in Canberra, Holsworthy Barracks, Garden Island Naval Base, Victoria Barracks, the Pine Gap US defence installation, and sensitive covert locations in Australia and internationally.

Aviation Uniform Police (AUP) are the primary law enforcement agency responsible for aviation security at the nine major Australian airports; Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Cairns, Gold Coast and Perth. On 6 December 2019 the AFP announced that the Protective Operations Response Team (PORT) members located at the nine designated Australian airports will carry the Daniel Defense Mk.18 Short Barreled Rifle. The increase in AFP aviation protection capability was part of the Aviation Security Enhancement Program (ASEP), the short barreled firearms specifically for the purpose of delivering a Counter Terrorist First Response (CTFR) role.

===International peacekeeping===
Since its inception, the AFP has had a long tradition of involvement in international peacekeeping, policing and capacity development. International Deployment Group (IDG) is an AFP portfolio that has increased rapidly in a short time since its inception in 2004. Since 1964, Australia has contributed police officers to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. AFP officers have also previously served with the United Nations in East Timor (Timor-Leste) and South Sudan.

In recent years, Australian government efforts to assist neighbouring and remote countries with institutional capacity building has led to AFP deployments to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands (Under the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands), Timor-Leste (Under the Timor-Leste Police Development Program TLPDP), Nauru, Tonga, Vanuatu, Afghanistan, Samoa and Vanuatu. Previous peacekeeping missions have included Haiti, Mozambique, Thailand, Namibia, and Somalia.

IDG uses the Specialist Response Group for particular medium and high risk planned operations or emergency incidents in addition to assisting with capacity building and force protection operations.

===Ceremonial and protocol===

The AFP Ceremonial and Protocol Team conducts and participates in a variety of police and community functions and ceremonies.

Ceremonial events include the annual National Police Remembrance Day Service at the National Police Memorial in Canberra on 29 September, medal presentations, parades, police funerals, memorial services, official opening of police stations and policing facilities, AFP pipes and drums concerts, inauguration events and public relations events. The Ceremonial Team coordinates the AFP Ceremonial and Protocol Officer (CAPO) Network and the AFP Pipes and Drums to perform ceremonial duties at these functions and ceremonies.

Formerly the Ceremonial team also included the AFP Ceremonial Mounted Cadre. The AFP Ceremonial Mounted Cadre was raised on 29 September 2006 at the dedication of the National Police Memorial. The ceremonial uniform comprises linkages to former mounted policing units of the AFP&#x27;s predecessor organisations, namely the Commonwealth Police and the Peace Officer guard, as well as mounted policing units from the NSW Police Force which patrolled the geographic area of the ACT. The Mounted Cadre was disbanded shortly after their final appearance at the opening of the AFP&#x27;s new Headquarters in Barton on 7 April 2011.

The AFP Ceremonial and Protocol team currently provide drill instructor accreditation for both the AFP and the NSW Police Force, and ceremonial and protocol officer accreditation for all of Australia&#x27;s policing jurisdictions.

===International liaison===
The AFP has an international network to assist with inquiries and liaison with police agencies around the world. The AFP represents Australian state/territory police agencies internationally. AFP&#x27;s International Liaison Officer Network has 85 AFP appointees in 30 countries around the world. AFP International Liaison Officers are the Australian Government&#x27;s law enforcement representatives overseas.

==Structure==

===Joint Counter-Terrorism Teams===
The Joint Counter Terrorism Teams (JCTTs) in each state and territory jurisdiction consist of AFP, state and territory police, and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation officers. JCTTs conduct investigations to prevent and disrupt terrorism and violent extremism. The JCTT model can be seen as the Australian version of the United States&#x27; Joint Terrorism Task Force, Canada&#x27;s Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams and the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Counter Terrorism Policing Network.

The National Disruption Group (NDG) is an AFP-led interagency team which consolidates the capabilities of participating agencies to prevent, disrupt and prosecute Australian nationals who travel or intend to travel offshore to engage in hostilities and/or undertake terrorism training and support to terrorist entities. The NDG brings together the AFP and its partner agencies to coordinate operational disruption activities nationally and internationally with the aim of countering the enduring threat posed by foreign fighters.

===Australian Federal Police College===
The Australian Federal Police College in Barton, A.C.T. is the training facility for the force.

==Commissioners==
The highest ranked AFP officer is the commissioner, appointed under Section 17 of the &quot;Australian Federal Police Act 1979&quot;.

== Ranks ==

AFP members performing duties in ACT Policing, External Territories, Aviation, International Deployment Group (mission component) use uniform and community policing ranks. All other members use the title Federal Agent. Where applicable qualified members are also entitled to use Detective designation.

AFP Commissioner&#x27;s Order 1 (Administration) states that every AFP Member holds a rank (as detailed below), with the corresponding title and role adopted.

First Class Constable is a reflection of four years of service. Senior Constable is a minimum of six years service. Leading Senior Constable is a reflection of at least 12–15 years of service. From there, promotion to Sergeant etc. is by application/merit and so on.

==Criticism==

=== Haneef affair ===
On 2 July 2007, Muhamed Haneef was arrested and held by the AFP and Border officers for terror-related incidents, as he was leaving the country. It was the longest detention without charge under recent anti-terror laws and was found to be unjustified. He received an apology and compensation after this.

=== Martens conviction ===
In October 2006 a Cairns jury convicted pilot Frederic Arthur Martens under sex tourism laws of having intercourse with a 14-year-old girl in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. However, Martens was not in Port Moresby at the time, and flight records could prove this. The AFP refused to retrieve those records despite numerous requests, and Martins could not retrieve them as he was in jail. When the records were eventually retrieved by Martens&#x27; partner the convictions were quashed, with strong criticism of the AFP by Justice Chesterman. The AFP also froze all of Marten&#x27;s funds while he was in custody, which prevented treatment for his daughter in Port Moresby, who died as a result.

=== Bali Nine ===
The AFP were contacted by a member of the Bali Nine drug courier gang&#x27;s father, and they said they would keep a watch on him. They could not stop them travelling to Indonesia to smuggle drugs. Instead, they contacted the Indonesian police which led to their arrest in Indonesia rather than when returning to Australia. The leaders of the gang, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed on 29 April 2015. The others were released from prison after 19 years and returned to Australia in December 2024.

=== Harun Causevic ===

Over 200 heavily armed police conducted raids at 3:00 am at various houses in Victoria on 19 April 2015, and then held Harun Causevic on a Preventative Detention Order (PDO), before charging him with terrorist offences. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said this was the first time a PDO had been used, and validated their importance.

However, after Causevic spent three months in jail awaiting trial the federal police decided to drop the terrorism charges. Causevic&#x27;s defence lawyer, Rob Stary, said there was never any real evidence against Causevic, and that this eroded confidence in the authorities. He was also critical of the earlier &quot;grandstanding&quot; of Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Premier Daniel Andrews.

=== Raids on media ===

On 4 June 2019 the AFP conducted a raid on the home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst, looking for information connected to a story she had written a few years earlier about new laws that would give the security forces new powers for surveillance over Australian citizens. Radio host Ben Fordham also claimed that he was under investigation for some of his reporting.

The next day the police raided the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) over a story about alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The search warrant allowed the police to &quot;add, copy, delete or alter&quot; any files they found on the computers.

The incidents caused an outcry of condemnation from international media outlets, including the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. However, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that &quot;it never troubles me that our laws are being upheld&quot;. The AFP have not ruled out the possibility that reporters may also be charged in relation to the alleged offences being investigated.

On 15 April 2020, the High Court of Australia ruled that the warrant used in the Smethurst raid was invalid.

=== Lehrmann rape trial ===
The Australian Federal Police withheld evidence provided by ACT Policing investigators to ACT prosecutors in 2021 Australian Parliament House sexual misconduct allegations to an inquiry into the handling of the matter due to laws preventing the agency from disclosing certain information. This led to accusations the agency was refusing to hand over the evidence. The inquiry was created in the wake of accusations of mishandling made by both the ACT&#x27;s Director of Public Prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, and the Australian Federal Police against each other.

=== Member&#x27;s conditions ===
The AFP changed rules around how firearms are checked out after a series of suicides in their offices, these changes were criticised by the Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA) as a quick fix. The AFP has been criticised for low salaries, with accusations of having some of the lowest salaries of any police agency in Australia and some members being forced to find further employment. The AFPA has claimed that the AFP had become the lowest paid law enforcement agency in Australia and is losing dozens of officers to other agencies each month.

=== Operation Bourglinster ===
The AFP was criticised for an operation in which it targeted a young boy with autism spectrum disorder who had developed a fixation on a terrorist organisation. The boy&#x27;s parent reported their concerns to authorities, leading to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Victoria Police, and AFP joint counter-terrorism team (JCTT) to begin Operation Bourglinster. Officers of the JCTT were accused of encouraging the boy&#x27;s ideation with terrorism, leading to a Victorian court to impose a permanent stay on charges.

== Media portrayal ==
The AFP has appeared in several fictional television series and documentaries. The AFP was the focus of a documentary series called &quot;AFP&quot;, which followed AFP operations and training in Australia and internationally. AFP members have also appeared in other documentary series such as &quot;Border Security: Australia&#x27;s Front Line&quot; and the &quot;Keeping Australia Safe&quot; miniseries.

The AFP is portrayed in the true crime-drama series &quot;Underbelly&quot; and is also portrayed in the military action series &quot;&quot; along with the United States Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).

<text>Leiolopisma is a genus of skinks. Most species occur in the region of New Caledonia-New Zealand, and they are related to other genera from that general area, such as &quot;Emoia&quot;; these and others form the &quot;Eugongylus&quot; group. One living and two extinct taxa represent a clade endemic to the Mascarenes.(Austin &amp; Arnold 2006)

Example species
*&quot;Leiolopisma alazon&quot; - Lauan ground skink, Ono-i-Lau ground skink
*&quot;Leiolopisma ceciliae&quot; - extinct - Réunion giant skink
*&quot;Leiolopisma mauritiana&quot; - extinct - Mauritian giant skink
*&quot;Leiolopisma telfairii&quot; - Round Island ground skink

The Mauritian giant skink (&quot;Leiolopisma mauritiana&quot;) and the Réunion giant skink (&quot;Leiolopisma ceciliae&quot;) were closely related. These two were formerly separated in &quot;Didosaurus&quot;. David Day (1979), in Vanished Species, described the Reunion giant skink as small and fast moving but completely unafraid of humans. Individuals would climb on observer&#x27;s legs. Efforts to maintain the species in captivity proved futile. The Reunion giant skink was reported to be completely insectivorous.

<text>Lerista is a diverse (~ 90 species) genus of skinks endemic to Australia, commonly known as sliders.

==Description==
The genus is especially notable for the variation in the amount of limb reduction. The variation ranges from short-bodied forms with large legs bearing five toes, to elongate forms completely lacking legs. The body length of the lizards is . Their locomotion is linked to their body shape. The shorter skinks with prominent limbs travel on the surface; the longer skinks with reduced legs tend to burrow more. A phylogenetic tree of &quot;Lerista&quot;, derived from DNA analysis, reveals that limb loss has happened multiple times within this group. Limb loss has occurred relatively recently, in the past 3.6 million years or so.

<text>Lygosoma is a genus of lizards, commonly known as supple skinks or writhing skinks, which are members of the family Scincidae. &quot;Lygosoma&quot; is the type genus of the subfamily Lygosominae. The common name, writhing skinks, refers to the way these stubby-legged animals move, snake-like but more slowly and more awkwardly.

==Geographic range==
Species of &quot;Lygosoma&quot; are found in India to southeast Asia.

== Taxonomy ==
In the late 19th and early 20th century, &quot;Lygosoma&quot; was used as a &quot;wastebin taxon&quot;, to which almost every newly described skink was assigned.

Which specific species are contained within this genus is controversial because of its unresolved historic relation to two other closely related genera: &quot;Mochlus&quot; and &quot;Lepidothyris.&quot; Currently, there are 16 known species in &quot;Lygosoma&quot;, 15 known species in &quot;Mochlus&quot;, and three known species in &quot;Lepidothyris&quot;. However, some species under the latter two genera are often listed under &quot;Lygosoma&quot;, and &quot;Lygosoma&quot; was recently found to be paraphyletic to the other two genera based on phylogenetic studies. To clear up this confusion, all species (49) pertaining to these three genera are classified as &quot;Lygosoma s.l.&quot; and the known 16 species under &quot;Lygosoma&quot; are classified as &quot;Lygosoma s.s.&quot;&quot;

After performing extensive phylogenetic analyses (genetic and molecular, species tree, and morphological anaylses), the classification of &quot;Lygosoma s.l.&quot; was further revised to containing four genera: &quot;Lygosoma&quot; (Southeast Asian writhing skinks), &quot;Mochlus&quot; (African supple skinks), &quot;Riopa&quot; (Asian gracile skinks), and &quot;Subdoluseps gen. nov.&quot; (Asian agile skinks). Genus &quot;Lygosoma s.s.&quot; was found to be separated into three clades instead of being a monophyletic group in relation to other genera within &quot;Lygosoma s.l.&quot;, which in turn renamed this genus to &quot;Lygosoma&quot; and contains species that have &quot;Lygosoma quadrupes&quot; as their common ancestor. &quot;Mochlus&quot; was also found to be paraphyletic to &quot;Lepidothyris&quot;, making it not a monophyletic group and ultimately grouping genera &quot;Mochlus&quot; and &quot;Lepidothyris&quot; as one genus, &quot;Mochlus&quot;. &quot;Riopa&quot; was a recently discovered genus from about 11 years ago and was supported as a monophyletic group within &quot;Lygosoma s.l.&quot;, and &quot;Subdoluseps gen. nov.&quot; is also a newly added genus to this group.

==Species==
The following species are recognized.

*&quot;Lygosoma angeli&quot; – Angel&#x27;s writhing skink
*&quot;Lygosoma bampfyldei&quot; – Bampfylde&#x27;s supple skink, Bampfylde&#x27;s writhing skink
*&quot;Lygosoma boehmei&quot; 
*&quot;Lygosoma corpulentum&quot; – fat skink 
*&quot;Lygosoma haroldyoungi&quot; – banded supple skink, Harold&#x27;s writhing skink, Harold Young&#x27;s supple skink
*&quot;Lygosoma isodactylum&quot; – Siamese writhing skink, even-toed supple skink 
*&quot;Lygosoma kinabatanganense&quot; – Kinabatangan supple skink 
*&quot;Lygosoma koratense&quot; – Korat supple skink, Koraten writhing skink
*&quot;Lygosoma opisthorhodum&quot; 
*&quot;Lygosoma peninsulare&quot; 
*&quot;Lygosoma quadrupes&quot; – short-limbed supple skink, Linnaeus&#x27;s writhing skink
*&quot;Lygosoma schneideri&quot; – Sumatran supple skink
*&quot;Lygosoma siamense&quot; – Siamese supple skink
*&quot;Lygosoma singha&quot; 
*&quot;Lygosoma tabonorum&quot; – Palawan supple skink
*&quot;Lygosoma veunsaiense&quot; 

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Lygosoma&quot;.

<text>Mabuya is a genus of long-tailed skinks, lizards in the family Scincidae. The genus is restricted to species from various Caribbean islands. Out of 26 recognized species, six species are only found in Caribbean islands. Species in the genus &quot;Mabuya&quot; are primarily carnivorous, though many are omnivorous. The genus is viviparous, having a highly evolved placenta that resembles that of eutherian mammals. Formerly, many Old World species were placed here, as &quot;Mabuya&quot; was a kind of &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;. These Old World species are now placed in the genera &quot;Chioninia&quot;, &quot;Eutropis&quot;, and &quot;Trachylepis&quot;. Under the older classification, the New World species were referred to as &quot;American mabuyas&quot;, and as of 2024 include the genera &quot;Alinea&quot;, &quot;Aspronema&quot;, &quot;Brasiliscincus&quot;, &quot;Capitellum&quot;, &quot;Copeoglossum&quot;, &quot;Maracaiba&quot;, &quot;Marisora&quot;, and &quot;Varzea&quot;.

Most species in this genus are feared to be possibly extinct due to introduced predators.

==Species==
Listed alphabetically by specific name.
*&quot;Mabuya cochonae&quot; – Cochons skink (possibly extinct)
*&quot;Mabuya desiradae&quot; – Désirade skink 
*&quot;Mabuya dominicana&quot; – Dominica skink
*&quot;Mabuya grandisterrae&quot; – Grande-Terre skink (possibly extinct)
*&quot;Mabuya guadeloupae&quot; – Guadeloupe skink (possibly extinct)
*&quot;Mabuya hispaniolae&quot; – Hispaniolan two-lined skink (possibly extinct)
*&quot;Mabuya mabouya&quot; – Greater Martinique skink (possibly extinct)
*&quot;Mabuya montserratae&quot; – Montserrat skink (possibly extinct)
*&quot;Mabuya parviterrae&quot; – Petite Terre skink

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Mabuya&quot;.

<text>Damião de Góis (; February 2, 1502January 30, 1574), born in Alenquer, Portugal, was an important Portuguese humanist philosopher. He was a friend and student of Erasmus. He was appointed secretary to the Portuguese factory in Antwerp in 1523 by King John III of Portugal. He compiled one of the first accounts on Ethiopian Christianity.

==Biography==
Góis (originally spelled as &quot;Goes&quot;) was born in Alenquer, Portugal, into a noble family who served the Portuguese kings. His father, Rui Dias de Góis was a valet to Duke of Aveiro, and his mother was Isabel Gomes de Limi, a descendant of Flemish merchants who established themselves in Portugal. Damião&#x27;s patrilineal great-grandfather, Gomes Dias de Góis, had been in the entourage of Prince Henry the Navigator. 

Around 1518, Góis joined the court of King Manuel I of Portugal. Under Manuel I’s successor, King John III of Portugal, in 1523, he was sent to Antwerp, as secretary and treasurer of the Portuguese &quot;feitoria&quot; (factory, trading post and commercial office). Henceforth, Góis travelled intensely (Poland, Lithuania, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, France, England, Italy), entering into contact with a number of important figures, like Sebastian Münster, Erasmus (who hosted him in Freiburg), Giovanni Battista Ramusio, Philipp Melanchthon, Thomas More and Martin Luther. Among the many Portuguese acquaintances, Góis was friend of the writers João de Barros and André de Resende. A humanist and an open mind, Góis followed courses at the Universities of Padua and Leuven, wrote on various topics, like the condition of the Sami people (&quot;Lapps&quot;), and translated some classic works – among them, Cicero’s Cato maior de senectute – into Portuguese. 

He was also a composer of some musical pieces and kept a private collection of paintings, including three by Hieronymous Bosch.

In the early 1530s, Góis met and later boarded with Erasmus in Freiburg for several months, giving him opportunity to write and converse.

Góis translated into Latin a Portuguese opuscle on the Ethiopian embassy of the Armenian Mateus (the representative of the Negus Dawit II) to Portugal (1532), which also included the famous &quot;Letter of Prester John&quot; written by the Ethiopian Queen Eleni (1509) and a &quot;Confessio illorum fidei&quot;.

In 1538 he published a translation of the Biblical book Ecclesiastes in Portuguese, though it was not widely circulated. In the same year, he took a Dutch wife, Joana van Hargen (known as Joana de Argem in Portugal), daughter of a Flemish councilman to the Court of Carlos V. In 1540, he published the famous &quot;Fides, religio, moresque Aethiopum&quot; (&quot;Ethiopian faith, religion, and mores&quot;). The book received a widespread diffusion in Europe, in both Catholic and Protestant circles, and enjoyed of successive editions (Paris 1541, Leuven 1544, Leiden 1561, Cologne 1574). 
It also earned the author, however, the criticisms of the powerful Portuguese Cardinal Henry of Portugal, who, as Grand Inquisitor of the Portuguese Inquisition, banned its circulation in the kingdom. The Jesuit order proved equally critical, as he was accused by the Provincial superior Simão Rodrigues of Lutheranism, and of being a disciple of Erasmus, before the Inquisition.

He was settled at Louvain, then the literary centre of the Low Countries, when the French besieged the town in 1542. He was given the command of the defending forces, and saved Louvain, but was taken prisoner and confined for nine months in France, till he obtained his freedom by a heavy ransom. He was rewarded, however, by a grant of arms from Charles V. He finally returned to Portugal in 1545, with a view of becoming tutor to the king&#x27;s son, but he failed to obtain this post, owing to the accusations before the Inquisition.

In 1548, Góis was named &quot;Guarda-Mor&quot; (High Guardian) of the Torre do Tombo (Royal Archives) and ten years later was entrusted by the same Cardinal Henry to write the chronicle of Manuel I’s reign. The task has been previously confided to de Barros, but relinquished by him. The work was completed in some seven years and became his major achievement; nonetheless it was widely attacked and parts of it were significantly censored. He also published a description of the city of Lisbon – &quot;Urbis Olisiponis Descriptio&quot; (1554).

In 1570 the inquisitorial process opened again, sending Góis to reclusion in the monastery of Batalha. He died shortly after in Alenquer under mysterious circumstances (apparently, murder), free but sick, and was buried in the church of Nossa Senhora da Várzea. Góis had several children: Manuel in 1540, Ambrósio in 1541, Rui Dias de Góis, António de Góis, Catarina de Góis, and Maria de Góis.

<doc id="341254" wikidata="Q667022" url="?curid=341254" title="Overtime">
<text>Overtime is the amount of time someone works beyond normal working hours. The term is also used for the pay received for this time. Normal hours may be determined in several ways:
*by custom (what is considered healthy or reasonable by society),
*by practices of a given trade or profession,
*by legislation,
*by agreement between employers and workers or their representatives.

Most national countries have overtime labour laws designed to dissuade or prevent employers from forcing their employees to work excessively long hours (such as the situation in the textile mills in the 1920s). These laws may take into account other considerations than humanitarian concerns, such as preserving the health of workers so that they may continue to be productive, or increasing the overall level of employment in the economy. One common approach to regulating overtime is to require employers to pay workers at a higher hourly rate for overtime work. Companies may choose to pay workers higher overtime pay even if not obliged to do so by law, particularly if they believe that they face a backward bending supply curve of labour.

Overtime pay rates can cause workers to work longer hours than they would at a flat hourly rate. Overtime laws, attitudes toward overtime and hours of work vary greatly from country to country and between various sectors.

==Time off in lieu==
&quot;Time off in lieu&quot; (TOIL), &quot;compensatory time&quot;, or &quot;comp time&quot; is a type of work schedule arrangement that allows (or requires) workers to take time off instead of, or in addition to, receiving overtime pay. A worker may receive overtime pay plus equal time off for each hour worked on certain agreed days, such as public holidays.

In the United States, such arrangements are currently legal in the public sector but not in the private sector.

For example, non-exempt workers must receive at least one and one half times their normal hourly wage for every hour worked beyond 40 hours in a work week. For example, workers who clock 48 hours in one week would receive the pay equivalent to 52 hours of work (40 hours + 8 hours at 1.5 times the normal hourly wage). With comp time, the worker could (or would have to) forgo the 12 hours of overtime pay and instead take 8 paid hours off at some future date.

In some other jurisdictions, such as Canada, employers might be required to pay the overtime at the higher rate (e.g. 1.5 times the normal rate), but also be allowed to require time off in lieu at the normal rate. Thus, an employee might work 48 hours in one week, and 32 hours the next week (assuming over 40 hours is overtime), and be paid an extra amount equivalent to 4 hours work (8 multiplied by 0.5).

In Australia, such arrangements both in the private and public sector are common.

In some cases, particularly when employees are represented by a labour union, overtime may be paid at a higher rate than 1.5 times the hourly pay. In some factories, for example, if workers are required to work on a Sunday, they may be paid twice their regular rate (i.e., &quot;double time&quot;).

==Overtime laws by jurisdiction==

===European Union===
Directives issued by the European Union must be incorporated into law by member states.

Directives 93/104/EC (1993), 2000/34/EC (2000), which limited working hours, were consolidated into 2003/88/EC (2003). Employers and employees can agree to opt out, under certain circumstances.

The directives require:
* maximum average working week (including overtime) of 48 hours over a 17-week reference period
* minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours in every 24
* breaks when the working day exceeds 6 hours
* minimum weekly rest period of 24 hours plus the 11 hours daily rest period in every 7-day period
* minimum of 4 weeks paid annual leave
* night work restricted to an average of 8 hours in any 24-hour period

The directives apply to:
*all sectors of activity, both public and private
*Doctors in training used to work a maximum week of 58 hours until 2009. From 1 August 2009 their maximum working week fell to 48 hours.

Exemptions:
* Member States of the EC may exempt: managing executives or other persons with autonomous decision-making power; family workers; and workers officiating at religious ceremonies. These are workers whose working time is not measured or pre-determined or can be determined by the workers.
* Other categories can be exempted from the directive&#x27;s key provisions provided compensatory rest or appropriate protection is granted. These include employees who work a long way from home, or whose activities require a permanent presence or continuity of service or production, or who work in sectors which have peaks of activity. Examples include off-shore workers, security guards, journalists, emergency workers, agricultural workers, tour guides, etc.

===Japan===

In Japan the of 1947 provides for an eight-hour work day and 40-hour workweek with at least one day off per week. The act requires a premium of at least 25% over the ordinary hourly wage for any overtime work, 35% for any work on prescribed off days, and an additional 25% for any work between 10 pm and 5 am. Employers must enter into an overtime agreement with a labour representative prior to any overtime work by employees, and this agreement must stipulate to the maximum number of overtime hours that an employee may work, which may be no more than 15 hours per week, 45 hours per month and 360 hours per year.

===United States===

====Federal overtime law====
In the United States the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 applies to employees in industries engaged in or producing goods for interstate commerce. The FLSA establishes a standard work week of 40 hours for certain kinds of workers, and mandates payment for overtime hours to those workers of one and one-half times the workers&#x27; normal rate of pay for any time worked above 40 hours.

The law creates two broad categories of employees, 
* those who are &quot;exempt&quot; from the regulation and 
* those who are &quot;non-exempt&quot;.

Employers are not required to pay exempt employees overtime but must do so for non-exempt employees.

=====Law Enforcement Availability Pay=====
Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP) is a type of premium pay that is paid to federal law enforcement officers who are classified as GS-1811 or FP-2501, criminal investigator or special agent. Due to the nature of their work, criminal investigators are required to work, or be available to work, substantial amounts of &quot;unscheduled duty.&quot; Availability pay is generally an entitlement that an agency must provide if the required conditions are met, but is optional in any agency&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General that may employ fewer than five criminal investigators.

The following agencies are covered under LEAP:

* Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)
* Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)
* Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
* Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS)
* Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG)
* Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
* Diplomatic Security Service (DSS)
* Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
* Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS)
* General Services Administration, Office of Inspector General (GSA-OIG)
* Homeland Security Investigations, part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE-HSI)
* IRS Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI)
* Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS)
* United States Marshals Service (USMS)
* United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS)
* United States Secret Service (USSS)
====Exempt====
Independent contractors are not considered employees and therefore are not protected by the FLSA. Several factors determine whether a worker is an employee, who might be entitled to overtime compensation, or an independent contractor, who would not be so entitled. The employment agreement stating that a party is an independent contractor does not make it necessarily so. The nature of a job determines whether an employee is entitled to overtime pay, not employment status or the field of work.

Classes of workers who are exempt from the regulation include certain types of administrative, professional, and executive employees. To qualify as an administrative, professional, or executive employee and therefore not be entitled to overtime, three tests must be passed based on salary basis, duties, and salary level. There are many other classes of workers who may be exempt including outside salespeople, certain agricultural employees, certain live-in employees, and certain transportation employees. Employees can neither waive their FLSA protections nor abridge them by contract.

====Protections====
An employer may not retaliate against an employee for filing a complaint or instituting a proceeding based on the FLSA. An employer that engages in any form of verifiable retaliation would be liable under the Fair Labor Standards Act Section 216(b) for equitable relief including reinstatement, promotion, payment of lost wages, and payment of liquidated damages. Acts of retaliation include terminating employment, disrupting the workplace, threats, acts of physical violence, and constructive discharge.

====Statistics====
Out of approximately 120 million American workers, nearly 50 million are exempt from overtime laws (US Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, 1998). As of 2021, salaried workers making $684 per week or more are exempt from overtime pay (equivalent to $35,568 per year). In 2004, the United States was 7th out of 24 OECD countries in terms of annual working hours per worker. (See Working time for a complete listing.) 

On August 23, 2004, President George W. Bush and the Department of Labor proposed changes to regulations governing implementation of the law. According to one study, the changes would have had significant impact on the number of workers covered by overtime laws and have exempted several million additional workers. The Bush administration maintained that the practical impact on working Americans would be minimal and that the changes would help clarify an outdated regulation. In particular, the new rules would have allowed more companies to offer flextime to their workers instead of overtime. The definition of &quot;exempt employees&quot; (ineligible for overtime) is regularly tested in the courts. A recent case is Encino Motorcars v. Navarro, which addresses the question of whether automobile dealer service advisors are eligible for overtime.

A company may harm themselves by docking a salaried employee for disciplinary reasons.
::&quot;Once pay is reduced using an hourly calculation, ... the employee is considered nonexempt, and so is every other worker in that job group.&quot;

Uber is an example of a company that, in various jurisdictions, has been subject to litigation regarding exemptions. The New York Times noted in 2017 that &quot;Despite their appeal, the apps have faced a wave of criticism, including concerns over wheelchair accessibility and driver pay.&quot;

====California overtime law====
The state of California&#x27;s overtime laws differ from federal overtime laws in many respects, and they involve overlapping statutes, regulations, and precedents that govern the compensation of employees in California. 
* Governing federal law is the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 USC 201–219)
* California overtime law is codified in provisions of:
:*the California Labor Code and in
:*Wage orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission
California employers must comply with both, since there are two sources of applicable law (federal and state).

In California, based on California Labor Code 1171, only an employment relationship is required for overtime rules to apply. Under the California Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders, an &quot;employer&quot; is &quot;any person ... who directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, employs or exercises control over wages, hours, or working conditions of any person.&quot; Under the California Labor Code, an &quot;employee&quot; is &quot;[any] person, including aliens and minors, rendering actual service in any business for an employer, whether gratuitously or for wages or pay, whether the wages or pay are measured by the standard of time, piece, task, commission, or other method of calculation, and whether the service is rendered on a commission, concessionaire, or other basis.&quot;

=====Coverage=====
Independent contractors are not employees covered by overtime laws and so it is important to determine if a worker is an independent contractor or an employee.

Foremost, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 510, non-exempt employees must be compensated at one and a half times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in a workday, 40 hours in a workweek and the first eight hours of a seventh consecutive workday. Employees in California are entitled to double-time for working more than twelve hour workdays or more than eight hours on the seventh consecutive workday of a single workweek. Under federal law there are only 40 hour weekly overtime limits. The eight-hour overtime limit in California frequently gives rise to wage-and-hour litigation for violations of state (but not federal) labour laws.

For example, &quot;comp time&quot; schemes in which employers tell employees that since they worked 10 hours on Monday they can work 6 hours on Tuesday are illegal because even though employees are not working more than 40 hours for the purposes of overtime compensation under federal law, they are working more than 8 hours for purposes of California overtime law, and rounding the 6- and 10-hour workdays to two 8-hour workdays would cheat the employee out of two hours of overtime pay.

Perhaps the biggest difference between California and federal overtime law relates to the administrative exemption&#x27;s &quot;primarily engaged&quot; in duties that meet the test for the exemption requirement, such as duties that involve exercising independent discretion and judgment as set forth in the controversial Order No. 4. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act &quot;primarily engaged&quot; does not necessarily mean at least half, but California wage-and-hour laws, working less than half of exempt duties automatically eliminates the overtime exemption.

<text>Abu al-ʿAbbās Abd Allāh ibn [[Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdallah|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Ali ibn Abd Allah ibn al-Abbas|ʿAlī]] ibn [[Ibn Abbas|ʿAbd Allāh]] ibn [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib|ʿal-ʿAbbās]] (‎; 721/722 – 8 June 754), known by his laqab al-Saffah (), was the first caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate, one of the longest and most important caliphates in Islamic history.

His &quot;al-Saffāḥ&quot; () means &quot;the Blood-Shedder&quot;. It may refer to his ruthless tactics, or perhaps it was used to intimidate his enemies, as it was common in history to adopt such names, an example for this is “Al Abbas” which means a “Lion that scares away other animals”.

==Family origins and earlier history==
As-Saffāḥ, born in Humeima (modern-day Jordan), was head of one branch of the Banu Hāshim from Arabia, a subclan of the Quraysh tribe who traced its lineage to Hāshim, a great-grandfather of Muhammad via &#x27;Abbās, an uncle of Muhammad, hence the title &quot;Abbasid&quot; for his descendants&#x27; caliphate. This indirect link to Muhammad&#x27;s larger clan formed sufficient basis for as-Saffah&#x27;s claim to the title &quot;caliph&quot;.

As-Saffah was the son of Muhammad ibn Ali and his mother, Rayta, was the daughter of a certain Ubayd Allah ibn Abd Allah.

As narrated in many hadith, many believed that in the end times a great leader or &quot;mahdi&quot; would appear from the family of Muhammad, to which Ali belonged, who would deliver Islam from corrupt leadership. The half-hearted policies of the late Umayyads to tolerate non-Arab Muslims and Shi&#x27;as had failed to quell unrest among these minorities.

During the reign of late Umayyad Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik this unrest led to a revolt in Kufa in southern Iraq, mainly by the town&#x27;s slaves. Shi&#x27;ites revolted in 736 and held the city until 740, led by Zayd ibn Ali, a grandson of Husayn and another member of the Banu Hashim. Zayd&#x27;s rebellion was put down by Umayyad armies in 740. The revolt in Kufa indicated both the strength of the Umayyads and the growing unrest in the Muslim world.

During the last days of the Umayyad caliphate, Abu al-‘Abbās and his clan chose to begin their rebellion in Khurasān, an important, but remote military region comprising eastern Iran, southern parts of the modern Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and northern Afghanistan. In 743, the death of the Umayyad Caliph Hishām provoked a rebellion in the east. Abu al-`Abbās, supported by Shi&#x27;as and the residents of Khurasān, led his forces to victory over the Umayyads. The civil war was marked by millennial prophecies encouraged by the beliefs of some Shi&#x27;as that as-Saffāḥ was the &quot;mahdi.&quot; In Shi&#x27;ite works such as the &quot;al-Jafr&quot; faithful Muslims were told that the brutal civil war was the great conflict between good and evil. The choice of the Umayyads to enter battle with white flags and the Abbasids to enter with black encouraged such theories. The color white, however, was regarded in much of Persia as a sign of mourning.

==Family tree==
Abbasid Caliphate was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad&#x27;s uncle, Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib (566–653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name.





==Caliphate==
In early October 749 (132 AH), Abu al-&#x27;Abbās as-Saffāh&#x27;s rebel army entered Kufa, a major Muslim center in Southern Iraq. As-Saffah had not been yet declared caliph. One of his priorities was to eliminate his Umayyad rival, caliph Marwan II. The latter was defeated in February 750 at a battle on the (Great) Zab river north of Baghdad, effectively ending the Umayyad caliphate, which had ruled since 661 AD. Marwan II fled back to Damascus, which didn&#x27;t welcome him, and was ultimately killed on the run in Egypt that August.
As-Saffah would go on to become the first Abbasid caliph, but he did not come forward to receive the pledge of allegiance from the people until after the Umayyad caliph and a large number of his princes were already killed.

In one far-reaching, historic decision, as-Saffāh established Kufa as the new capital of the caliphate, ending the dominance of Damascus in the Islamic political world, and Iraq would now become the seat of &#x27;Abbassid power for many centuries.

Later tales recount that, concerned that there would be a return of rival Umayyad power, as-Saffāh invited all of the remaining members of the Umayyad family to a dinner party where he had them clubbed to death before the first course, which was then served to the hosts. The only survivor, Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu&#x27;awiya, escaped to the province of al-Andalus (Spain), where the Umayyad dynasty would endure for three more centuries in the form of the Emirate of Córdoba and the subsequent Caliphate of Córdoba. Another version is that as-Saffāḥ&#x27;s new governor to Syria, &#x27;Abd Allāh ibn &#x27;Ali, hunted down the last of the family dynasty, with only Abd al-Rahmān escaping. Ultimately, &#x27;Abbasid rule was accepted even in Syria, and the beginning of the new Islamic dynasty was considered &quot;free from major internal dissensions.&quot;

As-Saffāh&#x27;s four-year reign was marked with efforts to consolidate and rebuild the caliphate. His supporters were represented in the new government, but apart from his policy toward the Umayyad family, as-Saffāh is widely viewed by historians as having been a mild victor. Jews, Nestorian Christians, and Persians were well represented in his government and in succeeding Abbasid administrations. Education was also encouraged, and the first paper mills, staffed by skilled Chinese prisoners captured at the Battle of Talas, were set up in Samarkand.

Equally revolutionary was as-Saffāh&#x27;s reform of the army, which came to include non-Muslims and non-Arabs in sharp contrast to the Umayyads who refused any soldiers of either type. As-Saffāh selected the gifted Abu Muslim as his military commander, an officer who would serve until 755 in the Abbasid army.

Not all Muslims accept the legitimacy of his caliphate, however. According to later Shi&#x27;ites, as-Saffāh turned back on his promises to the partisans of the Alids in claiming the title caliph for himself. The Shi&#x27;a had hoped that their &quot;imam&quot; would be named head of the caliphate, inaugurating the era of peace and prosperity the millennialists had believed would come. The betrayal alienated as-Saffāh&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a supporters, although the continued amity of other groups made Abbasid rule markedly more solvent than that of the Umayyads.

Caliph Abu al-`Abbās `Abdu’llāh as-Saffāḥ died of smallpox on 8 June 754 (13 Dhu al-Hijja 136 AH), only four years after taking the title of caliph. Before he died, as-Saffah appointed his brother Abu Ja&#x27;far al-Mansur and, following him, the caliph&#x27;s nephew Isa ibn Musa as his successors; ibn Musa, however, never filled the position.

==Abbasid Military Activities==

During his reign a great battle took place in 751 known as the Battle of Talas or &quot;Battle of Artlakh&quot; was a military engagement between the Abbasid Caliphate along with their ally the Tibetan Empire against the Chinese Tang dynasty. In July 751 AD, Tang and Abbasid forces met in the valley of the Talas River to vie for control over the Syr Darya region of central Asia. After several days of stalemate, the Karluk Turks originally allied to the Tang defected to the Abbasids and tipped the balance of power, resulting in a Tang rout.

The defeat marked the end of Tang westward expansion and resulted in Muslim control of Transoxiana for the next 400 years. Control of this region was economically beneficial for the Abbasids because it was on the Silk Road. Historians debate whether or not Chinese prisoners captured in the aftermath of the battle brought paper-making technology to the Middle East, where it eventually spread to Europe.

The numbers of combatants involved in the Battle of Talas are not known with certainty; however, various estimates exist. The Abbasid army (200,000 Muslim troops according to Chinese estimates, though these numbers may be greatly exaggerated) which included contingents from their Tibetan ally met the combined army of 10,000 Tang Chinese and 20,000 Karluk mercenaries (Arab records put the Chinese forces at 100,000 which also may be greatly exaggerated).

In the month of July 751, the Abbasid forces joined in combat with the Tang Chinese force (the combined army of Tang Chinese and Karluk mercenaries) on the banks of the Talas river.
The Tang army was subjected to a devastating defeat. The Tang dynasty&#x27;s defeat was due to the defection of Karluk mercenaries and the retreat of Ferghana allies who originally supported the Chinese. The Karluk mercenaries, two-thirds of the Tang army, defected to the Abbasids during the battle; Karluk troops attacked the Tang army from close quarters while the main Abbasid forces attacked from the front. The Tang troops were unable to hold their positions, and the commander of the Tang forces, Gao Xianzhi, recognized that defeat was imminent and managed to escape with some of his Tang regulars with the help of Li Siye. Out of an estimated 10,000 Tang troops, only 2,000 managed to return from Talas to their territory in Central Asia. Despite losing the battle, Li did inflict heavy losses on the pursuing Arab army after being reproached by Duan Xiushi. After the battle, Gao was prepared to organize another Tang army against the Arabs when the devastating An Shi Rebellion broke out in 755. When the Tang capital was taken by rebels, all Chinese armies stationed in Central Asia were ordered back to China proper to crush the rebellion.

Also in 751, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine V led an invasion across the frontier of the Caliphate. The Byzantines captured Theodosiopolis (Erzurum) and Melitene (Malatya), which was demolished. There was no serious attempt to retain control of the captured cities, except for Camachum (modern Kemah, Erzincan), which was garrisoned.

==Succession==
As-Saffah died after a five-year reign and al-Mansur took on the responsibility of establishing the Abbasid caliphate by holding on to power for nearly 22 years, from Dhu al-Hijjah 136 AH until Dhu al-Hijjah 158 AH (754 – 775). Al-Mansur was proclaimed Caliph on his way to Mecca in the year 753 (136 AH) and was inaugurated the following year. Abu Ja&#x27;far Abdallah ibn Muhammad took the name al-Mansur (&quot;the victorious&quot;) and agreed to make his nephew Isa ibn Musa his Heir to the Abbasid caliphate. This agreement was supposed to resolve rivalries in the Abbasid family, but al-Mansur&#x27;s right to accession was particularly challenged by his uncle Abdullah ibn Ali. Once in power, caliph al-Mansur had his uncle imprisoned in 754 and killed in 764.

==Legacy==
Al-Saffah was the First Arab caliph from the Caliphal Abbasid dynasty. He nominated his brother Abu Ja&#x27;far Abdallah as heir, because his own son was too young to succeeded to the Caliphate. His brother nominated his son (al-Saffah&#x27;s nephew) as heir. Al-Saffah&#x27;s nephew nominated his two sons as heir. Even though al-Saffah&#x27;s son never ascended to Caliphate, his children remained influential. In 761, his nephew Muhammad (future caliph al-Mahdi) married Rayta as his first wife after his return from Khurasan. She gave birth to two sons, Ubaydallah and Ali. His elder grandson, Ubaydallah was appointed as governor of Arminiyah and the northwestern provinces in 788/9. He was later appointed to two brief stints as governor of Egypt, in 795 and 796.
His second grandson, Ali was the uncle and father-in-law of sixth Abbasid caliph al-Amin through his daughter Lubana.

<text>Amira Hass (; born 28 June 1956) is an Israeli journalist and author, mostly known for her columns in the daily newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; covering Palestinian affairs in Gaza and the West Bank, where she has lived for almost thirty years.

==Biography==
The daughter of two Holocaust survivors, Hass is the only child of a Bosnian-born Sephardic Jewish mother, who survived nine months in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, and a Romanian-born Ashkenazi Jewish father. In her own words, her parents &quot;were never Zionists, but they found themselves in Israel as refugees after the Holocaust&quot;. Hass was born in Jerusalem and educated at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she studied the history of Nazism and the European Left&#x27;s relation to the Holocaust.

==Journalism career==
Frustrated by the events of the First Intifada and by what she considered their inadequate coverage in the Israeli media, she started to report from the Palestinian territories in 1991. As of 2003 she is the only Jewish Israeli journalist who has lived full-time among the Palestinians, in Gaza from 1993 to 1997 and in Ramallah since.

In September 2014 Hass attended a conference in Birzeit University organised by the leftist German Rosa Luxemburg Foundation and the Center for Development Studies at the university. She was asked to leave by two Birzeit lecturers because of a rule against the presence of Israelis (which she judged to mean Israeli Jews). She said that she had attended the university many times and had never heard of such a rule. The international conference&#x27;s organizers were offended. The regional head of the Rosa Luxembourg Foundation, Katja Hermann, said after the incident that she would not have agreed to hold the conference at Birzeit had she been aware of the policy. The university later issued a statement saying, &quot;The administration has nothing against the presence of the journalist Hass.&quot;

=== Defamation case ===
In June 2001, Judge Rachel Shalev-Gartel of the Jerusalem Magistrate&#x27;s Court ruled that Hass had defamed the Jewish settler community of Beit Hadassah in Hebron and ordered her to pay 250,000 shekels (about $60,000) in damages. Hass had published accounts by Palestinians that claimed Israeli settlers defiled the body of a Palestinian militant killed by Israeli police; the settlers said that the event did not take place and that Hass had falsely reported the story with malicious intent. The presiding judge found in favour of the settlers, saying that television accounts contradicted Hass&#x27;s account and ruling that Hass&#x27;s report damaged that community&#x27;s reputation. &quot;Haaretz&quot; indicated that it did not have time to arrange a defense in the case and indicated that it would appeal the decision. Hass said that she had brought forward sourced information from the Palestinian community and said that it was the responsibility of newspaper editors to cross-reference it with other information from the IDF and the settler community.

=== Legal issues ===
On 1 December 2008, Hass, who had traveled to Gaza aboard a protest vessel, had to flee the strip due to threats to her life after she criticized Hamas. She was arrested by Israeli police on her return to Israel for being in Gaza without a permit.

After residing in the Gaza Strip for several months, Hass was again arrested by Israeli police upon her return to Israel on 12 May 2009 &quot;for violating a law which forbids residence in an enemy state&quot;.

== Views and opinions ==
Hass identifies as a leftist. In 2011 she joined the Freedom Flotilla II to Gaza. In a speech in Vancouver, when asked whether there is any hope for the region, Hass answered, &quot;Only if we continue to build a bi-national movement against Israeli apartheid.&quot;

In 2006 she compared Israeli policies toward the Palestinian population to those of South Africa during apartheid, saying, &quot;The Palestinians, as a people, are divided into subgroups, something which is reminiscent also of South Africa under apartheid rule.&quot;

In April 2013 Hass wrote an article in &quot;Haaretz&quot; defending Palestinian stone-throwing, calling it &quot;the birthright and duty of anyone subject to foreign rule&quot;. She was criticized by politician Yossi Beilin and Adva Biton, whose three-year-old daughter was critically injured during a Palestinian rock attack. The Yesha Council filed a complaint with Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein and the police, accusing Hass of incitement to violence because stone throwing &quot;has caused death and serious injuries&quot; to Israelis.

In 2018, Hass suggested that the EU introduce visas for Israeli citizens, asking every applicant whether they had collaborated in war crimes or lived in occupied territory. According to Hass, this would &quot;make Israelis realize that this reality is not normal&quot; and would not be antisemitic, but would benefit Jews in the future, &quot;sav[ing] us from Israeli policies of today&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
Hass was the recipient of the World Press Freedom Hero award from the International Press Institute in 2000.

On 27 June 2001, Hass received the Golden Dove of Peace Prize awarded by the Rome-based organization &quot;Archivo Disarmo&quot;.

In 2002 she was honoured with a Prince Claus Award from the Dutch culture and development organisation Prince Claus Fund.

She won the Bruno Kreisky Human Rights Award in 2002, the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize in 2003 and the inaugural award from the Anna Lindh Memorial Fund in 2004.

In September 2009, Hass received the Hrant Dink International Award, with Alper Görmüş.

On 20 October 2009, Hass received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Women&#x27;s Media Foundation.

In December 2009 Hass was awarded the Reporters Without Borders Prize for Press Freedom &quot;for her independent and outspoken reporting from the Gaza Strip for the Israeli daily Ha&#x27;aretz during Operation Cast Lead, the offensive which Israel waged against the territory from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009&quot;.

She is expected to be the commencement speaker for the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism on May 15, 2024, in New York City.

<text>Vernon God Little (2003) is a novel by DBC Pierre. It was his debut novel and won the Man Booker Prize in 2003. It has twice been adapted as a stage play.

==Plot synopsis==

The life of Vernon Little, a normal teenager who lives in Martirio, Texas, falls apart when his best friend, Jesus Navarro, murders their classmates in the schoolyard before killing himself, and Vernon is taken in for questioning. He cooperates with Deputy Vaine Gurie, because he had been running an errand for a teacher, Mr Nuckles, and is not involved in the massacre. The perception of Vernon&#x27;s innocence weakens when his Mom&#x27;s best friend, the food-obsessed Palmyra (Pam) arrives and, against Vernon&#x27;s better judgment, whisks him off to Bar-B-Chew Barn, allowing the police to claim he is a flight risk. Eulalio (&quot;Lally&quot;) Ledesma, supposedly a CNN reporter, ingratiates himself to Vernon&#x27;s mother, Doris, and promises to help Vernon &quot;shift the paradigm&quot; of his story. Instead, Lally betrays Vernon, who is returned to jail pending a psychiatric analysis.

When the court-appointed shrink, Dr Goosens, touches him inappropriately, Vernon leaves, knowing it can wreck hopes for bail. Vernon&#x27;s bail hearing suggests a possible alibi and no grounds for holding him, so Vernon is released as Goosens&#x27; outpatient, subject to regular sessions. Vernon, however, is intent on living out the movie &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, repelled by Lally not only betraying him again with a video interview with Nuckles, but also by insinuating himself into Vernon&#x27;s family life—including sharing Mom&#x27;s bedroom. 

Learning a posse intends to search Keeter&#x27;s field, where his rifle is hidden, Vernon races to beat them but meets a stranger who reveals Lally is a fraud. Vernon confirms it by phoning Lally&#x27;s blind, neglected mother and plans how to get her to talk with Mom. Vernon cannot control his temper well enough to make the evidence stick, however, but Lally worries enough to bail out and move in with her friend Leona. To pacify Mom, Vernon lies about finding a job, but when he skips a session with Goosens and word comes that his rifle has been found, he extorts money from an old pervert by photographing him with Ella Bouchard, a local girl, and catches a bus to San Antonio. There he phones Taylor, his crush, and meets her in Houston, where she attends college. However, their meeting ends when Leona (Vernon&#x27;s mom&#x27;s friend) turns out to be Taylor&#x27;s cousin and turns up to meet her. 

Fast talk and money get Vernon into Mexico without identification, and a truck driver, Pelayo, takes him to his dream world on the beach near Acapulco. Vernon awakens on his 16th birthday on top of the world, but plunges when Taylor&#x27;s wired $600 does not arrive. Instead, against all odds, Taylor comes in person, takes him to a fancy hotel, and uses her wiles to get him to admit he is a murderer. Not suspecting a string of murders across Central Texas are attributed to him or that Lally has recruited Taylor, Vernon gives an out-of-context confession. Lally&#x27;s people seize Vernon, turn him over to Federal marshals, and he lands in the Harris County lock-up for the summer. 

In the fall, Vernon&#x27;s trial is televised, with court officials, witnesses, and Vernon being made up for the cameras. Vernon trusts the system implicitly. His lawyer exposes Goosens&#x27; criminal behavior, discrediting his testimony for the State, and Taylor and Lally are seen entrapping Vernon. Vernon&#x27;s attempt to tell the whole truth fails, however, when the State produces Pelayo&#x27;s affidavit, which provides no alibi, because Vernon uses an alias in Mexico. Nuckles alone can clear Vernon when he testifies, but explosively calls him a murderer. Vernon is cleared of the Central Texas rampage but convicted of the schoolyard slayings and is sent to death row.

Lally has expanded his multimedia empire to include the ultimate reality show: an execution lottery. An axe murderer turned popular preacher helps Vernon figure out his feelings towards Mom, advises him to watch animal and human behavior, and to realize Vernon is God. Vernon struggles to do this as he survives several votes, but eventually his turn comes. He thinks about what presents he can give the various people in his life. He makes kind phone calls to people able to pull together an operation that destroys Lally and proves Vernon&#x27;s innocence. 

A pardon comes seconds before the deadly chemicals are to flow into his arm. The den also yields up Jesus&#x27; suicide note, condemning Goosens and Nuckles to prison for pedophilia. Vernon and Ella prepare for a vacation in Mexico, and everything in Martirio returns to normal.

==Themes and style==
The Man Booker Prize judges described this book as a &quot;coruscating black comedy reflecting our alarm but also our fascination with America&quot;.

The character of Vernon as a troubled teenager has drawn comparisons with the character Holden Caulfield in J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; novel. There are also significant similarities with Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;.

The book is written in contemporary vernacular, with the use of satirical invective and witty irony. The name of the town in which Vernon lives, Martirio, is the Spanish word for martyrdom.

==Awards and nominations==

Published in 2003, the novel was awarded the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for Comic Fiction and the Man Booker Prize for Fiction, which included the £50,000 prize. Upon winning the prize, Pierre said that the money was &quot;a third of what I owe in the world&quot; and promptly used it to repay old debts. He also won the first novel award in the 2003 Whitbread Awards.

==Reception==
&quot;Vernon God Little&quot; was generally well-received among British press. According to &quot;Book Marks&quot;, based mostly on American press, the book received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews based on ten critic reviews, with three being &quot;rave&quot; and one being &quot;positive&quot; and two being &quot;mixed&quot; and four being &quot;pan&quot;. Globally, &quot;Complete Review&quot; saying on the consensus &quot;No consensus whatsoever -- with the American critics far more critical than the British ones&quot;.

Jonathan Lethem, author of &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, wrote: &quot;Read &quot;Vernon God Little&quot; not only for its dangerous relevance, but for the coruscating wit and raw vitality of its voice.&quot;

&quot;The Times&quot; wrote: &quot;A satire brimming with opprobrium for.. [the] demi-culture of reality television, fast food and speedily delivered death... a bulging burrito of a book.&quot;

John Carey, Merton Professor of English Literature at University of Oxford and chairman of Man Booker judges in 2003, said: &quot;Reading [Pierre&#x27;s] book made me think of how the English language was in Shakespeare&#x27;s day, enormously free and inventive and very idiomatic and full of poetry as well.&quot;

Theodore Dalrymple wrote that the novel &quot;was a work of unutterably tedious nastiness and vulgarity&quot; that &quot;manifested itself even in its first sentence, and grew worse as the first paragraph progressed&quot;; Dalrymple described the author as &quot;a man with no discernible literary talent whose vulgarity of mind was deep and thoroughgoing&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Michiko Kakutani concluded that &quot;In trying to score a lot of obvious points off a lot of obvious targets, Mr. Pierre may have won the Booker Prize and ratified some ugly stereotypes of Americans, but he hasn&#x27;t written a terribly convincing or compelling novel.&quot;

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==

Rufus Norris directed a critically acclaimed stage adaptation by Tanya Ronder at the Young Vic theatre in 2007, starring Colin Morgan as Vernon and Penny Layden as Vaine.
Ronder&#x27;s adaptation and the Young Vic production was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. The play was published in 2007, and a revised version was published in 2011.

German director Werner Herzog has been developing a possible film adaptation of &quot;Vernon God Little&quot; based on a screenplay by Andrew Birkin. The project was at one point to star Austin Abrams, Sasha Pieterse, Russell Brand, Pamela Anderson, and Mike Tyson.

<text>A jungle is land covered with dense forest and tangled vegetation, usually in tropical climates. Application of the term has varied greatly during the past century.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;jungle&quot; originates from the Sanskrit word &quot;jaṅgala&quot; (), meaning rough and arid. It came into the English language in the 18th century via the Hindustani word for forest (Hindi/Urdu: /) (Jangal). &quot;Jāṅgala&quot; has also been variously transcribed in English as &quot;jangal&quot;, &quot;jangla&quot;, &quot;jungal&quot;, and &quot;juṅgala&quot;.
It has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense &quot;tangled thicket&quot;. The term is prevalent in many languages of the Indian subcontinent, and the Iranian Plateau, where it is commonly used to refer to the plant growth replacing primeval forest or to the unkempt tropical vegetation that takes over abandoned areas.

==Wildlife==

Because jungles occur on all inhabited landmasses and may incorporate numerous vegetation and land types in different climatic zones, the wildlife of jungles cannot be straightforwardly defined.

==Varying usage==
===As dense and tangled vegetation===

One of the most common meanings of &quot;jungle&quot; is land overgrown with tangled vegetation at ground level, especially in the tropics. Typically such vegetation is sufficiently dense to hinder movement by humans, requiring that travellers cut their way through. This definition draws a distinction between rainforest and jungle, since the understorey of rainforests is typically open of vegetation due to a lack of sunlight, and hence relatively easy to traverse. Jungles may exist within, or at the borders of, tropical forests in areas where the woodland has been opened through natural disturbance such as hurricanes, or through human activity such as logging. The successional vegetation that springs up following such disturbance, is dense and tangled and is a &quot;typical&quot; jungle. Jungle also typically forms along rainforest margins such as stream banks, once again due to the greater available light at ground level.

Monsoon forests and mangroves are commonly referred to as jungles of this type. Having a more open canopy than rainforests, monsoon forests typically have dense understoreys with numerous lianas and shrubs making movement difficult, while the prop roots and low canopies of mangroves produce similar difficulties.

===As moist forest===
Because European explorers initially travelled through tropical forests largely by river, the dense tangled vegetation lining the stream banks gave a misleading impression that such jungle conditions existed throughout the entire forest. As a result, it was wrongly assumed that the entire forest was impenetrable jungle. This in turn appears to have given rise to the second popular usage of jungle as virtually any humid tropical forest. Jungle in this context is particularly associated with tropical rain forest, but may extend to cloud forest, temperate rainforest, and mangroves with no reference to the vegetation structure or the ease of travel.

The terms &quot;tropical forest&quot; and &quot;rainforest&quot; have largely replaced &quot;jungle&quot; as the descriptor of humid tropical forests, a linguistic transition that has occurred since the 1970s. &quot;Rainforest&quot; itself did not appear in English dictionaries prior to the 1970s. The word &quot;jungle&quot; accounted for over 80% of the terms used to refer to tropical forests in print media prior to the 1970s; since then it has been steadily replaced by &quot;rainforest&quot;, although &quot;jungle&quot; still remains in common use when referring to tropical rainforests.

=== As metaphor ===
As a metaphor, &quot;jungle&quot; often refers to situations that are unruly or lawless, or where the only law is perceived to be &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. This reflects the view of &quot;city people&quot; that forests are such places. Upton Sinclair gave the title &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1906) to his famous book about the life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards, portraying the workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or other lawful recourse.

The term &quot;The Law of the Jungle&quot; is also used in a similar context, drawn from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1894)—though in the society of jungle animals portrayed in that book and obviously meant as a metaphor for human society, that phrase referred to an intricate code of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to a lawless chaos.

The word &quot;jungle&quot; carries connotations of untamed and uncontrollable nature and isolation from civilisation, along with the emotions that evokes: threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation and immobilisation. The change from &quot;jungle&quot; to &quot;rainforest&quot; as the preferred term for describing tropical forests has been a response to an increasing perception of these forests as fragile and spiritual places, a viewpoint not in keeping with the darker connotations of &quot;jungle&quot;.

Cultural scholars, especially post-colonial critics, often analyse the jungle within the concept of hierarchical domination and the demand western cultures often places on other cultures to conform to their standards of civilisation. For example: Edward Said notes that the Tarzan depicted by Johnny Weissmuller was a resident of the jungle representing the savage, untamed and wild, yet still a white master of it; and in his essay &quot;An Image of Africa&quot; about &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; Nigerian novelist and theorist Chinua Achebe notes how the jungle and Africa become the source of temptation for white European characters like Marlowe and Kurtz.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak compared Israel to &quot;a villa in the jungle&quot;, a comparison which had been often quoted in Israeli political debates. Barak&#x27;s critics on the left side of Israeli politics strongly criticised the comparison.

<text>Kowloon East is the eastern part of Kowloon, covering the Wong Tai Sin and Kwun Tong District, with Kowloon City District occasionally included.

== History ==
The boundary of Kowloon East is not strictly defined and hence varies. While traditionally the Kowloon–Canton Railway (now the East Rail line) serves as the separation of eastern and western part, the Kowloon City District, located at the east of the railway, was part of the Kowloon West Legislative Council constituency in order to balance the population between the two halves. Nevertheless, the Kwun Tong District has long been regarded as the part of Kowloon East, while Wong Tai Sin District is sometimes seen as either in Kowloon Central or Kowloon East. Naming of Kowloon East can be seen in the planned East Kowloon line which connects Diamond Hill to Sheung Wan via East Kowloon neighbourhoods, and East Kowloon Corridor which links Kai Tak to Hung Hom.

In 1985, &quot;Kowloon City&quot;, &quot;Kwun Tong&quot; and &quot;Wong Tai Sin&quot; electoral-college constituencies were created, composing of the members of the District Boards of Kowloon City District, Kwun Tong and Wong Tai Sin and corresponding members of the Urban Council for the first ever Legislative Council election. The electoral colleges lasted for two terms until they were replaced by the geographical constituencies in 1991 when the first direct election to the Legislative Council were introduced.

In the 1991 election, the region was divided into two constituency, &quot;Kowloon East&quot; consisting of the Kwun Tong District and &quot;Kowloon Central&quot; consisting of Wong Tai Sin and Kowloon City Districts, each returning two members to the Legislative Council using the two-seat constituency two vote system. All four seats were won by the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) in an electoral landslide. A by-election was held for Kowloon Central constituency after Lau Chin-shek resigned.

The electoral system was overhauled after one term, replaced by the single-constituency single-vote system in the 1995 Legislative Council election, with four new constituencies, with four new constituencies known as &quot;Kowloon East&quot;, &quot;Kowloon South-east&quot;, &quot;Kowloon North-east&quot; and &quot;Kowloon Central&quot; being created. The pro-democrats again won all of the seats, with ADPL&#x27;s Bruce Liu defeated pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) chairman Jasper Tsang in Kowloon Central. except Kowloon North-east which elected veteran pro-Beijing trade unionist Chan Yuen-han of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB).

Following the handover in 1997, the &quot;Kowloon East&quot; replaced the colonial constituencies, with Kowloon City District redistributed into the Kowloon West constituency. It remained in place until 2021 under the change of electoral system, &quot;Kowloon East&quot; and &quot;Kowloon Central&quot; were installed as the new constituencies, with the former one covering the Kwun Tong District and south-eastern Wong Tai Sin District while the latter one consisted of Kowloon City and most of Wong Tai Sin District.

<text>Kowloon West is the western part of Kowloon, covering the Yau Tsim Mong and Sham Shui Po District, with Kowloon City District occasionally included.

== History ==
The boundary of Kowloon West is not strictly defined and hence varies. While traditionally the Kowloon–Canton Railway (now the East Rail line) serves as the separation of eastern and western part, the Kowloon City District, located at the east of the railway, was part of the Kowloon West Legislative Council constituency in order to balance the population between the two halves. Nevertheless, both the Yau Tsim Mong District and Sham Shui Po District have long been regarded as the part of Kowloon West.

West Kowloon, a similar name and sharing similar definition, is also a part of Kowloon West, despite the name usually refers to the reclaimed area located west of the Kowloon Peninsula.

In 1985, &quot;Sham Shui Po&quot; and &quot;South Kowloon&quot; electoral-college constituencies were created. Sham Shui Po consisted of Sham Shui Po District while South Kowloon consisted of Mong Kok District and Yau Ma Tei District. The electoral colleges lasted for two terms until they were replaced by the geographical constituencies in 1991 when the first direct election to the Legislative Council were introduced.

In the 1991 election, &quot;Kowloon West&quot; was consisting of Sham Shui Po, Mong Kok and Yau Tsim Districts, returning two members to the Legislative Council using the two-seat constituency two vote system. All two seats were won by the pro-democracy camp in the electoral landslide, with United Democrats of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People&#x27;s Livelihood gained one each.

The electoral system was overhauled after one term, replaced by the single-constituency single-vote system in the 1995 Legislative Council election with four new constituencies, namely &quot;Kowloon West&quot; and &quot;Kowloon South-west&quot;. All two seats were again won by the pro-democrats.

Following the handover in 1997, the &quot;Kowloon West&quot; constituency replaced the colonial constituencies, which included the Kowloon City. It remained in place until 2021 under the change of electoral system, &quot;Kowloon West&quot; was kept but shrank to the 1991-constituency boundary.

<doc id="341285" wikidata="Q3051731" url="?curid=341285" title="Elsa Peretti">
<text>Elsa Peretti, OMRI OMM (1 May 1940 – 18 March 2021), was an Italian jewelry designer and philanthropist as well as a fashion model. Her jewelry and design pieces for Tiffany &amp; Co. are included in the 20th century collection of the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. In 1974 Peretti, the &quot;Halstonette&quot; fashion model arrived at Tiffany&#x27;s with her modern jewelry. Her broadly popular work, including pieces like Bean, Bone Cuff and Open Heart, became as much as 10% of Tiffany&#x27;s business and John Loring&#x27;s &quot;Tiffany Style – 170 Years of Design&quot; devotes 18 pages of images to her jewelry and tableware design. &quot;Vogue&quot; described her as &quot;arguably the most successful woman ever to work in the jewelry field.&quot; As a philanthropist, Peretti supported a wide variety of causes, and also privately undertook the restoration of the historic village of Sant Martí Vell in Catalonia, Spain.

The TV miniseries &quot;Halston&quot; features Elsa&#x27;s relationship with Halston. In 2019, she was featured in archival footage about her relationship with the legendary designer in the documentary film &quot;Halston&quot;.

== Early life ==

Peretti was born in Florence, Italy as the youngest daughter of (1896–1977) and Maria Luisa Pighini. Ferdinando Peretti founded Anonima Petroli Italiana (API), a large Italian oil company, in 1933. She was estranged from her conservative family for much of her life, though reconciled with her father shortly before he died.

Peretti was educated in Rome and Switzerland. She initially made her living teaching French and working as a ski instructor in the German-speaking Swiss mountain village of Gstaad. Later, she returned to Rome to pursue a degree in interior design, and then worked for the Milan architect Dado Torrigiani.

== Career ==

===Modeling===

In 1964, Peretti became a fashion model, working in Barcelona, Spain. In 1968 she moved to New York City on the advice of Wilhelmina Modeling Agency. In the early 1970s, along with Karen Bjornson, Anjelica Huston, Alva Chinn, Pat Cleveland, Chris Royer, and Pat Ast, among others, she became one of designer Halston&#x27;s favoured troupe of models, nicknamed the Halstonettes.

During the late 1970s Peretti was a frequent regular of Studio 54, alongside designer Halston, Andy Warhol, Liza Minnelli, Bianca Jagger, Cher, and Donald and Ivana Trump.

According to Halston, &quot;Elsa had style: she made the dress she was modeling her own.&quot; Helmut Newton″s photograph &quot;Elsa Peretti in Bunny Costume&quot;—she posed for him in a Playboy Bunny costume on Halloween 1975—is considered a lasting image of the 1970s.

In 2019, she was interviewed in the documentary &quot;Halston&quot; (CNN films), recalling her years of working, partying, and friendship with the designer.

===Jewelry design===

In 1969, Peretti began creating new jewelry styles for a handful of fashion designers in Manhattan. Her first design, working with a silversmith in Spain, was a two-inch bud vase made of sterling-silver as a pendant on a leather thong necklace, that was inspired by a find at a flea market. Worn in a runway show by one of Giorgio di Sant&#x27; Angelo&#x27;s models, it was a hit. By 1971, she was designing jewelry for Halston. She continued to use silver, helping shift the material&#x27;s standing from &quot;common&quot; to a popular choice for Liza Minnelli and others. Minnelli recalled encountering Peretti&#x27;s work after Halston advised her to try wearing silver: &quot; ‘My god,&#x27; I thought...All I could think of was Albuquerque. But then Elsa brought out all these things...Everything was so sensual, so sexy. I just loved it.&quot;

Peretti quickly rose in the jewelry field, receiving the 1971 Coty Award for jewelry design, and had her first appearance in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine. In 1972 Bloomingdale&#x27;s, one of New York&#x27;s landmark department stores, opened a dedicated Peretti boutique. In 1974, she signed a contract with Tiffany &amp; Co to design silver jewelry; her work for them was the first time Tiffany had sold jewelry in that material in 25 years. By 1979, she was the firm&#x27;s leading designer. Her silver pieces were seen as &quot;fun&quot; and attracted a younger clientele. The introduction of silver revised the category of fine jewelry and, comparatively more affordable, became something women began increasingly buying for themselves as opposed to traditionally receiving as a gift. Peretti&#x27;s reintroduction of silver to the company proved so popular that in 2002, the company began raising prices simply to retain a sense of exclusivity for the brand.

Peretti designed over thirty collections for Tiffany, with works described as &quot;revolutionary&quot;, &quot;timeless, distinct and modern&quot;. Her process included travel to Japan, China, and Europe and drew on the work of craftsmen there in the creation of successful collections such as Bean (an abstracted lima bean-shaped pendant), Open Heart, Mesh, Bone, and Zodiac. In addition to the sterling silver, part of her signature was the use of materials such as jade, lacquer, and rattan. Modern art was an influence; she cited Alexander Calder and Henry Moore&#x27;s sculptures as inspirations for her Open Heart collection of pendant jewelry featuring an off-center heart outline. Pieces like Bone Cuff (1970) incorporated organic forms with appreciation of the human body, and were seen as bridging a gap between costume and serious jewelry. Peretti drew the shape from the bones of monks she&#x27;d seen inside a 17th-century Capuchin church near Rome during her childhood. Enduringly popular, Gal Gadot wore an 18-karat gold version in the 2020 film &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; and Sarah Jessica Parker wore it as Carrie Bradshaw in the first &quot;Sex and the&quot; &quot;City&quot; film (2008).

The work sold at a large variety of price points, partly dependent on materials; as of 2021, one version of Peretti&#x27;s Diamonds by the Yard necklace sold for $400 while another was priced at $75,000. In 2012, Tiffany and Peretti extended their contract for another 20 years, paid up front for $47 million. In 2015, her trademarked Elsa Peretti designs represented eight percent of Tiffany&#x27;s net sales; in other years the figure has been more than 10%.
Peretti also designed silverware for Tiffany, but only after she had established a solid following with her jewelry. Her creations were expansive (besides silverware, which included a silver pizza cutter, she also designed pens, ashtrays, a gold mesh bra, and perfume bottles for Halston), but the jewelry line remained the center of her work. &quot;Vogue&quot; calls her &quot;arguably the most successful woman ever to work in the jewelry field.&quot;

In 2024, Tiffany introduced the Elsa Peretti Split Ring to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Peretti&#x27;s collaboration with the brand. This ring draws inspiration from Peretti&#x27;s Bone cuff design.

== Catalonia, Spain ==

In 1968, Peretti bought a house in the largely decrepit village of Sant Martí Vell in Catalonia, Spain. Over the next ten years she had the house restored, often living in rough conditions during the process. By the 1980s, the mustard-yellow house was her preferred home. Pieces such as her scorpion necklace, now in the British Museum, were inspired by the flora and fauna of Sant Martí Vell.

Originally Peretti described a hope for building an artist colony, but the town became &quot;her own private village&quot;, wrote &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Peretti worked to restore parts of the surrounding village, purchasing additional buildings and having them renovated. As of 2017, about half the village had been rebuilt. 
Her projects included the renovation of the interior of Església de Sant Martí Vell, the parochial church of Sant Martí Vell in 2012–2013. The site has a long history, encompassing a Roman settlement in the second century AD, a medieval enclosure, a Romanic Temple in the 11th–12th century, and the construction of a late-Gothic-style edifice in the late 1500s. The work done included the excavation of archaeological remains of a Roman settlement and the refinishing of a sepulchral tomb, as well as the restoration of existing elements and the provision of new ones. Peretti also supported the management of the sixteenth-century historical documents of the town, the conservation of the photographic archive of Oriol Maspons and the conservation of the Roman city of Empúries.

Peretti established a working vineyard in Sant Martí, planting Ca l&#x27;Elsa in 2004 and Can Nobas in 2007. The winery itself was completed in 2008, marketed under the Eccocivi label.

Peretti also promoted the visual arts and the historical, artistic, and architectural heritage of Catalonia. She encouraged people such as guitarist Michael Laucke and painter-sculptor Robert Llimós to make use of San Marti Vell. In 2013, Peretti was the first non-Catalan person awarded the National Culture Award by the National Council for Culture and the Arts (CoNCA).

== Philanthropy ==
In 2000, Peretti created a charity in honor of her father, called the Nando Peretti Foundation (NPF). The foundation is reported to have given approximately 42 million euros to 852 projects world-wide over 15 years. As of 2015, it was renamed the Nando and Elsa Peretti Foundation (NaEPF).

Initially the foundation had a dual focus on the environment and wildlife conservation, and on humanitarian programs, particular those targeting poverty. Over time, the foundation&#x27;s scope has expanded to support a broad range of projects for &quot;promotion of human and civil rights, with a special emphasis on the right to education, children&#x27;s rights, and women&#x27;s rights and dignity.&quot; The NaEPF solicits proposals internationally, especially on behalf of unrepresented minorities, to defend their right to exist and preserve their culture. The NaEPF also supports medical and scientific research projects as well as building hospitals and other facilities.

==Personal life==
In the 1970s, Peretti was romantically involved with photographer Helmut Newton.

<doc id="341286" wikidata="Q2358467" url="?curid=341286" title="St. Stephen, New Brunswick">
<text>St. Stephen is a Canadian town in Charlotte County, New Brunswick, situated on the east bank of the St. Croix River around the intersection of New Brunswick Route 170 and the southern terminus of New Brunswick Route 3. The St. Croix River marks a section of the Canada–United States border, forming a natural border between Calais, Maine and St. Stephen. U.S. Route 1 parallels the St. Croix river for a few miles, and is accessed from St. Stephen by three cross-border bridges.

On 1 January 2023, St. Stephen annexed all or part of seven local service districts and was renamed the Municipal District of St. Stephen, retaining town status. Revised census figures have not been released.

==History==

The Peskotomuhkati people (formerly referred to as the Passamaquoddy) were the first to make their home along the St. Croix River. They dispersed and hunted inland in the winter; in the summer, they gathered more closely together on the coast and islands, and primarily harvested seafood, including porpoise. In 1604, French explorer Samuel de Champlain and his men spent a winter here. The Peskotomuhkati were forced off their original lands repeatedly by European settlers since that time.

=== Raid on St. Stephen (1704) ===
During Queen Anne&#x27;s War, in response to the French Raid on Deerfield, New Englander Major Benjamin Church raided the Acadian villages of Castine, Maine (then known as Penobscot). From the Raid on Castine, Church learned that Michel Chartier was granted the land of present-day St. Stephen and was building a fort at Passamaquoddy Bay. Church and his men arrived at the Passamaquoddy Bay on board the &quot;Province Galley&quot;, &quot;Gosport&quot;, &quot;Fearly&quot;, and several other vessels. Church travelled up the St. Croix River to St. Stephen and, on 7 June 1704, took Chartier by surprise and his family fled into the woods. On June 13, Church reported they were destroying the crops of the Acadians and the Acadians and Peskotomuhkati fired upon Church&#x27;s troops, resulting in a three-hour exchange. Church killed and imprisoned 35 Acadians and Peskotomuhkati, one of Church&#x27;s men was wounded, and the community was pillaged and plundered.

After the Raid on St. Stephen, Church moved on to raid other Acadian villages in the Raid on Grand Pré, the Raid on Piziquid, and the Raid on Chignecto.

=== St. Stephen incorporated (1871) ===

St. Stephen was officially incorporated as a town in 1871.

===Controversy over HBRC railway (1873−1875)===
Immediately prior to Confederation, the Legislature of New Brunswick passed a bill that incorporated the Houlton Branch Railway Company (HBRC) with the aim to build a railway between Debec, New Brunswick and Houlton, Maine. This was in hopes of completing a portion of the St. Andrews and Quebec Railway. In 1870, the Legislature of New Brunswick passed an Act, which authorized Charlotte County to issue debentures to pay a bonus of $15,000 to the HBRC in order to encourage it to complete the railway. The debenture could only be issued if authorized by a public meeting of the ratepayers of St. Stephen, who would assume the obligation of paying for the interest and principal of the debenture. A majority of the ratepayers of St. Stephen duly passed the necessary vote and the County issued the debenture. Some residents of St. Stephen who opposed the measure challenged the tax assessment in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, arguing that the provincial Legislature lacked the constitutional authority to authorise a tax to support the building of an international railway, as that would intrude on the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.

In 1873, the Supreme Court of New Brunswick ruled that the provincial taxation statute was unconstitutional, because it intruded on federal jurisdiction over inter-jurisdictional railways. The supporters of the railway measure appealed the case to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire. The Judicial Committee, in the case of Dow v Black, allowed the appeal and held that the taxation statute was within provincial authority.

===Downtown gutted by fire (1877)===
In 1877, St. Stephen&#x27;s business district was almost destroyed by fire when eighty buildings and 13 wharves burned.

=== Economy of the 20th century ===

Prior to World War II, St. Stephen&#x27;s local economy was heavily based in the lumber and ship building industry. At the end of the 18th century, there were no less than one hundred various dry docks and slips along the river, shared by the cities of Calais and St. Stephen. Prominent families in the area, such as the Merchies and the Todds, ran much of the town&#x27;s economy due to the monopoly they had on the St. Croix River system. Lumbering companies were located along both the Canadian and American sides of the river, each branding its logs with a unique symbol. By the early 1900s, 200 ships had been built in the St. Croix waters.
However, by the end of World War II the town&#x27;s main employers were Ganong Bros. Limited, Canada&#x27;s oldest candy company, established 1873, and the St. Croix Cotton Mill, Canada&#x27;s second largest textile mill, with 20,000 spindles, opening its doors in June 1882 and operating its own hydro-electric generating station, the Milltown Dam. Until recently, electricity generated by the Milltown Dam was exported to the United States, connected to a 69kV transmission circuit owned by the Eastern Maine Electric Cooperative, an electric utility serving Calais. In 1957, the textile mill closed, and it was demolished in 1972. At one time, the St. Croix Cotton Mill employed as many as 1200 persons at peak periods. Ganong remains a key employer.

Circa 1866, the Douglas Axe Manufacturing Company built their factory on Dennis Stream. In 1883, it was purchased by E. Broad &amp; Sons, who operated the company until 1895 when a new company was formed under the name of St. Stephen Edge Tool Co. In 1911, Harry Broad formed the Mann Axe &amp; Tool Co. with Charles Heustis as president and manager. With two storeys of the original factory now in use, they acquired the buildings of the Bug Death Chemical Co. On 29 January 1915, the St. Croix Water Power Company and the Sprague&#x27;s Falls Manufacturing Company Limited petitioned for approval of a dam and power canal and the obstruction, diversion, and use of the waters of the St. Croix River at Grand Falls. The state of Maine and the province of New Brunswick both decided on this matter, as it would affect both communities equally. The decision was made 9 November 1915. The new factory began operation in 1922. The factory was water powered from Dennis Stream and the original Hercules water turbine was still in use. In 1930, the factory became a victim of the Great Depression. It managed to continue operating until 1943, at which time the business finally closed.

===Municipal amalgamation (1970s)===
In the 1970s, the municipalities of St. Stephen and Milltown joined together to become what is now simply known as St. Stephen. For a short time, the town was called St. Stephen-Milltown, but the new name, not having caught on, reverted to simply the Town of St. Stephen. For official use, however, it is called the Town of St.Stephen-Milltown as written agreement stated at amalgamation in 1973.

=== Chocolate Festival ===
Every August since 1985, the town hosts a week-long Chocolate Fest, celebrating their rich and delicious heritage. The festival mascots are the Great Chocolate Mousse and Tiffany, his wife. The spotlight on the wonder of chocolate resulted in the opening of The Chocolate Museum in 1999 and its expansion in 2009. In 2000, St. Stephen was given the title of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Chocolate Town.&quot;

=== December 2010 flood ===

On 13 December 2010, a rainstorm caused a flood upstream on a tributary to Dennis Stream. This created hardship to the businesses that were located on or near King Street. The flood caused many layoffs, and Sobeys eventually closed down. The problem was due to the replacement of a trestle bridge in Dennis Stream with culvert pipes.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, St. Stephen had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

===Language===
==Climate==
The climate is temperate but it is greatly affected by the size of the Bay of Fundy. The Bay is a cool body of water which acts as an air conditioner in the summer and diverts major snow storms in the winter. The Bay never freezes. The average summer temperature is 22 °C with the average winter temperature being -3.9 °C.

Environment Canada maintains a testing program for water quality at the Milltown Dam generating station.

==International border==

The St. Croix River marks a section of the international boundary between the United States and Canada, forming a natural border between the towns on either side of the river bank. This section of the river and the land surrounding it was fought over heavily by both the French and the English during the 1600s, both sides believing the river lands should be part of their territory. Later, the river was used as a boundary between the United States and Canada, and many believed the line between the two countries should be drawn down the middle of the river itself. However, there were still many smaller branches to the river and various islands that were not spoken for and did not decidedly belong to one country or another.

The government dock, which is more like a small pier, is subject to a tide, and the marine trade is minute for this reason. Calais is connected to St. Stephen by the Ferry Point International Bridge, Milltown International Bridge and the newest bridge at the International Avenue Border Crossing, which began construction in 2008 and officially opened January 2010.

Until it was discontinued, passenger rail service was once housed in St. Stephen at the Canadian Pacific Railway station. The building is now home to the 5 Kings Picaroon&#x27;s Brew Pub and the spur line was decommissioned and turned into the Riverfront Walking Trail.

Woodland Rail operates a spur line between its pulp and paper plant in Baileyville, Maine and St. Stephen, where the New Brunswick Southern Railway takes Woodland freight to Saint John for wider distribution.

A lawsuit, Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited, which ended in 1954, pitted the American owner of an intercity bus company against a Canadian company, for the right to pick up and drop off passengers on the route from Saint John to Bangor, Maine. The right of the American party was upheld. Acadian Lines bus service was discontinued due to low ticket sales in 2011.

Residents of St. Stephen and Calais often regard their community as one place, cooperating in their fire departments and other community projects. For much of their history, both towns&#x27; fire departments have responded in tandem to any fire call on either side of the border. The longtime friendship between the towns was evident during the War of 1812 when the British military provided St. Stephen with a large supply of gunpowder for protection against the enemy Americans in Calais and the town elders gave the gunpowder to Calais for its Fourth of July celebrations.

Every year, St. Stephen and Calais co-host a weeklong International Festival to celebrate their continued friendship.

==Economy==
The Ganong Bros. Company continues to be the town&#x27;s most significant employer. Other employers with factories are located along Progress Avenue, and include flakeboard and resin manufacture, a machine shop, a bottler, a marine environmental remediation business, and a cannabis products manufacturer. The town has a wide variety of small businesses, a list of which can be found in the local business directory.

St. Stephen has three media organizations: two radio stations and a newspaper. CHTD-FM, known as &quot;98.1 Charlotte FM&quot;, plays adult contemporary music and offers regular news updates. CJRI-FM broadcasts from Fredericton studios and operates a St. Stephen transmitter at 99.9 on the FM dial, offering a southern gospel music format along with Canadian news, weather and sports. Founded in 1865, the &quot;Saint Croix Courier&quot; is the town&#x27;s weekly newspaper, and also publishes a weekend edition, the &quot;Courier Weekend&quot;. The &quot;Courier&quot; is one of the few papers in New Brunswick that is not owned by the Irving family.

St. Stephen has a number of elementary and two secondary schools, a public library, several churches, two museums, two community swimming pools, an enclosed hockey arena, a number of retirement homes, and a 44-bed hospital. St. Andrews, some 30 km distant, was the county seat until the county system was replaced in the 1960s, and thus was the location for the courthouse and gaol for the region, until the courthouse moved to St Stephen. In 2015, the province proposed to remove those functions entirely to Saint John.

St. Stephen can be described as government town, with large offices for federal government services such as Canada Post and Canada Border Services Agency, provincial government services such as Service New Brunswick, and municipal government services such as Solid Waste and Zoning.

==Education==
Education in St. Stephen includes 4 public schools and 1 private school:
*Milltown Elementary School (K-5)
*St. Stephen Elementary School (K-5)
*St. Stephen Middle School (6-8)
*St. Stephen High School (9-12)

The town is also home to St. Stephen&#x27;s University, a small private Christian university.

==Sports==
Basketball appeared in St. Stephen in 1891, introduced by Lyman Archibald at the local Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association, and continued by J. Howard Crocker. In the early 1890s, Crocker organized the annual track and field meets on Victoria Day at the local horse racing track.

A hotbed of baseball interest, in 1934, St. Stephen hosted the Boston Braves of baseball&#x27;s National League for an exhibition game against the local &quot;Kiwanis&quot; team, which was attended by half the town. In 1939, the local baseball team won its ninth consecutive New Brunswick senior championship, topping off a decade of dominance in the sport at both the provincial and Maritime levels.

The St. Stephen Aces compete in the Maritime Junior A Hockey League but were dissolved in 2019.

A building which housed the former Parsons Printing business suffered fire damage in May 2010. This building housed the first basketball court in Canada, which is currently being restored.

==Transportation==
St. Stephen is served by Route 1 and Route 170, which runs through town along King Street and Milltown Blvd. U.S. Route 1 serves connects to the Ferry Point Bridge from Main Street, Calais, Maine.

<text>A smoke detector is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indicator of fire. Smoke detectors/alarms are usually housed in plastic enclosures, typically shaped like a disk about in diameter and thick, but shape and size vary. Smoke can be detected either optically (photoelectric) or by physical process (ionization). Detectors may use one or both sensing methods. Sensitive detectors can be used to detect and deter smoking in banned areas. Smoke detectors in large commercial and industrial buildings are usually connected to a central fire alarm system.

Household smoke detectors, also known as &quot;smoke alarms&quot;, generally issue an audible or visual alarm from the detector itself or several detectors if there are multiple devices interconnected. Household smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units to several interlinked units with battery backup. With interlinked units, if any unit detects smoke, alarms will trigger all of the units. This happens even if household power has gone out.

Residential smoke alarms are usually powered with a 9-volt battery, or by mains electricity. Some smoke alarms use a combination of the 2; usually using a battery as an extra power source in the event of an outage.

Commercial smoke detectors issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as part of a fire alarm system. Usually, an individual commercial smoke detector unit does not issue an alarm; some, however, have built-in sounders.

The risk of dying in a residential fire is cut in half in houses with working smoke detectors. The US National Fire Protection Association reports 0.53 deaths per 100 fires in homes with working smoke detectors compared to 1.18 deaths without (2009–2013).

== History ==
The first automatic electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, an associate of Thomas Edison. In 1902, George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s, Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger attempted to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected the gas entering the sensor to bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit of the instrument. However, his device did not achieve its purpose as small concentrations of gas did not affect the sensor&#x27;s conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Unlike poison gas, the smoke particles from his cigarette were able to alter the circuit&#x27;s current. Jaeger&#x27;s experiment was one of the developments that paved the way for the modern smoke detector. In 1939, Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism so that it was strong enough to activate an alarm.

In 1951, ionization smoke detectors were first sold in the United States. In the following years, they were used only in major commercial and industrial facilities due to their large size and high cost. In 1955, simple &quot;fire detectors&quot; for homes were developed, which detected high temperatures. In 1963, The United States Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC) granted the first license to distribute smoke detectors that used radioactive material. In 1965, the first low-cost smoke detector for domestic use was developed by Duane D. Pearsall and Stanley Bennett Peterson. It was an individual, replaceable, battery-powered unit that could be easily installed. The &quot;SmokeGard 700&quot; was beehive-shaped, fire-resistant, and made of steel. The company began mass-producing these units in 1975. Studies in the 1960s determined that smoke detectors respond to fires much faster than heat detectors.

The first single-station smoke detector was invented in 1970 and was brought out the next year. It was an ionization detector powered by a single 9-volt battery. It cost about and sold at a rate of a few hundred thousand units per year. Several developments in smoke detector technology occurred between 1971 and 1976, including the replacement of cold-cathode tubes with solid-state electronics. This greatly reduced the detectors&#x27; cost and size and made it possible to monitor battery life. The previous alarm horns which required special batteries were replaced with horns that were more energy-efficient and allowed the use of widely available batteries. These detectors could also function with smaller amounts of radioactive source material, and the sensing chamber and smoke detector enclosure were redesigned to make the operation more effective. The rechargeable batteries were often replaced by a pair of AA batteries along with a plastic shell encasing the detector.

The photoelectric (optical) smoke detector was invented by Donald Steele and Robert Emmark from Electro Signal Lab and patented in 1972.

In 1995, the 10-year-lithium-battery-powered smoke alarm was introduced.

== Design ==

Smoke can be detected using a photoelectric sensor or an ionization process. Fire without smoke can be detected by sensing carbon dioxide. Incomplete burning can be detected by sensing carbon monoxide.

=== Photoelectric === 


A photoelectric, or optical smoke detector, contains a source of infrared, visible, or ultraviolet light—typically an incandescent light bulb or light-emitting diode (LED)—a lens, and a photoelectric receiver—typically a photodiode. In spot-type detectors, all of these components are arranged inside a chamber where air, which may contain smoke from a nearby fire, flows. In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums, optical beam or projected-beam smoke detectors are used instead of a chamber within the unit: a wall-mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device or reflected to the receiver by a reflector. In some types, particularly optical beam types, the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the photosensor. The received light intensity will be reduced due to scattering from particulates of smoke, air-borne dust, or other substances; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold, potentially due to smoke.

In other types, typically chamber types, the light is not directed at the sensor, which is not illuminated in the absence of particles. If the air in the chamber contains particles (smoke or dust), the light is scattered and some of it reaches the sensor, triggering the alarm.

According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), &quot;photoelectric smoke detection is generally more responsive to fires that begin with a long period of smoldering&quot;. Studies by Texas A&amp;M and the NFPA cited by the City of Palo Alto, California state, &quot;Photoelectric alarms react slower to rapidly growing fires than ionization alarms, but laboratory and field tests have shown that photoelectric smoke alarms provide adequate warning for all types of fires and have been shown to be far less likely to be deactivated by occupants.&quot;

Although photoelectric alarms are highly effective at detecting smoldering fires and do provide adequate protection from flaming fires, fire safety experts and the NFPA recommend installing what are called combination alarms, which are alarms that either detect both heat and smoke or use both the ionization and photoelectric smoke sensing methods. Some combination alarms may also include a carbon monoxide detection capability.

The type and sensitivity of light source and photoelectric sensor and type of smoke chamber differ between manufacturers.

=== Ionization === 


An ionization smoke detector uses a radioisotope, typically americium-241, to ionize air; a difference due to smoke is detected and an alarm is generated. Ionization detectors are more sensitive to the flaming stage of fires than optical detectors, while optical detectors are more sensitive to fires in the early smouldering stage.

The smoke detector has two ionization chambers, one open to the air, and a reference chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The radioactive source emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers should be the same as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power. It sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers and sounds the alarm if and only if the power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The current drawn by an ionization smoke detector is low enough for a small battery used as a sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for years without the need for external wiring.

Ionization smoke detectors are usually less expensive to manufacture than optical detectors. Ionization detectors may be more prone than photoelectric detectors to false alarms triggered by non-hazardous events, and are much slower to respond to typical house fires.

==== Radiation ====

Americium-241 is an alpha emitter with a half-life of 432.6 years. Alpha particle radiation, as opposed to beta (electron) and gamma (electromagnetic) radiation, is used for two reasons: the alpha particles can ionize enough air to make a detectable current; and they have low penetrative power, meaning they will be stopped, safely, by the air or the plastic shell of the smoke detector. During the alpha decay, emits gamma radiation, but it is low-energy and therefore not considered a significant contributor to human exposure.

The amount of elemental americium-241 in ionization smoke detectors is small enough to be exempt from the regulations applied to larger deployments. A smoke detector contains about of radioactive element americium-241 (), corresponding to about 0.3 μg of the isotope. This provides sufficient ion current to detect smoke while producing a very low level of radiation outside the device. Some Russian-made smoke detectors, most notably the RID-6m and IDF-1m models, contain a small amount of plutonium (18 MBq), rather than the typical source, in the form of reactor-grade mixed with titanium dioxide onto a cylindrical alumina surface.

The amount of americium-241 contained in ionizing smoke detectors does not represent a significant radiological hazard. If the americium is left in the ionization chamber of the alarm, the radiological risk is insignificant because the chamber acts as a shield to the alpha radiation. A person would have to open the sealed chamber and ingest or inhale the americium for the dose to be comparable to natural background radiation. The radiation risk of exposure to an ionizing smoke detector operating normally is much smaller than natural background radiation.

==== Disposal ====
Disposal regulations and recommendations for ionization smoke detectors vary from region to region. The government of New South Wales, Australia considers it safe to discard up to 10 ionization smoke detectors in a batch with domestic rubbish. The U.S. EPA considers ionizing smoke detectors safe to dispose with household trash. Alternatively, smoke detectors can be returned to the manufacturer.

=== Performance differences ===
Photoelectric detectors and ionization detectors differ in their performance depending on the type of smoke generated by a fire.

A presentation by Siemens and the Canadian Fire Alarm Association reports that the ionization detector is the best at detecting incipient-stage fires with invisibly small particles, fast-flaming fires with smaller 0.01–0.4 micron particles, and dark or black smoke, while more modern photoelectric detectors are best at detecting slow-smouldering fires with larger 0.4–10.0 micron particles, and light-coloured white/grey smoke.

Photoelectric smoke detectors respond faster to fire that is in its early, smoldering stage. The smoke from the smoldering stage of a fire is typically made up of large combustion particles between 0.3 and 10.0 μm. Ionization smoke detectors respond faster (typically 30–60 seconds) to the flaming stage of a fire. The smoke from the flaming stage of a fire is typically made up of microscopic combustion particles between 0.01 and 0.3 μm. Also, ionization detectors are weaker in high airflow environments.

Some European countries, including France, and some US states and municipalities have banned the use of domestic ionization smoke alarms because of concerns that they are not reliable enough as compared to other technologies. Where an ionizing smoke detector has been the only detector, fires in the early stages have not always been effectively detected.

In June 2006, the Australian Fire &amp; Emergency Service Authorities Council, the peak representative body for all Australian and New Zealand fire departments, published an official report, &#x27;Position on Smoke Alarms in Residential Accommodation&#x27;. Clause 3.0 states, &quot;Ionization smoke alarms may not operate in time to alert occupants to escape from a smoldering fire.&quot;

In August 2008, the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) passed a resolution recommending the use of photoelectric smoke alarms, saying that changing to photoelectric alarms &quot;Will drastically reduce the loss of life among citizens and firefighters.&quot;

In May 2011, the Fire Protection Association of Australia&#x27;s (FPAA) official position on smoke alarms stated, &quot;The Fire Prevention Association of Australia considers that all residential buildings should be fitted with photoelectric smoke alarms...&quot;

In December 2011, the Volunteer Firefighter&#x27;s Association of Australia published a World Fire Safety Foundation report, &quot;Ionization Smoke Alarms are DEADLY&quot;, citing research outlining substantial performance differences between ionization and photoelectric technology.

In November 2013, the Ohio Fire Chiefs&#x27; Association (OFCA) published a position paper supporting the use of photoelectric technology in Ohioan residences. The OFCA&#x27;s position states, &quot;In the interest of public safety and to protect the public from the deadly effects of smoke and fire, the Ohio Fire Chiefs&#x27; Association endorses the use of photoelectric smoke alarms in both new construction and when replacing old smoke alarms or purchasing new alarms.&quot;

In June 2014, tests by the Northeastern Ohio Fire Prevention Association (NEOFPA) on residential smoke alarms were broadcast on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; program. The NEOFPA tests showed ionization smoke alarms were failing to activate in the early, smoldering stage of a fire. The combination ionization/photoelectric alarms failed to activate for an average of over 20 minutes after the stand-alone photoelectric smoke alarms. This vindicated the June 2006 official position of the Australasian Fire &amp; Emergency Service Authorities Council (AFAC) and the October 2008 official position of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). Both the AFAC and the IAFF recommend photoelectric smoke alarms, but not combination ionization/photoelectric smoke alarms.

According to fire tests conformant to EN 54, the cloud from open fire can usually be detected before particulates.

Due to the varying levels of detection capabilities between detector types, manufacturers have designed multi-criteria devices which cross-reference the separate signals to both rule out false alarms and improve response times to real fires.

 is a unit of measurement that has become the standard way of specifying smoke detectors&#x27; sensitivity. Obscuration is the effect smoke has in reducing light intensity, expressed in percent absorption per unit length; higher concentrations of smoke result in higher obscuration levels.

=== Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide detection ===
Carbon monoxide sensors detect potentially fatal concentrations of carbon monoxide, which may build up due to faulty ventilation where there are combustion appliances such as gas heaters and cookers, although there is no uncontrolled fire outside the appliance.

High levels of carbon dioxide () may indicate a fire, and can be detected by a carbon dioxide sensor. Such sensors are often used to measure levels of which may be undesirable and harmful, but not indicative of a fire. This type of sensor can also be used to detect and warn of the much higher levels of generated by a fire. Some manufacturers say that detectors based on levels are the fastest fire indicators. Unlike ionization and optical detectors, they can also detect fires that do not generate smoke, such as those fueled by alcohol or gasoline. detectors are not susceptible to false alarms due to particles making them particularly suitable for use in dusty and dirty environments.

==Residential==
Smoke alarm systems used in a home or residential environment are typically smaller and less expensive than commercial units. The system may include one or more individual standalone units, or multiple, interconnected units. They typically generate a loud acoustic warning signal as their only action. Several detectors (whether standalone or interconnected) are normally used in the rooms of a dwelling. There are inexpensive smoke alarms that may be interconnected so that any detector triggers all alarms. They are powered by mains electricity, with disposable or rechargeable battery backup. They may be interconnected by wires, or wirelessly. They are required in new installations in some jurisdictions.

Several smoke detection methods are used and documented in industry specifications published by Underwriters Laboratories. Alerting methods include:

* Audible tones
** Varies between 2,900 and 3,500 Hz depending on brand and model name
** 95 dB loudness at 3 ft, can vary between brands and models.
* Spoken voice alert
* Visual strobe lights
** 177 candela output
* Emergency light for illumination
* Tactile stimulation (e.g. bed or pillow shaker), although no standards existed as of 2008 for tactile stimulation alarm devices

Some models have a hush or temporary silence feature that allows silencing, typically by pressing a button on the housing, without removing the battery. This is especially useful in locations where false alarms can be relatively common (e.g. near a kitchen), or situations where users might remove the battery permanently to avoid the annoyance of false alarms, preventing the alarm from detecting a fire should one break out.

While current technology is very effective at detecting smoke and fire conditions, the deaf and hard-of-hearing community has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the alerting function in awakening sleeping individuals in certain high-risk groups. People part of groups like the elderly, those with hearing loss, and those who are intoxicated, may have a more difficult time using sound-based detectors. Between 2005 and 2007, research sponsored by the United States National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) focused on understanding the cause of the higher number of deaths in such high-risk groups. Initial research into the effectiveness of the various alerting methods is sparse. Research findings suggest that a mid-frequency (520 Hz) square wave output is significantly more effective at awakening high-risk individuals. Wireless smoke and carbon monoxide detectors linked to alert mechanisms such as vibrating pillow pads for the hearing impaired, strobes, and remote warning handsets are more effective at waking people with serious hearing loss than other alarms.

=== Batteries ===

Batteries are used either as sole or as backup power for residential smoke detectors. Mains-operated detectors have disposable or rechargeable batteries; others run only on 9-volt disposable batteries. When the battery is exhausted, a battery-only smoke detector becomes inactive; most smoke detectors chirp repeatedly if the battery is low in power. It has been found that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated that in the UK, over 30% of smoke alarms have dead or removed batteries. In response public information campaigns have been created to remind people to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on April Fools&#x27; Day every year. In regions using daylight saving time, campaigns may suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clocks or on a birthday.

Some mains-powered detectors are fitted with a non-rechargeable lithium battery for backup with a life of typically ten years. After this, it is recommended that the detector be replaced. User-replaceable disposable 9-volt lithium batteries, which last at least twice as long as alkaline batteries, are also available for smoke detectors.

The US National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends that homeowners replace smoke detector batteries at least once per year when they start chirping (a signal that the battery is low on power output). Batteries should also be replaced when or if they fail a test, which the NFPA recommends to be carried out at least once per month by pressing the &quot;test&quot; button on the alarm.

=== Reliability ===
A 2004 NIST report concluded that &quot;Smoke alarms of either the ionization type or the photoelectric type consistently provided time for occupants to escape from most residential fires,&quot; and, &quot;Consistent with prior findings, ionization type alarms provided somewhat better response to flaming fires than photoelectric alarms (57 to 62 seconds faster response), and photoelectric alarms provided (often) considerably faster response to smoldering fires than ionization type alarms (47 to 53 minutes faster response).&quot;

Regular cleaning can prevent false alarms caused by the build-up of dust and insects, particularly on optical-type alarms as they are more susceptible to these factors. A vacuum cleaner can be used to clean domestic smoke detectors to remove detrimental dust. Optical detectors are less susceptible to false alarms in locations such as near a kitchen producing cooking fumes.

On the night of May 31, 2001, Bill Hackert and his daughter Christine of Rotterdam, New York, died when their house caught fire and a First Alert brand ionization smoke detector failed to sound. The cause of the fire was a frayed electrical cord behind a couch that smoldered for hours before engulfing the house with flames and smoke. The ionization smoke detector was found to be defectively designed, and in 2006 a jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York decided that First Alert, and its then parent company, BRK Brands, was liable for millions of dollars in damages.

=== Installation and placement ===
In the United States most state and local laws regarding the required number and placement of smoke detectors are based upon standards established in NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. Laws governing the installation of smoke detectors vary depending on the locality. However, some rules and guidelines for existing homes are relatively consistent throughout the developed world. For example, Canada and Australia require a building to have a working smoke detector on every level. The United States NFPA code, cited earlier, requires smoke detectors on every habitable level and within the vicinity of all bedrooms. Habitable levels include attics that are tall enough to allow access. Many other countries have comparable requirements.

In new construction, minimum requirements are typically more stringent. For example, all smoke detectors must be hooked directly to the electrical wiring, be interconnected and have a battery backup. In addition, typically, smoke detectors are required either inside or outside every bedroom, depending on local codes. Smoke detectors on the outside will detect fires more quickly, assuming the fire does not begin in the bedroom, but the sound of the alarm will be reduced and may not wake some people. Some areas also require smoke detectors in stairways, main hallways and garages.

A dozen or more detectors may be connected via wiring or wirelessly such that if one detects smoke, the alarms will sound on all the detectors in the network, improving the likelihood that occupants will be alerted even if smoke is detected far from their location. Wired interconnection is more practical in new construction than for existing buildings.

In the UK, the installation of smoke alarms in new builds must comply with British Standard BS5839 pt6. BS 5839: Pt.6: 2004, which recommends that a new-build property consisting of no more than 3 floors (less than 200 square metres per floor) should be fitted with a Grade D, LD2 system. Building Regulations in England, Wales and Scotland recommend that BS 5839: Pt.6 should be followed, but as a minimum a Grade D, LD3 system should be installed. Building Regulations in Northern Ireland require a Grade D, LD2 system to be installed, with smoke alarms fitted in the escape routes and the main living room and a heat alarm in the kitchen; this standard also requires all detectors to have a mains supply and a battery backup.

== Commercial ==
Commercial smoke detectors are either conventional or addressable, and are connected to security alarm or fire alarm systems controlled by fire alarm control panels (FACP). These are the most common type of detector and are usually significantly more expensive than single-station battery-operated residential smoke alarms. They are used in most commercial and industrial facilities and other places such as ships and trains, but are also part of some security alarm systems in homes. These detectors do not need to have built-in alarms, as alarm systems can be controlled by the connected FACP, which will set off relevant alarms, and can also implement complex functions such as a staged evacuation.

=== Conventional ===
The word &quot;conventional&quot; is slang used to distinguish the method used to communicate with the control unit in newer addressable systems. So-called &quot;conventional detectors&quot; are smoke detectors used in older interconnected systems and resemble electrical switches by their way of working. These detectors are connected in parallel to the signaling path so that the current flow is monitored to indicate a closure of the circuit path by any connected detector when smoke or other similar environmental stimuli sufficiently influences any detector. The resulting increase in current flow (or a dead short) is interpreted and processed by the control unit as a confirmation of the presence of smoke and a fire alarm signal is generated. In a conventional system, smoke detectors are typically wired together in each zone and a single fire alarm control panel usually monitors several zones which can be arranged to correspond to different areas of a building. In the event of a fire, the control panel can identify which zone or zones contain the detector or detectors in alarm. However, they cannot identify which individual detector or detectors are in a state of alarm.

=== Addressable ===

An addressable system gives each detector an individual number or address. Addressable systems allow the exact location of an alarm to be plotted on the FACP while allowing several detectors to be connected to the same zone. In certain systems, a graphical representation of the building is provided on the screen of the FACP which shows the locations of all of the detectors in the building, while in others the address and location of the detector or detectors in alarm are simply indicated.

Addressable systems are usually more expensive than conventional non-addressable systems, and offer extra options, including a custom level of sensitivity (sometimes called Day/Night mode) which can determine the amount of smoke in a given area and contamination detection from the FACP that allows determination of a wide range of faults in detection capabilities of smoke detectors. Detectors become contaminated usually as a result of the build-up of atmospheric particulates in the detectors being circulated by the heating and air-conditioning systems in buildings. Other causes include carpentry, sanding, painting, and smoke in the event of a fire. Panels can also be interconnected to monitor a large number of detectors in multiple buildings. This is most commonly used in hospitals, universities, resorts and other large centres or institutions.

== Standards ==

=== EN54 European standards ===
Fire detection products have the European Standard &quot;EN 54 Fire Detection and Fire Alarm Systems&quot; that is a mandatory standard for every product that is going to be delivered and installed in any country in the European Union (EU). &quot;EN 54 part 7&quot; is the standard for smoke detectors. European standards are developed to allow free movement of goods in the EU countries. EN 54 is widely recognized around the world. The EN 54 certification of each device must be issued annually.

====Coverage of smoke and temperature detectors with European standard EN54====
* EN54-7: Smoke detector
* EN54-5: Temperature detector
* SA: Surface area
* Smax (square meters): Maximum surface coverage
* Rmax (m): Maximum radio

Information that is in bold is the standard coverage of the detector. Smoke detector coverage is 60 square meters and temperature smoke detector coverage is 20 square meters. The height from the ground is an important issue for correct protection.

An additional (harmonised) EN14604 also exists, which tends to be the standard usually cited at the domestic point of sale. This standard expands on the EN54 recommendations for domestic smoke alarms and specifies requirements, test methods, performance criteria, and manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. It also includes additional requirements for smoke alarms, which are suitable for use in leisure accommodation vehicles. However, much of EN14604 is voluntary. A study published in 2014 assessed six areas of compliance and found that 33% of devices claiming to meet this standard did not do so in one or more of the specifics. The study also found 19% of the products to have a problem with actual fire detection.

=== Australia and United States ===
In the United States, the first standard for home smoke alarms was established in 1967. In 1969, the USAEC allowed homeowners to use smoke detectors without a license. The Life Safety Code (NFPA 101), passed by the US National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) in 1976, first required smoke alarms in homes. Smoke alarm sensitivity requirements in UL 217 were modified in 1985 to reduce susceptibility to nuisance alarms. In 1988 BOCA, ICBO, and SBCCI model building codes begin requiring smoke alarms to be interconnected and located in all sleeping rooms. In 1989 NFPA 74 first required smoke alarms to be interconnected in every new home construction, and 1993 NFPA 72 first required that smoke alarms be installed in all bedrooms. The NFPA began requiring the replacement of smoke detectors after ten years in 1999. In 1999, the Underwriters Laboratory (UL) changed smoke alarm labeling requirements so that all smoke alarms must have a manufactured date written in plain English.

In June 2013, a World Fire Safety Foundation report titled, &#x27;Can Australian and U.S. Smoke Alarm Standards be Trusted?&#x27; was published in the official magazine of the Australian Volunteer Firefighter Association. The report brings into question the validity of testing criteria used by American and Australian government agencies when undergoing scientific testing of ionization smoke alarms.

== Legislation ==
In June 2010 the City of Albany, California, enacted a photoelectric-only legislation after a unanimous decision by the Albany City Council; several other Californian and Ohioan cities enacted similar legislation shortly afterwards.

In November 2011, the Northern Territory enacted Australia&#x27;s first residential photoelectric legislation mandating the use of photoelectric smoke alarms in all new Northern Territory homes.

From January 1, 2017, the Australian state of Queensland mandated all smoke alarms in new dwellings (or where a dwelling is substantially renovated) must be photoelectric, and not also contain an ionization sensor. They also were to be hardwired to the mains power supply with a secondary power source (i.e. battery) and be interconnected with every other smoke alarm in the dwelling. This is so all would be activated together. From that date, all replacement smoke alarms must be photoelectric; from January 1, 2022, all dwellings sold, leased, or where a lease is renewed must comply as for new dwellings; and from January 1, 2027, all dwellings must comply as for new dwellings.

In June 2013, in an Australian Parliamentary speech, the question was asked, &quot;Are ionization smoke alarms defective?&quot; This was further to the Australian Government&#x27;s scientific testing agency (the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation – CSIRO) data revealing serious performance problems with ionization technology in the early, smoldering stage of a fire, a rise in litigation involving ionization smoke alarms, and increasing legislation mandating the installation of photoelectric smoke alarms. The speech cited in May 2013, World Fire Safety Foundation report published in the Australian Volunteer Firefighter Association&#x27;s magazine titled, &#x27;Can Australian and U.S. Smoke Alarm Standards be Trusted?&#x27; The speech concluded with a request for one of the world&#x27;s largest ionization smoke alarm manufacturers and the CSIRO to disclose the level of visible smoke required to trigger the manufacturers&#x27; ionization smoke alarms under CSIRO scientific testing. The US state of California banned the sale of smoke detectors with replaceable batteries.

== Privacy concerns regarding smart smoke detectors ==
Smart smoke detectors, like other Internet of things devices, can collect and transmit a significant amount of data. This can include data about when and where the device is used, the frequency of alarms, and even audio and video data if the device includes a microphone or camera. This data can potentially infer sensitive information about a user&#x27;s habits, routines, and lifestyle. Since smart smoke detectors are connected to the internet, they are vulnerable to hacking. An unauthorized person could potentially access the device and the data it collects. In extreme cases, if the device includes a camera or microphone, a hacker could use it to spy on the home&#x27;s inhabitants.

Many smart device manufacturers share user data with third parties, often for advertising or data analysis purposes. This can be a significant privacy concern if the data includes sensitive or personally identifiable information. Some manufacturers may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies, potentially providing them with access to users&#x27; data without their knowledge or consent.

Many users have taken steps to protect their privacy when using smart smoke detectors. This can include using strong, unique passwords for their devices, disabling unnecessary features, and regularly updating device software to protect against security vulnerabilities. Some users may also choose to use traditional smoke detectors that do not connect to the internet, to completely avoid these privacy concerns.

<text>Christopher David Moyles (born 22 February 1974) is an English radio and television presenter, author and presenter of &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; on Radio X.

Previously he presented &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1 from 2004 to 2012 and &quot;Chris Moyles&#x27; Quiz Night&quot; from 2009 to 2012 on Channel 4.
Moyles worked at various radio stations, including Radio Luxembourg (under the pseudonym Chris Holmes) and Capital FM. Moyles moved to BBC Radio 1 in July 1997 and left the station in September 2012. He has presented the early breakfast show, a Saturday morning show, and the drive time show (from September 1998 to December 2003), before presenting the breakfast show from 5 January 2004 to 14 September 2012. Moyles is BBC Radio 1&#x27;s longest serving breakfast presenter. Moyles became famous for his maverick bad-boy broadcasting style on BBC Radio 1 and was embroiled in numerous controversies, including accusations of sexism and homophobia, due to statements he made on the air and in the press.

==Early life and career==
Moyles was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, to Christopher, a postman, and housewife Hannah Veronica &quot;Vera&quot; Moyles, (from Dublin) and he was educated at Mount St Mary&#x27;s Catholic High School. While at school, he began his broadcasting career at WBHS (Wakefield&#x27;s Broadcast to Hospitals Service), a voluntary staffed hospital radio station in the West Yorkshire city.

After WBHS, Moyles moved to local radio station Aire FM as an assistant for DJ Carl Kingston. During this time, he was also a presenter on Radio Top Shop in the Leeds Briggate branch. After hosting his own &quot;Saturday Evening Show&quot; on Aire FM (and occasionally serving as a stand-in presenter), he was then employed as a presenter at Radio Luxembourg in 1992, until the station closed.

In 1993, he gained a job at the Pulse of West Yorkshire, presenting the evening show from 7.00 pm–10.00 pm. He remained there until early 1994 when he was dismissed for comments made about the station&#x27;s previous programme controller. Moyles subsequently joined Signal 1 in Stoke-on-Trent – again presenting &quot;The Evening Bit&quot; from 7.00 pm–10.00 pm. He remained there until he was dismissed by the station&#x27;s programme controller, who he refers to as a &quot;spineless bastard&quot; in his first autobiography. In 1995 Moyles was heard on the Chiltern Radio Network, presenting the evening show from 7.00 pm–10.00 pm, before taking on the late show from 10.00 pm–1.00 am. This show was simulcast on Horizon Radio, Chiltern Radio, Severn Sound and Northants 96.

In 1996, Moyles joined London station Capital FM, hosting his weekend show &quot;The Late Bit&quot;, which went out on Friday and Saturday evenings, and covering for other DJs. It was at Capital that Moyles fell out with fellow DJ Neil Fox. After declining the offer of presenting the breakfast show on rival station Kiss 100, Moyles joined Radio 1 in July 1997.

==Radio 1==
Moyles was voted one of the Faces for 97 by &quot;SKY magazine&quot; and presented his first show on Radio 1 on 28 July 1997, hosting the 4.00 am–7.00 am Early Breakfast show – soon called &quot;The Early Bit&quot;. In May 1998, his work was recognised with the award of the Silver Sony Awards DJ of the Year, and he was styling himself as &#x27;The Saviour of Early Morning Radio&#x27;. Within the year Moyles was promoted to a Saturday breakfast, then Saturday mid-morning slot from 10.00 am–1.00 pm. At Radio 1, he presented most of his shows with David &quot;Comedy Dave&quot; Vitty, who worked behind the scenes at the station before Moyles&#x27; arrival.

After standing in regularly for Kevin Greening and Zoe Ball on the &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot;, Moyles&#x27; next promotion came in October 1998 when he took control of the drivetime show from 4.00 pm–5:45 pm. The show was extended to 3.00 pm–5:45 pm in February 2001. Moyles presented the show from 1998 with his sidekick.

On 5 January 2004, Moyles started presenting Radio 1&#x27;s breakfast programme, named &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot;, switching places with Sara Cox. He had been appointed to increase the ratings for the show and did so, putting on an extra 1,000,000 listeners to the audience in the first quarter of 2004. After a successful first year, Moyles was awarded &#x27;DJ of the Year&#x27; by readers of &quot;The Sun&quot;.

By 2005, Moyles and his team had succeeded in increasing the morning audience, with his programme&#x27;s audience rising to 6.5 million. This was coupled with an increase in the overall Radio 1 audience share. With 895,000 listeners in London in the third quarter of 2005, he succeeded in overtaking Johnny Vaughan to take the position of the capital&#x27;s most listened to youth breakfast show. Moyles&#x27; audience ratings continued to increase each week and led to him winning a gold Sony Radio Award in 2006 for best entertainment show.

With the release of the RAJAR listening figures on 3 August 2006, Moyles had added a further 470,000 listeners to the Breakfast Show, taking the average listenership up to 6.79 million. On 10 May 2007, RAJAR figures confirmed that Moyles had increased his listening figures to 7.06 million, breaking the seven million barrier for the first time with the station having 10.55 million listeners overall. Moyles again increased his audience to 7.72 million as of 1 May 2008 slightly narrowing the gap between him and Terry Wogan, the highest-rated radio show in the UK at the time. The station&#x27;s overall listener figure is now over 11 million.

On 12 May 2008 &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; won its second Sony radio gold award for &#x27;best breakfast show&#x27;. At this time he was given another half-hour on his show going from 7.00 am–10.00 am to 6.30 am–10.00 am.

On 7 September 2009 Moyles became the longest serving breakfast presenter on Radio 1, breaking the record previously set by Tony Blackburn.

In March 2011, Moyles and his colleague David Vitty beat the record for the longest continuous Radio 1 show, on Radio 1&#x27;s Longest Show Ever with Chris Moyles and Comedy Dave for Comic Relief. Between 16 and 18 March they beat both Simon Mayo&#x27;s 1999 record of 37 hours and the &#x27;Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team)&#x27; Guinness World Record by broadcasting for 52 hours for Comic Relief initially raising £2.4 million, and with an audience of 2.84 million, it was the most popular live BBC Red Button radio feature ever. The event raised a final total of £2,821,831.

On 1 July 2011, it was announced that Moyles would remain within the BBC until at least 2014, ending speculation that he would move to a commercial rival. The deal was estimated to be worth £1 million. This would have allowed the presenter to reach his 10-year anniversary on &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot;. However, on 11 July 2012, Moyles announced that he would be leaving the breakfast show and the station on 14 September. It was announced later the same day that Nick Grimshaw would replace him.

==Radio X==
On 7 September 2015, it was announced Chris Moyles would return to radio on the newly re-branded Radio X (previously XFM) hosting the new &quot;Chris Moyles Show&quot;. The show began airing on 21 September 2015 from 6.30 am–10.00 am, returning to his former breakfast slot and was going head to head with his BBC Radio 1 breakfast show replacement, Nick Grimshaw. Chris Moyles stated Dominic Byrne, who read the news on his BBC Radio 1 show, would return with him, as would producer Pippa Taylor. 
On 19 April 2016 it was announced that there would be an additional pre-recorded show on Saturday mornings between 8 am-11.00 am featuring clips from the week, interviews with studio guests plus new content, which means that Chris is on air on Radio X 6 days a week.

==Work outside radio==
===BT Red Nose Climb and Speaking Clock===
Moyles was one of a team of celebrities who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to raise money for Comic Relief, reaching the summit on 7 March 2009. He was joined by his show&#x27;s producers, Rachel Mallender and Pippa Taylor, and BBC Radio 1 controller, Andy Parfitt. Also on the climb were Girls Aloud members Cheryl Cole and Kimberley Walsh, Fearne Cotton, Ben Shephard, Gary Barlow, Ronan Keating, Denise Van Outen and Alesha Dixon. He recorded a parody song around this time to promote the climb, mentioning all the names of the people that were also taking part – it was based on Lily Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Fear&quot;, and was called &quot;(A month off of) The Beer&quot;.

From 3 February – 23 March 2009, Moyles was joined by Kimberley Walsh, Cheryl Cole, Gary Barlow, Ronan Keating, Ben Shephard and Fearne Cotton to help raise money for charity by reading the time on the Speaking Clock.

===Film voice work===
Moyles has provided his voice and/or likeness to a number of films and games. His face was used in &quot;24: The Game&quot;, and his voice can be heard in the films &quot;Wimbledon&quot;, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Robots&quot;. In some of these films, his voice was only used for the UK version.

===Television presenting===
Moyles has branched out his work into television. In 2002, his own Channel 5 show, &quot;Live with Chris Moyles&quot;, ran five shows a week for 13 weeks. Moyles was replaced by Christian O&#x27;Connell, before the programme was cancelled.

He and sidekick Dave Vitty had their own TV show, also entitled &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; like their former Radio 1 show, which was aired from 1998–99 on the now-defunct UK satellite and cable channel UK Play.

Moyles voiced the fourth and final series of Sky1 show &quot;The Villa&quot; and has occasionally presented &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. He has also worked for the Comic Relief and Children in Need charities on their telecasts.

Moyles has presented a number of episodes of &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Mouth&quot;. &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; journalist Rob Leigh once said of his &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Mouth&quot; presenting that &quot;Chris Moyles may be Marmite for the ears on radio but never quite nails it on TV, even with his relative star power&quot;. He also presented &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; on Channel 4 several times between 2000 and 2002.

Moyles launched a new show on Channel 4, called &quot;Chris Moyles&#x27; Quiz Night&quot; on 22 March 2009. The show consisted of Moyles alongside three other celebrities partaking in a traditional pub-style quiz. The original series had the four competing to win an item that belonged to Moyles but this has since developed into a more traditional quiz with the loser singing karaoke-style at the end of the show. The opening show received poor viewing figures attracting just 6% of total audience for the timeslot. It was continued for a second series between 26 February and 11 April 2010, a third series following between 1 November and 22 December 2010 and fourth between 15 July and 2 September 2011. After 5 series, the show was shelved.

On 24 October 2011, &quot;The Metro&quot; announced that Moyles would co-present a new dating show, &quot;The Love Machine&quot;, alongside Stacey Solomon for Sky. Moyles confirmed this on his radio show that morning.

===Other television appearances===
Moyles appeared on the ITV show &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot; and had minor success. He was voted out of the show on 4 June 2006 in the semi-final. Following this appearance, stories in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; both reported that Moyles was looking to relaunch his television career; rumours suggested that he had been offered his own show by ITV. Moyles has spoken of a desire to transfer the format of his radio show to the TV, but otherwise has thus far stayed clear of a conventional TV format.

Moyles regularly appears on &quot;This Morning&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot;.

Moyles played himself in an episode of the drama &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; which aired on 15 February 2007 and appeared on a celebrity version of &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; that broadcast on the same day. He has appeared as a guest on numerous British television shows, including the ninth series of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, &quot;Never Mind The Buzzcocks&quot;, which immortalised Moyles as an &quot;oily pig in a dunce hat&quot; &quot;The Charlotte Church Show&quot;, &quot;The F-Word&quot;, &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot;, &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; and &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;.

In 2008, Moyles appeared on the Brit Awards to present the award for the best live act, and appeared in the BBC documentary series &quot;Comedy Map of Britain&quot;. He has appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack&quot; TV programme as well as an appearance as a team captain on the Channel 4 show &quot;Alan Carr&#x27;s Celebrity Ding Dong&quot; and on 18 July 2008 he appeared on Jimmy Carr&#x27;s show on Channel 4, &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;.

On 23 February 2009, Moyles was the guest on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot; to promote the BT Red Nose climb of Mount Kilimanjaro. He appeared again on the show on 26 February 2010 to talk about and promote the second series of &quot;Chris Moyles&#x27; Quiz Night&quot;. In July 2009, he featured in an episode of the genealogy documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; on BBC One where he explored his Irish ancestry. He visited Ireland and Belgium, where his great-grandfather fought and died in the First World War. On the programme Moyles discovered that his surname means &quot;bald servant&quot; from the Irish &quot;Ó Maolmanach&quot;. He also co-presented Children in Need Rocks Manchester in November 2011. Moyles appeared on the quiz show &quot;The Million Pound Drop&quot; along with Andi Peters in February 2012, they won £25,000 to divide between their chosen charities.

Moyles appeared on Children in Need on 16 November 2012, performing &quot;Bring Me Sunshine&quot; on stage with holograms of comedy duo Morecambe and Wise in an effort to raise money for the charity.

On 31 October 2022 Moyles was announced by ITV as a campmate of the 2022 series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. On the promo video Moyles says &quot;It&#x27;s only three weeks in the middle of a jungle; What could possibly go wrong?&quot; He was voted out sixth on 24 November.

===Autobiography===
Moyles&#x27; autobiography, &quot;The Gospel according to Chris Moyles: The Story of One Man and His Mouth&quot; was released by Ebury Press on 5 October 2006.

On 4 October 2007 a follow-up book &quot;Chris Moyles: The Difficult Second Book&quot;, published by Ebury Press, was officially released. &quot;The Difficult Second Book&quot; was released in paperback on 1 May 2008. Stewart Lee, on his own programme &quot;Stewart Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle&quot;, commented that the title of the book suggests &quot;a degree of irony and self-awareness largely absent from the text itself&quot; and then went on to deconstruct and mock the book&#x27;s contents.

===Stage work===
On 16 May 2012 it was announced that Chris Moyles had been cast to play the part of King Herod in an arena tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical Jesus Christ Superstar. Moyles reprised his role as King Herod when Jesus Christ Superstar began another arena tour on 1 October 2013. Moyles also toured a solo stage show, &quot;Chris Moyles Live&quot;.

==Presenting style==
Moyles uses a zoo format, and therefore relies on his team members and audience participation for his show&#x27;s games and quizzes and for other sources of comedy. He is renowned for his boorish manner, quick temper, and put-downs. It is this approach which most commonly leads to criticism of Moyles. It has also caused him to become involved in numerous controversies related to perceived offensive statements. However, Moyles generally accepts counter attacks in the same manner and routinely derides himself for being overweight and so forth, often in the lyrics of jingles. Due to his fascination with radio, Moyles regularly discusses the process of making the show, often spoofing clichéd radio practices. Many of his show&#x27;s features are homages to or exaggerations of other radio features.

==Parody songs==

In December 2000, he parodied the Eminem song &quot;Stan&quot; that was No. 1 in the charts at the time, with a seasonal Christmas themed variation called &quot;Stanta&quot;, instead. It became one of the most popular requested parodies and was often played more than once during the course of a show.

In October 2004, Moyles and &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; team replaced U2&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; at number one in the UK Official Download Chart with their download-only charity song &quot;Dogz Don&#x27;t Kill People (Wabbitz Do)&quot;, under the name &#x27;Mouldie Lookin&#x27; Stain&#x27;. The song was a spoof of Goldie Lookin&#x27; Chain&#x27;s &quot;Guns Don&#x27;t Kill People Rappers Do&quot; (itself a spoof rap song) and proceeds went to Comic Relief. At the time of its release, it was the fastest selling download on UK charts.

Moyles has parodied several Kaiser Chiefs songs under the name &quot;The Kaiser Chefs&quot;. These include &quot;I Predict A Diet&quot; (Parody of I Predict a Riot) and &quot;Donny&quot; (Parody of Ruby). Chris and Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs (both Leeds United fans) said they had accidentally given Doncaster Rovers fans an unofficial anthem with &quot;Donny&quot; after Doncaster Rovers beat Leeds United 1–0 in the 2008 League One Play-off Final.

During the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Moyles organised a parody of England World Cup songs, to ridicule the number of songs there were out at the time. &quot;José – The Special One&quot; (a parody of &quot;Rosé&quot; by The Feeling was written on team manager José Mourinho&#x27;s departure from Chelsea and was banned after the club complained to the BBC (although subsequently played repeatedly on Moyles&#x27; show and on Radio 5 Live). He made a parody of &quot;We Have Got to Zero Baby&quot;, a take on Enrique Iglesias&#x27;s &quot;Hero&quot;, which describes how his football team, Leeds United, managed to claw back a 15-point deficit in League One in only 5 games. In November 2007, he used Hoosiers – &quot;Goodbye Mr A&quot; for &quot;Goodbye Mr. M&quot; where he sings about the England football manager Steve McClaren being sacked.

Often Moyles will pick a track because of the silliness of its lyrics, for instance &quot;Smile&quot; by Lily Allen was parodied by Moyles&#x27;s invention &quot;Silly Allen&quot;, in a song called &quot;Piles&quot; and Natasha Bedingfield&#x27;s &quot;I Wanna Have Your Babies&quot; written by Comedy Dave and performed in May 2007. In the same month, he performed a parody of Hellogoodbye&#x27;s hit &quot;Here&quot; called &quot;Beer in My Arms&quot; in which he describes how much he really dislikes the song, calling it &#x27;daft&#x27;. Moyles also covered Puretone &quot;Addicted to Bass&quot; with &quot;Addicted to Plaice&quot;, which covers the subject of being addicted to fish. In September 2007, he performed &quot;Suicidal&quot; a parody of the UK number one Sean Kingston&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;, in which he talks about how the song makes him feel suicidal and wonders why it reached number one.

Although of 2008, UK&#x27;s chart no.1 Basshunter was renamed &quot;Chuffhunter&quot; in which he mocks the song and those that would buy it, Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Bow Wow Wow&quot; and a re-write of the Estelle song &quot;American Boy&quot;, named &quot;Somerset Boy&quot;. In the past, he has parodied include Billie Piper&#x27;s &quot;Honey to the Bee&quot; as &quot;Guinness For Me&quot;, All Seeing Eye&#x27;s &quot;Walk Like a Panther&quot;, Will Smith&#x27;s &quot;Gettin Jiggy Wit It&quot;, and McFly&#x27;s &quot;All About You&quot; as &quot;He Don&#x27;t Use Shampoo&quot;. Moyles has also written Baked Beans, a parody of Same Jeans by The View, and &quot;Lunch in this Pub&quot;, originally the Usher single &quot;Love in this Club&quot;. One of his recent parodies, &quot;No Hair&quot; – sung by &quot;follicly-challenged&quot; newscaster Dominic Byrne – is a cover of Jordin Sparks&#x27;s &quot;No Air (ft Chris Brown)&quot;.

Another two of Moyles&#x27; recent parodies are &quot;Lorry Driver&quot; which is a cover of Britney Spears&#x27; song &quot;Womanizer&quot; and &quot;The Boy Does Plenty&quot; by &quot;Adrian Dixon&quot;, originally a song by Alesha Dixon, both of which are written by &#x27;Comedy Dave&#x27; Vitty.

In March 2009 Moyles released a parody song called &quot;Dreaming of Debbie McGee&quot;. The song was about a man who has recurring dreams of the assistant on &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot;. Comedy Dave wrote the song, and Paul Daniels asked for it to be made into an MP3 file after hearing it on air. It was a parody of the Kings of Leon song &quot;Revelry&quot;. In April 2009, McGee recorded a reply which was played on air and was a parody of the same song called Dreaming of Moylesy.

Moyles released &quot;Waterproof&quot; in July 2009, a parody of the La Roux song &quot;Bulletproof&quot;. This song has an approved record deal to be used on a parody album, should Chris wish to do so.

Moyles has released an album entitled &quot;The Parody Album&quot;. Recording began in September 2009, and the album was released on 23 November.

The official Moyles Parody Album game entitled Parody Island was released to help promote the album and allow players to hear snippets from his new album.

&quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; was credited with the debut of the unofficial England World Cup Song, written and performed by Chico Slimani a parody of his hit single &quot;It&#x27;s Chico Time&quot; and originally named &quot;It&#x27;s England Time&quot;. Slimani recorded the single after having a &#x27;vision&#x27; that England won the 2010 World Cup and that in the celebrations, commentators made reference to his song. The single debuted, Monday 8 February 2010.

==Personal life==
Moyles resides in Highgate, London with his girlfriend Tiffany Austin.

Moyles is a supporter of Leeds United F.C. and a critic of Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock.

==Controversies==
Moyles has been censured several times by the Broadcasting Standards Commission and Ofcom. This happened during his time at both Capital and Radio 1. For example, the regulatory bodies upheld complaints when Moyles threatened and bullied Neil Fox in October 2002 with the claim that &quot;I&#x27;m gonna tear his head off and poo down his neck&quot;; and also in early 2002, when he said &quot;he would take the virginity of Charlotte Church&quot;, when the child star reached sixteen.

When he first arrived at Radio 1, John Peel took an instant dislike to Moyles and accused him of being a &quot;DLT-in-waiting&quot;. Moyles retorted that Peel was a &quot;Kenny Everett-in-waiting, because Kenny Everett&#x27;s dead and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before John pops his clogs&quot;. In his biography Moyles said that he mended his relationship with Peel and felt a sense of loss that he had not got to know him before his death.

In September 2008, Moyles, along with other British radio presenters, was criticised for on-air promotion of drinking to excess.

===On-air profanity===
In February 2006, Moyles apologised, along with the BBC, after swearing when speaking to a caller live on air. He made the outburst while teasing a mother-of-three from Newcastle during an on-air feature which her children had interrupted. &quot;You&#x27;ve got three kids from some fuckin&#x27;...&quot; he blurted out, before apologising profusely for his mistake. The BBC issued six apologies, adding that such mistakes could occur during live broadcasts such as Moyles&#x27; show. The BBC was later cleared by broadcasting regulator Ofcom over the incident.

In July 2006, communications watchdog Ofcom found Moyles in Breach of rule 1.5 of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code Rules for an incident in which he referred to female listeners as &quot;dirty whores&quot;. A listener objected to an item in which the presenter discussed people who urinated in the shower. He considered that the presenter&#x27;s reference to women who did this as &quot;dirty whores&quot; was unacceptable at this time of the morning.

===Pay fracas===
Alongside a number of other Radio 1 and Radio 2 presenters, Moyles crossed a strike picket line in 2005. BBC staff were striking over recently announced job cuts. A report by the BBC Trust on 2 June 2008 revealed that Moyles was paid £630,000 in 2007.
Moyles revealed in September 2009 that he took a 20 per cent pay cut three months earlier, quoting the reason &quot;I want to work at the BBC, which is trying to save some of its gazillions&quot;.
On 22 September 2010 Moyles spoke out on air about not being paid by the BBC in two months.

===Accusations of homophobia===
Moyles was accused of homophobia in May 2006, when he rejected a ringtone by saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want that one, it&#x27;s gay&quot;, live on air. This led to a number of complaints to the BBC. They argued that the use of the word &quot;gay&quot; in this context was homophobic. The BBC governors said that Moyles was simply &quot;keeping up with developments in English usage&quot;.

The Programme Complaints Committee said that, &quot;The word &#x27;gay&#x27;, in addition to being used to mean &#x27;homosexual&#x27; or &#x27;carefree&#x27;, was often now used to mean &#x27;lame&#x27; or &#x27;rubbish&#x27;. In describing a ringtone as gay, the DJ was conveying that he thought it was &#x27;rubbish&#x27; rather than &#x27;homosexual&#x27;. Moyles was not being homophobic&quot;. The panel acknowledged that this use of the word &#x27;gay&#x27; in a derogatory sense could cause offence to some listeners and counselled caution on its use.

In June, LGBT charity Stonewall marched with placards demanding the dismissal of Moyles during Europride in London. According to Stonewall, &quot;Chris Moyles is not helping young LGBT people struggling to come out through his comments&quot;. Stonewall gave Moyles the award of &quot;Bully of the Year&quot; at their annual Stonewall Awards that same year.

Those defending Moyles have noted that Aled Haydn Jones, his show&#x27;s producer who has worked with Moyles since 2001, is openly gay. Moyles was quoted in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by Stonewall chief executive Ben Summerskill as saying &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m homophobic, I don&#x27;t like the gays. Sorry, it just does my head in. We have a token gay on the show!&quot; In his book &quot;The Difficult Second Book&quot;, Moyles says that he was responding to another article with sarcasm, and was subsequently quoted out of context.

Moyles was censured by Ofcom following eight complaints made after a broadcast on 20 January 2009 in which he told listeners it was the birthday of Will Young and then went on to sing &quot;Evergreen&quot; and &quot;Leave Right Now&quot; in a high pitched and effeminate voice, changing the lyrics to references to Young&#x27;s sexuality. Ofcom stated that the language used could have been &quot;interpreted by listeners as promoting and condoning certain negative stereotypes based on sexual orientation&quot; and whilst acknowledging the intention was to be humorous in their opinion it could have been perceived as &quot;hostile&quot; and &quot;pejorative&quot;. The media regulator also said in their view that because of the show&#x27;s breakfast time slot that attracts a young audience it &quot;had the potential to encourage children to discriminate against others&quot; based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation and &quot;ran the risk of being imitated on the playground&quot; causing &quot;unnecessary distress&quot;.

===Auschwitz comments===
On 20 January 2009, Moyles made comments on his radio show regarding the family history programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; and the Holocaust. Referring to his trips while filming the programme, Moyles said &quot;I went off to Ireland and other places to film and unlike a lot of the &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; shows I didn&#x27;t go to Auschwitz. Pretty much everyone goes there whether or not they&#x27;re Jewish. They just seem to pass through there on their way to Florida&quot;. Celebrities featured on &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; including Stephen Fry, Jerry Springer and Natasha Kaplinsky, have traced their family histories back to Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Second World War. The BBC released a statement: &quot;Anyone who listens to the Chris Moyles Show will know he has an irreverent style. However, we regret that on this occasion his comments were misjudged and we are speaking to Chris and his team about them&quot;.

===N-Dubz behaviour===
On 12 January 2010, hip-hop trio N-Dubz appeared on the &quot;Chris Moyles Show&quot; on Radio 1. The show received a text message from a female listener saying that band member Dappy was &quot;vile&quot; and &quot;a little boy with a silly hat&quot; and that N-Dubz were &quot;losers&quot;. Dappy secretly copied her phone number from the studio console and sent abusive and threatening text messages to the woman the following day including one telling her she was &quot;gonna die!&quot;. Moyles said of the resulting criticism: &quot;I feel let down by him, I&#x27;ve supported them and said, &#x27;Do you know what, N-Dubz aren&#x27;t just a bunch of dippy chavs, they&#x27;re really good&#x27;. So for him to go and do something like that is a bit rubbish&quot;.

===Tax avoidance===
In 2012 Chris Moyles was involved in a tax avoidance scheme and requested a court order to prevent the press from reporting it, because he claimed it would infringe his human rights.

<text>Martha Nussbaum (; Craven; born May 6, 1947) is an American philosopher and the current Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago, where she is jointly appointed in the law school and the philosophy department. 

Nussbaum&#x27;s work has focused on ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, political philosophy, existentialism, feminism, and ethics, including animal rights. She also holds associate appointments in classics, divinity, and political science, is a member of the Committee on Southern Asian Studies, and a board member of the Human Rights Program. She previously taught at Harvard and Brown.

She has written more than two dozen books, including &quot;The Fragility of Goodness&quot; (1986). She received the 2016 Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy, the 2018 Berggruen Prize, and the 2021 Holberg Prize. In recent years, she has also been considered a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Early life and education==
Nussbaum was born Martha Craven on May 6, 1947, in New York City, the daughter of George Craven, a Philadelphia lawyer, and Betty Warren, an interior designer and homemaker. During her teenage years, Nussbaum attended The Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr. She described her upbringing as &quot;East Coast WASP elite ... very sterile, very preoccupied with money and status&quot;. She would later credit her impatience with &quot;mandarin philosophers&quot; and dedication to public service as the &quot;repudiation of my own aristocratic upbringing. I don&#x27;t like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the Bloomsbury group or Derrida&quot;.

After studying at Wellesley College for two years, she dropped out to pursue theatre in New York. She studied theatre and classics at New York University, getting a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969, and gradually moved to philosophy while at Harvard University, where she received a Master of Arts degree in 1972 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1975, studying under G. E. L. Owen.

==Career==

In the 1970s and early 1980s she taught philosophy and classics at Harvard, where she was denied tenure by the Classics Department in 1982. Nussbaum then moved to Brown University, where she taught until 1995 when she joined the University of Chicago Law School faculty. Her 1986 book &quot;The Fragility of Goodness&quot;, on ancient Greek ethics and Greek tragedy, made her a well-known figure throughout the humanities. At Brown, Nussbaum&#x27;s students included philosopher Linda Martín Alcoff and actor and playwright Tim Blake Nelson. In 1987, she gained public attention due to her critique of fellow philosopher Allan Bloom&#x27;s &quot;The Closing of the American Mind.&quot; More recent work (&quot;Frontiers of Justice&quot;) establishes Nussbaum as a theorist of global justice. Nussbaum&#x27;s work on capabilities has often focused on the unequal freedoms and opportunities of women, and she has developed a distinctive type of feminism, drawing inspiration from the liberal tradition, but emphasizing that liberalism, at its best, entails radical rethinking of gender relations and relations within the family.

Nussbaum&#x27;s other major area of philosophical work is the emotions. She defended a &quot;neo-Stoic&quot; account of emotions that holds that they are appraisals that ascribe to things and persons, outside the agent&#x27;s own control, great significance for the person&#x27;s own flourishing. On this basis, she has proposed analyses of grief, compassion, and love, and, in a later book, of disgust and shame.

Nussbaum has engaged in debates with other intellectuals, in her academic writings as well as in the pages of semi-popular magazines and book reviews and, in one instance, when testifying as an expert witness in court. She testified in the Colorado bench trial for &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;, arguing against the claim that the history of philosophy provides the state with a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in favor of a law that sought to overturn local anti-discrimination laws. A portion of this testimony, dealing with the potential meanings of the term &quot;tolmêma&quot; in Plato&#x27;s work, was the subject of controversy, and was called misleading and even perjurious by critics.
 She responded to these charges in a lengthy article called &quot;Platonic Love and Colorado Law&quot;. Nussbaum used multiple references from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; and his interactions with Socrates as evidence for her argument. The debate continued with a reply by one of her sternest critics, Robert P. George.
Nussbaum has criticized Noam Chomsky as being among the leftist intellectuals who hold the belief that &quot;one should not criticize one&#x27;s friends, that solidarity is more important than ethical correctness&quot;. She suggests that one can &quot;trace this line to an old Marxist contempt for bourgeois ethics, but it is loathsome whatever its provenance&quot;. Among her academic colleagues whose books she has reviewed critically are Allan Bloom, Harvey Mansfield, and Judith Butler. Other academic debates have been with figures such as John Rawls, Richard Posner, and Susan Moller Okin. In January 2019, Nussbaum announced that she would be using a portion of her Berggruen Prize winnings to fund a series of roundtable discussions on controversial issues at the University of Chicago Law School. These discussions will be known as the Martha C. Nussbaum Student Roundtables.

=== Capabilities approach ===

Nussbaum is well known for her contributions in developing the capabilities approach to well-being, alongside Amartya Sen. The key question the capabilities approach asks is &quot;What is each person able to do and to be?&quot; As such, the approach looks at combined capabilities: an individual&#x27;s developable abilities (&quot;internal abilities&quot;), freedom, and opportunity. Here, &quot;freedom&quot; refers to the ability of a person to choose one life or another, and opportunity refers to social, political, and/or economic conditions that allow or disallow individual growth.

Nussbaum asserts that all humans (and non-human animals) have a basic right to dignity. To provide human dignity, she states that governments must provide &quot;at least a threshold level&quot; of the following capabilities: life; bodily health; bodily integrity; senses, imagination, and thought, emotions; practical reason; affiliation; other species; play; and control over one&#x27;s environment, including political and material environments.

==Personal life==
She was married to Alan Nussbaum from 1969 until they divorced in 1987, a period which also led to her conversion to Judaism and the birth of her daughter Rachel. Nussbaum&#x27;s interest in Judaism has continued and deepened: on August 16, 2008, she became a &quot;bat mitzvah&quot; in a service at Temple K. A. M. Isaiah Israel in Chicago&#x27;s Hyde Park, chanting from the &quot;Parashah Va-etchanan&quot; and the &quot;Haftarah Nahamu&quot;, and delivering a &quot;D&#x27;var Torah&quot; about the connection between genuine, non-narcissistic consolation and the pursuit of global justice. Nussbaum&#x27;s daughter Rachel died in 2019 due to a drug-resistant infection following successful transplant surgery. At the time of her death she was a government affairs attorney in the Wildlife Division of Friends of Animals, a nonprofit organization working for animal welfare. The two women had co-authored four articles about wild animals.

Nussbaum dated and lived with Cass Sunstein for more than a decade. They had been engaged to be married. She had previously had a romantic relationship with Amartya Sen.

==Major works==
===&quot;The Fragility of Goodness&quot;===
&quot;The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy&quot; confronts the ethical dilemma that individuals strongly committed to justice are nevertheless vulnerable to external factors that may deeply compromise or even negate their human flourishing. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks to determine the extent to which reason may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the Platonic notion that human goodness can fully protect against peril, siding with the tragic playwrights and Aristotle in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability as a key to realizing the human good.

Her interpretation of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; in particular drew considerable attention. Under Nussbaum&#x27;s consciousness of vulnerability, the re-entrance of Alcibiades at the end of the dialogue undermines Diotima&#x27;s account of the ladder of love in its ascent to the non-physical realm of the forms. Alcibiades&#x27;s presence deflects attention back to physical beauty, sexual passions, and bodily limitations, hence highlighting human fragility.

&quot;Fragility&quot; brought attention to Nussbaum throughout the humanities. It garnered wide praise in academic reviews, and even drew acclaim in the popular media. Camille Paglia credited &quot;Fragility&quot; with matching &quot;the highest academic standards&quot; of the twentieth century, and &quot;The Times Higher Education&quot; called it &quot;a supremely scholarly work&quot;. Nussbaum&#x27;s reputation extended her influence beyond print and into television programs like PBS&#x27;s Bill Moyers.

===&quot;Cultivating Humanity&quot;===
&quot;Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education&quot; appeals to classical Greek texts as a basis for defense and reform of the liberal education. Noting the Greek cynic philosopher Diogenes&#x27; aspiration to transcend &quot;local origins and group memberships&quot; in favor of becoming &quot;a citizen of the world&quot;, Nussbaum traces the development of this idea through the Stoics, Cicero, and eventually the classical liberalism of Adam Smith and Immanuel Kant. Nussbaum champions multiculturalism in the context of ethical universalism, defends scholarly inquiry into race, gender, and human sexuality, and further develops the role of literature as narrative imagination into ethical questions.

At the same time, Nussbaum also censured certain scholarly trends. She excoriated deconstructionist Jacques Derrida saying &quot;on truth [he is] simply not worth studying for someone who has been studying Quine and Putnam and Davidson&quot;. She cites Zhang Longxi, who labels Derrida&#x27;s analysis of Chinese culture &quot;pernicious&quot; and without &quot;evidence of serious study&quot;. More broadly, Nussbaum criticized Michel Foucault for his &quot;historical incompleteness [and] lack of conceptual clarity&quot;, but nevertheless singled him out for providing &quot;the only truly important work to have entered philosophy under the banner of &#x27;postmodernism.&#x27; Nussbaum is even more critical of figures like Allan Bloom, Roger Kimball, and George Will for what she considers their &quot;shaky&quot; knowledge of non-Western cultures and inaccurate caricatures of today&#x27;s humanities departments.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; praised &quot;Cultivating Humanity&quot; as &quot;a passionate, closely argued defense of multiculturalism&quot; and hailed it as &quot;a formidable, perhaps definitive defense of diversity on American campuses&quot;. Nussbaum received the 2002 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Education for &quot;Cultivating Humanity&quot;.

===&quot;Sex and Social Justice&quot;===
&quot;Sex and Social Justice&quot; argues that sex and sexuality are morally irrelevant distinctions that have been artificially enforced as sources of social hierarchy; thus, feminism and social justice have common concerns. Rejecting anti-universalist objections, Nussbaum proposes functional freedoms, or central human capabilities, as a rubric of social justice.

Nussbaum discusses at length the feminist critiques of liberalism itself, including the charge advanced by Alison Jaggar that liberalism demands ethical egoism. Nussbaum notes that liberalism emphasizes respect for &quot;others&quot; as individuals, and further argues that Jaggar has elided the distinction between individualism and self-sufficiency. Nussbaum accepts Catharine MacKinnon&#x27;s critique of abstract liberalism, assimilating the salience of history and context of group hierarchy and subordination, but concludes that this appeal is rooted in liberalism rather than a critique of it.

Nussbaum condemns the practice of female genital mutilation, citing deprivation of normative human functioning in its risks to health, impact on sexual functioning, violations of dignity, and conditions of non-autonomy. Emphasizing that female genital mutilation is carried out by brute force, its irreversibility, its non-consensual nature, and its links to customs of male domination, Nussbaum urges feminists to confront female genital mutilation as an issue of injustice.

Nussbaum also refines the concept of &quot;objectification&quot;, as originally advanced by Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin. Nussbaum defines the idea of treating as an object with seven qualities: instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness, fungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity. Her characterization of pornography as a tool of objectification puts Nussbaum at odds with sex-positive feminism. At the same time, Nussbaum argues in support of the legalization of prostitution, a position she reiterated in a 2008 essay following the Spitzer scandal, writing: &quot;The idea that we ought to penalize women with few choices by removing one of the ones they do have is grotesque.&quot;

&quot;Sex and Social Justice&quot; was highly praised by critics in the press. &quot;Salon&quot; declared: &quot;She shows brilliantly how sex is used to deny some people—i.e., women and gay men—social justice.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the work as &quot;elegantly written and carefully argued&quot;. Kathryn Trevenen praised Nussbaum&#x27;s effort to shift feminist concerns toward interconnected transnational efforts, and for explicating a set of universal guidelines to structure an agenda of social justice. Patrick Hopkins singled out for praise Nussbaum&#x27;s &quot;masterful&quot; chapter on sexual objectification. Radical feminist Andrea Dworkin faulted Nussbaum for &quot;consistent over-intellectualization of emotion, which has the inevitable consequence of mistaking suffering for cruelty&quot;.

===&quot;Hiding from Humanity&quot;===
&quot;Hiding from Humanity&quot; extends Nussbaum&#x27;s work in moral psychology to probe the arguments for including two emotions—shame and disgust—as legitimate bases for legal judgments. Nussbaum argues that individuals tend to repudiate their bodily imperfection or animality through the projection of fears about contamination. This cognitive response is in itself irrational, because we cannot transcend the animality of our bodies. Noting how projective disgust has wrongly justified group subordination (mainly of women, Jews, and homosexuals), Nussbaum ultimately discards disgust as a reliable basis of judgment.

In an interview with &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, Nussbaum elaborated:
Nussbaum&#x27;s work was received with wide praise. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called her argument &quot;characteristically lucid&quot; and hailed her as &quot;America&#x27;s most prominent philosopher of public life&quot;. Her reviews in national newspapers and magazines garnered unanimous praise. In academic circles, Stefanie A. Lindquist of Vanderbilt University lauded Nussbaum&#x27;s analysis as a &quot;remarkably wide ranging and nuanced treatise on the interplay between emotions and law&quot;.

A prominent exception was Roger Kimball&#x27;s review published in &quot;The New Criterion&quot;, in which he accused Nussbaum of &quot;fabricating&quot; the renewed prevalence of shame and disgust in public discussions and says she intends to &quot;undermine the inherited moral wisdom of millennia&quot;. He rebukes her for &quot;contempt for the opinions of ordinary people&quot; and ultimately accuses Nussbaum herself of &quot;hiding from humanity&quot;.

Nussbaum has recently drawn on and extended her work on disgust to produce a new analysis of the legal issues regarding sexual orientation and same-sex conduct. Her book &quot;From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and the Constitution&quot; was published by Oxford University Press in 2009, as part of their &quot;Inalienable Rights&quot; series, edited by Geoffrey Stone.

===&quot;From Disgust to Humanity&quot;===
In her 2010 book &quot;From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law&quot;, Nussbaum analyzes the role that disgust plays in law and public debate in the United States. The book primarily analyzes constitutional legal issues facing gay and lesbian Americans but also analyzes issues such as anti-miscegenation statutes, segregation, antisemitism and the caste system in India as part of its broader thesis regarding the &quot;politics of disgust&quot;.

Nussbaum posits that the fundamental motivation of those advocating legal restrictions against gay and lesbian Americans is a &quot;politics of disgust&quot;. These legal restrictions include blocking sexual orientation being protected under anti-discrimination laws (see &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;), sodomy laws against consenting adults (see &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;), constitutional bans against same-sex marriage (see California Proposition 8 (2008)). Nussbaum also argues that legal bans on conducts, such as nude dancing in private clubs, nudity on private beaches, the possession and consumption of alcohol in seclusion, gambling in seclusion or in a private club, which remain on the books, partake of the politics of disgust and should be overturned.

She identifies the &quot;politics of disgust&quot; closely with Lord Devlin and his famous opposition to the Wolfenden report, which recommended decriminalizing private consensual homosexual acts, on the basis that those things would &quot;disgust the average man&quot;. To Devlin, the mere fact some people or act may produce popular emotional reactions of disgust provides an appropriate guide for legislating. She also identifies the &#x27;wisdom of repugnance&#x27; as advocated by Leon Kass as another &quot;politics of disgust&quot; school of thought as it claims that disgust &quot;in crucial cases ... repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason&#x27;s power fully to articulate it&quot;.

Nussbaum goes on to explicitly oppose the concept of a disgust-based morality as an appropriate guide for legislating. Nussbaum notes that popular disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for persecution. Drawing upon her earlier work on the relationship between disgust and shame, Nussbaum notes that at various times, racism, antisemitism, and sexism, have all been driven by popular revulsion.

In place of this &quot;politics of disgust&quot;, Nussbaum argues for the harm principle from John Stuart Mill as the proper basis for limiting individual liberties. Nussbaum argues the harm principle, which supports the legal ideas of consent, the age of majority, and privacy, protects citizens while the &quot;politics of disgust&quot; is merely an unreliable emotional reaction with no inherent wisdom. Furthermore, Nussbaum argues this &quot;politics of disgust&quot; has denied and continues to deny citizens humanity and equality before the law on no rational grounds and causes palpable social harms to the groups affected.

&quot;From Disgust to Humanity&quot; earned acclaim from liberal American publications, and prompted interviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other magazines. It was criticized by a conservative magazine, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;.

=== &quot;Creating Capabilities&quot; ===

The book &quot;Creating Capabilities&quot;, first published in 2011, outlines a unique theory regarding the Capability approach or the Human development approach. Nussbaum draws on theories of other notable advocates of the Capability approach like Amartya Sen, but has a distinct approach. She proposes to choose a list of capabilities based on some aspects of John Rawls&#x27; concept of &quot;central human capabilities.&quot; 

Nussbaum&#x27;s book combines ideas from the Capability approach, development economics, and distributive justice to substantiate a qualitative theory on capabilities. She criticizes existing economic indicators like GDP as failing to fully account for quality of life and assurance of basic needs, instead rewarding countries with large growth distributed highly unequally across the population. The book also aims to serve as an introduction to the Capability approach more generally; it is accessible to students and newcomers to the material because of the current lack of general knowledge about this approach. Finally, Nussbaum compares her approach with other popular approaches to human development and economic welfare, including Utilitarianism, Rawlsian Justice, and Welfarism in order to argue why the Capability approach should be prioritized by development economics policymakers.

<doc id="341299" wikidata="Q58036" url="?curid=341299" title="Ilse Koch">
<text>Ilse Koch (22 September 1906 – 1 September 1967) was a German war criminal who committed atrocities while her husband Karl-Otto Koch was commandant at Buchenwald. Though Ilse Koch had no official position in the Nazi state, she became one of the most infamous Nazi figures at the war&#x27;s end and was referred to as the &quot;Kommandeuse of Buchenwald&quot;.

Because of the egregiousness of her alleged actions, including that she had selected tattooed prisoners for death in order to fashion lampshades and other items from their skins, her 1947 U.S. military commission court trial at Dachau received worldwide media attention, as did the testimony of survivors who ascribed sadistic and perverse acts of violence to Koch – giving rise to the image of her as &quot;the concentration camp murderess&quot;.

However, the most serious of these allegations were found to be without proof in two different legal processes, one conducted by an American military commission court at Dachau in 1947, and another by the West German Judiciary at Augsburg in 1950–1951. Harold Kuhn and Richard Schneider, two U.S. Army lawyers tasked with conducting the official review of her conviction at Dachau, noted that &quot;in spite of the extravagant statements made in the newspapers, the record contains little convincing evidence against the accused... In regard to the widely publicised charges that she ordered inmates killed for their tattooed skin, the record is especially silent&quot;.

That the wild claims were dismissed as lacking evidence did little to sway public opinion. She was known as &quot;The Witch of Buchenwald&quot; () by the inmates because of her suspected cruelty and toward prisoners. She has been nicknamed &quot;The Beast of Buchenwald&quot;, the &quot;Queen of Buchenwald&quot;, the &quot;Red Witch of Buchenwald&quot;, &quot;Butcher Widow&quot;, and &quot;The Bitch of Buchenwald&quot;. 

She died by suicide at Aichach women&#x27;s prison on 1 September 1967 at age 60.

==Early life==
Koch was born Margarete Ilse Köhler in Dresden, Germany, in 1906. She was the daughter of a former military commander. She was known as a polite and happy child in her elementary school. At the age of 15, she entered an accountancy school. Later, she entered employment as a bookkeeping clerk. At the time the economy of Germany had not yet recovered from defeat in World War I. In 1932, she became a member of the Nazi Party. Through her social engagement with members of the local SS detachment in Dresden, she met her future husband, Karl-Otto Koch, in 1934.


In 1936, she followed Koch to Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin, where he had been posted as Commandant. They requested permission to marry from the SS Office of Racial and Settlement Affairs, which investigated their &quot;fitness for marriage&quot;. This was determined according to racial criteria and Ilse provided evidence of her Aryan ancestry. The couple married the following year at Sachsenhausen concentration camp.

In July 1937, Karl gave up his post at Sachsenhausen in order to establish and take command of Buchenwald. Karl and Ilse had two daughters and one son, who were all born on the Buchenwald concentration camp grounds from October 1937. The family lived in the camp commandant&#x27;s three-story villa at Buchenwald and were regularly visited by SS officers Theodor Eicke and Richard Glücks, and on one occasion by the SS leader Heinrich Himmler.

==War crimes==
Following the war, she was accused of having selected tattooed prisoners to be killed, in order to have decorative objects such as lampshades and book bindings made from their skins. For example, two inmates, Josef Ackermann and Gustav Wegerer, testified in 1950 that they had witnessed (circa August 1941) a lampshade being prepared from human skin to be presented to Ilse Koch. This crime, however, has been said to be apocryphal. While various objects fashioned from human skins were discovered in Buchenwald&#x27;s pathology department at liberation, their connection to Koch was tenuous, given that she had not been at the camp since the summer of 1943. The more likely culprit was SS doctor Erich Wagner, who wrote a dissertation while serving at Buchenwald on the purported link he saw between habitual criminality and the practice of tattooing one&#x27;s skin.

However, authoritative testimony from numerous witnesses at Koch&#x27;s postwar trials firmly established that she had made extensive use of slave labor at the camp, had assaulted inmates on several occasions, and had reported inmates to the camp SS for beatings — beatings that resulted in death on at least one occasion. In 1940, Koch also commissioned the construction of an indoor riding arena, which cost over 250,000 reichsmarks ($100,000 US as per 1940 exchange rates). Prisoners were reported to have died laboring to complete its construction. 

==SS investigation and trial==
In 1941, Josias von Waldeck-Pyrmont, SS and Police Leader for Weimar, began an internal investigation into Karl-Otto Koch&#x27;s governance of Buchenwald, as rumors of corruption and embezzlement reached his office. After discovering significant evidence of graft, Waldeck had Karl arrested on 18 December 1941. When Karl&#x27;s friend, SS chief Heinrich Himmler heard of Karl&#x27;s arrest, however, he ordered him released. Karl was nonetheless relieved of his duties at Buchenwald, and sent instead to command Majdanek concentration and extermination camp. Ilse Koch continued to live in the SS settlement at Buchenwald in Karl&#x27;s absence. However, on 24 August 1943, both Karl and Ilse were arrested following a renewed investigation led by SS judge Konrad Morgen. Morgen&#x27;s indictment, issued 17 August 1944, formally charged Karl Koch with the &quot;embezzlement and concealing of funds and goods in an amount of at least 200,000 RM,&quot; and the &quot;premeditated murder&quot; of three inmates - ostensibly to prevent them from giving evidence to the SS investigatory commission. Ilse was charged with the &quot;habitual receiving of stolen goods, and taking for her benefit at least 25,000 RM...&quot; While Ilse Koch was acquitted at the subsequent SS trial in December 1944, Karl was found guilty, sentenced to death, and ultimately executed at Buchenwald only days prior to its liberation. Following the trial, Ilse Koch was released after sixteen months in the Gestapo prison in Weimar, and moved with her two children into a small flat in Ludwigsburg. She was arrested by American occupation authorities in Ludwigsburg on 30 June 1945, after being recognized on the street by a former inmate of Buchenwald.

==Trial before the US Military Commission Court at Dachau==

Following her arrest by American occupation authorities, Koch was chosen to stand trial alongside 30 other defendants accused of having committed war crimes at Buchenwald. The defendants would be tried by an American military court at Dachau in 1947 and be prosecuted by Lt. Col. William Denson for the single charge of &quot;participating in a common design to commit war crimes.&quot; According to this expansive charge, the prosecution was not required to show that Koch or any of her codefendants had committed any specific act of violence or atrocity, but only that they had in some fashion aided and abetted the functioning of the murderous criminal enterprise that was Buchenwald. Denson described her during the trial as “no woman in the usual sense but a creature from some other tortured world.”

Like each of her codefendants at the Buchenwald trial, Ilse Koch was ultimately found guilty by the court on 14 August 1947; she was sentenced to life imprisonment. She was seven months pregnant with her fourth child at the time of her sentence, by an unknown father.

==Sentence reduction and controversy==
Following Koch&#x27;s conviction at Dachau, her sentence was subjected to various levels of mandatory judicial review, before going to Gen. Lucius D. Clay, the interim military governor of the American Zone in Germany, for final approval. First to review Koch&#x27;s case were two lawyers in the office of the Deputy Judge Advocate for War Crimes, Harold Kuhn and Richard Schneider. They concluded that &quot;in spite of the extravagant statements made in the newspapers, the record contains little convincing evidence against the accused... In regard to the widely publicized charges that she ordered inmates killed for their tattooed skin, the record is especially silent.&quot; They found key testimony given against Koch to be &quot;based on presumption and of doubtful veracity.&quot; Though Koch was shown to have beaten a few inmates, &quot;no deaths or serious injuries are shown to have resulted.&quot; The War Crimes Review Board, a separate advisory body made up of military and civilian lawyers, conducted its own review, and similarly concluded that there was no reliable evidence that she had prisoners killed, &quot;nor is there any evidence in this record of any kind that she at any time ever ordered any article made of human skin.&quot;

Upon receiving the reports of the War Crimes Review Board and his legal staff, and after reviewing the trial record himself, Judge Advocate Col. J.L. Harbaugh noted, &quot;I can&#x27;t see anything on which we honestly can hold the accused. There is no question but that she was tried in the newspapers, and suffered both before and during her trial from her unique position as the only woman at the camp.&quot; Harbaugh labelled her sentence &quot;excessive&quot; and recommended that General Clay reduce her sentence to four years. Heeding the recommendations of the U.S. Army&#x27;s judicial branch, Clay reduced the sentence on 8 June 1948, on the grounds that &quot;there was no convincing evidence that she had selected inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin&quot;.

However, Clay also suggested that Koch could be tried under West German law: &quot;I hold no sympathy for Ilse Koch. She was a woman of depraved character and ill repute. She had done many things reprehensible and punishable, undoubtedly, under German law. We were not trying her for those things. We were trying her as a war criminal on specific charges.&quot;

The reduction of Koch&#x27;s sentence to four years resulted in an uproar, when it was made public on 16 September 1948, but Clay stood firm by his decision. Years later, Clay stated:

News of Koch&#x27;s sentence reduction created major controversy in the United States. Editorial pages in major newspapers asked whether the US Army had lost its capacity for sound judgment, while continuing to assert that Koch was a sexual deviant who had killed prisoners for their skins. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; demanded to know &quot;in the name of basic human justice and decency, what &#x27;further&#x27; does the army need to slap Ilse into jail and keep her there?&quot; The &quot;New York Post&quot; labeled the reduction of Koch&#x27;s sentence &quot;Clay&#x27;s counter-atrocity,&quot; and described it as &quot;almost beyond credence.&quot; Ed Sullivan, writing for the &quot;New York News&quot;, pondered whether &quot;the Army reduced [Koch&#x27;s] sentence... so she could get back into the lampshade business.&quot;

Such protests in the press found their parallel on the streets of American cities. Rallies were organized by both veterans associations and the American Jewish Congress, while General Clay, who visited the United States in the midst of the controversy, was picketed by protesters, some of whom carried lampshades and demanded his removal from European command.

With pressure mounting from both the public and the press, a group of U.S. Senators resolved to investigate the circumstances of Koch&#x27;s sentence reduction. The Senate investigation, led by Homer S. Ferguson, culminated in hearings at which major participants at Koch&#x27;s Dachau trial were called to testify. Dachau trial chief prosecutor William Denson was particularly insistent that Koch&#x27;s sentence reduction was unjust and that the witness testimony he drew upon was sufficient to secure her conviction and life sentence. Ultimately, the Senate investigation resulted in a recommendation that Koch be tried again – not by the U.S. Army, but by the newly independent West German judiciary. According to the committee&#x27;s final report, in &quot;being a woman,&quot; and in acting independently, Koch&#x27;s perpetration of violence had been &quot;more unnatural and more deliberate.&quot; It was, the report concluded, &quot;highly important that Ilse Koch receive the just punishment she so justly deserves without further doing violence to long-established safe-guards of democratic justice...&quot;

==Trial at Augsburg==
At the urging of the U.S. government, the West German judiciary put Koch on trial for crimes against German nationals, something over which the American military court at Dachau had not had jurisdiction. The U.S. government further instructed the military to give full assistance to West German investigators.

Koch was immediately re-arrested following her release from Landsberg prison in 1949. Bavarian chief prosecutor Johann Ilkow indicted Koch for twenty-five misdemeanor counts of grievous bodily harm, incitement to grievous bodily harm in a number of cases &quot;no longer determinable,&quot; sixty-five counts of incitement to attempted murder, and twenty-five counts of incitement to murder. The hearing opened on 27 November 1950 before the District Court at Augsburg and lasted seven weeks, during which 250 witnesses were heard, including 50 for the defense. Koch herself said during the trial that “I never saw anything at Buchenwald which might have been against humanity… I was too busy raising my two children.” Her mental health began to suffer considerably during the trial, leading to her collapse in court in late December 1950, and again in January 1951. At least four witnesses for the prosecution testified that they had seen Koch choose tattooed prisoners, who were then killed, or had seen or been involved in the process of making human-skin lampshades from tattooed skin. However, this charge was dropped by the prosecution when they could not prove lampshades or any other items were actually made from human skin.

On 15 January 1951, the court pronounced its verdict, in a 111-page-long decision, for which Koch was not present in court. It was concluded that the previous trials in 1944 and 1947 were not a bar to proceedings under the principle of &quot;ne bis in idem&quot;, as at the 1944 trial Koch had only been charged with receiving stolen goods, while in 1947 she had been accused of crimes against foreigners after 1 September 1939, and not with crimes against German nationals. She was ultimately convicted of seven misdemeanor counts of incitement to grievous bodily harm, one count of incitement to attempted murder, and one count of incitement to murder. On 15 January 1951, she was sentenced to life imprisonment and the permanent forfeiture of her civil rights. In its written judgment, the Augsburg court labeled Koch&#x27;s crimes at Buchenwald particularly egregious because she &quot;consciously suppressed any feeling of compassion and pity she had as a woman...,&quot; but instead gave &quot;free rein to her pursuit of power and prestige, her arrogance and her selfishness.&quot; The court note in particular Koch&#x27;s &quot;stubborn and irresponsible denial&quot; and incapacity for even the &quot;slightest admission of guilt.&quot; 
Koch appealed to have the judgment quashed, but the appeal was dismissed on 22 April 1952 by the Federal Court of Justice. She later made several petitions for a pardon, all of which were rejected by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice. Koch protested her life sentence, to no avail, to the International Human Rights Commission.

==Family==
Ilse and Karl Koch had a son named Artwin (b. 1938), and two daughters, Gisela (b. 1939) and Gudrun (b. 1940). Gudrun died of pneumonia at four months of age in February 1941; Artwin committed suicide in 1964; Gisela died in 2021. In addition, Ilse Koch conceived another child with a fellow German war crimes internee under murky circumstances while awaiting her trial at Dachau. Koch gave birth to a son she named Uwe Köhler while incarcerated at Landsberg prison in October 1947. The child was immediately handed over to Bavarian child welfare authorities. Uwe only discovered the identity of his mother as a teenager, and began to correspond with, and visit, his mother in 1966.

==Suicide==
Koch hanged herself with a bed sheet at Aichach women&#x27;s prison on 1 September 1967 at age 60. She experienced delusions and had become convinced that concentration camp survivors would abuse her in her cell. Her suicide note was written to her son Uwe: &quot;There is no other way. Death for me is a release.&quot;

In 1971, Uwe sought posthumous rehabilitation for his mother. Via the press, he used clemency documents from her former lawyer in 1957 and his impression of her based on their relationship in an attempt to change people&#x27;s attitude towards Koch.

==In popular culture==
* Woody Guthrie wrote &quot;Ilsa Koch&quot;, a song about her abuses in Buchenwald, her imprisonment and release; it was recorded by The Klezmatics.

<text>Abu Muslim Abd al-Rahman ibn Muslim al-Khurasani (; ; born 718/19 or 723/27, died 755) was a Persian general who led the Abbasid Revolution that toppled the Umayyad dynasty, leading to the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate.

Little is known about Abu Muslim&#x27;s origins, but by the early 740s he had been in contact with Abbasid agents and around the year 745 he was sent to Khorasan. In 747, Abu Muslim ignited an open revolt against Umayyad rule and quickly took the city of Merv. He gradually strengthened Abbasid control over Khorasan, and was appointed governor of the province following the establishment of the Abbasid caliphate in 750. Wary of Abu Muslim&#x27;s rising influence and popularity, the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur, ordered his death. He was executed in front of the caliph in Al-Mada&#x27;in in 755 on charges of heresy.

==Origin and name==
According to Gholam-Hosayn Yusofi, &quot;sources differ regarding his original name and his origin. Some make him a descendant of Gōdarz and of the vizier Bozorgmehr and call him Ebrāhīm; some name him Behzādān, son of Vendād Hormoz; and others relate him to the Abbasids or to the Alids. These suggestions are all doubtful&quot;. He was most likely of Persian origin, and was born in either Merv or near Isfahan. The exact date is unknown, either in 718/9 or sometime in 723/7.

==Shia activist and missionary activity in Khurasan==
He grew up in Kufa, where he served as a slave and saddler of the Banu Ijl clan. It was there that Abu Muslim came into contact with Shia Muslims.

Kufa at the time was a hotbed of social and political unrest against the ruling Umayyad dynasty, whose policies favoured Arabs over non-Arab converts to Islam (&quot;mawālī&quot;) and were thus perceived to violate the Islamic promises of equality. The luxurious lifestyles of the Umayyad caliphs and their persecution of the Alids further alienated the pious. This rallied support for the Shi&#x27;a cause of rule by a member of the family of Muhammad, who would, as a God-guided &quot;imām&quot; or &quot;mahdī&quot;, rule according to the &quot;Quran&quot; and the &quot;Sunnah&quot; and create a truly Islamic government that would bring justice and peace to the Muslim community.

By 737 he is recorded among the followers of the &quot;ghālī&quot; (&quot;extremist, heterodox&quot;) al-Mughira. These activities landed him in prison, from where he was liberated in 741/2 by the leading Abbasid missionaries (&quot;naqāb&quot;, sing. &quot;naqīb&quot;) on their way to Mecca. He was introduced to the head of the Abbasid clan, Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdallah, who in 745/6 sent him to direct the missionary effort in Khurasan.

Khurasan, and the Iranian eastern half of the Caliphate in general, offered fertile ground for the Abbasids&#x27; missionary activities. Far from the Umayyad metropolitan province of Syria, Khurasan had a distinct identity. It was home to a large Arab settler community, which in turn had resulted in a large number of native converts, as well as intermarriage between Arabs and Iranians. As a frontier province exposed to constant warfare, the local Muslims were militarily experienced, and the common struggle had helped further unify the Arab and native Muslims of Khurasan, with a common dislike towards the centralizing tendencies of Damascus and the exactions of the Syrian governors. According to later accounts, already in 718/9 the Abbasids had dispatched twelve &quot;naqāb&quot; into the province, but modern scholars are sceptical of such claims, and it appears that only after the failure of the Revolt of Zayd ibn Ali in 740 did the Abbasid missionary movement begin to make headway in Khurasan. In 745, the Khurasani Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta&#x27;i travelled west to swear allegiance to Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, and it was with him that Abu Muslim was sent east to assume control.

When Abu Muslim arrived in Khurasan, the province was in turmoil due to the impact of the ongoing Umayyad civil war of the Third Fitna, which had re-ignited the feud between the Yaman and Qays tribal groups: the numerous Yamani element in the province opposed the longtime governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, and sought to replace him with their champion, Juday al-Kirmani. Al-Kirmani led an uprising against Ibn Sayyar, and drove him from the provincial capital, Merv, in late 746, with the governor fleeing to the Qaysi stronghold of Nishapur.

==Abu Muslim and the Abbasid Revolution==

He took Merv in December 747 (or January 748), defeating the Umayyad governor Nasr ibn Sayyar, as well as Shayban al-Khariji, a Kharijite aspirant to the caliphate. He became the de facto governor of Khurasan, and gained fame as a general in the late 740s in defeating the rebellion of Bihafarid, the leader of a syncretic Persian sect that was Mazdaist. Abu Muslim received support in suppressing the rebellion both from purist Muslims and Zoroastrians.
==Rule of Khurasan and death==

After the establishment of the Abbasid regime, Abu Muslim remained in Khurasan as its governor. In this role he suppressed the Shi&#x27;a uprising of Sharik ibn Shaikh al-Mahri in Bukhara in 750/1, and furthered the Muslim conquest of Central Asia, sending Abu Da&#x27;ud Khalid ibn Ibrahim to campaign in the east.

His heroic role in the revolution and military skill, along with his conciliatory politics toward Shia, Sunnis, Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, made him extremely popular among the people. Although it appears that Abu al-&#x27;Abbas al-Saffah trusted him in general, he was wary of his power, limiting his entourage to 500 men upon his arrival to Iraq on his way to Hajj in 754. Abu al-&#x27;Abbas&#x27;s brother, al-Mansur (r. 754–775), advised al-Saffah on more than one occasion to have Abu Muslim killed, fearing his rising influence and popularity. It seems that this dislike was mutual, with Abu Muslim aspiring to more power and looking down in disdain on al-Mansur, feeling al-Mansur owed Abu Muslim for his position. When the new caliph&#x27;s uncle, Abdullah ibn Ali rebelled, Abu Muslim was requested by al-Mansur to crush this rebellion, which he did, and Abdullah was given to his nephew as a prisoner. Abdullah was ultimately executed.

Relations deteriorated quickly when al-Mansur sent his chamberlain Abu-al Khasib to inventory the spoils of war, and then appointed Abu Muslim governor of Syria and Egypt, outside his powerbase. After an increasingly acrimonious correspondence between Abu Muslim and al-Mansur, Abu Muslim feared he was going to be killed if he appeared in the presence of the Caliph. He later changed his mind and decided to appear in his presence due to a combination of perceived disobedience, al-Mansur&#x27;s promise to keep him as governor of Khurasan, and the assurances of some of his close aides, some of whom were bribed by al-Mansur. He went to Iraq to meet al-Mansur in al-Mada&#x27;in in 755. Al-Mansur proceeded to enumerate his grievances against Abu Muslim, who kept reminding the Caliph of his efforts to enthrone him. Against Abu Muslim were also charges of being a zindiq or heretic. al-Mansur then signaled five of his guards behind a portico to kill him. Abu Muslim&#x27;s mutilated body was thrown in the river Tigris, and his commanders were bribed to acquiesce to the murder.

== Crypto-Zoroastrianism ==
Abu Muslim&#x27;s eventual downfall and execution on charges of heresy have contributed to doubts cast on the sincerity of his Islamic faith. In particular this includes his close relationship with the mobad Sunpadh and his repeated praise of Zoroastrianism.

Following his successful campaign in Gorgan, there is a report of a tribesman being able to bypass Abu Muslim&#x27;s line and relay news of the Umayyad&#x27;s destruction by shaving his beard, donning a kushti, and pretending to be a Zoroastrian (&quot;tassabbaha bi&#x27;l-majus&quot;), which suggests his ranks were of Zoroastrian origin. Furthermore, there are records indicating that Abu Muslim planned to execute all Arabic speakers in Khorasan.

In the &quot;Siyasatnameh&quot;, al-Mulk emphasized that Abu Muslim had a talent for appealing to Zoroastrian revivalism.Whenever he was alone with Zoroastrians, he would say, &quot;According to one of the books of the Sasanians which I have found, the Arab empire is finished. I shall not turn back until I have destroyed the Kaaba, for this has been [wrongly] substituted for the sun; we shall make the sun our qibla as it was in olden time&quot;Despite his assistance in crushing Behafarid&#x27;s heresy and the possibility of his own Zoroastrian sympathies, Abu Muslim has not been remembered favourably by the Zoroastrian Orthodoxy in the Middle Persian tradition, as both the Zand-i Wahman yasn and Zaratosht-nama censure Abu Muslim.

== Legacy ==
His murder was not well received by the residents of Khurasan, and there was resentment and rebellion among the population over the brutal methods used by Al-Mansur. He became a legendary figure for many in Persia, and several Persian heretics started revolts claiming he had not died and would return; the latter included his own propagandist Ishaq al-Turk, the Zoroastrian cleric Sunpadh in Nishapur, the Abu Muslimiyya subsect of the Kaysanites Shia, and al-Muqanna in Khurasan. Even Babak claimed descent from him.

There are different variations of legends about Abu Muslim and forms of his worship in Central Asia, Iran and Afghanistan. Depending on particular local traditions, some local saints are legitimized through an imaginary connection with Abu Muslim.

== Books ==
At least three epic romances were written about him:

<doc id="341312" wikidata="Q8044112" url="?curid=341312" title="Xiamen Special Economic Zone">
<text>[[Xiamen]] Special Economic Zone (), established in October 1980, is one of the five special economic zones in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Originally comprising a territory of 2.5 km2 in Xiamen City, it was expanded to 131 km2 in 1984, covering the entire Xiamen Island, which comprises Huli District and Siming District excluding Gulangyu.

Haicang and Xinglin districts were designated &quot;Taiwan Businessmen Investment Zones&quot; on 20 May 1989, and Jimei District was designated in 1992. Foreign investment enjoys the same economic policies as in the special economic zone.

== Geography ==
Xiamen is in southeastern Fujian, China, beside the Taiwan Strait. The Kinmen Islands administered by Taiwan lie roughly 10 km away. Xiamen is next to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Xiamen has a good harbor, with a depth of 12 meters or more. The harbor is wide and rarely foggy or frozen and less silted, so cargo ships can enter and leave at essentially any time. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, Xiamen has been one of the important ports for foreign transportation and trade in China. The Xiamen Special Economic Zone, which originally covered a boundary of 2.5 km2 in Xiamen City, was expanded to 131 km2 in 1984, encompassing the whole Xiamen Island, including Huli District and Siming District.

== Demographics ==
Becoming a special economic zone has greatly influenced Xiamen&#x27;s demographics and economy. Xiamen Special Economic Zone has a resident population of about 5.1 million, according to the 2020 census. However, it has a large floating population of temporary residents estimated to be around 2.7 million. The share of the mobile population employed in the five major industries such as manufacturing, wholesale and retail, accommodation and catering, construction and social services is about 90%. The city has experienced rapid population growth since it was designated as a SEZ in 1980.

== Economic History of Xiamen (Pre-1945) ==
During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, Xiamen was a hub of contraband trade and pirate activity. It was fortified, in 1387 to try and ward off pirates which is also when the name &quot;Xiamen&quot; was first used. During the Qing dynasty, after the opium wars, trade with Europeans opened as Xiamen was designated as a treaty port and it continued its dynastic characteristic of being a maritime trade hub. British trade expanded from 380,000 silver dollars in 1843 to over 2 million in 1852.

It was also a migration hub of the time as more than 100,000 Chinese annually returned or left China through this treaty port from 1866 through the republic era World War two, the Sino Japanese war, and the Chinese civil war put an end to Xiamen&#x27;s economic prosperity during the pre revolution time period.

== Economics of Xiamen (Post-1980) ==
In October 1980, the State Council of the People’s Republic China approved the establishment of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone, designating 2.5 square kilometers of land in the Huli area in the northwest of Xiamen Island. Xiamen was one of five Special Economic Zones designated in 1980.

Continuing from its dynastic period, Xiamen became an important maritime cargo and container port to allow shipping from major world ports into China. The Xiamen Special Economic Zone has expanded to cover the entire Xiamen Island, including Gulangyu Island, with a total area of 131 square kilometers in 1985. In 1988, the State Council approved the establishment of Xiamen as a planned city, giving it economic management authority equivalent to that of a province. In 1989 and 1992, the State Council approved the establishment of three Taiwan investment zones, namely Haicang, Xinglin and Jimei, with investments in the zones being handled in accordance with the current special economic zone policies.

Fujian is responsible for 32.1% of all Taiwanese funds in the mainland. Xiamen&#x27;s gross national product increased by 4.9 times over the 10 years since it opened in 1980 to 5.016 billion RMB. Other statistical increases include a 6.3 times increase in industrial and agricultural output value and per capita income increased from 631 RMB to 3720 RMB over the same 10 year span.

In November 1992, the State Council approved the establishment of Xiangyu Free Trade Zone in Xiamen. In February 1994, the Central Government determined Xiamen as a sub-provincial city.

In March 1994, the Second Session of the Eighth National People&#x27;s Congress granted Xiamen the power to make laws and regulations within the scope of the Special Economic Zone. In June 2010, the State Council approved the expansion of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to the whole city of Xiamen, and the inclusion of four districts outside the island, namely Jimei, Haicang, Tongan and Xiangan, into the SEZ, making the Xiamen SEZ 12 times larger.

Xiamen has entered a new stage of integrated development within and outside the island. On March 8, 2011, the State Council officially approved the &quot;Economic Zone Development Plan for the West Coast of the Taiwan Strait&quot;. This Plan clearly states that Xiamen should be supported to establish a regional financial service center across the Taiwan Strait, expand pilot financial reforms, and take the lead in experimenting with Taiwan&#x27;s offshore finance and fund clearing.

Xiamen continues to enjoy benefits from being an early SEZ with it being known as a center for international trade. Xiamen’s GDP growth rate as of 2019 was 7.9% which outpaces almost all other Chinese cities. Xiamen’s GDP also passed Taiwans in 2020.

== Economic Statistics ==
A decade following its establishment as a Special Economic Zone, Xiamen has witnessed remarkable economic growth. According to the Fujian Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the total gross domestic product (GDP) of Xiamen has increased by approximately sixteenfold, while GDP per capita has quadrupled in comparison to the late 1990s. Furthermore, the registered population in Xiamen has doubled over the same period.

Regarding the inflows of actual foreign capital utilization reported by the Xiamen Bureau of Statistics, Siming district had relatively lower figures in the early 20th century than the other two districts. However, the district experienced the most significant increase and became the most actually-utilized foreign capital after 2010.
== Economic policies of the Xiamen SEZ ==
Special Economic Zones of China are intended to serve as special zones for accelerated economic development by employment of a subset of preferential policies, tax incentives, and infrastructure foundations. This shift in ideology promoted the transition to more of a market system promoting foreign direct investment and transition to rapid modernization. The preferential policies are set to execute the country wide 5 year development plan. With the release of the cities most recent 5 year plan, the 14th one, the city has committed to invest more in national innovation platforms and research centers. The SEZ will add half a percent more of the cities GDP to R&amp;D spending. Xiamen will also continue to invest in the core of their industries, including &quot;trade and logistics, financial services, software, information and technology services, and creative cultural tourism&quot;. With each Special economic zones and its own set of preferential policies, Xiamen’s most recent incentive plan April 13, 2018 encapsulates:

Opening Wider to Foreign Investments

* Incentive encouragement to actual paid-in foreign capital amounting to two percent of total for up to 20 million RMB per enterprise.
* Foreign direct investment over 10 million RMB will receive a reward for contributing VAT of 100 percent for the first two years and 50 percent for the three years following.
* Value-add foreign M&amp;A will also receive a reward of two percent over 10 million and capping at 20 million RMB.

Attract and retain Foreign Talents

* For foreign-funded enterprises with investments over 10 million RMB, their employees will receive a tax refund of 50 to 100 percent, depending on their paid income tax bracket.

<text>Chen Long (; ; born 18 January 1989), is a Chinese former professional badminton player. He is the 2016 Olympic champion, two-time World champion, and an Asian champion.

Affectionately known as &quot;The Great Wall of China&quot; by his fans, he is noted for his endurance, ability to dictate rallies and resolute defence. He is considered one of the greats of men&#x27;s singles badminton.

Chen was a former World number 1, occupying the top men&#x27;s singles ranking for 76 consecutive weeks from December 2014 to June 2016. He started his achievements in the international stage by winning the boys&#x27; singles title in the Asian and World Junior Championships in 2007, and then won his first professional tournament in the Philippines Open in 2009.

== Early life ==
Born in Shashi District, Jingzhou, Hubei Province, Chen had shown his talent as a badminton player when he was young, and entered the Sports School in Jingzhou at the age of seven in 1996. In 2000, he joined the Xiamen team, and was selected to join the national youth team in 2005. In 2006, Chen entered the national second team.

== Career ==

=== 2007–2008: Asian and World Junior Champions ===
Chen emerged as an Asian Junior Champion in 2007, and at the same year, he won the World Junior Championships. He also helped the Chinese team won the 2007 Suhandinata Cup.

In 2008, Chen was selected to join the national first team.

=== 2009–2010: Three tour titles, Thomas Cup and Asian Games Team Champions, World #4===
Chen won his first professional title at the Grand Prix Gold event in the 2009 Philippines Open, beating Hu Yun of Hong Kong in the final.
Chen participated in the Korea Open Super Series in January. He made it through to the semi-finals before losing to Danish player Peter Gade in three games, 13–21, 21–10, 17–21. A week later, in the Malaysia Open, he lost in the opening round to Boonsak Ponsana of Thailand.

In March, at the German Open, Chen lost in the final to his teammate, Bao Chunlai in two straight games. At the All England Open, he registered an impressive victory over 8th seed Jan Ø. Jørgensen in the first round but fell to Korea&#x27;s Son Wan-ho 18–21, 21–18, 19–21 in the second round. He followed up this disappointment with his best-ever performance in a Super Series event by making it through to the final of the Swiss Open, where he finished runner-up to compatriot Chen Jin.

Chen was part of the Chinese team that won gold at the 2010 Thomas Cup in Kuala Lumpur. He only featured in their opening match against Peru, taking just 31 minutes to beat his opponent, before being replaced in the team by Bao Chunlai for the later rounds. Chen&#x27;s first individual title of 2010 came at the Bitburger Open in Germany, where he beat Denmark&#x27;s Hans-Kristian Vittinghus 21–3, 12–21, 21–9 in the final of the Grand Prix Gold event. His good form continued when he finished runner-up to teammate Lin Dan at the China Masters two weeks later, going down 15–21, 21–13, 14–21 to the reigning Olympic champion.

Chen obtained a second team gold medal of the year with China at the Asian Games held in Guangzhou, but did not feature in the individual event. More success followed when he won the China Open Super Series two weeks later. His passage to the final included a controversial walkover by Lin Dan in the quarter-finals and a hard-fought victory over current World champion Chen Jin in the semi-finals. In the final, he squared off against teammate Bao Chunlai, emerging as the victor after 75 minutes of play. Chen&#x27;s attempt at back-to-back Super Series titles came to an end at the hands of former Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat in the semi-final of the Hong Kong Open the following week. Chen&#x27;s strong finish to the year saw his world ranking rise to a career-high of 4th, briefly becoming the top ranked Chinese player.

=== 2011: Three Superseries titles ===
In the first tournament of the new season, Chen Long was convincingly beaten by world number 1 Lee Chong Wei in the semi-final of the Malaysia Open. It took just 39 minutes for the Malaysian to blow away the upcoming Chinese star with a score of 21–9, 21–9. The effects of the demoralising defeat were still evident a week later when Chen lost in the second round of the Korea Open to Japanese player Kenichi Tago. His first individual title of the year came at the Thailand Open, where he beat experienced Korean player Lee Hyun-il in the final.

In August, Chen was eliminated in the first round of the World Championships by unheralded Guatemalan player Kevin Cordón in what was one of the shock results of the tournament. Cordón emerged the victor after clinching the third set 27–25 in a thrilling encounter. Chen sprang back from his shock exit from the World Championships by winning his first China Masters title after defeating his compatriot Chen Jin in the final. A week later, he won his first Japan Open by avenging his Malaysia Open loss to world number 1 Lee Chong Wei in the final. In October, Chen won his third consecutive Super Series tournament with another victory over Lee Chong Wei, this time in the final of the Denmark Open in its first year as a Premier Super Series event.

His highlights of the season were followed by an exit from the semi-finals of Hong Kong Open to his senior, Chen Jin and failure to defend his China Open title after losing to his compatriot, Lin Dan, in the final. He ended year 2011 with another runner-up in Super Series Master Finals, being beaten by Lin Dan again.

=== 2012: Second Thomas Cup, Olympic bronze and First Superseries Finals title===

In January, Chen reached the semi-finals of the Malaysia Open, where he lost to the home favorite, Lee Chong Wei in three games, 18-21, 21-17, 13-21. In March, he participated in the All England Open and was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Kenichi Tago. He then reached the semi-finals of the Swiss Open but was eliminated by Lee Hyun-il. In April, at the Badminton Asia Championships, Chen lost in the semi-finals to his teammate, Du Pengyu. In May, at the Thomas Cup, he won all the matches that he played in, thus helping China to clinch their ninth title. In June, Chen lost in the pre-quarterfinals of Indonesia Open, to Parupalli Kashyap, 21–17, 21–14.

In the 2012 Summer Olympics, Chen was defeated in the semi-final of the men&#x27;s singles competition by Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia, 21–13, 21–14, but went on to win bronze after defeating Lee Hyun-il in the bronze medal match. After the Olympics, Chen&#x27;s form picked up tremendously, starting from winning the China Masters in September, where he beat Hong Kong&#x27;s Hu Yun in the final. In October, he reached the semi-finals of the Denmark Open but was eliminated by his compatriot Du Pengyu once again. In November, he won both the China Open and the Hong Kong Open, beating Wang Zhengming and Lee Chong Wei respectively in the finals. At year-end, BWF Superseries Finals, Chen managed to avenge his previous defeats to Du Pengyu on tours, by beating him in the final to win his first Superseries Finals title.

=== 2013: First All England title and Sudirman Cup Champion ===
Chen carried his good form into the new season. In February, Chen won his first German Open title, defeating Tommy Sugiarto in the final. In March, Chen won convincingly against Lee Chong Wei in the 2013 All England Open in the finals, 21–17, 21–18. In April, at the Badminton Asia Championships, Chen once again lost to his teammate, Du Pengyu, albeit in the final this time. Despite missing the last two Sudirman Cup editions in 2009 and 2011, Chen Long emerged as the first singles player to help China lift its fifth consecutive trophy in 2013 edition. At the BWF World Championships held in August, Chen reached the quarter-finals but was defeated by Lin Dan. He won the Denmark Open against Lee Chong Wei, 24–22, 21-19, and then successfully defended his China Open title against compatriot Wang Zhengming in three games.

=== 2014: World Champion, Second Superseries Finals title and World #1 ===
Chen started the year with a victory against Lee Chong Wei in the Korean Open. Then, he was unable to defend his All England title as he lost to Lee Chong Wei in the finals. He subsequently lost in the Indian Open finals to the same opponent. In May, Chen played first singles for China at the 2014 Thomas Cup. They were unable to defend their title as they lost 0–3 to Japan in the semifinals. Chen took the blame for the surprise loss of the Chinese Team, casting doubt on his ability to depose Lin Dan as China&#x27;s MS &#x27;big brother&#x27;. Chen&#x27;s poor start to the season continued deep into the summer, when he saw early-round knockouts in the Japan Open to Hu Yun of Hong Kong and Indonesian Open to Denmark&#x27;s Jan Ø. Jørgensen.

However, his fortune reversed at the most important competition of the year. On 31 August, Chen defeated Lee Chong Wei in the finals with a score of 21–19, 21–19 to win his first-ever World Championship title at 2014 BWF World Championships held in Copenhagen, breaking his 7-month title drought. He would then continue this excellent form for the rest of the season, defeating Son Wan-ho in the final of the 2014 Denmark Super Series Premier, his 6th Super Series Premier title to date and first of the year. He would also make the finals of the 2014 Hong Kong Super Series. Chen ended the season on a high note after winning the 2014 BWF Super Series Masters Finals in Dubai, boasting a 3–0 record in the Group Stage and defeating Hans-Kristian Vittinghus 21–16, 21–10 in the final. With this victory, Chen ascended to World No.1, dethroning rival Lee Chong Wei and achieving the title of Year-End No.1 on the BWF World Ranking. This marked the first time in 6 years that a player other than Lee Chong Wei ended the year at the coveted No.1 ranking. Despite a slow start to the year, Chen&#x27;s 2014 was characterised by his first-ever World Championship, solid victories at the Denmark Open and Super Series Masters Finals, and for the first time achieving the rank of World No.1.

=== 2015: Seven tour titles, Second All England, World Championships and Sudirman Cup titles ===
Starting the year as World No.1, Chen&#x27;s first tournament of the season was the 2015 All England Super Series Premier, considered as the most reputable Super Series Premier title. Defeating compatriot Lin Dan in straight sets (21-13, 21-12) en route to the finals, Chen won his second All England title in 3 years with a 15–21, 21–17, 21–15 over Jan O Jorgensen. Chen continued his winning form in his next tournament, the 2015 Malaysia Super Series Premier, defeating Lin Dan, this time with a tighter scoreline of 20–22, 21–13, 21–11. Two consecutive victories over Lin Dan, long considered China&#x27;s strongest badminton player in the men&#x27;s singles discipline, was considered by many as Chen&#x27;s resolute ascension to the position of China MS No.1. A second-round exit to Hu Yun at the 2015 Singapore Super Series and a semi-final loss at the Badminton Asia Championships to compatriot Tian Houwei by way of walkover put a stop to Chen&#x27;s tournament-winning streak. In May, Chen was part of the Chinese team that won the Sudirman Cup. Victory over Viktor Axelsen at the 2015 Australian Super Series final with a score of 21–12, 14–21, 21-18 put Chen back in winning shape. This was followed by a quarter-finals exit at the 2015 Indonesia Super Series Premier, a tournament in which Chinese players routinely lose during the early stages. However, Chen would rediscover his form in the 2015 Chinese Taipei Open Grand Prix Gold with a victory over home favorite Chou Tien-chen.

He would then defend his World Championship title at the 2015 BWF World Championships held in Jakarta.

Chen would follow this up with another Super Series victory at the 2015 Korea Open Super Series, during which he defeated unseeded Ajay Jayaram 21–14, 21–13 in the final.

In October, Chen continued his fine form by defeating Tommy Sugiarto in the final to win the Denmark Super Series Premier. This was Chen&#x27;s 8th Super Series title, bringing his total SS (including Premier) tally to 16 and year-to-date titles to 7, the most he has achieved in one season. In November 2015, Chen reached the China Open final without losing a single set, however, a resurgent Lee Chong Wei proved tough to beat, losing the finals in two straight sets 21–15, 21–11, halting his 7 straight finals win in 2015.

In January, he reached the quarter-finals of the Malaysia Masters where he lost to Viktor Axelsen in three games. Similarly, in March, he reached the quarter-finals of the All England Open but lost to Lee Zii Jia in straight games.

=== 2021: Olympic silver ===
At the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Chen&#x27;s first tournament of the year, he managed to reach the final after defeating Raul Must and Pablo Abian in the group stage, Lee Zii Jia in the Round of 16, Chou Tien-chen in the quarter-finals and Anthony Ginting in the semi-finals. However, in the final, he was not able to overcome Viktor Axelsen, thus failing to defend his title from 2016. Fans expressed disappointment towards Chen Long for losing to Axelsen, despite defeating Ginting in the semi finals. At the same time, fans praised him for being good sports even when facing defeat. Zhang Jun, the President of the Chinese Badminton Association, then revealed that Chen&#x27;s less-than-ideal performance may have been due to a blister on the ball of his foot that had developed during the group stage of the competition and it was so bad that he could not run. He added that he was touched by Chen’s fighting spirit to continue playing. This news created a ripple of concern and worry towards his physical health, as he was already battling with previous back injuries. In September, Chen participated in the Chinese National Championships and declared that it will be his last.

== Retirement ==
After not competing on tour since the pandemic-induced postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Chen, at the age of 34, officially declared his retirement from professional badminton. The decision came after thoughtful discussions with his family, as Chen recognised the importance of prioritising the well-being of his loved ones and the pursuit of a more balanced family life. These factors played a significant role in influencing his choice to retire from the national team, marking the end of his illustrious badminton career.

== Honours and Awards ==
Due to stellar performance in badminton, Chen was awarded BWF male player of the year twice back-to-back in 2014 and 2015. His retainment of the World Championship crown in 2015 propelled him to be touted as one of the top athletes of the year in China. In 2024, Chen was inducted into the Badminton Hall of Fame in the same class as Lee Yong-dae, a former Korean Men&#x27;s and Mixed Doubles player.

== Personal life ==
Chen married former World No.1 badminton player Wang Shixian in 2017, after over a decade together. Wang gave birth to a son in June 2019.

Chen Long&#x27;s surname was actually pronounced Shèn but the word 谌 is pronounced chén when not used as a surname. As a result of this, mispronunciation happens a lot, and early in his career when he enrolled in China&#x27;s athlete system his surname was registered incorrectly as Chen. He tried to correct it but failed because of bureaucracy and finally let go of it.

<text>4DOS is a command-line interpreter by JP Software, designed to replace the default command interpreter codice_1 in Microsoft DOS and Windows. It was written by Rex C. Conn and Tom Rawson and first released in 1989. Compared to the default, it has a large number of enhancements.

4OS2 and 4NT are similar products that replace codice_2 in OS/2 and Windows NT respectively.

==Overview==
4DOS is most often used as a command-line replacement for the following operating systems:
* command-line: MS-DOS, IBM PC DOS, DR-DOS.
* graphical: Windows 95 to Windows 98, Windows 98SE.

Since Windows NT and Windows 2000 includes both codice_3 and codice_4, 4DOS and 4NT and derivatives can both be installed. Earlier versions of 4OS2 can be run under Windows NT, and OS/2 can run the two DOS and Windows NT shells, all three can be used on Windows NT-type machines and OS/2 multiple boot machines.

Among the many commands, statements and functions in 4DOS and lacking in DOS/Windows 95–98 codice_3 are reading keyboard input and a simpler method of working with colors of screen and text.

The default file extension for 4DOS scripts is .btm.

A graphical version of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT, called Take Command, was released with a feature set corresponding to version 4DOS 5.5, 4OS2, and 4NT 2.5 and updated after this. Development on this line stopped with the corresponding text mode versions. There was a graphical program Take Command/16, for Windows 3.1.

4OS2 is a similar replacement for IBM&#x27;s OS/2 command interpreter. This was first released at the same time as 4DOS version 4, and has a similar feature set. Like 4DOS, this is released as open source. It appeared in the feature set of 2011&#x27;s eComStation 2.10, in the freeware os2free project, and is included with ArcaOS.

4NT was first released as &quot;4DOS for Windows NT&quot; (versions 1.x, 2.x), but became 4NT until the restructure after version 8. The program is a recompilation of 4OS2, and continues to have features of OS/2&#x27;s command processor (codice_4), such as running REXX scripts, and EXTPROC support. A corresponding &quot;Take Command/32&quot; exists for this, version 1 corresponding to 4NT 2.5. 4NT and Take Command/32 were released in both ANSI (Windows 9x) and Unicode (Windows NT) forms, with the ANSI version dropped at version 5.

A new Win32 program Tabbed Command Interface (TCI), was released at the time of 4NT version 7. This program allowed one to attach (thereby reducing screen clutter) and detach tabbed consoles to a single window. This program requires Windows XP or later.

A new version of Take Command extends the original Tabbed Command Interface, expanded with extra windows to allow input to be composed, to graphically navigate directories and files, and extra features. 4NT is bundled as Take Command Console. A light feature-reduced version of TCC is released as a free download.

JP Software then released:
* TC (full pack of TCI + TCC)
* TCLE (TCI + TCC/LE)
* TCC (just the command utility)
* TCC/LE
This has been released from versions 9 to 12.1, corresponding to the underlying 4NT/TCC version.

== Features ==
4DOS features a number of enhancements compared to codice_3:

* Additional commands

==History and current status==
Originally distributed as shareware, 4DOS has been later released as unsupported freeware. Currently, the source code is available under a modified MIT License but it &quot;may not be used in any commercial product without written permission from Rex C. Conn&quot; and &quot;may not be compiled for use on any operating system other than FreeDOS&quot; – so does not qualify as open source as defined by Open Source Initiative.

The last update by JP Software was version 7.50.130, released in August 2004. During its 15-year history, 4DOS underwent numerous updates; here are a few of the most significant.

==NDOS==

Some versions of the Norton Utilities for DOS included modified copies of 4DOS called NDOS. The last version of NDOS was bundled with Norton Utilities 8, and corresponded to 4DOS 4.03.

<doc id="341329" wikidata="Q7188373" url="?curid=341329" title="Phuong Ngo">
<text>Phuong Canh Ngo (, ; born 1958) is an Australian former businessman and politician who was convicted of ordering the assassination of Australian MP John Newman on 5 September 1994.

==Biography==
Phuong Ngo was born in South Vietnam to wealthy parents and following university became a schoolteacher. Following the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War, his family had their assets confiscated. Ngo made several unsuccessful attempts to flee the country and was jailed several times. In January 1981, he made his thirteenth attempt, which was successful, and he arrived in Australia via Malaysia as a refugee in 1982. 

Ngo rose rapidly in local politics. On 26 September 1987, he was elected to the Cabramatta Ward of Fairfield City Council, New South Wales, making him the first Vietnamese-born Australian to enter local government; on his election, Ngo expressed to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;: &quot;I think we are welcome here. But we need a mutual understanding. Most people I talked to said we needed a Vietnamese on the council.&quot; The following year he partnered Rodney Adler to set up Asia Press Pty Ltd, which published &quot;Dan Viet&quot;, a Vietnamese language newspaper. As a city councillor, Ngo worked to help members of the Vietnamese Australian community and, after arranging for Adler to invest $1 million, led the redevelopment of the local community centre, the Mekong Club. He was subsequently asked to be the club&#x27;s president. From July 1990 to June 1993, Ngo served as a Commissioner of the NSW Ethnic Affairs Commission. In 1990, he was elected deputy mayor of Fairfield. The following year, Ngo was re-elected to Fairfield City Council at the September 1991 election and stood as an independent for the seat of Cabramatta in the May 1991 state election, which he lost to Labor&#x27;s John Newman.

After his friend and council ally, Nick Lalich, approached Federal MP Ted Grace for Ngo to join Labor, Grace arranged a meeting with Senator Graham Richardson and Leo McLeay, Federal MP for Watson and Speaker of the House of Representatives. They decided that if Ngo was promoted to the Legislative Council (MLC), he could be a potential &quot;counter&quot; to the Liberal Party&#x27;s Asian MLC Helen Sham-Ho. Ngo was invited to join Labor and run the party&#x27;s re-activated Canley Vale branch. This put him in direct competition with Newman, who ran the Canley Heights branch, despite previously agreeing not to challenge Newman for preselection.

==Political conflict==
Newman had been elected to the Fairfield council in 1977 and was known for his campaigns against Asian criminal gangs that were then a problem. Newman suspected Ngo took part in criminal dealings due to his involvement with the Mekong Club, which many believed to be laundering money for the Cabramatta gangs.

In 1990, the local &quot;Fairfield Champion&quot; newspaper published an article regarding a proposal to add an inscription commemorating the Chinese Communist Revolution to the Pai Lau gate (Freedom Gate) in Cabramatta&#x27;s Freedom Square. Ngo, then deputy mayor of Fairfield and an ardent anti-communist, blamed Newman for the proposal and sued the newspaper. The case was settled out of court. In 1991, Ngo stood as an independent for the seat of Cabramatta and Newman, who was the sitting member, issued a press release questioning Ngo&#x27;s refugee status. Ngo received only 11.7% of the vote, a result he blamed on his being Asian.

Following the election, Ngo joined Labor with the help of the Labor Right, led by Grace and his new Canley Vale branch, now directly competing with the Newman&#x27;s (Labor Left) Canley Heights branch. Ngo and Newman vied for new members, which led to considerable infighting over branch stacking. The ALP general secretary, John Della Bosca, arranged a meeting to resolve the dispute, during which Ngo agreed not to challenge Newman for pre-selection in exchange for Newman not challenging the credentials of members who joined Ngo&#x27;s branch. At this time Newman was being targeted: his car had been paint bombed three times and he was receiving death threats. Publicly he blamed a gang, but privately he confided in acquaintances that he believed it was Ngo &quot;and that gang of hooligans&quot; at the Mekong Club.
In 1994, Fairfield wanted a sister city. Ngo advocated a city from Taiwan, which was endorsed by councillors Lalich and Anwar Khoshaba; Newman, in line with official party policy, pushed for a city in China. A Taiwan relationship was against Australian Federal government policy, as Taiwan was not diplomatically recognised as a nation. According to former Cabramatta detective Tim Priest, Ngo had received a $117,000 cheque from Jin-Gou Chang of the Taipei Cultural Office in 1994. Newman learned of the transaction and accused Ngo, Lalich and Khoshaba of accepting funding from the Taiwanese government and stated that they should not be re-elected to the council, a position for which he received considerable support. The Hsinchu City sister city relationship was accepted despite only 100 Cabramatta citizens having Taiwanese ancestry. On 1 June, the Labor State Electoral Council condemned Ngo and Lalich, stating that if they continued to breach Labor policy regarding China, they would both be expelled. Ngo was furious and began openly approaching people who were not criminals for advice on acquiring guns and hiring a hitman.

==Assassination of John Newman==
John Newman, member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, was shot dead on 5 September 1994. Within days, the leader of a gang, 19-year-old Tri Minh Tran, became the prime suspect. Ngo&#x27;s conflict with Newman and his close ties to Tran led to widespread rumours in the community that he was involved which were repeated by the media. Ngo became the focus of police attention after one of Tran&#x27;s relatives made a statement to police that he had rejected an offer of $10,000 from Ngo to kill Newman. The case against Ngo was weak and, after Ngo provided information to police that led to the arrest of the informant, the task force investigating the Newman murder was disbanded.

It was not the first murder of a parliamentarian. In 1921 another Labor MP in the NSW Legislative Assembly, Percy Brookfield, was slain in Riverton, by a psychotic man.

==Trial==
Ngo was arrested for Newman&#x27;s murder on 13 March 1998, and following two mistrials, a Coronial Inquest, three Supreme Court trials and a Judicial Inquiry. After seven years since Newman’s death, he was found guilty and was convicted by a jury on 29 June 2001. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no parole or review.

==Aftermath==
In June 2003, evidence was found that Ngo was a member of the W2K (Willing To Kill) prison gang, leading to his transfer to the Goulburn Correctional Centre, a supermax prison. The High Court of Australia refused special leave to hear an appeal in May 2004.

Two of Ngo&#x27;s co-accused conspirators, David Dinh and Tu Quang Dao were acquitted by the same jury. The identity of the shooter and the getaway driver remains unknown.

A number of Ngo&#x27;s supporters have stated that he was convicted on flimsy evidence. He was a prominent leader in the Vietnamese Catholic community, which held prayer services for him in the hope that he would be acquitted of the murder. However, almost 300 leaders in the Vietnamese community signed a petition to the Supreme Court requesting that Ngo be denied bail.

In an enquiry after Newman&#x27;s death, but prior to charges being laid, evidence was heard that Newman considered the Mekong Club to be a &quot;gambling den&quot;. The prosecution in Ngo&#x27;s case claimed that Ngo and Newman were political rivals who competed for the same seat in Parliament. However, senior Labor figures, including Bosca, swore on oath that Ngo was not interested in Newman&#x27;s seat but rather in a seat in the Legislative Council.

In April 2005, China sponsored five Fairfield Council members to visit the country in order to improve the relationship that had deteriorated due to Ngo&#x27;s support of Taiwan.

An inquiry was launched into Ngo&#x27;s conviction on 6 June 2008, by order of Chief Justice James Spigelman of the New South Wales Supreme Court. The inquiry was overseen by former and Acting District Court judge, David Patten, and addressed several concerns raised as to the validity of the original conviction. On 17 April 2009, Patten ruled that the original conviction was sound.

Following the inquiry, calls were made to have Ngo&#x27;s name removed from monuments in Cabramatta. A former mayor and friend of Newman, Ken Chapman, claimed that this was unlikely to happen as Ngo had supporters on the council who had visited him in jail. Calls for the council to name a landmark in honour of Newman have not proceeded so far, although a swimming pool in Prairiewood bears his name.

<doc id="341331" wikidata="Q755186" url="?curid=341331" title="Doom II">
<text>Doom II, also known as Doom II: Hell on Earth, is a 1994 first-person shooter video game developed and published by id Software for MS-DOS. It was also released on Mac OS the following year. Unlike the original &quot;Doom&quot;, which was initially only available through shareware and mail order, &quot;Doom II&quot; was sold in stores. It was the first in the &quot;Doom&quot; franchise to be released initially in stores.

Compared to its predecessor, &quot;Doom II&quot; features larger levels, new enemies, a new Super Shotgun weapon, and a new power-up. &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot;, an expansion pack with 21 new levels, was released on December 26, 1995. Another expansion, &quot;No Rest for the Living&quot;, which adds nine extra levels, was developed for the release of the game on Xbox Live Arcade and is also included in the &quot;Doom 3: BFG Edition&quot;, as part of &quot;Doom Classic Complete&quot;, and as a free add-on for the 2019 Unity engine port of &quot;Doom II&quot;. It was also included in the 2024 KEX Engine port.

Reception of &quot;Doom II&quot; was very positive, with critics praising that the game refined the already good aspects of the original &quot;Doom&quot;. It has sold more than 1.8 million copies and earned over $74 million in revenue in the United States alone and is considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made.

&quot;Doom II&quot; was ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002, Tapwave Zodiac in 2004, on Xbox Live Arcade in 2010, and on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2019. The release of the &quot;Doom&quot; source code has facilitated ports to platforms including iOS and other cellphone systems. &quot;Doom II&quot; was included in the &quot;Doom&quot; ports for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1995 and 1997.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Doom II&quot; was not dramatically different from its predecessor. There were no major technological developments, graphical improvements, or substantial gameplay changes. Instead, the development team took advantage of advances in computer hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels. The game still consists of the player navigating large nonlinear levels. Each level is infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be picked up throughout the game. Levels are completed by finding an exit, whether it be a switch or a teleporter; the goal is simply to advance to the next area. As with its predecessor, &quot;Doom II&#x27;s&quot; levels can be completed in a straightforward fashion. However, because the levels are nonlinear players can wander off the beaten path, and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses, like health pickups and more powerful weapons. Due to the larger and more complicated maps with larger groups of monsters, the game had somewhat higher system requirements than the original.

Rather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first &quot;Doom&quot;, gameplay takes place over 32 levels (two of which are secret levels that can be accessed from level 15), albeit with interludes for when the story develops. Instead of watching the player&#x27;s progress on a map (as in the original episodes of &quot;Doom&quot;), the screens between each level simply show a background (a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of &quot;Doom&quot; available in &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, the retail re-release of the original &quot;Doom&quot;). This also means the player is never forced to lose all of their inventory after completing an episode.

&quot;Doom II&quot; doubled the number of non-boss monster types and started using bosses from the original &quot;Doom&quot; as normal level enemies, in addition to adding a new weapon, the super shotgun (a very powerful double-barreled shotgun), and a new power-up, the megasphere.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;Doom&quot;″s multiplayer functionality was greatly improved in &quot;Doom II&quot;, including &quot;out of the box&quot; support for a vastly increased number of dial-up modems. The two-player dial-up connection allowed one player to dial into the other player&#x27;s computer in order to play either cooperatively or in deathmatch-style combat. There was also local area network (LAN) functionality added, which was improved upon as patches and updates were released. This functionality was later incorporated into the original &quot;Doom&quot;. As with the original &quot;Doom&quot;, multiplayer games used to be played using the dial-up or LAN by the internal setup program (setup.exe), through the online service DWANGO or with once-popular programs like Kali and Kahn (using SPX) in Windows 95. Nowadays, in the modern standards, &quot;Doom II&quot; can be played with almost any version of Windows across the internet using third-party source ports such as &quot;Odamex&quot;, &quot;Zandronum&quot;, ZDaemon, and are still popular today. The Xbox Live Arcade port of &quot;Doom II&quot; supports online multiplayer via Xbox Live.

==Plot==
Immediately following the events in &quot;Doom&quot;, the player once again assumes the role of Doomguy. After defeating the Spider Mastermind, the marine finds a portal to Earth opened by demons. After returning to Earth, the marine finds that it has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.

The humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive spaceships which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Unfortunately, Earth&#x27;s only ground spaceport has been taken over by the demons, who placed a barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving. The marine battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors have escaped Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet.

Just as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved humanity, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in orbit, who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine&#x27;s own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side. He decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side, entering Hell.

After fighting through the hordes of Hell, the marine reaches the location of the biggest demon he has ever seen, called the Icon of Sin (Baphomet). He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth is sealed. The marine wonders where evil people will go when they die now that Hell has been destroyed, and reflects that rebuilding the world will be more fun than saving it as he begins his journey back home.

==Development==
Most of the levels were designed by Sandy Petersen, with American McGee playing a significant role as well. The final level, &quot;Icon of Sin&quot;, contains an easter egg where two of the artists put the severed head of John Romero as the sprite hidden behind the icon on the wall which must be damaged by rocket splash damage three times to win the game. Romero, while playing the level to work on its sound effects, accidentally stumbled upon this in-joke of himself. After realising what his co-workers had done, Romero himself answered by recording his voice saying &quot;To win the game, you must kill me, John Romero&quot;, putting it through various filters to distort it, then reverse the recording to create the &quot;demonic chant&quot; spoken by the head upon spotting the player. The photo that was scanned for the &quot;John Romero&#x27;s head&quot;-sprite was from a Businessweek photo shot in 1994. One of Petersen&#x27;s ideas that never made it to the final game was replacing the Fists weapon with a hand axe.

Advertising for the game was between $3 million and $5 million.

==Releases==
&quot;Doom II&quot; was released for DOS on October 10, 1994 (one of the days of the Doomsday rule and exactly ten months after the original) in North America and Europe; distribution was handled by GT Interactive.

The Mac OS version was ported by Lion Entertainment Inc. and released in 1995.

Ports for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn came included with the Doom ports released in 1995 and 1997 respectively.

A port for the Game Boy Advance was released in 2002, for the Tapwave Zodiac in 2004, for Xbox Live Arcade in 2010, and for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2019, with the latter-most platforms (with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions) receiving a further expanded port in 2024 alongside the original &quot;Doom&quot;.

An Atari Jaguar port was announced in early 1995 but it was never released. Likewise, a 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was announced to be in development by Art Data Interactive, but it never materialized.

The release of the &quot;Doom&quot; source code has facilitated ports to many other platforms, including iOS and other cellphone systems.

In August 2024, Bethesda announced a definitive edition of Doom and Doom II at QuakeCon. The new edition includes Doom, Doom 2, TNT: Evilution, The Plutonia Experiment, Master Levels for Doom 2, No Rest for the Living, Sigil (by John Romero), a new deathmatch map pack with 26 maps, and a new episode titled Legacy of Rust. Legacy of Rust was developed by id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames. The bundle also included in-game mod support across both titles.

==Expansions==
===&quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot;===
&quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot; is an official expansion pack for &quot;Doom II&quot; which was released on December 26, 1995 by id Software. The CD contains 20 WAD files created by various authors under contract. There is also a bonus called &quot;Maximum Doom&quot; consisting of over 3,000 homebrew levels. Romero wrote about the origin of the expansion in 2023. Back in 1995, some retailers were selling disks in stores that simply contained many &quot;Doom&quot; WADs scraped from the internet. Though the levels were available for free online, many players had slow internet access at the time and so would purchase the disks, which were &quot;selling like hot-cakes&quot;. Realising this, id decided to officially license a similar disk- by approaching mappers and commissioning them for levels, in addition to the large shareware collection. More broadly, the disk was part of an effort by Romero to diversify id Software&#x27;s income at a time when much of the team was waiting for the Quake engine to be ready. Reviewer Ed Dawson for &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot; praised the quality of the levels, but noted the &quot;uniformly medium size&quot; of the commercial levels and the high purchase price for predominantly shareware content.

===&quot;No Rest for the Living&quot;===
&quot;No Rest for the Living&quot; is an expansion pack developed for the release of &quot;Doom II&quot; on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. It was developed by Nerve Software, under the direction of id Software and was released on May 26, 2010. It consists of eight regular levels and one secret level. It is also included in the 2012 &quot;Doom II&quot; release from &quot;Doom 3: BFG Edition&quot;, as part of &quot;Doom Classic Complete&quot; for the PlayStation Network, and has been released as a free add-on for the 2019 Unity engine port of &quot;Doom II&quot;. Although no detailed plot information is given, this expansion appears to take place after the main campaign of &quot;Doom II&quot;. Brandon James, president of Nerve Software, said this expansion was designed to be played on Ultra-Violence difficulty, contains &quot;a plethora of secrets to find,&quot; and &quot;is geared toward a more hardcore experience.&quot;

===&quot;Legacy of Rust&quot;===
&quot;Legacy of Rust&quot; was developed by id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames. Released on August 8, 2024, &quot;Legacy of Rust&quot; is the first official episode since &quot;Doom II&quot; to feature brand-new enemies/weapons. The new episode is divided into two chapters, &quot;The Vulcan Abyss&quot; and &quot;Counterfeit Eden,&quot; which contain a combined total of 16 maps.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The reception of &quot;Doom II&quot; was positive, with reviewers saying it refined everything that made the original &quot;Doom&quot; good. The game was reviewed in 1995 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #216 by David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column, who stated that, &quot;if mindless but intense carnage is what you want, you&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth. It&#x27;s just not a must-have, keep-on-the-hard-drive-forever game. If you need to have more &quot;Doom&quot;, get this.&quot;

Writer/game designer Chris Crawford used the level &quot;Barrels O&#x27; Fun&quot; to illustrate a point about death in video games, explaining he chose the level as his example because it is &quot;one of the most complex and sophisticated challenges in one of the very best games of the 1990s&quot;.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Now that the first person interface has become the design of choice for the entire industry, Id will need to find new innovations, or it will quickly find it&#x27;s playing catch-up in its own game niche.&quot;

===Awards===
&quot;Doom II&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science fiction Computer Game of 1994&quot;.

===Sales===
According to David Kushner in &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;, id Software shipped 600,000 units of &quot;Doom II&quot; to stores in preparation for its launch. This initial shipment sold out within a month on shelves, despite its being expected to last for three months. Pre-orders for the game were so massive that it was difficult to buy from a store. The game products were displayed on pallets rather than shelves. The game was the United States&#x27; highest-selling software product of 1994, and sold more than copies within a year. It placed 10th for 1996, with 322,671 units sold and $12.6 million earned in the region that year alone. According to PC Data, which tracked sales in the United States, &quot;Doom II&quot; sold 1.81 million units and earned $74.7 million in revenue in the United States. This led PC Data to declare it the country&#x27;s third-best-selling computer game for the period between January 1993 and April 1998. Its revenues in that country ultimately reached $80 million, while those in Europe reached $20 million. Of the latter figure, Kushner wrote that &quot;30 percent [...] came from Germany—a country that had banned the game from its shelves.&quot;

In Australia, the game sold 10,000 copies in the first two days of its release.

===Legacy===
In 2022, John Romero created a new level called &quot;One Humanity&quot; for the game to raise money for the Ukrainian Red Cross, and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund following the outbreak of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. By March 2022, the new level had raised more than $29,000.

<text>Abū Mūsā Muḥammad bin [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] al-Amīn (; April 787 – 24/25 September 813), better known by his laqab of al-Amin (), was the sixth Abbasid caliph from 809 to 813.

Al-Amin succeeded his father, Harun al-Rashid, in 809 and ruled until he was deposed and killed in 813, during the civil war by his half-brother, al-Ma&#x27;mun.

==Early life and the issue of succession==
Muhammad, the future al-Amin, was born in April 787 to the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid () and Zubayda, herself descended from the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur ().

Muhammad had an elder half-brother, Abdallah, the future al-Ma&#x27;mun (), who had been born in September 786. However, Abdallah&#x27;s mother was a Persian slave concubine, and his pure Abbasid lineage gave Muhammad seniority over his half-brother. Indeed, he was the only Abbasid caliph to claim such descent. Already in 792, Harun had Muhammad receive the oath of allegiance (&quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot;) with the name of &quot;al-Amīn&quot; (&quot;The Trustworthy&quot;), effectively marking him out as his main heir, while Abdallah was not named second heir, under the name &quot;al-Maʾmūn&quot; (&quot;The Trusted One&quot;) until 799. Both brothers were assigned members of the powerful Barmakid family as tutors: al-Amin&#x27;s tutor was al-Fadl ibn Yahya, while al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s was Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya.
These arrangements were confirmed and publicly proclaimed in 802, when Harun and the most powerful officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma&#x27;mun would remain al-Amin&#x27;s heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged Khurasan. This was an appointment of particular significance, as Khurasan had been the starting-point of the Abbasid Revolution which brought the Abbasids to power, and retained a privileged position among the Caliphate&#x27;s provinces. Furthermore, the Abbasid dynasty relied heavily on Khurasanis as military leaders and administrators. Many of the original Khurasani Arab army (&quot;Khurasaniyya&quot;) that came west with the Abbasids were given estates in Iraq and the new Abbasid capital, Baghdad, and became an elite group known as the &quot;abnāʾ al-dawla&quot; (&quot;sons of the state/dynasty&quot;). This large-scale presence of an Iranian element in the highest circles of the Abbasid state, with the Barmakid family as its most notable representatives, was certainly a factor in the appointment of al-Ma&#x27;mun, linked through his mother with the eastern Iranian provinces, as heir and governor of Khurasan. The stipulations of the agreement, which were recorded in detail by the historian al-Tabari, accorded al-Mamun&#x27;s Khurasani viceroyalty extensive autonomy. However, modern historians consider that these accounts may have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma&#x27;mun in the latter&#x27;s favour. Harun&#x27;s third heir, al-Mu&#x27;tamin, received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire in Upper Mesopotamia and Syria.
These complex arrangements, sealed with mutual judicial and religious oaths, clearly demonstrate that Harun was conscious of their precariousness, in view of the profound differences between al-Amin and al-Ma&#x27;mun, both in character and in interests. Very quickly, this latent rivalry had important repercussions: almost immediately after the court returned to Baghdad in January 803, the Abbasid elites were shaken by the abrupt fall of the Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this event may reflect the fact that the Barmakids had become indeed too powerful for the Caliph&#x27;s liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the &quot;abnāʾ&quot; and al-Ma&#x27;mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was to have a chance to succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the &quot;abnāʾ&quot;, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad. This led to unrest in the provinces, especially Khurasan, where local elites had a long-standing rivalry with the &quot;abnāʾ&quot; and their tendency to control of the province (and its revenues) from Iraq. The harsh taxation imposed by a prominent member of the &quot;abnāʾ&quot;, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, even led to a revolt under Rafi ibn al-Layth, which eventually forced Harun himself, accompanied by al-Ma&#x27;mun and the powerful chamberlain (&quot;hajib&quot;) and chief minister al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, to travel to the province in 808. Al-Ma&#x27;mun was sent ahead with part of the army to Marv, while Harun stayed at Tus, where he died on 24 March 809.

==Caliphate==
When Harun al-Rashid died in March 809. (Harun had dismissed Ali and replaced him with Harthama ibn A&#x27;yan, and in 808 marched himself east to deal with the rebel Rafi ibn al-Layth, but died in March 809 while at Tus). Al-Amin smoothly succeeded him. The majority of army commanders on the Khorasan expedition decided to obey new caliph&#x27;s order to return to Baghdad. The rebel chose to surrender himself to Harun&#x27;s son and new governor of Khurasan, al-Ma&#x27;mun. He was pardoned, and nothing more is known of him after. Al-Amin continued the progressive moves of his father. The first two years of his reign were generally peaceful.

===Hostility towards al-Mamun===
Al-Ma&#x27;mun had mistrusted al-Amin before their father&#x27;s death and convinced Harun to take him with him on Harun&#x27;s last journey east. Although Harun had instructed the Baghdad commanders of this expedition to remain with al-Ma&#x27;mun, after Harun&#x27;s death they returned to Baghdad. Al-Amin sought to turn al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s financial agent in Rayy against al-Ma&#x27;mun and he ordered al-Ma&#x27;mun to acknowledge al-Amin&#x27;s son Musa as heir and return to Baghdad. Al-Ma&#x27;mun replaced his agent in Rayy and refused the orders. His mother was Persian and he had strong support in Iran.

The brothers had different mothers. Al-Amin was prompted to move against al-Ma&#x27;mun by meddlesome ministers, especially al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi&#x27;. He had Harun&#x27;s succession documents brought from Mecca to Baghdad, where he destroyed them. Then, he sent agents east to stir opposition to al-Ma&#x27;mun. However, a careful watch at the frontier denied them the opportunity. Al-Amin denied al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s request for his family and money and kept them in Baghdad.

===Internal rebellions===
Al-Amin faced unrest in Syria. He sent Abd al-Malik ibn Salih to restore order there. There was fierce fighting and Abd al-Malik died. Al-Amin sent Ahmad ibn Mazyad and Abdallah ibn Humayd east, each with an army (al-Tabari v. 31 p. 100 says each had 20,000 men). However, Tahir&#x27;s agents sowed discord and these two armies fought against each other.

Al-Amin faced an uprising in Baghdad led by Ali ibn Isa&#x27;s son Husayn. This was quelled and Husayn was killed.

===Civil war (811–813)===

Under the influence of their respective ministers, al-Amin and al-Ma&#x27;mun took steps that further polarized the political climate and made the breach irreparable. After al-Ma&#x27;mun symbolically removed al-Amin&#x27;s name from his coins and from the Friday prayer, in November 810 al-Amin removed al-Ma&#x27;mun and al-Mu&#x27;tamin from the succession and nominated his own sons Musa and Abdallah instead. Al-Ma&#x27;mun replied by declaring himself &quot;imam&quot;, a religious title which shied of directly challenging the Caliph but nevertheless implied independent authority, as well as hearkening back to the early days of the &quot;Hashimiyya&quot; movement which had carried the Abbasids to power.

Despite the reservations of some of his senior ministers and governors, two months later, in January 811, al-Amin formally began the civil war when he appointed Ali ibn Isa governor of Khurasan, placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40,000 men, drawn from the &quot;abnaʾ&quot;, and sent him to depose al-Ma&#x27;mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma&#x27;mun and carry him back to Baghdad.

In March 811 al-Amin dispatched an army under Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan against al-Ma&#x27;mun. Ali advanced on Rayy. Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s capable general Tahir bin Husain met and defeated Ali, who was killed.

Tahir took Ahwaz and gained control of Bahrayn and parts of Arabia. Basra and Kufa swore allegiance to al-Ma&#x27;mun. Tahir advanced on Baghdad and defeated a force sent against him. In Mecca, Dawud ibn Isa reminded worshippers that al-Amin had destroyed Harun ar Rashid&#x27;s succession pledges and led them in swearing allegiance to al-Mamun. Dawud then went to Marv and presented himself to al-Ma&#x27;mun. Al-Ma&#x27;mun confirmed Dawud in his governorship of Mecca and Medina.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Al-Amin&#x27;s only wife was Lubana bint Ali ibn al-Mahdi, who was noted for her exceptional beauty. However, al-Amin died before the consummation of his marriage to Lubanah; her attested poetry includes a lament for his death: &#x27;Oh hero lying dead in the open, betrayed by his commanders and guards. I cry over you not for the loss of my comfort and companionship, but for your spear, your horse and your dreams. I cry over my lord who widowed me before our wedding night&#x27;. 

One of his concubines was Fatm, also known as Nazm and Umm Musa. She was the mother of his son Musa. She died during his reign, and he mourned her loss deeply. When his mother Zubaydah learned of his sorrow, she came to offer him solace, by reciting fitting verses from poetry. Another concubine was Umm Abdullah. She was the mother of his son Abdullah. She was a poetess. Another concubine was Arib. She asserted that she was the daughter of Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya, a member of the Barmakid family, and claimed that she was abducted and sold as a child when the Barmakids lost their influence. Al-Amin acquired her and subsequently sold her to his brother al-Ma&#x27;mun. She gained recognition as a prominent poet, singer, and musician. Another concubine was Faridah. She was raised in the Hejaz. Initially, she served Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s chamberlain, al-Rabi&#x27; ibn Yunus, where she learned to sing. Later, she came under the ownership of the Barmakid family. However, after Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya&#x27;s death and the Barmakids&#x27; downfall, she went into hiding. Despite efforts by Caliph al-Rashid to find her, she remained elusive. Following al-Rashid&#x27;s death, she became the property of al-Amin, staying with him until his demise, after which she fled. She later married al-Haytham ibn Bassam and bore him a son named Abdullah. Upon al-Haytham&#x27;s death, she married al-Sindi ibn al-Harashi. Another concubine was Hadiyya. She was a singer, who had been trained and presented to al-Amin by his uncle Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi. Another concubine was Badhal. She had been formerly a concubine of al-Amin&#x27;s cousin Ja&#x27;far bin al-Hadi. She hailed from Medina and was raised in Basra. Described as charming with fair skin, she was praised for her musical talent, particularly her skill in playing instruments, and was known for her exceptional ability as a songwriter and singer. After al-Amin&#x27;s death, she became a concubine of Ali bin Hisham. Another concubine was Da&#x27;f. She was a songstress and was one of his favourites.

Al-Amin tried to nominate his sons, Musa and Abdullah, as heirs. Musa was born in 806, and passed away at a young age in December 823–January 824. Abdullah, who spent an extended period in the courts of subsequent caliphs, was the sole individual to continue the lineage of al-Amin.

=== Other relationships ===
According to the Muslim historian Al Tabari, Al-Amin fell madly in love with one of his male slaves named Kauthar, whom he had named after a river in heaven. In an effort to dissuade her son from Kauthar, al-Amin&#x27;s mother insisted that his female slaves dress in men&#x27;s attire to encourage him to engage in sexual relationships with them.

==Death==

In 812, Tahir advanced and set up camp near Baghdad&#x27;s Anbar Gate and besieged the city. The effects of this siege were made more intense by the rampaging prisoners who broke out of jail. There were several vicious battles, such as at al-Amin&#x27;s palace of Qasr Halih, at Darb al- Hijarah and the al-Shammasiyyah Gate. In that last one Tahir led reinforcements to regain positions lost by another officer. Overall the situation was worsening for al-Amin and he became depressed.

When Tahir pushed into the city, al-Amin sought to negotiate safe passage out. Tahir reluctantly agreed on the condition al-Amin turn over his sceptre, seal and other symbols of office. Al-Amin tried to leave on a boat, apparently with these symbols, rejecting warnings to wait. However, Tahir noticed the boat, and al-Amin was thrown into the water, swam to shore, was captured and then brought to a room, where he was executed. His head was placed on the Anbar Gate. Al-Tabari (v. 31 pp. 197–202) quotes Tahir&#x27;s letter to al-Ma&#x27;mun informing him of al-Amin&#x27;s capture and execution and the state of peace resulting in Baghdad.
When al-Amin was killed, one of Zubaidah&#x27;s eunuchs came to her and appealed to her to seek vengeance for al-Amin&#x27;s blood as Aisha sought vengeance for the blood of Uthman (According to Eunuch&#x27;s view). Zubaida, however, refused to do so. As al-Ma&#x27;mun refused to acknowledge al-Amin&#x27;s son Musa as heir, the throne went to al-Ma&#x27;mun.

<text>The &#x27; (), formally the &#x27; (), is a French &quot;grande école&quot; whose primary mission is to provide high-level fine arts education and training. The art school, which is part of the Paris Sciences et Lettres University, is located on two sites: Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris, and Saint-Ouen.

The Parisian institution is made up of a complex of buildings located at 14 rue Bonaparte, between the quai Malaquais and the rue Bonaparte. This is in the heart of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, just across the Seine from the Louvre museum. The school was founded in 1648 by Charles Le Brun as the famed French academy &quot;Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture&quot;. In 1793, at the height of the French Revolution, the institutes were suppressed. However, in 1817, following the Bourbon Restoration, it was revived under a changed name after merging with the Académie d&#x27;architecture. Held under the King&#x27;s tutelage until 1863, an imperial decree on November 13, 1863 named the school&#x27;s director, who serves for a five-year term. Long supervised by the Ministry of Public Instruction, the is now a public establishment under the Ministry of Culture.

==History==
The is the original of a series of in French regional centers. Since its founding in 1648, the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture has had a school, France&#x27;s elite institution of instruction in the arts. Its program was structured around a series of anonymous competitions that culminated in the &quot;grand prix de l&#x27;Académie Royale&quot;, more familiar as the Grand Prix de Rome, for its winner was awarded a bourse and a place at the French Academy in Rome. During his stay in Rome, a &quot;pensionnaire&quot; was expected to send regular &quot;envois&quot; of his developing work back to Paris. Contestants for the &quot;Prix&quot; were assigned a theme from the literature of classical antiquity; their individual identities were kept secret to avoid any scandal of favoritism.
With his final admission into the Académie, the new member had to present his fellow academicians a &quot;morceau de réception&quot;, a painting or sculpture that demonstrated his learning, intelligence, and proficiency in his art. Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s &quot;Andromache Mourning Hector&quot; was his reception offering in 1783; today it is in the collections of the Louvre Museum.

In 1793, during the French Revolution, the Académie Royale and the grand prix de l&#x27;Académie Royale were abolished, but only a few years later, in 1797, the Prix de Rome was re-established. Each year throughout the nineteenth century, the winner of the Prix de Rome was granted five years of study at the Villa Medici, after which the painter or sculptor could fully expect to embark on a successful official career.

The program resulted in the accumulation of some great collections at the Académie, one of the finest collections of French drawings, many of them sent as &quot;envoies&quot; from Rome, as well as the paintings and sculptures, usually the winners, of the competitions, or &quot;salons&quot;. Lesser competitions, known as the &quot;petits concours&quot;, took themes like history composition (which resulted in many sketches illustrating instructive moments from antiquity), expressions of the emotions, and full and half-figure painting.

In its role as a teaching institution, the École assembled a large collection of Italian and French etchings and engravings, dating from the 16th through the 18th century. Such prints published the composition of paintings to a wide audience. The print collection was first made available to students outside the Académie in 1864.

Today, studies include: painting, installation, graphic arts, photography, sculpture, digital media and video. provides the highest level of training in contemporary art production. Throughout history, many world-renowned artists have either taught or studied at this institution. The faculty is made up of recognized international artists. Theoretical courses permitting diverse approaches to the history of the arts complement studio work, which is supported by technical training and access to technical bases. The media center provides students with rich documentation on art, and organizes conferences, seminars, and debates throughout the year. The School buildings have architectural interest and house prestigious historical collections and an extensive fine arts library. The school publishes a dozen texts per year on different collections, and holds exhibitions ranging from the school&#x27;s collection of old-master drawings to the most up to date contemporary works, in the Quai Malaquais space and the Chapel throughout the year.

==Collections==
The school owns circa 450,000 items divided between artworks and historical books, making it one of the largest public art collections in France. The collection encompasses many types of artistic productions, from painting and sculpture to etching, furniture or decorated books and from all the periods of art history. Many pieces of the collection are artworks created by students of the School throughout its history but former students and scholars also contributed to enlarge the holdings with many gifts and donations to the institution. The collection consists in approximatively 2,000 paintings (including pictures by Nicolas Poussin, Anthony van Dyck, Hyacinthe Rigaud, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Hubert Robert and Ingres), 600 pieces of decorative arts, 600 architectural elements, nearly 15,000 medals, 3,700 sculptures, 20,000 drawings including works by Paolo Veronese, Primaticcio, Jacques Bellange, Michelangelo, Charles Le Brun, Nicolas Poussin, Claude Gellée, Dürer, Rembrandt, Ingres, François Boucher or Pierre Alechinsky, 45,000 architectural drawings, 100,000 etchings and engravings, 70,000 photographs (mainly form the period 1850–1914), 65,000 books dating from the 15th to the 20th century (3,500 for the 15th and 16th centuries), and 1,000 handwritten pieces of archive (letters, inventories, notes...) and also 390 important fragments or complete illuminated manuscripts.

==Campus==

The physical setting of the school stands on about two hectares in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés section of Paris. The main entrance at 14 Rue Bonaparte is flanked by colossal carved heads of Pierre Paul Puget and Nicolas Poussin (done in 1838 by Michel-Louis Victor Mercier).

Before 1816, Beaux-Arts students were taught elsewhere. This land had been the convent of the Petits Augustins, then the site of Alexandre Lenoir&#x27;s collection of architectural fragments from across France, the Musée des Monuments français (1795–1816), assembled here as a result of the destruction of churches and noble chateaux during the revolution.

In 1830, architect Félix Duban, a former student and winner of the Grand Prix de Rome, began a transformation of the site by demolishing a few existing houses, moving back the convent&#x27;s cloister on the right to produce a symmetrical courtyard, and designing the largest central building, the Palais des Études. Duban simply incorporated many of Lenoir&#x27;s historical fragments, notably the portal of the 1548 Château d&#x27;Anet, and in the courtyard a facade from the Château de Gaillon, since removed and returned to its original site in 1977.
In other ways Duban meant the entire complex as an open-air encyclopedia for artists and architects. The Palais des Études building features elaborate frescoes, the stairwells demonstrate various wall finishes, and the courtyard (glassed over by Duban in 1863) once held classical statuary and full-size copies of the columns of the Parthenon for study.

The core of the complex is a semi-circular award theater within the Palais, the Hémicycle d&#x27;Honneur, where the prizes were awarded. Duban commissioned Paul Delaroche to produce a great mural, 27 metres long, to represent seventy-five great artists of all ages, in conversation, assembled in groups. In the middle are three thrones occupied by the creators of the Parthenon: sculptor Phidias, architect Ictinus, and painter Apelles, symbolizing the unity of these arts. The mural took Delaroche three and a half years to complete, and it still stands as a powerful expression of the Beaux-Arts collaborative ideal.
Duban continued to expand and improve the complex for decades. Other major buildings include the 1820 Bâtiment des Loges, the modified cloister now called the Cour des Mûriers, the 1862 Bâtiment des Expositions which extended the campus to the Quai Malaquias, the Hôtel de Chimay built circa 1750 and acquired by the school in 1884, and a block of studios constructed circa 1945 in concrete by Auguste Perret.

<text>Ecclesall Ward—which includes the neighbourhoods of Banner Cross, Bents Green, Carterknowle, Ecclesall, Greystones, Millhouses, and Ringinglow—is one of the 28 electoral wards in the Sheffield district, in the county of South Yorkshire, England. It is located in the southwestern part of the city and covers an area of . The population of this ward in 2007 was 19,211 people in 7,626 households, reducing to 6,657 at the 2011 Census. Ecclesall ward is one of the four wards that make up the South West Community Assembly and one of five wards that make up the Sheffield Hallam Parliamentary constituency. The Member of Parliament is Olivia Blake, a Labour MP. Ecclesall is one of the least socially deprived wards in the entire country, with a 2002 deprivation score of 4.7—making it the 8,105th most deprived (hence 309th least deprived) ward out of 8,414 wards in the country. The demographic consists largely of white, middle-class families.

==History==
Evidence of early occupation of the area can be found in Ecclesall Woods. A cup and ring-marked stone was discovered in 1981, and has been dated to the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. It, and the area a diameter around it, is a scheduled ancient monument.

Ecclesall electoral ward was created 1934 when the old Ecclesall Bierlow ward was divided into Ecclesall, Broomhill and Hallam.

The boundaries of the ward include about half of the area that was historically known as Ecclesall Bierlow—one of the six &#x27;townships&#x27; that made up the old Parish of Sheffield. Ecclesall Bierlow encompassed most of the land between the River Sheaf and the Porter Brook from The Moor to Ringinglow. It also included the areas of Broomhall and Crookesmoor to the north of Porter Brook. Though this area contained numerous small villages and hamlets, there was never a village called Ecclesall. The parish of Ecclesall was formed on 1 April 1904 from &quot;Ecclesall Bierlow&quot;, on 1 April 1933 the parish was abolished and merged with Sheffield. In 1931 the parish had a population of 203,892. It is now in the unparished area of Sheffield.

In ancient times this area was part of the Barnsdale Forest that, together with Sherwood Forest, made up the forest of the Robin Hood legends. The River Sheaf was thought for a time to be a &quot;boundary&quot; between the kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia to the south. There is no historical proof of such a boundary as Northumbria stretched deep within Lindsey and modern Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire at different stages between the 6th and 11th century. What is thought to be the earliest historical record of this area refers to the submission of the local Northumbrian army to Egbert of Wessex and his invasion force at nearby Dore in 829.
 The name &quot;Ecclesall&quot; (either from &quot;Heeksel-Hallr&quot; meaning the witches&#x27; hill, or &quot;Eccles&quot; (church) &quot;halh&quot; (hollow)) is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086—at that time Ecclesall was a part of the manor of Hallam. The name Ecclesall/Eccleshall is thought to be of Anglo-Scandinavian origin. The name is first found about 150 years later in the name of Sir Ralphus De Ecclesall a Norman feudal overlord who had taken over lands in the area from native Northumbrian landlords after the Norman invasion. The De Ecclesall family gave land to Norman and French monks who had come to Britain after the invasion. At Beauchief they established a corn mill on the river Sheaf, which was part of Beauchief Abbey. Many of the buildings of Ecclesall corn mill can still be seen at the northern end of Millhouses park—the district of Millhouses taking its name from this mill. In payment for the mill the monks of Beauchief were to provide a canon to say prayers daily at the Ecclesall chapel. These services continued at the chapel until the Dissolution of the Monasteries when Beauchief Abbey was abandoned. The chapel was restored in 1622 but was demolished when the present church was built nearby in 1788.

Until the 19th century Ecclesall Bierlow was very sparsely populated—in 1801 there were just 5362 people. This changed with the coming of the industrial revolution and the subsequent expansion of nearby Sheffield and by 1831 the population had increased to 14,239. In 1837 the Ecclesall Bierlow Poor Law Union came into being. As well as Ecclesall Bierlow, this encompassed Nether Hallam, Upper Hallam, Beauchief, Dore, Norton, and Totley. A workhouse was built at Nether Edge, in 1929 the Ecclesall Bierlow Union &#x27;Workhouse&#x27; was renamed Nether Edge Hospital and it remained in use as a hospital into the 1990s. Part of the Union became Nether Edge Grammar and later Brincliffe Grammar School. In 1880, a group of men from Sheffield, several of whom were from this area, were put on trial after attending a fancy dress ball in Manchester, for soliciting sex with one another.

Historic sites within the ward include Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet and Shepherd Wheel (both now museums). Ecclesall Wood has many examples of white coal kilns and the grave of a wood collier who was killed here when his cabin burned down on 11 October 1786.

==Neighbourhoods==

===Banner Cross===
Banner Cross is a district of Sheffield centred on the intersection of Ecclesall Road and Psalter Lane. This district is split evenly between Nether Edge/Sharrow and Ecclesall Wards. Banner Cross Hall, an ancient esquire seat, was virtually rebuilt in 1820. The main place of worship is Banner Cross Methodist Church. The nearby Banner Cross pub gained infamy when the notorious criminal Charles Peace shot and killed Arthur Dyson in the passageway beside the pub on 29 November 1876. The base of an old stone cross still remained at Banner Cross in 1819. Addy (1888) suggested that the name derives from &quot;bæna kross&quot;, meaning the cross of prayers.

===Carter Knowle===
Carter Knowle or Carterknowle () lies south of Brincliffe Edge, between Ecclesall Road and Abbeydale. A residential area, which includes what was originally known as Knab Farm Estate. Housing was built on former farmland there, in the valley between Brincliffe Edge and the upper part of Carter Knowle Road during the late 1950s / early 1960s by local building firm Gleesons. The area was home to Sheffield College&#x27;s Bannerdale campus, but after its closure and demolition, a new educational academy, the Mercia School was opened on the site adjacent to Carter Knowle Road in September 2018.

===Ecclesall===
The district of Ecclesall () is centred roughly on Ecclesall parish church at the intersection of Carter Knowle Road and Ecclesall Road. The present church, dedicated to All Saints, was built in 1788, consecrated in 1789 and has been altered several times since. Banner Cross Hall, also in the area, was built in 1820.

===Greystones===
Greystones () lies to the north of the district of Ecclesall. It is on a headland overlooking the Porter valley to the north and west.

===Millhouses===

Millhouses () lies to the south of the district of Ecclesall. Its origins lie in a small hamlet that grew around the Ecclesall Corn Mill.

===Bents Green===
Bents Green () lies to the west of the district of Ecclesall

===Ringinglow===

Ringinglow () is a village on the western border of Ecclesall Ward. Although it is within the boundary of the City of Sheffield, it is self-contained, entirely surrounded by open countryside. It is focussed on the intersections of Fulwood Lane and Houndkirk Road with Ringinglow Road.

==Transport==
Ecclesall Road is the main road (A625) from central Sheffield to the south-west, at first following the Porter Brook, then running through Ecclesall and Dore. The road is a major shopping area. Attractions including the Sheffield Botanical Gardens and the Sheffield General Cemetery lie alongside it, as does one of the campuses of Sheffield Hallam University. Abbeydale Road South (A621) is another major road that runs through the ward. The Midland Main Line railway line runs along the southern boundary of the ward, though the closest stations are outside of the ward at Sheffield and Dore &amp; Totley. The former Millhouses &amp; Ecclesall station was closed on 10 June 1968. The Sheffield Supertram currently has no routes through Ecclesall ward, but a planned extension to Dore would skirt the southern boundary.

==Parks and recreation==
About half of Ecclesall ward is made up of rural areas, parkland, or woodland. These areas include a large portion of the Ecclesall Woods, an area of ancient woodland that is known locally for being a bluebell wood. In the north section of the ward is Bingham Park, Whiteley Woods and part of the Porter valley; Millhouses Park marks the ward&#x27;s southern boundary. The ward also includes some of Whirlow Brook Park and the Limb Valley. The Sheffield Round Walk skirts the ward, running through a number of these parks.

==Education==
There are two secondary schools within Ecclesall ward, High Storrs School and Silverdale School. The ward also includes Ecclesall Primary School (formerly Ecclesall Infants) and Clifford All Saints C Of E Primary School (formerly Ecclesall Junior School), Dobcroft Junior School, Greystones Primary School, Mylnhurst Convent School, and St Wilfrid&#x27;s Primary School.

<doc id="341350" wikidata="Q775742" url="?curid=341350" title="Barry John">
<text>Barry John (6 January 1945 – 4 February 2024) was a Welsh rugby union fly-half who played in the 1960s and early 1970s during the amateur era of the sport. John began his rugby career as a schoolboy playing for his local team Cefneithin RFC before switching to the first-class west Wales team Llanelli RFC in 1964. Whilst at Llanelli, John was selected for the Wales national team—as a replacement for David Watkins—to face a touring Australian team.

In 1967, John left Llanelli RFC for Cardiff RFC where he formed a partnership with Gareth Edwards: one of the most famous half-back pairings in world rugby. From 1967, John and Edwards made an inseparable partnership with rugby selectors, being chosen to play together at all levels of the sport, for Cardiff, Wales, the Barbarians and in 1968 for the British Lions&#x27; tour of South Africa. The tour ended prematurely for John when he suffered a broken collarbone in the first Test match against the South African national team.

In 1971, the Wales national team entered what is considered their second &#x27;Golden Age&#x27;, with a team rich in experience and talent. John was part of the team that won the 1971 Five Nations Championship, the first time Wales had achieved a Grand Slam win since 1952. He then cemented his reputation as one of the sport&#x27;s greatest players with his pivotal role in the British and Irish Lions winning tour over New Zealand in 1971. On the 1971 tour, John played in all four Tests, playing some of his finest rugby and finishing as the Lions&#x27; top Test scorer.

John won 25 caps for the Wales national team and 5 for the British Lions. His excellent balance whilst running—along with precision kicking—made him one of the great players of the modern era. He retired from rugby at the age of 27, as Wales&#x27;s highest points scorer, citing the pressure of fame and expectation for his decision.

==Rugby career==

===Early career with Llanelli===
Barry John was born in Cefneithin, Carmarthenshire, in Wales on 6 January 1945. He attended Cefneithin Primary, and there he was fortunate to receive skilled rugby teaching. The headmaster, William John Jones, and teacher Ray Williams, were both former Wales international rugby players. Despite his natural talents, he never played at schoolboy level for Wales, but represented both his school and his local village team, Cefneithin RFC. He once played a game for rival team Pontyberem while still a schoolboy, but John recalls in his autobiography that the local resentment at making such a sporting faux pas ensured he never did so again.

John was then educated at Gwendraeth Grammar School in the Gwendraeth Valley, north of Llanelli and while still a teenager he made his first top-flight rugby appearance for Llanelli, on 4 January 1964, in an encounter with Moseley. Although Llanelli lost the encounter, John scored a try and converted it, and played in four more matches for the Llanelli senior team towards the end of the season. He continued to represent Llanelli while at Trinity College, Carmarthen, and gained a reputation as a kicking fly-half with a penchant for putting over dropped goals. During the 1964/65 season, John began to make an impact on the Welsh club scene. His dropped goal against Aberavon on 26 October 1964, only 17 games in, was his 11th of the season.

John gained more attention the following season. A win over Swansea, where he scored two dropped goals, was described by the &quot;Llanelli Star&quot; as being down to the &quot;genius of one player, Barry John&quot;. He almost missed the second away encounter of the season with Swansea when he was &#x27;held to ransom&#x27; by his fellow students at Trinity College. He was only released when Llanelli&#x27;s club chairman, Elvet Jones, promised to make a donation to the college &quot;rag&quot;. Llanelli won all four fixtures against Swansea that season, John scoring in all of them. As well as his two dropped goals in the first away fixture, he scored another in the second away game and a try in both the home matches at Stradey Park. In the 1965/66 season John was chosen to play in trial matches for the Wales national team. Although he was not picked, he was chosen as reserve to regular fly-half David Watkins.

During the 1966/67 season, John was again chosen to trial for Wales. One of the trials forced him to miss the second Swansea encounter of the season, played away on 12 November 1966; his place in the Llanelli team was given to a youth debutant from the Felinfoel club, Phil Bennett. Bennett became one of the greatest fly-halves produced by Wales, but he was kept from the Wales squad in his early career by the presence of John. In 1966, John was awarded his first international cap for Wales, taking Watkins&#x27; place at fly-half for the match against the touring Australia team. This was seen as a surprise move by the Welsh Rugby Union selectors, as Watkins had recently returned from a British Lions tour where he was team captain. Wales lost to Australia 11–4, the first time the Welsh had been beaten by the &#x27;Wallabies&#x27;, due to poor form in the midfield, with the criticism aimed at John, Gerald Davies and John Dawes. Although experiencing defeat in his first international, John managed to gain revenge over Australia just over a month later when the same team faced Llanelli at Stradey Park. Llanelli beat the Wallabies 11–0 after a bruising forward contest. John himself scored a try, and then added to his tally with a dropped goal.

Despite the Wales loss against Australia, the selectors kept faith with John, and he retained his place for the next Wales international. Played away from home, the opener of the 1967 Five Nations Championship against Scotland had him paired at half-back with Cardiff&#x27;s Billy Hullin. John played badly while carrying a leg injury, and the next match he was dropped, replaced by the more experienced Watkins.

===Joining Cardiff===
In the 1967/68 season, John left Llanelli and joined Cardiff, where he formed a partnership with Gareth Edwards. Although John and Edwards later became the scourge of New Zealand, their first international pairing had an inauspicious start. On 11 November 1967, the pair played their first international together, facing Brian Lochore&#x27;s touring New Zealand team. Edwards, like John, had two international games to his name, paired with Watkins in the final two matches of the 1967 Five Nations Championship. John regained his international place after Watkins had switched to professional rugby league just the month before, joining Salford for a club record fee of £16,000. Wales had an error-strewn game, in a match played in a cutting, rain-laden wind which turned the pitch into a muddy field. Wales captain Norman Gale won the toss and chose to play the first half into the gale, and finished the half 8–0 down. John raised Welsh hopes with an early dropped goal, his first international points, but a panicked blind back pass from Wales&#x27; number 8, John Jeffery, gifted Bill Davies an easy try. The game ended 13–6 to New Zealand, with Edwards looking uncomfortable throughout, and John&#x27;s kicking inaccurate, there was little to suggest the pair would become one of the great half-back pairings in rugby history.
Just over a month after playing for Wales against New Zealand, John faced the tourists again, this time as part of an East Wales team, made up of players from Cardiff, London Welsh and Bridgend. The New Zealand &#x27;All Blacks&#x27; were under pressure throughout the match, with John kicking from deep and away from the opposing forwards, allowing his team to make rushes on the &#x27;All Black&#x27; defence. After 22 minutes East Wales took the lead when a missed drop goal attempt from John was collected by Cardiff wing Frank Wilson for a try. A defensive lapse from the East Wales team allowed an equalising try, but with the score at 3–3, East Wales dominated the last ten minutes of the match. With the last kick of the match, John had space for one final dropped goal, but his kick sailed inches outside the post. The New Zealanders were glad to escape with the draw and finished the tour without losing a single match. Three days after turning out for East Wales, John and Edwards were paired to face the same New Zealand team, this time played at Twickenham for invitational touring side the Barbarians. The half-time result of 3–3 flattered the Barbarians, who were out-played in the forward positions, but the team took the lead early in the second half when a perfect diagonal kick to the corner by John resulted in a try by England&#x27;s Bob Lloyd. The Barbarians defended strongly for twenty minutes, but lost to two very late tries.

Both John and Edwards were selected for all four matches of the 1968 Five Nations Championship. The first match, away at Twickenham to England, recorded Wales coming from 11–3 down to draw 11 all. Both half-backs were on the score sheet, Edwards with a try, John with one of his trademark dropped goals. After a home win over Scotland, Wales lost to both Ireland and, eventual Championship winners, France. At club level, John finished the season with a total of nine tries and nine dropped goals for Cardiff.

===1968 British Lions, the 1969 Triple Crown and Wales tour===
John was selected for the British Lions in their tour of South Africa in 1968, but played in just four games before an injury forced him to return home. He played in three matches against district teams, Western Province, South Western Districts and , all wins for the tourists. He was then selected for the First Test, played at Johannesburg, against the South Africa national team. John&#x27;s first Test for the British Lions lasted for only fifteen minutes, when after running for the line he was tackled by Jan Ellis, and John broke his collarbone on landing on the hard ground.

John played infrequently for Cardiff during the 1968/69 season, making just 14 appearances. Despite this he was available for all matches in the 1969 Five Nations Championship, again playing in each match paired with Edwards. The Welsh selectors had dropped five players from the previous Championship, and notable debutants in the team to face Scotland at Murrayfield on 1 February 1969 were J.P.R. Williams and Mervyn Davies. John scored his first international try in the encounter after charging down a kick and dummying his way over. Scotland, who were under enormous pressure from the kick-off, lost 17–3.

When Ireland came to Cardiff Arms Park in March the team was on a seven-match unbeaten run, and were looking at taking the Grand Slam after defeating England, France and Scotland. It therefore came as a surprise at the ease with which the Welsh pack dominated. Wales won 24–11, with Dai Morris the stand-out Welsh player, though John also had one of his best matches, keeping pressure on the Irish with long touch kicks and scoring with a dropped goal.

Despite out-scoring France in tries scored, the match at Stade Colombes ended in an 8–8 draw, preventing a Welsh Grand Slam, though a win in the last match to England would give Wales the Championship. The England decider is best remembered for Maurice Richards&#x27; four tries, but John too was on the scoresheet with a dropped goal and a try of his own. The game finished 30–9 to Wales, giving John his first Championship title and making him a Triple Crown–winning player, as Wales had beaten all three other Home Nation teams.

Before the end of the season, John took part in his one and only seven-a-side tournament for Cardiff when he participated in the 1969 Snelling Sevens tournament. Cardiff progressed to the final, where they succeeded in beating John&#x27;s former club Llanelli. As well as the title, John won the &quot;Bill Everson – Player of the Tournament&quot; award.

With the end of the 1968/69 season, the Welsh Rugby Union sent a team to tour New Zealand and Australia. At half-back, Wales sent John, Edwards, Phil Bennett and Chico Hopkins, but in all three Tests, two against the New Zealand &quot;All Blacks&quot; and one against Australia, Welsh coach Clive Rowlands kept faith with John and Edwards. The Welsh team were completely overwhelmed by the All Blacks, losing both Tests, 0–19 and 12–33. A change of tactics by Rowlands, by switching Gerald Davies to the right wing, gave Wales a victory over Australia, and a six-try victory over Fiji (in which John was replaced by Bennett), helped the team gain a warm reception on their return to Britain.

===South Africa, the 1970 Championship and the 1971 Grand Slam===
On 13 December 1969, Cardiff played host to the sixth touring South Africa team. The tour is remembered for the anti-apartheid protests that followed the team, and before the match 1,500 protesters had marched through the Welsh capital. John was unavailable for the encounter having fractured a rib while playing for the Barbarians against an Oxford University Past and Present team eleven days earlier. His place was taken by Beverley Davies and Cardiff lost 17–3. John recovered in time for the South Africa against Wales match on 24 January, and was selected alongside Edwards. The game was played in atrocious muddy conditions, and a last minute try from Edwards snatched a 6–6 draw. Both John and Edwards had a substandard game that day, but they combined well in the last move of the game to avoid defeat. A week later on 31 January, John and Edwards faced the South Africans again, this time as part of the Barbarians. The South Africans produced their best play of the tour to come from behind to win 21–12.

There was little rest for the two Cardiff half-backs when on 7 February 1970, they were called back into the Wales team for the first match of the 1970 Five Nations Championship, a home encounter at Cardiff Arms Park against Scotland. Despite Scotland being 9–0 ahead at one point, Wales took the initiative and scored four tries without reply, winning 18–9. The England game was John and Edwards&#x27; 15th Wales international together, in an away match which recorded the largest haul of tries for the Welsh team in England since 1908. John scored one of the tries along with a dropped goal. Due to an injury to Edwards, John finished the game alongside Chico Hopkins. With only Ireland standing in front of a Welsh Triple Crown win, hopes were high, but Ireland, made John and Edwards look ordinary in a 14–0 defeat. John was unavailable for the final game of the tournament to France, his place taken by Phil Bennett. Wales beat France and shared the Championship with the French.

The 1971 Five Nations Championship was a new dawn for Welsh rugby. The new National Stadium was completed, and the team now into their Second Golden era were both experienced and talented. John and Edwards played in all four games, starting with an easy win over England. Wales won 22–6, with John scoring six points from two dropped goals. The second game of the Championship, played against Scotland, was a close encounter, won by Wales 19–18 thanks to a late Gerald Davies try converted by John Taylor. Barry John scored eight of Wales&#x27; points, with a try, penalty goal and a conversion; missing only his trademark drop goal to complete a &quot;full house&quot; of scores. John surpassed his Scotland tally in the next match, a home game against Ireland, scoring 11 points with a dropped goal, conversion and two penalty goals. Seen as one of Wales&#x27; more accomplished victories, the 23–0 win gave the team a Triple Crown title, and set up a Grand Slam encounter with France. Despite the low score, the 9–5 win over France at Stade Colombes on 27 March was a match of the highest quality. Edwards and John scored all the points in the encounter, Edwards with a try, John a try and a penalty goal. This was Wales&#x27; first Grand Slam since 1952 and the 1971 squad is seen as the greatest ever to be fielded by Wales.

===1971 British Lions===
In 1971, on their tour of New Zealand, John was again selected for the British Lions. With the painful memories of the woeful 1969 Wales Tour to New Zealand, John was determined to succeed with the Lions. Under the management of Doug Smith and the coaching of Carwyn James (also from Cefneithin), John rose to great individual heights with his match-winning performances. Of the 26 tour matches, he played in 17, only bettered by captain John Dawes and &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; prop Ian McLauchlan. By the time of the first Test in Carisbrook, John had faced six teams, including the New South Wales Waratahs and the New Zealand Māori. All six games had been won by the Lions and John had recorded 88 points, including a &quot;full house&quot; against Waikato. In the First Test John terrorised New Zealand&#x27;s fullback Fergie McCormick with ruthless tactical kicking. The All Blacks were shunted all over the field by John, who was well protected by his forwards, something that he was not afforded with Wales in 1969. The Lions won the Test 9–3, six of the Lions&#x27; points coming from two John penalties; McCormick never played for the All Blacks again.

Before the second Test John played in two more tour matches; wins over Southland and New Zealand Universities, in which he scored 32 points. In the game against the Universities John scored one of his most famous tries. John dummied a drop-goal before running through the Universities&#x27; defence, stepping inside the final tackler before touching the ball down under the posts, stunning the home crowd. The second Test, played at Christchurch, finished with the series drawn after New Zealand won 22–12, John scoring half of the Lions points. In between the second and third Tests, John played in three of the four regional matches, scoring 37 points including two tries in the game against Wairarapa.

A win in the third Test was vital to keep the Lions hope of a series win alive. John scored ten points of the 13–3 win, the other three coming from Wales&#x27; team-mate Gerald Davies. The final Test ended in a 14–14 draw, giving the series to the tourists. John scored eight of the Lions points, having scored in every match, Test and regional, he had played in.

It was on this tour that John received the nickname &quot;The King&quot; from the New Zealand press, though as early as 1965, he remembered being dubbed &quot;King John&quot; by a newspaper sub-editor while still at Llanelli. He scored 30 of the Lions 48 points over the four Tests, scored a record 191 points across the tour (6 tries, 31 conversions, 8 dropped goals and 27 penalties) and cemented his reputation as one of the game&#x27;s greatest players.

===1972 Championship and retirement===
John&#x27;s final season with Wales ended disappointingly as both Scotland and Wales refused to travel to Ireland due to the increased violence in Northern Ireland and the events of Bloody Sunday. Despite this, John had a good Championship, scoring 35 points in the three games against England, Scotland and France. The opener, away to England, was won 12–3, with John scoring two penalty goals and converting a J. P. R. Williams try. This was followed by a win over Scotland, in which John played well, converting three of the five Welsh tries and scoring three penalty goals. John&#x27;s final international was at home to France. He successfully converted four penalty goals in a 20–6 victory to Wales, and in scoring his final penalty surpassed the Wales international points-scoring record of Jack Bancroft set nearly 60 years earlier. The Welsh Rugby Union&#x27;s refusal to allow travel to Ireland stole the team&#x27;s possibility of a consecutive Grand Slam title.

In 1972, at the age of only 27, with 25 Wales caps and 5 British Lions caps, Barry John retired from the game. John cited the media attention and the unfair expectations of his country as reasons, believing he was &quot;living in a goldfish bowl&quot;. John recalled one incident that moved him to retire was while doing a promotion at a bank; &quot;Inside I said a few words and as I was being introduced to someone she curtsied... That convinced me this was not normal, I was becoming more and more detached from real people. I didn&#x27;t want this any more.&quot;

His 25 caps for Wales resulted in 90 points scored, 5 tries, 9 conversions, 13 penalties and 8 dropped goals. His British Lions career added a further 30 international points, with a single try, 3 conversions, 5 penalties and 2 dropped goals. For Cardiff he played 5 seasons, playing 93 matches, during which he scored 24 tries and 30 dropped goals. His dropped goal total for Cardiff was the club&#x27;s second highest total, drawn with Wilf Wooller but short of Percy Bush&#x27;s tally of 35.

===International games===
==Critical reception==
As the authors of the official history of the Welsh Rugby Union, David Smith and Gareth Williams wrote of John: The clue to an understanding of his achieved style lies in what he could make others do to themselves. The kicking, whether spinning trajectories that rolled away or precise chips or scudding grubbers, was a long-range control, but his running, deft, poised, a fragile illusion that one wrong instant could crack, yet rarely did, was the art of the fly-half at its most testing. He was the dragonfly on the anvil of destruction. John ran in another dimension of time and space. His opponents ran into the glass walls which covered his escape routes from their bewildered clutches. He left mouths, and back rows, agape.

Gareth Edwards, in his 1978 autobiography, when describing John, wrote: He had this marvellous easiness in the mind, reducing problems to their simplest form, backing his own talent all the time. One success on the field bred another and soon he gave off a cool superiority which spread to others in the side. Physically he was perfectly made for the job, good and strong from the hips down and firm but slender from the waist to the shoulders.

J.P.R. Williams regarded John as &quot;“Without doubt, the greatest player I played with.&quot;

Gerald Davies, who played with John for Wales and the British Lions, in his 1971 autobiography described Edwards as &quot;fiery and impulsive&quot;, but John was &quot;fairer, aloof and apart. Whilst the hustle and bustle went on around him he could divorce himself from it all; he kept his emotions in check and a careful rein on the surrounding action. The game would go according to his will and no-one else&#x27;s ...&quot;

Rodney Webb, who represented England between 1967 and 1972, is quoted as saying &quot;Barry John&#x27;s punting was phenomenal. He could drop the ball on a sixpence and he could do it every time&quot;. Webb, who developed the modern rugby ball, believes that John cannot be compared to modern kickers because &quot;the modern ball is coated in a laminate, has dimpled surfaces, unobtrusive lacing and multi panels. In the seventies the balls soaked up water, swerved all over the place and were placed in the mud and slime when kicking for goal&quot;.

John came third in the 1971 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, beaten by winner Princess Anne and runner-up George Best. He was one of the inaugural inductees of the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997 and in 1999 was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame. In 2015 he was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.

===Amateurism===
As an amateur rugby union player, John was not paid to play rugby at club or international level. To receive money for playing would have been recognised as an act of professionalism and would have resulted in action from one of the governing unions, normally suspension or a ban. To prevent players switching to professional rugby league, players were given boot money by their clubs or sponsors, named after the early practice of placing money in the players&#x27; boots. In his 2011 book &quot;Appy&quot;, businessman and football manager Meirion Appleton said that in the 1970s he made illegal payments to both John and Gareth Edwards. Appleton said that before an international match he gave both players envelopes containing money from sportswear manufacturer Adidas. John was never charged with taking illegal payments during his career.

==Personal life==
John was born at Low-land, a smallholding at Cefneithin in Carmarthenshire, Wales. He was the second child of William and Vimy John; his brother Delville was three years his senior. John had a further four siblings, Alan, Clive, Madora and Diane. All three of his brothers played rugby. Delville played for Cefneithin, captaining them for two seasons; Alan progressed from the local club to Llanelli and also toured Argentina with Wales; while Clive was a Llanelli wing forward who was selected for Wales &#x27;B&#x27;. The family went to live at Foelgastell, staying with an uncle and aunt, shortly after John&#x27;s birth but returned to Cefneithin when John was two. His early schooling was at Cefneithin Primary, and after failing his eleven-plus exam he spent a year at Cross Hands senior centre. He passed the entrance exam and was accepted into Gwendraeth Grammar School at Drefach.

At the age of 18, he left grammar school and was awarded a place at Trinity College, Carmarthen, with ambitions of becoming a teacher. He studied physical education, junior science and horticulture. He left Trinity in the summer of 1967, and took up a post as a physical education teacher at Monkton House School in Cardiff, a private school for boys between the ages of eight and sixteen. John moved to Cardiff and shared a house with several other rugby players, including former Llanelli team mate Gerald Davies. John quit his position at Monkton House when he toured South Africa in 1968 and never taught again. On his return from Africa, John moved back to his family home at Cefneithin. He spent six weeks unemployed and during this period he considered turning to professional rugby league, almost signing for St Helens.

Following an interview with David Coleman for the BBC programme, &quot;Sportsnight&quot;, in which his jobless situation was discussed, John was offered a job working for Forward Trust, a finance company in Cardiff. When John quit playing rugby in 1972, he also left his job as a finance representative, signing a contract to write a weekly column and cover important matches for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. He was also signed to take part in sport programmes presented by HTV, the Wales and West of England commercial television company.

In September 1969, John married Janet Talfan Davies, daughter of Alun Talfan Davies QC, a leading Welsh lawyer. John and Jan had four children; they later separated.

In 2001, John ran a Chinese restaurant near Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium.

In 2009, he decided to sell his rugby memorabilia, including his Wales caps, stating that he felt no nostalgia towards the items, and the honour of playing for Wales was all that mattered.

John died in Cardiff on 4 February 2024, at the age of 79. A family statement read: &quot;Barry John died peacefully today at the University Hospital of Wales surrounded by his loving wife and four children. He was a loving Dadcu [grandfather] to 11 grandchildren and a much-loved brother.&quot;

<doc id="341354" wikidata="Q7350550" url="?curid=341354" title="Robert Jackson (Wantage MP)">
<text>Robert Victor Jackson (born 24 September 1946) is a British politician. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1979 to 1984 and member of parliament (MP) for Wantage from 1983 to 2005, having been elected as a Conservative; however, he joined the Labour Party in 2005.

==Early life==
Jackson was raised in Nkana, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where his father worked on the copper mines. He was educated at Falcon College in Rhodesia and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he rose to the presidency of the Oxford Union. He was then elected to a fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford, one of the UK&#x27;s most prestigious academic distinctions. He had worked as a political advisor to senior ministers prior to being elected and also as political advisor to the Governor of Rhodesia, Lord Soames, during its transition to independence as Zimbabwe. He edited the &quot;Round Table Journal&quot; from 1970 to 1974.

==Parliamentary career==
At the October 1974 general election, Jackson stood in Manchester Central, a safe seat for the Labour Party, without success. At the 1979 European Parliament election, he was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Upper Thames; he played a prominent role on the European Parliament&#x27;s budget committee.

At the 1983 general election, Jackson was elected to the House of Commons as MP for Wantage. He was subsequently appointed as a junior minister at the Department of Education and Science (1987–90), the Department of Employment (1990–92) and the Office of Public Service and Science (1992–93).

==Resignation==
On 15 January 2005, Jackson defected to the Labour Party, stating that the Tories had &quot;incoherent&quot; policies on public services, &quot;dangerous&quot; views on Europe, and had &quot;wobbled&quot; on the issue of Iraq. In a letter to his constituency chairman, he wrote: &quot;It is in the country&#x27;s best interest that Tony Blair rather than Michael Howard should form the next government.&quot; Jackson, who had been on the liberal and pro-European wing of the Conservatives, was one of the few Tory MPs who supported the reduction in the age of consent for gay men. He had been treasurer of the Conservative Mainstream association, and supported Kenneth Clarke in the 2001 leadership election.

Before defecting, Jackson had indicated he would not stand in the forthcoming general election, following Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s election as Conservative leader, and he duly stepped down in April 2005. At the 2005 general election, Jackson was succeeded by Ed Vaizey, a prominent conservative columnist and pundit who had been selected by the local Conservative Association.

Despite his defection, Jackson has continued to vote for the Conservative Party at subsequent elections. In March 2024, he suggested that he would not want to vote for them again, stating, &quot;They&#x27;re losing comprehensively in the culture wars.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jackson is married to Caroline Jackson, a former Member of the European Parliament.

<doc id="341356" wikidata="Q6942376" url="?curid=341356" title="Music of the Lesser Antilles">
<text>The music of the Lesser Antilles encompasses the music of this chain of small islands making up the eastern and southern portion of the West Indies. Lesser Antillean music is part of the broader category of Caribbean music; much of the folk and popular music is also a part of the Afro-American musical complex, being a mixture of African, European and indigenous American elements. The Lesser Antilles&#x27; musical cultures are largely based on the music of African slaves brought by European traders and colonizers. The African musical elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous West African tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from India. In many ways, the Lesser Antilles can be musically divided based on which nation colonized them.

The former British colonies include Trinidad and Tobago, whose calypso style is an especially potent part of the music of the other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the Big Drum dance. The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular &quot;zouk&quot; style and have also had extensive musical contact with the music of Haiti, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The Dutch colonies of Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba share the combined rhythm popular style. The islands also share a passion for kaseko, a genre of Surinamese music; Suriname and its neighbors Guyana and French Guiana share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music.

==Characteristics==
While Lesser Antillean music is very often discussed as a music area, this division is of limited usefulness. The islands of the Lesser Antilles divide musically along linguistic lines, with the most significant overlap coming from Dominica and Saint Lucia, both primarily Anglophone but strongly influenced by a French colonial past. Because the islands are divided linguistically, the term &quot;Antillean music&quot; is usually used in reference to one such music area. Thus, for example, the &quot;Rough Guide to World Music&quot; features a chapter on &quot;Antillean music&quot;, which is entirely about the French Antillean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, with a brief sidebar specifically about the Dutch Antilles.

In the context of Anglophone music, the term &quot;Antillean music&quot; most commonly refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title &quot;Music of the Lesser Antilles&quot; for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.

Nevertheless, Antillean music can be characterized by the prominence of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), and the importance of calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn&#x27;s Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.

===Calypso and calypso-like traditions===

Calypso is most closely associated with the island of Trinidad, but it has spread throughout the Lesser Antilles, and abroad. Similar traditions can be found natively on many of Caribbean islands. Within the Antilles, most of the popular calypso stars have come from Trinidad and Tobago; the majority of the exceptions, such as Arrow from Montserrat, have come from other Anglophone islands. Music author Peter Manuel has argued that, despite the modern Anglophone focus to calypso-like song forms, their origins lie in the &quot;Afro-French creole culture&quot;, and notes that the ancestor of the word &quot;calypso&quot;, &quot;cariso&quot;, was first used to refer to a Martinican singer.

The calypso song complex is characterized by satirical, political, risque and humorous lyricism, a competitive and celebratory nature and its function in social organization and informal communication. Jamaican &quot;mento&quot; is perhaps the best-known form of calypso-like music. The island of Carriacou is home to a calypso-like song style, as well as canboulay feasts, calinda songs, and steel bands, all similar to the related Trinidadian traditions, though distinct from them. Modern influences from Trinidad have organized the Carriacou song style, and there are competitions similar to calypso tents on the island. The Antiguan benna is part of the same song complex, featuring news-oriented and ribald, often satirical lyrics and a rhythmic, uptempo style.

===Carnival===

Annual Carnival celebrations are an important part of the culture of all the Lesser Antillean islands. Carnival is celebrated at varying times of year, either pre-Lent, Christmastime or in July and August, and feature a wide variety of dances, songs and parades. Contests are common, especially Calypso King and Queen contests, which are held on most of the British Antillean islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as French Saint Martin and elsewhere. The British Antillean Carnivals are also mostly united by the J&#x27;ouvert tradition, which involves calypso and soca band parades and are the highlight of their celebrations.

Summer Carnivals include those on Antigua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Eustatius, Saint John, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Saba, Nevis and Anguilla, the latter two of which are especially known for popular calypso competitions. Christmastime Carnivals are held on Montserrat, Saint Croix, Saint Martin and Saint Kitts; Montserrat&#x27;s distinctive Carnival includes masquerades and steelbands, and both islands also feature calypso competitions. The Carnival of Sint Maarten, which takes place a month after Easter, is known for the burning of King Moui-Moui as the culmination of the festival. Many islands, especially the French and Dutch Antilles, are home to pre-Lenten Carnivals, including Martinique, Aruba, Saint-Barthélemy, Bonaire, Curaçao, Dominica, Saint Thomas and Guadeloupe.

==British Antilles==
There are many popular traditions common to the English-speaking islands of the Lesser Antilles. Calypso, originally an old folk music–based genre from West Africa, is popular throughout the islands; other popular traditions, like soca originally from Trinidad, are also well known throughout the region. Steel drum ensembles is also found throughout the English-speaking Lesser Antilles (and abroad), especially in Trinidad and Tobago as well as Antigua and Barbuda. The British Antilles also share in certain folk traditions. Eastern Caribbean folk calypso is found throughout the area, as are African-Caribbean religious music styles like the Shango music of Trinidad. Variants of the Big Drum festival occur throughout the Windward Islands, especially in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Carnival is an important folk music celebration on all the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and the rest of the Caribbean.

Calypso is part of a spectrum of similar folk and popular Caribbean styles that spans benna and mento, but remains the most prominent genre of Lesser Antillean music. Calypso&#x27;s roots are somewhat unclear, but we know it can be traced to 18th-century Trinidad and other Caribbean islands like Saint Lucia. Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the masquerade song &quot;lavway&quot;, French Creole &quot;belair&quot; and the stick fighting chantwell. Calypso&#x27;s early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves, including camboulay drumming and the music masquerade processions. Popular calypso arose in the early 20th century, with the rise of internationally known calypsonians like Attila the Hun and Roaring Lion. calypso remained popular throughout the Caribbean in the later 20th century, the islands began producing calypso stars. In the 1970s, a calypso variant called soca arose, characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism. Soca has since spread across the Caribbean and abroad.

Steel drums are a distinctively Trinidadian ensemble that evolved from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, bamboo tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by pieces of metal used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums, and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched part of the culture of Trinidad and Tobago.

Though Trinidadian popular music is by far the most well-known style of Lesser Antillean music, the other Anglophone islands are home to their own musical traditions. Carriacou and Grenada are home to Carnival celebrations that feature distinct form of calypso, canboulay feasts, calinda stick-fighting songs and the steelband accompanied jouvert, as well as the Big Drum dance, which is also found in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines share other musics as well including the funereal music of the saraca rite, a call-and-response form with both European and African lyrics.

==French Antilles==

French Creole music is most famously associated with Martinique and Guadeloupe, though the islands of Saint Lucia and Dominica are also home to French Antillean music. Creole music is characterized by the prominence of the quadrille dance, distinct from the French version and related to the Haitian &quot;mereng&quot;. The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture.

Martinique and Guadeloupe are also home to their own distinct folk traditions, most influentially including Guadeloupan &quot;gwo ka&quot; and Martinican &quot;tambour&quot; and &quot;tibwa&quot;. &quot;Gwo ka&quot; is a type of percussion music which consists of seven basic rhythms and variations on them. It has been modernized into &quot;gwo ka moderne&quot;, though traditional rural performances (&quot;lewoz&quot;) are still common. Tambour and ti bwa ensembles are the origin of several important Martinican popular styles, including &quot;chouval bwa&quot; and &quot;biguine&quot;, and also exerted an influence on zouk. Lucian folk music features ensembles of fiddle, cuatro, banjo, guitar and chak-chak (a rattle), with the banjo and cuatro being of iconic importance, and recreational, often lyric song forms called &quot;jwé&quot;. The French Creole folk music of Dominica is based on the quadrille, accompanied by ensembles called &quot;jing ping&quot;. Folk storytelling (&quot;kont&quot;) and songs (&quot;bélé&quot;) are also a major part of the country&#x27;s musical identity.

===Cadence-lypso===

Cadence-lypso is the Dominican kadans of the 1970s. The leading figure in the promotion of the Cadence-lypso was the Dominican group Exile One (based on the island of Guadeloupe) and Grammacks that featured the Haitian Cadence rampa or compas with the Trinidadian calypso, hence the name cadence-lypso; however, most of the bands repertoire was kadans.

This fusion of kadans and calypso accounts only for a small percentage of the band&#x27;s repertoire: Exile One like all Dominica kadans bands featured reggae, calypso and mostly kadans or compas music.

The Dominican kadans has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean/Latin rhythms, as well as rock guitars, soul-style vocals and funk bass and horn styles - music from the United States. By the end of the 1970s, Gordon Henderson defined Cadence-lypso as &quot;a synthesis of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary&quot;. It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim.
Exile One, based in Guadeloupe, is a leading Dominican kadans group of the 1970s that was very influential in the development of caribbean music. The full-horn section kadans band Exile One led by Gordon Henderson was the first to introduce the newly arrived synthesizers to their music that other young cadence or compas bands from Dominica, Haiti (mini-jazz) and the French Antilles emulated in the 1970s.

===Zouk===

The inspiration for Zouk&#x27;s style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas, as well as music called cadence-lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. Elements of gwo ka, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vidé are prominent in zouk. Though there are many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk emphasises star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and performances consist almost entirely of studio recordings.

Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault believes zouk&#x27;s evolution was influenced by other Caribbean styles especially Dominica cadence-lypso, Haitian cadence and Guadeloupean &quot;biguine&quot;. Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of antillean music, as well as importing other genres.

The band Kassav&#x27; remain the best known zouk group. Kassav&#x27; drew in influences from balakadri and bal granmoun dances, biguine&#x27;s and mazurka&#x27;s, along with more contemporary Caribbean influences like compas, reggae and salsa music. Zouk live shows soon began to draw on American and European rock and heavy metal traditions, and the genre spread across the world, primarily in developing countries.

Zouk has diversified into multiple subgenres. These include zouk-love, pop ballads by artists like Edith Lefel and Gilles Floro, Zouk-R&amp;B, and ragga-zouk bands like Lord Kossity who fused the genre with other influences.

===Zouk-love===
Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or compas, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems.

The music kizomba from Angola and cabo-love from Cape Verde are also derivatives of this French Antillean compas music style, which sounds basically the same, although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa.
Popular artists include French West Indian artists Edith Lefel and Nichols, or like Netherlands based Suzanna Lubrano and Gil Semedo, the African artist Kaysha.

===Bouyon===

Bouyon (Boo-Yon) is a form of popular music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who originated the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation.

Due to the popularity of Triple K International, Ncore, and the New generation of bouyon bands who toured the French Antilles, a popular offshoot of bouyon from Guadeloupe is called bouyon gwada.
The jump up had its heyday from the 90s with songs such as Met Veye WCK, but remained stamped background music or carnival. Over the years, thanks to inter-trade with the Dominicans and the mass participation of Guadeloupe at the World Creole Music Festival, the flagship group as Triple kay and MFR band began to democratize and local artists were inducted including the remix Allo Triple kay with Daly and &quot;Big Ting Poppin &#x27;Daly alone.

A popular offshoot within the bouyon gwada is called bouyon hardcore, a style characterized by its lewd and violent lyrics. Popular Bouyon gwada musicians include, Wee Low, Suppa, Doc J, Yellow gaza, etc.

===Popular folk music===
Though zouk is the most well-known form of modern French Antillean music, the island of Martinique has also produced the &quot;chouval bwa&quot; and &quot;biguine&quot; styles, which were especially popular in the early 20th century. Chouval bwa is includes multiple distinctive instruments and internationally famous performers like Claude Germany, Dede Saint-Prix, Pakatak and Tumpak, while biguine has achieved international fame since the 1920s and has since been modernized and adapted for pop audiences, making it a major influence on zouk. Between the 1930s and 1950s, the dance &quot;biguine&quot; was popular among the islands&#x27; dance orchestras. The &quot;biguine&quot; uses a &quot;cinquillo&quot; variant related to that found in other Caribbean genres like &quot;méringue&quot; and &quot;Compas&quot;. In the 1940s and 1950s, these dance bands absorbed influences from Cuban, American and Haitian popular music.

==Dutch Antilles==

The islands of Curaçao, Bonaire, Aruba, Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin share musical styles, as well as maintain their own sets of folk and popular dances, ranging from the impromptu Statian road block to calypso, zouk and soca. African, indigenous and European ancestry predominate, though more recent immigrants have brought musical styles from Lebanon, China and India. In popular music, the islands are known for the Combined Rhythm, like local favorites the Happy Peanuts and Expresando Rimto i Ambiente. Kaseko music from the mainland country Suriname is also popular. Traditional music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, however, is primarily African, characterized by the use of complex, highly developed polyrhythms, dance styles and drums like the &quot;tambú&quot;. Other African-derived instruments include metal percussion rods, &quot;agan&quot;, the rasp &quot;wiri&quot;, aerophones like the &quot;cachu&quot; trumpet, &quot;becu&quot; transverse double-reed wind instrument, and the bow &quot;benta&quot;.

The &quot;tambu&quot; is an instrument, and a form of music and dance found on Aruba, Bonaire (where it is sometimes known as &quot;bari&quot;), and Curaçao. The &quot;tambu&quot; is an especially important symbol of Curaçaoan identity. Instrumentation for the &quot;tambu&quot; uses the &quot;agan&quot;, &quot;chapi&quot;, triangle, &quot;wiri&quot; and other instruments, many of which are also part of the African-derived &quot;muziek di zumbi&quot;, or &quot;spirit music&quot;, of Curaçao. Curaçao&#x27;s folk music also includes a rich tradition of work songs with apentatonic lyrics sung in Guene or a Papiamento variant called &quot;seshi&quot;. The Simadan harvest festival is found across the islands, and features the &quot;cachu&quot; trumpet, made from a cowhorn. Bonaire&#x27;s Simadan festival is also notable for the use of the &quot;becu&quot;, an aerophone made from the stalk of a sorghum plant, and the &quot;kinkon&quot;, made from a conch shell and known elsewhere as the &quot;carco&quot;. Folk song forms range from the harvest &quot;seu&quot;, &quot;simadan&quot; and &quot;wapa&quot;. Other songs were imported beginning in the 19th century, including the South American &quot;joropo&quot; and &quot;pasillo&quot;, Spanish Caribbean &quot;merengue&quot; and other new songs, dances and instruments. This diverse mixture was the origin of the Dutch Antilles&#x27; most distinctive and long-standing popular tradition, the &quot;tumba&quot;.

The smaller islands of Saint Martin, Saba and Sint Eustatius largely share in the same folk instruments, dances and songs as their neighbors; however, these islands remain largely unstudied. Saba is home to a vital percussive music tradition, most closely associated with private parties, using instrumentation similar to Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba. Saint Martin is home to a national dance form called the &quot;ponum&quot;, which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid-20th century. Saint Martin is also home to a calypso-like &quot;quimbe&quot; song form, that remains a major part of the island&#x27;s culture.

==Indo-Antillean==

Indo-Caribbean people in the Lesser Antillean music area are clustered in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Indo-Caribbean folk traditions include the &quot;chowtal&quot; songs from the springtime festival &quot;phagwa&quot;, and Hindi &quot;bhajans&quot; which are still sung at temples despite there being few people who understand Hindi. Guyanese and Trinidadian Indo-Caribbeans developed a tradition that fused elements of calypso with the folk music of North India, a style that was referred to as &quot;local music&quot;.

Indo-Caribbean music plays a vital role in various annual festivals like the springtime phagwa, where chowtal is traditionally performed competitively and in teams. Indo-Caribbean Shia Muslims celebrate &quot;Hosay&quot; (Muharram) with floats accompanied by barrel drums called tassa. Wedding music is another important part of Indo-Caribbean music, and is dominated by tan singing. Tan singing is accompanied by the &quot;dholak&quot; drum and &quot;dhantal&quot;, and sometimes includes verbal duels influenced by picong. Indo-Caribbean popular music gained international attention in the late 1980s, with the rise of chutney music. Chutney is a dance music, in its modern form accompanied by soca instrumentation, such as synthesizers and pressure drums. This style is called chutney-soca.

<text>The Last Hero is a short fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the twenty-seventh book in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. It was published in 2001 in a larger format than the other &quot;Discworld&quot; novels and illustrated on every page by Paul Kidby.

==Plot summary==
A message arrives for Lord Vetinari from the Agatean Empire, explaining that the Silver Horde (a group of aged barbarians introduced in &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, and led by Cohen the Barbarian) have set out on a quest. The first hero of the Discworld, &quot;Fingers&quot; Mazda, stole fire from the gods and gave it to mankind (analogous to Prometheus), and was chained to a rock to be torn open daily by a giant eagle as punishment. Disillusioned with how their lives have turned out, the Silver Horde seek to return fire to the gods with interest, in the form of a large sled packed with explosive Agatean Thunder Clay. They plan to blow up the gods at their mountain home, Cori Celesti. They have kidnapped a bard so that he can write the saga of their quest. Along the way, they are joined by Evil Harry Dread (the last Dark Lord) and Vena the Raven-haired (an elderly heroine who has now gone grey).

The Wizards of Unseen University explain to Lord Vetinari that blowing up Cori Celesti will destroy the Discworld by temporarily disrupting the Disc&#x27;s magical field (the only thing holding the Disc together), so Vetinari organises an effort to stop the Horde. Since the Horde is already near the centre of the Discworld and the home of the gods, speed is of the essence. Vetinari recruits Leonard of Quirm, who designs the Discworld&#x27;s second known spacecraft to slingshot under the Discworld and back around the top, landing on Cori Celesti.

The vessel, named the &quot;Kite&quot; by Leonard, can carry only three people. Leonard of Quirm, Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson, and Rincewind volunteer for the mission (although Rincewind volunteers reluctantly, believing that he would have wound up going on the mission in any case, either by being forced to go or whilst trying to run away). The Librarian accidentally stows away, having fallen asleep behind some crates of equipment while loading the &quot;Kite&quot;. After a few mishaps, including landing on the moon (to replenish their oxygen supply) and nearly having their swamp dragon powered spaceship explode on them, they crash in a spectacular fashion into the main gate of Cori Celesti.

Meanwhile, the Horde have already reached Cori Celesti. The gods allow them to sneak in disguised as gods themselves, despite (or perhaps because of) their having been betrayed to the gods by Evil Harry. The Horde suspect that the gods have been manipulating their entire quest. Fate challenges Cohen to roll a 7 on a standard 6-sided die. Cohen cheats Fate by slicing the die in half in mid-air with his sword; the two halves land with the 6 and 1 both facing up. Cohen also notes that even if he does not succeed in killing the gods, someone will have tried, so someone will eventually try harder.

Captain Carrot attempts to arrest the Horde, at which point the Horde arms the explosives. While initially intending to attack him, the Horde realise that as a single brave man outnumbered by his foes and trying to save the world, Carrot is a Hero (and probably a king in disguise), and so their defeat is certain. After Rincewind explains that the detonation will destroy the entire Discworld, the Horde grab the explosives and throw them (and themselves) off the mountain.

As punishment for creating the &quot;Kite&quot; and for not expressing belief in the gods, Leonard is ordered by the gods to paint the entire ceiling of the Temple of Small Gods with a spectacular mural of the whole world (despite Blind Io saying he would be satisfied with &quot;a nice duck-egg blue with a few stars&quot;). They impose a time limit of 10 years on the task (Leonard finishes the task in a few weeks). Carrot asks for a to allow for the repairs of the &quot;Kite&quot; so that they can return to Ankh-Morpork. Rincewind asks for a blue balloon and the Librarian asks for some library supplies (and a red balloon).

The Horde&#x27;s end is ambiguous. Valkyries come to take the heroes to the Halls of the Slain, where a feast has been prepared for them. Instead, the Silver Horde, refusing to accept their deaths, steal the valkyries&#x27; horses and set off to find other worlds to &quot;do heroic stuff in&quot; Death does not appear to them, as he often does when Discworld characters die, although he subsequently appears to Vena, and is evasive about whether he is &quot;collecting&quot;.

After the Horde leave with the Valkyries&#x27; horses, their first stop is to visit Mazda where he is being punished, cut off his chains, give him something to drink, and leave him a sword so that he may deal with his punisher. The bard, changed by his experience, composes a new style of saga, one with musical accompaniment, about it.

<text>The Church of St Benet Paul&#x27;s Wharf is a Welsh Anglican church in the City of London, England. Since 1556, it has also been the official church of the College of Arms in which many officers of arms have been buried. In 1666 it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London, after which it was rebuilt and merged with nearby St Peter&#x27;s. The current church was designed by Sir Christopher Wren. It is one of only four churches in the City of London to escape damage during World War II.

==History==
St Benet&#x27;s traces its history back to the year 1111, when a church was built on the site and dedicated to St Benedict. Over time the name became St. Benet&#x27;s Paul&#x27;s Wharf after the hythe where the church was located. To the west of the site was the watergate of Baynard&#x27;s Castle, which is referenced in the biographies of Queen Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey. Both the church and the castle were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was redesigned by the architect Christopher Wren, and reopened in 1683. The builder was Edward Strong the Elder.

On 2 March 1706, Henrietta Hobart married Charles Howard, 9th Earl of Suffolk, a captain in the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons there. (Henrietta Howard subsequently became mistress to the future King George II.)

The church was narrowly saved from destruction in the late 19th century, when its parish was merged with that of St Nicholas Cole Abbey. After an energetic campaign by its supporters, Queen Victoria in 1879 granted the church to Welsh Anglicans for services. St Benet&#x27;s continues as London&#x27;s Metropolitan Welsh church, with its services conducted in the Welsh language, and with English translation provided.

===Present day===
In 2008 the church was closed for a few months due to a &quot;dwindling congregation&quot; but reopened in time for the carol service in December that year. Services are held weekly on Sunday mornings at 11am, with occasional special services on Sunday afternoons at 3pm. The church can be toured on Thursdays between 11am and 3pm.

The parish is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women and/or female leadership.

==Exterior==
The church is of dark red brick, with alternating courses of Portland stone at the corners. The tower is situated to the north-west of the nave and is capped by a small lead dome, lantern and simple short spire.

==Interior==

The interior is almost a square. Unusually for a Wren church, the ceiling is flat rather than domed or barrel-vaulted. The north gallery was formerly used by the Doctors&#x27; Commons, and is now used by the College of Arms. Most of the original 17th-century furnishings are still intact, including the magnificent altar table, reredos and pulpit, designed by Grinling Gibbons. The lectern and baptismal font are also original.

The galleries are supported by Corinthian columns. There is a memorial to Inigo Jones, who was buried in the previous church, and a medallion bust of Sir Robert Wyseman, a benefactor of St Benet&#x27;s who died in 1684.

==Officers of arms buried in the church==
*Hon. Sir George Rothe Bellew, Garter
*Sir Ralph Bigland, Garter
*Sir Anthony Richard Wagner, Garter
*Sir Gilbert Dethick, Garter
*Sir Henry St George, Garter
*John Riddell Bromhead Walker, Clarenceux
*George Drewry Squibb, Norfolk
*Rodney Onslow Dennys, Somerset
*Major Francis Jones, Wales
*John Philipot, Somerset
*John Charles Brooke, Somerset
*Sir William Cheney, Kent

<text>Clayton Holmes Aiken (&quot;né&quot; Grissom; born November 30, 1978) is an American singer, television personality, actor and political activist. Aiken finished second place on the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2003, and his debut album, &quot;Measure of a Man&quot;, went multi-platinum. He released four more albums on the RCA label, &quot;Merry Christmas with Love&quot; (2004), &quot;A Thousand Different Ways&quot; (2006), the Christmas EP &quot;All is Well&quot; (2006), and &quot;On My Way Here&quot; (2008). Since then he has released two more albums, both with Decca Records: &quot;Tried and True&quot; (2010) and &quot;Steadfast&quot; (2012). Aiken has also had eleven tours in support of his albums. In all, he has sold over 5 million albums, and is the fourth-highest-selling &quot;American Idol&quot; alumnus.

Aiken co-wrote a bestselling memoir in 2004, &quot;Learning to Sing&quot;. In 2004, he also had a televised Christmas special, &quot;A Clay Aiken Christmas&quot;. During much of 2008 he appeared on Broadway in the musical comedy &quot;Spamalot&quot;, in the role of Sir Robin. In 2010 he hosted the PBS special &quot;Tried &amp; True Live!&quot; He has also had numerous cameo and guest appearances on TV shows. In 2012 he competed in the fifth season of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, coming in second to Arsenio Hall.

With Diane Bubel, Aiken created the Bubel/Aiken Foundation in 2003, which was later renamed the National Inclusion Project. In 2004, he became a UNICEF ambassador, a position he held until 2013 when he gave it up to run for Congress. He traveled extensively in this role. In 2006, he was appointed for a two-year term to the Presidential Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities.

In 2014, Aiken ran for the United States House of Representatives in North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. Initially considered a novelty candidate, Aiken won the Democratic primary, but lost to Republican incumbent Renee Ellmers in the general election. In January 2022, he announced a run for the Democratic nomination in North Carolina&#x27;s 4th congressional district, but he lost in the primary to Valerie Foushee.

==Early life==
Clay Aiken was born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. As a young boy, Aiken sang in the Raleigh Boychoir; and, as a teenager, he sang in school choirs, church choir, musicals and local theatre productions. After high school, he sang lead with a local band, Just By Chance, co-hosting and performing with the band at &quot;Just by Chance and Friends&quot; shows in Dunn, North Carolina. He was also MC and performer at the Johnston Community College Country Showcase in Smithfield and at the North Carolina Music Connection and Hometown Music Connection shows in Garner, and Benson. He performed the national anthem numerous times for the Raleigh IceCaps and the Carolina Hurricanes hockey teams, and performed it at the 2011 NHL All-Star Game at the RBC Center in Raleigh. Three demo albums of Aiken&#x27;s vocals were created before &quot;American Idol&quot; with the aid of studio time given as a birthday gift by his mother: a cassette called &quot;Look What Love Has Done&quot; (by Clayton Grissom), a cassette and CD entitled &quot;Redefined&quot; (by Clayton Aiken), and a CD that combined some songs from each of the previous demos:&quot; &quot;Look What Love Has Done, Vol 2&quot;&quot; (by Clay Aiken). Estranged from his abusive birth father Vernon Grissom and with his mother&#x27;s and grandfather Alvis Aiken&#x27;s permission, at the age of 19 he legally changed his surname from Grissom to his mother Faye&#x27;s maiden name, Aiken.

Aiken attended Raleigh&#x27;s Leesville Road High School and took courses at Campbell University before enrolling at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. In 1995, Aiken started working at the YMCA. Still in high school, Aiken learned quickly that he could make a difference in the lives of young people. He found his interest in special education while directing YMCA children&#x27;s camps as a teenager, and at age 19, he served as a substitute teacher for a classroom of autistic students at Brentwood Elementary School in Raleigh. It was during that experience that he decided to finish college and become a special education teacher. While attending college in Charlotte, he took a part-time job as an assistant to a boy with autism, and it was this child&#x27;s mother, Diane Bubel, who urged him to audition for &quot;American Idol&quot;. Although his &quot;American Idol&quot; activities temporarily delayed his academic pursuits, Aiken completed his course work while on tour and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in special education in December 2003.

==&quot;American Idol&quot;==

Aiken had filled out an application to participate in the reality show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; when a friend of his insisted that he try out for &quot;American Idol&quot; instead. Television viewers first glimpsed Aiken during the audition episodes at the beginning of &quot;American Idol&#x27;s&quot; second season. The show&#x27;s judges first saw Aiken as a nerdy type unlikely to be a typical pop idol, but after hearing him sing Heatwave&#x27;s &quot;Always and Forever&quot; decided to advance him to the next round. The clip of the judges&#x27; surprise during this audition performance was replayed many times over the course of the competition.

Aiken made it to the round of 32 before being cut from the show, but he was invited to return for the &quot;Wild Card&quot; round; his performance of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; sent him on to the final 12 as the viewer&#x27;s choice. While noted for his performance of ballads, such as Neil Sedaka&#x27;s &quot;Solitaire&quot;, his upbeat performances, including the Foundations&#x27; &quot;Build Me Up Buttercup&quot;, were also appreciated. Aiken received enough votes every week to keep him out of the bottom three. Part of his appeal was his &quot;geek to chic&quot; transformation in appearance. &quot;I looked like Opie&quot;, Aiken said to &quot;People&quot; magazine regarding his appearance at his &quot;American Idol&quot; audition in 2002. He replaced his glasses with contact lenses and agreed to let the show&#x27;s stylists change his hair style. With longer, flat ironed, spiky hair and a penchant for wearing striped shirts, Aiken had established a trademark look by the final &quot;American Idol&quot; season 2 show.

On May 21, 2003, Aiken came in a close second to Ruben Studdard, who won the contest by 134,000 votes out of more than 24,000,000 votes cast. The result was controversial, as some hypothesized that &quot;Idol&quot; voting system was incapable of handling the number of attempted calls. In an interview prior to the start of the fifth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, Executive Producer Nigel Lythgoe revealed for the first time that Aiken had led the fan voting every week from the Wild Card week to the finale, when the possibly-random voting result gave Studdard the win.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; featured Aiken on the cover of its July 2003 issue. In the cover article, Aiken said, &quot;One thing I&#x27;ve found of people in the public eye, either you&#x27;re a womanizer or you&#x27;ve got to be gay. Since I&#x27;m neither one of those, people are completely concerned about me.&quot; In subsequent interviews he expressed frustration over continued questions about his sexual orientation, telling &quot;People&quot; magazine in 2006, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what I say. People are going to believe what they want.&quot;

Aiken made a surprise appearance on the final show of the fifth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, when failed auditioner Michael Sandecki returned to the show to receive a &quot;Golden Idol&quot; award for Best Impersonator for his Clay Aiken-like appearance. Aiken appeared without introduction in a well-tailored designer suit and longer, darker hair with bangs, looking so different that many did not recognize him until he began to sing &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;.
The second season of the &quot;American Idol Rewind&quot; series (2007) was narrated by Aiken.

Aiken is reportedly one of the top 10 earners of &quot;Idol&quot;, earning an estimated $1.5 million in 2010.

==Music==

===2003–2004: &quot;Measure of a Man&quot;===
On October 14, 2003, Aiken released his first solo album, &quot;Measure of a Man&quot;, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with 613,000 copies sold in its first week, the highest-selling debut for a solo artist in 10 years. The album received RIAA Double Platinum certification on November 17, 2003 (a Double Platinum plaque was presented to Aiken by Clive Davis on October 22, 2003, during &quot;Good Morning America&quot;). The album spawned both the hit single &quot;Invisible&quot; and his first hit song, &quot;This Is the Night&quot; (both co-written by British songwriter Chris Braide). Later that year, Aiken won the Fan&#x27;s Choice Award at the American Music Awards ceremony, and his CD single &quot;This Is The Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; won the Billboard award for the Best-Selling Single of 2003.

===2004–2006: &quot;Merry Christmas With Love&quot;===
On November 16, 2004, Aiken released a holiday album titled &quot;Merry Christmas with Love&quot;, which set a new record for fastest-selling holiday album in the Soundscan era (since 1991). The album debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and tied Céline Dion&#x27;s record for the highest debut by a holiday album in the history of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. &quot;Merry Christmas with Love&quot; sold over 1,000,000 copies retail in six weeks and was the best-selling holiday album of 2004, receiving RIAA Platinum certification on January 6, 2005.

===2006–2008: &quot;A Thousand Different Ways&quot; And &quot;All Is Well&quot;===
Aiken&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;A Thousand Different Ways&quot;, was released September 19, 2006. He worked on the album under the guidance of Canadian producer and A&amp;R executive Jaymes Foster. The album contains ten cover songs and four new songs, one of which Aiken co-wrote. Clive Davis is credited with the cover concept. with the album on iTunes. Debuting at number two on the Billboard chart, &quot;A Thousand Different Ways&quot; made Aiken the fourth artist ever to have his first three albums debut in the Top 5 and scan over 200,000 in the first week.

Aiken&#x27;s second Christmas album, &quot;All Is Well&quot; (an EP of four Christmas songs), was released exclusively to Walmart on November 28, 2006, and was released to iTunes as a digital download in December 2007.

===2008–2009: &quot;On My Way Here&quot;===
Aiken stated in an April 2007 interview with &quot;People&quot; that he was planning a new album, and during his May 2007 appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, he mentioned that he was in Los Angeles interviewing producers for the new album. Aiken found a song, &quot;On My Way Here&quot;, written by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, that struck a chord with him and became the inspiration for the album&#x27;s theme in addition to the album title. For a cohesive sound, Aiken chose Mark &#x27;Kipper&#x27; Eldridge to produce the entire album. &quot;On My Way Here&quot; was released May 6, 2008, on the RCA label.

According to an article posted on &quot;Billboard&quot;, Aiken and RCA parted ways shortly after his &quot;On My Way Here&quot; album was released.
Aiken&#x27;s rep confirmed to &quot;People&quot; magazine that Aiken left RCA. Stated in the cited &quot;People&quot; article, &quot;The buzz about Aiken&#x27;s exit was fueled earlier this week when his picture disappeared online and Billboard, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Aiken, 30, had been dropped by the label. According to Billboard, Aiken&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;On My Way Here&quot; sold just 159,000 copies in the U.S., compared to his 2003 debut album, &quot;Measure of a Man&quot;, which sold 2.78 million copies&quot;.

A fifth album, &quot;&quot;, was released at the end of March 2009 on Sony&#x27;s Legacy Recordings Playlist Series. This album was a compilation of songs that had been included on the previous albums released by RCA. First week sales of 3000 copies placed &quot;Playlist: The Very Best of Clay Aiken&quot; at number 173 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and at number ten on the Top Internet Albums chart.

===2009–2011: &quot;Tried and True&quot;===
On August 10, 2009, it was announced on Aiken&#x27;s official website that he had signed with Decca Records and he would have new music out by early 2010. Performing the songs from his new album, &quot;Tried and True&quot;, Aiken held a one night only concert at the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium in Raleigh, North Carolina on March 12, 2010. The concert, filmed for PBS broadcast, included guest appearances by Ruben Studdard and Linda Eder. Eder joined Aiken on stage for their duet of &quot;Crying&quot;, which they recorded for his album. The album was released on June 1, 2010, and features songs popular in the 1950s and 1960s, including two Aiken covered during his run on &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; and &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;. In conjunction with the PBS special a companion DVD, &quot;Tried &amp; True Live!&quot;, was released on July 27, 2010. A tour to promote the album is planned for early 2014.

===2011–present: &quot;Steadfast&quot;===
On December 20, 2011, Aiken released a new single, &quot;Bring Back My Love&quot; under the Decca Label. The single is his first original song since the release of his album &quot;On My Way Here&quot; in 2008. On March 27, 2012, Aiken released &quot;Steadfast&quot;, a new album of previous recordings and songs only sung in concerts. The album debuted at number 120 on the Billboard 200 chart with sales of 4,000 in the first week.

==Television==
Aiken has made many television appearances.

On Labor Day 2003, Aiken sang &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; at the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot; and received a standing ovation from the audience. Lewis compared Aiken with Frank Sinatra and marveled at the dedication of Aiken&#x27;s fan base:

That same year, Aiken sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; on the opening night of the 2003 World Series and appeared in numerous television specials during the winter of 2003, including &quot;Disney&#x27;s Christmas Day Parade&quot; and the &quot;Nick at Nite Holiday Special&quot;, where he sang the &quot;Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth&quot; with Bing Crosby via special effects.

Aiken starred in and executive produced his first TV special (December 2004), titled &quot;A Clay Aiken Christmas&quot;, with special guests Barry Manilow, Yolanda Adams, and Megan Mullally; the special was released on DVD later that month. On July 4, 2004, Aiken was one of the performers in the &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot; concert in Washington, D.C. and performed in the &quot;Good Morning America&quot; Summer Concert Series in 2004 and 2005. He also sang &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Lovely&quot; on the popular television show &quot;Scrubs&quot;.

Aiken was the musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2004 and participated in several skits. He has appeared multiple times on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, interviewing with Jay Leno as a guest in addition to singing, and has become a regular guest on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. The Kimmel appearances often feature skits: in one, Jimmy Kimmel&#x27;s then girlfriend Sarah Silverman confessed to an affair with Aiken, and in another, Aiken expressed his distaste for Kimmel&#x27;s jokes about him by beating him up. In May 2007, he spent the first half of his interview on horseback while talking about his recent UNICEF trip to Afghanistan. A few weeks later he appeared as a spokesperson for &quot;Guillermo&#x27;s Mustache&quot; in Kimmel&#x27;s fictional DVD informercial shown on the &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; finale. Aiken made his acting debut on &quot;Ed&quot; in early 2004, playing himself, and in 2005, he was interviewed by Erica Kane on &quot;All My Children&quot;. He played the role of cafeteria worker Kenny on the &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode &quot;My Life in Four Cameras&quot;. In December 2006, he made an appearance as himself on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

After hosting and performing in the &quot;American Idol&quot; Christmas special in 2003, Aiken has had several subsequent hosting jobs. He was a special correspondent for &quot;The Insider&quot; for the 2005 Emmy Awards, and on the sets of the sitcom &quot;Reba&quot; with Reba McEntire and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He co-hosted &quot;The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet&quot; in 2006, and on November 17, 2006, filled in for Regis Philbin as guest host on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;. During an interview, Aiken covered Kelly Ripa&#x27;s mouth with his hand. The incident drew considerable media reaction after Ripa complained at length about the incident on her show the following Monday. Aiken made fun of the controversy on the &quot;2006 American Music Awards&quot; the next night with Tori Spelling. On &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot; in 2006, filmed before the Ripa incident, Aiken mentioned wanting to have his own talk show someday, and Banks switched seats with him and let him interview her for one segment of the show. Aiken was a guest judge on the April 8, 2009, segment of Banks show &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;; in what the show refers to as a teach, he worked with the remaining eight contestants on their acting skills prior to the judging.

In November 2007, Aiken was a contestant on a celebrity edition of the game show &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&quot;. Playing for his charity, the National Inclusion Project, he chose to drop out after the ninth question with US$300,000, despite having a copy and a save at his disposal. If he had played the tenth question, he would have won US$500,000; Aiken and the 5th grader playing with him both had the correct answer.

In May 2009, Aiken made a guest appearance on &quot;30 Rock&quot; in the season 3 episode &quot;Kidney Now!&quot;. It was revealed in this episode that he is the cousin of the show&#x27;s character Kenneth.

In August 2010, Aiken guest starred in an episode of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, called &quot;Phineas and Ferb: Summer Belongs to You!&quot;. Aiken sang an inspirational duet with Chaka Khan, to encourage those who did not believe that Phineas and Ferb could accomplish their goal of circling the globe faster than the sun, thus creating the longest summer day of all time.

On January 30, 2011, Aiken sang the United States&#x27; national anthem at the 2011 NHL All-Star game held at the RBC Center in Raleigh, North Carolina, home of the Carolina Hurricanes.

On July 24, 2011, Aiken guest starred on the comedy drama series &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot;.

In 2012, Aiken was the runner-up on the fifth season of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, raising US$361,500 for the National Inclusion Project.

Aiken appeared in one of the last episodes of &quot;The Office&quot;, titled &quot;A.A.R.M.&quot;. He played himself and was one of the judges for a reality show that Andy was auditioning for.

In 2013, Aiken guest starred on an episode &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; along with Taylor Hicks and Ashanti, playing themselves as judges for a singing contest on the episode called &quot;Dissonant Voices&quot;.

In 2024, Aiken paired up with Ruben Studdard when they competed in season eleven of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Beets&quot;. They were eliminated during the Group B finals alongside Corey Feldman as &quot;Seal&quot;.

==Broadway==
On January 18, 2008, Aiken made his Broadway debut when he joined the cast of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Spamalot&quot; for a four-month run, ending on May 4, 2008. He played Sir Robin, in the Tony Award-winning musical directed by Mike Nichols. In addition to Sir Robin, Aiken played the 1st Guard and the Brother Maynard roles. On August 12, 2008, it was announced that Aiken would resume his role as Sir Robin beginning on September 19 and ending on January 4, 2009. On December 23, 2008, Aiken had his caricature unveiled at world-famous Sardi&#x27;s restaurant. In December 2018, Aiken and Ruben Studdard starred in &quot;Ruben &amp; Clay&#x27;s First Annual Family Fun Pageant Spectacular Reunion Christmas Show&quot; on Broadway.

==Other theater work==
In May 2013, Aiken starred as &quot;Man in Chair&quot; in North Carolina Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot;, along with fellow Raleigh native and Tony Award winner Beth Leavel, who reprised her role as &quot;The Chaperone&quot;.

During the summer of 2013, Aiken performed the role of Joseph in the musical &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine. Aiken enjoyed the role because he did not have to dance.

In June 2019, Aiken starred as Teen Angel in &quot;Grease&quot; at the Benedum Center in Pittsburgh. &quot;The energy level is high, but there&#x27;s no question it steps up a notch when Clay Aiken struts out in the second act and gives Pittsburgh a taste of why his Claymates are hopelessly devoted to the former American Idol.&quot; &quot;As &#x27;Teen Angel&#x27; in the Pittsburgh CLO&#x27;s production of &quot;Grease&quot;, Aiken is only on stage for about five minutes. Those five minutes, however, are fab-u-lous.&quot;

==Tours==
From February through April 2004, Aiken and Kelly Clarkson embarked on the Independent Tour as co-headliners. Following this tour, he was scheduled for a few summer solo tour dates, but demand ultimately led to the booking of 50 dates across the United States, resulting in what many fans called the &quot;Not-A-Tour&quot;. Disney (Buena Vista) was the exclusive sponsor of this unnamed summer tour, promoting their &quot;Aladdin&quot; Special Edition 2-Disc DVD with a preview of Aiken&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Proud of Your Boy&quot;, a song originally intended for the first release of the film but cut when the Aladdin storyline changed during production. A music video featuring Aiken is on the &quot;Aladdin&quot; Special Edition DVD. On this tour, he also performed a duet, &quot;Without You&quot;, which was released on Kimberley Locke&#x27;s 2004 debut album &quot;One Love&quot;.

In November 2004, Aiken launched his third tour of the year, which revolved around a Christmas theme. &quot;The Joyful Noise Tour&quot;, sponsored by Ronald McDonald House Charities, featured a conductor and a 30-piece orchestra. In some cities, Aiken was supported by the local philharmonic or symphony, such as the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Local choirs from high schools and elementary schools also participated at each concert.

 During the summer of 2005, Aiken, with a seven-piece band and three back-up singers, toured with the &quot;Jukebox Tour&quot;, performing songs of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, as well as a few favorites from &quot;Measure of a Man&quot;. He also performed a few new songs being considered for his next album.

In early November 2005, Aiken launched his second Christmas tour. The 2005 Joyful Noise tour featured a series of vignettes, written by Aiken, which told the story of an older woman who had lost the Christmas spirit and a young boy who helps her find it again. A cast of actors, dancers and back-up singers traveled with the tour, and members of local theater groups were added in each venue for smaller, non-speaking roles and crowd scenes. The tour opened in Vancouver, British Columbia, on November 2, and ended in Clearwater, Florida on December 30. According to Pollstar, Aiken&#x27;s first five tours grossed $28 million.

In December 2006, Aiken began his third Christmas tour, comprising performances in 18 Midwest and East Coast cities. Aiken was supported by local orchestras, which also opened the concerts with a program of seasonal music.

A 23-date tour in support of his third album, &quot;A Thousand Different Ways&quot;, began on July 4, 2007, and ended in Orlando, Florida, on August 19. On this tour Aiken hired local symphonies to back him, along with tour regulars Jesse Vargas, pianist, conductor and arranger; Sean McDaniel, drummer; and Quiana Parler and Angela Fisher, backup singers. Stops included the Greek Theatre (Los Angeles), Chautauqua Institution in New York, and the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia. Three days into the tour, Aiken and a woman were involved in an in-flight altercation in which she allegedly shoved him. As a result of the scuffle, Aiken and the woman were later questioned by the FBI. Aiken told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that he had been sleeping when the incident occurred.

His fourth annual Christmas tour, &quot;Christmas in the Heartland&quot;, began on November 26, 2007, in Wichita, Kansas. That 21-date tour ended on December 22, 2007, in Merrillville, Indiana.

He has ended all of his Christmas tours with his signature Christmas song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Save It All For Christmas Day&quot;.

Aiken and Ruben Studdard brought their &quot;Timeless&quot; tour to cities in the US and Canada beginning in Asheville, North Carolina, on July 23, 2010, and ending in Biloxi, Mississippi, on August 14. Instead of a concert focusing on each singers recordings, Aiken and Studdard opted for a variety show format covering medleys of songs from the 1960s to the 1990s with a few solos and interspersed with comedy bits.

Aiken announced on July 30, 2010, that he will be touring in February and March 2011 in conjunction with PBS to support his album &quot;Tried and True&quot; and accompanying live DVD &quot;Clay Aiken: Tried and True – Live&quot;.

Aiken began his fifth Christmas tour &quot;Joyful Noise 2012&quot; in Florida in November 2012.

==Activism==
In 1995, Aiken started working at the YMCA.

At 19, Aiken taught at Brentwood Elementary School in a class of kids with autism. It was during that experience that he decided to finish college and become a special education teacher.

Aiken has participated in multiple benefit events and concerts, including the 2004 Rosalynn Carter Benefit, the America&#x27;s Promise Benefit, and Heather Headley&#x27;s Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS benefit, &quot;Home&quot;, where he sang a duet with Headley. He was one of the celebrity readers for the &quot;Arthur Celebrity Audiobook (Stories for Heroes Series)&quot;, which benefits the Bubel/Aiken Foundation (now the National Inclusion Project) and other charities, and served as spokesperson for the series. He was also a spokesperson for the 2004 Toys For Tots drive, and acted as an ambassador for the Ronald McDonald House Charities. Aiken worked with the Make A Wish Foundation to make one little boy&#x27;s dream of singing on stage with Clay Aiken come true.

In September 2006, Aiken was appointed to the Presidential Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities by President George W. Bush. Appointees serve a two-year term; Aiken was sworn on September 14, 2006, by HHS Assistant Secretary for Children and Families Wade F. Horn, PhD

While appearing in Spamalot, Aiken used his free time and celebrity to help raise funds for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS (BC/EFA) during their fund drives and auctions. In 2010, Aiken spoke out for gay rights at the Human Rights Campaign dinner in North Carolina. He also joined other celebrities in filming an educational video for Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s web based Give a Damn campaign, a project of her True Colors Fund. In addition to UNICEF and his National Inclusion Project he is promoting GLSEN, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network as one of his causes on his official website.

===National Inclusion Project (formerly BAF)===

Aiken&#x27;s interest in autism issues led him, along with Diane Bubel (whose son Michael is diagnosed with autism and was tutored by Aiken), to found the National Inclusion Project (formerly the Bubel/Aiken Foundation), which supports the integration of children with disabilities into the life environment of their non-disabled peers. The foundation runs summer camps which reflect its mission, and also presents Able to Serve awards to support the volunteer efforts of children with physical and mental disabilities. In July 2005, Raleigh&#x27;s WRAL-TV reported on an internet campaign mounted by critics questioning how Aiken&#x27;s foundation used its money. WRAL news hired an independent accountant who reported that program services totaled $920,000 in 2004—around 85 cents on every dollar donated—which is considered a solid percentage compared to other charities. CNN picked up the story, and Aiken appeared on &quot;Showbiz Tonight&quot; to provide details about the foundation&#x27;s programs. In late 2004, the foundation was awarded a $500,000 grant by the US government to develop a K–12 model for inclusion in community service projects to be used in schools across the country. In addition, State Farm granted $1.5 million to the foundation to help develop a primary education curriculum focused on teaching social and life skills through service to children of all levels of ability.

On August 5, 2009, in an open letter from the founders, Clay Aiken and Diane Bubel announced that they would rename the organization as the &quot;National Inclusion Project&quot;.

===UNICEF===
In November 2004, Aiken was appointed a U.S. Fund for UNICEF National Ambassador, with a mission to help ensure that children everywhere are afforded a primary education. After the tsunami at the end of 2004, he participated in the NBC4 telethon, which raised over $10 million, and recorded public service announcements in support of South Asian tsunami relief. He later recorded a video, featuring the song &quot;Give A Little Bit&quot;, to be used as a public service announcement to raise money for tsunami victims. He was the 2005 spokesperson for the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF drive.

In March 2005, UNICEF sent Aiken to the tsunami-stricken Banda Aceh area to raise awareness of the need to restore education quickly to the children who survived this disaster. UNICEF sent Aiken on another mission in May 2005, to northern Uganda, to witness the plight of children called &quot;night commuters&quot;, who flee the villages each night to sleep in streets and shelters in hopes of avoiding being kidnapped by the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army. He was sent to Kabul and Bamyan, in Afghanistan in April 2007, where he was able to spend time with children in their classrooms; he also visited a health center for women and children where he administered oral polio vaccinations to babies. He observed that Afghani children, after being forbidden for so many years by the Taliban regime to attend school, are eager to return to school now that they are once again allowed to receive an education. Aiken spent his 2007 Christmas in Mexico with the children affected by the floods in the states of Chiapas and Tabasco. In late June and early July 2008, UNICEF sent Aiken to Somalia and Kenya.

==Politics==
===2014 Congressional election===

In the 2014 midterm elections, Aiken was the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. He won the Democratic primary, held on May 6, 2014, by fewer than 400 votes. His main opponent, Keith Crisco, died days after the primary vote but before the votes could be certified. In the general election, held on November 4, 2014, Aiken was defeated by incumbent Republican Congresswoman Renee Ellmers, 59 to 41 percent. North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd district is considered a safe Republican seat. Aiken&#x27;s campaign was captured by a filmmaking team and shown in the 2015 documentary miniseries &quot;The Runner-Up&quot;, which aired on the Esquire Network.

Since coming out as gay in 2008, Aiken has been more politically outspoken, particularly on gay rights and same-sex marriage. He spoke out against North Carolina Amendment 1, adopted in 2012, which banned gay marriage and civil unions in the state. When he ran for Congress, however, he said he did not want to be perceived as a single-issue candidate and said gay marriage was &quot;not the issue&quot; he was campaigning on. He said he wanted to focus on issues that were more important to people in his district. His assertion earned him a number of critics among supporters of same-sex marriage, including Bill Maher.

Citing his appearance on &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, Aiken defended Donald Trump against accusations of racism during the 2016 presidential race. However, following the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Aiken tweeted an apology for denying Trump was racist, going so far to say, &quot;I&#x27;m a fucking dumbass.&quot; Aiken reiterated that he was a Democrat and did not vote for Trump.

===2022 Congressional election===
In January 2022, Aiken released a video titled &quot;Warming Up&quot;, in which he announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination in North Carolina&#x27;s 4th congressional district. In this video, Aiken is quoted as saying, &quot;If the loudest and most hateful voices think they are going to speak for us, just tell them I&#x27;m warming up the old vocal chords.&quot;

Sara Pequeño, a member of the Raleigh-based &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; editorial board, criticized Aiken for jumping into the race when other Democratic candidates had more political experience and questioned &quot;what has he done to serve North Carolina?&quot;

In the Democratic primary, Aiken was overshadowed by two other Democratic candidates, state Senator Valerie Foushee and Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam and he finished third place in the eight candidate primary.

===Electoral history===

====2014====





====2022====





==Fans==
 Aiken was voted the Favorite Reality Star of 2003 by &quot;TV Guide&quot; readers and &quot;the most-loved reality star of all time&quot; in a &quot;TV Guide&quot; poll conducted in the summer of 2005. In February 2006, &quot;People&quot; magazine readers voted Aiken their &quot;Favorite American Idol&quot;.

While the origin of the term &quot;Claymates&quot; is unknown, Aiken trademarked the term. While in Los Angeles in September 2006 for a CD signing and appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Aiken talked with Jann Carl of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; about the names various sub-groups have given themselves: &quot;Claysians&quot; (Asian fans), &quot;Claynadians&quot; (Canadian fans), &quot;Clayropeans&quot; (European fans) and &quot;Claydawgs&quot; (male fans). She then teased him about having his own &quot;Clay Nation&quot;. At the CD signing, two young fans asked Aiken to autograph their shoulderblades and then went to the local tattoo parlor to make them permanent; later that day on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; they were brought on stage to show the tattoos. Although some of his fans have been criticized at times by the media as being obsessive, he defends the group as a whole. When Kimmel said to Aiken that his fans were &quot;crazy&quot;, Aiken stated that they were merely &quot;enthusiastic&quot;. In 2003, in anticipation of the release of &quot;Measure of a Man&quot;, fans all over the country decided to get together and hold parties to celebrate the release of the CD and purchase copies at midnight. In 2006, for the release of &quot;A Thousand Different Ways&quot;, release parties were held in more than 80 cities in the United States, Canada, and Singapore.

==Personal life==
On August 8, 2008, Aiken announced, on his personal blog, the birth of his son in North Carolina: &quot;My dear friend, Jaymes, and I are so excited to announce the birth of Parker Foster Aiken.&quot; The child&#x27;s mother, Jaymes Foster, is the sister of record producer David Foster, executive producer of Aiken&#x27;s last three albums on the RCA label. &quot;The little man is healthy, happy, and as loud as his daddy&quot;, Aiken wrote. &quot;Mama Jaymes is doing quite well also.&quot; In his book, &quot;Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life&quot;, Aiken said, &quot;It&#x27;s a Southern tradition to be given your first name from your grandmama&#x27;s maiden name.&quot; Aiken&#x27;s middle name came from his paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name; he and Foster used the married surnames of their mothers to name their son.

After several years of public speculation, Aiken came out as gay in a September 2008 interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine. He later said that his coming out caused him to lose &quot;fifty percent of [his] fanbase&quot; at the time. In April 2009, Aiken was honored by the Family Equality Council advocacy group at its annual benefit dinner in New York City.

On November 18, 2010, Aiken went to Washington, D.C., on behalf of Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) at a Capitol Hill briefing talking about anti-gay bullying.

===Faith and philosophy===
Aiken was born into a Baptist family. As a toddler, in 1980, he attended Leesville Baptist Church every week. According to his book, &quot;Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life&quot;, he was involved in Bible school, choir, and the youth group. The book made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in 2004, debuting at number two. It was written with Allison Glock and published by Random House. Barely mentioning &quot;American Idol&quot;, Aiken instead turned his focus to the people who had the most influence in his life—his mother, grandparents, siblings, teachers, and friends—and to the importance of religion in his life. He describes himself as a proud Southern Baptist who journeyed away from those roots in his late teens in search of a religion with more liberal social policies. He then returned to that church because of family and social ties, although he remains at odds with the church on some issues.

When asked in a &quot;PBS Kids&quot; interview to name his idols, he responded, &quot;When people ask me what three people I&#x27;d like to have dinner with, living or dead, I say Jesus Christ, Mr. Rogers, and Jimmy Carter.&quot;

While not self-identified as a Christian music artist, Aiken was featured in &quot;Christian Music Planet&quot; as an &quot;American Idol Christian&quot; in 2004, and in a cover story, &quot;Clay Aiken&#x27;s Balancing Act&quot;, in the January/February 2005 issue. His pre-&quot;Idol&quot; demo albums included several selections of Contemporary Christian Music (or CCM) and gospel songs. A performance of the Commodores&#x27; &quot;Jesus is Love&quot; at the American Music Awards in 2003 earned Aiken and Ruben Studdard a standing ovation. Aiken has sung a few CCM songs at his pop concerts and has made Christmas albums, Christmas television specials and performances, and Christmas tours essential elements of his career.

Aiken makes it clear that he is aware not everyone shares his religious beliefs and it is not his intention to press these beliefs on others. When he worked as a camp counselor at the YMCA, he challenged other camp faculty by insisting that singing &quot;overtly Christian songs&quot; was inappropriate, as some of the kids were Jewish. &quot;I stood firm ... no child is going to have a spiritual crisis on my watch.&quot; His public philosophy, geared towards inclusion and service to others, reflects his stance that decisions about religion should be made at home.

<text>The Sherwood number (Sh) (also called the mass transfer [[Nusselt number]]) is a dimensionless number used in mass-transfer operation. It represents the ratio of the total mass transfer rate (convection + diffusion) to the rate of diffusive mass transport, and is named in honor of Thomas Kilgore Sherwood.

It is defined as follows

:formula_1

where 
* &quot;L&quot; is a characteristic length (m)
* &quot;D&quot; is mass diffusivity (m2 s−1)
* &quot;h&quot; is the convective mass transfer film coefficient (m s−1)

Using dimensional analysis, it can also be further defined as a function of the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers: 
:formula_2

For example, for a single sphere it can be expressed as :

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the Sherwood number due only to natural convection and not forced convection.

A more specific correlation is the Froessling equation:

:formula_5

This form is applicable to molecular diffusion from a single spherical particle. It is particularly valuable in situations where the Reynolds number and Schmidt number are readily available. Since Re and Sc are both dimensionless numbers, the Sherwood number is also dimensionless.

These correlations are the mass transfer analogies to heat transfer correlations of the Nusselt number in terms of the Reynolds number and Prandtl number. For a correlation for a given geometry (e.g. spheres, plates, cylinders, etc.), a heat transfer correlation (often more readily available from literature and experimental work, and easier to determine) for the Nusselt number (Nu) in terms of the Reynolds number (Re) and the Prandtl number (Pr) can be used as a mass transfer correlation by replacing the Prandtl number with the analogous dimensionless number for mass transfer, the Schmidt number, and replacing the Nusselt number with the analogous dimensionless number for mass transfer, the Sherwood number.

As an example, a heat transfer correlation for spheres is given by the Ranz-Marshall Correlation:

:formula_6

This correlation can be made into a mass transfer correlation using the above procedure, which yields:

:formula_7

This is a very concrete way of demonstrating the analogies between different forms of transport phenomena.

<text>Abū al-ʿAbbās Abd Allāh ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] al-Maʾmūn (; 14 September 786 – 9 August 833), better known by his regnal name al-Ma&#x27;mun (), was the seventh Abbasid caliph, who reigned from 813 until his death in 833. He succeeded his half-brother al-Amin after a civil war, during which the cohesion of the Abbasid Caliphate was weakened by rebellions and the rise of local strongmen; much of his domestic reign was consumed in pacification campaigns. Well educated and with a considerable interest in scholarship, al-Ma&#x27;mun promoted the Translation Movement, the flowering of learning and the sciences in Baghdad, and the publishing of al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s book now known as &quot;Algebra&quot;. He is also known for supporting the doctrine of Mu&#x27;tazilism and for imprisoning Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the rise of religious persecution (&quot;mihna&quot;), and for the resumption of large-scale warfare with the Byzantine Empire.

==Birth and education==
Abdallah, the future al-Ma&#x27;mun, was born in Baghdad on the night of the 13 to 14 September 786 CE to Harun al-Rashid and his concubine Marajil, from Badghis. On the same night, which later became known as the &quot;night of the three caliphs&quot;, his uncle al-Hadi died and was succeeded by Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s father, Harun al-Rashid, as ruler of the Abbasid Caliphate. Marajil died soon after his birth, and Abdallah was raised by Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s wife, Zubayda, herself of high Abbasid lineage as the granddaughter of Caliph al-Mansur (). As a young prince, Abdallah received a thorough education: al-Kisa&#x27;i tutored him in classical Arabic, Abu Muhammad al-Yazidi in &quot;adab&quot;, and he received instruction in music and poetry. He was trained in &quot;fiqh&quot; by al-Hasan al-Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;i, showing particular excellence in the Hanafi school, and in the &quot;hadith&quot;, becoming himself active as a transmitter. According to M. Rekaya, &quot;he was distinguished by his love of knowledge, making him the most intellectual caliph of the Abbasid family, which accounts for the way in which his caliphate developed&quot;.

==Appointment as successor and Governor of Khurasan==
Although Abdallah was the oldest of his sons, in 794 Harun named the second-born Muhammad, born in April 787 to Zubayda, as the first in line of succession. This was the result of family pressure on the Caliph, reflecting Muhammad&#x27;s higher birth, as both parents descended from the Abbasid dynasty; indeed, he remained the only Abbasid caliph to claim such descent. Muhammad received the oath of allegiance (&quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot;) with the name of al-Amin (&quot;The Trustworthy&quot;), first in Khurasan by his guardian, the Barmakid al-Fadl ibn Yahya, and then in Baghdad. Abdallah was recognized as second heir only after entering puberty, in 799, under the name al-Ma&#x27;mun (&quot;The Trusted One&quot;), with another Barmakid, Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya, as his guardian. At the same time, a third heir, al-Qasim, named al-Mu&#x27;tamin, was appointed, under the guardianship of Abd al-Malik ibn Salih.

These arrangements were confirmed and publicly proclaimed in 802, when Harun and the most powerful officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma&#x27;mun would remain al-Amin&#x27;s heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged Khurasan. This was an appointment of particular significance, as Khurasan had been the starting point of the Abbasid Revolution which brought the Abbasids to power, and retained a privileged position among the Caliphate&#x27;s provinces. Furthermore, the Abbasid dynasty relied heavily on Khurasanis as military leaders and administrators. Many of the original Khurasani Arab army (&quot;Khurasaniyya&quot;) that came west with the Abbasids were given estates in Iraq and the new Abbasid capital, Baghdad, and became an elite group known as the &quot;abnāʾ al-dawla&quot; (&quot;sons of the state/dynasty&quot;). This large-scale presence of an Iranian element in the highest circles of the Abbasid state, with the Barmakid family as its most notable representatives, was certainly a factor in the appointment of al-Ma&#x27;mun, linked through his mother with the eastern Iranian provinces, as heir and governor of Khurasan. The stipulations of the agreement, which were recorded in detail by the historian al-Tabari, accorded al-Mamun&#x27;s Khurasani viceroyalty extensive autonomy. However, modern historians consider that these accounts may have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma&#x27;mun in the latter&#x27;s favour. Harun&#x27;s third heir, al-Mu&#x27;tamin, received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire in Upper Mesopotamia and Syria.

Very quickly, the latent rivalry between the two brothers had important repercussions: almost immediately after the court returned to Baghdad in January 803, the Abbasid elites were shaken by the abrupt fall of the Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this event may reflect the fact that the Barmakids had become indeed too powerful for the Caliph&#x27;s liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the &quot;abnāʾ&quot; and al-Ma&#x27;mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was to have a chance to succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken.

Al-Fadl ibn Sahl, a Kufan of Iranian origin whose father had converted to Islam and entered Barmakid service, replaced Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya as al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s tutor. In 806 he also became al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s secretary (&quot;katib&quot;), an appointment that marked him out as the chief candidate for the vizierate should al-Ma&#x27;mun succeed to the throne. In 804, al-Ma&#x27;mun married his cousin, Umm Isa, a daughter of the Caliph al-Hadi (). The couple had two sons, Muhammad al-Asghar and Abdallah.

The years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the &quot;abnāʾ&quot;, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad. This led to unrest in the provinces, especially Khurasan, where local elites had a long-standing rivalry with the &quot;aabnāʾ&quot; and their tendency to control the province (and its revenues) from Iraq. The harsh taxation imposed by a prominent member of the &quot;abnāʾ&quot;, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, even led to a revolt under Rafi ibn al-Layth, which eventually forced Harun himself, accompanied by al-Ma&#x27;mun and the powerful chamberlain (&quot;hajib&quot;) and chief minister al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, to travel to the province in 808. Al-Ma&#x27;mun was sent ahead with part of the army to Merv, while Harun stayed at Tus, where he died on 24 March 809.

==Abbasid civil war==

In 802 Harun al-Rashid, father of al-Maʾmūn and al-Amin, ordered that al-Amin succeed him, and al-Ma&#x27;mun serve as governor of Khurasan and as caliph after the death of al-Amin. In the last days of Harun&#x27;s life his health was declining and saw in a dream Musa ibn Jafar sitting in a chamber praying and crying, which made Harun remember how hard he had struggled to establish his own caliphate. He knew the personalities of both his sons and decided that for the good of the Abbasid dynasty, al-Maʾmūn should be caliph after his death, which he confided to a group of his courtiers. One of the courtiers, Fadl ibn Rabi&#x27;, did not abide by Harun&#x27;s last wishes and convinced many in the lands of Islam that Harun&#x27;s wishes had not changed. Later the other three courtiers of Harun who had sworn loyalty to Harun by supporting al-Maʾmūn, namely, &#x27;Isa Jarudi, Abu Yunus, and Ibn Abi &#x27;Umran, found loopholes in Fadl&#x27;s arguments, and Fazl admitted Harun had appointed al-Maʾmūn after him, but, he argued, since Harun was not in his right mind, his decision should not be acted upon. Al-Maʾmūn was reportedly the older of the two brothers, but his mother was a Persian woman while al-Amin&#x27;s mother was a member of the reigning Abbasid family. After al-Rashid&#x27;s death in 809, the relationship between the two brothers deteriorated. In response to al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s moves toward independence, al-Amin declared his own son Musa to be his heir. This violation of al-Rashid&#x27;s testament led to a succession struggle. Al-Amin assembled a massive army at Baghdad with &#x27;Isa ibn Mahan at its head in 811 and invaded Khorasan, but al-Maʾmūn&#x27;s general Tahir ibn al-Husayn (d. 822) destroyed the army and invaded Iraq, laying siege to Baghdad in 812. In 813 Baghdad fell, al-Amin was beheaded, and al-Maʾmūn became the undisputed Caliph.

==Internal strife==
===Sahl ibn Salama al-Ansari===
There were disturbances in Iraq during the first several years of al-Maʾmūn&#x27;s reign, while the caliph was in Merv (near present-day Mary, Turkmenistan). On 13 November 815, Muhammad ibn Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq (al-Dibaj) claimed the Caliphate for himself in Mecca. He was defeated and he quickly abdicated asserting that he had only become caliph on news that al-Ma&#x27;mun had died. Lawlessness in Baghdad led to the formation of neighborhood watches with religious inspiration, with two notable leaders being Khalid al-Daryush and Sahl ibn Salama al-Ansari. Sahl adopted the slogan, &quot;la ta&#x27;a lil- makhluq fi ma&#x27;siyat al-khaliq&quot;, or &#x27;no obedience to the creature in disobedience of the Creator&#x27; (originally a Kharijite slogan), alluding to what he saw as &quot;the conflict ... between God&#x27;s will and Caliphal authority&quot;. &quot;Most&quot; of the leadership of this vigilante movement came from the &quot;sulaahd&quot; (&quot;men of good will of the neighborhoods and blocks&quot;) and from &quot;popular preachers&quot; (as both Khalid al-Daryush and Sahl ibn Salama al-Ansari were); its followers were called the &quot; &#x27;amma&quot;, (the common people). The volunteers of the movement were known as &quot;mutawwi&#x27;a&quot;, which was the same name given to &quot;volunteers for frontier duty and for the holy war against Byzantium&quot;.
Sahl&#x27;s and movement influence was such that military chiefs first &quot;delayed capitulation to al-Ma&#x27;mun&quot; and adopted Sahl&#x27;s religious &quot;formula&quot; until they became alarmed at his power and combined to crush him in 817–18 CE.

===Imam al-Rida===
In A.H. 201 (817 AD) al-Ma&#x27;mun named Ali ar-Rida (the sixth-generation descendant of Ali and the eighth Shia Imam) as his heir as caliph. This move may have been made to appease Shi&#x27;ite opinion in Iraq and &quot;reconcile the &#x27;Alid and &#x27;Abbasid branches of the Hashimite family&quot;, but in Baghdad it caused the Hashimites—supported by &quot;military chiefs of al-Harbiyya, including Muttalib and &#x27;Isa ibn Muhammad&quot;—to depose al-Ma&#x27;mun and elect Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi Caliph.

According to Shia sources, the deposing of al-Ma&#x27;um in Baghdad was not out of opposition to the wise and pious Imam Reza, but because of rumors spread by Fazl ibn Sahl. Al-Ma&#x27;mun moved Imam Reza to Merv in hopes of keeping watch over him, but was foiled by the Imam&#x27;s growing popularity there. People from all over the Muslim world traveled to meet the prophet&#x27;s grandson and listen to his teachings and guidance (according to these sources). In an attempt to humiliate the Imam, al-Ma&#x27;mun set him up with the greatest scholars of the world&#x27;s religions, but the Imam prevailed and then informed al-Ma&#x27;mun that his grand vizier, Fazl ibn Sahl, had withheld important information from him.

In Baghdad, al-Maʾmūn was unseated and replaced by Ibrahim ibn Mehdi not because al-Maʾmūn&#x27;s naming Imam Reza as his heir was unpopular, but because of &quot;rumors&quot; spread by Fazl ibn Sahl.

Seeking to put down the rebellion in Baghdad, al-Ma&#x27;mun set out for the city on 12 April 818. At Tus, he stopped to visit his father&#x27;s grave. However, when they reached the town of Sarakhs, his vizier, Fazl ibn Sahl, was assassinated, and when they reached Tus, the Imam was poisoned. Al-Ma&#x27;mūn ordered that the Imam be buried next to the tomb of his own father, Harun al-Rashid, and showed extreme sorrow in the funeral ritual and stayed for three days at the place. Nonetheless, Shia tradition states he was killed on orders of al-Ma&#x27;mun, and according to Wilferd Madelung the unexpected death of both the vizier and the successor, &quot;whose presence would have made any reconciliation with the powerful ʿAbbasid opposition in Baghdad virtually impossible, must indeed arouse strong suspicion that Ma&#x27;mun had had a hand in the deaths.&quot;

Following the death of Imam Reza, a revolt took place in Khurasan. Al-Ma’mun tried unsuccessfully to absolve himself of the crime.

== After arrival in Baghdad ==

The rebel forces in Baghdad splintered and wavered in opposition to al-Ma&#x27;mun. According to scholar and historian al-Tabari (839–923 CE), al-Ma&#x27;mun entered Baghdad on 11 August 819. He wore green and had others do so. Informed that compliance with this command might arouse popular opposition to the colour, on 18 August he reverted to traditional Abbasid black. While Baghdad became peaceful, there were disturbances elsewhere. In AH 210 (825–826 CE) Abdullah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani secured Egypt for al-Ma&#x27;mun, freeing Alexandria from Andalusians and quelling unrest. The Andalusians moved to Crete, where al-Tabari records their descendants were still living in his day (see Emirate of Crete). Abdallah returned to Baghdad in 211 Hijri (826–827 CE), bringing the defeated rebels with him.

Also, in 210 Hijri (825–826 CE), there was an uprising in Qum, sparked by complaints about taxes. After it was quashed, the tax assessment was set significantly higher. In 212 Hijri (827–828 CE), there was an uprising in Yemen. In 214 (829–30 CE), Abu al-Razi, who had captured one Yemeni rebel, was killed by another. Egypt continued to be unquiet. Sindh was rebellious. In 216 (831–832 CE), Ghassan ibn &#x27;Abbad subdued it. An ongoing problem for al-Ma&#x27;mun was the uprising headed by Babak Khorramdin. In 214 Babak routed a Caliphate army, killing its commander Muhammad ibn Humayd.

==Wars with Byzantium==
By the time al-Ma&#x27;mun became Caliph, the Arabs and the Byzantine Empire had settled down into border skirmishing, with Arab raids deep into Anatolia to capture booty and Christians to be enslaved. The situation changed however with the rise to power of Michael II in 820 AD. Forced to deal with the rebel Thomas the Slav, Michael had few troops to spare against a small Andalusian invasion of 40 ships and 10,000 men against Crete, which fell in 824 AD. A Byzantine counter offensive in 826 AD failed miserably. Worse still was the invasion of Sicily in 827 by Arabs of Tunis. Even so, Byzantine resistance in Sicily was fierce and not without success whilst the Arabs became quickly plagued by internal squabbles. That year, the Arabs were expelled from Sicily but they were to return.
In 829, Michael II died and was succeeded by his son Theophilos. Theophilos experienced mixed success against his Arab opponents. In 830 AD the Arabs returned to Sicily and, after a year-long siege, took Palermo. For the next 200 years they were to remain there to complete their conquest, which was never short of Christian counters. Al-Ma&#x27;mun meanwhile launched an invasion of Anatolia in 830 AD, taking a number of Byzantine forts; he spared the surrendering Byzantines. Theophilos, for his part, captured Tarsus in 831. The next year, learning the Byzantines had killed some sixteen hundred people, al-Ma&#x27;mun returned. This time some thirty forts fell to the Caliphate&#x27;s forces, with two Byzantine defeats in Cappadocia.

Theophilos wrote to al-Ma&#x27;mun. The Caliph replied that he carefully considered the Byzantine ruler&#x27;s letter, noticed it blended suggestions of peace and trade with threats of war and offered Theophilos the options of accepting the shahada, paying tax or fighting. Al-Ma&#x27;mun made preparations for a major campaign, but died on the way while leading an expedition in Tyana.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s relations with the Byzantines are marked by his efforts in the translation of Greek philosophy and science. Al-Ma&#x27;mun gathered scholars of many religions at Baghdad, whom he treated magnificently. He sent an emissary to the Byzantine Empire to collect the most famous manuscripts there, and had them translated into Arabic. As part of his peace treaty with the Byzantine Emperor, al-Ma&#x27;mun was to receive a number of Greek manuscripts annually, one of these being Ptolemy&#x27;s astronomical work, the &quot;Almagest&quot;.

== al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s reign ==
Al-Ma&#x27;mun conducted, in the plains of Mesopotamia, two astronomical operations intended to achieve a degree measurement (al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s arc measurement). The crater Almanon on the Moon is named in recognition of his contributions to astronomy.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s record as an administrator is also marked by his efforts toward the centralization of power and the certainty of succession. The &quot;Bayt al-Hikma&quot;, or House of Wisdom, was established during his reign. The &quot;ulama&quot; emerged as a real force in Islamic politics during al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s reign for opposing the &quot;mihna&quot;, which was initiated in 833, four months before he died.

Michael Hamilton Morgan in his book &quot;Lost History&quot; describes al-Ma&#x27;mun as a man who &#x27;Loves Learning.&#x27; al-Ma&#x27;mun once defeated a Byzantine Emperor in a battle and as a tribute, he asked for a copy of &quot;Almagest,&quot; Ptolemy&#x27;s Hellenistic compendium of thoughts on astronomy written around AD 150.

The &#x27;mihna&#x27;, is comparable to Medieval European inquisitions in the sense that it involved imprisonment, a religious test, and a loyalty oath. The people subject to the mihna were traditionalist scholars whose social influence was uncommonly high. Al-Ma&#x27;mun introduced the mihna with the intention of centralizing religious power in the caliphal institution and testing the loyalty of his subjects. The mihna had to be undergone by elites, scholars, judges and other government officials, and consisted of a series of questions relating to theology and faith. The central question was about the createdness of the Qur&#x27;an. If the interrogatee stated he believed the Qur&#x27;an to be created, rather than coeternal with God, he was free to leave and continue his profession.

The controversy over the &quot;mihna&quot; was exacerbated by al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s sympathy for Mu&#x27;tazili theology and other controversial views. Mu&#x27;tazili theology was deeply influenced by Aristotelian thought and Greek rationalism, and stated that matters of belief and practice should be decided by reasoning. This opposed the traditionalist and literalist position of Ahmad ibn Hanbal and others, according to which everything a believer needed to know about faith and practice was spelled out literally in the Qur&#x27;an and the Hadith. Moreover, the Mu&#x27;tazilis stated that the Qur&#x27;an was created rather than coeternal with God, a belief that was shared by the Jahmites and parts of Shi&#x27;a, among others, but contradicted the traditionalist-Sunni opinion that the Qur&#x27;an and the Divine were coeternal.

During his reign, alchemy greatly developed. Pioneers of the science were Jabir Ibn Hayyan and his student Yusuf Lukwa, who was patronized by al-Ma&#x27;mun. Although he was unsuccessful in transmuting gold, his methods greatly led to the patronization of pharmaceutical compounds.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun was a pioneer of cartography having commissioned a world map from a large group of astronomers and geographers. The map is presently in an encyclopedia in Topkapi Sarai, a Museum in Istanbul. The map shows large parts of the Eurasian and African continents with recognizable coastlines and major seas. It depicts the world as it was known to the captains of the Arab sailing dhows which used the monsoon wind cycles to trade over vast distances (by the 9th century, Arab sea traders had reached Guangzhou, in China). The maps of the Greeks and Romans reveal a good knowledge of closed seas like the Mediterranean but little knowledge of the vast ocean expanses beyond.

Although al-Mahdi had proclaimed that the caliph was the protector of Islam against heresy, and had also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy, religious scholars in the Islamic world believed that al-Ma&#x27;mun was overstepping his bounds in the &quot;mihna&quot;. The penalties of the &quot;mihna&quot; became increasingly difficult to enforce as the &quot;ulema&quot; became firmer and more united in their opposition. Although the &quot;mihna&quot; persisted through the reigns of two more caliphs, al-Mutawakkil abandoned it in 851.

The &quot;ulema&quot; and the major Islamic law schools became truly defined in the period of al-Ma&#x27;mun, and Sunnism—as a religion of legalism—became defined in parallel. Doctrinal differences between Sunni and Shi&#x27;a Islam began to become more pronounced. Ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali legal school, became famous for his opposition to the &quot;mihna&quot;. Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s simultaneous opposition and patronage of intellectuals led to the emergence of important dialogues on both secular and religious affairs, and the &quot;Bayt al-Hikma&quot; became an important center of translation for Greek and other ancient texts into Arabic. This Islamic renaissance spurred the rediscovery of Hellenism and ensured the survival of these texts into the European Renaissance.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun had been named governor of Khurasan by Harun, and after his ascension to power, the caliph named Tahir as governor for his military services in order to assure his loyalty. It was a move that al-Ma&#x27;mun soon regretted, as Tahir and his family became entrenched in Iranian politics and became increasingly powerful in the state, contrary to al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s desire to centralize and strengthen Caliphal power. The rising power of the Tahirid family became a threat as al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s own policies alienated them and his other opponents.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun also attempted to divorce his wife during his reign, who had not borne him any children. His wife hired a Syrian judge of her own before al-Ma&#x27;mun was able to select one himself; the judge, who sympathized with the caliph&#x27;s wife, refused the divorce. Following al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s experience, no further Abbasid caliphs were to marry, preferring to find their heirs in the harem.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun, in an attempt to win over the Shi&#x27;a Muslims to his camp, named the eighth Imam, Ali ar-Rida, his successor, if he should outlive al-Ma&#x27;mun. Most Shi&#x27;ites realized, however, that ar-Rida was too old to survive him and saw al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s gesture as empty; indeed, al-Ma&#x27;mun poisoned Ali ar-Rida who then died in 818. The incident served to further alienate the Shi&#x27;ites from the Abbasids, who had already been promised and denied the Caliphate by Abu al-&#x27;Abbas.

The Abbasid empire grew somewhat during the reign of al-Ma&#x27;mun. Hindu rebellions in Sindh were put down, and most of Afghanistan was absorbed with the surrender of the leader of Kabul. Mountainous regions of Iran were brought under a tighter grip of the central Abbasid government, as were areas of Turkestan.

In 832, al-Ma&#x27;mun led a large army into Egypt to put down the last great Bashmurite revolt.

==Personal characteristics==
Al-Tabari (v. 32, p. 231) describes al-Ma&#x27;mun as of average height, light complexion, handsome and having a long beard that lost its dark colour as he aged. He relates anecdotes concerning the caliph&#x27;s ability to speak concisely and eloquently without preparation, his generosity, his respect for Muhammad and religion, his sense of moderation, justice, his love of poetry and his insatiable passion for physical intimacy.

Ibn Abd Rabbih in his &quot;Unique Necklace&quot; (al-&#x27;iqd al-Farid), probably drawing on earlier sources, makes a similar description of al-Ma&#x27;mun, whom he described as of light complexion and having slightly blond hair, a long thin beard, and a narrow forehead.

==Family==
Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s first wife was Umm Isa, a daughter of his uncle al-Hadi (), whom he married in 804, when he was eighteen years old. They had two sons, Muhammad al-Asghar, and Abdallah. Another wife was Buran, the daughter of al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s vizier, al-Hasan ibn Sahl. She was born as Khadija on 6 December 807. Al-Ma&#x27;mun married her in 817, and consummated the marriage with her in December 825–January 826 in the town of Fam al-Silh. She died on 21 September 884.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun had also numerous concubines. One of them, Sundus, bore him five sons, among whom was al-Abbas, who rose to become a senior military commander at the end of al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s reign and a contender for the throne. Her other sons were Harun, Ahmad, Isa and Isma&#x27;il. Another concubine was Arib. Born in 797, she claimed to be the daughter of Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya, the Barmakid, stolen and sold as a child when the Barmakids fell from power. She was brought by al-Amin, who then sold her to his brother. She was a noted poet, singer, and musician. She died at Samarra in July–August 890, aged ninety-three. Another concubine was Bi&#x27;dah, known by her epithet &quot;al-Kabirah&quot;. She was also a singer, and had been a slave of Arib. She died on 10 July 915. Abu Bakr, the son of Caliph al-Muhtadi, led the funeral prayers. Another concubine was Mu&#x27;nisah, a Greek. She was one of his favourites. Another concubine was Tatrif, also known as Tazayyuf. She was an accomplished poet and a native of Basra. She was noted for beauty and elegance, and it was said that al-Ma&#x27;mun favoured her above all his other concubines. She was inconsolable at his death and mourned him in many poems. Another concubine was Badhal. She had been formerly a concubine of his cousin Ja&#x27;far bin al-Hadi, his brother al-Amin and Ali bin Hisham. She hailed from Medina and was raised in Basra. Described as charming with fair skin, she was praised for her musical talent, particularly her skill in playing instruments, and was known for her exceptional ability as a songwriter and singer. After al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s death, his brother al-Mu&#x27;tasim married her. Another concubine was Nu&#x27;n. She was a singer. Another concubine was Nasim. She was a poetess and was one of his favourites.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun had another son named Musa. He had three daughters. One was Umm Habib, who married Ali ibn Musa al-Rida. Another daughter was Umm al-Fadl, who married Muhammad ibn Ali bin Musa in 818. Another daughter Khadija was a poetess.

==Death and legacy==
Al-Tabari recounts how al-Ma&#x27;mun was sitting on the river bank telling those with him how splendid the water was. He asked what would go best with this water and was told a specific kind of fresh dates. Noticing supplies arriving, he asked someone to check whether such dates were included. As they were, he invited those with him to enjoy the water with these dates. All who did this fell ill. Others recovered, but al-Ma&#x27;mun died. He encouraged his successor to continue his policies and not burden the people with more than they could bear. This was on 9 August 833.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun died near Tarsus. The city&#x27;s major mosque (Tarsus Grand Mosque), contains a tomb reported to be his. Al-Ma&#x27;mun had made no official provisions for his succession. His son, al-Abbas, was old enough to rule and had acquired experience of command in the border wars with the Byzantines, but had not been named heir. According to the account of al-Tabari, on his deathbed al-Ma&#x27;mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as caliph on 9August, with the Laqab of al-Mu&#x27;tasim (in full &quot;al-Muʿtaṣim bi’llāh&quot;, &quot;he who seeks refuge in God&quot;). It is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events, or whether the letter was an invention and Abu Ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to his dying brother, and al-Abbas&#x27;s absence, to propel himself to the throne. As Abu Ishaq was the forefather of all subsequent Abbasid caliphs, later historians had little desire to question the legitimacy of his accession, but it is clear that his position was far from secure: a large part of the army favoured al-Abbas, and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as the new Caliph. Only when al-Abbas refused them, whether out of weakness or out of a desire to avoid a civil war, and himself took the oath of allegiance to his uncle, did the soldiers acquiesce in al-Mu&#x27;tasim&#x27;s succession.
Almanon, a lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged highlands in the south-central region of the Moon, was named after al-Ma&#x27;mun.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun was the last Abbasid caliph who had a one-word Laqab, his successors had laqab with suffixes like &quot;Billah&quot; or &quot;alā Allāh&quot;.

His nephew, Harun (future &quot;al-Wathiq&quot;) learned calligraphy, recitation and literature from his uncle, Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun. Later sources nickname him the &quot;Little Ma&#x27;mun&quot; on account of his erudition and moral character.

==Religious beliefs==

Al-Maʾmūn&#x27;s religious beliefs are a subject of controversy, to the point where other Abbasids, as well as later Islamic scholars, called him a Shia Muslim. For instance, Sunni scholars al-Dhahabi, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Khaldun and al-Suyuti explicitly held the belief that al-Ma&#x27;mun was a Shi&#x27;a. The arguments for his supposed Shi’ism include that, in 816/817, when Ali al-Rida, the Prophet&#x27;s descendant, refused designation as sole Caliph, al-Ma&#x27;mun officially designated him as his appointed successor. The official Abbasid coins were minted showing al-Ma&#x27;mun as a Caliph and al-Ridha as his successor. Other arguments were that: the Caliphate&#x27;s official black colour was changed to the Prophetic green; in 210 AH/825 CE, he wrote to Qutham b. Ja&#x27;far, the ruler of Medina, to return Fadak to the descendants of Muhammad through his daughter, Fatima; he restored nikah mut&#x27;ah, previously banned by Umar ibn al-Khattab, but practiced under Muhammad and Abu Bakr; in 211 AH/826 CE, al-Ma&#x27;mun reportedly expressed his antipathy to those who praised Mu&#x27;awiya I, the founder and first caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, and reportedly punished such people; this later view of al-Suyuti however is questionable since it contradicts the fact that al-Ma’mun promoted scholars who openly defended Muawiyah, such as the Mu’tazilite scholar Hisham bin Amr al-Fuwati, who was a well-respected judge in the court of al-Ma’mun in Baghdad; in 212 AH/827 CE, al-Ma&#x27;mun announced the superiority of Ali ibn Abu Talib over Abu Bakr and Umar b. al-Khattab; in 833 CE, under the influence of Muʿtazila rationalist thought, he initiated the mihna ordeal, where he accepted the argument that the Quran was created at some point over the orthodox Sunni belief that the Book is the uncreated word of God.

However, Shi’ites condemn al-Ma&#x27;mun as well due to the belief that he was responsible for Ali al-Ridha&#x27;s poisoning and eventual death in 818 CE. In the ensuing power struggle, other Abbasids sought to depose Ma&#x27;mun in favor of Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s uncle; therefore, getting rid of al-Ridha was the only realistic way of retaining united, absolute, unopposed rule. Al-Ma&#x27;mūn ordered that al-Ridha be buried next to the tomb of his own father, Harun al-Rashid, and showed extreme sorrow in the funeral ritual and stayed for three days at the place. Muhammad al-Jawad, Ali al-Ridha&#x27;s son and successor, lived unopposed and free during the rest of al-Ma&#x27;mūn’s reign (till 833 CE). The Caliph summoned al-Jawad to Baghdad in order to marry his daughter, Ummul Fadhl. This apparently provoked strenuous objections by the Abbasids. According to Ya&#x27;qubi, al-Ma&#x27;mun gave al-Jawad one hundred thousand &quot;dirham&quot; and said, &quot;Surely I would like to be a grandfather in the line of the Apostle of God and of Ali ibn Abu Talib.&quot;

<text>The Japanese Grand Prix () is a motor racing event in the calendar of the Formula One World Championship. Historically, Japan has been one of the last races of the season, and as such the Japanese Grand Prix has been the venue for many title-deciding races, with 13 World Drivers&#x27; Champions being crowned over the 36 World Championship Japanese Grands Prix that have been hosted. Japan was the only Asian nation to host a Formula One race (including the Pacific Grand Prix) until Malaysia joined the calendar in 1999.

The first two Formula One Japanese Grands Prix in 1976 and 1977 were held at the Fuji Speedway, before Japan was taken off the calendar. It returned in 1987 at Suzuka, which hosted the Grand Prix exclusively for 20 years and gained a reputation as one of the most challenging Formula One circuits. In 1994 and 1995, Japan also hosted the Pacific Grand Prix at the TI Circuit, making Japan one of only nine countries to host more than one Grand Prix in the same season (the others being Austria, Bahrain, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain and the USA). In 2007 the Grand Prix moved back to the newly redesigned Fuji Speedway. After a second race at Fuji in 2008, the race returned to Suzuka in 2009, as part of an alternating agreement between the owners of Fuji Speedway and Suzuka Circuit, perennial rivals Toyota and Honda. However, in July 2009, Toyota announced it would not host the race at Fuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond due to a downturn in the global economy, and so the Japanese Grand Prix was held at Suzuka instead. Suzuka has hosted the Japanese Grand Prix every year since 2009, apart from in 2020 and 2021 when the Grands Prix were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The event is due to take place at the Suzuka Circuit until at least 2029.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The first Japanese Grand Prix was run as a sports car race at the Suzuka Circuit south west of Nagoya in May 1963. In 1964, the race was held at Suzuka again. This marked the beginning of motor racing in earnest in Japan. For the next eight installments, however, the non-championship Grand Prix was run at the Fuji Speedway, west of Yokohama and west of the Japanese capital of Tokyo. At the time, the circuit (which was actually an incomplete circuit) featured Daiichi, the opening banked turn, which was the scene of many fatal accidents (removed in 1974). It was then run as a number of disciplines of motorsports, particularly Formula 2, sports cars and Can-Am-type sprint racing.

===Formula One===

====Fuji Speedway====

The first Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix, in 1976, was held at the very fast 2.7-mile Fuji Speedway, minus the banking. The race was to become famous for the title decider between James Hunt and Niki Lauda as it was held during monsoon conditions. Lauda, who had survived a near-fatal crash at the German Grand Prix earlier in the season, withdrew from the race stating that his life was more important than the championship, as did Brazilians Emerson Fittipaldi and Carlos Pace. The torrential rain eventually stopped, and after a slow pit stop that put him down to 5th, Hunt drove hard and climbed up to 3rd, taking the 4 points he needed to win the title by the slender margin of one point over Lauda. American Mario Andretti won the race for his 2nd career win and first for Lotus, ahead of Frenchman Patrick Depailler in the Tyrrell P34. Hunt returned the next year to win the second Japanese Grand Prix, but a collision between Gilles Villeneuve and Ronnie Peterson during the race saw Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari somersault into a restricted area, killing two spectators. Although originally scheduled for an April slot in the 1978 season (which was cancelled), the race did not reappear on the Formula One calendar for another decade, and the race did not return to Fuji for an even greater time.

====Suzuka Circuit====
The Japanese Grand Prix, originally scheduled for 7 April 1985 was cancelled as rebuilding parts of the Suzuka Circuit were too time-consuming. On Formula 1&#x27;s return to Japan in 1987, the Grand Prix found a new venue at the redesigned and revamped Suzuka Circuit. The circuit, set inside a funfair, was designed by Dutchman John Hugenholtz and owned by Honda, who used it as a test track. Most notable initially for its layout—Suzuka is the only figure-eight race track to appear on the F1 calendar—the demanding and fast Japanese circuit became very popular among drivers and fans, and it was to see some of the most dramatic and memorable moments in Formula One history.

The first event in 1987 was already a classic. It immediately saw another World Title decided, as Nigel Mansell crashed his Williams-Honda heavily in practice at the Snake Esses and consequently could not start the race due to aggravating an old back injury he had received in his Formula Ford days, effectively handing the title to his teammate Nelson Piquet; the 3rd and final title of his career. Austrian Gerhard Berger won the race for Ferrari, their first victory since 1985.

====Alain Prost versus Ayrton Senna====

Suzuka played a part in the feud between Frenchman Alain Prost and Brazilian Ayrton Senna. This long battle reached immense levels of controversy and media coverage; this struggle was between two men who were both considered to be by far the best drivers in Formula One at that time.

The 1988 race was a World Championship decider between Senna and Prost – who were McLaren teammates that year. Senna came in with a greater chance of winning the championship, as the points system in those days counted the best 11 results; Senna had retired from one more Grand Prix than Prost had and had been slightly less consistent than the Frenchman, yet this was actually to the Brazilian&#x27;s advantage; the way the points system worked in those days meant that there was more room for him to score points. McLaren also had obtained superior and fuel-efficient Honda engines from Williams, had a car far better than any of the others, and had won every race of the season except the Italian Grand Prix – McLaren&#x27;s only double retirement of the season. At the start, Senna made a very bad start, stalling on the grid but then managing to bump-start his car on the down-sloping pit straight. As a result, he dropped to 14th, while Prost took the lead. It then began to rain, and wet-weather specialist Senna stormed around the track, setting a number of fastest laps and passing car after car until he caught Berger in 2nd and then started to catch Prost rapidly. The Frenchman&#x27;s gearbox was malfunctioning, and the Brazilian caught and passed Prost while the Frenchman was delayed by consistent backmarker Andrea de Cesaris. Senna won the race and his first Drivers&#x27; Championship with Prost finishing 2nd, despite the latter scoring more points overall.

The 1989 race was a highly anticipated race, and even with new regulations banning turbo-charged engines, the McLaren-Honda combination was still dominant, they had won 10 of 14 races so far in the season. This race turned out to be one of the most memorable in the sport&#x27;s history. Prost and Senna, once again McLaren teammates for 1989, were both embroiled in an acrimonious personal feud that had started at the second race of the season and their relationship was, come the race weekend, at such a low point it was virtually non-existent. Very unusual for teammates of a racing team, there was almost zero communication going on between Prost and Senna, and was to the degree where the McLaren team were effectively running as 2 separate teams – with 4 to 5 times more people around Senna than Prost. This was because Senna had a closer relationship with the Honda engineers than Prost; Senna&#x27;s popularity with the Japanese public thanks to his flat-out driving style benefited Honda in many different ways; and McLaren wanted a long-term partnership with Honda, as their engines were better than all the others. Both Senna and Prost went into the race weekend each knowing what the stakes were. Prost was 16 points ahead of Senna, and the Brazilian was facing nearly insurmountable odds: he had to win at Suzuka to stand any chance of staying in contention of winning the championship going into the next race, which he was obliged to win as well. Senna qualified on pole position 1.5 seconds ahead of Prost who was already working on his race setup in qualifying. Senna&#x27;s set up meant he was faster around corners, while Prost opted for a set up that made him faster on the straights.

Come race day, the two McLarens were on the front row of the grid, and both McLaren drivers&#x27; emotions were running very high. As the starting lights flashed to green, Prost made an excellent start and jumped into the fast first corner ahead of Senna. The two McLaren drivers immediately started to pull away from the rest of the field, with Prost and Senna setting the pace at the highest possible level they could muster. On lap 47, going through the ultra-fast 130R corner, the Brazilian attempted an ambitious pass going into the Casio chicane. Senna was in an awkward position to pass, being on the inside of his teammate, and tried to shove his way past Prost, but the Frenchman decided to be true to words he had said to Senna and McLaren boss Ron Dennis: he would not leave the door open as he had before and give up the position simply for McLaren to be embarrassed by a double retirement. And Prost did exactly that: as he turned into the right handed turn that made up the first part of the chicane, he turned into Senna, and the Frenchman&#x27;s car hit the Brazilian&#x27;s car and the two cars were interlocked and both slid off the track and up the chicane&#x27;s escape road, the Honda V10 engines in both cars stalling.

Prost and Senna were both beached and Prost got out of his car promptly, knowing he had won the championship with Senna&#x27;s apparent retirement whilst Senna waved towards a group of Suzuka&#x27;s track marshals, who ran up to the two interlocked cars. So they could separate the two cars, the marshals pushed Senna&#x27;s car backwards onto the track, which put it in a dangerous position. The marshals then pushed his car forwards while Senna bump-started the engine, and he drove off. Even after being stalled for more than 30 seconds, the furious pace he and Prost had been running at put them both so far ahead of the rest of the field that Senna was still leading the race comfortably in front of Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini. Senna&#x27;s front nose cone was damaged and going through the Degner bend, it came off; and he pitted to have it changed. Nannini had passed Senna while the Brazilian was in the pits, and after he stormed out of the pits, Senna drove as furiously as he had before, and within 2 laps while making up 2.5 seconds a lap on Nannini he caught and passed the Italian cleanly at the Casio chicane. Senna took the chequered flag, but the podium ceremony proceeded to be delayed. A meeting between Senna, Prost, the McLaren management and FIA officials including the very unpopular FIA and FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre took place immediately post-race. It was thought that Senna was going to be disqualified for receiving external non-team assistance, which was against the rules, but that rule had a loophole: the rule read that if a driver was deemed to be in a dangerous position, they could be push started. But much to almost the entire Formula One paddock&#x27;s astonishment, it was deemed that Senna was to be disqualified for bypassing the chicane and the marked track after making his way down an escape road bordering the circuit. Cutting the chicane was in effect bypassing the track to gain an advantage – and this was illegal. But this rule was not enforced and generally ignored in those days if a driver was negatively affected in terms of where they stood in the race – which Senna was not. Nevertheless, the Brazilian Senna was infuriated by the decision – and he later said that he struggled to cope for a long time with what happened. Nannini was handed the race victory as a result of Senna&#x27;s disqualification, and McLaren appealed Senna&#x27;s disqualification – which was not only denied by Balestre and the FIA but he was handed a $100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, both of which were eventually rescinded. Prost had won the Drivers&#x27; Championship for the third time – but this was not official until Senna&#x27;s retirement from the Australian Grand Prix 2 weeks later, before which McLaren&#x27;s appeal had been denied.

The 1990 event proved to be just as controversial as the 1989 event. Senna and Prost were once again first and second in the championship – the two men had won 37 of the past 46 Formula One championship races. But the roles had been reversed: the championship situation for Prost was the same as Senna&#x27;s in the previous year. The Frenchman needed to win both of the final two races to defend the title. The race also was without defending champion Nannini, as his career ended just days after a helicopter crash. As shown in a video of the pre-race drivers&#x27; briefing, the drivers were discussing what was to be done if a car was in a dangerous position at the Casio Chicane. Senna was appalled at what he saw as a ridiculous interpretation of badly thought-out rules – and he walked out of the meeting as it was taking place. Senna qualified on pole position, three-tenths ahead of Prost, now driving for Ferrari, who had the next most competitive package that year behind McLaren. Senna requested to change the grid positions in order to move pole position to the cleaner left side of the road, where the racing line was. This was granted, but Balestre intervened and reverted the grid positions back to their original locations, meaning pole position would be on the dirty right side of the track, where all the bits of tire rubber had been thrown from the tires by the Formula One cars. This meant Senna was off the racing line and it would be more difficult for him to make a better start. Frustrated and angry, Senna mimicked Prost&#x27;s statement of the previous year saying he would not move over if Prost attempted to overtake in the first corner. Senna started from pole, with Prost second (albeit on the racing line). Prost got ahead of Senna – but the more powerful Honda engine in Senna&#x27;s McLaren meant that he was able to make up a bit of ground. Prost moved over to take the racing line, but Senna dived into the corner to Prost&#x27;s right to pass him – and as a result he hit the side of Prost&#x27;s Ferrari. Both cars went straight on and both drivers sped through the gravel trap at 160 mph (260 km/h) and crashed into the tyre wall at the end of the run-off area. Senna and Prost were both unhurt, and neither driver bothered to check to see if the other was okay. This accident meant that Senna won his second world Drivers&#x27; Championship. The crash looked somewhat dubious, and nothing was done to Senna by the FIA; because they had done nothing to Prost in 1989 for crashing to Senna, they could not do anything to Senna either, with the collision being declared a &quot;racing incident&quot; in the end. Furious and disgusted, Prost later described Senna as &quot;a man without value&quot;. Both drivers have been accused of crashing into the other deliberately and thus the two situations as well as their comments after both incidents have tainted both drivers&#x27; reputations in the eyes of most but die-hard fans. Benetton driver Nelson Piquet won his first race in 3 years after Gerhard Berger went off and Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Ferrari failed in the pits after a pit stop, and Piquet&#x27;s new teammate Roberto Moreno finished 2nd.

====1991–2006====
1991 was yet again the showdown for the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and it saw Senna and this time Mansell in a competitive but rather unreliable Williams battle for the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Prost did not win a race in his uncompetitive Ferrari that year and it turned out to be his last race for the Scuderia that year; he was fired from the team after the race for describing the 643 as having handling like &quot;a truck&quot;. This was the last straw for Ferrari; as Prost had been making unsavory comments about the Italian team for some time. The race started, and Mansell went off at the first corner on lap 10, and Senna won his 3rd Drivers&#x27; Championship in 4 seasons. Senna let his teammate Gerhard Berger through to win as a &quot;thank you&quot; gesture for his support all season. But during the post-race press conference, Senna then admitted that his actions in 1990 were indeed intentional, and he then called Balestre and the rest of the governing body &quot;stupid people&quot;. He admitted that he did what he did the year before because of his refusal to put up with Balestre&#x27;s continuously illegal manipulation of the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

1992 was the first year in which the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka did not in any way determine the championship – Mansell had already won it 4 races before in Hungary with his all-dominant Williams. He retired from the race, as did Senna, and Mansell&#x27;s teammate Riccardo Patrese took his only victory that year. 1993 was an interesting event; Senna took the lead from Alain Prost (who had won his 4th drivers&#x27; title at the previous race) and kept it; additionally, the changeable weather conditions played to Senna&#x27;s advantage, who was known to be exceptional in wet-weather conditions. He was harassed, however, by Briton newcomer Eddie Irvine, who attempted to pass Senna and unlap himself while battling with Prost&#x27;s British teammate Damon Hill. Senna won his 40th race in his career from Prost, but he wasn&#x27;t all smiles. He sought out Irvine, had a heated discussion with the Northern Irishman and punched him in the side of the head; then Senna went on live television for post-race interviews, and used profanity on the live recording in frustration at Irvine, other drivers&#x27; alleged bad behavior on the track and at the media, who he claimed were &quot;irresponsible&quot; for sensationalizing some of Senna&#x27;s dangerous on-track behavior.

By 1994, Prost had retired and Senna was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix, and the Japanese GP that year saw Hill and German Michael Schumacher battle for the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Hill crucially won the race ahead of Schumacher; Suzuka was hammered by a torrential downpour which made conditions very difficult for Hill as Schumacher was an acknowledged specialist in wet-weather conditions. 1995 saw an incredible drive from French-Italian Jean Alesi on dry slick tyres in damp conditions. It had rained at the start; but the track was drying. Alesi went into the pits on lap seven, around the time everyone else came in. The French driver began to lap Suzuka in his Ferrari 5 seconds faster than anyone else, and when he came out of the pits, he was 17th – but then over the course of 18 laps climbed to 2nd place, passing car after car while a number of the other cars changed to slick tyres as well. But then Alesi had to serve a drive-through penalty for jumping the start. This did not stop the emotionally highly-strung Alesi: he dropped down to 10th, but pushed hard; and began passing car after car. He then went into the pits and dropped to 13th from 8th as a result. Then he had gone off in the last corner on lap 20 but recovered, and as a result dropped further down the order to 15th. He then went from 15th to 9th in one lap and got into 2nd again behind Schumacher, whom he caught up to and battled with for the lead. This remarkable performance was only to last 5 laps, however: Alesi&#x27;s Ferrari&#x27;s driveshaft failed as a result of his excursion earlier and he retired from the race. Schumacher won the race, having already won the Drivers&#x27; Championship at the Pacific Grand Prix at Aida.

1996 was the last race of the year, and it saw Williams teammates Jacques Villeneuve and Damon Hill&#x27;s title struggle come to a showdown at Suzuka. Villeneuve lost a wheel on lap 37 and went off at the first sequence of corners, handing the drivers&#x27; title to Damon Hill; however, Hill was never as competitive as he was ever again in Formula One: team owners Frank Williams and Patrick Head decided earlier in the season not to renew Hill&#x27;s contract.

1997 saw Michael Schumacher win and his title rival Jacques Villeneuve disqualified for ignoring yellow flags during one of the practice sessions.

1998 saw another dramatic title decider between Schumacher and Finn Mika Häkkinen. The two drivers had dueled all season long and Hakkinen led Schumacher by four points heading in the final race at Suzuka. Schumacher started on pole for the race but stalled on the grid, giving Hakkinen in second a clear track in front of him for the start. Now starting from the back of the grid, Schumacher fought hard to catch up, setting numerous fastest laps in his effort to catch his rival. However, on lap 28 a collision between backmarkers resulted in debris being scattered on the circuit. Schumacher ran over the debris, puncturing his right rear tire. The tire caused Schumacher&#x27;s retirement three laps later, leaving Häkkinen to take victory and his first drivers&#x27; championship.

Hakkinen then won his second consecutive drivers&#x27; title in 1999, after a fight with Eddie Irvine, Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari teammate.

The next 5 events were all won by Ferrari; Schumacher won in 2000–2002 and 2004, and his teammate Rubens Barrichello won in 2003. Schumacher won his 3rd title at the 2000 event: he took advantage of his superior speed in damp conditions during a mid-race rain shower to secure the race win and his first World Championship title for Ferrari. This was Ferrari&#x27;s first drivers&#x27; championship in 21 years. Ferrari completed their domination of the 2002 season by reaching a total points tally of 221 points on the then-used 10-point scoring system. At the 2003 event, Schumacher endured one of the most trying races in his career, needing to come at least eighth, he started at fourteenth on the grid – but managed to secure the point he needed to take his sixth World Drivers&#x27; Championship, beating the record held by Juan Manuel Fangio. Schumacher had an incident-filled race, having a collision with Takuma Sato and another near collision with his brother. The qualifying session for the 2004 event, which was due to be held on 9 October, was postponed until race day after a typhoon hit Suzuka. This led to the idea of holding qualifying sessions on a Sunday morning (an idea that was abandoned half-way through the following year).

The 2005 race was one of the most exciting races of the season after many top drivers started near the back of the grid after the qualifying in variable weather. McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen won the race after starting from 17th place, overtaking Renault driver Giancarlo Fisichella at the beginning of the last lap – after Fisichella was blocked by a backmarker. At the 2006 event, Michael Schumacher led until an engine failure virtually ended his chances of an eighth championship, which went to Spaniard Fernando Alonso.

====Fuji redevelopment====
It was announced on 24 March 2006 by the FIA that future races will again be held at the redesigned Fuji Speedway (now owned by Toyota) in Oyama, Sunto District, Shizuoka Prefecture. The news of the Japanese Grand Prix moving to the circuit redesigned by Hermann Tilke was met with some trepidation, as the Honda-owned Suzuka was a favorite of many of the drivers and Hermann Tilke&#x27;s tracks had received mixed reviews from the drivers and the fans.On 8 September 2007, it was announced that Fuji will alternate the Japanese Grand Prix with Suzuka, starting from 2009 onwards. The 2007 race was held in torrential rain and started behind the safety car. Lewis Hamilton took the victory while his McLaren teammate Fernando Alonso crashed heavily. Heikki Kovalainen finished 2nd, his best result until that date and Kimi Räikkönen 3rd, marking the first time that two Finnish drivers were together on the podium. In 2008, the first corner brought trouble for both the title contending McLarens and Ferraris, and Fernando Alonso was able to take the victory in a Renault. Felipe Massa was 7th after a penalty for a collision with title rival Lewis Hamilton, while Hamilton finished outside the points, having also served a penalty for an incident in the first corner.

====Return to Suzuka====
In July 2009, Toyota cited a global economic slump as the reason that the Japanese Grand Prix would not return to Fuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond. The speedway argued, according to the Associated Press, that &quot;continuing to host F1 races could threaten the survival of the company&quot;. As a result, the 2010 Grand Prix was held at Suzuka, at which point it was announced that Suzuka would have exclusive hosting duties.

Both the 2009 and 2010 races were dominated by Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel, with Red Bull finishing 1–2 both years. Sebastian Vettel secured his second World Championship in the 2011 Grand Prix with a third-place finish, while McLaren&#x27;s Jenson Button (the only driver in the field who had a theoretical chance of beating Vettel to the title) won the race wearing a special tribute helmet to the people affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The helmet featured a design in the style of the Japanese flag, and he auctioned the helmet off afterwards to raise money for those caught in unfortunate circumstances during the times of the tsunami earlier that year.
Kamui Kobayashi took third place at the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix, after enduring race-long pressure from Jenson Button. Kobayashi became the first Japanese driver to finish on a Formula One podium in Japan in 22 years, after Aguri Suzuki in the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix, and was the third Japanese driver to finish on a Formula One podium after Suzuki and Takuma Sato in the 2004 United States Grand Prix.

The 2013 race was won by Sebastian Vettel for Red Bull, marking his fourth consecutive victory of the season as well as his fourth victory overall at Suzuka. Vettel&#x27;s teammate Mark Webber, who started the race on pole position, finished second behind his teammate, with Romain Grosjean taking the final podium position for Lotus.

In 2014, a typhoon struck the circuit during the race weekend, causing controversy over the late-afternoon start time not being moved. The race saw both the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton duel with each other for the lead, with Hamilton ultimately taking victory ahead of his teammate and Sebastian Vettel. However, the race was marred by tragedy. On lap 45, Adrian Sutil in the Sauber spun off the track at the Dunlop Curve, and as his car was being recovered by a crane, Jules Bianchi in the Marussia spun off track at the same area and smashed horrifically into the crane. The race was red flagged immediately following the accident as conditions were deemed too dangerous to race. Bianchi was unresponsive to marshals and team radio. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was placed into a coma. It was hoped that he would recover, but Bianchi died nine months later due to his injuries. This led to changes to the circuit for the next year, with drainage gutters being created at the Dunlop Curve to allow water to runoff faster during a rainstorm, as well as the moving of a similar crane to prevent accidents such as Bianchi&#x27;s from occurring in the future.

On 23 August 2013 it was announced that the contract for the Japanese Grand Prix had been extended until 2018. A further extension was announced in August 2018 to keep the race at Suzuka until 2021. But the 2020 edition, due to be held on 11 October, was cancelled on 12 June due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2022 Japanese Grand Prix, held on 9 October 2022, was the first held at Suzuka since 2019. The race saw a delayed start due to torrential rain, which when the race began would lead to Carlos Sainz Jr. crashing his Ferrari and the race being red-flagged. 28 laps were run. Before the race was suspended, the FIA dispatched a recovery vehicle while the race was under double yellow flag conditions, which meant that the vehicle was on the track at the same time as the Formula One cars themselves - leading to a near-miss incident for Pierre Gasly, who at that time was driving for Scuderia AlphaTauri and had collided with an advertisement board, meaning that he had to make a quick pit stop and had to catch up to the safety car train, narrowly missing the vehicle. This was sharply criticised by drivers as Gasly&#x27;s compatriot Jules Bianchi had lost his life due to a similar incident in 2014.

This race also saw some confusion regarding the awarding of points; it was widely believed that championship leader Max Verstappen would earn half points (19 instead of 25) due to less than 75% of the scheduled race distance being completed, which would mean he was one point short of claiming the championship. However, full points were awarded instead and Verstappen became the 2022 Formula One World Champion; he himself showed surprise when he found out that full points were awarded. This confusion was a result of a rule change implemented for 2022 which was introduced in response to the rain-disrupted 2021 Belgian Grand Prix. For the 2023 season, the points-awarding system was altered to utilise the sliding scale system to determine the points being given, regardless if it finishes under red or green flag conditions.

On 5 July 2023 it was announced that the Japanese Grand Prix has been moved from its traditional September/October date as it was in previous years, to a slot in April for the 2024 calendar, between the Australian Grand Prix and the returning Chinese Grand Prix as part of F1&#x27;s regionalisation efforts.

== Popularity ==
From its return to the Formula One calendar in 1987, the Japanese Grand Prix has become one of the most popular with spectators. For the 1990 race, three million fans entered a draw for the 120,000 available tickets, due to the popularity of Honda&#x27;s world championship successes as an engine supplier to the Williams and McLaren teams, the fact that the country had produced its first full-time F1 driver in Satoru Nakajima, and Ayrton Senna&#x27;s immense popularity in Japan. After Nakajima&#x27;s retirement in and Honda&#x27;s withdrawal from competition the following year, interest went into decline despite the addition of the Pacific Grand Prix to the F1 calendar, an event also held in Japan during the and seasons. The 1995 Japanese Grand Prix was the first for which the allocated tickets did not sell out. Subsequently, the appearance of new Japanese drivers such as Takuma Sato and the entry of Honda and Toyota as full manufacturer teams has restored the event to its former popularity. However, Honda and Toyota left Formula One in 2008 and 2009 respectively, with both teams citing economic reasons. Honda returned to Formula One as an engine supplier for McLaren in 2015, a partnership that lasted until 2018. Honda began supplying engines for Toro Rosso (later known first as AlphaTauri and secondly as RB) in 2018, and Red Bull Racing in 2019, before leaving Formula One again after the 2021 season. Honda supported the development of Red Bull Powertrains engines for the 2022 season and would assist RBPT engine development for the 2023 to 2025 seasons before moving to Aston Martin as a works engine supplier following the 2026 season.
