<text>In molecular genetics, the three prime untranslated region (3′-UTR) is the section of messenger RNA (mRNA) that immediately follows the translation termination codon. The 3′-UTR often contains regulatory regions that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression.

During gene expression, an mRNA molecule is transcribed from the DNA sequence and is later translated into a protein. Several regions of the mRNA molecule are not translated into a protein including the 5&#x27; cap, 5&#x27; untranslated region, 3′ untranslated region and poly(A) tail. Regulatory regions within the 3′-untranslated region can influence polyadenylation, translation efficiency, localization, and stability of the mRNA. The 3′-UTR contains binding sites for both regulatory proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs). By binding to specific sites within the 3′-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3′-UTR also has silencer regions which bind to repressor proteins and will inhibit the expression of the mRNA.

Many 3′-UTRs also contain AU-rich elements (AREs). Proteins bind AREs to affect the stability or decay rate of transcripts in a localized manner or affect translation initiation. Furthermore, the 3′-UTR contains the sequence AAUAAA that directs addition of several hundred adenine residues called the poly(A) tail to the end of the mRNA transcript. Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) binds to this tail, contributing to regulation of mRNA translation, stability, and export. For example, poly(A) tail bound PABP interacts with proteins associated with the 5&#x27; end of the transcript, causing a circularization of the mRNA that promotes translation.

The 3′-UTR can also contain sequences that attract proteins to associate the mRNA with the cytoskeleton, transport it to or from the cell nucleus, or perform other types of localization. In addition to sequences within the 3′-UTR, the physical characteristics of the region, including its length and secondary structure, contribute to translation regulation. These diverse mechanisms of gene regulation ensure that the correct genes are expressed in the correct cells at the appropriate times.

==Physical characteristics==
The 3′-UTR of mRNA has a great variety of regulatory functions that are controlled by the physical characteristics of the region. One such characteristic is the length of the 3′-UTR, which in the mammalian genome has considerable variation. This region of the mRNA transcript can range from 60 nucleotides to about 4000. On average the length for the 3′-UTR in humans is approximately 800 nucleotides, while the average length of 5&#x27;-UTRs is only about 200 nucleotides. The length of the 3′-UTR is significant since longer 3′-UTRs are associated with lower levels of gene expression. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that longer regions have a higher probability of possessing more miRNA binding sites that have the ability to inhibit translation. In addition to length, the nucleotide composition also differs significantly between the 5&#x27; and 3′-UTR. The mean G+C percentage of the 5&#x27;-UTR in warm-blooded vertebrates is about 60% as compared to only 45% for 3′-UTRs. This is important because an inverse correlation has been observed between the G+C% of 5&#x27; and 3′-UTRs and their corresponding lengths. The UTRs that are GC-poor tend to be longer than those located in GC-rich genomic regions.

Sequences within the 3′-UTR also have the ability to degrade or stabilize the mRNA transcript. Modifications that control a transcript&#x27;s stability allow expression of a gene to be rapidly controlled without altering translation rates. One group of elements in the 3′-UTR that can help destabilize an mRNA transcript are the AU-rich elements (AREs). These elements range in size from 50 to 150 base pairs and generally contain multiple copies of the pentanucleotide AUUUA. Early studies indicated that AREs can vary in sequence and fall into three main classes that differ in the number and arrangement of motifs. Another set of elements that is present in both the 5&#x27; and 3′-UTR are iron response elements (IREs). The IRE is a stem-loop structure within the untranslated regions of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in cellular iron metabolism. The mRNA transcript containing this element is either degraded or stabilized depending upon the binding of specific proteins and the intracellular iron concentrations.
The 3′-UTR also contains sequences that signal additions to be made, either to the transcript itself or to the product of translation. For example, there are two different polyadenylation signals present within the 3′-UTR that signal the addition of the poly(A) tail. These signals initiate the synthesis of the poly(A) tail at a defined length of about 250 base pairs. The primary signal used is the nuclear polyadenylation signal (PAS) with the sequence AAUAAA located toward the end of the 3′-UTR. However, during early development cytoplasmic polyadenylation can occur instead and regulate the translational activation of maternal mRNAs. The element that controls this process is called the CPE which is AU-rich and located in the 3′-UTR as well. The CPE generally has the structure UUUUUUAU and is usually within 100 base pairs of the nuclear PAS. Another specific addition signaled by the 3′-UTR is the incorporation of selenocysteine at UGA codons of mRNAs encoding selenoproteins. Normally the UGA codon encodes for a stop of translation, but in this case a conserved stem-loop structure called the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) causes for the insertion of selenocysteine instead.

==Role in gene expression==
The 3′-untranslated region plays a crucial role in gene expression by influencing the localization, stability, export, and translation efficiency of an mRNA. It contains various sequences that are involved in gene expression, including microRNA response elements (MREs), AU-rich elements (AREs), and the poly(A) tail. In addition, the structural characteristics of the 3′-UTR as well as its use of alternative polyadenylation play a role in gene expression.

===MicroRNA response elements===
The 3′-UTR often contains microRNA response elements (MREs), which are sequences to which miRNAs bind. miRNAs are short, non-coding RNA molecules capable of binding to mRNA transcripts and regulating their expression. One miRNA mechanism involves partial base pairing of the 5&#x27; seed sequence of an miRNA to an MRE within the 3′-UTR of an mRNA; this binding then causes translational repression.

===AU-rich elements===
In addition to containing MREs, the 3′-UTR also often contains AU-rich elements (AREs), which are 50 to 150 bp in length and usually include many copies of the sequence AUUUA. ARE binding proteins (ARE-BPs) bind to AU-rich elements in a manner that is dependent upon tissue type, cell type, timing, cellular localization, and environment. In response to different intracellular and extracellular signals, ARE-BPs can promote mRNA decay, affect mRNA stability, or activate translation. This mechanism of gene regulation is involved in cell growth, cellular differentiation, and adaptation to external stimuli. It therefore acts on transcripts encoding cytokines, growth factors, tumor suppressors, proto-oncogenes, cyclins, enzymes, transcription factors, receptors, and membrane proteins.

===Poly(A) tail===

The poly(A) tail contains binding sites for poly(A) binding proteins (PABPs). These proteins cooperate with other factors to affect the export, stability, decay, and translation of an mRNA. PABPs bound to the poly(A) tail may also interact with proteins, such as translation initiation factors, that are bound to the 5&#x27; cap of the mRNA. This interaction causes circularization of the transcript, which subsequently promotes translation initiation. Furthermore, it allows for efficient translation by causing recycling of ribosomes. While the presence of a poly(A) tail usually aids in triggering translation, the absence or removal of one often leads to exonuclease-mediated degradation of the mRNA. Polyadenylation itself is regulated by sequences within the 3′-UTR of the transcript. These sequences include cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs), which are uridine-rich sequences that contribute to both polyadenylation activation and repression. CPE-binding protein (CPEB) binds to CPEs in conjunction with a variety of other proteins in order to elicit different responses.

===Structural characteristics===
While the sequence that constitutes the 3′-UTR contributes greatly to gene expression, the structural characteristics of the 3′-UTR also play a large role. In general, longer 3′-UTRs correspond to lower expression rates since they often contain more miRNA and protein binding sites that are involved in inhibiting translation. Human transcripts possess 3′-UTRs that are on average twice as long as other mammalian 3′-UTRs. This trend reflects the high level of complexity involved in human gene regulation. In addition to length, the secondary structure of the 3′-untranslated region also has regulatory functions. Protein factors can either aid or disrupt folding of the region into various secondary structures. The most common structure is a stem-loop, which provides a scaffold for RNA binding proteins and non-coding RNAs that influence expression of the transcript. 

===Alternative polyadenylation===
Another mechanism involving the structure of the 3′-UTR is called alternative polyadenylation (APA), which results in mRNA isoforms that differ only in their 3′-UTRs. This mechanism is especially useful for complex organisms as it provides a means of expressing the same protein but in varying amounts and locations. It is utilized by about half of human genes. APA can result from the presence of multiple polyadenylation sites or mutually exclusive terminal exons. Since it can affect the presence of protein and miRNA binding sites, APA can cause differential expression of mRNA transcripts by influencing their stability, export to the cytoplasm, and translation efficiency.

==Methods of study==
Scientists use a number of methods to study the complex structures and functions of the 3′ UTR. Even if a given 3′-UTR in an mRNA is shown to be present in a tissue, the effects of localization, functional half-life, translational efficiency, and trans-acting elements must be determined to understand the 3′-UTR&#x27;s full functionality. Computational approaches, primarily by sequence analysis, have shown the existence of AREs in approximately 5 to 8% of human 3′-UTRs and the presence of one or more miRNA targets in as many as 60% or more of human 3′-UTRs. Software can rapidly compare millions of sequences at once to find similarities between various 3′ UTRs within the genome. Experimental approaches have been used to define sequences that associate with specific RNA-binding proteins; specifically, recent improvements in sequencing and cross-linking techniques have enabled fine mapping of protein binding sites within the transcript. Induced site-specific mutations, for example those that affect the termination codon, polyadenylation signal, or secondary structure of the 3′-UTR, can show how mutated regions can cause translation deregulation and disease. These types of transcript-wide methods should help our understanding of known cis elements and trans-regulatory factors within 3′-UTRs.

==Disease==

3′-UTR mutations can be very consequential because one alteration can be responsible for the altered expression of many genes. Transcriptionally, a mutation may affect only the allele and genes that are physically linked. However, since 3′-UTR binding proteins also function in the processing and nuclear export of mRNA, a mutation can also affect other unrelated genes. Dysregulation of ARE-binding proteins (AUBPs) due to mutations in AU-rich regions can lead to diseases including tumorigenesis (cancer), hematopoietic malignancies, leukemogenesis, and developmental delay/autism spectrum disorders. An expanded number of trinucleotide (CTG) repeats in the 3’-UTR of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene causes myotonic dystrophy. Retro-transposal 3-kilobase insertion of tandem repeat sequences within the 3′-UTR of fukutin protein is linked to Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy. Elements in the 3′-UTR have also been linked to human acute myeloid leukemia, alpha-thalassemia, neuroblastoma, Keratinopathy, Aniridia, IPEX syndrome, and congenital heart defects. The few UTR-mediated diseases identified only hint at the countless links yet to be discovered.

==Future development==
Despite current understanding of 3′-UTRs, they are still relative mysteries. Since mRNAs usually contain several overlapping control elements, it is often difficult to specify the identity and function of each 3′-UTR element, let alone the regulatory factors that may bind at these sites. Additionally, each 3′-UTR contains many alternative AU-rich elements and polyadenylation signals. These cis- and trans-acting elements, along with miRNAs, offer a virtually limitless range of control possibilities within a single mRNA. Future research through the increased use of deep-sequencing based ribosome profiling will reveal more regulatory subtleties as well as new control elements and AUBPs.

<text>The Missionaries of Charity () is a Catholic centralised religious institute of consecrated life of Pontifical Right for women
established in 1950 by Mother Teresa, now known in the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. , it consisted of 5,750 members of religious sisters. Members of the order designate their affiliation using the order&#x27;s initials, &quot;M.C.&quot;. A member of the congregation must adhere to the vows of chastity, poverty, obedience, and the fourth vow, to give &quot;wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.&quot; Today, the order consists of both contemplative and active branches in several countries.

Missionaries care for those who include refugees, former prostitutes, the mentally ill, sick children, abandoned children, lepers, people with AIDS, the aged, and convalescent. They have schools that are run by volunteers to teach abandoned street children and run soup kitchens as well as other services according to the community needs. These services are provided, without charge, to people regardless of their religion or social status.

==History==

On October 7, 1950, Mother Teresa and the small community formed by her former pupils was labelled as the &quot;Diocesan Congregation of the Calcutta Diocese&quot;, and thus received the permission from the Diocese of Calcutta to identify as a Catholic organization. Their mission was to care for (in Mother Teresa&#x27;s words) &quot;the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone.&quot; It began as a small community with 12 members in Calcutta (now Kolkata), and in 2023 had 5,750 members serving in 139 countries in 760 homes, with 244 of these homes in India. The sisters run orphanages, homes for those dying of AIDS, charity centres worldwide and care for refugees, the blind, disabled, aged, alcoholics, the poor, homeless and also victims of natural disasters, epidemics, famine in Asia, Africa, Latin America, North America, Europe and Australia. They have 19 homes in Kolkata (Calcutta) alone which include homes for women, orphaned children and homes for the dying; a school for street children, and a leper colony.

In 1963, Brother Andrew (formerly Ian Travers-Ballan) founded the Missionary Brothers of Charity in Australia along with Mother Teresa.

In 1965, by granting a Decree of Praise, Pope Paul VI granted Mother Teresa&#x27;s request to expand her congregation to other countries. The Congregation started to grow rapidly, with new homes opening all over the globe. The congregation&#x27;s first house outside India was in Venezuela, others followed in Rome and Tanzania and worldwide.

In 1979 the contemplative branch of the Brothers was added and in 1984 a priest branch, the Missionaries of Charity Fathers, was founded by Mother Teresa with Fr. Joseph Langford, combining the vocation of the Missionaries of Charity with the Ministerial Priesthood. As with the Sisters, the Fathers live a very simple lifestyle without television, radios or items of convenience. They neither smoke nor drink alcohol and beg for their food. They make a visit to their families every five years but do not take annual holidays. Lay Catholics and non-Catholics constitute the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa, the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, and the Lay Missionaries of Charity.

The first home of the Missionaries of Charity in the United States was established in the South Bronx, New York, where in 2019 they had convents for both their active and contemplative branches, and had placed 108 sisters in their province that stretches from Quebec to Washington, DC. Their first rural mission in the United States, in 1982, was in one of the poorest, former coal mining areas of Kentucky, where they still serve. In the US, the Missionaries of Charity are affiliated with the Council of Major Superiors of Women Religious, a body of female religious, representing 20% of American religious sisters. They are identified by the wearing of religious habits, and loyalty to church teaching. By 1996, the organisation was operating 517 missions in more than 100 countries.

In 1990, Mother Teresa asked to resign as head of the Missionaries but was soon voted back in as Superior General. On March 13, 1997, six months before Mother Teresa&#x27;s death, Sister Mary Nirmala Joshi was elected the new Superior General of the Missionaries of Charity. In April 2009, Sister Mary Prema was elected to succeed Sister Nirmala, during a general chapter held in Kolkata.

The quality of care offered to terminally ill patients in the Home for the Dying in Calcutta was the subject of discussion in the mid-1990s. Some British observers, on the basis of short visits, drew unfavourable comparisons with the standard of care available in hospices in the United Kingdom. Remarks made by Dr. Robin Fox relative to the lack of full-time medically trained personnel and the absence of strong analgesics were published in a brief memoir in an issue of &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1994. These remarks were criticised in a later issue of &quot;The Lancet&quot; on the ground that they failed to take account of Indian conditions, specifically the fact that government regulations effectively precluded the use of morphine outside large hospitals.

In Phoenix, Arizona, the sisters&#x27; accommodation for 40 homeless men is funded by a clothier, featured in Vogue, who grew up within a few blocks of Mother Teresa&#x27;s original home for the dying destitute in Kalighat, Calcutta.

Princess Diana, who was very close to Mother Teresa, wrote that she found in her &quot;the direction I&#x27;ve been searching for all these years&quot;.

The Missionaries of Charity sisters were particularly hard hit by the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19, as in places they continued to distribute food and minister to the poor who had been affected.

In April 2022, Sister Mary Joseph was elected to succeed Sister Mary Prema as superior general of the order, with Sister Mary Christie elected as assistant superior general.

===Violence against missionaries===
In July 1998 in Al Hudaydah, Yemen, three Missionaries of Charity, two Indians and a Filipina, were shot and killed as they left a hospital.

In March 2016 in Aden, Yemen, sixteen people were shot and killed in a home for the elderly operated by the Missionaries of Charity. Among the dead were four missionary sisters: Sisters Marguerite and Reginette from Rwanda, Sister Anselm from India and Sister Judit from Kenya. According to Bishop Paul Hinder of the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia, their superior escaped harm by hiding. Bishop Hinder described the attack as &quot;religiously-motivated&quot;. A Salesian Syro-Malabar priest who was living at the facility, Fr. Tom Uzhunnalil of Bangalore, India, was taken prisoner by the attackers.

On Good Friday, March 25, 2016, several media outlets reported that Fr. Tom Uzhunnalil had been crucified by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. However, Bishop Hinder indicated he had strong indications that the priest was alive and still being held by his captors. In early September 2017 Fr. Uzhunnalil was rescued after 18 months in captivity, and first sent to the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis.

==Becoming a Missionary of Charity==
It takes nine years to become a full-fledged Missionary of Charity. An initial short-term &quot;come-and-see&quot; period is available. Those considered possible candidates by the Congregation may enter Aspirancy, focused on learning English (which is the community language) for those who are not from English-speaking countries and religious studies. It is followed by Postulancy (introduction into the study of Scripture, the Constitutions of the Society, Church history, and theology). If found suitable, they enter the Novitiate, the beginning of the religious life. Novices wear white cotton habits with a girdle, and white saris without the three blue stripes. In the first year (called canonical), they undertake more religious study and learn about life as a Missionary of Charity, the second year is more focused on practical training for the mission life. After two years, they take temporary vows for one year, which are renewed annually, for five years in total. They also receive a metal crucifix and a sari whose three blue stripes stand for their vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. In the sixth year, they travel to Rome, Kolkata or Washington D.C. for &quot;Tertianship&quot;, further religious study, at the end of which they make their final profession.

===Material goods===
A sister&#x27;s few possessions include: three saris (one to wear, one to wash, one to mend), two or three cotton habits, a girdle, a pair of sandals, a crucifix, and a rosary. They also have a plate, a set of cutlery, a cloth napkin, a canvas bag, and a prayer book. In cold countries, sisters may own a cardigan and other articles suited to the local climate such as a coat, scarf, and closed shoes.

==Controversies==


A British former volunteer at the Home, Robin Fox (now editor of the British medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;) disclosed in 1994 that syringes were rinsed in cold water and reused; that inmates were given cold baths; and that aspirin was administered to people with terminal cancer. Fox also noted, however, that the residents were &quot;eating heartily and doing well&quot;, and that the sisters and volunteers focused on cleanliness, tending wounds and sores, and providing loving kindness. The controversy remains due to the use of unsterilized needles and the failure to make proper diagnoses, as put by Dr. Jack Preger: &quot;If one wants to give love, understanding and care, one uses sterile needles.&quot;

In 2018, all child care homes in India run by the Missionaries of Charity were inspected by the Indian Ministry of Women and Child Development following allegations that two staff members at a Jharkhand home sold babies for adoption. A sister (Konsaila Balsa) and a social worker (Anima Indwar) employed there were arrested. They were accused of having already sold three babies from the home, which provides shelter for pregnant, unmarried women, and of trying to sell a baby boy for roughly £1,325. The Missionaries of Charity had discontinued its participation in adoption services in India three years earlier over religious objections to the country&#x27;s new adoption rules. In December 2021, India&#x27;s Ministry of Home Affairs headed by former BJP national president Amit Shah refused to renew the registration under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act of Missionaries of Charity along with 6000 other charity organizations, which is mandatory for charities, NGOs and any non-profit organizations receiving foreign funding in India registration over allegations of the organization aiding in conversion of Hindus to Catholicism (an allegation which has also been levelled against Teresa too). However the decision was subsequently reverted in the first week of January 2022.

<text>The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts is the only building designed primarily by Le Corbusier in the United States—he contributed to the design of the United Nations Secretariat Building—and one of only two in the Americas (the other being the Curutchet House in La Plata, Argentina). Le Corbusier designed it with the collaboration of Chilean architect Guillermo Jullian de la Fuente at his 35 rue de Sèvres studio; the on-site preparation of the construction plans was handled by the office of Josep Lluís Sert, then dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He had formerly worked in Le Corbusier&#x27;s atelier and had been instrumental in winning him the commission. The building was completed in 1962.

== Commission ==
During the mid-1950s, the idea of creating a place for the visual arts at Harvard began to take shape. A new department dedicated to the visual arts was created, and the need for a building to house the new department arose. A budget was set for $1.3 million, and the proposal was included in a Harvard fundraising program. The project immediately elicited a response from Harvard alumnus Alfred St. Vrain Carpenter and his wife Helen Bundy Carpenter. The couple, whose son Harlow had just attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design, donated $1.5 million for the proposed design center. The donation propelled the project forward, and the Committee for the Practice of Visual Arts began to look for an architect to undertake the project. Originally, the committee had recommended that the building be designed by &quot;a first rate American architect&quot; who would be in the company of Charles Bulfinch and Walter Gropius, among others. However, José Luis Sert, who was at the time Dean of the Graduate School of Design and chairman of the committee suggested that his friend and previous collaborator, Le Corbusier, be asked to design the building. Delayed due to scheduling and payment conflicts, Le Corbusier eventually accepted and made his first of two visits to Cambridge in 1959.

== Design and construction ==
Because the Carpenter Center was to be his only building in America, Le Corbusier felt it should be a synthesis of his architectural principles and therefore incorporated his Five Points into its design. He took it as a particular challenge, determined that it should make a positive impact both on its surroundings—Georgian style houses—and in its mode of operation. He proposed to take pedestrians from all parts of the campus through the building, so that even though they might not be intending to visit it, they would see and thus partake in the artistic activities going on within it.

After much debate, a site was chosen between Quincy and Prescott Streets, abiding by the original proposal for the building. The allotted space was quite small, so the completed building presents itself as a compact, roughly cylindrical mass bisected by an S-shaped ramp on the third floor. Le Corbusier&#x27;s earliest design showed a much more pronounced ramp that further separated the two parts of the central mass. However, the early design created the problem of too much disruption of the central mass. This problem auditorium reconciled by using a pinwheel effect so that in the finally executed design, the two halves meet at a vertical core that houses an elevator. The concrete ramp is cantilevered from this central spine and stands atop a few pilotis. The landing at the top of the ramp is located in the core of the building and leads to various studios and exhibition spaces seen through glass windows and doors, providing views into the building&#x27;s instructional and displaying functions without interrupting the activities in progress.

The exterior of the Carpenter Center presents itself very differently from different angles. From Prescott Street looking toward the curved studio space, one can see the brise-soleil that are placed perpendicular to the direction of the central portion of the ramp, making only their narrow ends visible from the street. The Quincy Street view, however, reveals ondulatoires on this studio&#x27;s exterior curve, which interfere with the building&#x27;s curve less than the brise-soleil do on the opposite side. On the ramp from Quincy street just before entering the building, one sees grids of square and rectangles of the windows, brise-soleils, and studio spaces, rather than the curves of the two halves of the building.

== Later history ==
The building now houses the Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies (formerly Visual and Environmental Studies) of the university, and is the venue for screenings by the Harvard Film Archive.

Le Corbusier never actually saw the building. He was invited to the opening ceremony, but he declined the invitation on account of his poor health.

The French artist Pierre Huyghe explored the creation of the building in his 2004 work &quot;This Is Not A Time For Dreaming&quot;.

<doc id="345927" wikidata="Q7104139" url="?curid=345927" title="Orsinian Tales">
<text>Orsinian Tales is a collection of eleven short stories by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, most of them set in the imaginary Eastern European country of Orsinia.

==Themes==
The stories share few links except those derived from the use of a common geographical setting; the only link between characters appears in the stories &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; and &quot;A Week in the Country&quot;, both of which deal with members of the Fabbre family (whose history is continued in the later story &quot;Unlocking the Air&quot;). Common to all the stories, however, are emotionally moving personal events—often, though not always, romantic—set against the backdrop of much larger political events such as wars and revolutions. Continually reasserted are the right of the individual—sometimes alone, but often in conjunction with others—to his or her own thoughts and emotions, not dictated by society, or convention, or the State.

==Continuations==
Additional stories in the cycle include the novel &quot;Malafrena&quot; (1979), set in the Orsinia of the 1820s; the Borges-like story &quot;Two Delays on the Northern Line&quot; containing two tangentially linked episodes of uncertain date; and &quot;Unlocking the Air&quot;
The last-named story extends Orsinian history to the time of the downfall of Communism in Orsinia – and the rest of Eastern Europe – in the winter of 1989.

==Orsinia==
The stories are set in a fictional country somewhere in Central Europe, at different times in the period 1150–1989 (though only two take place before the 20th century). This country, &quot;Orsinia&quot;, appears in Le Guin&#x27;s earliest writings, and was invented by le Guin when she was a young adult learning her craft as a writer. The names &quot;Orsinia&quot; and &quot;Ursula&quot; are both derived from Latin &quot;ursus&quot; &quot;bear&quot; (&quot;ursula&quot; = diminutive of &quot;ursa&quot; &quot;female bear&quot;; &quot;ursinus&quot; = &quot;bear-like&quot;). Le Guin once said that since Orsinia was her own country it should bear her name.

The history of Orsinia follows, in general, that of other countries of Central Europe, particularly those formerly part of Austria-Hungary. Formerly an independent kingdom (&quot;The Lady of Moge&quot;), by the 19th century it was a dependency of the Austrian Empire (&quot;Malafrena&quot;). It was involved in the First World War (&quot;Conversations at Night&quot;), and was thereafter independent for a while. Its fate in World War II is not mentioned, but in 1946 or 1947 it became a satellite state in the East bloc. A revolt was attempted in 1956 (&quot;The Road East&quot;), but was crushed and followed by reprisals (&quot;A Week in the Country&quot;), and Orsinia remained a repressive police state for several decades. In November 1989, following a series of non-violent protests, the government fell, to be replaced by a transitional régime promising free elections (&quot;Unlocking the Air&quot;). Le Guin did not publish any Orsinian stories dealing with its history since.

The Orsinian stories borrow episodes from, and sometimes explicitly refer to, the history of the Czech lands, as well as Hungary and other countries of Central Europe
It is not however, a mere fictionalization of any real country, but rather one imagined with its own unique characteristics and history, distilled from le Guin&#x27;s personal interpretation and reaction to historical events.

<text>In biology, the SECIS element (SECIS: &quot;selenocysteine insertion sequence&quot;) is an RNA element around 60 nucleotides in length that adopts a stem-loop structure. This structural motif (pattern of nucleotides) directs the cell to translate UGA codons as selenocysteines (UGA is normally a stop codon). SECIS elements are thus a fundamental aspect of messenger RNAs encoding selenoproteins, proteins that include one or more selenocysteine residues.

In bacteria the SECIS element appears soon after the UGA codon it affects. In archaea and eukaryotes, it occurs in the 3&#x27; UTR of an mRNA, and can cause multiple UGA codons within the mRNA to code for selenocysteine. One archaeal SECIS element, in &quot;Methanococcus,&quot; is located in the 5&#x27; UTR.

The SECIS element appears defined by sequence characteristics, i.e. particular nucleotides tend to be at particular positions in it, and a characteristic secondary structure. The secondary structure is the result of base-pairing of complementary RNA nucleotides, and causes a hairpin-like structure. The eukaryotic SECIS element includes non-canonical A-G base pairs, which are uncommon in nature, but are critically important for correct SECIS element function. Although the eukaryotic, archaeal and bacterial SECIS elements each share a general hairpin structure, they are not alignable, e.g. an alignment-based scheme to recognize eukaryotic SECIS elements will not be able to recognize archaeal SECIS elements. However, in Lokiarcheota, SECIS elements are more similar to eukaryotic elements.

In bioinformatics, several computer programs have been created that search for SECIS elements within a genome sequence, based on the sequence and secondary structure characteristics of SECIS elements. These programs have been used in searches for novel selenoproteins.

==Species distribution==
The SECIS element is found in a wide variety of organisms from all three domains of life (including their viruses).

<doc id="345931" wikidata="Q2745644" url="?curid=345931" title="Selenoprotein">
<text>In molecular biology a selenoprotein is any protein that includes a selenocysteine (Sec, U, Se-Cys) amino acid residue. Among functionally characterized selenoproteins are five glutathione peroxidases (GPX) and three thioredoxin reductases, (TrxR/TXNRD) which both contain only one Sec. Selenoprotein P is the most common selenoprotein found in the plasma. It is unusual because in humans it contains 10 Sec residues, which are split into two domains, a longer N-terminal domain that contains 1 Sec, and a shorter C-terminal domain that contains 9 Sec. The longer N-terminal domain is likely an enzymatic domain, and the shorter C-terminal domain is likely a means of safely transporting the very reactive selenium atom throughout the body.

== Species distribution ==

&quot;Selenoproteins&quot; exist in all major domains of life, eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea. Among eukaryotes, selenoproteins appear to be common in animals, but rare or absent in other phyla—one has been identified in the green alga &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot;, but almost none in other plants or in fungi. The American cranberry (&quot;Vaccinium macrocarpon&quot; Ait.) is the only land plant known to possess sequence-level machinery for producing selenocysteine in its mitochondrial genome, although its level of functionality is not yet determined. Among bacteria and archaea, selenoproteins are only present in some lineages, while they are completely absent in many other phylogenetic groups. These observations have now been confirmed by whole genome analysis, which shows the presence or absence of selenoprotein genes and accessory genes for the synthesis of selenoproteins in the respective organism.

== Types ==

Besides the selenocysteine-containing selenoproteins, there are also some selenoproteins known from bacterial species, which have selenium bound noncovalently. Most of these proteins are thought to contain a selenide-ligand to a molybdopterin cofactor at their active sites (e.g. nicotinate dehydrogenase of &quot;Eubacterium barkeri&quot;, or xanthine dehydrogenases). Selenium is also specifically incorporated into modified bases of some tRNAs (as 2-seleno-5-methylaminomethyl-uridine).

In addition, selenium occurs in proteins as unspecifically incorporated selenomethionine, which replaces methionine residues. Proteins containing such unspecifically incorporated selenomethionine residues are not regarded as selenoproteins. However, replacement of all methionines by selenomethionines is a widely used, recent technique in solving the phase problem during X-ray crystallographic structure determination of many proteins (MAD-phasing). While the exchange of methionines by selenomethionines appears to be tolerated (at least in bacterial cells), unspecific incorporation of selenocysteine in lieu of cysteine seems to be highly toxic. This may be one reason for the existence of a rather complicated pathway of selenocysteine biosynthesis and specific incorporation into selenoproteins, which avoids the occurrence of the free amino acid as intermediate. Thus, even if a selenocysteine-containing selenoprotein is taken up in the diet and used as selenium source, the amino acid must be degraded prior to synthesising a new selenocysteine for incorporation into a selenoprotein.

== Clinical significance ==

Selenium is a vital nutrient in animals, including humans. About 25 different selenocysteine-containing selenoproteins have so far been observed in human cells and tissues. Since lack of selenium deprives the cell of its ability to synthesize selenoproteins, many health effects of low selenium intake are believed to be caused by the lack of one or more specific selenoproteins. Three selenoproteins, TXNRD1 (TR1), TXNRD2 (TR3) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), have been shown to be essential in mouse knockout experiments. On the other hand, too much dietary selenium causes toxic effects and can lead to selenium poisoning. The threshold between essential and toxic concentrations of this element is rather narrow with a factor in the range of 10-100.

Mutations in Selenoprotein N (SELENON, formerly SEPN1) in humans cause a subtype of congenital muscular dystrophy known as SELENON-related myopathy.

== Examples ==

Human selenoproteins include:

* Iodothyronine deiodinases 1-3: DIO1, DIO2, DIO3
* Glutathione peroxidases: GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4, GPX6
* Selenoproteins: SelH (C11orf31), SelI (EPT1), SelK, SelM, SelN (SEPN1), SelO, SelP (SEPP1), SelR (MSRB1), SelS, SelT, SelV, SelW (SEPW1), Sel15
* Selenophosphate synthetase 2 (SEPHS2, SPS2)
* Thioredoxin reductases 1-3: TXNRD1, TXNRD2, TXNRD3
Bacterial selenoproteins include:

* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;: FdhH-, FdhN- &amp; FdhO-complex

<doc id="345937" wikidata="Q632285" url="?curid=345937" title="Database schema">
<text>The database schema is the structure of a database described in a formal language supported typically by a relational database management system (RDBMS). The term &quot;&quot; refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases). The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of the database language. The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, the database schema. This describes how real-world entities are modeled in the database.

&quot;A database schema specifies, based on the database administrator&#x27;s knowledge of possible applications, the facts that can enter the database, or those of interest to the possible end-users.&quot; The notion of a database schema plays the same role as the notion of theory in predicate calculus. A model of this &quot;theory&quot; closely corresponds to a database, which can be seen at any instant of time as a mathematical object. Thus a schema can contain formulas representing integrity constraints specifically for an application and the constraints specifically for a type of database, all expressed in the same database language. In a relational database, the schema defines the tables, fields, relationships, views, indexes, packages, procedures, functions, queues, triggers, types, sequences, materialized views, synonyms, database links, directories, XML schemas, and other elements.

A database generally stores its schema in a data dictionary. Although a schema is defined in text database language, the term is often used to refer to a graphical depiction of the database structure. In other words, schema is the structure of the database that defines the objects in the database.

In an Oracle Database system, the term &quot;schema&quot; has a slightly different connotation.

==Ideal requirements for schema integration==
The requirements listed below influence the detailed structure of schemas that are produced. Certain applications will not require that all of these conditions are met, but these four requirements are the most ideal.

; Overlap preservation
: Each of the overlapping elements specified in the input mapping is also in a database schema relation.

; Extended overlap preservation
: Source-specific elements that are associated with a source’s overlapping elements are passed through to the database schema.

; Normalization
: Independent entities and relationships in the source data should not be grouped together in the same relation in the database schema. In particular, source specific schema elements should not be grouped with overlapping schema elements, if the grouping co-locates independent entities or relationships.

; Minimality
: If any elements of the database schema are dropped then the database schema is not ideal.

==Example of two schema integrations==
Suppose we want a mediated schema to integrate two travel databases, Go-travel and Ok-flight.

codice_1 has two relations:

Go-flight(flight-number, time, meal(yes/no))
Go-price(flight-number, date, price)
codice_2 has just one relation:

Ok-flight(flight-number, date, time, price, nonstop(yes/no))
The overlapping information in Go-travel’s and Ok-flight’s schemas could be represented in a mediated schema:

Flight(flight-number, date, time, price)
==Oracle database specificity==
In the context of Oracle Databases, a schema object is a logical data storage structure.

An Oracle database associates a separate schema with each database user.
A schema comprises a collection of schema objects. Examples of schema objects include:

* tables
* views
* sequences
* synonyms
* indexes
* clusters
* database links
* snapshots
* procedures
* functions
* packages

On the other hand, non-schema objects may include:

* users
* roles
* contexts
* directory objects

Schema objects do not have a one-to-one correspondence to physical files on disk that store their information. However, Oracle databases store schema objects logically within a tablespace of the database. The data of each object is physically contained in one or more of the tablespace&#x27;s datafiles. For some objects (such as tables, indexes, and clusters) a database administrator can specify how much disk space the Oracle RDBMS allocates for the object within the tablespace&#x27;s datafiles.

There is no necessary relationship between schemas and tablespaces: a tablespace can contain objects from different schemas, and the objects for a single schema can reside in different tablespaces. Oracle database specificity does, however, enforce platform recognition of nonhomogenized sequence differentials, which is considered a crucial limiting factor in virtualized applications.

== Microsoft SQL Server ==
In Microsoft SQL Server, the default schema of every database is the dbo schema.

<text>The chasers, darters, skimmers, and perchers and their relatives form the Libellulidae, the largest family of dragonflies. It is sometimes considered to contain the Corduliidae as the subfamily Corduliinae and the Macromiidae as the subfamily Macromiinae. Even if these are excluded (as Silsby does), there remains a family of over 1000 species. With nearly worldwide distribution, these are the most commonly encountered dragonflies.

The genus &quot;Libellula&quot; is mostly New World but also has one of the few endangered odonates from Japan: &quot;Libellula angelina&quot;. Many of the members of this genus are brightly colored or have banded wings. The related genus &quot;Plathemis&quot; includes the whitetails. The genus &quot;Celithemis&quot; contains several brightly marked species in the southern United States. Members of the genus &quot;Sympetrum&quot; are called darters (or meadowhawks in North America) and are found throughout most of the world, except Australia. Several tropical species in the genera &quot;Trithemis&quot; and &quot;Zenithoptera&quot; are considered to be especially beautiful. Other common genera include &quot;Tramea&quot; and &quot;Pantala&quot;.

Libellulids have stout-bodied larvae with the lower lip or labium developed into a mask over the lower part of the face.

==Etymology==
The family name may have been derived from the Latin &quot;libella&quot; which means &quot;booklet&quot;.

<doc id="345939" wikidata="Q357151" url="?curid=345939" title="Emeric Thököly">
<text>Emeric Thököly de Késmárk (; ; ; ; 25 September 1657 13 September 1705) was a Hungarian nobleman, leader of anti-Habsburg uprisings like his father, Count István Thököly, before him. Emeric was Prince of Upper Hungary, an Ottoman vassal state, from 1682 to 1685, and briefly Prince of Transylvania during the year 1690. Having formed an alliance with the Turks, Thököly assisted the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and led the Turkish cavalry at the Battle of Zenta in 1697. Refusing to surrender to Habsburg Emperor Leopold I, Thököly lost his principality of Upper Hungary and finally retired to Galata, near Constantinople, with large estates granted him by Mustafa II.

== Early life ==

Emeric was born in Késmárk in Royal Hungary (now Kežmarok in Slovakia) on 25 September 1657 as the fifth son of Count István Thököly and Mária Gyulaffy. His father was one of the wealthiest aristocrats in Upper Hungary (in present-day Slovakia); his mother was the granddaughter of Stephen Bethlen, who had been prince of Transylvania in 1630, she was related to three princes of Transylvania. Being his parents&#x27; only son to survive childhood, Emeric inherited when he was still a child his mother&#x27;s estates in the Principality of Transylvania in 1659. His uncle, Count Francis Rhédey, Prince of Transylvania who died in 1667, also bequeathed his domains in Máramaros County to Emeric. A significant part of Emeric&#x27;s inherited lands were located in Máramaros County. István Thököly persuaded Michael I Apafi, Prince of Transylvania, to make Emeric the &quot;ispán&quot; (or head) of the county in 1667. Actually, Apafi&#x27;s influential counselor, Mihály Teleki, administered Máramaros on behalf of the minor &quot;ispán&quot;.

Emeric started his formal studies at the Lutheran lyceum in Eperjes (now Prešov in Slovakia) in January 1668. Being an intelligent student, he quickly understood the main aspects of Lutheran theology and learnt to write long texts in perfect Latin. He played the role of the king of Hungary in a drama presented at the school in October 1669.

István Thököly was accused of participating in the leading aristocrats&#x27; conspiracy against the Habsburg monarch, Leopold I, in 1670. Being concerned about his son&#x27;s safety, he ordered Emeric to return to Késmárk. They soon moved to Árva Castle (now Orava Castle in Slovakia), which stood near the border of Hungary and Poland. The king&#x27;s troops laid siege to the fortress and István Thököly died during the siege on 4 December. According to one version of the story of the siege, Emeric escaped from the fortress through a tunnel after his father died and fled first to Poland, then to Transylvania. Other sources say that his father had sent Emeric to Likava Castle before the siege of Árva began, and he fled to Transylvania after learning of his father&#x27;s death.

== In exile ==

Leopold I&#x27;s soldiers suppressed all resistance in Royal Hungary. Hundreds of noblemen were dispossessed of their estates; foreign mercenaries replaced the Hungarian troops in the fortresses and started plundering the nearby towns and villages. Leopold I did not respect the fundamental laws of the kingdom and appointed a Directorium to administer Hungary in 1673, led by Johann Caspar von Ampringen, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. The new government pursued a violent anti-Protestant policy and dozens of Protestant pastors were sentenced to slavery. The persecuted Hungariansexpelled noblemen, ousted soldiers and fugitive serfssought refuge in Ottoman Hungary and the Partium. The refugees, who were called &quot;kuruc&quot;, made frequent raids against the borderlands of Royal Hungary.

Emeric&#x27;s patrimony was confiscated, but he remained a wealthy man because he retained his Transylvanian estates. He accepted Mihály Teleki&#x27;s advice and continued his studies at the Reformed college of Nagyenyed (now Aiud in Romania). Contemporaneous diaries evidence that the handsome young count easily enchanted both men and women.

The envoys of Louis XIV of France and Apafi signed a treaty in Warsaw in May 1677. The French promised to send an annual subsidy to the Kuruc to finance their fight against the Habsburgs. Apafi did not declare war on Leopold I, but promised to secure the professional command of the Kuruc troops and to provide asylum to them in case of defeats. Emeric soon started to urge Apafi to allow him to join the refugees. Louis XIV&#x27;s envoy, Abbé Dominique Révérend, who met with Imre around that time, described him as &quot;the most powerful lord and the most honest man in Hungary&quot;. The princely council appointed Emeric to command the Kuruc army on 26 September. Apafi also authorized him to raise volunteer troops in Transylvania.

== Uprising ==

Emeric and the Transylvanian volunteers joined the Kuruc at Derecske on 27 November 1677. His revenues from his Transylvanian estates enabled him to improve the equipment of the army. According to a new French–Transylvanian treaty, Mihály Teleki was installed as the supreme commander of the Kuruc army on 16 February 1678, but Teleki&#x27;s appointment did not affect Emeric&#x27;s actual leadership. The Kuruc and Transylvanian troops assembled near Tasnád (now Tășnad in Romania), before they invaded Royal Hungary in June. Emeric captured the fortresses of Szendrő and Murány in early August.

Teleki and the Transylvanian army attacked Eperjes, but they abandoned the siege as soon as they were informed of the arrival of a relieving army in the middle of the month. Emeric continued the invasion with the support of local Slovak peasants. He captured Igló and Rózsahegy (now Spišská Nová Ves and Ružomberok in Slovakia), and the mining towns along the river Garam (Hron). Besztercebánya (now Banská Bystrica in Slovakia) surrendered without resistance on 10 October. Although he had to abandon the mining towns after he was defeated at Barsszentkereszt (now Žiar nad Hronom in Slovakia) on 1 November, he continued to control 13 counties in Royal Hungary.

Encouraged by promises of help from Louis XIV of France, the anti-Habsburg rebels now rose &quot;pro libertate et justitia&quot;, and chose the youthful Thököly as their leader. The war began in 1678. Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and central Hungarian mining towns were soon in Thököly&#x27;s possession. In 1681, reinforced by 10,000 Transylvanians and a Turkish army under the Pasha of Nagyvárad (today Oradea, Romania), he compelled the Emperor to grant an armistice. In June 1682 he married Croatian countess Jelena Zrinska (in Hungarian: Zrínyi Ilona), the widow of Prince Francis I Rákóczi.

Thököly&#x27;s distrust of the Emperor now induced him to turn for help to Sultan Mehmed IV, who gave him the title &quot;King of Upper Hungary&quot; (&quot;Ķıralı Orta Macar&quot;) – partly coinciding with present-day Slovakia – on condition that he pay an annual tribute of 40,000 tallers. In the course of the same year Thököly captured fortress after fortress from the Emperor and extended his dominions to the Vág (Slovak: Váh) river. At the two Diets held by him, at Kassa (today &quot;Košice&quot;, Slovakia) and Tállya, in 1683, the estates, though not uninfluenced by his personal charm, showed some want of confidence in him, fearing he might sacrifice national independence to the Turkish alliance. They refused therefore to grant him either subsidies or a levy en masse, and he had to take what he wanted by force.

== Alliance with the Ottoman Empire ==

Thököly materially assisted the Turks in the Battle of Vienna in 1683, and shared the fate of the gigantic Turkish army. The Turkish Grand Vizier nevertheless laid the blame for the Turkish defeat in Vienna on Thököly, who thereupon hastened to Edirne to defend himself before the Turkish sultan. Shortly afterwards, perceiving that the Turkish cause was now lost, he sought the mediation of Polish king John III Sobieski to reconcile him with the Emperor, offering to lay down his arms if the Emperor would confirm the religious rights of the Protestants in Hungary and grant him, Thököly, Upper Hungary (more exactly, 13 northeastern counties of Royal Hungary) with the title of prince. Leopold refused these terms and demanded an unconditional surrender. Thököly then renewed the war. However, the campaign of 1685 was a series of disasters, he was defeated at Prešov (Eperjes) and when he sought help from the Turks at Nagyvárad they seized him and sent him in chains to Edirne (possibly because of his previous negotiations with Leopold), whereupon most of his followers made their peace with the Emperor.

In 1686 Thököly was released from his dungeon and sent with a small army into Transylvania, but both this expedition and a similar one in 1688 ended in failure. The Turks then again grew suspicious of him and imprisoned him a second time. In 1690, however, they dispatched him into Transylvania a third time with 16,000 men, and in September he routed the united forces of Gen. Donat Heissler and Count Mihály Teleki at Zărneşti. After this great victory Thököly was elected prince of Transylvania by the Kereszténysziget (probably Oprişani now) Diet, but could not maintain his position for long against the imperial armies. In 1691 he quit Transylvania altogether. He led the Turkish cavalry at the Battle of Slankamen and served valiantly but vainly against Austria during the remainder of the war, especially distinguishing himself at the Battle of Zenta (1697).

He was excluded by name from the amnesty promised to the Hungarian rebels by the Treaty of Karlowitz (26 January 1699). After one more unsuccessful attempt, in 1700, to recover the principality, he settled down at Galata with his wife. From Sultan Mustafa II he received large estates and the title of count of Widdin. He died in 1705 in İzmit. He is buried in Kežmarok in the mausoleum of the so-called new church.

==Legacy==
His statue is part of Heroes&#x27; Square in Budapest, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
For his 300th death anniversary, his name was given to a street in İzmit. A memorial dedicated to him and his wife is also present in a park in İzmit.

<text>The King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR) was a British Colonial Auxiliary Forces regiment raised from Britain&#x27;s East African colonies in 1902. It primarily carried out internal security duties within these colonies along with military service elsewhere during the world wars and other conflicts, such as the Malayan Emergency and the Mau Mau uprising. The regiment&#x27;s enlisted soldiers were drawn from the native Africans, while most officers were seconded from the British Army. During the 1960s, as part of the decolonisation of Africa, more African officers were commissioned into the regiment before it was gradually disbanded. KAR battalions would go on to form the core of newly established armed forces throughout East Africa.

==Uniforms==

Until independence, the parade uniform of the KAR comprised khaki drill, with tall fezzes and cummerbunds. The latter items were normally red, although there were some battalion distinctions with Nyasaland units, for example, wearing black fezzes. Prior to 1914, the regiment&#x27;s field service uniforms consisted of a dark blue jersey and puttees, khaki shorts and a khaki fez cover with integral foldable cloth peak and neck flap, the designs according to Sealed Patterns procured from India. To note, although this was official regulation, a caption from 1898 describes the equipment and uniforms as being &#x27;anything procurable&#x27; and equipment shortages plagued the regiment throughout its early years. 

In 1898, good conduct stripes were also introduced, carrying an extra shilling (from originally 5 shillings a month) for those who had not been sentenced for imprisonment, confined to barracks for seven days, to a fine of more than five shillings, or corporal punishment. In addition, they also wore brown leather equipment similar to the 1888 Slade–Wallace British equivalent, but locally produced. Askaris wore sandals or were barefoot, on the rationale that the heavy military boots of the period were unsuitable for African recruits who had not previously worn footwear. Fezzes bore an Arabic or Roman number with the wartime-raised battalions wearing theirs on geometric-shaped patches of cloth. During the Great War, all the dark blue items were replaced with khaki equivalents and a short pillbox hat with a khaki cover was worn on campaign. After the war, the khaki shirt was replaced by a collarless blue-grey angora shirt called a &quot;greyback&quot;. Officers and senior NCOs wore slouch hats with coloured hackles.

==Formation==
Six battalions were formed in 1902 by the amalgamation of the Central Africa Regiment (CAR), East Africa Rifles (EAR) and Uganda Rifles, with one or two battalions located in each of Nyasaland, Kenya, Uganda and British Somaliland:
* 1st (Nyasaland) Battalion [1902–1964] with eight companies (formerly 1CAR)
* 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion [1902–1963] with six companies (formerly 2CAR)
The 1st and 2nd Battalions were also known as the 1st and 2nd Central African Battalions:
* 3rd (Kenya) Battalion [1902–1963] with seven companies and a camel company (formerly the East African Rifles)
* 4th (Uganda) Battalion [1902–1962] with nine companies (formerly the African Companies of the Uganda Rifles)
* 5th (Uganda) Battalion [1902–1904] with four companies (formerly the Indian Contingent of the Uganda Rifles) – the senior battalion as it was the first to be raised.
* 6th (British Somaliland) Battalion [1902–1910] formed from three infantry companies, the camel corps, militia and mounted infantry of the local forces in British Somaliland.

On formation, there was no regular staff system in connection with these six battalions beyond the usual regimental staff and an Inspector-General who made two annual tours and reported to the Foreign Office.

The 5th and 6th battalions were disbanded by 1910 as a cost-saving measure by the Colonial Office and out of white-settler concern over the existence of a large indigenous armed force.

==Operational history==
===Somaliland campaigns===
During the early 1900s the King&#x27;s African Rifles took part in the Somaliland campaign against Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (known to the British as the &#x27;Mad Mullah&#x27;) and the Dervishes. Lt-Col. Alexander Cobbe of 1st (Central Africa) Battalion KAR, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his action at Erego, on 6 October 1902.

The KAR were part of the British air and ground force that defeated the Dervish movement in 1920.

===First World War===

The KAR began the First World War with 21 small companies in three battalions (each with up to eight companies following the British pre-1913 half-company establishment): the 1st Nyasaland (half of the battalion was located in the northeast Nyasaland), 3rd East Africa (with one company on Zanzibar) and the 4th Uganda, both of the latter included the 4th platoon of Sudanese with the 4th platoon of 4th battalion being led by Sudanese officers. Additionally, the companies were scattered over British East Africa.

Full strength of the KAR in 1914 was 70 British officers, three British NCOs, and 2,325 Africans. There were no organic heavy weapons (each company had one machine gun), including artillery or organised reserves and the companies were, in reality, large platoons of 70 to 80 men.
In 1915 the KAR was expanded by having the three battalions reorganised into standard four-company battalions, which were then brought up to full strength at 1,045 men each. It was not until early 1916 that the 2nd Nyasaland and 5th Kenya battalions [1916–1963] were re-raised, this being due to do with white sensitivities in Kenya about arming and training large numbers of black African troops. Later in 1916 the 2nd, 3rd and 4th battalions were expanded into two battalions each through recruiting in their home areas. It was not until General Hoskins (formerly the Inspector General of the KAR) was appointed to command British East African forces in 1917 that genuine expansion began. The 1st Battalion was doubled, and the 6th (Tanganyika Territory) Battalion was raised from &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; of the former German East Africa and then it too was doubled. The 7th was formed from the Zanzibar Armed Constabulary and the Mafia Constabulary. Later in 1917 many other duplicate battalions were created as the first four battalions (now called regiments in the British tradition) each raised a 3rd battalion and a 4th or Training Battalion. The 4th Regiment raised an additional two battalions, the 5th, and 6th through recruiting in Uganda. The KAR Mounted Infantry Unit (on camels), originally part of the 3rd regiment and the KAR Signals Company were also raised.

Thus, in late 1918, the KAR consisted of 22 battalions as follows:
* Western Force: 1st KAR Regiment with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions; plus 1st and 2nd Battalions 4th KAR Regt
* Eastern Force: 2nd KAR Regiment with 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions; 1st and 2nd Battalion of the 3rd KAR; plus 3rd and 4th Battalions 4th KAR Regt
* German East Africa Garrison: 3rd Battalion of the 3rd KAR, 5th battalion of the 4th KAR, 2nd battalion of the 6th KAR, 1st Battalion of the 7th KAR.
* British East Africa Garrison: 1st Battalion of the 5th KAR, 1st Battalion of the 6th KAR
* KAR Training Force: 4th Battalion 1st KAR, 4th Battalion 2nd KAR, 4th Battalion 3rd KAR, 6th Battalion 4th KAR

Part of the KAR&#x27;s expansion involved bringing up unit strengths to the same size as British and Indian Army Imperial Service units, while also increasing the numbers of white officers and NCOs. The increase in cadres was difficult due to the shortage of Swahili-speaking whites, as many white settlers had already formed segregated units such as the East African Mounted Rifles, the East African Regiment, the Uganda Volunteer Rifles and the Zanzibar Volunteer Defence Force.

The regiment fought in the East African Campaign against the German commander Paul Erich von Lettow-Vorbeck and his forces in German East Africa. Transport and support into the interior were provided by over 400,000 porters of the Carrier Corps.

By the end of the Great War, the KAR comprised 1,193 British officers, 1,497 British NCOs and 30,658 Africans (33,348 total) in 22 battalions, including two made up of former German askaris, as noted above. In &quot;Armies in East Africa 1914–18&quot;, Peter Abbot notes that the KAR units recruited from former prisoners of war were used as garrison troops by the British, to avoid any conflict of loyalties. However, one of these battalions was involved in the pursuit of a force under Hauptman Wintgens from February to October 1917.

KAR casualties in the First World War were 5,117 killed and wounded with another 3,039 dying from diseases.

===Inter-war period===
During the interwar period, the KAR was slowly demobilised to a peacetime establishment of six battalions, at which strength the regiment remained until the Second World War. In 1938, the regiment was composed of two brigade-strength units organised as a &quot;Northern Brigade&quot; and a &quot;Southern Brigade.&quot; The combined strength of both units amounted to 94 officers, 60 non-commissioned officers, and 2,821 African other ranks. After the outbreak of war, these units provided the trained nucleus for the rapid expansion of the KAR. By March 1940, the strength of the KAR had reached 883 officers, 1,374 non-commissioned officers, and 20,026 African other ranks.

===Second World War===

The KAR fought in several campaigns during World War II. It fought against the Italians in Italian East Africa during the East African Campaign, against the Vichy French in Madagascar during the Battle of Madagascar, and against the Japanese in Burma during the Burma Campaign. The Somaliland battalions defended the colony against the Italian invasion of August 1940, but were forced to retreat and evacuate after defeat in the Battle of Tug Argan from 11 to 15 August.

KAR units were deployed as part of the 1st East African Infantry Brigade and the 2nd East African Infantry Brigade. The first brigade was responsible for coastal defence and the second for the defence of the interior. (See 1st SA Infantry Division). By the end of July 1940, two additional East African brigades were formed, the 3rd East African Infantry Brigade and the 6th East African Infantry Brigade. Initially a Coastal Division and a Northern Frontier District Division were planned, but, instead, the 11th African Division and the 12th African Division was formed.
The two divisions included East African, Ghanaian, Nigerian, and South African troops. The Ghanaian and Nigerian troops came from the Royal West African Frontier Force. Under the terms of a war contingency plan, a brigade each was provided from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and from Nigeria for service in Kenya. A Nigerian brigade, together with two East African brigades (the KAR brigades) and some South Africans, formed the 11th African Division. The 12th African Division was similarly formed, but with the Ghanaian brigade instead of the Nigerian brigade. In 1941, during the East African Campaign, Sergeant Nigel Gray Leakey of the 1/6th Battalion was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

The 11th African Division was disbanded in November 1941 and the 12th African Division was disbanded in April 1943. In 1943, the 11th (East Africa) Division was formed and it fought in Burma. Two independent infantry brigades were sent from East Africa to India for service in Burma. The 22 (East Africa) Infantry Brigade served in the Arakan in XV Indian Corps, while the 28th (East Africa) Infantry Brigade was in IV Corps, playing a crucial role in the crossing of the Irrawaddy River. By the end of the war, the regiment had raised forty-three battalions (including two in British Somaliland), nine independent garrison companies, an armoured car regiment, an artillery unit, as well as engineer, signal and transport sections.

===After the Second World War===

The regiment played a major role in operations during the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya (1952–1960). In 1952, the 7th (Kenya) Battalion was reformed; it was renumbered as the 11th (Kenya) Battalion in 1956. 2nd/3rd Battalion, a reserve unit, was raised during the military phase of the emergency in Kenya and was under consideration for disbandment by 1957. A company of the regiment perpetrated the Chuka massacre in June 1953.

The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd battalions saw service in the Malayan Emergency, where they were heavily involved in fighting Communist rebels, suffering 23 dead. The regiment was retitled the East African Land Forces in 1957. The last Colonel-in-Chief of the KAR was Queen Elizabeth II.

When the various territories from which the KAR was recruited became independent, the regiment began to break up:
* 1st Battalion1st Battalion, Malawi Rifles
* 2nd Battalion2nd Battalion, Northern Rhodesia Regiment (subsequently Zambia Regiment)
* 3rd Battalion3rd Battalion, Kenya Rifles
* 4th Battalion1st Battalion, Uganda Rifles (later formed basis of the Ugandan Army)
* 5th Battalion5th Battalion, Kenya Rifles
* 6th Battalion1st Battalion, Tanganyika Rifles
* 11th Battalion11th Battalion, Kenya Rifles
* 26th Battalion2nd Battalion, Tanganyika Rifles

The extent to which KAR traditions influence the modern national armies of the former East African colonies varies from country to country. In Tanzania, a mutiny in 1964 led to a conscious decision to move away from the British military model. In Kenya, on the other hand, the title of Kenya Rifles survives and the various campaigns in which the KAR distinguished itself in both World Wars are still commemorated.

On the island of Mauritius which is off the eastern coast of Africa, a detachment of the King&#x27;s African Rifles was present until 1960. It was gradually replaced by the newly formed Special Mobile Force (SMF) and Police Riot Unit (PRU).

Only the Kenya Rifles and the Malawi Rifles still exist.

==Battle honours==
The regiment&#x27;s battalions were not awarded colours until 1924, as colours were not traditionally carried by rifle regiments. The colours had many of the regiment&#x27;s battle honours emblazoned on it. The old colours were replaced in the 1950s.
* Ashanti 1900 (awarded 1908 for services of The Central Africa Regiment), British Somaliland 1901–04
* The Great War (7 battalions): Kilimanjaro, Narungombe, Nyangao, East Africa 1914–18

<text>An alcázar, from Arabic &quot;al-Qasr&quot;, is a type of Islamic castle or palace in Spain built during Muslim rule between the 8th and 15th centuries. They functioned as homes and regional capitals for governmental figures throughout the Umayyad caliphate and later for Christian rulers following the Iberian Reconquista. The term alcázar is also used for many medieval castles built by Christians on earlier Roman, Visigothic or Islamic fortifications and is frequently used as a synonym for &quot;castillo&quot; or castle. In Latin America there are also several colonial palaces called &quot;alcázars&quot;.

==Terminology==
The Spanish word () derives from the Arabic word &#x27;the fort/castle/palace&#x27;, that in turn derives from the Latin word (&#x27;fortress&#x27;, &#x27;military camp&#x27;).

Similar words exist in Galician (, ), Portuguese (, ), and Catalan (, ).

Spain also has Muslim citadels known as &quot;alcazabas&quot; ( ). However, not all castles in Spain are called &quot;alcázars&quot;: the majority are called in Spanish or in Catalan. Nor was every &quot;alcázar&quot; or &quot;alcazaba&quot; in Iberia built by the Muslims: many castles with these names were built after the Islamic caliphate was expelled from the Iberian Peninsula. Following the Spanish Reconquista, Christian patrons built or refurbished palaces to resemble the Islamic style, known as &quot;mudéjar&quot;.

Often, &quot;alcázars&quot; are described as &quot;Moorish&quot;, a term used by Europeans to refer to followers of the Islamic faith. While &quot;Moors&quot; has been used for centuries to reference Spanish Muslims, today however, the discussion of &quot;Moorishness&quot; is often approached with care. The term has been radicalized historically in Spain to signify the Other and exoticize the Muslim population. Modern language utilizes the terms Islamic, Muslim, and Andalusi instead of Moorish, but it is worth clarifying the historical context.

== History ==
&quot;Alcázars&quot; were owned by Islamic, and later, Christian rulers of al-Andalus, the buildings symbolized the ruler&#x27;s power and wealth over the region. Over time, the different cultural influences of the buildings merged, marking the &quot;alcázar&quot; as a transmission among Islamic, Christian and Jewish cultures.

=== Origin ===
&quot;Alcázars&quot; first became constructed under the Umayyad dynasty. It was after conquering the Visigothic Kingdom when the Umayyads began expanding on their architecture to create a sophisticated Islamic empire. After the 717 conquest, Umayyad caliphs established their capital in Córdoba, Spain, transforming the former Visigoth palace into the Alcázar of the Caliphs.

=== Umayyad dynasty (711–1010) ===
The reign of the Umayyad dynasty in Arabia ended with the rise of the Abbasid caliphate in the second half of the eighth century. Umayyad caliph Abd al-Rahman I fled the Middle East, traveling west for five years before finally settling in what would become known as al-Andalus after the Islamic conquest of Iberia in 711. He and his descendants built palaces equivalent to grand cities that became homes to rulers and Andalusian elites.

* Madinat al-Zahra was designed by Umayyad caliph Abd al-Rahman III and constructed with supervision from his son, Al-Hakam II. It was the first Umayyad palace-city located in Spain following the dynasty&#x27;s flee from the Abbasids in Iraq. Founded in 936 CE, the palace-city rivaled its counterparts in Baghdad.

=== Reconquista (897–1492) ===

Not long after the Islamic Empire reached the Pyrenees Mountains in the 8th century, Christian forces began their reconquest of Spain. Starting with the capture of Barcelona in 801 and ending with Granada in 1492, Christian rulers began the 700-year long transition from an Islamic to a Christian Spain. Many of the Islamic-styled architecture constructed by Arabic rulers became denatured under Christian rule.

* After the capture of Córdoba in 1236, Ferdinand III expanded on his campaign of devastation, reaching Seville a few years later. The siege of Seville lasted sixteen months and ended when Christian forces isolated the Muslims by land and sea, forcing them to surrender. Islamic Seville capitulated on November 23, 1248, with Castilian troops occupying the Alcázar of Seville immediately.
* The Christian king of Castile and León, King Pedro I, began commissioning Mudéjar craftsmen to build upon the alcázars all over Andalusia. The most notable additions can be seen in the Alcázar of Seville, where the decorative Islamic style was continued, featuring Arabic inscriptions in praise of King &quot;Sultan&quot; Don Pedro and Allah.

=== Nasrid dynasty (1184–1492) ===

The Nasrids were the last ruling Islamic dynasty in Iberia before falling to the Reconquista in 1492. They are known for maintaining a Muslim stronghold in southern Spain for many years despite the impending Spanish monarchy to the north. Arguably their greatest architectural accomplishment is the Alhambra located in Granada.

* The Alhambra, translated to &#x27;the red one&#x27; in English, is a large fortified palace-city built by the Nasrid dynasty to function as a royal residence. It is well known for its use of Islamic aesthetics in the architecture, along with religious inscriptions. The Alhambra contains several palaces and gardens from which Nasrid sultans conducted business and went about their daily lives.

=== Post Reconquista (1492–present day) ===
While a majority of the Muslim population was forced out of Spain following the Reconquista, some Mudéjars remained, continuing to build hybrid monuments for Christian patrons throughout the 16th century.

* In the years following the Christian reconquest of Spain, the Alhambra underwent many changes in European styles and endured some neglect. Since 1828, there has been a consistent effort to restore and conserve Islamic structures like the Alhambra in Spain.

== Common features ==

The construction that defines &quot;alcázars&quot; is the distinctive Iberian practices that can be found in the architectural design. This technique is coined as being Mudéjar in style due to the presence of Morisco and Mudéjar craftsmen throughout both Muslim and Christian rule that had largely contributed to, and had a lasting influence on, the construction of buildings. Features of the &quot;alcázars&quot; reflected Islamic influence with their geometric design and the inward-looking style emphasizing seclusion and privacy for the occupant. &quot;Alcázars&quot; of the Iberian Peninsula usually consisted of a complex system of buildings with multiple palaces, halls, and courtyards, all serving a specific function.

=== Gardens ===
Gardens played a vital role in the settlement of Islamic Spain, providing a space of relaxation, economic benefits, and the illusion of paradise to its beholder. &quot;Alcázar&quot; courtyards housed some of the most grandiose gardens in the region, reflecting the wealth of its ruler. The influence of the gardens can be seen today as some gardens still remain, having been preserved and admired by the Christian rulers post-Muslim rule.

Inner courtyard gardens was the most common approach of horticulture in the &quot;alcázars&quot;. Gardens would be placed into a system of interconnected courtyards where the buildings completely enclosed the space. The gardens were kept from outside view, following Islamic architectural practices of an inward, plain interior that disguised decorated, private areas; only those fortunate enough could witness the courtyards.

Basic components of the &quot;alcázar&quot; gardens included: a raised grid formation, an irrigation system with a collecting pool as its distribution point, and formal walkways and pavement. Continued influence of Islamic techniques can be seen in the composition of the gardens that are geometric, symmetrical, and often quadripartite arrangement, known as &quot;charbaghs&quot;. A range of shrubs, trees, vegetables and flowers were grown in these gardens. The fruits could be cultivated and marketable while also supplying the garden with a pleasant fragrance and aesthetic beauty. The fruit trees in the gardens of the Alcázar of Seville are reported to have introduced new, &quot;exotic&quot; fruits to Europe such as lemons, oranges, apricots, and peaches.

==== Water system ====

Constant irrigation was necessary to maintain the lush flora of the gardens. Intricate Arabic irrigation designs were incorporated into the courtyards of the &quot;alcázars&quot; by Muslim rulers to serve multiple purposes. The systems supplied the gardens with a constant flow of fresh water, aesthetically refreshed the space, and had a cooling effect on the courtyard and surrounding buildings. Each irrigation system of the &quot;alcázars&quot; had unique elements, defining the individuality of the location. These techniques ranged from still pools, flowing channels, and fountains, and were implemented to achieve a visual and architectural link from exterior to interior spaces. Water created a sense of peace and spiritual stability in the gardens.

* The Comares Palace of the Alhambra uses a large pool in the center of the courtyard as both a functioning irrigation system and an artistic spectacle. Shrubbery flanked the sides of the pool and therefore had access to water and the pool reflects the two porticoed sides of the surrounding buildings, providing an interesting illusion to the viewer.
* The courtyards in the Alcázar of Seville feature an irrigation tank with flower beds on each side, along with aqueducts dividing deeply sunken flower beds. The flower beds are arranged in a geometric pattern with channels providing water from a central basin.

=== Inscriptions ===
Since the Umayyad dynasty, displays of monumental inscriptions with religious or civic purpose are commonly seen on the entrances and façades of Iberian architecture. In both Muslim-built and Christian Mudéjar palaces in Spain, inscriptions are prevalent in the palace design. One instance is the Alhambra in Granada where Arabic inscriptions are present throughout the palace walls. Some of these inscriptions include excerpts from the Quran, poetry written by Ibn al-Khatib and Ibn Zamrak, and the Nasrid dynasty&#x27;s motto. A recurring saying throughout is also present, ولا غالب إلا الله or &quot;there is no victor but God.&quot;

At the Alcázar of Seville, a mix of Arabic and Spanish inscriptions uplift the bilingual atmosphere of Mudéjar style Spanish architecture. The palaces&#x27;s patron, Peter of Castile, was a Christian that embraced the Muslims&#x27; taste for beauty in the form of the Islamic decoration, including inscriptions in Arabic, &quot;alcázar&quot;.
=== Triumphal arch ===
Arches—either single or triple, in the form of Roman triumphal arches—in the &quot;alcázars&quot; of al-Andalus were used to provide formal and symbolic character to the buildings. They are rich in Islamic-inspired decoration and are located strategically; commonly opening up to the main squares or courtyards.

* The Alhambra emulates a triumphal arch between the Puerta del Vino (wine gate) and the Puerta de la Justicia (justice gate). It is decorated with various colors and ornamentation that includes a stucco of the coat of arms from the Band of the Sultan Muhammad V of Granada (1354–1359 and 1362–1391) The arches in the Alhambra serve multiple purposes, one opening into the grant courtyards of the building, and the other providing a view outside to Granada—where the rulers could contemplate the land they controlled.
* The Alcázar of Seville features a triumphal arch at the entrance to the Patio de la Montería, opening up to the palace&#x27;s monumental façade. The triple archway is decorated in heraldic designs, including the badge of Knights of the Band.

* Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos, also called &quot;the Alcázar of Córdoba&quot;, located in Córdoba, Andalusia, is an Islamic palace that became a Christian site after the 13th century Reconquista of Córdoba. The Muslims had expanded a Visigoth fortress into a large compound with gardens and a large library. This &quot;alcázar&quot; was the summer home of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, and the site of their meeting with Christopher Columbus before his famous voyage to the Americas.
* The Alcázar of the Caliphs of Córdoba was the seat of the government of al-Andalus, and the residence of the emirs and caliphs of Córdoba since the arrival of the Muslims in the 8th century until the Christian conquest of the city, in 1236. It had a total area of 39,000 square metres (420,000 sq ft). Part of its structure survives.
* Alcázar of Jerez de la Frontera, was a fortified palace-city located in Southern Spain. In 1931, it was designated as a Spanish Historic site, Bien de Interés Cultural. Today, it functions as a public park for locals in Jerez de la Frontera.
* Alcázar of Segovia was first cited in the 12th century, though its foundations date back to Roman times. It is a castle built by the Christian monarchs in the place of an Islamic fort. During the Middle Ages when in the Kingdom of Castile, the &quot;alcázar&quot; of Segovia was the favorite residence of the Castilian monarchs, and almost each successive king added new parts to the building, transforming the original fortress into a courtier residence and prolonging the construction of the castle until the 16th century, when king Philip II added the conical spires and the slate roofs. A fire in 1862 destroyed part of the roofs, but they were restored in the very same style in which they were built 300 years before. In this castle there was the proclamation of Isabella I as Queen of Castile in 1474 starting the War of the Castilian Succession.
* Alcázar of Seville, on the site of the palace of the Almohad Caliphate called &quot;al-Muwarak&quot;, was built in the 1360s by Christian Castilian craftsmen in Mudéjar style, and frequently remodeled. It was first used by Peter of Castile with his mistress María de Padilla. The structures and gardens are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
* Alcázar of Toledo was formerly used as a Roman palace in the 3rd century and then restored under Charles V. It was then used as a military academy in modern times. The Siege of the Alcázar in the Spanish Civil War references this castle, which was held by the Nationalist colonel José Moscardó Ituarte against Republican forces. Republican forces captured Moscardó&#x27;s 24-year-old son Luis, and on 23 July 1936 informed Moscardó that if he did not turn over the alcázar within ten minutes his son would die. When Moscardó did not surrender, Luis was murdered, not immediately but one month later, on 23 August. 
* The Alhambra in Granada, a palace and complex fortress. It was the last Muslim stronghold in al-Andalus before it functioned as a royal Christian palace following the Reconquista. Today it serves as one of Spain&#x27;s most popular tourist sites.

=== Extinct landmark &quot;alcázars&quot; ===

* The Castle of Burgos was originally built by Muslims in Spain but became known as a royal residence commonly used by the kings of Castile. It lost value after the Habsburg family acquired the palace and following its partial destruction at the hands of French forces in 1813. Citizens attempted to partially restore the palace in the late 20th century, it now hosts a museum where visitors can view remaining portions of the castle grounds.
* The Royal Alcazar of Madrid was a palace built by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, (rebuilt by his son, Philip II) and was the main royal residence in Madrid until the Buen Retiro Palace partly superseded it in the 17th century. It was destroyed by fire in 1734, and the present Royal Palace of Madrid was built on the site.
* The Castle Alcázar of Segorbe, province of Castellón, autonomous community of Valencia, was an enormous complex that for over a thousand years was the residence of lords, dukes and kings.

===Outside Spain===

Outside Spain, in Palermo, Sicily, the Cassaro corresponds to the Punic settlement of Zis, on high ground that was refortified by the Arabs and known as &quot;al-qaṣr&quot; and was further expanded as the site of the later Norman palace.

The colonial palace in Santo Domingo, built for Christopher Columbus&#x27;s son Diego in 1509, is called the Alcázar de Colón (Columbus&#x27;s &quot;alcázar&quot;).

<doc id="345955" wikidata="Q3990858" url="?curid=345955" title="Three-peat">
<text>In sports (especially in North America), a three-peat is winning three consecutive championships or tournaments. The term, a portmanteau of the words &quot;three&quot; and &quot;repeat&quot;, originated with the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association, during their unsuccessful campaign for a third consecutive championship during the 1988–89 season, having won the previous two NBA finals.
==Origin and trademark==
The term is a registered trademark owned by Pat Riley, the Lakers&#x27; head coach from 1981 to 1990. The original owner and assignor of the underlying THREE-PEAT &quot;mark&quot; was Bijan Khezri, former president of P.d.P. Paperon De Paperoni, a Delaware corporation. Khezri submitted in November 1988 a trademark application for the use of &quot;three-peat&quot; on shirts, jackets and hats. Around that time, the phrase was being used by members and fans of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, of whom Pat Riley was the head coach, regarding the Lakers&#x27; quest that season to obtain what would have been a third successive NBA championship. According to Riley, it was Laker player Byron Scott who cited the term in reference to the team&#x27;s goal for that season.

After Khezri assigned the trademark to Riley, it remained an entity of Riles &amp; Co., the corporate entity of National Basketball Association (NBA) coach Pat Riley.
In 1989, Riles &amp; Co. successfully registered the trademark under U.S. Registration Number 1552980. The Lakers did not win a third consecutive NBA championship in 1989, but the Chicago Bulls did in 1993, and Riles &amp; Co. collected royalties from sports apparel makers who licensed the phrase for use on merchandise commemorating that accomplishment. 

Riles &amp; Co. subsequently obtained additional registrations expanding the trademark to cover many other kinds of merchandise in addition to apparel. The company then went on to reap additional profits by again licensing the phrase to merchandisers when the Bulls again won three consecutive NBA championships from 1996 through 1998, as well as when the New York Yankees won three straight World Series championships from 1998 through 2000 and when the Lakers won three straight NBA championships from 2000 through 2002. It was the Lakers&#x27; second three-peat in franchise history and only their first since moving from Minneapolis. As of 2025, the Lakers are the last team of the four major American professional sports (NHL, MLB, NFL, NBA) to achieve a three-peat. Incidentally, Pat Riley was the head coach of the losing teams (New York Knicks in 1992 and 1993, Miami Heat in 1996 and 1997) that were eliminated by the Bulls during their 1991-93 and 1996-98 three-peats of NBA Championships. Phil Jackson was the head coach of the Bulls for both of these three-peats, and serving in that same capacity for the Lakers when they achieved their second three-peat.

While originating in the United States, the three-peat has been replicated all over the world across different sports. In recent times, Spanish association football club Real Madrid notably became the first club of the modern era to win three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles (2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18).

The trademark registration for &quot;three-peat&quot; has been challenged over the years by those who argue that the term has become too generic in its usage for the trademark to continue to be applicable. However, such arguments have yet to succeed, with the registration continuing to be upheld by the United States Patent and Trademark Office as recently as 2001, in the case of &quot;Christopher Wade v. Riles &amp; Co&quot;. This challenge documented the transfer of assignment from Khezri to Riles &amp; Co., and upheld the validity of the trademark as originally conceived.

In 2005, a group of individuals attempted to trademark the phrase &quot;Three-Pete&quot; in anticipation of the (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt that year by the 2005 USC Trojans football team to win a third consecutive national championship. The change in spelling was a reference to the team&#x27;s head coach, Pete Carroll. However, the Patent Office ruled that the change in spelling was not dissimilar enough from Riles &amp; Co.&#x27;s &quot;three-peat&quot;, and denied the registration. Later that year, U.S.C. fan Kyle Bunch began selling his own &quot;Three-Pete&quot; T-shirts. He discontinued sales once he was notified that he was infringing upon the Riles &amp; Co. trademark.

==In popular use==
In a comedic context, the same play on words, additionally incorporating the name &quot;Pete&quot;, is known to have been used as early as 1930 on the radio program &quot;Empire Builders&quot;. The episode of that program broadcast on December 29, 1930, featured a trio of singers dubbed &quot;The Three Visiting Firemen: Pete, Re-Pete, and Three-Pete&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; credits an Illinois high school senior, Sharif Ford, with the earliest published use of the word in the March 8, 1989, edition of the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;. Ford&#x27;s quote uses the term in a sporting context and serves to provide a clear etymology as well:

The Lincoln High Tigers say they want to &quot;three-peat&quot;. &quot;You know, kind of like repeat, except doing it for the third time&quot;, senior Sharif Ford said.
== Three-peats in North American leagues/championships ==
There have been numerous instances of teams winning three or more consecutive championships in the National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, National Football League, and Australian Football League, most of which occurred prior to the advent of the term &quot;three-peat&quot;.

==National Football League==
In the National Football League (NFL), a Super Bowl championship three-peat has not been accomplished. Two-time defending Super Bowl champions who failed to three-peat include the Green Bay Packers (1968), Miami Dolphins (1974), Pittsburgh Steelers (twice: 1976, 1980), San Francisco 49ers (1990), Dallas Cowboys (1994), Denver Broncos (1999), New England Patriots (2005), and Kansas City Chiefs (2024). The Chiefs became the first two-time defending Super Bowl champion to reach the Super Bowl, but lost Super Bowl LIX to the Philadelphia Eagles, the team they had previously defeated two years prior in Super Bowl LVII. The other eight teams failed to return to the title game in the third season (indicated in parentheses).

The Buffalo Bills went to 4 consecutive Super Bowls as the AFC champions from 1990 to 1993, which is a feat unmatched in NFL history; however, they lost in every appearance. The Miami Dolphins (1971-73), New England Patriots (2016-18), and Kansas City Chiefs (2022-24) have each won 3 consecutive Conference championships (and appeared in 3 straight Super Bowls) in their history.

In the early years of the NFL, decades before the introduction of either the term &quot;three-peat&quot; or the Super Bowl, the Packers won three consecutive NFL titles from 1929–31. This was achieved without playing any postseason playoff games, as the league title was determined at that time from the season standings. In addition, the Packers won the NFL championship in 1965, at a time when the rival NFL and AFL played separate exclusive championships. They then followed that 1965 championship with their first two Super Bowl victories in 1966 and 1967 (their Super Bowl berths were earned by winning both the 1966 NFL Championship Game and 1967 NFL Championship Game), thereby winning championships three years in a row.

==Related terms==
There have been efforts to come up with a similarly clever name for the potential fourth consecutive championship in the year following a three-peat. But attempts such as &quot;quat-row&quot; have thus far failed to catch on, and most fans simply use the term &quot;four-peat&quot;. Since the term &quot;three-peat&quot; came into usage, however, only one team in major American sports has been able to achieve it – Hendrick Racing/Jimmie Johnson NASCAR team, who won 5 championships in a row.

The wordplay of &quot;three-peat&quot; is clearer if &quot;repeat&quot; is stressed on the first syllable; this pronunciation is uncommon outside North America. Other English-speaking people may instead talk of a hat trick of championships, or simply a three-in-a-row.

There are also terms for winning three trophies in the same season:
*Triple Crown – various sports
*Treble (association football)
*Grand slam – Philippine Basketball Association

The trifecta (also known as a tricast, triactor or tierce) is a concept in gambling in which a bettor successfully guesses the win, place and show in a particular race.

<doc id="345957" wikidata="Q410882" url="?curid=345957" title="Phthalic anhydride">
<text>Phthalic anhydride is the organic compound with the formula C6H4(CO)2O. It is the anhydride of phthalic acid. Phthalic anhydride is a principal commercial form of phthalic acid. It was the first anhydride of a dicarboxylic acid to be used commercially. This white solid is an important industrial chemical, especially for the large-scale production of plasticizers for plastics. In 2000, the worldwide production volume was estimated to be about 3 million tonnes per year.

==Synthesis and production==
Phthalic anhydride was first reported in 1836 by Auguste Laurent. Early procedures involved liquid-phase mercury-catalyzed oxidation of naphthalene. The modern industrial variant process instead uses vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) as the catalyst in a gas-phase reaction with naphthalene using molecular oxygen. The overall process involves oxidative cleavage of one of the rings and loss of two of the carbon atoms as carbon dioxide.

An alternative process involves oxidation of the two methyl groups of &quot;o&quot;-xylene, a more atom-economical process. This reaction is run at about 320–400 °C and has the following stoichiometry:
:C6H4(CH3)2 + 3 O2 → C6H4(CO)2O + 3 H2O
The reaction proceeds with about 70% selectivity. About 10% of maleic anhydride is also produced: 
:C6H4(CH3)2 +  O2 → C4H2O3 + 4 H2O + 4 CO2
Phthalic anhydride and maleic anhydride are recovered by distillation by a series of switch condensers.

The naphthalene route (the Gibbs phthalic anhydride process or the Gibbs–Wohl naphthalene oxidation reaction) has declined relative to the &quot;o&quot;-xylene route.

Phthalic anhydride can also be prepared from phthalic acid by simple thermal dehydration above 210°C.

==Uses==
===Phthalate esters plasticizers===
The primary use of phthalic anhydride is a precursor to phthalate esters, used as plasticizers in vinyl chloride. Phthalate esters are derived from phthalic anhydride by the alcoholysis reaction. In the 1980s, approximately 6.5 million tonnes of these esters were produced annually, and the scale of production was increasing each year, all from phthalic anhydride. The process begins with the reaction of phthalic anhydride with alcohols, giving the monoesters:
:C6H4(CO)2O + ROH → C6H4(CO2H)CO2R
The second esterification is more difficult and requires removal of water:
:C6H4(CO2H)CO2R + ROH C6H4(CO2R)2 + H2O
The most important diester is bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (&quot;DEHP&quot;), used in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride compounds.

===Precursor to dyestuffs===

Phthalic anhydride is widely used in industry for the production of certain dyes. A well-known application of this reactivity is the preparation of the anthraquinone dye quinizarin by reaction with &quot;para&quot;-chlorophenol followed by hydrolysis of the chloride. Phenolphthalein can be synthesized by the condensation of phthalic anhydride with two equivalents of phenol under acidic conditions (hence the name). It was discovered in 1871 by Adolf von Baeyer.
===Pharmaceuticals===
Phthalic anhydride treated with cellulose acetate gives cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), a common enteric coating excipient that has also been shown to have antiviral activity. Phthalic anhydride is a degradation product of CAP.

==Reactions==
Phthalic anhydride is a versatile intermediate in organic chemistry, in part because it is bifunctional and cheaply available.

===Hydrolysis, alcoholysis, ammonolysis===
Hydrolysis by hot water forms &quot;ortho&quot;-phthalic acid:
:C6H4(CO)2O + H2O → C6H4(CO2H)2
Hydrolysis of anhydrides is not typically a reversible process. Phthalic acid is however easily dehydrated to form phthalic anhydride. Above 180 °C, phthalic anhydride re-forms.

Chiral alcohols form half-esters (see above), and these derivatives are often resolvable because they form diastereomeric salts with chiral amines such as brucine. A related ring-opening reaction involves peroxides to give the useful peroxy acid:
:C6H4(CO)2O + H2O2 → C6H4(CO3H)CO2H
Phthalimide can be prepared by heating phthalic anhydride with aqueous ammonia giving a 95–97% yield. Alternatively, it may be prepared by treating the anhydride with ammonium carbonate or urea. It can also be produced by ammoxidation of &quot;o&quot;-xylene. Potassium phthalimide is commercially available and is the potassium salt of phthalimide. It may be prepared by adding a hot solution of phthalimide to a solution of potassium hydroxide; the desired product precipitates.

===Preparation of aliphatic nitroalkenes===
Phthalic anhydride is used to dehydrate short-chain nitro-alcohols to yield nitroalkenes, compounds with a high tendency to polymerize.

==Safety==
The most probable human exposure to phthalic anhydride is through skin contact or inhalation during manufacture or use. Studies show that exposure to phthalic anhydride can cause rhinitis, chronic bronchitis, and asthma. Phthalic anhydride&#x27;s reaction on human health is generally an asthma–rhinitis–conjunctivitis syndrome or a delayed reaction and influenza-like symptoms and with increased immunoglobulin (E and G) levels in the blood.

<text>Operation Ambassador was an operation carried out by British Commandos on 14–15 July 1940 within the context of the Second World War. It was the second raid by the newly formed British Commandos and was focused upon the German-occupied Channel island of Guernsey.

The raiding party consisted of 40 men from the newly formed No. 3 Commando under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Durnford-Slater, and 100 men of No.11 Independent Company under Major Ronnie Tod.

Due to a series of mishaps, poor fortune and the haste with which it was planned and implemented, the raid resulted in no immediate military gains for the British, although the experience gained in the mounting and conduct of the operation was to prove invaluable for the success of subsequent Commando operations. In addition to this the island of Guernsey started a process of fortification at high expense and involving diverting resources from other fronts, it could be described as one of the most successful raids of the war.

==Background==
On 30 June 1940 the Germans landed troops on the Channel Islands. Two days later, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill sent a memo to his chief staff officer, General Hastings Ismay, asking him to begin planning an operation for a raid on the islands as soon as possible and stating that he felt that it would be the type of operations that the newly formed Commandos would be suited for. After that, things began moving very quickly. Indeed, the War Office approved the proposal for an operation later that day and shortly after planning began in earnest.

Code named &quot;Ambassador&quot;, it was decided that the operation would follow two preliminary operations code named &quot;Anger&quot;. The preliminary operations would be undertaken to gather necessary intelligence prior to a raid by 140 men which would land on the island of Guernsey and attack the airfield with the purpose of destroying aircraft and buildings, as well as capturing or killing members of the garrison. The units that were chosen for the raid were &#x27;H&#x27; Troop from No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company. No. 3 Commando, under Lieutenant Colonel John Durnford-Slater, had only just been raised, having completed its recruitment on 5 July, and had not yet begun training, while No. 11 Independent Company under the command of Major Ronnie Tod had been raised earlier in June and had a few weeks earlier undertaken Operation Collar, which had been a hastily organised and largely unsuccessful raid on Boulogne. During the planning stage, Durnford-Slater went to London where he worked out most of the details with David Niven, who was then serving as a staff officer in the Combined Operations Headquarters.

On the night of 7/8 July a reconnaissance operation was carried out, when Lieutenant Hubert Nicolle, an officer in the Hampshire Regiment who was originally from Guernsey and first commissioned in the Royal Guernsey Militia, was landed on the island by the submarine HMS &quot;H43&quot;. Three days later he was picked up and based on the information that he provided it was determined that the garrison on Guernsey consisted of 469 soldiers, concentrated mainly around St. Peter Port and although there were machine gun posts all along the coast, they were sited in a manner that meant that it would take about twenty minutes between an alarm being raised for reinforcements to be dispatched.

==Raid==
The original plan had been for the raid to be carried out on the night of 12/13 July, however, at the last moment it was put back to 14/15 July. Even then, shortly before embarcation, Durnford-Slater received intelligence that the Germans had reinforced a number of the places where it had been planned to land some of the parties and as such the plan was changed at the last moment. After the details were worked out, final battle preparations were undertaken in the gymnasium at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth where some of the cadets helped the commandos with loading magazines and helping prepare the Bren guns and Thompson sub-machine guns that had been brought down from London specifically for the operation.

At 17:45 the raiding force embarked upon the two destroyers, HMS &quot;Scimitar&quot; and HMS &quot;Saladin&quot; and accompanied by six Royal Air Force air-sea rescue launches, who would take them from the destroyers to the landing beaches, they set out for the island of Guernsey. Due to the loud noise of the engines of the RAF launches, it was arranged that RAF Avro Ansons would fly over the island to disguise the sound of the engines.

Under the plan that Durnford-Slater had worked out he had the troops from the independent company attacking the airfield, while the commandos were to create a diversion. To this end, three landing points were selected; however, in the end only the diversionary force from No.3 Commando, consisting of only 40 men, was able to land successfully, landing at a beach in Telegraph Bay just west of the Jerbourg Peninsula at 00:50 on 15 July, despite a faulty compass on the launch.

One party of No.11 were taken to the wrong island (Sark) as a result of another faulty compass, landing on Little Sark the team explored La Sablonnerie and not finding any Germans returned safely to the destroyer. Another party crashed into a rock and the other two launches broke down after experiencing a series of technical problems.

Although they managed to get ashore—albeit soaking wet—the party from No. 3 Commando failed to find any of the 469-man German garrison. Despite locating a German barracks and a machine gun nest, both had been abandoned prior to their arrival. One islander was encountered only as he had a speech impediment, he was knocked unconscious to keep him quiet. They demolished a loose garden wall to make a small road block. Not hearing any noise from the direction of the airport, they decided to quietly retreat. The rendezvous with the destroyers that were picking them up was at 03:00 and if they were late the destroyers were under orders to leave them behind, so the party subsequently returned to the beach, stopping to cut a couple of telegraph lines on the way. Upon arriving at the landing beach, the raiders discovered that they had to extract themselves by swimming some out to their boats as the tide had risen too high for their motor craft to beach among the rocks.

At this stage it was discovered that three of the men from &#x27;H&#x27; Troop, No. 3 Commando could not swim and had to be left on the beach with additional French currency. Although Durnford-Slater requested that a submarine be sent back for these men, the Admiralty decided that it could not take the risk and as a result the men later surrendered. During the extraction, a dinghy was used to ferry weapons to the boats, but on the fifth excursion it was dashed against a rock and overturned. One of the boat&#x27;s two occupants, a soldier, was presumed drowned at the time, although later it was reported that he actually managed to get ashore and was subsequently captured.

==Aftermath==

The raid was ultimately a failure as none of the objectives were achieved by the British. No casualties were inflicted upon the Germans, no prisoners were taken, and the only damage inflicted was a cut telephone line. Additionally, the quality of the planning and conduct of the operation has been called into question. Much of the equipment used was either not serviceable—faulty compasses, and motor launches that broke down—or inadequate for the job and launches that were unable to come all the way into the beach due to their draught. Also some of the tasks that had been assigned were impractical or had not been rehearsed—the wire intended for use as a road block was too heavy to carry from the beach—and intelligence relating to German dispositions upon the island was at best outdated or completely wrong. The commandos also found they were burdened with equipment that was not of use, including steel helmets, gaiters and an excess of ammunition. Largely this was the result of the haste with which the operation had been conceived and then put together, but it was also indicative of the embryonic status of the raiding and commandos concept.

On the political side, the raid was also a disaster. Churchill was said to have been furious regarding the &quot;comical&quot; way in which the operation was undertaken, and it has been alleged that for some months the whole Commando concept was &quot;in jeopardy&quot; with authorities considering their disbandment, although this did not eventuate. As a concept, the Commandos went on to perform with considerable success later in the war. Indeed, it has been argued by authors such as Durnford-Slater and Parker that the Commandos&#x27; future success in operations such as &quot;Overlord&quot; was in part due to the early failures such as &quot;Ambassador&quot; as many lessons were learned that proved vital in the planning and conduct of future Commando operations. According to Richard Strappini, the government&#x27;s embarrassment of the operation resulted in a lack of the individual acts of bravery being recognised.

Nevertheless, there were widespread changes. The independent companies were in turn disbanded and their personnel used to raise the first 12 commando units. Much work went into the training and planning side of raiding also, and for the next eight months the commandos did little except train. To this end formalised training schemes and schools were established and Churchill sought to invigorate the concept by replacing General Bourne, who had previously been the Director of Combined Operations, with Admiral Sir Roger Keyes.

<text>Anan Ben David (, c. 715 - c. 795) is widely considered to be a major founder of Karaite Judaism. His followers were called Ananites and, like modern Karaites, did not believe the Rabbinic Jewish Oral Torah, such as the Mishnah, to be authoritative.

==History==
From the second third of the 7th century and until middle of the 8th, as a result of the tremendous intellectual commotion produced throughout the West Asia by the swift early Muslim conquests and the collision of Islam with the religions and cultures of the world, there arose a large number of religious sects, especially in Persia, Iraq, and Syria. Judaism did not escape this general fomentation; the remnants of Second Temple sects picked up new life and flickered once more before their final extinction, and new sects also arose.

&quot;Anan&quot;, which means &quot;Cloud&quot;, was never a very common name among Jews, but it is attested in the Bible: the original Anan was one of the Israelites who sealed the covenant after the return from the Babylonian captivity in Nehemiah 10. ().

Some polemical accounts supply Anan with a typical background story often used of &quot;heretics&quot;—namely, that he was frustrated in a bid for power within the religious community and as a result broke away. According to these accounts, the Exilarch or leader of the Jews in Mesopotamia, probably Isaac Iskawi, died about 760. Two brothers among his nearest kin, probably his nephews, Anan and Josiah (Hassan), were next in order of succession to the exalted office. Eventually, Josiah was elected exilarch by the geonim or leaders of the Talmudic academies in Babylonia and by the notables of the chief Jewish congregations. The choice was confirmed by Abbasid caliph al-Mansur (754–775).

The story continues that Anan was proclaimed exilarch by his followers, an act construed by the Muslim authorities as a rebellion against the authority of the caliph, who had formally invested Josiah with the position. He was arrested by the authorities one Sunday in 767 and was to be executed on the ensuing Friday for high treason.

Luckily for Anan, the story goes, he met in jail a prominent fellow prisoner, the founder of the Hanafi school of Islam, Abu Hanifah. He gave Anan advice which saved his life: He should set himself to expound all ambiguous precepts of the Torah in a fashion opposed to the traditional interpretation and make this principle the foundation of a new religious sect. He must next get his partisans to secure the presence of the caliph himself at the trial, which was not an unusual thing for important prosecutions. Anan was to declare that his religion was different from Rabbinic Judaism and that his followers entirely coincided with him in matters of religious doctrine. This was an easy matter for Anan to say, because the majority of them were opposed to the rabbis. Complying with this advice, Anan defended himself in the presence of the caliph Al-Mansur, who granted his favor.

The story so closely fits polemical clichés about the personal motives of &quot;heretics&quot; that it is open to grave doubt. Moreover, Leon Nemoy notes, &quot;Natronai, scarcely ninety years after Anan&#x27;s secession, tells us nothing about his aristocratic (Davidic) descent or about the contest for the office of exilarch which allegedly served as the immediate cause of his apostasy.&quot; He later notes that Natronai, a devout Rabbinic Jew, lived where Anan&#x27;s activities took place and that the Karaite sage Jacob Qirqisani never mentioned Anan&#x27;s purported lineage or candidacy for exilarch. (See &quot;Karaite Anthology&quot;; Yale Judaica Series 7)

Anan ben David&#x27;s &quot;Sefer ha-Miṣwot&quot; or &quot;Book of the Precepts&quot; was published about 770. He adopted many principles and opinions of other anti-rabbinic forms of Judaism. It has been suggested that he took much from the Sadducees and Essenes, whose writings (or at least writings ascribed to them) were still in circulation. For example, these older sects prohibited the burning of any lights and the leaving of one&#x27;s dwelling on Shabbat; they also enjoined the actual observation of the new moon for the appointment of festivals and celebrated Shavuot, one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals, on a Sunday.

==Fundamental principles of Ananism==
Abu Hanifa was accustomed in certain cases to take the words of the Qur&#x27;an not in their literal, but in a symbolic sense. Anan adopted a similar method with the Hebrew text of the Bible. Illustrations of this method are not infrequently, indeed, afforded by the Talmud itself. Thus he interpreted the prohibition of plowing on the Sabbath (Ex. xxxiv. 21) as applying to marital intercourse; the word &quot;brothers&quot; (aḥim, Deut. xxv. 5) in connection with the levirate marriage he interpreted as &quot;relatives,&quot; etc. Anan&#x27;s method of interpretation, however, was distinct from its Muslim counterpart in that he primarily built upon analogy of expressions (similar to Muslim qiyas), words (the rabbinical &quot;gezerah shavah&quot;), and single letters.

Some sources claim that Anan borrowed the belief in the transmigration of the soul (metempsychosis) from Muslim sectarians. This doctrine, represented in Greek antiquity especially by Empedocles and the Pythagoreans, had always been widespread in India, and even though it was found among some Muslim sects, such as the followers of ibn al-Rawandi, it was also a central tenet of Manichaeism, which was enjoying something of a renaissance in the region at the time of Anan. He is said to have written a special work in its defense. The belief in transmigration is also found in Kabbalah.

==Ananism in practice==
A number of ben David&#x27;s teachings differ from those of Rabbinic Jews and of the majority of modern Karaites. Anan rejected the admeasurements instituted by the rabbis (shi&#x27;urim); and instead of any permissible minimum for prohibited things—which the Talmud admits, as for instance &quot;shishim&quot; (one part in sixty), or ke-zait (&quot;the size of an olive&quot;), etc.—he insisted that even the smallest atom of anything prohibited, mingling with an infinitely large quantity of a thing permitted, was sufficient to render the whole of the latter prohibited.

In addition, he maintained that as long as Israel is in exile the flesh of animals, with the exception of the deer, the pigeon and the turtle-dove, is forbidden from being eaten (although permitted animals may be eaten with dairy). Within Judaism, restrictions on consuming meat and poultry that extend beyond the Rabbinic concept of kashrut are not unique to Ananism; the Talmud relates that after the destruction of the Second Temple, certain ascetics such as Abu Isa sought to prohibit meat and wine because they had been employed in the Temple ritual, and that Joshua ben Hananiah repressed the movement. In modern times, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the first Ashkenazic chief rabbi of the British Mandatory Palestine, argued that vegetarianism is supported in the Tanakh as a Jewish ideal.

==Rules for slaughtering==
To this limitation of the eating of meat must also be added his regulation concerning the personality of the individual who slays creatures for food; Anan rejected the broad precept of the Talmud that &quot;slaughtering is permissible to anybody,&quot; demanded a certain dignity for the act, and required from the slaughterer a complete profession of faith. From this dates the Karaite custom of reciting the articles of the creed preparatory to slaughtering. Finally, not satisfied with the Talmudic dictum that in the act of slaughtering it is sufficient to cut through two ducts—gullet and windpipe—Anan required that in addition two more—arteries or veins—should be severed. In addition to the legal fast-days appointed by the Bible, Anan, by means of word-analogies instituted the following: The seventh day of every month; the 14th and 15th of Adar instead of the rabbinical fast of the 13th, including thus the Purim festival; also a seventy-days&#x27; fast from the 13th of Nisan to the 23d of Siwan; including Passover and Shavuot as times of fasting when neither food nor drink could be partaken of by day.

==Rules for Sabbath==
It was forbidden to go outside of one&#x27;s dwelling on the Sabbath except for purposes of prayer or necessity. Anything that is ordinarily carried on the shoulders, owing to its size or weight, might not be carried around even in a room. Anan&#x27;s law-book insists that the Sabbath evening (Friday) must be passed in darkness: lights kindled in the daytime on Friday must be extinguished at nightfall, for it is forbidden to pass the Sabbath in a place artificially illuminated. Cooking and baking must be done on Friday, not only for Friday and Saturday, but also for Saturday night, to forestall any impatient longing for the close of the Sabbath. Foods already prepared must not be kept warm, but eaten cold. Unleavened bread (Maẓẓah) must be made exclusively of barley-meal, and he that prepares it out of wheaten meal incurs the punishment appointed for those that eat actual leaven (ḥameẓ). Nor may this unleavened bread be baked in an oven, but, like the paschal lamb, it must be roasted on the coals.

==Science==
Anan ben David, in direct contradiction of Karaites such as Daniel Al-Kumisi, had small respect for science as is often shown in his law-book. He forbids the use of medicines and of medical aid in general, for it is written, he says, &quot;I, God, am thy physician&quot; (Ex. xv. 26); this is held to prohibit drugs and doctors. His opposition to the astronomical determination of the festivals, of which he boasted to the caliph, led him to declare astronomy as a branch of the astrology and divination forbidden in the Bible, thus undermining the very foundation of the rabbinical calendar.

<text>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch is a regional newspaper based in St. Louis, Missouri, serving the St. Louis metropolitan area. It is the largest daily newspaper in the metropolitan area by circulation, surpassing the &quot;Belleville News-Democrat&quot;, &quot;Alton Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;Edwardsville Intelligencer&quot;. The publication has received 19 Pulitzer Prizes.

The paper is owned by Lee Enterprises of Davenport, Iowa, which purchased Pulitzer, Inc. in 2005 in a cash deal valued at $1.46 billion.

==Platform==
On April 10, 1907, Joseph Pulitzer wrote what became known as the paper&#x27;s platform:

I know that my retirement will make no difference in its cardinal principles, that it will always fight for progress and reform, never tolerate injustice or corruption, always fight demagogues of all parties, never belong to any party, always oppose privileged classes and public plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing news, always be drastically independent, never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty.

==History==
===Early years===
In 1878, Pulitzer purchased the bankrupt &quot;St. Louis Dispatch&quot; at a public auction and merged it with the &quot;St. Louis Evening Post&quot; to create the &quot;St. Louis Post and Dispatch&quot;, whose title was soon shortened to its current form. He appointed John A. Cockerill as the managing editor. Its first edition, 4,020 copies of four pages each, appeared on December 12, 1878.

In 1882, James Overton Broadhead ran for Congress against John Glover. The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, at Cockerill&#x27;s direction, ran a number of articles questioning Broadhead&#x27;s role in a lawsuit between a gaslight company and the city; Broadhead never responded to the charges. Broadhead&#x27;s friend and law partner, Alonzo W. Slayback, publicly defended Broadhead, asserting that the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; was nothing more than a &quot;blackmailing sheet&quot;. The next day, October 13, 1882, Cockerill re-ran an offensive &quot;card&quot; by John Glover that the paper had published the prior year (November 11, 1881). Incensed, Slayback barged into Cockerill&#x27;s offices at the paper demanding an apology. Cockerill shot and killed Slayback; he claimed self-defense, and a pistol was allegedly found on Slayback&#x27;s body. A grand jury refused to indict Cockerill for murder, but the economic consequences for the paper were severe. In May 1883, Pulitzer sent Cockerill to New York to manage the &quot;New York World&quot; for him.

The &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; was one of the first daily newspapers to print a comics section in color, on the back page of the features section, styled the &quot;Everyday Magazine.&quot;

===20th century===
At one time, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; had the second-largest news bureau in Washington, D.C., of any newspaper in the Midwestern United States.

After Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s retirement, generations of Pulitzers guided the newspaper, ending when great-grandson Joseph Pulitzer IV left the company in 1995.

The &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; was characterized by a liberal editorial page and columnists, including Marquis Childs. The editorial page was noted also for political cartoons by Daniel R. Fitzpatrick, who won the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartoons, and Bill Mauldin, who won the Pulitzer for editorial cartoons in 1959.

On May 22, 1946, the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; became the first newspaper in the world to publish the secret protocols for the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

During the presidency of Harry S. Truman, the paper was one of his most outspoken critics. It associated him with the Pendergast machine in Kansas City, and constantly attacked his integrity.

In 1950, the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; sent a reporter, Dent McSkimming, to Brazil to cover the 1950 FIFA World Cup. The reporter paid for his own travelling expenses and was the only U.S. reporter in all of Brazil covering the event.

In 1959 the &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot; entered into a joint operating agreement with the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot;. The Post–Globe operation merged advertising, printing functions and shared profits. The &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot;, distributed evenings, had a smaller circulation than the &quot;Globe-Democrat&quot;, a morning daily. The &quot;Globe-Democrat&quot; folded in 1983, leaving the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; as the only daily newspaper in the region.

In August 1973 a Teamsters union local representing &quot;Globe-Democrat&quot; and &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; staffers went on strike, halting production for six weeks.

===21st century===

In September 2003, the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; accepted submissions for a 63rd anniversary special of &quot;Our Own Oddities&quot;, a lighthearted feature that ran from 1940 to 1991. The best submissions, including a duck-shaped cucumber and a woman born on December 7, 1941, with the initials W.A.R., were illustrated by &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; artist Dan Martin and featured in the October 6, 2003, edition.

On January 13, 2004, the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; published a 125th-anniversary edition, which included some highlights of the paper&#x27;s 125 years:

* Coverage of Charles Lindbergh, who flew across the Atlantic despite being denied financial or written support from the &quot;Post-Dispatch.&quot;
* A Pulitzer Prize-winning campaign to clean up smoke pollution in St. Louis. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, the city had the filthiest air in the United States.
* Sports coverage, including nine St. Louis Cardinals championships, an NBA title by the St. Louis Hawks in 1958, and the 2000 Super Bowl victory of the St. Louis Rams.
* Coverage of the city&#x27;s &quot;cultural icons&quot; including Kate Chopin, Tennessee Williams, Chuck Berry, and Miles Davis.

On January 31, 2005, Michael Pulitzer announced the sale of Pulitzer, Inc. and all its assets, including the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; and a small share of the St. Louis Cardinals, to Lee Enterprises of Davenport, Iowa, for $1.46 billion. He said no family members would serve on the board of the merged company.

 the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; was the fifth-largest newspaper in the midwestern United States and the 26th-largest newspaper in the U.S.

On March 12, 2007, the paper eliminated 31 jobs, mostly in its circulation, classified phone rooms, production, purchasing, telephone operations and marketing departments. Several rounds of layoffs have followed.

On March 23, 2009, the paper converted to a compact style every day from the previous broadsheet Sunday through Friday and tabloid on Saturday.

On May 4, 2012, the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; named a new editor, Gilbert Bailon.

In 2015, the paper was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography for its coverage of protests in Ferguson, Missouri.

In September 2024, six newsroom employees were laid off. The following month the paper announced it will shutter its St. Louis press facility and outsource to a printer in Columbia, Missouri. In total, 72 employees will lose their jobs.

==Circulation and cost==
Circulation dropped for the daily paper from 213,472 to 191,631 and then 178,801 for the two years after 2010, ending on September 30, 2011, and September 30, 2012, respectively. The Sunday paper also decreased from 401,427 to 332,825 and then to 299,227. The circulation as of September 30, 2016, was 98,104 daily and 157,543 on Sunday.

According to a 2017 press release from Lee Enterprises, the paper reaches more than 792,600 readers each week and stltoday.com has roughly 67 million page views a month.

The paper sells for $3 daily or $4.25 on Sundays and Thanksgiving Day. The price may be higher outside adjacent counties and states. Sales tax is included at newsracks.

==Weatherbird==
On February 11, 1901, the paper introduced a front-page feature called the &quot;Weatherbird&quot;, a cartoon bird accompanying the daily weather forecast. &quot;Weatherbird&quot; is the oldest continuously published cartoon in the United States. Created by Harry B. Martin, who drew it through 1903, it has since been drawn by Oscar Chopin (1903–1910); S. Carlisle Martin (1910–1932); Amadee Wohlschlaeger (1932–1981); Albert Schweitzer, the first one to draw the Weatherbird in color (1981–1986); and Dan Martin (1986–present).

<doc id="345984" wikidata="Q247253" url="?curid=345984" title="Battle of Khe Sanh">
<text>The Battle of Khe Sanh (21 January – 9 July 1968) was conducted in the Khe Sanh area of northwestern Quảng Trị Province, Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), during the Vietnam War. The main US forces defending Khe Sanh Combat Base (KSCB) were two regiments of the United States Marine Corps supported by elements from the United States Army, the United States Air Force (USAF) and the RAAF, as well as a small number of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troops. These were pitted against two to three divisional-size elements of the North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN).

The US command in Saigon initially believed that combat operations around KSCB during 1967 were part of a series of minor PAVN offensives in the border regions, but when the PAVN was found to be moving major forces into the area, the U.S. force at KSCB was reinforced. On 21 January 1968, the PAVN surrounded and besieged the Marine base. In the ensuing five months, KSCB and the hilltop outposts around it were subjected to daily PAVN artillery, mortar, and rocket attacks, and several infantry assaults. More than 274 U.S. troops were killed and more than 2,500 wounded.

To support the Marine base, the USAF undertook Operation Niagara, a massive aerial bombardment campaign. In the first three months, over 114,810 tons of bombs were dropped by US &amp; allied aircraft and over 158,900 artillery rounds were fired in defense of the base. U.S forces lost one KC-130, three C-123 and 35 helicopters, while 23 aircraft and 123 helicopters were damaged. Throughout the campaign, US forces used the latest technology to locate and target PAVN forces, and logistical innovations to support the base.

In March 1968, a combined Marine–Army/ARVN task force launched an overland relief expedition (Operation Pegasus) that eventually broke through to the Marines at Khe Sanh.

American commanders considered the defense of Khe Sanh a success, but shortly after the siege was lifted, decided to dismantle the base rather than risk similar battles in the future. On 19 June 1968, the evacuation and destruction of KSCB began. Amid heavy shelling, the Marines attempted to salvage what they could before destroying what remained as they were evacuated. Minor attacks continued before the base was officially closed on 5 July. Marines remained around Hill 689, though, and fighting in the vicinity continued until 11 July until they were finally withdrawn, bringing the battle to a close.

In the aftermath, the North Vietnamese proclaimed a victory at Khe Sanh, while US forces claimed that they had withdrawn, as the base was no longer required. Historians have observed that the Battle of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the buildup of Viet Cong (VC) forces in the south before the early 1968 Tet Offensive. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General William Westmoreland, maintained that the true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.

== Prelude ==
The village of Khe Sanh was the seat of government of Hương Hoa district, an area of Bru Montagnard villages and coffee plantations about from the Laotian frontier on Route 9, the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam. The badly-deteriorated Route 9 ran from the coastal region through the western highlands and crossed the border into Laos. The origin of the combat base lay in the construction by US Army Special Forces of an airfield in August 1962 outside the village at an old French fort. The camp then became a Special Forces outpost of the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups, which were to keep watch on PAVN infiltration along the border and to protect the local population.
James Marino wrote that in 1964, General William Westmoreland, the US commander in Vietnam, had determined, &quot;Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base blocking enemy infiltration from Laos; a base for... operations to harass the enemy in Laos; an airstrip for reconnaissance to survey the Ho Chi Minh Trail; a western anchor for the defenses south of the DMZ; and an eventual jumping-off point for ground operations to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail.&quot; In November 1964, the Special Forces moved their camp to the Xom Cham Plateau, the future site of Khe Sanh Combat Base.

In the winter of 1964, Khe Sanh became the location of a launch site for the highly-classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group. The site was first established near the village and later moved to the French fort. From there, reconnaissance teams were launched into Laos to explore and gather intelligence on the PAVN logistical system known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail, also known as &quot;Truong Son Strategic Supply Route&quot; to the North Vietnamese soldiers.
Marino stated that &quot;by 1966, Westmoreland had begun to consider Khe Sanh as part of a larger strategy.&quot; With a view to gain the eventual approval for an advance through Laos to interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail, he determined that &quot;it was absolutely essential to hold the base.&quot; He gave the order for US Marines to take up positions around Khe Sanh. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, then began planning for incursion into Laos, and in October, the construction of an airfield at Khe Sanh was completed.

The plateau camp was permanently manned by the US Marines in 1967, when they established an outpost next to the airstrip. This base was to serve as the western anchor of Marine Corps forces, which had tactical responsibility for the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam known as I Corps. The Marines&#x27; defensive system stretched below the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from the coast, along Route 9, to Khe Sanh. In 1966, the regular Special Forces troops had moved off the plateau and built a smaller camp down Route 9 at Lang Vei, about half the distance to the Laotian border.

== Background ==
=== Border battles ===

During the second half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions in the border regions of South Vietnam. All of the attacks were conducted by regimental-size PAVN/VC units, but unlike most of the previous usual hit-and-run tactics, they were sustained and bloody affairs.

In early October, the PAVN had intensified battalion-sized ground probes and sustained artillery fire against Con Thien, a hilltop stronghold in the center of the Marines&#x27; defensive line south of the DMZ, in northern Quảng Trị Province. Mortar rounds, artillery shells, and 122 mm rockets fell randomly but incessantly upon the base. The September bombardments ranged from 100 to 150 rounds per day, with a maximum on 25 September of 1,190 rounds.

Westmoreland responded by launching Operation Neutralize, an aerial and naval bombardment campaign designed to break the siege. For seven weeks, American aircraft dropped between 35,000 and 40,000 tons of bombs in nearly 4,000 airstrikes.
On 27 October, a PAVN regiment attacked an Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) battalion at Song Be, capital of Phước Long Province. The PAVN fought for several days, took casualties, and fell back. Two days later, the PAVN 273rd Regiment attacked a Special Forces camp near the border town of Loc Ninh, in Bình Long Province. Troops of the US 1st Infantry Division were able to respond quickly. After a ten-day battle, the attackers were pushed back into Cambodia. At least 852 PAVN soldiers were killed during the action, as opposed to 50 American and South Vietnamese.

The heaviest action took place near Dak To, in the Central Highlands province of Kon Tum. The presence of the PAVN 1st Division prompted a 22-day battle there and had some of the most intense close-quarters fighting of the entire conflict. US intelligence estimated between 1,200 and 1,600 PAVN troops were killed, and 362 members of the US 4th Infantry Division, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and ARVN Airborne elements were killed in action, but three of the four battalions of the 4th Infantry and the entire 173rd were rendered combat-ineffective during the battle.

American intelligence analysts were quite baffled by the series of enemy actions. No logic was apparent to them behind the sustained PAVN/VC offensives other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. That was accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles, however, had two significant consequences, which were unappreciated at the time. They fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions, and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities in preparation for the Tet Offensive.

=== Hill fights ===
Things remained quiet in the Khe Sanh area through 1966. Even so, Westmoreland insisted for it not only to be occupied by the Marines but also for it to be reinforced. He was vociferously opposed by General Lewis W. Walt, the Marine commander of I Corps, who argued heatedly that the real target of the American effort should be the pacification and protection of the population, not chasing the PAVN/VC in the hinterlands.

Westmoreland won out, however, and the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment (1/3 Marines) was dispatched to occupy the camp and airstrip on 29 September. By late January 1967, the 1/3 returned to Japan and was relieved by Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9 Marines). A single company replaced an entire battalion.
On 24 April 1967, a patrol from Bravo Company became engaged with a PAVN force of an unknown size north of Hill 861. That action prematurely triggered a PAVN offensive aimed at taking Khe Sanh. The PAVN forces were in the process of gaining elevated terrain before it launched the main attack. The 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 3rd Marine Regiment, under the command of Colonel John P. Lanigan, reinforced KSCB and were given the task of pushing the PAVN off of Hills 861, 881 North, and 881 South. PAVN forces were driven out of the area around Khe Sanh after suffering 940 casualties. The Marines suffered 155 killed in action and 425 wounded. 

To prevent PAVN observation of the main base at the airfield and their possible use as firebases, the hills of the surrounding Khe Sanh Valley had to be continuously occupied and defended by separate Marine elements.

In the wake of the hill fights, a lull in PAVN activity occurred around Khe Sanh. By the end of May, Marine forces were again drawn down from two battalions to one, the 1st Battalion, 26th Marines. Lieutenant General Robert E. Cushman Jr. relieved Walt as commander of III MAF in June.

On 14 August, Colonel David E. Lownds took over as commander of the 26th Marine Regiment. Sporadic actions were taken in the vicinity during the late summer and early fall, the most serious of which was the ambush of a supply convoy on Route 9. That proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March. In December and early January, numerous sightings of PAVN troops and activities were made in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector remained relatively quiet.

=== Decisions ===
A decision then had to be made by the American high command to commit more of the limited manpower in I Corps to the defense of Khe Sanh or to abandon the base. Westmoreland regarded the choice as quite simple. In his memoirs, he listed the reasons for a continued effort:Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base for blocking enemy infiltration from Laos along Route 9; as a base for SOG operations to harass the enemy in Laos; as an airstrip for reconnaissance planes surveying the Ho Chi Minh Trail; as the western anchor for defenses south of the DMZ; and as an eventual jump-off point for ground operations to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail. 

Not all leading Marine officers, however, had the same opinion. Cushman, the new III MAF commander, supported Westmoreland perhaps because he wanted to mend Army/Marine relations after the departure of Walt. Other concerns raised included the assertion that the real danger to I Corps was from a direct threat to Quảng Trị City and other urban areas, a defense would be pointless as a threat to infiltration since PAVN troops could easily bypass Khe Sanh, the base was too isolated, and the Marines &quot;had neither the helicopter resources, the troops, nor the logistical bases for such operations.&quot; Additionally, Shore argued that the &quot;weather was another critical factor because the poor visibility and low overcasts attendant to the monsoon season made such operations hazardous.&quot;

Brigadier General Lowell English (assistant commander 3rd Marine Division) complained that the defense of the isolated outpost was ludicrous: &quot;When you&#x27;re at Khe Sanh, you&#x27;re not really anywhere. You could lose it and you really haven&#x27;t lost a damn thing.&quot;

As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all that he needed to know was that the PAVN had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the prospect even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area in which American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.

== Battle ==
=== Attacks on the perimeter ===
==== First skirmishes ====
In early December 1967, the PAVN appointed Major General Trần Quý Hai as the local commander for the actions around Khe Sanh, with Lê Quang Đạo as his political commissar. In the coming days, a campaign headquarters was established around Sap Lit. Two divisions, the 304th and the 325th, were assigned to the operation: the 325th was given responsibility for the area around the north, while the 304th was given responsibility for the southern sector. In attempting to determine PAVN intentions Marine intelligence confirmed that, within a period of just over a week, the 325th Division had moved into the vicinity of the base and two more divisions were within supporting distance. The 324th Division was located in the DMZ area north of Khe Sanh while the 320th Division was within easy reinforcing distance to the northeast. They were supported logistically from the nearby Ho Chi Minh Trail. As a result of this intelligence, KSCB was reinforced on 22 January 1968 by the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. According to the official PAVN history, by December 1967 the North Vietnamese had in place, or within supporting distance: the 304th, 320th, 324th and 325th Infantry Divisions, the independent 270th infantry Regiment; five artillery regiments (the 16th, 45th, 84th, 204th, and 675th); three AAA regiments (the 208th, 214th, and 228th); four tank companies; one engineer regiment plus one independent engineer battalion; one signal battalion; and a number of local force units.

At positions west of Hill 881 South and north of Co Roc Ridge (), across the border in Laos, the PAVN established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The PAVN 130 mm and 152 mm artillery pieces, and 122 mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105 mm and 155 mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the PAVN to avoid counter-battery fire. They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.

During the rainy night of 2 January 1968, six men dressed in black uniforms were seen outside the defensive wire of the main base by members of a listening post. After failing to respond to a challenge, they were fired upon and five were killed outright while the sixth, although wounded, escaped. This event prompted Cushman to reinforce Lownds with the rest of the 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines. This marked the first time that all three battalions of the 26th Marine Regiment had operated together in combat since the Battle of Iwo Jima during the Second World War. To cover a defilade near the Rao Quan River, four companies from 2/26 were immediately sent out to occupy Hill 558, with another manning Hill 861A.

On 20 January, La Thanh Ton, a PAVN lieutenant from the 325th Division, defected and laid out the plans for an entire series of PAVN attacks. Hills 881 South, 861, and the main base itself would be simultaneously attacked that same evening. At 00:30 on 21 January, Hill 861 was attacked by about 300 PAVN troops, the Marines, however, were prepared. The PAVN infantry, though bracketed by artillery fire, still managed to penetrate the perimeter of the defenses and were only driven back after severe close-quarters combat.

The main base was then subjected to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122-mm rockets slammed into the base, leveling most of the above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off an explosion in the main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown into the air and detonated on impact within the base. Soon after, another shell hit a cache of tear gas, which saturated the entire area. The fighting and shelling on 21 January resulted in 14 marines killed and 43 wounded. Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.

At the same time as the artillery bombardment at KSCB, an attack was launched against Khe Sanh village, seat of Hướng Hóa District. The village, 3 km south of the base, was defended by 160 local Bru troops, plus 15 American advisers. At dawn on 21 January, it was attacked by a roughly 300-strong PAVN battalion. A platoon from Company D, 1/26 Marines was sent from the base but was withdrawn in the face of the superior PAVN forces. Reinforcements from the ARVN 256th Regional Force (RF) company were dispatched aboard nine UH-1 helicopters of the 282nd Assault Helicopter Company, but they were landed near the abandoned French fort/former FOB-3 which was occupied by the PAVN who killed many of the RF troops and 4 Americans, including Lieutenant colonel Joseph Seymoe the deputy adviser for Quang Tri Province and forcing the remaining helicopters to abandon the mission. On the morning of 22 January Lownds decided to evacuate the remaining forces in the village with most of the Americans evacuated by helicopter while two advisers led the surviving local forces overland to the combat base.

To eliminate any threat to their flank, the PAVN attacked Laotian Battalion BV-33, located at Ban Houei Sane, on Route 9 in Laos. The battalion was assaulted on the night of 23 January by three PAVN battalions supported by seven tanks. The Laotians were overrun, and many fled to the Special Forces camp at Lang Vei. The Battle of Ban Houei Sane, not the attack three weeks later at Lang Vei, marked the first time that the PAVN had committed an armored unit to battle.

PAVN artillery fell on the main base for the first time on 21 January. Several rounds also landed on Hill 881. Due to the arrival of the 304th Division, KSCB was further reinforced by the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment on 22 January. Five days later, the final reinforcements arrived in the form of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion, which was deployed more for political than tactical reasons. The Marines and ARVN dug in and hoped that the approaching Tết truce (scheduled for 29–31 January) would provide some respite. On the afternoon of 29 January, however, the 3rd Marine Division notified Khe Sanh that the truce had been canceled. The Tet Offensive was about to begin.

==== Westmoreland&#x27;s plan to use nuclear weapons ====
Nine days before the Tet Offensive broke out, the PAVN opened the battle of Khe Sanh and attacked the US forces just south of the DMZ. Declassified documents show that in response, Westmoreland considered using nuclear weapons. In 1970, the Office of Air Force History published a then &quot;top secret&quot;, but now declassified, 106-page report, titled &quot;The Air Force in Southeast Asia: Toward a Bombing Halt, 1968&quot;. Journalist Richard Ehrlich writes that according to the report, &quot;in late January, General Westmoreland had warned that if the situation near the DMZ and at Khe Sanh worsened drastically, nuclear or chemical weapons might have to be used.&quot; The report continues to state, &quot;this prompted Air Force chief of staff, General John McConnell, to press, although unsuccessfully, for JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) authority to request Pacific Command to prepare a plan for using low-yield nuclear weapons to prevent a catastrophic loss of the U.S. Marine base.&quot;

Nevertheless, ultimately the nuclear option was discounted by military planners. A secret memorandum reported by US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, sent to US President Lyndon B. Johnson on 19 February 1968, was declassified in 2005. It reveals that the nuclear option was discounted because of terrain considerations that were unique to South Vietnam, which would have reduced the effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons. McNamara wrote: &quot;because of terrain and other conditions peculiar to our operations in South Vietnam, it is inconceivable that the use of nuclear weapons would be recommended there against either Viet Cong or North Vietnamese forces&quot;. McNamara&#x27;s thinking may have also been affected by his aide David Morrisroe, whose brother Michael Morrisroe was serving at the base.

==== Operation Niagara ====
During January, the recently installed electronic sensors of Operation Muscle Shoals (later renamed &quot;Igloo White&quot;), which were undergoing test and evaluation in southeastern Laos, were alerted by a flurry of PAVN activity along the Ho Chi Minh Trail opposite the northwestern corner of South Vietnam. Due to the nature of these activities, and the threat that they posed to KSCB, Westmoreland ordered Operation Niagara I, an intense intelligence collection effort on PAVN activities in the vicinity of the Khe Sanh Valley.
Niagara I was completed during the third week of January, and the next phase, Niagara II, was launched on the 21st, the day of the first PAVN artillery barrage. The Marine Direct Air Support Center (DASC), located at KSCB, was responsible for the coordination of air strikes with artillery fire. An airborne battlefield command and control center aboard a C-130 aircraft, directed incoming strike aircraft to forward air control (FAC) spotter planes, which, in turn directed them to targets either located by themselves or radioed in by ground units.} When weather conditions precluded FAC-directed strikes, the bombers were directed to their targets by either a Marine AN/TPQ-10 radar installation at KSCB or by Air Force Combat Skyspot MSQ-77 stations.

Thus began what was described by John Morocco as &quot;the most concentrated application of aerial firepower in the history of warfare&quot;. On an average day, 350 tactical fighter-bombers, 60 B-52s, and 30 light observation or reconnaissance aircraft operated in the skies near the base. Westmoreland had already ordered the nascent Igloo White operation to assist in the Marine defense. On 22 January, the first sensor drops took place, and by the end of the month, 316 acoustic and seismic sensors had been dropped in 44 strings. The sensors were implanted by a special naval squadron, Observation Squadron Sixty-Seven (VO-67). The Marines at KSCB credited 40% of intelligence available to their fire-support coordination center to the sensors.

By the end of the battle, USAF assets had flown 9,691 tactical sorties and dropped 14,223 tons of bombs on targets within the Khe Sanh area. Marine Corps aviators had flown 7,098 missions and released 17,015 tons. Naval aircrews, many of whom were redirected from Operation Rolling Thunder strikes against North Vietnam, flew 5,337 sorties and dropped 7,941 tons of ordnance in the area. Westmoreland later wrote, &quot;Washington so feared that some word of it might reach the press that I was told to desist, ironically answering what those consequences could be: a political disaster.&quot;

Meanwhile, an interservice political struggle took place in the headquarters at Phu Bai Combat Base, Saigon, and the Pentagon over who should control aviation assets supporting the entire American effort in Southeast Asia. Westmoreland had given his deputy commander for air operations, Air Force General William W. Momyer, the responsibility for coordinating all air assets during the operation to support KSCB. This caused problems for the Marine command, which possessed its own aviation squadrons that operated under their own close air support doctrine. The Marines were extremely reluctant to relinquish authority over their aircraft to an Air Force general. The command and control arrangement then in place in Southeast Asia went against Air Force doctrine, which was predicated on the single air manager concept. One headquarters would allocate and coordinate all air assets, distributing them wherever they were considered most necessary, and then transferring them as the situation required. The Marines, whose aircraft and doctrine were integral to their operations, were under no such centralized control. On 18 January, Westmoreland passed his request for Air Force control up the chain of command to CINCPAC in Honolulu.

Heated debate arose among Westmoreland, Commandant of the Marine Corps Leonard F. Chapman Jr., and Army Chief of Staff Harold K. Johnson. Johnson backed the Marine position due to his concern over protecting the Army&#x27;s air assets from Air Force co-option. Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed. As a result, on 7 March, for the first time during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager. Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion, including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.

==== Fall of Lang Vei ====

The Tet Offensive was launched prematurely in some areas on 30 January. On the following night, a massive wave of PAVN/VC attacks swept throughout South Vietnam, everywhere except Khe Sanh. The launching of the largest enemy offensive thus far in the conflict did not shift Westmoreland&#x27;s focus away from Khe Sanh. A press release prepared on the following day (but never issued), at the height of Tet, showed that he was not about to be distracted. &quot;The enemy is attempting to confuse the issue ... I suspect he is also trying to draw everyone&#x27;s attention away from the greatest area of threat, the northern part of I Corps. Let me caution everyone not to be confused.&quot;

Not much activity (with the exception of patrolling) had occurred thus far during the battle for the Special Forces Detachment A-101 and their four companies of Bru CIDGs stationed at Lang Vei. Then, on the morning of 6 February, the PAVN fired mortars into the Lang Vei compound, wounding eight Camp Strike Force soldiers. At 18:10 hours, the PAVN followed up their morning mortar attack with an artillery strike from 152 mm howitzers, firing 60 rounds into the camp. The strike wounded two more Strike Force soldiers and damaged two bunkers.

The situation changed radically during the early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of PAVN armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain. Although the PAVN was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it impossible for them to get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.

It still came as a shock to the Special Forces troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks attacked their camp. The Soviet-built PT-76 amphibious tanks of the 203rd Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, backed up by an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, tear gas, and flame throwers. Although the camp&#x27;s main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted for several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.

The Marines at Khe Sanh had a plan in place for providing a ground relief force in just such a contingency, but Lownds, fearing a PAVN ambush, refused to implement it. Lownds also rejected a proposal to launch a helicopter extraction of the survivors. During a meeting at Da Nang at 07:00 the next morning, Westmoreland and Cushman accepted Lownds&#x27; decision. Army Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Ladd (commander, 5th Special Forces Group), who had just flown in from Khe Sanh, was reportedly, &quot;astounded that the Marines, who prided themselves on leaving no man behind, were willing to write off all of the Green Berets and simply ignore the fall of Lang Vei.&quot;

Ladd and the commander of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to pick up any survivors. The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed. The relief effort was not launched until 15:00, and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.

Lownds infuriated the Special Forces personnel even further when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian refugees from the area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB. Lownds feared that PAVN infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position a short distance from the perimeter and from there, some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.

The Lao troops were eventually flown back to their homeland, but not before the Laotian regional commander remarked that his army had to &quot;consider the South Vietnamese as enemy because of their conduct.&quot; The Bru were excluded from evacuation from the highlands by an order from the ARVN I Corps commander, who ruled that no Bru be allowed to move into the lowlands. Ladd, back on the scene, reported that the Marines stated, &quot;they couldn&#x27;t trust any gooks in their damn camp.&quot; There had been a history of distrust between the Special Forces personnel and the Marines, and General Rathvon M. Tompkins, commander of the 3rd Marine Division, described the Special Forces soldiers as &quot;hopped up ... wretches ... [who] were a law unto themselves.&quot; At the end of January, Tompkins had ordered that no Marine patrols proceed more than 500 meters from the Combat Base. Regardless, the SOG reconnaissance teams kept patrolling, providing the only human intelligence available in the battle area. This, however, did not prevent the Marine tanks within the perimeter from training their guns on the SOG camp.

==== Logistics and supporting fire ====
Lownds estimated that the logistical requirements of KSCB were 60 tons per day in mid-January and rose to 185 tons per day when all five battalions were in place. The greatest impediments to the delivery of supplies to the base were the closure of Route 9 and the winter monsoon weather. For most of the battle, low-lying clouds and fog enclosed the area from early morning until around noon, and poor visibility severely hampered aerial resupply.

Making matters worse for the defenders, any aircraft that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to PAVN antiaircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of PAVN artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then had to contend with antiaircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65% of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the USAF, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System, in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The USAF delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.

The resupply of the numerous, isolated hill outposts was fraught with the same difficulties and dangers. The fire of PAVN antiaircraft units took its toll of helicopters that made the attempt. The Marines found a solution to the problem in the &quot;Super Gaggle&quot; concept. A group of 12 A-4 Skyhawk fighter-bombers provided flak suppression for massed flights of 12–16 helicopters, which would resupply the hills simultaneously. The adoption of this concept at the end of February was the turning point in the resupply effort. After its adoption, Marine helicopters flew in 465 tons of supplies during February. When the weather later cleared in March, the amount was increased to 40 tons per day.

As more infantry units had been assigned to defend KSCB, artillery reinforcement kept pace. By early January, the defenders could count on fire support from 46 artillery pieces of various calibers, five tanks armed with 90-mm guns, and 92 single or Ontos-mounted 106-mm recoilless rifles. The base could also depend on fire support from US Army 175-mm guns located at Camp Carroll, east of Khe Sanh. Throughout the battle, Marine artillerymen fired 158,891 mixed rounds. In addition, over 100,000 tons of bombs were dropped until mid-April by aircraft of the USAF, US Navy and Marines onto the area surrounding Khe Sanh. This equates to roughly 1,300 tons of bombs dropped daily – 5 tons for every one of the 20,000 PAVN soldiers initially estimated to have been committed to the fighting at Khe Sanh. Marine analysis of PAVN artillery fire estimated that the PAVN gunners had fired 10,908 artillery and mortar rounds and rockets into Marine positions during the battle.

Communications with military command outside of Khe Sanh was maintained by an U.S. Army Signal Corps team, the 544th Signal Detachment from the 337th Signal Company, 37th Signal Brigade in Danang. The latest microwave/tropospheric scatter technology enabled them to maintain communications at all times. The site linked to another microwave/tropo site in Huế manned by the 513th Signal Detachment. From the Huế site the communication signal was sent to Danang headquarters where it could be sent anywhere in the world. The microwave/tropo site was located in an underground bunker next to the airstrip.

==== Attacks prior to relief of the base ====
On the night of the fall of Lang Vei, three companies of the PAVN 101D Regiment moved into jump-off positions to attack Alpha-1, an outpost west of the Combat Base held by 66 men of Company A, 1st Platoon, 1/9 Marines. At 04:15 on 8 February under cover of fog and a mortar barrage, the PAVN penetrated the perimeter, overrunning most of the position and pushing the remaining 30 defenders into the southwestern portion of the defenses. For some unknown reason, the PAVN troops did not press their advantage and eliminate the pocket, instead throwing a steady stream of grenades at the Marines. At 07:40, a relief force from Company A, 2nd Platoon set out from the main base and attacked through the PAVN, pushing them into supporting tank and artillery fire. By 11:00, the battle was over, Company A had lost 24 dead and 27 wounded, while 150 PAVN bodies were found around the position, which was then abandoned.

On 23 February, KSCB received its worst bombardment of the entire battle. During one 8-hour period, the base was rocked by 1,307 rounds, most of which came from 130-mm (used for the first time on the battlefield) and 152-mm artillery pieces located in Laos. Casualties from the bombardment were 10 killed and 51 wounded. Two days later, US troops detected PAVN trenches running due north to within 25 m of the base perimeter. The majority of these were around the southern and southeastern corners of the perimeter, and formed part of a system that would be developed throughout the end of February and into March until they were ready to be used to launch an attack, providing cover for troops to advance to jumping-off points close to the perimeter. These tactics were reminiscent of those employed against the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, particularly in relation to entrenching tactics and artillery placement, and the realization assisted US planners in their targeting decisions.

Nevertheless, the same day that the trenches were detected, 25 February, 3rd Platoon from Bravo Company 1st Battalion, 26th Marines was ambushed on a short patrol outside the base&#x27;s perimeter to test the PAVN strength. The Marines pursued three enemy scouts, who led them into an ambush. The platoon withdrew following a three-hour battle that left six Marines dead, 24 missing, and one taken prisoner.


In late February, ground sensors detected the 66th Regiment, 304th Division preparing to mount an attack on the positions of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion on the eastern perimeter. On the night of 28 February, the combat base unleashed artillery and airstrikes on possible PAVN staging areas and routes of advance. At 21:30, the attack came on, but it was stifled by the small arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the PAVN finally withdrew. The PAVN, however, were not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during March.

By mid-March, Marine intelligence began to note an exodus of PAVN units from the Khe Sanh sector. The 325C Divisional Headquarters was the first to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west. At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did not mean, however, that battle was over. On 22 March, over 1,000 North Vietnamese rounds fell on the base, and once again, the ammunition dump was detonated.

On 30 March, Bravo Company, 26th Marines, launched an attack toward the location of the ambush that had claimed so many of their comrades on 25 February. Following a rolling barrage fired by nine artillery batteries, the Marine attack advanced through two PAVN trenchlines, but the Marines failed to locate the remains of the men of the ambushed patrol. The Marines claimed 115 PAVN killed, while their own casualties amounted to 10 dead, 100 wounded, and two missing. At 08:00 the following day, Operation Scotland was officially terminated. Operational control of the Khe Sanh area was handed over to the US Army&#x27;s 1st Air Cavalry Division for the duration of Operation Pegasus.

Cumulative friendly casualties for Operation Scotland, which began on 1 November 1967, were: 205 killed in action, 1,668 wounded, and 25 missing and presumed dead. These figures do not include casualties among Special Forces troops at Lang Vei, aircrews killed or missing in the area, or Marine replacements killed or wounded while entering or exiting the base aboard aircraft. As far as PAVN casualties were concerned, 1,602 bodies were counted, seven prisoners were taken, and two soldiers defected to allied forces during the operation. American intelligence estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 PAVN troops were killed during the operation, equating to up to 90% of the attacking 17,200-man PAVN force. The PAVN acknowledged 2,500 men killed in action. They also reported 1,436 wounded before mid-March, of which 484 men returned to their units, while 396 were sent up the Ho Chi Minh Trail to hospitals in the north.

==== President Johnson orders that the base be held at all costs ====
The fighting at Khe Sanh was so volatile that the Joint Chiefs and MACV commanders were uncertain that the base could be held by the Marines. In the US, the media following the battle drew comparisons with the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which proved disastrous for the French. Nevertheless, according to Tom Johnson, President Johnson was &quot;determined that Khe Sanh [would not] be an &#x27;American Dien Bien Phu&#x27;&quot;. He subsequently ordered the US military to hold Khe Sanh at all costs. As a result, &quot;B-52 Arc Light strikes originating in Guam, Okinawa, and Thailand bombed the jungles surrounding Khe Sanh into stubble fields&quot; and Khe Sanh became the major news headline coming out of Vietnam in late March 1968.

=== Relief of Khe Sanh ===
==== Operation Pegasus (1–14 April 1968) ====
Planning for the overland relief of Khe Sanh had begun as early as 25 January 1968, when Westmoreland ordered General John J. Tolson, commander, First Cavalry Division, to prepare a contingency plan. Route 9, the only practical overland route from the east, was impassable due to its poor state of repair and the presence of PAVN troops. Tolson was not happy with the assignment, since he believed that the best course of action, after Tet, was to use his division in an attack into the A Shau Valley. Westmoreland planned on Khe Sanh being relieved and then used as the jump-off point for a &quot;hot pursuit&quot; of enemy forces into Laos.

On 2 March, Tolson laid out what became known as Operation Pegasus, the operational plan for what was to become the largest operation launched by III MAF thus far in the conflict. The 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment (2/1 Marines) and the 2/3 Marines would launch a ground assault from Ca Lu Combat Base (16 km east of Khe Sanh) and head west on Route 9 while the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades of the 1st Cavalry Division, would air-assault key terrain features along Route 9 to establish fire support bases and cover the Marine advance. The advance would be supported by 102 pieces of artillery. The Marines would be accompanied by their 11th Engineer Battalion, which would repair the road as the advance moved forward. Later, the 1/1 Marines and 3rd ARVN Airborne Task Force (the 3rd, 6th, and 8th Airborne Battalions) would join the operation.

Westmoreland&#x27;s planned relief effort infuriated the Marines, who had not wanted to hold Khe Sanh in the first place and who had been roundly criticized for not defending it well. The Marines had constantly argued that technically, Khe Sanh had never been under siege, since it had never truly been isolated from resupply or reinforcement. Cushman was appalled by the &quot;implication of a rescue or breaking of the siege by outside forces&quot;.

Regardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began. Opposition from the North Vietnamese was light and the primary problem that hampered the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that slowed the pace of helicopter operations.

On 4 April 1/9 Marines sortied against Hill 471. With Company B protecting the perimeter at the rock quarry west of the combat base, the battalion moved to the line of departure at 02:30, finally leaving the positions it had defended for 73 days. At 06:00, the Marines attacked along the fog-shrouded Che Rien Ridge toward Hill 471, which lay two kilometers to the southeast. Following a lengthy artillery and air preparation, Company A assaulted the hill at 15:00. The defenders, a reinforced platoon of the 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment, put up a spirited fight, but Company A soon overwhelmed them, securing the hill at 16:00. The attack cost the battalion 10 dead and 56 wounded. The PAVN left 16 dead on the objective. Shortly after the Marines overran the hill, PAVN rocket fire began and by midnight, 192 rounds had fallen. At 04:30, two companies of the 66th Regiment assaulted Company C on the eastern half of the hill. Company A, located on the western side, was masked by the crest of the hill and could not fire in support. PAVN infantry swarmed up the slope firing rifles, sub-machine guns, and RPGs, while heavy machine guns pounded Company C&#x27;s positions. The PAVN advanced to within 20 meters of the Marine fighting holes, but Company C stood fast, with the help of almost 1,000 rounds of artillery fire from the 1st Battalion, 13th Marines. By 06:30, the PAVN attack was spent and they withdrew. At a cost of one Marine dead and 28 wounded, the 1/9 Marines killed over 140 North Vietnamese and captured five prisoners.

On 6 April, Company G, 2/26th Marines left Hill 558 in the early morning on the battalion&#x27;s first long distance patrol of the Khe Sanh battle. Its mission was to determine if the PAVN occupied the ridge which extended southeast from Hill 861. Just before noon, as the company reached the crest of the ridge, PAVN concealed in camouflaged, mutually supporting bunkers opened fire, cutting down several marines at point-blank range. Unable to advance into the heavy and accurate enemy fire, Company G suffered additional casualties as Marines tried to recover the fallen men nearest the enemy positions. Artillery and air support was called, but the number of aircraft available was limited and the artillery frequently entered a &quot;check fire&quot; status to allow for the safe passage of planes supporting other units. Because of these fire support coordination problems, the Marines could not overcome the stiff resistance atop the ridge. With six Marines missing in action, but presumed to be dead within the PAVN perimeter, Company G was ordered to withdraw to Hill 558 at nightfall &quot;as a result of regimental policy to recall units to the defensive positions for the night.&quot; In addition to the six missing, Company G lost four killed and 47 wounded and claimed 48 PAVN killed.

Also on 6 April 1/26th Marines attacked out of the combat base to the south, sending Company D against the PAVN bunker complex where 25 missing members of Company B had last been seen during operations on 25 February and 30 March. Company D recovered the remains of 21 Americans. The 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division clearing Route 9 in the area west of the 1st Marines, encountered a strong PAVN blocking position and fought a day-long battle which ended when the PAVN fled, leaving 83 dead. At noon, the men of 1/9 Marines became the first defenders of Khe Sanh relieved in Operation Pegasus when the 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry landed at Hill 471 and assumed responsibility for its defense. 1/9 Marines immediately attacked westward toward Hill 689. The ARVN 84th Company, 8th Airborne Battalion landed by helicopter at the base and linked up with the ARVN 37th Ranger Battalion.

On 7 April 2/26 Marines returned to the scene of the previous day&#x27;s ambush, this time with two companies, and cleared the ridge of PAVN, killing over 30 and recovering the bodies of the six missing Marines. 1/9 Marines continued the westward advance it had begun the previous afternoon, capturing Hill 552 with no resistance. The 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division captured the old French fort near Khe Sanh village after a three-day battle against a PAVN battalion.

The link-up between the relief force and the Marines at KSCB took place at 08:00 on 8 April, when the 
2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment entered the camp along the coffee plantation road. West of the base, 1/9 Marines advanced onto Hill 689 which had, for 11 weeks, dominated its position at the quarry. Steady and accurate PAVN mortar fire killed nine marines and wounded 27 during the battalion&#x27;s advance.

On 9 April no PAVN artillery fire hit the base and airdrops were suspended as the airfield was now open to all types of aircraft. The 11th Engineers proclaimed Route 9 open to traffic on 11 April. On that day, Tolson ordered his unit to immediately make preparations for Operation Delaware, an air assault into the A Shau Valley.

With patrols reporting PAVN units remaining on Hill 881 North, Colonel Bruce E. Meyers, the new commanding officer of the 26th Marines, ordered the 3/26th Marines to clear the hill, scene of the bitter fighting which had marked the beginning of the siege almost three months before and &quot;the last enemy position posing a threat to Khe Sanh.&quot; Unlike Company I&#x27;s reconnaissance in force of 20 January which was the last time U.S. forces had been near Hill 881 North, the attack planned for Easter Sunday, 14 April, called for the entire 3rd Battalion to take part. With the relief of the main base by the Army, Lieutenant colonel John C. Studt, who had assumed command of the 3rd Battalion the previous month, had consolidated his companies on Hill 881 South. Studt had expanded the area of operations to include &quot;Pork Chop Hill,&quot; the high ground immediately to the north, which the PAVN had vacated. With the order to take 881 North, Studt laid on a full menu of fire support, even lining up all eight of the battalion&#x27;s 106 mm recoilless rifles to support the assault. In addition to the howitzers and guns emplaced at the main base and Ca Lu, the battalion also had the support of the three 105 mm howitzers on Hill 881S. After nightfall on the 13th, the battalion prepared to mount the attack. Shortly after midnight, under the cover of darkness, all four companies accompanied by two scout dog teams moved along routes previously secured by patrols into assault positions in the &quot;saddle &quot; located between Hills 881 South and North. Studt left one platoon of Company I together with his H&amp;S Company on Hill 881 South. He had relieved Captain William H. Dabney and placed him in command of a battalion Provisional Weapons Company and rear security on Hill 881 South. Throughout the night Marine artillery and mortar shells crashed into Hill 881 North, destroying the PAVN&#x27;s bunkers and trenches, as Studt&#x27;s Marines waited for daybreak and the order to mount the final attack.

At about 05:30 on 14 April, following closely its artillery final preparation fires, the 3/26th Marines attacked with three companies abreast and the command group and one company in reserve close behind. Surging forward through a barren landscape of charred limbless trees and huge bomb craters, the battalion rolled up the PAVN&#x27;s defenses on the southern slope of the hill. Finally, with the crest of Hill 881 North before it, the battalion called for a massive artillery firing mission. When over 2,000 rounds of artillery fire had fallen on the objective, Company K attacked along the right flank rushing through the smoking debris of the PAVN defenses, rooting out the defenders from the ruins of bunkers and trenches. At 14:28, Company K raised a U.S. flag on the hill. The battalion lost six dead and 21 wounded. The Marines took two prisoners from the 8th Battalion, 29th Regiment, 325th Division and killed over 100 of the North Vietnamese troops. With the PAVN driven from the hill, the Marines began withdrawing to Hill 881 South.

At 08:00 on 15 April, Operation Pegasus was officially terminated. Total US casualties during the operation were 92 killed, 667 wounded, and five missing. Thirty-three ARVN troops were also killed and 187 were wounded. Because of the close proximity of the enemy and their high concentration, the massive B-52 bombings, tactical airstrikes, and vast use of artillery, PAVN casualties were estimated by MACV as being between 10,000 and 15,000 men.

Lownds and the 26th Marines departed Khe Sanh, leaving the defense of the base to the 1st Marine Regiment. He made his final appearance in the story of Khe Sanh on 23 May, when his regimental sergeant major and he stood before President Johnson and were presented with a Presidential Unit Citation on behalf of the 26th Marines.

==== Operation Scotland II ====

On 15 April, the 3rd Marine Division resumed responsibility for KSCB, Operation Pegasus ended, and Operation Scotland II began with the Marines seeking out the PAVN in the surrounding area. Operation Scotland II would continue until 28 February 1969 resulting in 435 marines and 3304 PAVN killed.

Author Peter Brush details that an &quot;additional 413 Marines were killed during Scotland II through the end of June 1968&quot;. He goes on to state that a further 72 were killed as part Operation Scotland II throughout the remainder of the year, but that these deaths are not included in the official US casualty lists for the Battle of Khe Sanh. Twenty-five USAF personnel who were killed are also not included.

==== Operation Charlie: evacuation of the base ====
The evacuation of Khe Sanh began on 19 June 1968 as Operation Charlie. Useful equipment was withdrawn or destroyed, and personnel were evacuated. A limited attack was made by a PAVN company on 1 July, falling on a company from the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, who were holding a position 3 km to the southeast of the base. Casualties were heavy among the attacking PAVN, who lost over 200 killed, while the defending Marines lost two men. The official closure of the base came on 5 July after fighting, which had killed five more Marines. The withdrawal of the last Marines under the cover of darkness was hampered by the shelling of a bridge along Route 9, which had to be repaired before the withdrawal could be completed.

Following the closure of the base, a small force of marines remained around Hill 689 carrying out mopping-up operations. Further fighting followed, resulting in the loss of another 11 marines and 89 PAVN soldiers, before the Marines finally withdrew from the area on 11 July. According to Brush, it was &quot;the only occasion in which Americans abandoned a major combat base due to enemy pressure&quot; and in the aftermath, the North Vietnamese began a strong propaganda campaign, seeking to exploit the US withdrawal and to promote the message that the withdrawal had not been by choice.

The PAVN claim that they began attacking the withdrawing Americans on 26 June 1968 prolonging the withdrawal, killing 1,300 Americans and shooting down 34 aircraft before &quot;liberating&quot; Khe Sanh on 15 July. The PAVN claim that during the entire battle they &quot;eliminated&quot; 17,000 enemy troops, including 13,000 Americans and destroyed 480 aircraft.

Regardless, the PAVN had gained control of a strategically important area, and its lines of communication extended further into South Vietnam. Once the news of the closure of KSCB was announced, the American media immediately raised questions about the reasoning behind its abandonment. They asked what had changed in six months so that American commanders were willing to abandon Khe Sanh in July. The explanations given out by the Saigon command were that &quot;the enemy had changed his tactics and reduced his forces; that PAVN had carved out new infiltration routes; that the Marines now had enough troops and helicopters to carry out mobile operations; that a fixed base was no longer necessary.&quot;

While KSCB was abandoned, the Marines continued to patrol the Khe Sanh plateau, including reoccupying the area with ARVN forces from 5–19 October 1968 with minimal opposition. On 31 December 1968, the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion was landed west of Khe Sanh to commence Operation Dawson River West, on 2 January 1969 the 9th Marines and 2nd ARVN Regiment were also deployed on the plateau supported by the newly established Fire Support Bases Geiger and Smith; the 3-week operation found no significant PAVN forces or supplies in the Khe Sanh area. From 12 June to 6 July 1969, &quot;Task Force Guadalcanal&quot; comprising 1/9 Marines, 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment and 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 2nd ARVN Regiment occupied the Khe Sanh area in Operation Utah Mesa. The Marines occupied Hill 950 overlooking the Khe Sanh plateau from 1966 until September 1969 when control was handed to the Army who used the position as a SOG operations and support base until it was overrun by the PAVN in June 1971. The gradual withdrawal of US forces began during 1969 and the adoption of Vietnamization meant that, by 1969, &quot;although limited tactical offensives abounded, US military participation in the war would soon be relegated to a defensive stance.&quot;

According to military historian Ronald Spector, to reasonably record the fighting at Khe Sanh as an American victory is impossible. With the abandonment of the base, according to Thomas Ricks, &quot;Khe Sanh became etched in the minds of many Americans as a symbol of the pointless sacrifice and muddled tactics that permeated a doomed U.S. war effort in Vietnam&quot;. Correspondent Michael Herr reported on the battle, and his account would inspire the surreal &quot;Do Long Bridge&quot; scene in the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, which emphasized the anarchy of the war.

== Aftermath ==
=== Termination of the McNamara Line ===
Commencing in 1966, the US had attempted to establish a barrier system across the DMZ to prevent infiltration by North Vietnamese troops. Known as the McNamara Line, it was initially codenamed &quot;Project Nine&quot;. It was later renamed &quot;Dye Marker&quot; by MACV in September 1967, just as the PAVN began the first phase of their offensive by launching attacks against Marine-held positions across the DMZ. The attacks hindered the advancement of the McNamara Line, and as the fighting around Khe Sanh intensified, vital equipment including sensors and other hardware had to be diverted from elsewhere to meet the needs of the US garrison at Khe Sanh. Construction on the line was ultimately abandoned and resources were later diverted towards implementing a more mobile strategy.

=== Assessment ===
The precise nature of Hanoi&#x27;s strategic goal at Khe Sanh is regarded as one of the most intriguing unanswered questions of the Vietnam War. According to Gordon Rottman, even the North Vietnamese official history, &quot;Victory in Vietnam&quot;, is largely silent on the issue. The question, known among American historians as the &quot;riddle of Khe Sanh,&quot; has been summed up by John Prados and Ray Stubbe: &quot;Either the Tet Offensive was a diversion intended to facilitate PAVN/VC preparations for a war-winning battle at Khe Sanh, or Khe Sanh was a diversion to mesmerize Westmoreland in the days before Tet.&quot; In assessing North Vietnamese intentions, Peter Brush cites the claim of Vietnamese theater commander, Võ Nguyên Giáp, &quot;that Khe Sanh itself was not of importance, but only a diversion to draw U.S. forces away from the populated areas of South Vietnam.&quot; That has led other observers to conclude that the siege served a wider PAVN strategy by diverting 30,000 US troops away from the cities that were the main targets of the Tet Offensive.

Whether the PAVN actually planned to capture Khe Sanh or the battle was an attempt to replicate the Việt Minh triumph against the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu has long been a point of contention. Westmoreland believed that the latter was the case, and his belief was the basis for his desire to stage &quot;Dien Bien Phu in reverse.&quot; Those who agree with Westmoreland reason that no other explanation exists for Hanoi to commit so many forces to the area instead of deploying them for the Tet Offensive. The fact that the North Vietnamese committed only about half of their available forces to the offensive (60–70,000), most of whom were Viet Cong, is cited in favor of Westmoreland&#x27;s argument. Other theories argued that the forces around Khe Sanh were simply a localized defensive measure in the DMZ area or that they were serving as a reserve in case of an offensive American end run in the mode of the American invasion at Inchon during the Korean War. However, North Vietnamese sources claim that the Americans did not win a victory at Khe Sanh but were forced to retreat to avoid destruction. The PAVN claimed that Khe Sanh was &quot;a stinging defeat from both the military and political points of view.&quot; Westmoreland was replaced two months after the end of the battle, and his successor explained the retreat in different ways.
General Creighton Abrams also suggested that the North Vietnamese may have been planning to emulate Dien Bien Phu. He believed that was proved by the PAVN&#x27;s actions during Tet. He cited the fact that it would have taken longer to dislodge the North Vietnamese at Hue if the PAVN had committed the three divisions at Khe Sanh to the battle there instead of dividing its forces. However, the PAVN committed three regiments to the fighting from the Khe Sanh sector.

Another interpretation was that the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle, a strategy that has come to be known as the Option Play. The PAVN would try to take Khe Sanh, but if could not, it would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as it could, which would facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured North Vietnamese study of the battle in 1974 that stated that the PAVN would have taken Khe Sanh if it could have done so, but there was a limit to the price that it would pay. Its main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.

Another theory is that the actions around Khe Sanh and the other battles at the border were simply feints and ruse meant to focus American attention and forces on the border. A historian, General Dave Palmer, accepted that rationale: &quot;General Giap never had any intention of capturing Khe Sanh ... [it] was a feint, a diversionary effort. And it had accomplished its purpose magnificently.&quot;

Marine General Rathvon M. Tompkins, the commander of the 3rd Marine Division, pointed out that had the PAVN actually intended to take Khe Sanh, PAVN troops could have cut the base&#x27;s sole source of water, a stream 500 m outside the perimeter of the base. If only it had contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines. Also, Marine Lieutenant General Victor Krulak seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the PAVN.
One argument that was then leveled by Westmoreland and has since often quoted by historians of the battle is that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh, compared with the several PAVN divisions. When Hanoi made the decision to move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only one or two American battalions. Whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four PAVN divisions was debatable. However, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops, nearly 50 maneuver battalions, to I Corps.

=== Use during Operation Lam Son 719 ===
On 30 January 1971, the ARVN and US forces launched Operation Dewey Canyon II, which involved the reopening of Route 9, securing the Khe Sanh area and reoccupying of KSCB as a forward supply base for Operation Lam Son 719. On 8 February 1971, the leading ARVN units marched along Route 9 into southern Laos while the US ground forces and advisers were prohibited from entering Laos. American logistical, aerial, and artillery support was provided to the operation.

After the ARVN defeat in Laos, the newly-reopened KSCB came under attack by PAVN sappers and artillery and the base was abandoned once again on 6 April 1971.

Fann Woon Fong (born 27 January 1971), known professionally as Fann Wong, is a Singaporean actress, singer, businesswoman and model. She has been referred to as one of MediaCorp&#x27;s &quot;Ah Jie&quot; for being one of the most successful actresses from Singapore.

At the local Star Awards 1995, Fann became the first actress to snag three prominent awards in the same year: Best Actress, Best Newcomer and Top 5 Most Popular Female Artiste. After gaining regional exposure and popularity in Asia through film and television productions, she became the first Singaporean actress to break into Hollywood, playing Chon Lin in the 2003 film &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot;. She married actor Christopher Lee on 29 September 2009.

==Early life==
Born in Singapore to Hakka tailor parents, Fann Chin Khew and Wong Siew Toy, Fann Wong would later derived her English stage name from her parents&#x27; surnames. Fann has three siblings — an older sister, as well as a younger brother and a younger sister named Fan Wen Qing (former child actress). She was educated at Temasek Secondary School, where she took her GCE &#x27;O&#x27; Level examinations in 1987.

Fann was a child actor while in primary school and featured in several SBC children&#x27;s programmes. At the age of 16, she won a beauty contest organised by &quot;Her World&quot;, a Singapore fashion magazine. She started a successful modelling career in Singapore, and spent the next two years modelling part-time while taking her GCE &#x27;A&#x27; Level examinations at a private school. She subsequently earned a diploma in fashion merchandising from LaSalle International Fashion School in Singapore.

==Career==
Fann moved to Taiwan in 1993. One of her earliest successes was in an Oil of Ulan (now Oil of Olay) commercial aired in Taiwan and Singapore. The following year, a Singaporean television producer discovered her and cast her in &quot;Dreams Come True&quot;, a Singapore drama series. Fann soon starred in two more Singapore television series, &quot;The Challenger&quot; and &quot;Chronicle of Life&quot;.

After a year in the Singapore television industry, her role in &quot;Chronicle of Life&quot; won her Best Actress and Best Newcomer awards at Singapore&#x27;s 1995 Star Awards. In 1996, her role in &quot;The Unbroken Cycle&quot; won her first regional nomination at the Asian Television Awards. She continued to star in a large array of drama serials, including &quot;A Romance in Shanghai&quot; (produced in Shanghai), &quot;Wild Orchids&quot; (filmed in Sydney) and &quot;Brave New World&quot; (filmed in Amsterdam and Belgium).

In late 1996, Fann released in Singapore her first Mandarin pop album &quot;Fanntasy&quot;, which contained a duet (theme song of her TV drama &#x27;Brave New World&#x27;) with Taiwanese singer Jeff Chang. The album was retitled &quot;I Live Alone&quot; and repackaged with two additional songs for the Taiwanese market and won 4 IFPI platinum sales awards in Taiwan, marking the start of Fann&#x27;s regional success.

===Late 1990s: rise of regional popularity===

In 1996, Fann starred in the 40-episode blockbuster drama &quot;Brave New World&quot; alongside Christopher Lee and Hong Kong actor Alex Man. This was the first time ever that Fann would act together with Christopher Lee. Fann also performed the theme song, &quot;Don&#x27;t let love become hard for us&quot;, as a duet with Taiwanese singer Jeff Chang.

In 1998, Fann was named the female lead, Xiaolongnü, in TCS remake of the hit wuxia drama &quot;The Return of the Condor Heroes&quot; where she once again starred alongside Christopher Lee. The release of this drama, along with her second album, &quot;Shopping&quot;, further increased her exposure in Taiwan and China. When Hong Kong director Derek Yee saw Fann&#x27;s &quot;Shopping&quot; music video on Hong Kong&#x27;s Channel V, he flew to Singapore to cast her as the lead actress in the Hong Kong art film &quot;The Truth About Jane and Sam&quot;. The movie topped the Singapore box office for three weeks and her role as a gritty wild-child won her a Best New Performer nomination at the 19th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2000. In addition, her role as a self-centred stockbroker in &quot;Out to Win&quot; attracted a million viewers in Singapore during its finale. It was during this period when Fann acquired many of her die-hard fans, led by the Fann-atic Fan Club (FFC).

In 1999, Fann released her third album, &quot;Missing You&quot;, recorded &quot;Private Number&quot; with British boyband 911 and performed &quot;Moments of Magic&quot;, Singapore&#x27;s official millennium song. These musical successes resulted in her being the first Singapore artiste to stage a solo paying concert (&quot;My Story&quot;—Fann Wong in Concert) at the Singapore Indoor Stadium in 2000. That same year, she released her fourth Mandarin album, &quot;No Problem&quot;.

During the next few years, Fann focused on her acting career. She played a two-timing television reporter in the omnibus Hong Kong film &quot;When I Fall in Love... With Both&quot;, acted as a lovelorn insurance agent in the Singaporean romantic drama &quot;Looking For Stars&quot;, as well as played the title character in the Taiwanese period drama &quot;Madam White Snake&quot;. She also began hosting travelogue shows, including &quot;Travel Hunt: Japan&quot; and &quot;Fann Adventure&quot;, which was filmed in South Africa and Malaysia.

===2003: Hollywood===
In 2002, Fann became the first Singaporean actress to play a major role in a Hollywood production, as Chon Lin in &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot;. When the film was released in early 2003, Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated:
Fann is an enchanting new film presence. Clearly modelled after Zhang Ziyi of &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, she combines a dancer&#x27;s grace with a fighter&#x27;s speed, and looks great standing still or whirling.
&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s David Hunter noted that Fann was &quot;more than equal to playing the strong woman fighter who&#x27;s also pretty darn cute&quot;, while John Keenan of the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot; stated that &quot;Fann&#x27;s stunt work is actually more memorable than Jackie Chan&#x27;s here&quot;. In Hong Kong, the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; stated that she &quot;seems set to displace Lucy Liu as Hollywood&#x27;s Asian babe du jour&quot;. She was subsequently nominated under the Best Fight category in MTV Movie Awards 2003, and in 2004, won the Singapore Street Festival&#x27;s Best International Artiste Award.

===2004–2007===
In 2004, Fann continued acting in China period dramas such as &quot;Moon Fairy&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. She also starred in a Singapore serial on the SARS epidemic titled &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;, which won her a Best Actress nomination at the 2004 Star Awards. In mid-2004, Fann was cast in the lead role in the German-Singapore telemovie, &quot;House of Harmony&quot;. In late 2004, Fann released her first publication, a semi-autobiographical comic book &quot;Girl Illustrated&quot;. After a musical hiatus of five years, she released her first compilation, &quot;In Love With You&quot;.

In April 2005, Fann was invited to the Cannes MIPTV Media Market where she promoted &quot;House of Harmony&quot; and discussed possible collaborations with European industry professionals. She obtained the All-Time Favourite Artiste for obtaining the Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes .
 &quot;House of Harmony&quot; has since been telecast in Germany, Austria, France and Belgium to a combined prime-time viewership of over 80 million. That same year, Fann took on a lead role in a Taiwanese art-house romance film, &quot;Dragon Eye Congee&quot;, which was nominated for five categories at the inaugural Asian Festival of First Films.

In August 2005, she made her voiceover debut in Singapore&#x27;s first 3D animation film, &quot;Zodiac, The Race Begins&quot;, which was released in early 2006. Furthermore, she also contributed her songs for the soundtracks of the movie.

In November 2006, Fann made her first promotional visit to Phnom Penh, Cambodia. She performed at the Tonle Sap Water Festival Mega Concert and visited the Krousar Thmey blind school, where she donated cassette recorders and biscuits.

===2007–2012: Focus on the Chinese market===
In early 2007, Fann signed a management contract with China&#x27;s Huayi Brothers. Fann also became the first Singaporean artist to release a self-illustrated 3D animation, titled &quot;Fanntasy World&quot;. The release of her Singapore film &quot;Just Follow Law&quot;, in which she had to play an uncouth and scruffy man in a woman&#x27;s body, was a major attraction at the Chinese New Year box office and won her critical acclaim in the Singapore and Malaysian media.

In 2008, she was invited to be a judge at the sixth &quot;spirit of fire&quot; international film festival which was held in Russia. &quot;Ah Long Pte Ltd&quot; reached No. 1 in both Singapore&#x27;s and Malaysia&#x27;s box office during the Chinese new year. Later, the film &quot;Dance of Dragon&quot; that she paired with Korean hunk Jang Hyuk led her to win her first International Best Actress at West Hollywood International Film Festival.

In 2009, Fann starred with future husband Christopher Lee in &quot;The Wedding Game&quot;. The movie won the best feature film at the first international comedy film festival held in Thailand. In June, she finished her new Chinese movie &quot;In a tangle&quot; . In September, she filmed the romantic movie &quot;Cornflower blue&quot;, starring with Alex Fong and Chang Chen in Hainan. Both of them were on the screen in late 2010. She filmed another comedy film &quot;Happy Go Lucky&quot;, which was shown during the Chinese New Year.

In 2010, she slowed down her pace and only two dramas were filmed. But she gained her critic praises from many Chinese media for her character &quot;Ren DaiDai&quot; in the drama &quot;Jin DaBan De Zuihou Yiye&quot; starring with Chinese actress Fan Bingbing. Two more Singaporean dramas followed in 2011.

But 2012 seemed to be a busy year for Fann. At the begin of the year, she played a syren in the series &quot;The Legend of Master Ji 3&quot;, then she was invited to be a judge for TBS&#x27;s fashion competition show &quot;Asian Ace&quot;. Later she flew to ShanDong and played a spicy wife in the movie &quot;Ai Shui Shui&quot; together with Jaycee Chan, and also a telemovie &quot;Han di hu lue zhu gui&quot; based on novel Water Margin. Another movie &quot;Runaway Woman&quot; was filmed in Xinjiang in May. She was awarded the &quot;2012 Huading Most Popular Asian Actress Award&quot; in Beijing Olympic Sports Centre on 4 July. Though she didn&#x27;t release new album for years, she was still invited to perform at 9th Asia Song Festival which was held in Yeosul, Korea, on 4 August. In October, she flew to Xinjiang again to film the period drama &quot;Tun Shu Xi Jiang&quot; about revolution occurring in Xinjiang. She worked with Hong Kong actor Bowie Lam (her husband in the drama) and Chinese director Zhang Jizhong.

===2013-2014: New Beginnings===
2013 marked a new career beginning for Fann. She set up her own studio at the end of 2012, ended her contract with Huayi Brothers, and signed a new contract with Taiwan management agency Catwalk.

In 2014, after working with Fann on a children&#x27;s charity in Thailand, illustrator Patrick Yee designed and illustrated a nearly wordless picturebook, published by Epigram Books, about the adventures of a girl with the same name.

===2014–present: Focus on Motherhood===

After giving birth to her son Zed in 2014, Fann took a step back in her career to focus on motherhood, only taking on acting projects occasionally.

In 2018, Fann made her acting comeback in Doppelganger (TV series), which marked her first on-screen collaboration with husband Christopher Lee in almost 14 years. The role scored her a nomination for Star Awards for Best Actress at Star Awards 2019.

In 2020, Fann made her Mediacorp English drama debut in the Hokkien opera themed series, &quot;Titoudao: Inspired by a True Wayang Star&quot;. That same year, Fann turned down an invitation from Zhang Ziyi to appear in the popular Chinese variety show, I Am the Actor.

In 2023, Fann was in negotiations to appear in the fourth season of the popular Chinese reality TV show Sisters Who Make Waves. Fann ultimately did not appear in the show.

In 2024, Fann was featured in a women-focused exhibition, Goddess: Brave. Bold. Beautiful, at the ArtScience Museum alongside Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi and Marilyn Monroe. 

==Personal life==
Fann has been romantically involved with Malaysian actor Christopher Lee since late 2002. They went public with their relationship in mid-2005. She had only one prior romance known to the public: an 11-year relationship with businessman Anthony Chan.

Fann and Lee have collaborated eight times in television productions and have played lovers in six of these. After publicly acknowledging their relationship in mid-2005, they were seldom seen together. However, in December 2006, they walked together hand-in-hand down the blue carpet of the 2006 Star Awards ceremony. The gesture was noted by the Singapore media as a rare public acknowledgement of their relationship. 
In September 2008, it was rumoured she would be marrying Lee. They were married on 16 May 2009. Costing at , their wedding was featured in an infotainment show called &quot;The Wedding&quot; (范心有李), which was hosted by Michelle Chong, Mark Lee, and Dennis Chew. On 9 August 2014, Fann gave birth to a son named Zed.

In July 2020, Fann alerted her fans to a scammer using her identity to get her fans&#x27; personal information. The scam asked fans to register their names on a website in order to receive a giveaway prize.

On 5 July 2021, Fann&#x27;s father died at the age of 81.

On 13 October 2021, Fann opened her online pastry shop called &quot;Fanntasy&quot;.

Fann&#x27;s hobbies include illustrating comics, shopping, and eating.

<doc id="345995" wikidata="Q2359610" url="?curid=345995" title="Hawkman">
<text>Hawkman is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, the original Hawkman first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1, published by All-American Publications in 1940.

Although iterations of Hawkman appeared throughout the character&#x27;s publication history, they are commonly characterized as hawk-themed warriors with a preference for archaic weaponry, large wings with a harness attached to it, and possessing Nth metal, which is a special metal with gravity-negating effects. Most iterations are also connected as being involved in a cycle of reincarnation, characterized as sometimes having reoccurring elements within their lifetimes. Among the reoccurring includes a romantic connection to reincarnated Hawkwoman or Hawkgirl and an affiliation with superhero teams such as the Justice Society of America and Justice League, often serving as the team leader in the former. 

The character is often depicted as either the human archaeologist Carter Hall, the modern-day reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian prince named Khufu, or as Thanagarian police officer Katar Hol. Both iterations of the character, at times, interchangeably used the names of one another. The 2019 &quot;Hawkman&quot; series reconciles the character&#x27;s histories, revealing the original Hawkman to be Ktar Deathbringer, an alien murderer who was cursed to atone for his crimes by saving as many people as killed. The series reveals that the curse reincarnates the character across time and space, occasionally allowing multiple incarnations to coexist.

The character has been adapted into other media numerous times, with significant appearances in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, which featured Hawkgirl as a main character, as well as several DC Universe Original Animated Movies. In live action, the character first appeared onscreen in the two-part 1979 TV special &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot;, portrayed by Bill Nuckols. Hawkman was later portrayed by Michael Shanks in &quot;Smallville&quot; and by Falk Hentschel in The CW&#x27;s Arrowverse series, with both versions favoring the ancient Egyptian version of the character. 
==Publication history==
Hawkman first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (1940), and was a featured character in that title throughout the 1940s. This Hawkman was Carter Hall, a reincarnation of the ancient Egyptian prince Khufu. Hall discovered that the mysterious &quot;ninth metal&quot; (later changed simply to &quot;Nth metal&quot;) could negate the effects of gravity and allow him to fly. He donned a costume with large wings to allow him to control his flight and became the crimefighter, Hawkman. He also had a companion hawk named Big Red that assisted him in fighting crime. An archaeologist by profession, Hall used ancient weapons from the museum that he curated.
Hawkman was a charter member of the Justice Society of America, beginning with &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #3 (Winter 1940). In issue #8 he became the JSA&#x27;s chairman, a position he held until the end of the JSA&#x27;s run in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; in 1951. He was the only member of the JSA to appear in every adventure during the Golden Age of Comic Books. He romanced his reincarnated bride, Shiera Saunders, who became the crimefighter Hawkgirl. His first three adventures were drawn by creator Dennis Neville (who modeled Hawkman&#x27;s costume on the hawkmen characters in the Flash Gordon comic strip by Alex Raymond), then by Sheldon Moldoff, and later by Joe Kubert, who slightly redesigned his mask in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; # 85 (Jul 1947) and then, one year later, replaced the winged-hawk-like mask with a much simpler yellow cowl in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #98 (Aug 1948).

Along with most other superheroes, Hawkman&#x27;s Golden Age adventures came to an end when the industry turned away from the genre in the early 1950s. His last appearance was in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #57 (1951).

Later in the decade, DC Comics, under editor Julius Schwartz, decided to revive a number of heroes in new incarnations, but retaining the same names and powers. Following the success of the Flash and Green Lantern, the name &quot;Hawkman&quot; was revived in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; # 34 (Feb–Mar 1961), this time as an alien police officer from the planet Thanagar, though his powers were largely the same. Created by Gardner Fox and Joe Kubert, this Hawkman named Katar Hol came to Earth with his wife Shayera in pursuit of a criminal, and decided to remain on Earth to study earth police methods as well as fight crime. They adopted the names Carter and Shiera Hall and became curators of a museum in Midway City.

This Hawkman became a member of the Justice League of America in issue #31, where he often verbally sparred with the iconoclastic liberal hero Green Arrow. In the 1960s, it was revealed that the original Hawkman lived on the parallel world of Earth-Two, and that Katar Hol lived on Earth-One. The JLA and JSA had an annual meeting throughout the 1960s and 1970s during which the two heroes often met.
The Silver Age Hawkman had his own series for a few years in the &#x27;60s, but with declining sales it ended at issue #27 and was then merged with that of the Atom. &quot;Atom and Hawkman&quot; lasted only another year or so before cancellation.

In the late 1970s in &quot;Showcase&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;, Thanagar went to war with the planet Rann, the adopted home of Adam Strange. This led to Hawkman and Hawkwoman severing ties with their homeworld, and later fighting &quot;The Shadow War of Hawkman&quot; (written by Tony Isabella) as the Thanagarians tried secretly to conquer the Earth.

The landmark 1985 series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; resulted in a massive revision of much of DC continuity and led to many characters being substantially rewritten. Hawkman was to suffer some of the greatest confusion as successive writers sought to explain his various appearances. In the revised timeline there was a single Earth which had witnessed the JSA in the 1940s and the JLA decades later. Successive revisions sought to establish exactly who had been Hawkman and Hawkwoman at different stages. For the first few years the pre-Crisis incarnations were still used, during which time they were prominent across the DC Universe and joined the latest incarnation of the Justice League.

DC decided to reboot Hawkman, in a limited series (which later led to an ongoing series) titled &quot;Hawkworld&quot; originally by Timothy Truman, and later John Ostrander. In this series, Thanagar was a stratified society which conquered other worlds to enrich itself. Katar Hol was the son of a prominent official who rebelled against the status quo. He and his partner Shayera were sent to Earth and remained there for some years until Hol was apparently killed.

This created several continuity errors. Because the new Katar Hol had only just arrived on Earth, someone else had to have been Hawkman previously. In an attempt to resolve the problem it was established through retcons that the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl had continued to operate sporadically after their supposed retirement in 1951 through the 1990s, and that Nth metal originally came from Thanagar. The Halls, and not the Hols, joined the original incarnation of the JLA. Another Hawkman—Fel Andar, a Thanagarian agent—had been the one who joined the Justice League during the 1980s, pretending to be a hero but secretly spying on the League for his Thanagarian masters.

The &quot;Zero Hour&quot; miniseries muddied the waters further by merging the different Hawkmen into a &quot;Hawkgod&quot;, who was the focus character in the third volume of the monthly &quot;Hawkman&quot; series. This version of Hawkman also had a small role in the alternate-future series &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. After the end of this series, Hawkman&#x27;s continuity was considered by DC to be too complicated, and he was absent from comics for several years.

In the late 1990s, the &quot;JSA&quot; series untangled Hawkman&#x27;s continuity, establishing him as Carter Hall, a man who—along with Shiera—had been reincarnated dozens of times since his life in ancient Egypt, and whose powers were derived from Thanagarian Nth metal, which had been retroactively renamed from &quot;ninth metal&quot;. The Katar Hol of the &quot;Hawkworld&quot; series had also come to Earth during the 1990s, as previously established. The 1980s Hawkman Fel Andar returned to Thanagar. The Hawkgod was later revealed to be an avatar of the Hawk aspect of the Red (from which Animal Man receives his powers) and only believed that he was Hawkman.

During the &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; miniseries, it was established that Hawkman (Carter Hall) had encouraged the mindwipe of Doctor Light and had actually been the one to initially suggest the idea. His role in the mindwipe was the basis for his enmity with Green Arrow, who felt that interfering with an individual&#x27;s right to self-determination was beyond the moral right of any organization or government.

Subsequently, Hawkman was reincarnated and given a new series in 2002 entitled &quot;Hawkman&quot; vol. 4, written initially by James Robinson and Geoff Johns, with art by Rags Morales. Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti took over writing duties during the third year of the series. In 2006, the series was retitled &quot;Hawkgirl&quot; with issue #50 and given a new creative team of Walt Simonson and Howard Chaykin. This series was cancelled with issue #66 in July 2007.

Hawkman was a major character in the &quot;Rann–Thanagar War&quot; miniseries, which stemmed from events in &quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot;. During this time, his continuity was further changed.

The character then received a new series spinning out of &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot;, helmed by Robert Venditti and Bryan Hitch.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Carter Hall===
In the days of ancient Egypt, Prince Khufu is engaged in a feud with his rival, the Egyptian priest Hath-Set. The priest eventually captures both Khufu and his consort Chay-Ara, and kills them using a cursed dagger of Nth metal. Millennia later, in 1940, Khufu is reincarnated as American archaeologist Carter Hall, Chay-Ara as Shiera Saunders, and Hath-Set as scientist Anton Hastor. After touching the same Nth Metal dagger used to kill Khufu, Carter regains the memories of his former life and realizes Hastor is the reincarnation of his ancient foe. When Hastor kidnaps Shiera, using a magic spell to draw her to his lair, Hall uses his newly-refound memories to craft a gravity-defying belt using Nth metal and a winged costume to become Hawkman. Carter successfully rescues Shiera, Anton is killed by electrocution, and Carter and Saunders begin a romantic relationship.

Carter Hall and Shiera Saunders had a son together, named Hector Hall, who grew up to also have a superheroic identity as Silver Scarab and later adopted the mantle of Dr. Fate. Hector Hall was a member of the superhero groups Infinity Inc. and the JSA, where he served alongside his father.

===Katar Hol===
Katar Hol is an honored police officer on his homeworld of Thanagar. Along with his wife Shayera, they use the anti-gravity belts and their wings to fly and fight criminals. These were the tools of an elite police unit tasked to track and apprehend the most dangerous criminals. The pair were sent to Earth in 1961 to capture the shapeshifting criminal Byth Rok. Following this mission, they elected to remain on Earth to work with authorities in the United States and learn human police methods. The two adopted covers as a pair of museum curators, Carter and Shiera Hall, and acted publicly as the second Hawkman and the second Hawkgirl (later Hawkwoman).

Although initially depicted as surviving the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; intact, Katar Hol was rebooted just a few years afterwards in a prestige-format miniseries named &quot;Hawkworld&quot;, by Timothy Truman. A regular ongoing series of the same name followed, with writer John Ostrander joining Truman. Katar Hol, a young police officer on the planet Thanagar, rebels against the oppressive system of his planet and is sent into exile. He later escapes and uncovers a renegade police captain Byth. As a result, he is reinstated into the force, given a new partner, Shayera Thal, and sent on a mission on Earth, where he is the third Hawkman.

In DC&#x27;s The New 52 universe, Hawkman is Katar Hol but uses the name Carter Hall.

===Fel Andar===
Late in the 1980s, Thanagarian spy Fel Andar—who had been living on Earth for some time already—fell in love with an Earth woman, Sharon Parker, and they had a son named Charley. Andar was ordered by the Thanagarian government to infiltrate the Justice League and Parker&#x27;s memories were altered so that she believed she was Hawkwoman and believed that her son was &quot;Carter Hall Jr.&quot; instead of Andar&#x27;s son. Charley Andar later took up the name Hawkman to honor his &quot;father&quot; whom he believed to be Carter Hall. When Parker&#x27;s old memories surface, she exposed Andar&#x27;s infiltration plot; Andar murdered her and fled to Thanagar. Andar later returned to Earth to help his son become the hero Golden Eagle, and saved his life once before being recaptured and returned to Thanagar.

===Zauriel===
When Grant Morrison revived the &quot;JLA&quot; comic book in 1997, they expanded the roster to include over a dozen heroes. With frequent collaborator Mark Millar, they intended to create a new Hawkman with no links to the old characters. This new Hawkman, an Earth-bound angel of the &quot;Eagle host&quot; named Zauriel, was to be introduced into the JLA with issue #6 (June 1997). Morrison was denied permission to use the name &quot;Hawkman&quot; by DC editorial, which still considered it &quot;radioactive&quot;, due to the complex post-Crisis continuity problems with the character.

In the &quot;Wizard JLA Special&quot;, Morrison made an appeal to the fanbase, &quot;It&#x27;s a good name and it seems a shame to let it go to waste. We&#x27;re hoping that fans will figure &#x27;For God&#x27;s sake, let&#x27;s just call him Hawkman and get him in the Justice League as Hawkman,&#x27; and the editors will relent. We&#x27;re hoping to start a campaign.&quot; DC held firm, and the &quot;Hawkman&quot; name went unused for several more years.

===Charley Parker===
Originally the Teen Titans member called Golden Eagle, Charley Parker was presumed deceased after an attack by the Wildebeest Society during the event known as &quot;Titans Hunt&quot;. He was later revealed to be alive in the fourth volume of &quot;Hawkman&quot; and went on to assist the Carter Hall Hawkman for some time. When Carter Hall seemingly perished, Charley Parker took on the mantle and became the fourth Hawkman, and revealed himself as the son of Carter Hall. In fact, he was the son of Fel Andar, and had been responsible for Carter&#x27;s troubles and his apparent demise. Carter Hall eventually defeated the Golden Eagle, their vendetta was later dropped, and Carter Hall reclaimed his mantle.

==Powers and abilities==
All incarnations of Hawkman used the fictional &quot;ninth metal&quot; or &quot;Nth metal&quot; to defy gravity and allow them to fly. The metal is in their costume&#x27;s belt, boots, and wings. Its abilities are controlled mentally. Their wings allow them to control their flight, though they can be &quot;flapped&quot; through use of shoulder motions. In most comic books, Hawkman is known to have slightly enhanced physical strength.

The Golden Age Hawkman was also granted the ability to breathe underwater by the sea god Poseidon. He also discovered a hidden kingdom of sentient birds led by the old One-Eye, who taught him their language and later sacrificed himself to save Hawkman&#x27;s life. Among the leading birds was a hawk named Big Red who became a companion and even helped the Golden Age Hawkman solve crimes.

The Silver Age Hawkman also had enhanced senses comparable to a hawk&#x27;s. He, and sometimes the Golden Age Hawkman as well, was also able to converse with birds, though not command them in the same way that Aquaman could command sea creatures. Hawkman also wore special contact lenses that allowed him to detect beams and radiation.

The Silver Age Hawkman also possessed a Thanagarian police space ship and a variety of science fictional weapons.

All versions of Hawkman prefer to use archaic weaponry—particularly maces, nets, spears, and shields—rather than modern or futuristic weapons. The current iteration prefers this in part because, having the memories of having lived through many past lives, he is more proficient in their use than with contemporary weapons. In Katar Hol&#x27;s case, it was too dangerous to use Thanagarian weaponry since there was too great a chance they could be lost or captured and then used or duplicated on Earth. There is, however, one significantly unique weapon Carter employs occasionally: the Claw of Horus. Constructed of Nth metal by Prince Khufu in ancient Egypt, it was delivered to the newly resurrected Carter Hall by the time-displaced Jay Garrick in &quot;JSA&quot; Book 3: &quot;The Return of Hawkman&quot;. Later, in &quot;Superman-Batman&quot; Book 1: &quot;Public Enemies&quot;, Hawkman used it to defeat Superman, using its Nth metal to channel the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field. As he explained to Superman, &quot;Essentially, I just hit you with the planet.&quot;

All versions of Hawkman have shown enhanced levels of strength. The Golden Age Hawkman was said to have the strength of 12 men but later that idea was dropped. Where as the Golden Age Hawkman&#x27;s strength appeared natural, it was later explained (with the 
Silver Age Hawkman) that the Nth metal enables its wielders to carry great weights. The recent incarnation has interpreted this as the Nth metal simply enhancing the strength of the user. Also, several JLA and JSA stories indicate that Thanagar has greater gravity than Earth, and that Thanagarians are naturally stronger than humans because they are adapted to it, similarly to how Atlanteans (e.g. Aquaman) are adapted to deep sea pressures.

It has also been explained in the &quot;JSA&quot; series that the Nth metal greatly aids in healing, closing wounds almost instantaneously. One example is in the &quot;JLA&quot; story &quot;Crisis of Conscience&quot;, in issues 115–118, when Carter&#x27;s arm is nearly severed during one part of the issue, but the wound has obviously closed and functionality returned by the end of the issue. The Atom has commented that Hawkman laughs at anything less than third-degree burns.

The Nth metal also regulates the body temperature of the wearer, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes. It also has the property of radiating heat, which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates.

==Other versions==
* During the chronal disruptions of &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, multiple versions of Hawkman (and Hawkgirl/Hawkwoman) from alternate timelines were appearing in and out of existence. It turns out the Hawks were one of many anomalies in the timestream resulting from the Crisis. Somehow the various versions were converged into the current reality&#x27;s Katar Hol.
* A Hawkman evolved from Robin in the &quot;Just Imagine...&quot; comic book. This version was a humanoid hawk, similar to Northwind.
* Hawkman&#x27;s Anti-matter Earth counterpart is Blood Eagle. He was killed by the Crime Syndicate. It is unclear whether he is a Thanagarian (like Katar Hol) or a human (like Carter Hall).

==Main enemies==
In the golden age of comics, Hawkman&#x27;s arch nemesis was Hath-Set. In the silver age, Hackman faced Hyathis, a plant elemental and ruler of Alstair who tried to conquer Thanagar and use the Hawkmen to invade Rann. Kanjar Ro was a former ruler of Dhor and Thanagarian official who sought power on Thanagar. Byth was a Thanagarian thief who gained shapeshifting abilities and became a villain on Earth. Matter Master, Mark Mandrill, created a wand that allowed him to reshape and transmute matter. Shadow Thief, Carl Sands, turned into a shadow-based villain after an alien gave him the ability to manipulate objects in shadow form. Ira Quimby was a crook who gained short bursts of superintelligence after exposure to Zeta Beam radiation. Shrike, Toron Tos, became a villain after a global crime spree involving Aztec artifacts. Lion-Mane, Ed Dawson, was transformed into a werelion after touching a mystical meteor. Copperhead, a Batman villain, joined forces with Shadow-Thief and Tigress to menace the Hawks. Golden Eagle, Charley Parker, was the son of Hawkman’s enemy and plotted to replace him. Fadeaway Man, Anton Lamont, used a magical cloak to teleport and commit crimes.
More recently, Hawkman faced Blackfire, Fel Andar, Tigress, White Dragon, and Headhunter.

==Awards==
The series and character have won several awards over the years, including:
* 1961 Alley Award for &quot;Best Adventure Hero/Heroine Not in Own Book&quot;
* 1962 Alley Award for &quot;Best Hero&quot;
* 1963 Alley Award for &quot;Cross-Over of DC Heroes&quot; (&quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; with the Flash)

==Reception==
Hawkman was ranked as the 118th-greatest comic book character of all time by &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine. IGN also ranked Hawkman as the 56th-greatest comic book hero of all time, stating that the best part of Hawkman is his incredibly short fuse. IGN also described him as a complete and total badass.

<text>A telecommunication circuit is a path in a telecommunications network used to transmit information. Circuits have evolved from generally being built on physical connections between individual hardware cables, as in an analog phone switch, to virtual circuits established over packet switching networks.

==Definitions==
A telecommunication circuit may be defined as follows:

* The complete path between two terminals over which one-way or two-way communications may be provided.
* An electronic path between two or more points, capable of providing a single or multiple communication channels.
* An electronic closed-loop path among two or more points used for signal transfer.

In operational terms, a telecommunication circuit may be capable of transmitting information in only one direction (&quot;simplex&quot; circuit), or it may be bi-directional (&quot;duplex&quot; circuit). Bi-directional circuits may support half-duplex operation, when only one end of the channel transmits at any one time, or they may support full-duplex operation where independent simultaneous transmission occurs in both directions.

==Applications==
Originally, telecommunication circuits transmitted analog signals. Radio stations used them as studio transmitter links (STLs) or as remote pickup unit (RPU) for sound reproduction, sometimes as a backup to other means. Later lines were digital, used in pair-gain applications, such as carrier systems, or in enterprise data networks.

A leased line, &quot;private circuit&quot;, or &quot;dedicated circuit&quot;, is a circuit that is dedicated to only one use and is typically not switched at a central office. The opposite is a switched circuit, which can be connected to different paths in a switching center or telephone exchange. Plain old telephone service (POTS) and ISDN telephone lines are switched circuits.

On certain packet switching telecommunication circuits, a virtual circuit may be created, while sharing the physical circuit.

<doc id="346009" wikidata="Q1271523" url="?curid=346009" title="Upper Senegal and Niger">
<text>Upper Senegal and Niger () was a colony in French West Africa, created on 21 October 1904 from colonial Senegambia and Niger by the decree &quot;For the Reorganisation of the general government of French West Africa&quot;.

At its creation, the &quot;Colony of Upper Senegal and Niger&quot; contained the old territories of Upper Senegal, the Middle Niger, and the military Niger territory. Its capital was Bamako.

==History==
From early on Upper Senegal and Niger was wracked by violence in the face of colonial reorganization and taxation. Most notable were the Kobkitanda rebellion, led by the blind cleric Alfa Saibou, and the Karma revolt (December 1905–March 1906) of Oumarou Karma. The latter engulfed much of the Niger valley and was suppressed by four French columns arriving from Dori, Gao, Tahoua, and Zinder.

A decree of 2 March 1907 added the &quot;cercles&quot; of Fada N&#x27;gourma and Say, which had been part of the colony of French Dahomey (present-day Benin). On 1 January 1912, the military territory of Niger was split off from Upper Senegal and Niger, and was erected into a colony in 1922.

Between November 1915 and February 1917, the Colony of Upper Senegal and Niger witnessed vastly popular, temporarily successful, and sustained armed opposition to the colonial government in its western Volta region, which is referred to as the Volta-Bani War. It challenged colonial government authority for more than a year in an area stretching from Koudougou (in present-day Burkina Faso) in the east, to the banks of the Bani River (present-day Mali) in the west. This was the most significant armed opposition to colonial authority organized anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa in the period preceding World War II.

===Division===
After World War I ended, the unsuspected success of this resistance movement caused the French authorities to issue the decree &quot;Concerning the Division of the Colony of Upper Senegal and Niger and the Creation of the Colony of Upper Volta&quot; of 1 March 1919, which divided the colony into two distinct units:
* French Upper Volta, formed from the &quot;cercles&quot; of Gaoua, Bobo-Dioulasso, Dédougou, Ouagadougou, Dori, Say, and Fada N&#x27;Gourma;
* the remaining territory – present-day Mali – was still called &quot;Upper Senegal and Niger&quot; until it was renamed &quot;French Sudan&quot; on 1 January 1921, implementing the decree of 4 December 1920, &quot;For the Denomination of the Colonies and Territories Composing the General Government of French West Africa.&quot;

===Stamps===
The colony of Upper Senegal and Niger is perhaps remembered most often by philatelists since it issued a number of postage stamps during its existence.

<doc id="346011" wikidata="Q2062178" url="?curid=346011" title="Kegworth air disaster">
<text>The Kegworth air disaster occurred when British Midland Airways Flight 092, a Boeing 737-400, crashed onto the motorway embankment between the M1 motorway and A453 road near Kegworth, Leicestershire, England, while attempting to make an emergency landing at East Midlands Airport on 8 January 1989.

The aircraft was on a scheduled flight from London Heathrow Airport to Belfast International Airport. When a fan blade broke in the left engine, smoke was drawn into the cabin through the air conditioning system. The pilots believed this indicated a fault in the right engine, since earlier models of the 737 ventilated the cabin from the right, and they were unaware that the 737-400 used a different system. The pilots retarded the right thrust lever and the symptoms of smoke and vibration cleared, leading them to believe the problem had been identified, and then the right engine was shut down. 

On the final stage of the approach, thrust was increased on the left engine. The tip of the fan blade that had lodged in the cowling from the earlier event became dislodged and was drawn into the core of the engine, damaging it and causing a fire. 

The fan blade had initially suffered a fracture caused by aerodynamic flutter. Those responsible for the pre-certification test programme and the issue of a Certificate of Airworthiness &#x27;acted contrary&#x27; to the wealth of literature that was available on this subject. This knowledge made clear that static ground testing to discover the presence of flutter was unreliable and the fan blade had to be subjected to the full flight envelope to be certain of the test results. 

The accident was the first hull loss of a Boeing 737 Classic aircraft, and the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 737 Classic aircraft. Of the 126 people aboard, 47 died and 74 sustained serious injuries.

==Aircraft involved and crew==
===Aircraft===
The aircraft was a British Midland-operated Boeing 737-4Y0, registration on a scheduled flight from London Heathrow Airport to Belfast International Airport, Northern Ireland, having already flown from Heathrow to Belfast and back that day. The 737-400 was the newest design from Boeing, with the first unit entering service less than four months earlier, in September 1988. G-OBME had accumulated 521 airframe hours. The aircraft was powered by two CFM International CFM56 turbofan engines.

===Cockpit crew===
The flight was crewed by 43-year-old Captain Kevin Hunt and 39-year-old First Officer David McClelland. Hunt had been with British Midland since 1966 and had about 13,200 hours of flying experience. First Officer McClelland joined the airline in 1988 and had about 3,300 total flight hours. Between them, the pilots had close to 1,000 hours in the Boeing 737 cockpit (Hunt had 763 hours, and McClelland had 192 hours), but only 76 of these had been in Boeing 737-400 series aircraft (Hunt 23 hours and McClelland 53 hours).

==Accident==

After taking off from Heathrow at 19:52, Flight BD 092 was climbing through to reach its cruising altitude of when a blade detached from the fan of the port (left) engine. The pilots did not know the source of the problem, but heard a pounding noise, accompanied by severe vibrations. Smoke poured into the cabin through the ventilation system, and passengers became aware of the smell of burning. Several passengers sitting near the rear of the plane noticed smoke and sparks coming from the left engine. The flight was diverted to nearby East Midlands Airport at the suggestion of British Midland Airways Operations.

After the initial blade fracture, Captain Kevin Hunt, the non-handling pilot, took control without first advising McClelland, and disengaged the plane&#x27;s autopilot. Hunt then asked First Officer David McClelland which engine was malfunctioning, McClelland replied: &quot;It&#x27;s the le... It&#x27;s the right one&quot;. In previous versions of the 737, the right (number 2) engine supplied air to the flight deck. The pilots had been used to the older version of the aircraft and did not realise that this aircraft was different. The captain later claimed that his perception of smoke as coming forward from the passenger cabin led them to assume the fault was in the right engine. The pilots throttled back the working right engine instead of the malfunctioning left engine. They had no way of visually checking the engines from the cockpit, and the cabin crew – who did not hear the captain refer to the right hand engine in his cabin address – did not inform them that smoke and flames had been seen from the left engine.

When the pilots retarded the right engine, they could no longer smell the smoke or feel the vibration, which led them to believe that they had correctly dealt with the problem. As it turned out, this was due to a combination of the Power Management Control unit and autothrottle which was disengaged prior to shutting down the right engine, the fuel flow to both engines was reduced, and the excess fuel, which had been igniting in the left engine exhaust, disappeared; therefore, the ongoing damage was reduced, the smell of smoke ceased, and the vibration reduced, although it would still have been visible on cockpit instruments which were &quot;at best unclear and at worst misleading&quot; according to Dr Roger Green from the RAF Institute of Air Medicine.
During the final approach to the East Midlands Airport, the pilots selected increased thrust from the operating, damaged engine. This led to an engine fire, caused by the tip of the fan blade dislodging from the cowling, going into the core of the engine and causing it to cease operating entirely. The ground proximity warning system activated, sounding several &quot;glideslope&quot; warnings. The pilots attempted to restart the right engine by windmilling, but the aircraft was by now only 900 feet above the ground and flying too slowly for a restart. At 20:24:33, Captain Hunt broadcast to the passengers via the aircraft&#x27;s public-address system: &quot;Prepare for crash landing&quot;, instructing passengers to take the brace position. The stick shaker then activated. Just before crossing the M1 motorway at 20:24:43, the tail and main landing gear struck the ground at a speed of and the aircraft bounced back into the air and over the motorway, knocking down trees and a lamp post before crashing on the far embankment around short of the active runway&#x27;s paved surface and about from its threshold. The aircraft broke into three sections. This was adjacent to the motorway, but no vehicles were travelling on that part of the M1 at the moment of the crash.

==Casualties==
Of the 118 passengers on board, 39 were killed outright in the crash and eight died later of their injuries, giving a total of 47 fatalities. All eight crew members survived the accident. Of the 79 survivors, 74 suffered serious injuries and five suffered minor injuries. In addition, five firefighters also suffered minor injuries during the rescue operation. No-one on the motorway was injured, and all vehicles in the vicinity of the disaster were undamaged. The first person to arrive at the scene and render aid was a motorist, Graham Pearson. A former Royal Marine, he helped passengers for over three hours, and subsequently received damages for post-traumatic stress disorder. Aid was also given by a troop of eight SAS soldiers, four of whom were regimentally qualified paramedics. Their truck had been on the motorway when the crash occurred.

==Causes==

The investigation established that the wiring associated with the fire warning lights was properly connected. Initially there was a concern that the sensors in the engines and the warning lights on the flight deck may have been cross-wired.

===Shutting down of wrong engine===
Captain Hunt believed the right engine was malfunctioning due to the smell of smoke in the cabin because in previous Boeing 737 variants, bleed air for cabin air conditioning was taken from the right engine. Starting with the Boeing 737-400 variant, Boeing had redesigned the system to use bleed air from both engines. Several cabin staff and passengers noticed that the left engine had a stream of unburnt fuel igniting in the jet exhaust, but this information was not passed to the pilots because cabin staff assumed they were aware that the left engine was malfunctioning.

The smell of smoke disappeared when the autothrottle was disengaged and the right engine shut down due to reduction of fuel to the damaged left engine as it reverted to manual throttle. In the event of a malfunction, pilots were trained to check all meters and review all decisions, and Captain Hunt proceeded to do so. Whilst he was conducting the review, however, he was interrupted by a transmission from East Midlands Airport informing him he could descend further to in preparation for the diverted landing. He did not resume the review after the transmission ended, and instead commenced descent.

The dials on the two vibration gauges (one for each engine) were smaller than on the previous versions of the 737 in which the pilots had the majority of their experience and the LED needle went around the outside of the dial as opposed to the inside. The pilots had received no simulator training on the new model, as no simulator for the 737-400 existed in the UK at that time. At the time, vibration indicators were known for being unreliable (and normally ignored by pilots), but unknown to the pilots, this was one of the first aircraft to have a very accurate vibration readout, although it was still permitted to fly with one gauge unserviceable under Boeing&#x27;s Minimum Equipment List.

===Engine malfunction===
Analysis of the engine from the crash determined that the fan blades (LP stage 1 compressor) of the uprated CFM International CFM56 engine used on the 737-400 were subject to abnormal amounts of vibration when operating at high power settings above . As it was an upgrade to an existing engine, in-flight testing was not mandatory, and the engine had only been tested in the laboratory. Upon this discovery, the remaining 99 Boeing 737-400s then in service were grounded and the engines modified. Following the crash, testing all newly designed and significantly redesigned turbofan engines under representative flight conditions is now mandatory.

This unnoticed vibration created excessive metal fatigue in the fan blades, and on G-OBME this caused one of the fan blades to break off. This damaged the engine terminally and also upset its delicate balance, causing a reduction in power and an increase in vibration. The autothrottle attempted to compensate for this by increasing the fuel flow to the engine. The damaged engine was unable to burn all the additional fuel, with much of it igniting in the exhaust flow, creating a large trail of flame behind the engine.

==Aftermath==

The official report into the disaster made 31 safety recommendations. Evaluation of the injuries sustained led to considerable improvements in aircraft safety and emergency instructions for passengers. These were derived from a research programme funded by the CAA and carried out by teams from the University of Nottingham and Hawtal Whiting Structures (an engineering consultancy company). The study between medical staff and engineers used analytical &quot;occupant kinematics&quot; techniques to assess the effectiveness of the brace position. A new notice to operators revising the brace position was issued in October 1993.

The research into this accident led to the formation on 21 November 2016 of the International Board for Research into Aircraft Crash Events, which is a joint co-operation between experts in the field for the purpose of producing an internationally agreed-upon, evidence-based set of impact bracing positions for passengers and (eventually) cabin crew members in a variety of seating configurations. These will be submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organization through its Cabin Safety Group. 

A memorial was built in the village cemetery in nearby Kegworth to &quot;those who died, those who were injured and those who took part in the rescue operation&quot;, together with a garden made using soil from the crash site.

Captain Hunt and First Officer McClelland, both seriously injured in the crash, were dismissed following the criticisms of their actions in the Air Accidents Investigation Branch report. Hunt suffered injuries to his spine and legs in the crash. In April 1991, he told a BBC documentary, &quot;We were the easy option – the cheap option if you wish. We made a mistake – we both made mistakes – but the question we would like answered is why we made those mistakes.&quot; British Midland later paid McClelland an out-of-court settlement for unfair dismissal.

Alan Webb, the chief fire officer at East Midlands Airport, was made an MBE in the 1990 New Year Honours list for the co-ordination of his team in the rescue efforts that followed the crash. Graham Pearson, a passing motorist who assisted Kegworth survivors at the crash site for three hours, sued the airline for post-traumatic stress disorder and was awarded £57,000 in damages in 1998 ().

==Media==
The crash was featured in a 1991 documentary, an episode of the series &quot;Taking Liberties&quot; named &quot;Fatal Error&quot;. ITV aired a documentary in 1999 of the Kegworth crash. Flight 092 was also featured in an episode of &quot;Seconds From Disaster&quot; called &quot;Motorway Plane Crash&quot;.

It was also featured in the 2011 Discovery Channel documentary &quot;Aircrash Confidential&quot;.

In 2015, the incident was featured in the episode &quot;Choosing Sides&quot; or &quot;M1 Plane Crash&quot; of the documentary television series &quot;Mayday&quot;, or &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot;, as it is known in the UK.

In 2024, the incident was also featured on the &quot;M1 Plane Crash&quot; episode of &quot;Terror at 30,000 Feet&quot; on Channel 5.

<text>The Maghreb (; ), also known as the Arab Maghreb () and Northwest Africa, is the western part of the Arab world. The region comprises western and central North Africa, including Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. The Maghreb also includes the disputed territory of Western Sahara. As of 2018, the region had a population of over 100 million people.

The Maghreb is usually defined as encompassing much of the northern part of Africa, including a large portion of the Sahara Desert, but excluding Egypt and the Sudan, which are considered to be located in the Mashriq — the eastern part of the Arab world. The traditional definition of the Maghreb — which restricted its scope to the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plains of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya — was expanded in modern times to include Mauritania and the disputed territory of Western Sahara. During the era of al-Andalus on the Iberian Peninsula (711–1492), the Maghreb&#x27;s inhabitants — the Muslim Maghrebis — were known by Europeans as the &quot;Moors&quot;. The Greeks referred to the region as the &quot;Land of the Atlas&quot;, referring to its Atlas Mountains.

Before the establishment of modern nation states in the region during the 20th century, the &quot;Maghreb&quot; most commonly referred to a smaller area, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlas Mountains in the south. It often also included the territory of eastern Libya, but not modern Mauritania. As recently as the late 19th century, the term &quot;Maghreb&quot; was used to refer to the western Mediterranean region of coastal North Africa in general, and to Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia in particular.

The region comprising the Maghreb was somewhat unified as an independent political entity under the kingdom of Numidia. This period was followed by one of the Roman Empire&#x27;s rule or influence. The Germanic Vandals invaded after that, followed by the equally brief re-establishment of a weak Roman rule by the Byzantine Empire. The Islamic caliphates came to power under the Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid Caliphate and the Fatimid Caliphate. The most enduring rule was that of the local Arab empires of the Aghlabids, Idrisids, Salihids, Sulaymanids, Umayyads of Cordoba, Hammudids, Nasrids, Saadians, Alawites and the Sennusids, as well as the Berber empires of the Ifranids, Almoravids, Almohads, Hammadids, Zirids, Marinids, Zayyanids, Hafsids and Wattasids, extending from the 8th to 13th centuries. The Ottoman Empire also controlled parts of the region for a period.

Centuries of Arab migration to the Maghreb since the 7th century shifted the demographic scope of the Maghreb in favor of the Arabs. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the region was ruled by European powers: France (Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and most of Morocco), Spain (northern Morocco and Western Sahara), and Italy (Libya). Italy was expelled from North Africa by the Allies in World War II. Decolonization of the region continued in the decades thereafter, with violent conflicts such as the Rif War, Algerian War, the Ifni War and the Western Sahara War.

Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia established the Arab Maghreb Union in 1989 to promote cooperation and economic integration in a common market. The union implicitly included Western Sahara under Morocco&#x27;s membership. However, this progress was short-lived, and the union is now largely dormant. Tensions between Algeria and Morocco over Western Sahara re-emerged, reinforced by the unresolved border dispute between the two countries. These two conflicts have hindered progress on the union&#x27;s joint goals.

==Terminology==
The toponym &quot;maghrib&quot; () is an Arabic term that the first Muslim Arab settlers gave to the recently conquered area situated west of the Umayyad capital of Damascus in the 7th century AD. The term was used to refer to the region extending from Alexandria in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west. Etymologically, it means both &quot;the western place/land&quot; and &quot;the place where the sun sets&quot;, in contrast to the Mashriq, the Fertile Crescent and eastern part of the Arab world. In &quot;Aḥsan al-Taqāsīm fī Ma&#x27;rifat al-Aqālīm&quot; (c. 985 AD), medieval Arab geographer Al-Maqdisi used the term &quot;Arab regions&quot; () to refer to the lands of Arabia, Iraq, Upper Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Maghreb. This constituted the earliest documented differentiation between the terms Maghreb and Gharb (Muslim lands west of the Abbasid capital, Baghdad). The former referred to the present-day Maghreb whereas the latter incorporated the Levant and Egypt in addition to the Maghreb.

Medieval Muslim historians and geographers divided the Maghreb region into three areas: &quot;al-Maghrib al-Adna&quot; (the near Maghrib; also known as Ifriqiya), which included the lands extending from Alexandria to Tarabulus (modern-day Tripoli) in the west; &quot;al-Maghrib al-Awsat&quot; (the middle Maghrib), which extended from Tripoli to Bijaya (Béjaïa); and &quot;al-Maghrib al-Aqsa&quot; (the far Maghrib), which extended from Tahart (Tiaret) to the Atlantic Ocean. Historians and geographers disagreed, however, over the definition of the eastern boundary. Some authors place it at the sea of Kulzum (the Red Sea) and thus include Egypt and Barqa (Cyrenaica) in the Maghreb. Ibn Khaldun does not accept this definition because, he says, the inhabitants of the Maghreb do not consider Egypt and Barqa as forming part of Maghrib. The latter commences only at the province of Tripoli and includes the districts of which the country of the Berbers was composed in former times. Later Maghribi writers repeated the definition of Ibn Khaldun, with a few variations in details.

The term Maghrib is used in opposition to Mashriq in a sense near to that which it had in medieval times, but it also denotes simply Morocco when the full &quot;al-Maghrib al-Aqsa&quot; is abbreviated. Certain politicians seek a political union of the North African countries, which they call &quot;al-Maghrib al-Kabir&quot; (the grand Maghrib) or &quot;al-Maghrib al-Arabi&quot; (the Arab Maghrib).

==History==

===Prehistory===
Some 9,000 years ago, Earth&#x27;s tilt was 24.14 degrees, as compared with the current 23.45 degrees. Around 3,500 BC, these changes in the tilt of the Earth&#x27;s orbit appear to have caused a rapid desertification of the Sahara region forming a natural barrier that severely limited contact between the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa. The Berber people have inhabited western North Africa since at least 10,000 BC.

===Antiquity===

Partially isolated from the rest of the continent by the Atlas Mountains (stretching from present-day Morocco to present-day Tunisia) and by the Sahara desert, inhabitants of the northern parts of the Maghreb have long had commercial and cultural ties across the Mediterranean Sea to the inhabitants of the regions of Southern Europe and Western Asia. These trade relations date back at least to the Phoenicians in the 1st millennium BC. (According to tradition, the Phoenicians founded their colony of Carthage (in present-day Tunisia) ).

Phoenicians and Carthaginians arrived for trade. The main Berber and Phoenician settlements centered in the Gulf of Tunis (Carthage, Utica, Tunisia) along the North African littoral, between the Pillars of Hercules and the Libyan coast east of ancient Cyrenaica. They dominated the trade and intercourse of the Western Mediterranean for centuries. Rome&#x27;s defeat of Carthage in the Punic Wars (264 to 146 BC) enabled Rome to establish the Province of Africa (146 BC) and to control many of these ports. Rome eventually took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains. Rome was greatly helped by the defection of Massinissa (later King of Numidia, ) and of Carthage&#x27;s eastern Numidian Massylii client-allies. Some of the most mountainous regions, such as the Moroccan Rif, remained outside Roman control. Furthermore, during the rule of the Romans, Byzantines, Vandals and Carthaginians the Kabyle people were the only or one of the few in North Africa who remained independent. The Kabyle people were incredibly resistible so much so that even during the Arab conquest of North Africa they still had control and possession over their mountains.

The pressure put on the Western Roman Empire by the Barbarian invasions (notably by the Vandals and Visigoths in Iberia) in the 5th century AD reduced Roman control and led to the establishment of the Vandal Kingdom of North Africa in 430 A.D., with its capital at Carthage. A century later, the Byzantine emperor Justinian I sent (533) a force under General Belisarius that succeeded in destroying the Vandal Kingdom in 534. Byzantine rule lasted for 150 years. The Berbers contested the extent of Byzantine control.

After the advent of Islam in Mediterranean Africa in the period from 639 to 700 AD, Arabs took control of the entire Maghreb region.

===Middle Ages===

The Arabs reached the Maghreb in early Umayyad times in the 7th century, and from then the Arab migration to the Maghreb began. Islamic Berber kingdoms such as the Almohads expansion and the spread of Islam contributed to the development of trans-Saharan trade. In addition, several Arab dynasties formed in the Maghreb region, such as the Idrisids, Aghlabids, Sulaymanids and more. While restricted due to the cost and dangers, the trade was highly profitable. Commodities traded included such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and slaves. Various Islamic variations, such as the Ibadis and the Shia, were adopted by some Berbers, often leading to scorning of Caliphal control in favour of their own interpretation of Islam.

The invasion of the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arabs in the 11th century played a major role in spreading Bedouin Arabic to rural areas such as the countryside and steppes, and as far as the southern areas near the Sahara. It also heavily transformed the culture in the Maghreb into Arab culture, and spread Bedouin nomadism in areas where agriculture was previously dominant. These Bedouin tribes accelerated and deepened the Arabization process, since the Berber population was gradually assimilated by the newcomers and had to share with them pastures and seasonal migration paths. By around the 15th century, the region of modern-day Tunisia had already been almost completely Arabized. As Arab nomads spread, the territories of the local Berber tribes were moved and shrank. The Zenata were pushed to the west and the Kabyles were pushed to the north. The Berbers took refuge in the mountains whereas the plains were Arabized. These Arabs had been set upon the Berbers by the Fatimids in punishment for their Zirid former Berber clients who defected and abandoned Shiism in the 11th century. Throughout this period, the Maghreb most often was divided into three states, roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and Tunisia. The Maghreb region was occasionally briefly unified, as under the Almohad Caliphate, Fatimids and briefly under the Zirids. The Hammadids also managed to conquer land in all countries in the Maghreb region.

===Early modern history===

===Modern history===


After the 19th century, areas of the Maghreb were colonized by France, Spain, and later Italy.

Today, more than two and a half million Maghrebi immigrants live in France, many from Algeria and Morocco. In addition, as of 1999 there were 3 million French of Maghrebi origin (defined as having at least one grandparent from Algeria, Morocco, or Tunisia). A 2003 estimate suggests six million French residents were ethnic Maghrebi.

==Population==


===Ethnic groups===
The Maghreb is primarily inhabited by peoples of Arab and Berber ancestral origin. Arabs inhabit Algeria (70% to 80%), Libya (97%), Morocco (67%), and Tunisia (98%). Berbers inhabit Algeria (20%), Libya (10%), Morocco (35%), and Tunisia (1%). Ethnic French, Spanish, West African, and Sephardic Jewish populations also inhabit the region. Centuries of Arabization and Arab migration to the Maghreb since the 7th century shifted the demographic scope of the Maghreb in favor of the Arabs.

Various other influences are also prominent throughout the Maghreb. In northern coastal towns, in particular, several waves of European immigrants influenced the population in the Medieval era. Most notable were the moriscos and muladies, that is, the indigenous Spaniards (Moors) who were forcibly converted to Catholicism and later expelled, together with ethnic Arab and Berber Muslims, during the Spanish Catholic Reconquista. Other European contributions included French, Italian, and English crews and passengers taken captive by corsairs. In some cases, they were returned to families after being ransomed; in others, they were used as slaves or assimilated and adopted into tribes.

Historically, the Maghreb was home to significant historic Jewish communities called &quot;Maghrebim&quot;, who predated the 7th-century introduction and conversion of the region to Islam. The earliest recorded Jewish settlement in the region dates back to the third century BCE under Ptolemaic rule in what is now Libya, although Jewish presence may have begun even earlier. Jewish communities continued to develop throughout the Roman period in present-day Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, with evidence of their existence during the early centuries CE. During the early Muslim era, Jews flourished in major urban centers such as Kairouan, Fez, and Tunis, despite facing intermittent persecution, notably under the Almohads. The influx of Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal, fleeing pogroms, forced conversions and expulsions in the 14th to 16th centuries, further augmented the Jewish presence in North Africa.

Another significant group is Turks, who migrated with the expansion of the Ottoman Empire.

Africans from south of the Sahara joined the population mix during centuries of trans-Saharan trade. Traders and slaves went to the Maghreb from the Sahel region. On the Saharan southern edge of the Maghreb are small communities of black populations, sometimes called Haratine.

In Algeria especially, a large European minority, known as the &quot;&quot;pied noirs&quot;&quot;, immigrated to the region, settling under French colonial rule in the late 19th century. As of the last census in French-ruled Algeria, taken on 1 June 1960, there were 1,050,000 non-Muslim civilians (mostly Catholic, but including 130,000 Algerian Jews) in Algeria, 10 per cent of the population. They established farms and businesses. The overwhelming majority of these, however, left Algeria during and following the war for independence.

In comparison to the population of France, the Maghrebi population was one-eighth of France&#x27;s population in 1800, one-quarter in 1900, and equal in 2000. The Maghreb is home to 1% of the global population as of 2010.

===Genetics===
The Y-chromosome genetic structure of the Maghreb population seems to be modulated chiefly by geography. The Y-DNA Haplogroups E1b1b and J make up the vast majority of the genetic markers of the populations of the Maghreb. Haplogroup E1b1b is the most frequent among Maghrebi groups, especially the downstream lineage of E1b1b1b1a, which is typical of the indigenous Berbers of North-West Africa. Haplogroup J1 is the second most frequent among Maghrebi groups and is more indicative of Middle East origins, and has its highest distribution among populations in Arabia and the Levant. Due to the distribution of E-M81(E1b1b1b1a), which has reached its highest documented levels in the world at 95–100% in some populations of the Maghreb, it has often been termed the &quot;Berber marker&quot; in the scientific literature. The second most common marker, Haplogroup J, especially J1, which is typically Middle Eastern and originates in the Arabian peninsula, can reach frequencies of up to 35% in the region. Its highest density is found in the Arabian Peninsula. Haplogroup R1, a Eurasian marker, has also been observed in the Maghreb, though with lower frequency. The Y-DNA haplogroups shown above are observed in both Arabic speakers and Berber-speakers.

====Haplogroup E====
Haplogroup E is thought to have emerged in prehistoric North Africa or East Africa, and would have later dispersed into West Asia. The major subclades of haplogroup E found amongst Berbers belong to E-Z827, which is believed to have emerged in North Africa. Common subclades include E1b1b1a, E1b1b1b and E1b1b1*. E1b1b1b is distributed along a west-to-east cline with frequencies that can reach as high as 100 percent in Northwest Africa. E1b1b1a has been observed at low to moderate frequencies among Berber populations with significantly higher frequencies observed in Northeast Africa relative to Northwest Africa. Loosdrecht et al. 2018 demonstrated that E1b1b is most likely indigenous to North Africa and migrated from North Africa to the Near East during the Paleolithic.

====Haplogroup J1====
Haplogroup J-M267 is another very common haplogroup in the Maghreb, being the second most-frequent haplogroup in the Maghreb. It originated in the Middle East, and its highest frequency of 30%–62.5% has been observed in Muslim Arab populations in the Middle East. A study found out that the majority of J1 (Eu10) chromosomes in the Maghreb are due to the recent gene flow caused by the Arab migrations to the Maghreb in the first millennium CE. The J-M267 chromosome pool in the Maghreb is derived not only from early Neolithic dispersions but to a much greater extent from recent expansions of Arab tribes from the Arabian Peninsula, during which both southern Qahtanite and northern Adnanite Arabs added to the heterogenous Maghrebi ethnic melting pot. A study from 2017 suggested that these Arab migrations were a demographic process that heavily implied gene flow and remodeled the genetic structure of the Maghreb, rather than a mere cultural replacement as claimed by older studies.

Recent genome-wide analysis of North Africans found substantial shared ancestry with the Middle East, and to a lesser extent sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. The recent gene flow caused by the Arab migrations to the Maghreb increased genetic similarities between Maghrebis and Middle Easterners. Haplogroup J1-M267 accounts for around 30% of Maghrebis and has spread from the Arabian Peninsula, second after E1b1b1b which accounts for 45% of Maghrebis. A study from 2021 has shown that the highest frequency of the Middle Eastern component ever observed in North Africa so far was observed in the Arabs of Wesletia in Tunisia, who had a Middle Eastern component frequency of 71.8%. According to a study from 2004, Haplogroup J1 had a frequency of 35% in Algerians and 34.2% in Tunisians.

====Table====
The Maghreb Y chromosome pool (including both Arab and Berber populations) may be summarized for most of the populations as follows, where only two haplogroups E1b1b and J comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes:

==Religion==
The original religions of the peoples of the Maghreb seem to have been based in and related to fertility cults of a strong matriarchal pantheon. This theory is based on the social and linguistic structures of the Amazigh cultures that antedated all Egyptian and eastern Asian, northern Mediterranean, and European influences.

Historic records of religion in the Maghreb region show its gradual inclusion in the Classical World, with coastal colonies established first by Phoenicians, some Greeks, and later extensive conquest and colonization by the Romans. By the 2nd century of the common era, the area had become a center of Phoenician-speaking Christianity. Its bishops spoke and wrote in Punic, and Emperor Septimius Severus was noted by his local accent. Roman settlers and Romanized populations converted to Christianity. Carthage subsequently exercised informal primacy as an archdiocese, being the most important center of Christianity in the whole of Roman Africa, corresponding to most of today&#x27;s Mediterranean coast and inland of Northern Africa. The region produced figures such as Christian church writer Tertullian (c. 155 – c. 202); and Christian martyrs or leading figures such as Perpetua, and Felicity (martyrs, c. 200 CE); St. Cyprian of Carthage (+ 258); St. Monica; her son the philosopher St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo I (+ 430) (1); and St. Julia of Carthage (5th century). Donatist Christianity mainly spread among the indigenous Berber population, and from the late fifth and early sixth century, the region included several Christian Berber kingdoms.

===Islam===
Islam arrived in 647 and challenged the domination of Christianity. The first permanent foothold of Islam was the founding in 667 of the city of Kairouan, in present-day Tunisia. Carthage fell to Muslims in 698 and the remainder of the region fell by 709. Islamization proceeded slowly.

From the end of the 7th century, over a period of more than 400 years, the region&#x27;s peoples converted to Islam. Many left during this time for Italy, although surviving letters showed correspondence from regional Christians to Rome up until the 12th century. Christianity was still a living faith. Although there were numerous conversions after the conquest, Muslims did not become a majority until some time late in the 9th century. During the 10th century, Islam became by far the dominant religion in the region. Christian bishoprics and dioceses continued to be active and continued their relations with the Christian Church of Rome. As late as the reign of Pope Benedict VII (974–983), a new Archbishop of Carthage was consecrated. From the 10th century, Christianity declined in the region. By the end of the 11th century, only two bishops were left in Carthage and Hippo Regius. Pope Gregory VII (1073–85) consecrated a new bishop for Hippo. Christianity seems to have suffered several shocks that led to its demise. First, many upper-class, urban-dwelling, Latin-speaking Christians left for Europe after the Muslim conquest. The second major influence was the large-scale conversions to Islam from the end of the 9th century. Many Christians of a much reduced community departed in the mid-11th century, and remnants were evacuated in the 12th by the Norman rulers of Sicily. The Latin-African language lingered a while longer.

There was a small but thriving Jewish community, as well as a small Christian community. Most Muslims follow the Sunni Maliki school. Small Ibadi communities remain in some areas. A strong tradition of venerating marabouts and saints&#x27; tombs is found throughout regions inhabited by Berbers. This practice was also common among the Jews of the region. Any map of the region demonstrates the tradition by the proliferation of &quot;Sidi&quot;s, showing places named after the marabouts. This tradition has declined through the 20th century. A network of &quot;zaouias&quot; traditionally helped teach basic literacy and knowledge of Islam in rural regions.

===Christianity===

Communities of Christians, mostly Catholics and Protestant, persist in Algeria (100,000–380,000), Mauritania (10,000), Morocco (~380,000), Libya (170,000), and Tunisia (100,750). Most of the Roman Catholics in Greater Maghreb are of French, Spanish, and Italian descent, with ancestors who immigrated during the colonial era. Some are foreign missionaries or immigrant workers. There are also Christian communities of Berber or Arab descent in Greater Maghreb, made up of persons who converted mostly during the modern era, or under and after French colonialism.

Prior to independence, Algeria was home to 1.4 million &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; (ethnic French who were mostly Catholic), and Morocco was home to half a million Europeans, Tunisia was home to 255,000 Europeans, and Libya was home to 145,000 Europeans. In religion, most of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; in Maghreb are Catholic. Due to the exodus of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; in the 1960s, more North African Christians of Berber or Arab descent now live in France than in Greater Maghreb. Prior to independence, the European Catholic settlers had historic legacy and powerful presence in Maghreb countries.

Recently, the Protestant community of Berber or Arab descent has grown significantly as additional individuals convert to Christianity, especially to Evangelicalism. This has occurred in Algeria, especially in the Kabylie, Morocco, and in Tunisia. The Catholic population in Libya is estimated to number 100,000, The Catholics are the largest Christian denomination, followed by 60,000 Copts and a small number of Anglicans.

A 2015 study estimates 380,000 Muslims converted to Christianity in Algeria. The number of Moroccans who converted to Christianity (most of them secret worshipers) are estimated between 40,000-150,000. The International Religious Freedom Report for 2007 estimates thousands of Tunisian Muslims have converted to Christianity. A 2015 study estimate some 1,500 believers in Christ from a Muslim background living in Libya.

In 2019, the proportion of Melillans that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 65.0%, the Roman Catholic churches in Melilla belong to the Diocese of Málaga. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion in Ceuta, in 2019, the proportion of Ceutans that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 60.0%. The Roman Catholic churches in Ceuta belong to the Diocese of Cádiz y Ceuta.

===Jewish presence===
The earliest documented Jewish presence in the Maghreb dates to the third century BCE, with Jews being settled in eastern Libya by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt. During the Roman Empire, Jewish communities expanded across the Maghreb, with archaeological evidence, including synagogues and inscriptions, indicating their presence in what are now Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco from the early centuries CE. Under early Muslim rule, Jews flourished in major urban centers such as Kairouan, Fez, and Tunis, with the Jewish community in Kairouan particularly noted for its significant intellectual and cultural contributions. However, Jews also encountered periods of persecution, particularly under the Almohad Caliphate (12th–13th centuries), which imposed severe restrictions on non-Muslims. In the 14th to 16th centuries, the Maghreb experienced an influx of Jews fleeing from Spain and Portugal due to growing persecution and the Spanish Inquisition. Following the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492 and the forced mass conversions in Portugal in 1497, many Sephardic Jews settled in North Africa, establishing new communities and integrating with the existing Jewish populations.

In the 10th century, as the social and political environment in Baghdad became increasingly hostile to Jews, some Jewish traders emigrated to the Maghreb, especially Kairouan, Tunisia. Over the following two or three centuries, such Jewish traders became known as the Maghribi, a distinctive social group who traveled throughout the Mediterranean world. They passed this identification on from father to son. Their tight-knit pan-Maghreb community had the ability to use social sanctions as a credible alternative to legal recourse, which was weak at the time anyway. This unique institutional alternative permitted the Maghribis to very successfully participate in the Mediterranean trade. This facilitated contacts between the Maghrebi and European Jewish communities, particularly in trade in the pre-colonial period. The most important points of contact were Livorno in Italy with its harbour frequented by Tunisian merchants and Marseille in France with its counterpart, the harbour for Algeria and Morocco. The Maghreb region produced spices and leather, from shoes to handbags. As many of the Maghrebi Jews were craftsmen and merchants, they had contact with their European customers. Today, among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in Morocco with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia with about 1,000.

==Geography==

===Ecoregions===
The Maghreb is divided into a Mediterranean climate region in the north, and the arid Sahara in the south. The Maghreb&#x27;s variations in elevation, rainfall, temperature, and soils give rise to distinct communities of plants and animals. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) identifies several distinct ecoregions in the Maghreb.

====Mediterranean Maghreb====
The portions of the Maghreb between the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, along with coastal Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in Libya, are home to Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub. These ecoregions share many species of plants and animals with other portions of Mediterranean Basin. The southern extent of the Mediterranean Maghreb corresponds with the isohyet, or the southern range of the European Olive &quot;(Olea europea)&quot; and Esparto Grass &quot;(Stipa tenacissima)&quot;.
* Mediterranean acacia-argania dry woodlands and succulent thickets (Morocco, Canary Islands (Spain), Western Sahara)
* Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia)
* Mediterranean woodlands and forests (Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia)
* Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Spain)
* Mediterranean High Atlas juniper steppe (Morocco)

====Saharan Maghreb====
The Sahara extends across northern Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. Its central part is hyper-arid and supports little plant or animal life, but the northern portion of the desert receives occasional winter rains, while the strip along the Atlantic coast receives moisture from marine fog, which nourishes a greater variety of plants and animals. The northern edge of the Sahara corresponds to the 100 mm isohyet, which is also the northern range of the date palm &quot;(Phoenix dactylifera)&quot;.
* North Saharan steppe and woodlands: This ecoregion lies along the northern edge of the Sahara, next to the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of the Mediterranean Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the Mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south. It covers 1,675,300 square km (646,800 square miles) in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, and Western Sahara.
* Atlantic coastal desert: The Atlantic coastal desert occupies a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast, where fog generated offshore by the cool Canary Current provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of lichens, succulents, and shrubs. It covers in Western Sahara and Mauritania.
* Sahara desert: This ecoregion covers the hyper-arid central portion of the Sahara where rainfall is minimal and sporadic. Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes &quot;(erg)&quot;, stone plateaus &quot;(hamada)&quot;, gravel plains &quot;(reg)&quot;, dry valleys &quot;(wadi)&quot;, and salt flats. It covers 4,639,900 square km (1,791,500 square miles) of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan.
* Saharan halophytics: Seasonally flooded saline depressions in the Maghreb are home to halophytic, or salt-adapted, plant communities. The Saharan halophytics cover 54,000 square km (20,800 square miles), including Tunisian salt lakes of central Tunisia, Chott Melghir in Algeria, and other areas of Egypt, Algeria, Mauritania, and Western Sahara.

==Culture==

The countries of the Maghreb share many cultural similarities and traditions. Among these is a culinary tradition that Habib Bourguiba defined as Western Arab, where bread or couscous are the staple foods, as opposed to Eastern Arab, where bread, crushed wheat or white rice are the staple foods. In terms of food, some similarities beyond the starches are found throughout the Arab world.

Among other cultural and artistic traditions, jewellery of the Berber cultures worn by Amazigh women and made of silver, beads and other applications was a common trait of Berber identities in large areas of the Maghreb up to the second half of the 20th century.

In 2020, couscous was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

<text>Kabylia or Kabylie (; Kabyle: &quot;Tamurt n Leqbayel&quot; or &quot;Iqbayliyen&quot;, meaning &quot;Land of Kabyles&quot;, &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;Land of the Tribes&quot;) is a mountainous coastal region in northern Algeria and the homeland of the Kabyle people. It is part of the Tell Atlas mountain range and is located at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.

Kabylia covers two provinces of Algeria: Tizi Ouzou and Bejaia. Gouraya National Park and Djurdjura National Park are also located in Kabylia.

== Name ==
During the French colonization of Algeria, the French invented the term &#x27;Kabylia&#x27;, a term never used by the Arab and Berber populations of Algeria prior to the French invasion. The word &#x27;Kabyle&#x27; is a distortion of the Arabic word &quot;qaba&#x27;il&quot; (قبائل) which has two meanings, the first one is tribes that live among sedentary populations and the second is &#x27;to accept&#x27;, which Arabs after the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb used for local populations that accepted Islam.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Kabylia was a part of the Kingdom of Numidia (202 BC – 46 BC).

===Middle Ages===
The history of Kabylie started to appear in the classical books during the fourth century AD with the revolt of the commander Firmus and his brother Guildon against the empire.

The Vandals, a Germanic people, established a kingdom in North Africa in 435. Their rule lasted for 99 years until they were conquered by the Byzantine Empire in 534. The surviving Vandals then assimilated into the native Berber population. During the rule of the Romans, Vandals and Byzantines, the Kabyle people were some of the few Imazighen in North Africa who remained independent. During the Arab conquest of North Africa, the Kabyles were able to temporarily control and possess their mountains, It was not until 1857 that Kabylia as a whole was fully and entirely conquered and subdued by France.

Between 902 and 909 AD, after being converted to Isma&#x27;ilism and won over by Abu Abdallah&#x27;s dawah, the Kutama Berbers from Little Kabylie helped contribute to the founding of the Fatimid Caliphate, whose support in the conquest of Ifriqiya resulted in the creation of the Caliphate, although the ruling Fatimid dynasty was Arab. After the conquest of Ifriqiya, the Fatimids conquered the realm of the Rustamids on the way to Sijilmasa which they also briefly conquered. There the imprisoned Abdullāh al-Mahdī Billah was freed, accepted as the Imam of the movement, and installed as the first Caliph and founder of the ruling dynasty. The historian Heinz Halm describes the early Fatimid state as being &quot;a hegemony of the Kutama and Sanhaja Berbers over the eastern and central Maghrib&quot; and Loimeier states that rebellions against the Fatimids were also expressed through protest and opposition to Kutama rule. The weakening of the Abbasids allowed Fatimid-Kutama power to quickly expand and in 959 Ziri ibn Manad, Jawhar the Sicilian and a Kutama army conquered Fez and Sijilmassa in Morocco. 
 During the reign of al-Aziz Billah, the role of the Kutama in the Fatimid army was greatly weakened as he significantly reduced their size in the army and included new socio-military groups. In 969 under the command of Jawhar, the Fatimid troops conquered Egypt from the Ikhsidids, the general Ja&#x27;far ibn Fallah was instrumental in this success: he led the troops that crossed the river Nile and according to al-Maqrizi, captured the boats used to do this from a fleet sent by Ikhshidid loyalists from Lower Egypt. The general Ja’far then invaded Palestine and conquered Ramla, the capital, he then conquered Damascus and made himself the master of the city and then he moved north and conquered Tripoli. It was around this time period that the Fatimid Caliphate reached its territorial peak of 4,100,000 km2.

A Berber family emerged as formidable leaders in the unique Berber form of elected delegates form of government (through financial contribution and thus influence), the Zirids. Beyond their immediate Zirid territory (&quot;aarch&quot;/Congregation), another &quot;aarch&quot; and family Hammadid and its associates emerged in Kabylia with influence covering most of today&#x27;s Algeria, whereas the Zirid&#x27;s territory extended eastward to cover the area of modern Tunisia. Both the Hammadid and Zirid empires as well as the Fatimids established their rule in the Maghreb countries. The Zirids ruled land in what is now Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Spain, Malta and Italy. The Hammadids captured and held important regions such as Ouargla, Constantine, Sfax, Susa, Algiers, Tripoli and Fez establishing their rule in every country in the Maghreb region. The Fatimids conquered all of North Africa as well as Sicily and parts of the Middle East.

===Regency of Algiers===
During the Regency of Algiers, most of Kabylia was independent. Kabylia was split into two main kingdoms, the Kingdom of Kuku in modern Tizi Ouzou, and the Kingdom of Ait Abbas in modern Béjaïa.

===French colonisation and resistance===

Though the region was the last stronghold against French colonization, the area was gradually taken over by the French after 1830, despite vigorous local resistance by the local population led by leaders such as Faḍma n Sumer and Cheikh Mokrani, until the Battle of Icheriden in 1857 marked a decisive French victory, with sporadic outbursts of violence continuing as late as Mokrani&#x27;s rebellion in 1871. Much land was confiscated in this period from the more recalcitrant tribes and given to French &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;. Many arrests and deportations were carried out by the French in response to uprisings, mainly to New Caledonia (hence the origins of the Algerians of the Pacific.) Colonization also resulted in an acceleration of the emigration into other areas of the country and outside of it.

Algerian migrant workers in France organized the first party promoting independence in the 1920s. Messali Hadj, Imache Amar, Si Djilani, and Belkacem Radjef rapidly built a strong following throughout France and Algeria in the 1930s and actively trained militants who became key players during the struggle for independence and in building an independent Algerian state.

French colonists invented the Kabyle myth in the 19th century which asserted that the Kabyle people were more predisposed than Arabs to assimilate into &quot;French civilization.&quot; Lacoste explained that &quot;turning the Arabs into invaders was one way of legitimizing the French presence&quot;. Prior to the creation of the term in the 1840s, Kabyles throughout the centuries were actively and fully assimilated into the Arab culture of Algeria.

=== In the Algerian War ===
During the War of Independence (1954–1962), the FLN and ALN&#x27;s reorganisation of the country created, for the first time, a unified Kabyle administrative territory, wilaya III, being as it was at the centre of the anti-colonial struggle. As such, along with the Aurès, it was one of the most affected areas because of the importance of the maquis (aided by the mountainous terrain) and the high levels of support and collaboration of its inhabitants for the nationalist cause. Several historic leaders of the FLN came from this region, including Hocine Aït Ahmed, Abane Ramdane, and Krim Belkacem. It was also in Kabylia that the Soummam conference took place in 1956, the first of the FLN. The flipside of being such a critical region for the independence movement was being one of the major target of French counter-insurgency operations, not least the devastation of agricultural lands, looting, destruction of villages, population displacement, the creation of forbidden zones, etc.

=== After independence ===

From the moment of independence, tensions had already developed between Kabyle leaders and the central government, with the Socialist Forces Front (FFS) party of Hocine Aït Ahmed, strong in wilayas III and IV (Kabylie and Algiers), opposing the FLN&#x27;s Political Bureau centred around the person of Ahmed Ben Bella, who in turn relied upon the forces of the border army group within the ALN commanded by Houari Boumediene. The Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (based in Tizi Ouzou) was defeated by the Oujda Group led by Ahmed Ben Bella in the 1962 Algerian crisis. As early as 1963 the FFS called into question the authority of the single-party system, which resulted in two years of armed confrontation in the region. The rebellion was defeated, leaving more than four hundred dead, and most of the FLN leaders from Kabylia and the eastern provinces either executed or forced into exile.
In April 1980, following the banning of a conference by writer Mouloud Mammeri on traditional Kabyle poetry, riots and strikes broke out in Tizi Ouzou, followed by several months of demonstrations on university campuses in Kabylia and Algiers, known as the Berber Spring, demanding the officialisation and recognition of the Tamazight language. These resulted in the extrajudicial imprisonment of thousands of Kabylie intellectuals, along with other clashes in Tizi-Ouzou and Algiers in 1984 and 1985. With the opening up and establishment of the multi-party system in 1989, the RCD (Rally for Culture and Democracy) party was created by Saïd Sadi, at the same time as identity politics and the cultural awakening of the Kabylians were intensifying in reaction to the increasingly hard-line Arabization. In the midst of the civil war, there was an act of massive civil disobedience beginning in September 1994 and lasting the entire school year until mid 1995 where the ten-million strong population of Kabylia conducted a total school boycott, known as the &quot;schoolbag strike&quot;. In June and July 1998 the region flared up again after the assassination of protest singer and political activist Lounès Matoub at the same time that a law requiring the use of Arabic in all fields of education entered into force, further worsening tensions.

Following the death in April 2001 of Massinissa Guermah, a young high school student, in police custody, major riots took place, known as the Black Spring, in which 123 people died and some two thousand were wounded as a result of the authorities&#x27; violent crackdown. Eventually, the government was compelled to negotiate with the Arouch, a confederation of ancestral local councils over the situation, alongside wider issues such as social justice and the economy, which was deemed by the government as &#x27;regionalist&#x27; and dangerous for national unity and cohesion. Nevertheless, Tamazight was recognised in 2002 as a national language of Algeria, and as of 7 February 2016, an official language of the State alongside Arabic.

The Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie (MAK), founded in June 2001, has called for self-government for the region since 2011. The MAK was renamed as &quot;Mouvement pour l&#x27;Autodétermination de la Kabylie&quot; seeking independence from Algeria.

==Geography==

Main features:
* Greater Kabylia, which runs from Thénia (west) to Bejaia (east), and from the Mediterranean Sea (north) to the Soummam Valley (south), that is to say, 200 km by 100 km, beginning 50 km from Algiers, the capital of Algeria.
* Lesser Kabylia, comprising Kabylia of Bibans and Kabylia of Babors.

Three large chains of mountains occupy most of the area:
* In the north, the mountain range of maritime Kabylia, culminating with Tifrit n&#x27;Ait El Hadj (Tamgout 1278 m)
* In the south, the Djurdjura, dominating the valley of Soummam, culminating with Lalla-Khedidja (2308 m)
* Between the two lies the mountain range of Agawa, which is the most populous and is 800 m high on average. The largest town of Great Kabylia, Tizi Ouzou, lies in that mountain range. At Iraten (formerly &quot;Fort-National&quot; in French occupation), which numbered 28,000 inhabitants in 2001, is the highest urban centre of the area.

==Ecology==

There are a number of flora and fauna associated with this region. Notable is a population of the endangered primate, Barbary macaque, &quot;Macaca sylvanus&quot;, whose prehistoric range encompassed a much wider span than the present limited populations in Algeria, Morocco and Gibraltar.

==Population==
The area is populated by Kabyles, a Berber ethnic group. They speak the Kabyle language, the largest Berber language in Algeria. It is spoken by 3 million people and has significant Arabic, French, Latin, Greek, Phoenician and Punic substratum, with Arabic loanwords representing 35% to 46% of the total Kabyle vocabulary.

Since the Berber Spring in 1980, Kabyles have been at the forefront of the fight for recognition of the Berber language as an official one in Algeria (see Languages of Algeria).

==Zawiyas==

The &quot;Kabylia&quot; region is home to dozens of zawiyas affiliated with the Rahmaniyya Sufi brotherhood, including the following:
* &quot;Zawiya Thaalibia&quot; in the Issers.
* &quot;Zawiyet Sidi Boumerdassi&quot; in Tidjelabine.
* &quot;Zawiyet Sidi Boushaki&quot; in Thenia.
* &quot;Zawiyet Sidi Amar Cherif&quot; in Sidi Daoud.
* &quot; in Aafir.
* &quot; in Beni Amrane.
* &quot; in Khemis El-Khechna.
* &quot; in Boudouaou.

==Economy==
The traditional economy of the area is based on arboriculture (orchards, olive trees) and on the craft industry (tapestry or pottery). The mountain and hill farming is gradually giving way to local industry (textile and agro-alimentary).

Today Kabylia is one of the most industrialised parts of Algeria. Kabylia produces less than 15% of Algerian GDP (excluding oil and gas). Industries include: pharmaceutical industry in Bgayet Bejaia, agro-alimentary in Ifri and Akbou, mechanical industry in Tizi Ouzou and other small towns of western Kabylia, and petrochemical industry and oil refining in Bgayet Bejaia.

Bgayet (Bejaia)&#x27;s port is the second biggest in Algeria after Algiers, and the 6th largest on the Mediterranean Sea.

<text>Bradley University is a private university in Peoria, Illinois, United States. Founded in 1897, Bradley University enrolls 5,200 students who are pursuing degrees in more than 100 undergraduate programs and more than 30 graduate programs in five colleges. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and 22 specialized and professional accreditors.

==History==

 The Bradley Polytechnic Institute was founded by philanthropist Lydia Moss Bradley in 1897 in memory of her husband, Tobias, and their six children, all of whom died before Bradley, leaving her a childless widow. As a first step toward her goal, in 1892 she purchased a controlling interest in Parsons Horological School in LaPorte, Indiana, the first school for watchmakers in America and moved it to Peoria. She specified in her will that the school should be expanded after her death to include a classical education as well as industrial arts and home economics.

In October 1896, Mrs. Bradley was introduced to William Rainey Harper, president of the University of Chicago. He convinced her to move ahead with her plans and establish the school during her lifetime. Bradley Polytechnic Institute was chartered on November 13, 1896. Mrs. Bradley provided of land, $170,000 for buildings, equipment, and a library, and $30,000 per year for operating expenses. Harper served as president of both institutions (Chicago and Bradley) for some years.

Fourteen faculty and 150 students began classes in Bradley Hall on October 4, 1897 with construction workers still onsite. The Horological Department added another eight faculty and 70 students. Bradley Polytechnic Institute was formally dedicated on October 8, 1897. Its first graduate, in June 1898, was Cora Unland.

Originally, the institute was organized as a four-year academy as well as a two-year college. By 1899 the institute had expanded to accommodate nearly 500 pupils, and study fields included biology, chemistry, food work, sewing, English, German, French, Latin, Greek, history, manual arts, drawing, mathematics, and physics. By 1920 the institute dropped the academy orientation and adopted a four-year collegial program. Enrollment continued to grow over the coming decades and the name Bradley University was adopted in 1946.

The first music building on Bradley&#x27;s campus, Constance Hall, was built in 1930. In 1962 the building was renovated to become the music building of Bradley&#x27;s Campus.

This building is home to Bradley&#x27;s College of Education and Health Sciences. In March 2010, this building underwent a $24 million renovation was completed in June 2012. This renovation increased the building to four stories tall, consisting of academic classrooms and offices.

The Turner School of Entrepreneurship and Innovation is named in honor of Bob and Carolyn Turner, long-time supporters of Bradley. The Turners established the Robert and Carolyn Turner Center for Entrepreneurship in 2002. Gerald Hills, the school&#x27;s founding academic executive director, received the Karl Vesper Entrepreneurship Pioneer Award in 2012 and the Babson Lifetime Award in 2011. Hills served as the Turner Chair of Entrepreneurship until he retired in December 2014.

The program of physical therapy offers a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree.

===Tuition and financial aid===
As of the 2022-2023 school year, students who are enrolled full-time at Bradley University pay $39,248 for tuition. Students living in the residence halls on campus pay an additional $12,850 for room and board, along with a $432 activity and health fee.

There are several fraternities and sororities on and off campus. In 2003, Bradley University student and member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, Robert Schmalz (age 22), died after drinking excessive amounts of alcohol continuously over several days.

<text>The Republic of Stellaland () was, from 1882 to 1883, a Boer republic located in an area of British Bechuanaland (now in South Africa&#x27;s North West Province), west of the Transvaal. After unification with the neighbouring State of Goshen, it became the United States of Stellaland () from 1883 to 1885.

During its short history, the small state became a focal point for conflict between the British Empire and the South African Republic, the two major players vying for control of the territory. After a series of claims and annexations, British fears of Boer expansionism led to its demise and, among other factors, set the stage for the Second Boer War.

==Background==
Before the proclamation of the republic, the area was under the control of competing Korana and Tswana groups, while the United Kingdom laid claim to it as a part of the emerging protectorate of British Bechuanaland. Two of the indigenous groups were under the leadership of chiefs Mankoroane and Montšioa, whom the British regarded as &quot;friendly,&quot; and two others under the leadership of chiefs Moshette (a Motswana) and Massouw (a Korana). When a feud erupted between Mankoroane and another chief, each side resorted to recruiting volunteers, promising them land in return for their assistance. After a settlement was negotiated with mediation from the Transvaal Republic, large portions of Mankoroane&#x27;s land with 416 farms of 3,000 morgen (2,563 ha) each were given to Boer mercenaries who had fought on his adversary&#x27;s side, and the new inhabitants decided to declare independence.

==Unification==

The Republic of Stellaland was created on 26 July 1882, under the leadership of its elected president Gerrit Jacobus van Niekerk, a farmer from Transvaal, and was given the name &quot;Stellaland&quot; (Star Land) in reference to a comet that was visible in the skies at the time. The town of Vryburg was founded and declared its capital. At its founding, the new country covered an area of and was home to an estimated population of 20,500 individuals, 3,000 of whom were of European ancestry.

The State of Goshen, named after the biblical Land of Goshen, was founded by Nicolaas Claudius Gey van Pittius in October 1882 in the neighbouring area called &quot;Rooigrond&quot; with the approval of chief Moshette. Goshen had an estimated population of 17,000, of whom approximately 2,000 were of European origin, and covered an area of .

In 1883, Stellaland merged with Goshen to form the United States of Stellaland.

==Status==
Whether or not the independence of any of these states was ever recognised by another country is not clear. In Stellaland&#x27;s favour, one can point out that the Montevideo convention which formalised the definition of sovereignty in the modern sense would not be signed until 1933, and that the local chiefs approved its existence. On the other hand, several British sources refer to Van Niekerk and his followers as &quot;freebooters&quot; and &quot;marauders&quot;. A telegram erroneously sent by Sir Charles Warren, military commander for British Bechuanaland, to Van Niekerk endorsed Cecil Rhodes&#x27; settlement in Stellaland. Only later did Warren realise that his wording could be interpreted as an implicit acknowledgement of Stellaland&#x27;s legality, and he denied that the message had such implications. In February 1884, Great Britain unilaterally declared the area a British protectorate.

Stellaland&#x27;s laws and constitution were practically identical to those of the South African Republic. It never issued an independent currency, but instead—like all the surrounding states—used the South African pound; it did, however, print its own postage stamps beginning in February 1884 which are still traded among collectors to the present day.

==Annexation==
Because Van Niekerk&#x27;s government had announced its intention to levy taxes on all trade going through its territory, Cecil Rhodes, founder of the De Beers diamond company, and the British administration feared a setback for their endeavours in the mining business, because Stellaland lay on one of the main trade routes. It was also presumed that the small country could eventually be incorporated into the neighbouring South African Republic in an effort to circumvent the Pretoria Convention of 1881 which called for an end to Boer expansionism.

Rhodes even asserted that the area was of such a crucial nature to the Crown that if the territory held by Stellaland remained under Boer control, British presence &quot;should fall from the position of a paramount state in South Africa to that of a minor state.&quot; These fears were fuelled when, on 10 September 1884, President Paul Kruger of Transvaal declared the area to be under the protection of the South African Republic and annexed it six days later. In December 1884 the British sent in a force under Sir Charles Warren, who invaded the country and abolished the republic in August of the following year before it was incorporated into British Bechuanaland.

<doc id="346029" wikidata="Q192955" url="?curid=346029" title="Steve Nash">
<text>Stephen John Nash (born 7 February 1974) is a Canadian professional basketball coach and former player who most recently served as head coach of the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played 18 seasons in the NBA, where he was an eight-time All-Star and a seven-time All-NBA selection. Nash was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player while playing for the Phoenix Suns.

Nash grew up playing several different sports, and after a successful high school basketball career in British Columbia, he earned a scholarship to Santa Clara University in California. In his four seasons with the Broncos, the team made three NCAA tournament appearances, and he was twice named the West Coast Conference (WCC) Player of the Year. Nash graduated from Santa Clara as the team&#x27;s all-time leader in assists and was taken as the 15th pick in the 1996 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns. He had minimal impact and was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in 1998. By his fourth season with the Mavericks, he was voted to his first NBA All-Star Game and earned his first All-NBA selection. Together with Dirk Nowitzki and Michael Finley, Nash led the Mavericks to the Western Conference Finals the following season. He became a free agent after the and returned to the Phoenix Suns.

In the , Nash led the Suns to the Western Conference finals and was named the league&#x27;s MVP. He was named MVP again in the and was runner-up for a third consecutive MVP to Nowitzki in 2006–07. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest point guards of all time. Nash led the league in assists and free throw percentage at various points in his career. He is also ranked as one of the top players in NBA league history in three-point shooting, free throw shooting, total assists, and assists per game. In 2018, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

Nash has been honoured for his contributions to various philanthropic causes. In 2006, he was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Nash was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2007 and invested to the order in 2016, and was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Victoria in 2008. Nash has been a co-owner of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer (MLS) since the team entered the league in 2011. From 2012 to 2019, he served as general manager of the Canadian men&#x27;s national basketball team, for whom he played from 1991 to 2003, making one Olympic appearance and being twice named FIBA AmeriCup MVP. In 2021, Nash was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

==Early life==
Nash was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a Welsh mother, Jean, and English father, John, on 7 February 1974. His family moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, when he was 18 months old, before settling in Victoria, British Columbia. He, therefore, holds British as well as Canadian citizenship. Before the family settled in Canada, his father played professional soccer in various parts of the world. Nash often played soccer and ice hockey with his younger brother Martin, and he did not start playing basketball until he was 12 or 13 years old; he also played rugby and lacrosse. In grade eight, he told his mother that one day he would play in the NBA and become a star. He was a neighbour to future NHL stars Russ and Geoff Courtnall, who used to babysit him and played soccer coached by Nash&#x27;s father.

Nash originally attended Mount Douglas Secondary School in Saanich, British Columbia, but after his grades began to drop, his parents decided to enroll him at St. Michaels University School, a private school in Victoria. There, he starred in basketball, soccer, and rugby union. While playing basketball during his senior season, Nash averaged 21.3 points, 11.2 assists, and 9.1 rebounds per game. In the 1991–92 season, he led his team in his final year to the British Columbia AAA provincial championship title, and was named the province&#x27;s Player of the Year.

==College career==
Although Nash&#x27;s high school coach, Ian Hyde-Lay, sent letters of inquiry and highlight reels to over 30 American universities, Nash was not recruited by any university, until Santa Clara coach Dick Davey requested video footage of the young guard. After watching Nash in person, Davey said he &quot;was nervous as hell just hoping that no one else would see him. It didn&#x27;t take a Nobel Prize winner to figure out this guy&#x27;s pretty good. It was just a case of hoping that none of the big names came around.&quot; However, Davey also told Nash he was &quot;the worst defensive player&quot; he had ever seen.

Nash was awarded a scholarship by Santa Clara for the 1992–93 season. At the time, it had been five years since the Broncos appeared in the NCAA tournament. That changed when Nash led the Broncos to a WCC tournament title and an upset win over the 2 seeded Arizona in the first round of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. In that game, Nash scored six straight free throws in the last 30 seconds of the contest. Although Temple defeated Santa Clara in the next round, the 1992–93 campaign was considered a successful one. However, the Broncos failed to sustain the momentum the following season and only managed a 5–7 record in the conference. The team rebounded in the 1994–95 season, with Nash being named Conference Player of the Year and the Broncos topping the WCC. Featuring the league leader for scoring and assists in Nash, the Broncos returned to the NCAA tournament, but Mississippi State defeated them. After the season, Nash contemplated turning professional and decided against it when he learned that he would probably not be considered as a first-round pick in the 1995 NBA draft.

In the 1995–96 season, Nash began attracting the attention of the national media and professional scouts. He had spent the previous summer honing his skills, playing with the Canadian national team and working out with established NBA players Jason Kidd and Gary Payton. Santa Clara again captured the WCC title, and for the second consecutive year, Nash was named Conference Player of the Year, the first Bronco to repeat since Kurt Rambis. He scored 28 points in leading the No. 10 seed Broncos to a first-round upset win over No. 7 seed Maryland, but then the Broncos were eliminated by Kansas. Nash&#x27;s performances ensured that he earned an honourable mention All-America as a senior by The Associated Press and the USBWA. He also finished his career as Santa Clara&#x27;s all-time leader in assists (510), free throw percentage (.862), and made and attempted three-pointers (263–656). He remains third on the school&#x27;s all-time scoring list (1,689) and holds Santa Clara&#x27;s single-season free throw percentage record (.894). In September 2006, Nash&#x27;s jersey was retired, becoming the first Santa Clara student-athlete to receive that honour.

==Professional career==

===Phoenix Suns (1996–1998)===
After graduating with a degree in sociology, Nash was selected 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 1996 NBA draft. Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player. This was because despite his impressive college accomplishments, Nash had not played in one of the major college conferences. A major influence in Phoenix&#x27;s choice was assistant coach Donnie Nelson, who met Nash back in high school as he was coached by Nelson&#x27;s friend Ken Shields, and would eventually befriend the player as he played in Santa Clara. During his first two seasons in the NBA, Nash played a supporting role behind NBA star point guards Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell, and later, Jason Kidd. Both Johnson and Cassell had NBA Finals experience, while Kidd was the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft and already an All-Star when he arrived at Phoenix.

In his rookie season, Nash only managed 10.5 minutes a game, but in his second season, his playing time increased significantly and he was even ranked 13th in the league for three-point field-goal percentage. Nevertheless, the Canadian&#x27;s tenure with the Suns did not last. Nelson had just taken a job as assistant general manager of the Dallas Mavericks under his father, Don Nelson, and convinced him to acquire the under-utilised Nash. Following the 1998 NBA draft, Nash was traded from the Suns to the Mavericks in exchange for Martin Müürsepp, Bubba Wells, the draft rights to Pat Garrity and a first-round draft pick (who later turned out to be future Phoenix teammate Shawn Marion).

===Dallas Mavericks (1998–2004)===
It was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard, beginning a decade as one of the game&#x27;s top players. During his first year as a Maverick (the lockout-shortened ) he started in all 40 games he played in, and averaged 7.9 points, 2.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game. The 19–31 Mavericks failed to make the 1999 playoffs, but in the 1999–2000 season, the team&#x27;s prospects improved considerably. Nash missed 25 mid-season games due to an ankle injury, but came back to record six double-doubles in the last month of play. He finished the season with averages of 8.6 points and 4.9 assists per game. More importantly for the team, second-year teammate and friend Dirk Nowitzki was blossoming quickly into a top player, veteran Michael Finley was having an All-Star-calibre year, and the team&#x27;s new owner, billionaire Mark Cuban, was bringing new energy and excitement to the franchise. Nash now had a supportive environment in which he could thrive.

In the , Nash averaged 15.6 points and 7.3 assists per game in a breakout season. With Nash directing the team&#x27;s offense, Nowitzki and Finley playing at their best, and the acquisition of All-Star Juwan Howard complementing the high-scoring trio, the Mavericks earned a playoff berth for the first time in more than a decade. Dallas lost in the Western Conference Semifinals four games to one to the San Antonio Spurs, but it marked the beginning of a memorable run for Nash and the Mavericks. In the , Nash posted career-highs of 17.9 points and 7.7 assists per game and earned a spot in the NBA All-Star Game and on the All-NBA Third Team. He was now an All-Star, increasingly appearing in television commercials and, with Finley and Nowitzki, a part of the Dallas Mavericks &quot;Big Three&quot;. Dallas earned another trip to the playoffs but lost again in the Semifinals to the Sacramento Kings four games to one.

Nash closely replicated his previous season&#x27;s performance in the , averaging 17.7 points and 7.3 assists per game, again earning All-Star and All-NBA Third Team honours. Nowitzki and Nash led the Mavericks from a 14-game winning streak to open the season all the way to the Western Conference finals, where they lost to the eventual NBA champions, the San Antonio Spurs four games to two. It was only the second Conference finals appearance in the franchise&#x27;s history. The saw an offensively boosted Mavericks roster (with the acquisitions of Antoine Walker and Antawn Jamison) but a dip in Nash&#x27;s scoring contributions. As a result, he was not selected for the All-Star and All-NBA team rosters even though he achieved new career highs in assists per game (8.8) and free throw accuracy (91.6%). In the 2004 playoffs, the fifth-seeded Dallas failed to make progress yet again as the Sacramento Kings saw them off four games to one.

After the 2003–04 season, Nash became a free agent. He attempted to negotiate a long-term contract with Cuban, who was paying Walker, Finley, Nowitzki and Jamison nearly $50 million in combined salaries that season. Cuban wanted to build his franchise around the younger Nowitzki and did not want to risk signing the 30-year-old Nash to a long-term deal, and offered Nash a four-year deal worth about $9 million annually, with a fifth year partially guaranteed. The Phoenix Suns on the other hand offered the point guard a six-year, $63 million contract. Nash was reluctant to leave Dallas and returned to Cuban to see if he would match the deal; Cuban did not, and Nash signed with the Suns for the . The Canadian would go on to win two League MVP awards with Phoenix, and on a 14 June 2006 appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, Cuban wondered out loud, &quot;...you know Steve&#x27;s a great guy and I love him to death, but why couldn&#x27;t he play like an MVP for us?&quot;

===Return to Phoenix (2004–2012)===

====2004–05 season====

Nash joined a Suns team which had emerging young players in Shawn Marion, Joe Johnson, and Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire. In the season before Nash arrived, the Suns had recorded a 29–53 win–loss record, and they were projected to have another poor season. Head coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni favoured an up-tempo style of basketball; this required smaller and more athletic players with the capability to outrun and outshoot their opponents. On 21 November 2004, Nash recorded 22 points, 18 assists and 4 steals in a 122–111 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. Nash&#x27;s familiarity with this style combined with the athleticism of his teammates produced an NBA-best 62–20 record and a points-per-game average of 110.4, the highest in a decade. The catalyst of this turnaround, Nash averaged 11.5 assists per game while making 50.2% of his field goals and 43.1% of his three-pointers in the regular season. He edged Shaquille O&#x27;Neal to win the NBA MVP award, becoming the first Canadian to earn the honour, as well as the third point guard ever to be named MVP, along with Magic Johnson and Bob Cousy. In the 2005 playoffs, Phoenix swept the Memphis Grizzlies in four games before meeting the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. Nash led the Suns to a 4–2 series win, and the Suns reached the Western Conference finals for the first time since 1993, but lost to the eventual NBA Champions and arch-rival, the San Antonio Spurs, in five games.

====2005–06 season====
In the next season, Stoudemire suffered a serious knee injury, and Johnson and Quentin Richardson were traded away. The Suns were not expected to repeat their successful 2005 season, but with Nash directing the same high-tempo offence, the team compiled a respectable 54–28 record and won the division title. On 2 January 2006, Nash recorded 28 points, 5 rebounds and 22 assists in a 140–133 triple overtime loss to the New York Knicks. The Suns were again the highest-scoring team in the league with seven players averaging double figures in points per game, and Nash was voted for the first time to start for the 2006 Western All-Star team. In the last game of the season, Nash recorded a triple-double of 16 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in a 106–96 road win over the Trail Blazers.
Having recorded career highs in points (18.8), rebounds (4.2), field goal percentage (.512) and free throw percentage (a league-leading .921), and leading the league with 10.5 assists per game, Nash was named the league MVP for the second year in a row. In the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Phoenix overcame a 3–1 deficit against the Los Angeles Lakers and won the series 4–3. The Los Angeles Clippers were their Conference semifinals opponents, and the Suns again needed seven games to clinch the series. For the second year in a row, however, the Suns bowed out in the conference finals, this time to Nash&#x27;s former team, Dallas.

====2006–07 season====
In the , Nash had another stellar campaign, averaging 18.6 points and a career-high 11.6 assists per game while becoming the first person since Magic Johnson in to average 18 points and 11 assists per game during the regular season. Nash received the most votes for first-team All-NBA and was joined by teammate Stoudemire; the two were the first teammates to make the first team since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in . Nash received 129 first-place votes and 645 total points from the panel of 129 media members. He narrowly missed being MVP a third consecutive time, coming in second with 44 first place votes to 83 for Dirk Nowitzki. In the 2007 playoffs, the Suns eliminated the Lakers in five games before losing 4–2 to the Spurs in the conference semifinals.

====2007–08 season====

Nash played in 81 regular season games during the ; in this campaign, the Western Conference was especially competitive and he led the Suns to 55 wins and the sixth seed for the 2008 playoffs. Although there was a dip in his regular season output, Nash&#x27;s shooting remained sharp; the accuracy of his shooting was on par with his 2005–06 MVP campaign (shooting at least 50% from the field, 40% from the three-point arc, and 90% from the free throw line). On 31 January 2008, he collected his All-Star stripes for the sixth time in his career. However, Nash continued to experience agony in the playoffs. Despite a mid-season trade that sent Shawn Marion to the Miami Heat and brought four-time NBA champion Shaquille O&#x27;Neal to the team, the Suns were defeated in the first round of the 2008 playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs for the third time in four years. In the deciding Game 5, Nash was perceived to have suffered from &quot;elimination-game jitters&quot;, and turned over the ball twice in the final two minutes of what was a tight contest. Nevertheless, Nash was later named to the All-NBA Second Team for the 2007–08 season.

====2008–09 season====
Before the began, coach D&#x27;Antoni was replaced by Terry Porter, who preferred a more defensive-oriented style of basketball. The Suns had difficulties adapting to this new system, and even a December trade involving sending stalwarts Raja Bell and Boris Diaw to the Charlotte Bobcats for athletic swingman Jason Richardson saw the team continue to struggle. Porter was then replaced by Alvin Gentry in February after a 28–23 record, but the Suns were unable to secure the final seed for the 2009 playoffs, resulting in Nash missing the playoffs for the first time since he returned to Phoenix for his second stint.

====2009–10 season====

Nash and the Suns opened the with a series of strong performances, going 8–1 in their first nine games (a franchise-best since ), with Nash producing two 20-assists games. On 21 January 2010, Nash was named as the starting point guard for the West for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. With him operating at the point, the Suns were the highest-scoring team in the league for the fifth season in a row, and were seeded third in the conference for the 2010 playoffs with 54 wins. Behind solid performances by Richardson and veteran Grant Hill, the Suns defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 4–2 in the first round of the playoffs, and swept the Spurs 4–0 in the second round. The Suns met the defending champions, Los Angeles Lakers, in the conference finals. After losing the first two games, Phoenix won the next two to tie the series. A Ron Artest buzzer-beater in Game 5 pushed the Lakers one game closer to the Finals, and Kobe Bryant&#x27;s 37 points in Game 6 completed the defeat of the Suns.

====2010–11 season====
The Suns underwent two major roster changes in the . During the pre-season, Stoudemire left for New York, while longtime teammate Leandro Barbosa was traded for Hedo Türkoğlu. Josh Childress, and Hakim Warrick were also recruited to join the Suns. Not long after the season began, Türkoğlu, Richardson, and Earl Clark were traded to Orlando for Vince Carter, Marcin Gortat, and Mickaël Piétrus, while rising star Goran Dragić was traded to the Houston Rockets for Aaron Brooks. The Suns had difficulty being even a .500 team, and for the second time since Nash returned to Phoenix, the Suns failed to make the 2011 playoffs.

====2011–12 season====
In February 2012, Nash was named to his eighth All-Star Game. At the time, he was leading the NBA in assists per game. On 21 April 2012, Nash passed Oscar Robertson for career assists versus the Denver Nuggets. Despite his stellar play the Suns missed the 2012 playoffs for the second consecutive time. He finished the season averaging 12.5 points and 10.7 assists per game on 53.2% shooting from the field (tying his career high). Near the end of the 2011–12 season, Nash was named the winner of the PBWA&#x27;s Magic Johnson Award.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2012–2015)===

====2012–13 season====

On 11 July 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Nash in a sign-and-trade deal with Phoenix. Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto, but he decided that Los Angeles was the best fit for him and his family. Nash switched his jersey number, as his customary No. 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain. Nash, an avid soccer fan, chose No. 10 to pay homage to Glenn Hoddle, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and other soccer playmakers who wore the number. Entering his 17th NBA season, Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back.

In the second game of the 2012–13 season, Nash suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left leg after a collision with Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers. He was expected to miss at least one week, but was out of the lineup for close to seven weeks. He was reunited with D&#x27;Antoni, who took over as Lakers coach after Mike Brown was fired after a 1–4 start. On 22 December, Nash returned against the Golden State Warriors, helping the Lakers win their first overtime game of the season, 118–115, scoring 12 points with 9 assists in 41 minutes of play. The Lakers won three of the first four games after Nash returned. However, they lost their next four, including a 125–112 loss to Houston on 8 January 2013, when Nash assisted on an Antawn Jamison jumper to become the fifth player in NBA history to reach 10,000 career assists.

Kobe Bryant was moved to defend the opponent&#x27;s primary ball handler, freeing Nash from unfavourable matchups. Nash also struggled with Dwight Howard to run the pick and roll, a play that D&#x27;Antoni had expected would be a staple for the Lakers. D&#x27;Antoni moved Nash off the ball and made him more of a spot-up shooter, while Bryant became the primary facilitator on offense. Nash missed the last eight games of the season with a right hip injury that had also caused nerve damage in his right hamstring. The team qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed, but were swept 4–0 by San Antonio in the first round. Nash missed the last two games of the series after recurring issues with his hip and hamstring. In what he called arguably &quot;the most frustrating&quot; season of his career, Nash missed a career-high 32 games in the regular season, and averaged his fewest assists (6.7) since 1999–2000, when he was a part-time starter with Dallas.

====2013–14 season====

During the 2013–14 season, Nash continued to suffer nerve problems stemming from his leg injury the prior season. In November 2013, he was sidelined for an estimated minimum of two weeks due to nerve root irritation. Nash returned on 4 February 2014, shooting 3-for-6 for 7 points. On 7 February 2014, his 40th birthday, he scored a season-high 19 points in a victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. On 13 March, Nash was ruled out for the remainder of the season by D&#x27;Antoni. He was suffering from a recurrence of nerve problems stemming from an earlier collision to his left leg with Chicago&#x27;s Kirk Hinrich, and the Lakers wanted to give Kendall Marshall and Jordan Farmar more playing time. However, Nash returned on 21 March after a groin injury to Farmar that was expected to sideline him a minimum of two weeks.

====2014–15 season====
In July 2014, Nash announced that the 2014–15 season would be his last. During the preseason, he experienced back pain, and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage. On 23 October, less than a week before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash&#x27;s 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury. Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back. Nash spoke on injuring his back, stating: &quot;Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to not be able to do that right now. I work very hard to stay healthy, and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult. I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long-term health.&quot;

===Retirement and consulting duties===
Nash announced his retirement from playing on 21 March 2015. Before the announcement, the Cleveland Cavaliers told Nash&#x27;s agent that they were interested in having him as a backup for Kyrie Irving if Nash asked for a buyout. Nash refused it due to health concerns and his wanting to retire as a Laker in gratitude for the opportunity given by the club. Nash was later approached by another former team of his, the Dallas Mavericks, to have one last season with them instead, but he declined due to his aforementioned health concerns.

On 25 September 2015, it was confirmed that Nash would take on part-time consulting duties for the Golden State Warriors. During his first season with the team, the Warriors produced a record-breaking 73–9 season, although the team fell short in the 2016 NBA Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The next season, the Warriors would win the 2017 NBA Finals against the defending champions Cleveland Cavaliers, giving Nash his first NBA championship in any role.

On 19 December 2017, the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame announced that eligibility for induction into the Hall of Fame was decreased to three years after retirement, which allowed for Nash to be eligible to be enshrined in 2018. On 31 March 2018, during the Final Four, it was announced that Nash along with former teammates Jason Kidd and Grant Hill, as well as Ray Allen, Maurice Cheeks, and Charlie Scott would be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018. Nash was formally inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on 7 September 2018. In October 2021, Nash was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

==Coaching career==

===Brooklyn Nets (2020–2022)===
On 3 September 2020, Nash was announced as head coach of the Brooklyn Nets.

On 3 March 2021, Nash was named Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for February, becoming the first Nets head coach to earn the honor since his former teammate Jason Kidd won it twice in 2014. Nash led the Nets to an Eastern Conference-best record of 9–4 during the month, including a conference-best 5–2 road record. Nash led the Nets to a 48–24 record in his first season as head coach. After the 2020–21 regular season Nash finished in sixth place in the NBA Coach of the Year voting.

On 27 October 2022, Nash received two technical fouls and was ejected for arguing with and yelling at referees, during a 110–99 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On 1 November, Nash and the Nets agreed to part ways amid controversies revolving around the team&#x27;s players.

==National team career==
In the early 1990s, Nash was cut from the Canadian junior national team by head coach Ken Olynyk, the father of future NBA player Kelly Olynyk. At age 17, he was the youngest member of Team Canada at the 1991 Summer Universiade, where the team won a silver medal.

In 1993, while in college, he played for the senior national team at the Tournament of the Americas and competed in the Canada Games (for the British Columbia team) and Summer Universiade. He won a bronze medal at the Canada Games and won a silver medal at the Summer Universiade, losing to Team USA in a closely contested final, which included players such as Michael Finley and Damon Stoudamire.

At the 1999 Tournament of the Americas, Nash led Canada to the silver medal, qualifying the team for the Olympics for the first time in 12 years; he was named tournament MVP. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Nash led Canada to win their round robin group with a victory over Spain and a stunning 83–75 win over favoured Yugoslavia when he scored 26 points with eight rebounds and eight assists. Canada was eliminated in the quarterfinals with a five-point loss to France and Nash left the court in tears. Nash expressed disappointment with the result, saying &quot;It hurts a lot. I feel like I let everybody down. We could have been in the championship game. We were good enough.&quot; Nevertheless, he did see a possible silver lining, saying &quot;Hopefully kids [in Canada] will be inspired to play... that&#x27;s what I really hope.&quot; A victory in its final game of the tournament, a placement game against Russia, enabled Canada to salvage seventh place. Nash&#x27;s Olympic performance propelled him to stardom in Canada, and he finished fifth in voting for the 2000 Lionel Conacher Award, which is handed out to the Canadian male athlete of the year.

Nash again led Team Canada during qualifying for the 2004 Summer Olympics at the FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He led the tournament in assists and was named tournament MVP, but Canada finished fourth, missing out on the three Olympic spots available. That was the last time Nash played for Canada; he was reportedly upset about the firing of head coach Jay Triano in 2004. In December 2007, he said, &quot;In my mind right now, I&#x27;m not going to play for Canada any more.&quot;

On 8 May 2012, Nash became general manager of the Canadian senior national team. Three months later, he rehired Triano as head coach.

On 5 March 2019, Nash transitioned to a senior advisor role and was succeeded as general manager by Rowan Barrett, his former national team teammate.

==Player profile==

Nash was praised for his playmaking, ball-handling skills and shooting. He led the league in assists for five years, averaging 11.5 assists per game in 2004–05, 10.5 in 2005–06, 11.6 in 2006–07, 11.0 in 2009–10 and 11.4 in 2010–11 and won the NBA Skills Challenge in 2005 and 2010. As of the end of 2012–13 season, he had a 90.4% career free throw shooting average (formerly the best in NBA history, second to Stephen Curry) and a 42.8% career three-point shooting average (eighth-best in league history), and ranked as one of the top 10 players in league history in total assists, assists per game, and three-point field goals made. He is ranked second (starting from 1986–87 season) in regular season point–assist double doubles. In the 2005–06 season, Nash became the fourth player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better from the field, 40% from three-point range (43.9), and 90% from the line, joining Larry Bird, Reggie Miller, and Mark Price in the 50–40–90 club. Nash would repeat this feat three more times in the 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10 campaigns. Nash (four times), Larry Bird and Kevin Durant (two times each) are the only players to have accomplished this feat more than once.

A two-time NBA MVP, Nash is one of three point guards (along with Magic Johnson and Stephen Curry) to win the MVP award multiple times and one of four guards in NBA history to earn back-to-back MVPs (along with Johnson, Michael Jordan and Curry). Only 12 other NBA players have won back-to-back MVP awards: Johnson, Jordan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Nikola Jokić. On 12 January 2016, ESPN.com rated Nash as the seventh-best point guard of all time, and in a survey by nba.com in 2007, Nash received 85% of the votes by the league&#x27;s general managers as best point guard in the league. In a similar survey in 2009, Nash was rated as the best passer and the player possessing the best basketball IQ.

Commenting on Nash losing out to former teammate Dirk Nowitzki for the 2007 NBA MVP, Boston Celtics centre and Hall of Famer Russell stated: &quot;I think, on the world stage, he&#x27;s one of our great athletes in all sports... I&#x27;m a big fan. The two MVPs he got, he deserved. Part of the reason he&#x27;s so good and so effective is that the guys like playing with him. He creates an atmosphere where they win games.&quot;
Nash was particularly effective playing the pick and roll, especially with Nowitzki when he was with the Mavericks and later with the Suns&#x27; Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire and Shawn Marion under head coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni. When Nash returned to Phoenix in 2004, he helped the Suns improve from a 29–53 record in 2003–04 to 62–20 in 2004–05, reaching the conference finals for the first time in 11 years, and earning his first MVP award. The next season, he again led the Suns to the conference finals, despite the injuries of all three big men (Stoudemire, Kurt Thomas, and Brian Grant). Further, Nash was responsible for seven of his teammates attaining career-highs in season scoring. With Nash operating at the point between the 2005–06 and 2009–10 seasons, the Suns led the league in field goal percentage.
In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Nash as the 38th greatest player in NBA history.

==Sports ownership==
Nash had also previously made statements about his intention to bring Major League Soccer to Vancouver as early as 2011, which he has succeeded in doing. He joined the USL-1&#x27;s Vancouver Whitecaps team&#x27;s ownership group in July 2008, and in March 2009, Vancouver was officially named as a future MLS expansion city, set to join the league in 2011. Nash occasionally attends practice for his co-owned team, called Vancouver Whitecaps FC.

Nash, along with former Yahoo! president and fellow Victoria-native Jeff Mallett, were investors in Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer, a soccer league that was launched in March 2009 and folded in May 2012. Nash cited his twin daughters and wanting to have role models for them to look up to as a reason for supporting the league.

On 5 January 2016, it was announced that Nash was part of a group who purchased a $21 million stake in club Mallorca. The group also included Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver, Suns vice chairman Andy Kohlberg and former players of the United States national soccer team Stuart Holden and Kyle Martino.

On 21 June 2021, Nash along with Wayne Gretzky, Dustin Johnson and Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai became owners in the National Lacrosse League&#x27;s new Las Vegas franchise, the Las Vegas Desert Dogs.

==Off the court==
===Personal life===
In 2001, Nash met Alejandra Amarilla in New York City. They married in June 2005 and had twin daughters and a son. On the day of his son&#x27;s birth, Nash made a statement to &quot;Life &amp; Style&quot; in which he announced the birth but called it a &quot;bittersweet moment&quot;, revealing that he and his wife had &quot;lived separately for the past several months&quot; and were &quot;in the process of dissolving&quot; their marriage. In March 2016, Nash became engaged to Lilla Frederick, a former Pepperdine University and junior women&#x27;s U.S. team volleyball player. They married in September 2016. The couple have a son and a daughter.

In 2006, Nash was referenced in Canadian singer Nelly Furtado&#x27;s song &quot;Promiscuous&quot;, leading him to deny rumours that they were romantically involved. They both grew up in British Columbia.

Nash&#x27;s younger brother, Martin, played soccer for the Vancouver Whitecaps and made 30 appearances for the Canadian national soccer team. Their younger sister, Joann, was the captain of the University of Victoria Vikes women&#x27;s soccer team for three years and was named a Canada West Universities Athletic Association All-Star. She is married to former professional ice hockey player Manny Malhotra. Nash is the godfather of Toronto Raptors star RJ Barrett.

Nash has a medical condition called spondylolisthesis, which causes muscle tightness and back pain. Due to the condition, when he was not playing in basketball games, he would lie on his back rather than sit on the bench to keep his muscles from stiffening.

===Charity===
In 2001, Nash founded the Steve Nash Foundation. Through grants to public service and nonprofit entities, the foundation aims to foster health in kids by funding projects that provide services to children affected by poverty, illness, abuse, or neglect, and create opportunities for education, play, and empowerment. It focuses its resources on communities in Arizona and British Columbia, and was given charitable status in 2004. The foundation was awarded the Steve Patterson Award for Excellence in Sports Philanthropy in 2008. Nash also founded the Jim Jennings Memorial Endowment Fund, established in honour of a volunteer staff member at Santa Clara University who served the basketball team for more than 20 years.

Elsewhere, Nash sponsors the Steve Nash Youth Basketball League in British Columbia, which has grown over 10,000 participants. He also became involved with GuluWalk, a Canadian-operated charitable organization that raises awareness and funds for the war-affected children of northern Uganda. In September 2007, Nash and Yao Ming headlined a group of NBA players who travelled to China and played an exhibition game with the Chinese national basketball team. The charity event reportedly raised 2.5 million dollars, earmarked for Chinese children in need.

In May 2006, Nash was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In the accompanying write-up by Charles Barkley, Nash was lauded for his unselfishness on the basketball court, and being &quot;just a nice guy&quot; who had paid for a new pediatric cardiology ward in a Paraguayan hospital. On 28 December 2007, it was announced that Nash would receive Canada&#x27;s highest civilian honour, the Order of Canada, and on 3 June 2008, it was announced that Nash would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. On 18 September 2009, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Victoria for his athletic achievements and philanthropic work on the behalf of young people through the Steve Nash Foundation.

===Endorsements===
Nash is selective in his endorsements, preferring companies he deems socially responsible. After winning his first MVP award, he was approached to serve as spokesperson for numerous products, including MDG Computers, Raymond Weil watches, Vitamin Water, and Clearly Canadian bottled water. He also has a longstanding relationship with Nike. Nash is represented by agent Bill Duffy.

===Soccer===

Nash grew up playing soccer—he stated in a 2005 interview that he could have played professionally if he had focused on it—and continues to hold an interest in the sport. When Dirk Nowitzki arrived in the NBA from Germany, he and Nash became close friends, in part because they enjoyed watching soccer together. Nash is friends with several professional soccer players, including Alessandro Del Piero, Thierry Henry, Owen Hargreaves, Massimo Ambrosini and Steve McManaman. During his off-season, when he lives in New York City, he has trained with the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, and once tried to arrange a pick-up game in the city&#x27;s Central Park with the Red Bulls and one of his local teams.

Nash, whose father was born in the Tottenham district of London, is a lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter, and has expressed interest in owning a minority stake in the club. &quot;I&#x27;d like to be an owner. It&#x27;s something I could do for the rest of my life after my little window of popularity dies&quot;, he said in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Nash added, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a passionate supporter all my life. My parents are from north London and so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m some Yank who wants to make a profit out of football. I don&#x27;t care about making money. I just want to see Spurs succeed and, if I can help, that&#x27;s great.&quot; However, he said any participation in Spurs would come after his basketball career is over, and he has had only &quot;casual contact&quot; with chairman Daniel Levy and former director of football Damien Comolli. Nash is also a fan of Spain&#x27;s Barcelona, and Brazilian team Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, which his former Suns teammate Leandro Barbosa supports. When Barbosa visited Corinthians in 2007, the club gave him a shirt with Nash&#x27;s name and jersey number.

Nash also co-hosted Showdown in Chinatown in 2008, an 8-on-8 charity soccer game held at Sara D. Roosevelt Park. He scored two goals in his team&#x27;s 8–5 victory. Participants included Thierry Henry, Jason Kidd, Baron Davis and Suns teammates Raja Bell and Leandro Barbosa.

In July 2013, Nash participated in a training session with the Italian soccer club Inter Milan at the New York Red Bulls&#x27; facilities in New Jersey. He also trained with the New York Cosmos B of the American fourth-division National Premier Soccer League in 2015.

In 2023, Nash took part in The Soccer Tournament as a guest of Como.

===Other interests===

Nash and a Montreal-based partner, Leonard Schlemm, opened the first Steve Nash Sports Club in the spring of 2007 in downtown Vancouver, a high-end, $5 million, facility that will mirror Nash&#x27;s own fitness philosophy.

In 2007, Nash wrote and produced an 81-second commercial for Nike titled &quot;Training Day&quot;, directed by Julian Schnabel&#x27;s daughter Lola, which gained popularity as a viral video on YouTube. Nash also started a film production company together with his cousin, filmmaker Ezra Holland, and intends to produce independent films. The first creative effort to come from Meathawk was a 91-second commercial, titled &quot;The Sixty Million Dollar Man&quot;, for Nike&#x27;s eco-friendly Trash Talk shoe, the first high-performance shoe to be made—at the behest of the environmentally conscious Nash—from recycled materials. Nash has worn the shoe since February 2008, but Nike produced only 5,000 pairs for sale. The ad, which broke virally on Earth Day 2008, was written by Nash and the directors of the spot, Danny Vaia and Ezra Holland. It is a spoof remake of the title sequence of the American television series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and plays on Nash&#x27;s numerous on-court collisions. Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire and Raja Bell have cameo appearances. Nash and Holland also co-directed the documentary &quot;Into the Wind&quot;, about iconic Canadian athlete and activist Terry Fox, as part of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; series. In October 2013, Nash appeared in the music video for &quot;City of Angels&quot; by Thirty Seconds to Mars. In 2013, Nash was one of the recipients of the Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards presented by &quot;Canadian Immigrant&quot; magazine.

At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Nash became the first NBA player in Olympic history to carry the torch and light the Olympic cauldron.

Nash is also known for his outspoken political views. He was an early and public opponent of the 2003 Iraq War, wearing a custom-made T-shirt to the 2003 NBA All Star Game that stated: &quot;No war – Shoot for peace.&quot; Although Nash did get positive support from teammate Nick Van Exel among others, he also drew criticism from David Robinson, a former Naval officer and fellow NBA player as well as commentators like Skip Bayless who criticized Nash as being uninformed and advised him to &quot;just shut up and play.&quot; Nash has also been critical of Arizona&#x27;s SB1070, legislation which seeks to aggressively address illegal immigration, as he felt &quot;the law obviously can target opportunities for racial profiling.&quot; In August 2017, Nash was critical of President Donald Trump in the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally, saying that &quot;to defend white supremacists and then slang his shitty ass grape juice pretty much sums the man up,&quot; referring to a winery Donald Trump has in Charlottesville, Virginia.

<text>In mathematical analysis, an improper integral is an extension of the notion of a definite integral to cases that violate the usual assumptions for that kind of integral. In the context of Riemann integrals (or, equivalently, Darboux integrals), this typically involves unboundedness, either of the set over which the integral is taken or of the integrand (the function being integrated), or both. It may also involve bounded but not closed sets or bounded but not continuous functions. While an improper integral is typically written symbolically just like a standard definite integral, it actually represents a limit of a definite integral or a sum of such limits; thus improper integrals are said to converge or diverge. If a regular definite integral (which may retronymically be called a proper integral) is worked out as if it is improper, the same answer will result.

In the simplest case of a real-valued function of a single variable integrated in the sense of Riemann (or Darboux) over a single interval, improper integrals may be in any of the following forms:
# formula_1
# formula_2
# formula_3
# formula_4, where formula_5 is undefined or discontinuous somewhere on formula_6

The first three forms are improper because the integrals are taken over an unbounded interval. (They may be improper for other reasons, as well, as explained below.) Such an integral is sometimes described as being of the &quot;first&quot; type or kind if the integrand otherwise satisfies the assumptions of integration. Integrals in the fourth form that are improper because formula_5 has a vertical asymptote somewhere on the interval formula_6 may be described as being of the &quot;second&quot; type or kind. Integrals that combine aspects of both types are sometimes described as being of the &quot;third&quot; type or kind.

In each case above, the improper integral must be rewritten using one or more limits, depending on what is causing the integral to be improper. For example, in case 1, if formula_5 is continuous on the entire interval formula_10, then
: formula_11
The limit on the right is taken to be the definition of the integral notation on the left.

If formula_5 is only continuous on formula_13 and not at formula_14 itself, then typically this is rewritten as
: formula_15
for any choice of formula_16. Here both limits must converge to a finite value for the improper integral to be said to converge. This requirement avoids the ambiguous case of adding positive and negative infinities (i.e., the &quot;formula_17&quot; indeterminate form). Alternatively, an iterated limit could be used or a single limit based on the Cauchy principal value.

If formula_5 is continuous on formula_19 and formula_20, with a discontinuity of any kind at formula_21, then
: formula_22
for any choice of formula_23. The previous remarks about indeterminate forms, iterated limits, and the Cauchy principal value also apply here.

The function formula_5 can have more discontinuities, in which case even more limits would be required (or a more complicated principal value expression).

Cases 2–4 are handled similarly. See the examples below.

Improper integrals can also be evaluated in the context of complex numbers, in higher dimensions, and in other theoretical frameworks such as Lebesgue integration or Henstock–Kurzweil integration. Integrals that are considered improper in one framework may not be in others.

==Examples==
The original definition of the Riemann integral does not apply to a function such as formula_25 on the interval , because in this case the domain of integration is unbounded. However, the Riemann integral can often be extended by continuity, by defining the improper integral instead as a limit

:formula_26

The narrow definition of the Riemann integral also does not cover the function formula_27 on the interval . The problem here is that the integrand is unbounded in the domain of integration. In other words, &quot;the definition of the Riemann integral requires that both the domain of integration and the integrand be bounded&quot;. However, the improper integral does exist if understood as the limit

:formula_28

Sometimes integrals may have two singularities where they are improper. Consider, for example, the function integrated from 0 to (shown right). At the lower bound of the integration domain, as goes to 0 the function goes to , and the upper bound is itself , though the function goes to 0. Thus this is a doubly improper integral. Integrated, say, from 1 to 3, an ordinary Riemann sum suffices to produce a result of /6. To integrate from 1 to , a Riemann sum is not possible. However, any finite upper bound, say (with ), gives a well-defined result, . This has a finite limit as goes to infinity, namely /2. Similarly, the integral from 1/3 to 1 allows a Riemann sum as well, coincidentally again producing /6. Replacing 1/3 by an arbitrary positive value (with ) is equally safe, giving . This, too, has a finite limit as goes to zero, namely /2. Combining the limits of the two fragments, the result of this improper integral is
:formula_29
This process does not guarantee success; a limit might fail to exist, or might be infinite. For example, over the bounded interval from 0 to 1 the integral of does not converge; and over the unbounded interval from 1 to the integral of does not converge.
It might also happen that an integrand is unbounded near an interior point, in which case the integral must be split at that point. For the integral as a whole to converge, the limit integrals on both sides must exist and must be bounded. For example:
:formula_30
But the similar integral
:formula_31
cannot be assigned a value in this way, as the integrals above and below zero in the integral domain do not independently converge. (However, see Cauchy principal value.)

== Convergence of the integral ==
An improper integral converges if the limit defining it exists. Thus for example one says that the improper integral
:formula_32
exists and is equal to &quot;L&quot; if the integrals under the limit exist for all sufficiently large &quot;t&quot;, and the value of the limit is equal to &quot;L&quot;.

It is also possible for an improper integral to diverge to infinity. In that case, one may assign the value of ∞ (or −∞) to the integral. For instance 
:formula_33
However, other improper integrals may simply diverge in no particular direction, such as
:formula_34
which does not exist, even as an extended real number. This is called divergence by oscillation.

A limitation of the technique of improper integration is that the limit must be taken with respect to one endpoint at a time. Thus, for instance, an improper integral of the form

:formula_35

can be defined by taking two separate limits; to which

:formula_36

provided the double limit is finite. It can also be defined as a pair of distinct improper integrals of the first kind:

:formula_37

where &quot;c&quot; is any convenient point at which to start the integration. This definition also applies when one of these integrals is infinite, or both if they have the same sign.

An example of an improper integral where both endpoints are infinite is the Gaussian integral An example which evaluates to infinity is But one cannot even define other integrals of this kind unambiguously, such as since the double limit is infinite and the two-integral method

:formula_38
yields an indeterminate form, In this case, one can however define an improper integral in the sense of Cauchy principal value:

:formula_39

The questions one must address in determining an improper integral are:

*Does the limit exist?
*Can the limit be computed?

The first question is an issue of mathematical analysis. The second one can be addressed by calculus techniques, but also in some cases by contour integration, Fourier transforms and other more advanced methods.

==Types of integrals==
There is more than one theory of integration. From the point of view of calculus, the Riemann integral theory is usually assumed as the default theory. In using improper integrals, it can matter which integration theory is in play.

* For the Riemann integral (or the Darboux integral, which is equivalent to it), improper integration is necessary &quot;both&quot; for unbounded intervals (since one cannot divide the interval into finitely many subintervals of finite length) &quot;and&quot; for unbounded functions with finite integral (since, supposing it is unbounded above, then the upper integral will be infinite, but the lower integral will be finite).
* The Lebesgue integral deals differently with unbounded domains and unbounded functions, so that often an integral which only exists as an improper Riemann integral will exist as a (proper) Lebesgue integral, such as formula_40. On the other hand, there are also integrals that have an improper Riemann integral but do not have a (proper) Lebesgue integral, such as formula_41. The Lebesgue theory does not see this as a deficiency: from the point of view of measure theory, formula_42 and cannot be defined satisfactorily. In some situations, however, it may be convenient to employ improper Lebesgue integrals as is the case, for instance, when defining the Cauchy principal value. The Lebesgue integral is more or less essential in the theoretical treatment of the Fourier transform, with pervasive use of integrals over the whole real line.
* For the Henstock–Kurzweil integral, improper integration &quot;is not necessary&quot;, and this is seen as a strength of the theory: it encompasses all Lebesgue integrable and improper Riemann integrable functions.

== Improper Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals ==

In some cases, the integral

:formula_43

can be defined as an integral (a Lebesgue integral, for instance) without reference to the limit

:formula_44

but cannot otherwise be conveniently computed. This often happens when the function &quot;f&quot; being integrated from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;c&quot; has a vertical asymptote at &quot;c&quot;, or if &quot;c&quot; = ∞ (see Figures 1 and 2). In such cases, the improper Riemann integral allows one to calculate the Lebesgue integral of the function. Specifically, the following theorem holds :

* If a function &quot;f&quot; is Riemann integrable on [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] for every &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;a&quot;, and the partial integrals
::formula_45
:are bounded as &quot;b&quot; → ∞, then the improper Riemann integrals
::formula_46
:both exist. Furthermore, &quot;f&quot; is Lebesgue integrable on [&quot;a&quot;, ∞), and its Lebesgue integral is equal to its improper Riemann integral.

For example, the integral
:formula_47
can be interpreted alternatively as the improper integral
:formula_48
or it may be interpreted instead as a Lebesgue integral over the set (0, ∞). Since both of these kinds of integral agree, one is free to choose the first method to calculate the value of the integral, even if one ultimately wishes to regard it as a Lebesgue integral. Thus improper integrals are clearly useful tools for obtaining the actual values of integrals.

In other cases, however, a Lebesgue integral between finite endpoints may not even be defined, because the integrals of the positive and negative parts of &quot;f&quot; are both infinite, but the improper Riemann integral may still exist. Such cases are &quot;properly improper&quot; integrals, i.e. their values cannot be defined except as such limits. For example,

:formula_49

cannot be interpreted as a Lebesgue integral, since

:formula_50

But formula_51 is nevertheless integrable between any two finite endpoints, and its integral between 0 and ∞ is usually understood as the limit of the integral:

:formula_52

==Singularities==
One can speak of the &quot;singularities&quot; of an improper integral, meaning those points of the extended real number line at which limits are used.

==Cauchy principal value==

Consider the difference in values of two limits:

:formula_53

:formula_54

The former is the Cauchy principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression

:formula_55

Similarly, we have

:formula_56

but

:formula_57

The former is the principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression

:formula_58

All of the above limits are cases of the indeterminate form formula_59.

These pathologies do not affect &quot;Lebesgue-integrable&quot; functions, that is, functions the integrals of whose absolute values are finite.

==Summability==
An improper integral may diverge in the sense that the limit defining it may not exist. In this case, there are more sophisticated definitions of the limit which can produce a convergent value for the improper integral. These are called summability methods.

One summability method, popular in Fourier analysis, is that of Cesàro summation. The integral

:formula_60

is Cesàro summable (C, α) if

:formula_61

exists and is finite . The value of this limit, should it exist, is the (C, α) sum of the integral.

An integral is (C, 0) summable precisely when it exists as an improper integral. However, there are integrals which are (C, α) summable for α &gt; 0 which fail to converge as improper integrals (in the sense of Riemann or Lebesgue). One example is the integral

:formula_62

which fails to exist as an improper integral, but is (C,&quot;α&quot;) summable for every &quot;α&quot; &gt; 0. This is an integral version of Grandi&#x27;s series.

==Multivariable improper integrals==
The improper integral can also be defined for functions of several variables. The definition is slightly different, depending on whether one requires integrating over an unbounded domain, such as formula_63, or is integrating a function with singularities, like formula_64.

===Improper integrals over arbitrary domains===
If formula_65 is a non-negative function that is Riemann integrable over every compact cube of the form formula_66, for formula_67, then the improper integral of &quot;f&quot; over formula_68 is defined to be the limit
:formula_69
provided it exists.

A function on an arbitrary domain &quot;A&quot; in formula_70 is extended to a function formula_71 on formula_68 by zero outside of &quot;A&quot;:
:formula_73
The Riemann integral of a function over a bounded domain &quot;A&quot; is then defined as the integral of the extended function formula_71 over a cube formula_66 containing &quot;A&quot;: 
:formula_76
More generally, if &quot;A&quot; is unbounded, then the improper Riemann integral over an arbitrary domain in formula_70 is defined as the limit:
:formula_78

===Improper integrals with singularities===
If &quot;f&quot; is a non-negative function which is unbounded in a domain &quot;A&quot;, then the improper integral of &quot;f&quot; is defined by truncating &quot;f&quot; at some cutoff &quot;M&quot;, integrating the resulting function, and then taking the limit as &quot;M&quot; tends to infinity. That is for formula_79, set formula_80. Then define
:formula_81
provided this limit exists.

===Functions with both positive and negative values===
These definitions apply for functions that are non-negative. A more general function &quot;f&quot; can be decomposed as a difference of its positive part formula_82 and negative part formula_83, so
:formula_84
with formula_85 and formula_86 both non-negative functions. The function &quot;f&quot; has an improper Riemann integral if each of formula_85 and formula_86 has one, in which case the value of that improper integral is defined by
:formula_89
In order to exist in this sense, the improper integral necessarily converges absolutely, since
:formula_90

<text>Cholinergic agents are compounds which mimic the action of acetylcholine and/or butyrylcholine. In general, the word &quot;choline&quot; describes the various quaternary ammonium salts containing the &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-trimethylethanolammonium cation. Found in most animal tissues, choline is a primary component of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and functions with inositol as a basic constituent of lecithin. Choline also prevents fat deposits in the liver and facilitates the movement of fats into cells. 

The parasympathetic nervous system, which uses acetylcholine almost exclusively to send its messages, is said to be almost entirely cholinergic. Neuromuscular junctions, preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, the basal forebrain, and brain stem complexes are also cholinergic, as are the receptor for the merocrine sweat glands.

In neuroscience and related fields, the term cholinergic is used in these related contexts:
* A substance (or ligand) is cholinergic if it is capable of producing, altering, or releasing acetylcholine, or butyrylcholine (&quot;indirect-acting&quot;), or mimicking their behaviours at one or more of the body&#x27;s acetylcholine receptor (&quot;direct-acting&quot;) or butyrylcholine receptor types (&quot;direct-acting&quot;). Such mimics are called parasympathomimetic drugs or cholinomimetic drugs.
* A receptor is cholinergic if it uses acetylcholine as its neurotransmitter.
* A synapse is cholinergic if it uses acetylcholine as its neurotransmitter.

== Cholinergic drug ==
=== Structure activity relationship for cholinergic drugs ===
# A molecule must possess a nitrogen atom capable of bearing a positive charge, preferably a quaternary ammonium salt.
# For maximum potency, the size of the alkyl groups substituted on the nitrogen should not exceed the size of a methyl group.
# The molecule should have an oxygen atom, preferably an ester-like oxygen capable of participating in a hydrogen bond.
# A two-carbon unit should occur between the oxygen atom and the nitrogen atom.
# There must be two methyl groups on the nitrogen
#A larger third alkyl group is tolerated but more than one large alkyl groups leads to loss of activity
#The overall size of the molecule cannot be altered much. Bigger molecules have poorer activity
== Cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ==

The hypothesis states that a possible cause of AD is the reduced synthesis of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in both memory and learning, two important components of AD. Many current drug therapies for AD are centered on the cholinergic hypothesis, although not all have been effective. Studies performed in the 1980s demonstrated significant impairment of cholinergic markers in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients.

Thus it was proposed that degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and the associated loss of cholinergic neurotransmission in the cerebral cortex and other areas contributed significantly to the deterioration in cognitive function seen in patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease

Further studies on the cholinergic system and AD demonstrated acetylcholine plays a role in learning and memory. Scopolamine, an anticholinergic drug, was used to block cholinergic activity in young adults and induce memory impairments similar to those present in the elderly. The memory impairments were reversed when treated with physostigmine, a cholinergic agonist. However, reversing memory impairments in AD patients may not be this easy due to permanent changes in brain structure.

When young adults perform memory and attention tasks, brain activation patterns are balanced between the frontal and occipital lobes, creating a balance between bottom-up and top-down processing. Normal cognitive aging may affect long term and working memory, though the cholinergic system and cortical areas maintain performance through functional compensation. Adults with AD presenting with dysfunction of the cholinergic system are not able to compensate for long-term and working memory deficits.

AD is currently treated by increasing acetylcholine concentration by using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to inhibit acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine. Current acetylcholinesterase inhibitors approved in the United States by the FDA to treat Alzheimer&#x27;s include donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. These drugs work to increase the levels of acetylcholine and subsequently increase the function of neural cells. However, not all treatments based upon the cholinergic hypothesis have been successful in treating the symptoms or slowing the progression of AD. Therefore, a disruption to the cholinergic system has been proposed as a consequence of AD rather than a direct cause.

<doc id="346036" wikidata="Q2713856" url="?curid=346036" title="Family Radio Service">
<text>The Family Radio Service (FRS) is an improved walkie-talkie radio system authorized in the United States since 1996. This personal radio service uses channelized frequencies around 462 and 467 MHz in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band. It does not suffer the interference effects found on citizens&#x27; band (CB) at 27 MHz, or the 49 MHz band also used by cordless telephones, toys, and baby monitors. FRS uses frequency modulation (FM) instead of amplitude modulation (AM). Since the UHF band has different radio propagation characteristics, short-range use of FRS may be more predictable than the more powerful license-free radios operating in the HF CB band.

Initially proposed by RadioShack in 1994 for use by families, FRS has also seen significant adoption by business interests, as an unlicensed, low-cost alternative to the business band. New rules issued by the FCC in May 2017 clarify and simplify the overlap between FRS and General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) radio services.

Worldwide, a number of similar personal radio services exist; these share the characteristics of low power operation in the UHF (or upper VHF) band using FM, and simplified or no end-user licenses. Exact frequency allocations differ, so equipment legal to operate in one country may cause unacceptable interference in another. Radios approved for FRS are not legal to operate anywhere in Europe.

== Technical information ==
FRS radios use narrow-band frequency modulation (NBFM) with a maximum deviation of 2.5 kilohertz. The channels are spaced at 12.5 kilohertz intervals.

All 22 channels are shared with GMRS radios. Initially, the FRS radios were limited to 500 milliwatts across all channels. However, after May 18, 2017, the limit is increased to 2 watts on channels 1-7 and 15–22.

FRS radios frequently have provisions for using sub-audible tone squelch (CTCSS and DCS) codes, filtering out unwanted chatter from other users on the same frequency. Although these codes are sometimes called &quot;privacy codes&quot; or &quot;private line codes&quot; (PL codes), they offer no protection from eavesdropping and are intended only to help reduce unwanted audio when sharing busy channels. Tone codes also do nothing to prevent desired transmissions from being swamped by stronger signals having a different code.

All equipment used on FRS must be certified according to FCC regulations. Radios are not certified for use in this service if they exceed limits on power output, have a detachable antenna, allow for unauthorized selection of transmitting frequencies outside of the 22 frequencies designated for FRS, or for other reasons. After December 2017, the FCC no longer accepts applications to certify hand-held FRS units providing for transmission in any other radio band.

FRS radios must use only permanently attached antennas; there are also table-top FRS &quot;base station&quot; radios that have whip antennas. This limitation intentionally restricts the range of communications, allowing greatest use of the available channels by the community. The use of duplex radio repeaters and interconnects to the telephone network are prohibited under FRS rules.

The range advertised on specific devices might not apply in real-world situations, since large buildings, trees, etc., can interfere with the signal and reduce range. Under exceptional conditions, (such as hilltop to hilltop, or over open water) communication is possible at or more, but that is rare. Under normal conditions, with line of sight blocked by a few buildings or trees, FRS has an actual range of about 0.5 to 1.5 km (0.3 to 1 mile).

== FRS/GMRS hybrid radios ==
In May 2017, the FCC significantly revised the rules for combination FRS/GMRS radios. Combination radios will be permitted to radiate up to 2 watts on 15 of the 22 channels (as opposed to 0.5 watts), and all FRS channels are now considered shared with the GMRS service. Operation over 2 watts, or operation on GMRS repeater input channels, will still require GMRS licensing. The FCC will not certify combination FRS/GMRS radios that exceed the current power limits for the FRS service.

Hybrid FRS/GMRS consumer radios have been introduced that have 22 channels. Before May 2017, radios had been certified for unlicensed operation on the 7 FRS frequencies, channels 8–14, under FRS rules.

Prior to the 2017 revision, FCC rules required a GMRS license to operate on channels 1–7 using more than 0.5 watts. Many hybrid radios have an ERP that is lower than 0.5 watts on channels 1–7, or can be set by the user to operate at low power on these channels. This allows hybrid radios to be used under the license-free FRS rules if the ERP is less than 0.5 watts and the unit is certified for FRS operation on these frequencies. Beginning September 28, 2017, FRS operation is permitted at up to 2 watts on these channels.

Interference to licensed services may be investigated by the FCC.

Channels 8–14, formerly exclusive to FRS, since 28 September 2017 can be used by GMRS at 0.5 watts. Channels 15–22, formerly reserved exclusively for GMRS, can be used at up to 2 watts in the FRS.

Effective September 30, 2019, it became unlawful in the US to import, manufacture, sell or offer to sell radio equipment capable of operating under both GMRS and FRS. This does not include amateur and other radio equipment that are not certified under Part 95, such as many handheld radios that are marketed for amateur use but are also able to transmit on FRS and GMRS frequencies.

== List of FRS channels compared to GMRS==
* GMRS has other exclusive channels for repeater input
* No FRS unit shall exceed 0.5 watt ERP (Effective Radiated Power) on channels 8-14. FRS Channels 15-22 are shared with GMRS also under 2 watt ERP limit. However, if the device includes any of the following channels (467.5500, 467.5750, 467.6000, 467.6250, 467.6500, 467.6750, 467.7000, and 467.7250 MHz) a GMRS license is required. Benefits of a GMRS license include the ability to use repeaters, run higher power (up to 50 watts), and utilize external antennas, which result in much greater communication distances.

== FRS radios in other countries ==
Personal UHF radio services similar to the American FRS exist in other countries, although since technical standards and frequency bands will differ, usually FCC-approved FRS equipment may not be used in other jurisdictions.

=== Canada ===
American-standard FRS radios have been approved for use in Canada since April 2000. only low-power (2 W ERP), half duplex GMRS operation is permitted, but a license is not required. Repeater and high-power operations are not permitted. This allows the use of dual-mode FRS/GMRS walkie-talkies, but precludes the use of higher-powered GMRS devices designed for vehicle and base-station purposes..

=== Mexico ===
Since tourists often bring their FRS radios with them, and since trade between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico is of great value to all three countries, the Mexican Secretary of Communication and Transportation has authorized use of the FRS frequencies and equipment similar to that in the US. However, dual-mode FRS/GMRS equipment is not approved in Mexico, so caution should be exercised in operating hybrid FRS/GMRS devices purchased elsewhere.

=== South America ===
Dual-mode GMRS/FRS equipment is also approved in Brazil (GMRS only in simplex mode, GMRS frequencies 462.550, 467.550, 462.725, 467.725 are not allowed) and most other South American countries. Portable radios are heavily used in private communications, mainly by security staff in nightclubs and malls, but also in private parking, maintenance, and delivery services.

<doc id="346051" wikidata="Q1079231" url="?curid=346051" title="Christian Cullen">
<text>Christian Mathias Cullen (born 12 February 1976) is a retired New Zealand rugby union player. He played most of his rugby at fullback for New Zealand (the All Blacks), for the Hurricanes in the Super 12, and for Manawatu, Wellington and later Munster at provincial level. He was nicknamed the &quot;Paekakariki Express&quot; and was considered to be one of the most potent running fullbacks rugby has ever seen. With 46 tries scored in 58 tests, Cullen is the 9th-highest try-scorer in international rugby.

==Youth and early career==

Cullen was born in Paraparaumu and grew up in Paekākāriki, a small town north of Wellington. He is the youngest of three children. He has an elder twin brother named Shane and a sister named Anita. Cullen is of Irish descent; he also has Samoan and German ancestry.

His rugby talent emerged in his high school years and he was selected in the New Zealand secondary schools team in 1993 and 1994. He played senior rugby for Manawatu in 1995 and scored 70 points through 12 tries, two conversions and two penalty goals. He was selected to the New Zealand sevens squad for tournaments in Fiji and Hong Kong.

== Professional career ==
Cullen&#x27;s provincial career started in 1994 season for Horowhenua-Kapiti. In 1996 he played in the first-ever Super 12 game, contested by the Hurricanes and the Blues. That year he scored seven tries in nine matches.

At the 1996 World Sevens competition in Hong Kong he scored 18 tries, including seven in one match. Later that year he was selected as an All Black. He scored seven tries in his first two Test matches: a hat-trick on debut against Samoa and four tries against Scotland. He sustained a knee cartilage injury on the All Blacks&#x27; tour to South Africa.

In 1997 Cullen returned from injury and scored 11 tries in 10 games for the Hurricanes, and 12 tries in 12 Test matches for the All Blacks.

The All Blacks had a poor year in 1998 with five consecutive losses, but Cullen scored four tries in seven matches. He represented New Zealand in rugby sevens at the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games, playing seven games, scoring nine tries and kicking 23 conversions. New Zealand won the tournament and the gold medal.

In 1999 Cullen was a member of New Zealand&#x27;s unsuccessful Rugby World Cup squad. He played six matches in the Cup tournament, starting five at centre which was not his preferred position. In 2000 he scored 10 tries in 11 games for the Hurricanes and seven tries in four Tri Nations Tests, including three consecutive pairs.

In 2001 Cullen sustained a severe knee injury that required surgery and an intensive recovery programme. He made himself unavailable for the All Blacks&#x27; 2001 end-of-year tour, but was announced &#x27;dropped&#x27; by coach John Mitchell at a NZRU press conference. Cullen and Mitchell&#x27;s personal differences went unresolved over time. Cullen was selected to and dropped from the All Blacks squad throughout 2002. He scored four tries in the five Test matches that year.

In the 2003 Super season Cullen scored eight tries in 12 games for the Hurricanes, taking his Super Rugby career tally to 56, a record at the time. He was briefly and controversially selected for the Māori rugby team, despite having, according to his father, about 1/64th Māori ancestry. He was left out of New Zealand&#x27;s 2003 World Cup squad. He played out the NPC season for Wellington and received a standing ovation after the Championship final, despite Wellington&#x27;s losing to Auckland.

== Later career and retirement ==

At the end of 2003 Cullen moved to Ireland, after he was dropped by John Mitchell, where he played for Munster. His time with Munster was blighted by injuries, particularly to his shoulder, limiting his appearances. His last match for Munster was a 15–7 Celtic League win over the Newport Gwent Dragons at Musgrave Park on 28 April 2007. Two weeks later, on 12 May, he announced his retirement from rugby and stated his intention of returning to New Zealand to start a business.

==Records==
Cullen is the All Blacks&#x27; second-highest try-scorer in the Tri Nations Series with 16, second only to Richie McCaw. He was the first player to score a try in every Tri Nations test in one season. He is New Zealand&#x27;s second most-capped test fullback. At the time of his retirement he was the All Blacks&#x27; leading try-scorer with 46; that record has since been overtaken by Doug Howlett. He scored over 150 tries while playing in New Zealand. He is the third-highest try-scorer in Super Rugby with 56 tries, behind Joe Roff and Howlett.

==Biography==

His biography, &quot;Christian Cullen: Life on the Run&quot; (by John Matheson) was released in October 2003. The book received attention particularly for Cullen&#x27;s criticism of John Mitchell.

<text>The Oregonian is a daily newspaper based in Portland, Oregon, United States, owned by Advance Publications. It is the oldest continuously published newspaper on the U.S. West Coast, founded as a weekly by Thomas J. Dryer on December 4, 1850, and published daily since 1861. It is the largest newspaper in Oregon and the second largest in the Pacific Northwest by circulation. It is one of the few newspapers with a statewide focus in the United States. The Sunday edition is published under the title The Sunday Oregonian. The regular edition was published under the title The Morning Oregonian from 1861 until 1937.

&quot;The Oregonian&quot; received the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, the only gold medal annually awarded by the organization. The paper&#x27;s staff or individual writers have received seven other Pulitzer Prizes, most recently the award for Editorial Writing in 2014.

In late 2013, home delivery has been reduced to Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday while retaining print copies daily through news stands/newsracks. In January 2024, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday print edition were discontinued. 

==History==

===Establishment===
One year prior to the incorporation of the tiny town of Portland, Oregon, in 1851, prospective leaders of the new community determined to establish a local newspaper—an institution which was seen as a prerequisite for urban growth. Chief among these pioneer community organizers seeking establishment of a Portland press were Col. W.W. Chapman and prominent local businessman Henry W. Corbett. In the fall of 1850, Chapman and Corbett traveled to San Francisco, at the time far and away the largest city on the west coast of the United States, in search of an editor interested in and capable of producing a weekly newspaper in Portland. There the pair met Thomas J. Dryer, a transplanted New Yorker who was an energetic writer with both printing equipment and previous experience in the production of a small circulation community newspaper in his native Ulster County, New York.

====First weekly issues====

Dryer&#x27;s press was transported to Portland and it was there on December 4, 1850, that the first issue of &quot;The Weekly Oregonian&quot; found its readers. Each weekly issue consisted of four pages, printed six columns wide. Little attention was paid to current news events, with the bulk of the paper&#x27;s content devoted to political themes and biographical commentary. The paper took a staunch political line supportive of the Whig Party—an orientation which soon brought it into conflict with &quot;The Statesman,&quot; a Democratic paper launched at Oregon City not long after &quot;The Weekly Oregonian&quot; debut. A loud and bitter rivalry between the competing news organs ensued.

===1860s–1870s===

====Pittock era====
Henry Pittock became the owner in 1861 as compensation for unpaid wages, and he began publishing the paper daily, except Sundays. Pittock&#x27;s goal was to focus more on news than the bully pulpit established by Dryer. He ordered a new press in December 1860 and also arranged for the news to be sent by telegraph to Redding, California, then by stagecoach to Jacksonville, Oregon, and then by pony express to Portland.

====Scott era====
From 1866 to 1872 Harvey W. Scott was the editor. Henry W. Corbett bought the paper from a cash-poor Pittock in October 1872 and placed William Lair Hill as editor. Scott, fired by Corbett for supporting Ben Holladay&#x27;s candidates, became editor of Holladay&#x27;s rival &quot;Portland Daily Bulletin&quot;. The paper went out of print in 1876, Holladay having lost $200,000 in the process. Corbett sold &quot;The Oregonian&quot; back to Pittock in 1877, marking a return of Scott to the paper&#x27;s editorial helm. A part-owner of the paper, Scott would remain as editor-in-chief until shortly before his death in 1910.

===1880s–1890s===
One of the journalists who began his career on &quot;The Oregonian&quot; during this time period was James J. Montague who took over and wrote the column &quot;Slings &amp; Arrows&quot; until he was hired away by William Randolph Hearst in 1902. In this time period Governor Sylvester Pennoyer prominently criticized the &quot;Oregonian&quot; for calling for vigilante &quot;justice&quot; against Chinese Americans (Pennoyer favored running people of Chinese descent out of the state by &quot;legal&quot; means). The &quot;West Shore&quot; criticized the &quot;Oregonian&quot; for its sensationalized coverage of the English monarchy.

====&quot;Sunday Oregonian&quot;====
In 1881, the first &quot;Sunday Oregonian&quot; was published. The paper became known as the voice of business-oriented Republicans, as evidenced by consistent endorsement of Republican candidates for president in every federal election before 1992.

====New location====

The paper&#x27;s offices and presses were originally housed in a two-story building at the intersection of First Street (now First Avenue) and Morrison Street, but in 1892 the paper moved into a new nine-story building at 6th and Alder streets. The new building was, the same as its predecessor (and successor), called the Oregonian Building. It included a clock tower at one corner, and the building&#x27;s overall height of 194 to 196 feet (around 59 m) made it the tallest structure in Portland, a distinction it retained until the completion of the Yeon Building in 1911. It contained about of floor space, including the basement but not the tower. The newspaper did not move again until 1948. The 1892 building was demolished in 1950.

===1900s–1940s===


Following the death of Harvey Scott in 1910, the paper&#x27;s editor-in-chief was Edgar B. Piper, who had previously been managing editor. Piper remained editor until his death in 1928.

The Oregonian&#x27;s first female journalist, Louise Bryant, joined the paper around 1909.

====The &quot;Morning Oregonian&quot; and KGW====
In 1922, the &quot;Oregonian&quot; discontinued its weekly edition, and launched KGW, Oregon&#x27;s first commercial radio station. Five years later, KGW affiliated with NBC (1927). The newspaper purchased a second station, KEX, in 1933, from NBC subsidiary Northwest Broadcasting Co. In 1944, KEX was sold to Westinghouse Radio Stations, Inc. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; launched KGW-FM, the Northwest&#x27;s first FM station, in 1946 (acclaimed by &quot;The Oregonian&quot; May 8, 1946), known today as KKRZ. KGW and KGW-FM were sold to King Broadcasting Co in 1953.

In 1937, &quot;The Morning Oregonian&quot; shortened its name to &quot;The Oregonian&quot;. Two years later, associate editor Ronald G. Callvert received a Pulitzer Prize for editorial reporting for &quot;distinguished editorial writing...as exemplified by the editorial entitled &quot;&quot;.

A 20-year trust under which the &quot;Oregonian&quot; was conducted expired in 1939. O. L. Price, who managed the newspaper under the trust, retired at age 61 upon its expiration. Ownership reverted to the heirs of Pittock and H. W. Scott.

====Move in 1948====
In 1948, the paper moved to a new location within downtown, where its headquarters ultimately would remain for the next 66 years, on SW Broadway between Jefferson Street and Columbia Street. The new building was designed by Pietro Belluschi and again was named the Oregonian Building. The block was previously home to the William S. Ladd mansion, which had been demolished around 1925. Circa 1946, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; purchased the block for $100,000, which led to complaints from paper editor Leslie M. Scott because of the outrageous price. Three years later, Scott purchased a nearby block for the state at $300,000 while holding the office of Oregon State Treasurer.

The new &quot;Oregonian&quot; building was to contain the KGW radio station and a television studio, as well as a large and opulent dining room. The contractor was L. H. Hoffman, who was under a very profitable cost-plus contract. Aside from the &quot;extravagance of design&quot;, construction materials were in short supply, the nation was under heavy inflation, and Belluschi&#x27;s plans were never ready, leading to massive costs. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; had to borrow from banks, the first time in over 50 years. New company president E. B. MacNaughton was forced to exhaust the company&#x27;s loan limits at First National Bank, then turn to the Bank of America. MacNaughton then eliminated an extra elevator, the dining room, and KGW&#x27;s radio and television studios. The building still cost $4 million, twice the original estimate.

The building opened in 1948, but &quot;The Oregonian&quot; had to sell it to Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company for $3.6 million in a leaseback arrangement. Further financial issues led to the 1950 sale to Samuel Newhouse.

===1950s–1960s===

In 1950, Advance Publications founder S. I. &quot;Si&quot; Newhouse purchased the paper. At that time, the sale price of $5.6 million was the largest for a single newspaper. The sale was announced on December 11, 1950. In 1954, Newhouse bought 50% of Mount Hood Radio &amp; Television Broadcasting Corp, which broadcasts KOIN-TV, Portland&#x27;s first VHF television station, KOIN AM (now KUFO), and KOIN-FM (now KXL-FM). &quot;The Oregonian&quot; circulation in 1950 was 214,916; that of the rival &quot;Oregon Journal&quot; was 190,844.

In 1957, staff writers William Lambert and Wallace Turner were awarded that year&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize for Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting - No Edition time. Their prize cited &quot;their expose of vice and corruption in Portland involving some municipal officials and officers of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Western Conference&quot; and noted that &quot;they fulfilled their assignments despite great handicaps and the risk of reprisal from lawless elements.&quot;

====The &quot;Oregon Journal&quot;====
What was to become a long and heated strike began against both &quot;The Oregonian&quot; and &quot;The Oregon Journal&quot; began in November 1959. The strike was called by Stereotypers Local 49 over various contract issues, particularly the introduction of more automated plate-casting machinery; the new-to-American-publishing German-made equipment required one operator instead of the four that operated the existing equipment. Wallace Turner and many other writers and photographers refused to cross the picket lines and never returned. The two newspapers published a &quot;joint, typo-marred paper&quot; for six months until they had hired enough nonunion help to resume separate operations. Starting in February 1960, striking union workers published a daily newspaper, &quot;The (Portland) Reporter&quot;; its circulation peaked at 78,000, but was shut down in October 1964.

In 1961, Newhouse bought &quot;The Oregon Journal&quot;, Portland&#x27;s afternoon daily newspaper. Production and business operations of the two newspapers were consolidated in &quot;The Oregonian&quot; building, while their editorial staffs remained separate. The National Labor Relations Board ruled the strike illegal in November 1963. Strikers continued to picket until April 4, 1965, at which point the two newspapers became open shops.

===Late 1960s–early 1980s===

In 1967, Fred Stickel came to &quot;The Oregonian&quot; from New Jersey to become general manager of the paper; he became president in 1972 and publisher in 1975.

As part of a larger corporate plan to exit broadcasting, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; sold KOIN-TV to newspaper owner Lee Enterprises in 1977. At the same time, KOIN-AM and -FM were sold to Gaylord Broadcasting Co. Since S. I. Newhouse died in 1979, S.I. Jr. has managed the magazines, and Donald oversees the newspapers.

&quot;The Oregonian&quot; lost its primary &quot;competitor&quot; and Portland became a one-daily-newspaper city in 1982, when Advance/Newhouse shut down the &quot;Journal&quot;, citing declining advertising revenues.

===1985===
The Oregonian published a twenty-part series on the Rajneeshpuram, a religious community that established itself in Antelope, Oregon.

===Late 1980s===

====Hilliard era====
William A. Hilliard was named editor in 1987, and was the paper&#x27;s first African-American editor. A resident of Oregon since the age of 8, Hilliard had already worked at &quot;The Oregonian&quot; for 35 years; he had been city editor starting in 1971 and executive editor since 1982.

====1989====
&quot;The Oregonian&quot; established an Asia bureau in Tokyo, Japan in 1989.

Also in 1989, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; endorsed a Democratic candidate for president for the first time in its history when it supported Bill Clinton in 1992.

===1990s===
The year 1993 was an eventful year for &quot;The Oregonian&quot;. Robert M. Landauer, then editorial page editor, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Editorial Writing for &quot;a bold campaign to defuse myths and prejudice promoted by an anti-homosexual constitutional amendment, which was subsequently defeated&quot;, according to the Pulitzer judges. The integrity of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; became the subject of national coverage when &quot;The Washington Post&quot; broke the story of inappropriate sexual advances which led to the resignation of Oregon senator Bob Packwood four years later. This prompted some to joke, &quot;If it matters to Oregonians, it&#x27;s in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;&quot; (a twist on the &quot;Oregonian&quot; slogan &quot;If it matters to Oregonians, it&#x27;s in &quot;The Oregonian&quot;). Finally, Newhouse appointed a new editor for the paper, Sandra Rowe, who relocated from &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot;.
====Rowe era====
Sandra Rowe joined the paper as executive editor in June 1993. She formally became editor in 1994 with the retirement of William Hilliard, but Hilliard had effectively already given her control of the editor&#x27;s reins in 1993 as he focused his attention on his duties as the newly elected president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors for 1993–94, in his final year before retirement.

According to &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot;, soon after Rowe&#x27;s arrival, she introduced organizational changes to the newsroom. Instead of having a large number of general assignment reporters, she organized them around teams, many of which often develop &quot;subject expertise&quot; that &quot;reflect[s] the interests of readers, not traditional newsroom boundaries.&quot; Examples (over the years) include &quot;Northwest Issues and Environment&quot;, &quot;Living In the &#x27;90s&quot;/&quot;How We Live&quot;, &quot;Politics and Accountability&quot;, &quot;Health, Science, and Medicine&quot;, &quot;Sustainability and Growth&quot;, and &quot;Higher Education&quot;. Accompanying the reorganization was a more bottom-up approach to identifying stories: &quot;instead of having an assignment-driven newspaper, you have the beat reporters coming to editors with what is going on&quot;, with the team editors responsible for deciding what stories were covered by their teams.

The position of public editor was established at &quot;The Oregonian&quot; in 1993, and Robert Caldwell was appointed. Michele McLellan assumed the role three years later, and was delegated the authority to decide whether or not a newspaper error should result in the publication of a correction.

===Pulitzer Prize===
Staff writer Richard Read won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, for a series, &quot;The French Fry Connection&quot;. The articles illustrated the impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis by following a case of french fries from a Washington-state farm to a McDonald&#x27;s in Singapore, ending in Indonesia during riots that led to the Fall of Suharto. The newsroom celebrated &quot;The Oregonian&quot; first Pulitzer in 42 years with champagne, McDonald&#x27;s french fries and a brass band. The series also received the Overseas Press Club award for best business reporting from abroad, the Scripps Howard Foundation award for business reporting and the Blethen award for enterprise reporting.

Co-worker Tom Hallman Jr. was a finalist for the 1999 Pulitzer Prize in Feature Writing, for his &quot;unique profile of a man struggling to recover from a brain injury&quot;. Reporter Mark O&#x27;Keefe won an Overseas Press Club award for human rights reporting. The editors of &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; recognized &quot;The Oregonian&quot; as number twelve on its list of &quot;America&#x27;s Best Newspapers&quot;, and the best newspaper owned by the Newhouse family.

===2000s===
In 2000, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for its coverage of an environmental disaster created when the &quot;New Carissa&quot;, a freighter that carried nearly 400,000 gallons of heavy fuel, ran aground February 4, 1999, north of Coos Bay, Oregon. The articles detailed &quot;how fumbling efforts of official agencies failed to contain the far-reaching damage&quot;, according to the Pulitzer jury. That same year reporters Brent Walth and Alex Pulaski were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Writing for their series on political influences in pesticide regulation.

====Pulitzer Prize for Public Service====
&quot;The Oregonian&quot; and news staff were acknowledged with two Pulitzer Prizes in 2001. The paper was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, for its &quot;detailed and unflinching examination of systematic problems within the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, including harsh treatment of foreign nationals and other widespread abuses, which prompted various reforms.&quot; The series was reported and written by Kim Christensen, Richard Read, Julie Sullivan-Springhetti and Brent Walth, with editorials by the editorial board.

Staff writer Tom Hallman Jr. received the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his series, &quot;The Boy Behind the Mask&quot;, on a teen with a facial deformity.

In 2003, music critic David Stabler was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Feature Writing for &quot;his sensitive, sometimes surprising chronicle of a teenage prodigy&#x27;s struggle with a musical talent that proved to be both a gift and a problem&quot;. Michael Arrieta-Walden became public editor in 2003; when he ended his three-year term in the position, no successor was named.

====2004 criticism====
In 2004 the paper faced criticism after a headline characterized a 1970s sexual relationship between then-mayor Neil Goldschmidt and a 14-year-old girl as an &quot;affair&quot;, rather than statutory rape.

The paper endorsed a Democrat for president for the second time in its 150-year history when it backed John Kerry for president in 2004.

====2005–2006====
In 2005, staff reporters Steve Suo and Erin Hoover Barnett were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for &quot;their groundbreaking reports on the failure to curtail the growing illicit use of methamphetamines&quot;. That same year, Americans United for Palestinian Human Rights published two reports on &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, claiming the paper under-reported Palestinian deaths in its news stories of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and excluded the Palestinian narrative in its Opinion Pages.

Editorial writers Doug Bates and Rick Attig were awarded the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for their editorials on the conditions at the Oregon State Hospital. As of late 2006 and early 2007, the paper&#x27;s circulation averaged 319,625 for the daily edition and 375,913 for the Sunday edition, giving &quot;The Oregonian&quot; the 22nd-largest circulation among all major newspapers in the U.S.

====2007====
In 2007, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; and its journalists were recognized with several awards. Sports columnist John Canzano was selected as the nation&#x27;s No. 2 sports columnist in the annual Associated Press Sports Editors Awards. Three &quot;Oregonian&quot; reporters—Jeff Kosseff, Bryan Denson, and Les Zaitz—were awarded the George Polk Award for national reporting, for their series about the failure of a decades-old, multibillion-dollar, federal program established by the Javits-Wagner-O&#x27;Day Act intended to help people with severe disabilities find employment. Instead it &quot;awarded executives handsomely but left disabled workers in segregated jobs often paying less than minimum wage.&quot;

On April 16, 2007, it was announced that the staff of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for their &quot;skillful and tenacious coverage of a family missing in the Oregon mountains, telling the tragic story both in print and online.&quot; In addition, the paper&#x27;s reporters were finalists in two other categories. Les Zaitz, Jeff Kosseff and Bryan Denson were finalists for the Pulitzer for National Reporting for the same series that also won the George Polk Award noted above. Inara Verzemnieks was nominated for the Pulitzer for Feature Writing for &quot;her witty and perceptive portfolio of features on an array of everyday topics&quot;, according to the Pulitzer judges.

====2008====

In February 2008, &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; named editor Sandra Mims Rowe and executive editor Peter Bhatia as &quot;Editors of the Year&quot;. The trade journal noted that since Rowe and Bhatia arrived in 1993, the paper and its journalists had won five Pulitzer Prizes and had been finalists a further nine times. &quot;E&amp;P&quot; also cited &quot;an increased focus on specialized reporting; a reorganized newsroom that promotes &quot;team reporting&quot; concepts over traditional beats; and regular training sessions and seminars that most staffers credit for encouraging fresh ideas and competitive approaches.&quot; Pulitzer Board member Richard Oppel, the editor of the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;, called the paper &quot;one of the finest newspapers in the country, easily in the top 10.&quot;

On September 28, 2008, the paper distributed a DVD of &quot;&quot; as an advertising supplement for that day&#x27;s edition, two weeks after &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; and &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; had done the same thing. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; did so despite Portland mayor Tom Potter&#x27;s personal request that publisher Fred Stickel not distribute it because the &quot;tenor of the video contributes towards a climate of distrust towards Muslims&quot;, and because the paper&#x27;s willingness to distribute the DVD bestows upon it &quot;an impression of objectivity and legitimacy it does not deserve.&quot; Stickel cited &quot;freedom of speech&quot;, and an &quot;obligation to keep our advertising columns as open as possible&quot; as reasons for not rejecting the DVD.

Newsroom staff in 2008 was about the same size as it was in 1993, though there were fifty fewer full-time staff members than there were in 2002; about half of those positions were eliminated after a buyout in late 2007. The paper&#x27;s outside news bureaus grew from four to six during her tenure.

====2009====
In 2009, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; was scooped for a third time on a story of an Oregon politician&#x27;s sex scandal, this time involving Mayor Sam Adams about what &quot;Newsweek&quot; called his &quot;public deception and private bad judgment&quot; about his past relationship with a teenage legislative intern. Nigel Jaquiss of &quot;Willamette Week&quot; broke the story after 18 months of investigations; Jaquiss&#x27;s reporting on another sex scandal involving Neil Goldschmidt earned Jaquiss a 2005 Pulitzer Prize. Jaquiss thinks &quot;The Oregonian&quot;&#x27;s failure to follow up on leads that both he and &quot;Oregonian&quot; reporters had received was a case of &quot;one-newspaper towns being a little too cozy with local power brokers.&quot; A media ethics teacher and consultant for The Poynter Institute for Media Studies suggests that the pattern of failure to cover such stories &quot;may have more to do with the culture at &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, which has recently &quot;built its reputation on thoughtful, narrative coverage ...[that] doesn&#x27;t lend itself well to digging up sex scandals.&quot;

In August 2009, the paper&#x27;s owners announced the end of a policy that protected full-time employees from layoffs for economic or technological reasons; the change took effect the following February. In September 2009, publisher Fred Stickel announced his retirement, effective September 18, ending 34 years in the position; his son Patrick, president of the paper, was appointed interim publisher but was not a candidate to succeed his father, and Patrick Stickel retired on December 30, 2009.
N. Christian Anderson III was named as the new publisher in October, and began work in the position at the beginning of November 2009. After more than 16 years as editor, Sandra Rowe retired at the end of 2009. Peter Bhatia, then executive editor, succeeded her as editor.

===2010s===
Layoffs of 37 in February 2010 left the paper with a total of about 750 employees, including more than 200 in the news department. In September, the newspaper announced that its &quot;TV Click&quot; was to be replaced by &quot;TV Weekly&quot;, a publication from the Troy, Michigan-based NTVB Media. Unlike &quot;TV Click&quot;, &quot;TV Weekly&quot; requires a separate subscription fee; &quot;The Oregonian&quot; is following the example of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; and other major newspapers and switching to &quot;some form of &#x27;opt in and pay&#x27; TV sections (rather than dropping the sections) and have found only about 10 percent to 20 percent of subscribers use the sections.&quot;

====2013====
In 2013, publisher N. Christian Anderson announced the paper was restructuring and that beginning October 1, the Oregonian Publishing Company would be dissolved. Two new companies would be formed: the Oregonian Media Group, which will focus on providing content on its online news site, OregonLive.com though it would continue to publish a daily print edition of the paper; and Advance Central Services Oregon, which would provide production, packaging, and distribution support for the new company. Ownership remained with Advance Publications. Though printed seven days a week, home delivery has been reduced to Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. These changes were put into effect, as scheduled, on October 1. The paper also announced that &quot;significant&quot; layoffs were expected. In addition, Anderson announced that the new company would likely move from its downtown Portland building.

====2014–2015====
On April 2, 2014, the paper switched from broadsheet format to the smaller tabloid format.

On April 14, 2014, it was announced that the paper&#x27;s editorial staff—consisting of Mark Hester, Erik Lukens, Susan Nielsen, and Len Reed—had won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing, for their coverage of the state of Oregon&#x27;s public employee retirement system. Reporter Les Zaitz was named as a finalist for Explanatory Reporting for his work on Mexican drug cartels.

Editor Peter Bhatia left the paper in May 2014 to take a teaching position at Arizona State University. In July 2014, it was announced that Mark Katches had been hired as the paper&#x27;s editor, and would also be the Oregonian Media Group&#x27;s vice president of content. Also in July 2014, the newspaper moved its headquarters from the building at 1320 SW Broadway that it had occupied since 1948 to a smaller space elsewhere in downtown Portland. The new headquarters takes up around of space in the Crown Plaza office building, at 1500 SW First Avenue.

N. Christian Anderson left the Oregonian Media Group in May 2015, to become editor and publisher of &quot;The Register-Guard&quot;, in Eugene, Oregon. Anderson became publisher of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; in 2009, subsequently being named president of the Oregonian Media Group when that new company replaced the Oregonian Publishing Company in October 2013, with the title of &quot;publisher&quot; thereafter no longer being used, and in turn was appointed to the new position of chairman of the group in September 2014. Steve Moss succeeded Anderson as Oregonian Media Group president, and the chairman position was to go unfilled.

In June 2015, Advance signed a contract with Signature Graphics to take over printing and distribution of the paper from Advance Central Services Oregon, and announced that it was considering selling its longtime printing plant located near Providence Park. Layoffs of printing-press workers were due to be implemented in August. In February 2017, the Oregonian Publishing Company sold the building for $20 million (~$ in ) to a development partnership which said it planned to tear it down and build a 23-story apartment building on the site, now known as the Press Blocks. Demolition of the former printing complex began in fall 2018.

====2016====
Moss announced in July 2016 that he would depart at the end of August. In the article about Moss&#x27;s impending departure, it was disclosed that the newspaper&#x27;s Sunday circulation was at that time approximately 170,000.

On October 24, 2016, the paper&#x27;s editorial board announced that it would once again decline to endorse a candidate for President of the United States, a practice it first abandoned in 2012. This decision was criticized by some readers, who wondered why the board would offer endorsements in state elections without also taking a position on the presidential race. The board justified its decision by citing the paper&#x27;s general focus on local issues, writing &quot;Our goal as an editorial board is to have an impact in our community. And we don&#x27;t think an endorsement for president would move the needle. So that&#x27;s why we focus our endorsement energy where voters may not have made up their minds and need help with the decision.&quot;

====2018====
Editor Mark Katches left the company in August 2018, to become editor of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, owned by the non-profit Poynter Institute for Media Studies. 
Therese Bottomly, who had worked &quot;The Oregonian&quot; since 1983, was named editor and vice president of content in September 2018.

=== 2020s ===
==== Comments section elimination ====
On January 2, 2020, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; eliminated the comments section of Oregonlive.com. The paper said it was following the trend of other papers in the past decade and said most readers don&#x27;t utilize the comments feature. The paper also said uncivil comments were taking up too many resources to moderate.

==== Paywall ====
In mid June 2020, the paper started rolling out stories tagged &quot;Exclusive&quot; marking the announcement of upcoming paywall. These &quot;exclusive&quot; contents, usually front-page stories, were made subscribers-only partway through July and starting on July 27, 2020, it has been switched over to paywall and restricted to paid subscribers only.

==== Print edition ====
In August 2023, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; announced that the printed version of the paper will be offered only on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, effective January 1, 2024. It will continue publishing daily news online.

In late October 2024, the paper announced it will switch its print edition page format from a tabloid style to broadsheet. The change will go into effect in mid-January 2025.

==Targeted publications==
The staff of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; also produces three &quot;targeted publications&quot;—glossy magazines distributed free of charge to 40,000–45,000 wealthy residents of the Portland metropolitan area, and sold on newsstands to 5,000 others. A fourth glossy magazine, &quot;Explore the Pearl&quot;, is produced in conjunction with the Pearl District Business Association, and mailed to &quot;high-income Portland Metro households&quot; within Lake Oswego, West Linn, Mountain Park, Lakeridge, Forest Heights, Raleigh Hills, Oak Hills, West Hills, Dunthorpe, and Clark County.
== Website ==
OregonLive.com is a website covering local news in Oregon and Southwest Washington. The website serves as the online home of &quot;The Oregonian&quot;. Started in 1997, it is owned by Advance Publications, which also owns &quot;The Oregonian&quot;. Betsy Richter was the original editor of the website, and served through 1998 when Kevin Cosgrove took over as editor-in-chief.

Oregonian Media Group also publishes the website Here is Oregon.

In addition to content from the affiliated newspapers, OregonLive also uses content from the Associated Press.

The construction period was extremely short, achieving a growth rate of five stories per month with only a single shift of 40 workers. The rate of concrete placement per month was and on a typical floor there are 42 windows. Total cost of construction was US$133 million. The tower has a total of of space. The building appeared in a TV advertisement for the Mifal HaPayis national lottery before it was completed, in December 2002. When completed it was the most expensive single building in Israel.

There is now an approved plan for a similar tower of the same height, the Elite Tower, across Jabotinsky Road, on the current site of the Elite Factory.

==Use==
The Moshe Aviv Tower is a multi-use structure. The top 11 floors consist of of residential space divided among 98 apartments. Below that, the bulk of the tower contains of office space.

<doc id="346074" wikidata="Q855235" url="?curid=346074" title="Boracay">
<text>Boracay (; sometimes shortened by non-natives as Bora) is a resort island in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines, located off the northwest coast of Panay Island. It has a total land area of , under the jurisdiction of three barangays in Malay, Aklan, and had a population of 37,802 in 2020.

Boracay was originally inhabited by the Panay Bukidnon and Ati people, but commercial development has led to their severe marginalization since the 1970s.
Apart from its white sand beaches, Boracay is also famous for being one of the world&#x27;s top destinations for relaxation. , it was emerging among the top destinations for tranquility and nightlife.

International travel magazine &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; ranked Boracay as the Best Island in the World in 2012. In 2014, the resort island was at the top of the &quot;Best Islands in the World&quot; list published by the international magazine &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;. In 2016, Boracay headed the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 10 destinations to watch&quot;.

In April 2018, the Philippine government,under President Rodrigo Duterte, decreed a six-month closure of the island for tourists to undertake major renovation works, especially of the sewage system, which had become obsolete and insufficient. The island was administered by the Boracay Inter-agency Task Force during the closure. It reopened in October 2018, with a new set of rules meant to address a variety of issues, and help control tourist growth in the future. Under the new rules, the Boracay beachfront was cleared of the masseuses, bonfires, beach vendors and sunset bonfires. Buildings were bulldozed and beach businesses set back to create a 30 metre buffer zone from the waterline.

The Boracay Ati-atihan in January 2024 witnessed a record-breaking number of tourists, with 36,741 people participating in the event. This festival, which celebrates the cultural heritage of the Ati indigenous people, has been a major draw for tourists and is set to be elevated as a major tourism attraction for the island starting in 2025.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Boracay&quot; is attributed to different origins. The first one that came from the Ati people says that the name of the island came from the Inati words &quot;bora&quot;, meaning bubbles, and &quot;bocay&quot;, meaning white. Another theory suggests that the name is derived from the local word &#x27;borac,&#x27; which means &#x27;white cotton,&#x27; referencing the color and texture of Boracay&#x27;s white, sugary, and powdery sand. Yet another version dating back to the Spanish era says the name is derived from &quot;sagay&quot;, the word for a shell, and &quot;boray&quot;, the word for seed.

The island is sometimes referred to as simply &quot;Bora&quot; by outsiders for convenience. However locals including tourism stakeholders have highly discouraged the use of the name which is widely considered to be derogatory or disrespectful. Among the reasons include to distinguish Boracay from the island of Bora Bora of the French Polynesia.

The municipal government of Malay passed an ordinance in February 2011, mandating its municipal licensing office to refuse licenses to businesses seeking to operate under a name including &quot;Bora&quot; rather than &quot;Boracay&quot;. Usage of the diminutive is also prohibited in promotional materials and business activities.

==History==
===Pre-colonial period===
Before the Spanish colonization of the Philippines in the 16th century, Boracay was populated by Ati people. It was known to the Iberian conquerors as &quot;Buracay&quot;. At the time of contact with the Europeans, &quot;Buracay&quot; had a population of one hundred people, who cultivated rice on the island and augmented their income by raising goats.

The Tumandok people also established an indigenous presence on the island, although the identities of the two indigenous peoples is often conflated. A 1905 report by the Philippine Commission documented the continuing presence of both groups on the island. referred to there as &quot;Buracay&quot;.

===Contemporary period===
====As an agricultural island====
Boracay was previously part of the province of Capiz. It was under the jurisdiction of the town of Buruanga until the municipality of Malay was established on June 15, 1949. The municipality, as well as the island, became part of Aklan, which became an independent province on April 25, 1956.

Before the advent of tourism, Boracay was largely an agricultural community. Around 1910, Sofía Gonzáles Tirol and her husband Lamberto Hontiveros Tirol (a town judge on the Panay mainland) took ownership of substantial properties on the island. They planted coconuts, fruit trees and greenery. Others followed the Tirols, and cultivation and development of the island gradually spread. The production of copra and fishing were major industries in the island.

However, due to overharvesting by fishers and the destruction of coral reef due to cyanide fishing, the fishing industry saw a decline. By the 1980s, the price of copra had declined, encouraging tourism as an alternative source of income for the island.

In 1978, President Ferdinand Marcos issued a proclamation naming Boracay among a number of islands, coves and peninsulas declared as tourist zones.

====Influx of tourism (1970s to 1997)====

Tourism came to the island beginning sometime in the 1970s. In 1970, the movies &quot;Nam&#x27;s Angels&quot; (released in the U.S. as &quot;The Losers&quot;) and &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot; used filming locations on Boracay and Caticlan. There was an influx of Western tourists after German writer Jens Peter called it &quot;paradise on Earth&quot; in his book about the Philippines in 1978. In the 1980s, the island became popular as a budget destination for backpackers. By the 1990s, Boracay&#x27;s beaches were being acclaimed as the best in the world. However, in 1997, tourist arrivals to the resort island dropped 60 percent due to the increase of coliform bacteria from poor sewage and septic systems on the island.

====1997 to 2018====

The condition of Boracay in 1997 led to the installment of a potable water supply system, a sewage treatment plant and a solid waste disposal system, operated by the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA). Connection of businesses and households to the system was not universal, and environmental problems persisted.

Then-president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared Boracay a Special Tourism Zone in 2005, and in April 2006 she gave the PTA administrative control over the island while mandating the agency to coordinate with the provincial government of Aklan.

In 2012, the Philippine Department of Tourism reported that Boracay had been named the world&#x27;s second best beach after Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

====2018 closure and rehabilitation====
Due to worsening environmental conditions in Boracay, President Rodrigo Duterte in February 2018 said he planned to close the resort island, which he described as a &quot;cesspool&quot;, on April 26, 2018, instructing Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Roy Cimatu to resolve the issue. In a cabinet meeting, President Duterte approved the full closure of the island for six months, effective April 26, 2018, to rehabilitate and resolve the environmental issues surrounding Boracay. On May 30, 2018, President Duterte declared that he planned to make the entire Boracay a land reform area and wanted to first prioritize the island&#x27;s residents.

In April 2018, the Philippine Army&#x27;s 301st Infantry Brigade confirmed that 200 soldiers were deployed to Boracay to secure the island during its shutdown starting April 26.

On October 26, 2018, Boracay was reopened to the public with work on the island&#x27;s infrastructure still in progress. In April 2019, numerous Chinese-owned businesses were opened in Boracay, and additionally, there are about 300 mainland Chinese residents. In April 2019, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said that the Department of Labor and Employment has no control over foreign businesses setting up shop on the island, but that it vows to ensure that no Chinese national could take jobs fit for Filipinos.

Efforts to maintain the pristine condition of the beaches and the introduction of environmentally-friendly practices such as the use of biodegradable products and electric tricycles have significantly contributed to the island&#x27;s recovery. The absence of plastic and a renewed focus on sustainability were key highlights of introduced in 2023.

Following the Boracay cleanup, Duterte distributed 623 certificates of land-ownership award covering of land in Boracay and Aklan to the area&#x27;s Ati inhabitants and other beneficiaries.

==== 2020 COVID-19 pandemic ====
The municipality of Malay, including Boracay island, was closed to tourism effective March 19, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The island would eventually be re-opened to tourists with COVID-19 protocols implemented as cautionary measure.

====Revocation of Ati families&#x27; CLOA====
Under the Bongbong Marcos administration in late March 2024, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), upon the request of private land developers, cancelled the Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) of five lots in Boracay owned by Ati indigenous peoples. The lots, which were awarded by the Duterte administration to the Ati members in 2018, had been barricaded by armed men, who cited a March 5, 2024 decision by the DAR concluding that the land awarded was &quot;not suitable for agriculture&quot;. The Boracay Ati Tribal Organization (BATO) later urged the Commission on Human Rights to intervene in the dispute, leading DAR Secretary Conrado Estrella III to order the distribution of land to the affected Ati members, albeit to a yet undisclosed location.

==Geography==
Boracay Island is located off the northwest corner of the mainland Panay and belongs to the province of Aklan in the Western Visayas region, or Region VI, of the Philippines. It is northwest of the provincial capital, Kalibo; northwest of the regional capital, Iloilo City; and southeast of the national capital, Manila. The island is approximately seven kilometers long, dog-bone shaped, with the narrowest spot being less than one kilometer wide, and has a total land area of .

South-facing Cagban Beach is located across a small strait from the jetty port at Caticlan on Panay Island, and the Cagban jetty port serves as Boracay&#x27;s main entry and exit point during most of the year. When wind and sea conditions dictate, east-facing Tambisaan Beach serves as an alternative entry and exit point.
Boracay&#x27;s two primary tourism beaches, White Beach and Bulabog Beach, are located on opposite sides of the island&#x27;s narrow central area. White Beach faces westward and Bulabog Beach faces eastward. The island also has several other beaches.

White Beach, the main tourism beach, is about long and is lined with resorts, hotels, lodging houses, restaurants, and other tourism-related businesses. In the central portion, for about two kilometers, there is a footpath known as the Beachfront Path separating the beach itself from the establishments located along it. North and south of the Beachfront Path, beachfront establishments do literally front along the beach itself. Several roads and paths connect the Beachfront Path with Boracay&#x27;s Main Road, a vehicular road which runs the length of the island. At the extreme northern end of White Beach, a footpath runs around the headland there and connects White Beach with Diniwid Beach.

Bulabog Beach, across the island from White Beach, is the second most popular tourism beach on the island and Boracay&#x27;s main windsurfing and kiteboarding area.

Boracay is divided for land use and conservation purposes into of preserved forestland and of agricultural land.

===Governance===
The three barangays comprising Boracay island, Balabag, Manoc-Manoc, and Yapak, are part of the municipality of Malay in the province of Aklan. 
===Climate===

Weather in Boracay is generally divided into two seasonal weather patterns known locally as the Amihan and Habagat seasons. In the Visayan language, &quot;Amihan&quot; means &quot;a cool northeast wind&quot;, and &quot;Habagat&quot; means &quot;west or southwest wind; southwest monsoon&quot;.
The Amihan season is characterized by moderate temperatures, little or no rainfall, and a prevailing wind from the northeast. The Habagat season is characterized by hot and humid weather, frequent heavy rainfall, and a prevailing wind from the west.

On Boracay, the main indicator of the switch between the Amihan and Habagat seasonal patterns is the switch in wind direction. In most years this transition is abrupt and occurs overnight. In some years there is a period of perhaps a week or two where the wind will switch between Amihan and Habagat patterns several times before settling into the pattern for the new season. As a rule of thumb, Boracay will be in the Amihan weather pattern from sometime in October to sometime in March and in the Habagat weather pattern for the remainder of the year.

Temperatures in Malay municipality province generally ranged between in 2009–2019, with a low of in February 2014 and high of in October 2018, ranging more widely in 2019, with a low of in March and a high of in May. During Tropical storm periods, temperatures can fall below . Tropical storms can impact Boracay at any time of year, but are most likely to be seen during the Habagat season.

==Environment==

The rapid growth of tourism has caused environmental damage on the island. &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; magazine called Boracay &quot;the poster child for overtourism&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called Boracay an &quot;island paradise ruined by tourism&quot;.

===Fauna===

At least three species of flying foxes have been recorded to inhabit Boracay namely the giant golden-crowned flying fox (&quot;Aceradon jubatus&quot;), the giant fruit bat (&quot;Pteropus vampyrus&quot;), and the small flying fox (&quot;Pteropus hypomelanus&quot;). Their population is concentrated on the northern side of the island in Barangay Yapak, where the hunting of bats was made illegal through a local ordinance.

According to the Coastal Ecosystem Conservation and Adaptive Management (CECAM), a study led by the Japan International Cooperation Agency conducted from 2010 to 2015 noted a 70.5 percent decrease of Boracay&#x27;s coral cover from 1988 to 2011. The study attributed the increased drop in coral cover from 2008 to 2011 to the 38.4 percent increase of tourist arrivals combined with poorly monitored snorkeling activity in coral-rich areas. The Boracay Foundation Inc. (BFI) made efforts to remedy the situation by launching a &quot;refurbishment&quot; program for the corals. In 2017, the BFI claimed the number of corals in Boracay increased from 15 to 20 percent since 2015 due to its project.

===Sanitation===

Boracay has been experiencing an increased coliform bacteria population since the 1990s, which contributed to a 60 percent decline in tourist arrivals in 1997. Although a potable water supply system, a solid waste disposal system, as well as a sewage treatment plant which began operation in 2003 were installed to remedy the insufficient sewage and septic conditions in the island, environmental concerns regarding coliform bacteria persisted due to noncompliance of some business establishments in the island.

In 2004, only 51 percent of hotels and restaurants in Boracay and 25 percent of all households were connected to the island&#x27;s central sewage system. In 2005, Boracay was declared a &quot;special tourism zone&quot;. In April 2006, Arroyo gave the PTA administrative control over Boracay, to be exercised in coordination with the provincial government. In 2009, Boracay Island Water Co. (BIWC), won a contract to improve the supply of potable water and install an efficient sewerage system.

Boracay has experienced abnormally high algae growth since February 2015, due to sewage being dumped into the waters surrounding the islands. In early 2018, 50 to 60 percent of all establishments in Boracay were compliant to the Clean Water Act of 2004 according to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

==Tourism==
Partly because of its wind and weather patterns, tourism in Boracay is at its peak during the &quot;amihan&quot; season (which generally starts around the Christmas season and runs through February). During &quot;amihan&quot;, the prevailing wind blows from the east. Boracay&#x27;s main tourism area, White Beach, is on the western side of the island and is sheltered from the wind. During the Amihan season, the water off White Beach is often glassy-smooth. On the eastern side of the island, hills on the northern and southern ends of the island channel the Amihan season wind from the east onshore, onto Bulabog Beach in the central part of the island&#x27;s eastern side. This makes the reef-protected waters off that beach relatively safe and ideal for scuba diving, windsurfing, and kiteboarding / kitesurfing.

In June 2011, it was reported that Megaworld Corporation, a real estate development group led by Andrew Tan had earmarked to develop tourism estates in Boracay and Cavite. The planned Boracay project, Boracay Newcoast, involves four hotels with 1,500 rooms, a plaza and an entertainment center.

Other resorts in Boracay include Discovery Shores, a luxury five-star resort managed by a Filipino hospitality group called The Discovery Leisure Company Inc. and owned by Discovery World Corp. The building, with 88 suites, a spa, and four restaurants and bars, stands at Station One on the White Beach, and has been described as &quot;more Miami chic than hidden oasis.&quot;

The island has the highest density of merchants that accept bitcoin outside of El Salvador. There is a movement to dub the island &quot;Bitcoin Island&quot; and bootstrap a circular economy similar to Bitcoin Beach.

===Leisure activities===
Leisure activities available on or near Boracay include horseback riding, scuba diving, helmet diving, snorkeling, windsurfing, kiteboarding, cliff diving, parasailing and banana boat.

Boracay is the site of an 18-hole par 72 golf course designed by Graham Marsh. In addition, , Boracay has in excess of 350 beach resorts offering more than 2,000 rooms ranging in quality from five-star to budget accommodation. In addition, Boracay offers a wide range of restaurants, bars, pubs, and nightclubs.

A landmark natural rock formation, Boracay&#x27;s Rock, juts prominently directly in front of Willy&#x27;s Beach Resort.

===Statistics===
According to the Department of Tourism of the Philippines, there was a recorded 1,725,483 visitors to Boracay in 2016. This was an increase of 250,000 from the previous year. Assuming the average length of stay of tourists to Boracay is three days, the number of tourists on the island each day was calculated at 14,182. According to Malay municipal records more than two million tourists visited the island in 2017.

Boracay is aiming for 2.3 million tourist arrivals in 2024, a slight increase from 2023&#x27;s target, indicating a robust interest in Boracay as a prime tourist destination.

===Marhaba Boracay===
In September 2024, Secretary Christina Frasco launched Megaworld&#x27;s Marhaba, a halal tourism cove in the Boracay Newcoast private beach in front of “Lapus-Lapus” rock formation.

Boracay has been a competitive venue for the Asian Windsurfing Tour, with the week-long Boracay International Funboard Cup competition usually held in January on Bulabog Beach. . CNNGo, a division of CNN focused on travel/lifestyle/entertainment, selected the Boracay International Funboard Competition on the weekend of January 22–24 as one of its 52 weekend recommendations for 2010.

Dragon boat races are held annually on Boracay under the auspices of the Philippine Dragon Boat Federation, with teams coming from around the Philippines and from other Asian nations to compete. The races usually take place sometime in April or May. The 2012 Boracay Edition of the PDBF International Club Crew Challenge to was scheduled for April 26–28, in 2012.

The Boracay Open Asian Beach Ultimate Tournament, an ultimate frisbee event, with players coming from around the Philippines and from other International nations, has been held annually since 2003, usually in March or April.

=== Asian Games Centennial Festival ===
Boracay was scheduled to host a special multi-sport event in 2013. At its 31st General Assembly in Macau, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) decided to create the &quot;Asian Games Centennial Festival&quot; in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Oriental Games (later Far Eastern Championship Games). OCA awarded the hosting rights to the Philippines as it had been the host of the first Far Eastern Championship Games held in Manila 100 years earlier. The festival was to be held on Boracay in November 2013. However, it had to be rescheduled and relocated because of Typhoon Haiyan, with the ceremony eventually taking place at the Sofitel Plaza in Manila on January 17, 2014. The 32nd OCA General Assembly was to be held in conjunction with the games.

==Culture==

The first settlers of Boracay were a Negrito people called the Ati, and who spoke a distinctive Philippine language called Inati. Later settlers brought other languages to the island, including Aklanon (as Boracay is part of Aklan province), Hiligaynon (Ilonggo), Kinaray-a, Capiznon, other Visayan languages, Filipino, and English.

The well-known Ati-Atihan Festival takes place each January in Kalibo on nearby Panay Island. A much smaller Ati-Atihan festival is celebrated on Boracay, usually in the second or third week of January. 

==Transportation==

Boracay island is separated from Panay island by a narrow strait. The island is located opposite the barangay of Caticlan in the municipality of Malay, Aklan. Transportation across the strait is provided by boats operating from the Caticlan jetty port. Cagban Port serves as the primary sea transportation hub for passengers going into Boracay but the island lacks any formal seaport for cargo transport and waste disposal. Goods are delivered into Boracay through an informal port near the Cagban Port.

Boracay is served by two airports in Aklan: the Kalibo International Airport and Godofredo P. Ramos Airport (commonly referred to as the Caticlan airport).

The three main modes of transport are via motor-tricycles and electric-tricycles (e-trikes) along the main road, or by walking along the beaches. Pedicabs, known as sikads, are also available along the Beachfront Path. Other means of transportation include mountain bikes, quadbikes and motorbikes, all of which can be rented. It was reported in October 2018 that the island will see modern jeepneys, solar-powered shuttles, and hop-on hop-off buses serviced by Grab, and that the Department of Energy will donate 200 e-trikes to the Malay local government under a project funded by the Asian Development Bank.

, the municipal government of Malay was encouraging motorcycle operators to transition to e-trikes in their coordinated efforts to promote environment-friendly public transportation. Diesel-motor tricycles are expected to be phased out by August 2018.

In 2019, San Miguel Corporation proposed a limited-access bridge to connect the island of Boracay to the mainland of Panay. As of February 2024, the unsolicited project proposal is under negotiation and has been included in the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) funding for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects. Upon completion, travel time between Iloilo City and Boracay will be reduced to 2.5 hours from the current 6 to 7 hours through the bridge and the Iloilo–Capiz–Aklan Expressway, both of which are part of the DPWH&#x27;s PPP infrastructure projects.

== Awards and recognition ==
Boracay Island earned the eighth spot in the annual Condé Nast Traveler (CNT) readers&#x27; choice awards for top islands to visit in 2021.
