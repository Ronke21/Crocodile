<text>Remington Rand, Inc. was an early American business machine manufacturer, originally a typewriter manufacturer and in a later incarnation the manufacturer of the UNIVAC line of mainframe computers. Formed in 1927 following a merger, Remington Rand was a diversified conglomerate making other office equipment, electric shavers, etc. The Remington Rand Building at 315 Park Avenue South in New York City is a 20-floor skyscraper completed in 1911. After 1955, Remington Rand had a long series of mergers and acquisitions that eventually resulted in the formation of Unisys.

During World War II, Remington Rand produced M1911 pistols used by the United States Armed Forces.

==History==
Remington Rand was formed in 1927 by the merger of the Remington Typewriter Company and Rand Kardex Corporation. One of its earliest factories, the former Herschell–Spillman Motor Company Complex, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Within the first year, Remington Rand acquired the Dalton Adding Machine Company, the Powers Accounting Machine Company, the Baker-Vawter Company, and the Kalamazoo Loose Leaf Binder Company. From 1936 to 1937 Remington Rand workers went on strike, which resulted in violence and the loss of jobs.

From 1942 to 1945, Remington Rand was a contract manufacturer of the M1911A1 .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol used by the United States Armed Forces during World War II. Remington Rand produced more M1911A1 pistols than any other wartime manufacturer. Remington Rand ranked 66th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

In 1950, Remington Rand acquired the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, founded by the makers of the ENIAC, and in 1952, they acquired Engineering Research Associates (ERA), both of which were pioneers in electronic computing. At that time, Remington Rand was one of the biggest computer companies in the United States.

On June 14, 1951, the company&#x27;s first computer was introduced, the UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer). Many branches of the U.S. military, including the Air Force and the Army, were among the first to use the computers. When companies started to buy the computers, they would leave the computers at the Remington Rand facility since they were so big and bulky. The UNIVAC I was about the size of a one-car garage, and 46 of them were built and sold for $1 million each.

Remington Rand was acquired by Sperry Corporation in 1955 to form Sperry Rand (later shortened to Sperry). However, the brand &quot;Remington Rand&quot; continued as a subdivision for many years. Sperry merged in 1986 with Burroughs to form Unisys.

Remington Rand was a regular co-sponsor of the CBS panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; throughout much of the show&#x27;s run.

===Strike of 1936–1937===
Remington Rand had a major worker strike between 1936 and 1937 when the company bought the Noiseless Typewriter Company in 1924, and the Noiseless Typewriter Company kept their company name and their workers were getting paid by Remington Rand. Also in the summer of 1936, James Rand Jr. tried to break up the strike by firing union workers and hiring new workers to take their places. Rand Jr. also threatened to close the plant. The strike got so severe that state and local police helped keep the strikers from throwing stones at workers and vehicles.

The strike was started by the Federal Union, which was affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). James Rand Jr. used the idea of the Mohawk Valley Formula to try to break up the strike. The Mohawk Valley Formula was used to spread propaganda about the union strikes. The propaganda was carried out by spreading rumors and lambasting the union strikers for hurting their families, by having no income for their households since they were out of work. The propaganda was also often used to call the union strikers communist or anarchist, to make the public hate the union strikers.

In 1937, the NLRB decided in favor of the workers, and the board ordered Rand to stop interfering with employees&#x27; unions and their right to organize. After the strike ended in the summer 1940, the Middletown plant had closed permanently, leaving 1,200 employees without jobs. There were still legal battles being fought for the employees that were in the strike while the plant was closing. The Middletown plant was run by strikebreakers until the closing of the plant in 1940. Today the building is the home of Stubborn Beauty Brewery.

==Products==

===Typewriters===
Initially produced by E. Remington and Sons, Remington typewriters were the first to use the QWERTY keyboard layout. Remington had bought the design from its inventor, Christopher Sholes. The Remington No.1 was the first model released. All keys were uppercase. Remington spun off Remington Typewriter Company in 1886, and after the 1927 merger, the Remington Rand Corp. continued to manufacture and sell typewriters.

===Colt M1911===

During World War II, Remington Rand produced 958,764 licensed copies of the M1911 pistol for the war effort between 1943 and 1945. These were shipped to the Springfield Armory as each contract was fulfilled. Colt Manufacturing Company was unable to fulfill the demand and was assisted by Remington Rand, Singer Corporation, Union Switch &amp; Signal, Remington Arms and the Ithaca Gun Company. After the war all contracts for the 1911A1 were cancelled.

===UNIVAC===
The UNIVAC I &quot;(UNIVersal Automatic Computer I)&quot; was the second commercial computer made in the United States.
It was designed principally by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the inventors of the ENIAC. Design work was begun by their company, Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, and was completed after the company had been acquired by Remington Rand. (In the years before successor models of the UNIVAC I appeared, the machine was simply known as &quot;the UNIVAC&quot;.)

The first UNIVAC was delivered to the United States Census Bureau on March 31, 1951, and was dedicated on June 14 that year. The fifth machine (built for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission) was used by CBS to predict the result of the 1952 U.S. presidential election. With a sample of 1% of the voting population it predicted Eisenhower&#x27;s win.

In 1949, Remington Rand designed the Remington Rand 409, a control panel programmed punched card calculator (but not introduced as a product until 1952 as the UNIVAC 60 then in 1953 as the UNIVAC 120 with double the memory).

They also sold punched card systems, beginning with the 1928 acquisition of the Powers Accounting Machine Company and ending in the 1950s.

===Electric razors===
Remington Rand also made electric razors. The Remington brand of razor was originally produced by a division of Remington Rand, starting in 1937. Sperry Corporation sold the division in 1979 to Victor Kiam, who became the company spokesman of the new Remington Products Company. His line, &quot;I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company&quot; became one of the more memorable advertising slogans of the early 1980s.

Remington Products was sold in 2003 to the battery manufacturer Rayovac. Rayovac is now Spectrum Brands.

<text>The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, also known as the Great Lisbon earthquake, impacted Portugal, the Iberian Peninsula, and Northwest Africa on the morning of Saturday, 1 November, Feast of All Saints, at around 09:40 local time. In combination with subsequent fires and a tsunami, the earthquake almost completely destroyed Lisbon and adjoining areas. Seismologists estimate the Lisbon earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7 or greater on the moment magnitude scale, with its epicenter in the Atlantic Ocean about west-southwest of Cape St. Vincent, a cape in Algarve region, and about southwest of Lisbon.

Chronologically, it was the third known large-scale earthquake to hit the city (following those of 1332 and 1531). Estimates place the death toll in Lisbon around 30,000–40,000. A further 10,000 may have died in Morocco.

The earthquake accentuated political tensions in Portugal and profoundly disrupted the Portuguese Empire. The event was widely discussed and dwelt upon by European Enlightenment philosophers, and inspired major developments in theodicy. As the first earthquake studied scientifically for its effects over a large area, it led to the birth of modern seismology and earthquake engineering.

==Earthquake and tsunami==
The earthquake struck on the morning of 1 November 1755, All Saints&#x27; Day. Contemporary reports state that the earthquake lasted from three and a half to six minutes, causing fissures wide in the city center. Survivors rushed to the open space of the docks for safety and watched as the sea receded, revealing a plain of mud littered with lost cargo and shipwrecks. Approximately 40 minutes after the earthquake, a tsunami engulfed the harbor and downtown area, rushing up the Tagus river &quot;so fast that several people riding on horseback ... were forced to gallop as fast as possible to the upper grounds for fear of being carried away.&quot; It was followed by two more waves. Candles lit in homes and churches all around the city for All Saints&#x27; Day were knocked over, starting a fire that developed into a firestorm which burned for hours in the city, asphyxiating people up to from the blaze.
Lisbon was not the only Portuguese city affected by the catastrophe. Throughout the south of the country, in particular the Algarve, destruction was rampant. The tsunami destroyed some coastal fortresses in the Algarve and, at lower levels, it razed several houses. Almost all the coastal towns and villages of the Algarve were heavily damaged, except Faro, which was protected by the sandy banks of Ria Formosa. In Lagos, the waves reached the top of the city walls. Other towns in different Portuguese regions, such as Peniche, Cascais, Setúbal and even Covilhã (which is located near the Serra da Estrela mountain range in central inland Portugal) were visibly affected by the earthquake, the tsunami, or both. The shock waves of the earthquake destroyed part of Covilhã&#x27;s castle walls and its large towers and damaged several other buildings in Cova da Beira, as well as in Salamanca, Spain. In Setúbal, parts of the Fort of São Filipe de Setúbal were damaged.

On the island of Madeira, Funchal and many smaller settlements suffered significant damage. Almost all of the ports in the Azores archipelago suffered most of their destruction from the tsunami, with the sea penetrating about inland. Current and former Portuguese towns in northern Africa were also affected by the earthquake. Places such as Ceuta (ceded by Portugal to Spain in 1668) and Mazagon, where the tsunami hit hard the coastal fortifications of both towns, in some cases going over it, and flooding the harbor area, were affected. In Spain, the tsunamis swept the Andalusian Atlantic Coast, damaging the city of Cadiz.


Shocks from the earthquake were felt throughout Europe as far as Finland and in North Africa, and according to some sources even in Greenland and the Caribbean. Tsunamis as tall as swept along the coast of North Africa, and struck Martinique and Barbados across the Atlantic Ocean. A tsunami hit Cornwall on the southern British coast. Galway, on the west coast of Ireland, was also hit, resulting in partial destruction of the &quot;Spanish Arch&quot; section of the city wall. In County Clare, Aughinish Island was created when a low lying connection to the mainland was washed away. At Kinsale, several vessels were whirled round in the harbor, and water poured into the marketplace.

In 2015, it was determined that the tsunami waves may have reached the coast of Brazil, then a colony of Portugal. Letters sent by Brazilian authorities at the time of the earthquake describe damage and destruction caused by gigantic waves.

Although seismologists and geologists have always agreed that the epicenter was in the Atlantic to the west of the Iberian Peninsula, its exact location has been a subject of considerable debate. Early hypotheses had proposed the Gorringe Ridge, about south-west of Lisbon, until simulations showed that a location closer to the shore of Portugal was required to comply with the observed effects of the tsunami. A 1992 seismic reflection survey of the ocean floor along the Azores–Gibraltar Transform Fault detected a thrust fault southwest of Cape St. Vincent, with a dip-slip throw of more than . This structure may have created the primary tectonic event.

==Casualties and damage==
Economic historian Álvaro Pereira estimated that of Lisbon&#x27;s population at the time of approximately 200,000 people, 30,000–40,000 were killed. Another 10,000 may have died in Morocco. A 2009 study of contemporary reports relating to the 1 November event found them vague and difficult to separate from reports of another local series of earthquakes on 18–19 November. Pereira estimated the total death toll in Portugal, Spain and Morocco from the earthquake and the resulting fires and tsunami at 40,000 to 50,000 people.

Eighty-five percent of Lisbon&#x27;s buildings were destroyed, including famous palaces and libraries, as well as most examples of Portugal&#x27;s distinctive 16th-century Manueline architecture. Several buildings that had suffered little earthquake damage were destroyed by the subsequent fire. The new Lisbon opera house (the &quot;Ópera do Tejo&quot;), opened seven months before, burned to the ground. The Royal Ribeira Palace, which stood just beside the Tagus river in the modern square Praça do Comércio, was destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami. Inside, the 70,000-volume royal library as well as hundreds of works of art, including paintings by Titian, Rubens, and Correggio, were lost. The royal archives disappeared together with detailed historical records of explorations by Vasco da Gama and other early navigators. The palace of Henrique de Meneses, 3rd Marquis of Louriçal, which housed 18,000 books, was also destroyed. The earthquake damaged several major churches in Lisbon, namely Lisbon Cathedral, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Santa Catarina, São Vicente de Fora, and the Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição Velha. The Royal Hospital of All Saints (the largest public hospital at the time) in the Rossio square was consumed by fire and hundreds of patients burned to death. The tomb of national hero Nuno Álvares Pereira was also lost. Visitors to Lisbon may still walk the ruins of the Carmo Convent, which were preserved to remind Lisboners of the destruction. Most of the documentation of the 1722 Algarve earthquake sent to Lisbon for archiving became lost after the fire that followed the 1755 earthquake.

==Relief and reconstruction efforts==

The royal family escaped unharmed from the catastrophe: King Joseph I of Portugal and the court had left the city, after attending Mass at sunrise, fulfilling the wish of one of the king&#x27;s daughters to spend the holiday away from Lisbon. After the catastrophe, Joseph I developed a fear of living within walls, and the court was accommodated in a huge complex of tents and pavilions in the hills of Ajuda, then on the outskirts of Lisbon. The king&#x27;s claustrophobia never waned, and it was only after Joseph&#x27;s death that his daughter Maria I of Portugal began building the royal Ajuda Palace, which still stands on the site of the old tented camp. Like the king, the prime minister Sebastião de Melo (1st Marquis of Pombal) survived the earthquake. When asked what was to be done, Pombal reportedly replied &quot;bury the dead and heal the living&quot;, and set about organizing relief and rehabilitation efforts. Firefighters were sent to extinguish the raging flames, and teams of workers and ordinary citizens were ordered to remove the thousands of corpses before disease could spread. Contrary to custom and against the wishes of the Church, many corpses were loaded onto barges and buried at sea beyond the mouth of the Tagus. To prevent disorder in the ruined city, the Portuguese Army was deployed and gallows were constructed at high points around the city to deter looters; more than thirty people were publicly executed. The army prevented many able-bodied citizens from fleeing, pressing them into relief and reconstruction work.

A project proposed that a new royal palace be built in Campo de Ourique as the new royal residence in 1760, but was later abandoned due to a lack of priority or interest in a palace being built in the Campo de Ourique neighborhood of Lisbon.

The king and the prime minister immediately launched efforts to rebuild the city. On 4 December 1755, a little more than a month after the earthquake, Manuel da Maia, chief engineer to the realm, presented his plans for the re-building of Lisbon. Maia presented four options from abandoning Lisbon to building a completely new city. The first, and cheapest, plan was to rebuild the old city using recycled materials. The second and third plans proposed widening certain streets. The fourth option boldly proposed razing the entire Baixa quarter and &quot;laying out new streets without restraint&quot;. This last option was chosen by the king and his minister.

In less than a year, the city was cleared of debris. Keen to have a new and perfectly ordered city, the king commissioned the construction of big squares, rectilinear, large avenues and widened streetsthe new &quot;mottos&quot; of Lisbon.

The Pombaline buildings are among the earliest seismically protected constructions in Europe. Small wooden models were built for testing, and earthquakes were simulated by marching troops around them. Lisbon&#x27;s &quot;new&quot; Lower Town, known today as the Pombaline Lower Town (&quot;Baixa Pombalina&quot;), is one of the city&#x27;s famed attractions. Sections of other Portuguese cities, such as the Vila Real de Santo António in Algarve, were also rebuilt along Pombaline principles.

The Casa Pia, a Portuguese institution founded by Maria I (known as &quot;A Pia&quot;, &quot;Maria the Pious&quot;), and organized by Police Intendant Pina Manique in 1780, was founded following the social disarray of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. The purpose of the institution was to provide shelter and schooling to children in need.

==Effect on society, economy, and philosophy==

The earthquake had wide-ranging effects on the lives of the populace and intelligentsia. The earthquake had struck on an important religious holiday and had destroyed almost every important church in the city, causing anxiety and confusion amongst the citizens of a staunch and devout Roman Catholic country. Theologians and philosophers focused and speculated on the religious cause and message, seeing the earthquake as a manifestation of divine judgment.

=== Economy ===
A 2009 study estimated that the earthquake cost between 32 and 48 per cent of Portugal&#x27;s GDP. Also, &quot;in spite of strict controls, prices and wages remained volatile in the years after the tragedy. The recovery from the earthquake also led to a rise in the wage premium of construction workers. More significantly, the earthquake became an opportunity to reform the economy and to reduce the economic semi-dependency vis-à-vis Britain.&quot;

=== Philosophy ===
The earthquake and its aftermath strongly influenced the intelligentsia of the European Age of Enlightenment. The noted writer-philosopher Voltaire used the earthquake in and in his (&quot;Poem on the Lisbon disaster&quot;). Voltaire&#x27;s attacks the notion that all is for the best in this, &quot;the best of all possible worlds&quot;, a world closely supervised by a benevolent deity. The Lisbon disaster provided a counterexample for Voltaire. Theodor Adorno wrote, &quot;the earthquake of Lisbon sufficed to cure Voltaire of the theodicy of Leibniz&quot; (&quot;Negative Dialectics&quot; 361). Jean-Jacques Rousseau was also influenced by the devastation following the earthquake, the severity of which he believed was due to too many people living within the close quarters of the city. Rousseau used the earthquake as an argument against cities as part of his desire for a more naturalistic way of life.

Immanuel Kant published three separate texts in 1756 on the Lisbon earthquake. As a younger man, fascinated with the earthquake, he collected all the information available in news pamphlets and formulated a theory of the causes of earthquakes. Kant&#x27;s theory, which involved shifts in huge caverns filled with hot gases, though inaccurate, was one of the first systematic attempts to explain earthquakes in natural rather than supernatural terms. According to Walter Benjamin, Kant&#x27;s slim early book on the earthquake &quot;probably represents the beginnings of scientific geography in Germany. And certainly the beginnings of seismology&quot;.

Werner Hamacher has claimed that the consequences of the earthquake extended into the vocabulary of philosophy, making the common metaphor of firm &quot;grounding&quot; for philosophers&#x27; arguments shaky and uncertain: &quot;Under the impression exerted by the Lisbon earthquake, which touched the European mind in one [of] its more sensitive epochs, the metaphor of ground and tremor completely lost their apparent innocence; they were no longer merely figures of speech&quot; (263). Hamacher claims that the foundational certainty of René Descartes&#x27; philosophy began to shake following the Lisbon earthquake.

=== Politics ===

The earthquake had a major impact on politics. The prime minister, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, was the favourite of the king, but the aristocracy despised him as an upstart son of a country squire. The prime minister, in turn, disliked the old nobles, whom he considered corrupt and incapable of practical action. Before 1 November 1755, there had been a constant struggle for power and royal favour, but the competent response of the Marquis of Pombal effectively severed the power of the old aristocratic factions. However, the silent opposition and resentment of King Joseph I began to rise, which would culminate with the attempted assassination of the king in 1758 and the subsequent elimination of the powerful Duke of Aveiro and the Távora family.

In 1752, a Sebastianist predicted that a terrible earthquake would destroy Lisbon on All Saints&#x27; Day. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake struck on All Saints&#x27; Day, there was a surge of converts to Sebastianism.

==Development of seismology==

The prime minister&#x27;s response was not limited to the practicalities of reconstruction. He ordered a query sent to all parishes of the country regarding the earthquake and its effects. Questions included the following:
* At what time did the earthquake begin, and how long did the earthquake last?
* Did you perceive the shock to be greater from one direction than another? Example, from north to south? Did buildings seem to fall more to one side than the other?
* How many people died and were any of them distinguished?
* Did the sea rise or fall first, and how many hands did it rise above the normal?
* If fire broke out, how long did it last and what damage did it cause?

The answers to those and other questions are still archived in the Torre do Tombo, the national historical archive. Studying and cross-referencing the priests&#x27; accounts, modern scientists were able to reconstruct the event from a scientific perspective. Without the questionnaire designed by the Marquis of Pombal, that would have been impossible. Because Pombal was the first to attempt an objective scientific description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists.

==In popular culture==

The 1755 Lisbon Earthquake features prominently as a plot point in Candide by Voltaire. 

The 18th-century English Baroque composer Richard Carter composed and published an ode on the earthquake.

A fictionalised version of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake features as a main plot element of the 2014 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Rogue&quot;, developed and published by Ubisoft. Notably, a similar earthquake occurs earlier in the story in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and possibly coincides with a real-world earthquake recorded there in 1751.

The album &quot;1755&quot; by the Portuguese Gothic metal band Moonspell is a concept album detailing the story of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. The album is entirely sung in Portuguese and explores not only the history but also its effects on Portuguese society, culture and spirituality.

The Lisbon earthquake is vividly depicted in Avram Davidson&#x27;s &quot;Masters of the Maze&quot;, one of the many times and places visited by the book&#x27;s time-traveling protagonists.

The board game Lisboa was created in 2017 by Vital Lacerda and focuses on the reconstruction of Lisbon after the earthquake.

<text>In graph theory, an outerplanar graph is a graph that has a planar drawing for which all vertices belong to the outer face of the drawing.

Outerplanar graphs may be characterized (analogously to Wagner&#x27;s theorem for planar graphs) by the two forbidden minors and , or by their Colin de Verdière graph invariants.
They have Hamiltonian cycles if and only if they are biconnected, in which case the outer face forms the unique Hamiltonian cycle. Every outerplanar graph is 3-colorable, and has degeneracy and treewidth at most 2.

The outerplanar graphs are a subset of the planar graphs, the subgraphs of series–parallel graphs, and the circle graphs. The maximal outerplanar graphs, those to which no more edges can be added while preserving outerplanarity, are also chordal graphs and visibility graphs.

==History==
Outerplanar graphs were first studied and named by , in connection with the problem of determining the planarity of graphs formed by using a perfect matching to connect two copies of a base graph (for instance, many of the generalized Petersen graphs are formed in this way from two copies of a cycle graph). As they showed, when the base graph is biconnected, a graph constructed in this way is planar if and only if its base graph is outerplanar and the matching forms a dihedral permutation of its outer cycle. Chartrand and Harary also proved an analogue of Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem for outerplanar graphs, that a graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a subdivision of one of the two graphs &quot;K&quot;4 or &quot;K&quot;2,3.

==Definition and characterizations==
An outerplanar graph is an undirected graph that can be drawn in the plane without crossings in such a way that all of the vertices belong to the unbounded face of the drawing. That is, no vertex is totally surrounded by edges. Alternatively, a graph &quot;G&quot; is outerplanar if the graph formed from &quot;G&quot; by adding a new vertex, with edges connecting it to all the other vertices, is a planar graph.

A maximal outerplanar graph is an outerplanar graph that cannot have any additional edges added to it while preserving outerplanarity. Every maximal outerplanar graph with &quot;n&quot; vertices has exactly 2&quot;n&quot; − 3 edges, and every bounded face of a maximal outerplanar graph is a triangle.

===Forbidden graphs===
Outerplanar graphs have a forbidden graph characterization analogous to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem and Wagner&#x27;s theorem for planar graphs: a graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a subdivision of the complete graph &quot;K&quot;4 or the complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;2,3. Alternatively, a graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain &quot;K&quot;4 or &quot;K&quot;2,3 as a minor, a graph obtained from it by deleting and contracting edges.

A triangle-free graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a subdivision of &quot;K&quot;2,3.

===Colin de Verdière invariant===
A graph is outerplanar if and only if its Colin de Verdière graph invariant is at most two. The graphs characterized in a similar way by having Colin de Verdière invariant at most one, three, or four are respectively the linear forests, planar graphs, and
linklessly embeddable graphs.

==Properties==

===Biconnectivity and Hamiltonicity===
An outerplanar graph is biconnected if and only if the outer face of the graph forms a simple cycle without repeated vertices. An outerplanar graph is Hamiltonian if and only if it is biconnected; in this case, the outer face forms the unique Hamiltonian cycle. More generally, the size of the longest cycle in an outerplanar graph is the same as the number of vertices in its largest biconnected component. For this reason finding Hamiltonian cycles and longest cycles in outerplanar graphs may be solved in linear time, in contrast to the NP-completeness of these problems for arbitrary graphs.

Every maximal outerplanar graph satisfies a stronger condition than Hamiltonicity: it is node pancyclic, meaning that for every vertex &quot;v&quot; and every &quot;k&quot; in the range from three to the number of vertices in the graph, there is a length-&quot;k&quot; cycle containing &quot;v&quot;. A cycle of this length may be found by repeatedly removing a triangle that is connected to the rest of the graph by a single edge, such that the removed vertex is not &quot;v&quot;, until the outer face of the remaining graph has length &quot;k&quot;.

A planar graph is outerplanar if and only if each of its biconnected components is outerplanar.

===Coloring===
All loopless outerplanar graphs can be colored using only three colors; this fact features prominently in the simplified proof of Chvátal&#x27;s art gallery theorem by . A 3-coloring may be found in linear time by a greedy coloring algorithm that removes any vertex of degree at most two, colors the remaining graph recursively, and then adds back the removed vertex with a color different from the colors of its two neighbors.

According to Vizing&#x27;s theorem, the chromatic index of any graph (the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges so that no two adjacent edges have the same color) is either the maximum degree of any vertex of the graph or one plus the maximum degree. However, in a connected outerplanar graph, the chromatic index is equal to the maximum degree except when the graph forms a cycle of odd length. An edge coloring with an optimal number of colors can be found in linear time based on a breadth-first traversal of the weak dual tree.

===Other properties===
Outerplanar graphs have degeneracy at most two: every subgraph of an outerplanar graph contains a vertex with degree at most two.

Outerplanar graphs have treewidth at most two, which implies that many graph optimization problems that are NP-complete for arbitrary graphs may be solved in polynomial time by dynamic programming when the input is outerplanar. More generally, &quot;k&quot;-outerplanar graphs have treewidth O(&quot;k&quot;).

Every outerplanar graph can be represented as an intersection graph of axis-aligned rectangles in the plane, so outerplanar graphs have boxicity at most two.

==Related families of graphs==

Every outerplanar graph is a planar graph. Every outerplanar graph is also a subgraph of a series–parallel graph. However, not all planar series–parallel graphs are outerplanar. The complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;2,3 is planar and series–parallel but not outerplanar. On the other hand, the complete graph &quot;K&quot;4 is planar but neither series–parallel nor outerplanar. Every forest and every cactus graph are outerplanar.

The weak planar dual graph of an embedded outerplanar graph (the graph that has a vertex for every bounded face of the embedding, and an edge for every pair of adjacent bounded faces) is a forest, and the weak planar dual of a Halin graph is an outerplanar graph. A planar graph is outerplanar if and only if its weak dual is a forest, and it is Halin if and only if its weak dual is biconnected and outerplanar.

There is a notion of degree of outerplanarity. A 1-outerplanar embedding of a graph is the same as an outerplanar embedding. For &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1 a planar embedding is said to be &quot;k&quot;-outerplanar if removing the vertices on the outer face results in a (&quot;k&quot; − 1)-outerplanar embedding. 
A graph is &quot;k&quot;-outerplanar if it has a &quot;k&quot;-outerplanar embedding.

An outer-1-planar graph, analogously to 1-planar graphs can be drawn in a disk, with the vertices on the boundary of the disk, and with at most one crossing per edge.

Every maximal outerplanar graph is a chordal graph. Every maximal outerplanar graph is the visibility graph of a simple polygon. Maximal outerplanar graphs are also formed as the graphs of polygon triangulations. They are examples of 2-trees, of series–parallel graphs, and of chordal graphs.

Every outerplanar graph is a circle graph, the intersection graph of a set of chords of a circle.

<text>The Marble Arch is a 19th-century white marble-faced triumphal arch in London, England. The structure was designed by John Nash in 1827 as the state entrance to the cour d&#x27;honneur of Buckingham Palace; it stood near the site of what is today the three-bayed, central projection of the palace containing the well-known balcony. In 1851, on the initiative of architect and urban planner Decimus Burton, a one-time pupil of John Nash, the arch was relocated to its current site, near the northeast corner of Hyde Park, so that expansion of Buckingham Palace could proceed. 

The arch gives its name to the area surrounding it, particularly the southern portion of Edgware Road and also to the underground station. The arch is not part of the Royal Parks and is maintained by Westminster City Council.

==Design and construction==

Nash&#x27;s three-arch design is based on that of the Arch of Constantine in Rome and the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris. The triumphal arch is faced with Carrara marble with embellishments of marble extracted from quarries near Seravezza in Tuscany.
John Flaxman was chosen to make the commemorative sculpture. After his death in 1826, the commission was divided between Sir Richard Westmacott, Edward Hodges Baily and J. C. F. Rossi. In 1829, a bronze equestrian statue of George IV was commissioned from Sir Francis Chantrey, with the intention of placing it on top of the arch.

Construction began in 1827, but was cut short in 1830, following the death of the spendthrift King George IV – the rising costs were unacceptable to the new king, William IV, who later tried to offload the uncompleted palace onto Parliament as a substitute for the recently destroyed Palace of Westminster.

Work restarted in 1832, this time under the supervision of Edward Blore, who greatly reduced Nash&#x27;s planned attic stage and omitted its sculpture, including the statue of George IV. The arch was completed in 1833.

Some of the unused sculpture, including parts of Westmacott&#x27;s frieze of Waterloo and the Nelson panels, were used at Buckingham Palace. His victory statues and Rossi&#x27;s relief of Europe and Asia were used at the National Gallery. In 1843 the equestrian statue of George IV was installed on one of the pedestals in Trafalgar Square.

The white marble soon lost its light colouring in the polluted London atmosphere. In 1847, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s London Magazine&quot; described it as &quot;discoloured by smoke and damp, and in appearance resembling a huge sugar erection in a confectioner&#x27;s shop window.&quot;

The arch is high, and measures east-west by north–south.

==Relocation==
Buckingham Palace remained unoccupied, and for the most part unfinished, until it was hurriedly completed upon the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837. Within a few years, it was deemed that the palace was too small to accommodate the large court and the Queen&#x27;s expanding family. The solution was to enlarge the palace by enclosing the cour d&#x27;honneur with a new east range. This façade is today the principal front and public face of the palace and shields the inner façades containing friezes and marbles matching and complementing those of the arch.

When building work began in 1847, the arch was dismantled and rebuilt by Thomas Cubitt as a ceremonial entrance to the northeast corner of Hyde Park at Cumberland Gate. The reconstruction was completed in March 1851. A popular story says that the arch was moved because it was too narrow for the Queen&#x27;s state coach to pass through, but, in fact, the Gold State Coach passed under it during Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation in 1953.

Three small rooms inside the rebuilt arch were used as a police station from 1851 until at least 1968 (John Betjeman made a television programme inside it in 1968 and referred to it as a fully functional police station). It firstly housed officers of the Royal Parks Constabulary and later the Metropolitan Police. One policeman stationed there during the early 1860s was Samuel Parkes, who won the Victoria Cross in the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854, during the Crimean War.

==Park Lane widening==
Park Lane was widened as part of the Park Lane Improvement Scheme of the London County Council, and the Marble Arch became stranded on a traffic island. The scheme required an act of Parliament – the Park Lane Improvement Act 1958 (6 &amp; 7 Eliz. 2. c. 63) – and during the passage of this act the possibility of providing an underpass instead of a roundabout was dismissed due to excessive cost and the need to demolish buildings on Edgware Road. As part of the scheme, gardens were laid out around the arch on the traffic island. The works took place between 1960 and 1964.

&quot;Still Water&quot;, a large bronze sculpture of a horse&#x27;s head by Nic Fiddian-Green, was unveiled on the same traffic island a short distance from the arch in 2011.

In 2005 it was speculated that the arch might be moved across the street to Hyde Park, or to a more accessible location than its position on what was then a large traffic island.

== Marble Arch area ==

In 1900, the Central London Railway opened Marble Arch tube station across the road from the arch. The station is now on the Central line of the London Underground.

Having a tube station means that the arch gives rise to a colloquial, entirely modern London &quot;area&quot;, with no parishes or established institutions bearing its name. This generally equates to parts in view of the arch of Mayfair, Marylebone and often all of St George&#x27;s Fields, Marylebone (west of Edgware Road) all in the City of Westminster, London, W1H.

The area around the arch forms a major road junction connecting Oxford Street to the east, Park Lane (A4202) to the south, Bayswater Road (A402) to the west, and Edgware Road (A5) to the north-west. The short road directly to the north of the arch is also known as Marble Arch.

The former cinema Odeon Marble Arch was located directly adjacent to the junction. Before 1997 this had the largest cinema screen in London. The screen was originally over wide. The Odeon showcased 70 mm films in a large circle-and-stalls auditorium. It closed in 2016 and was demolished later that same year.

The arch also stands close to the former site of the Tyburn gallows (sometimes called &quot;Tyburn Tree&quot;), a place of public execution from 1388 until 1793.

In 2021 the Marble Arch Mound, a temporary viewing platform, was opened at the site.

<text>Fonio, also sometimes called findi or acha, is the term for two cultivated grasses in the genus &quot;Digitaria&quot; that are important crops in parts of West Africa. It is a vital food source in many rural areas, especially in the mountains of Fouta Djalon, Guinea, but it is also cultivated in Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Senegal. The global fonio market was estimated at 721,400 tonnes in 2020. Guinea annually produces the most fonio in the world, accounting for over 75% of the world&#x27;s production in 2019. The name &quot;fonio&quot; (borrowed into English from French) is from Wolof &quot;foño&quot;. In West Africa, the species black fonio &quot;(Digitaria iburua)&quot; and white fonio &quot;(Digitaria exilis)&quot; are cultivated; the latter is the economically more important crop.

Fonio is a glumaceous monocot belonging to the grass family Poaceae and the genus Digitaria. While hundreds of these crabgrass species exist, only a few of them are produced for their grains. It is a small annual herbaceous plant with an inflorescence containing two or three racemes. The racemes have spikelets grouped in twos, threes, or fours, with a sterile and a fertile flower producing the fonio grain. Fonio has a short growing season and is well adjusted to harsh environments. The size of its root system, which can extend down to more than one meter in depth, is advantageous in periods of drought and helps with its adaptation to poor soils. Once considered a humble and often overlooked grain commonly known as the &quot;cereal of the poor,&quot; fonio is now gaining attention in urban West Africa. Its unique cooking properties and nutritional benefits are sparking renewed interest in this once underrated staple.


==Types==
===White fonio===
White fonio, &quot;Digitaria exilis&quot;, also called &quot;hungry rice&quot; by Europeans, is the most common of a diverse group of wild and domesticated &quot;Digitaria&quot; species that are harvested in the savannas of West Africa. Fonio has the smallest seeds of all species of millet. It has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development, and support sustainable use of the land.

Nutritious, gluten-free, and high in dietary fiber, fonio is one of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing cereals, reaching maturity in as little as six to eight weeks. The grains are used to make porridge, couscous, bread, and beer.

===Black fonio===
Black fonio, &quot;D. iburua&quot;, also known as iburu, is a similar crop grown in several countries of West Africa, particularly Nigeria, Togo, and Benin. Like white fonio, it is nutritious, fast-growing, and has the benefit of maturing before other grains, allowing for harvest during the &quot;hungry season.&quot; However, it contains considerably more protein compared to &quot;D. exilis.&quot;

Black fonio is mostly cultivated in rural communities and is rarely sold commercially, even in West African cities.

== Cultivation and processing ==
===Climate and attributes===

Fonio is cultivated in all West Africa as a staple crop. Guinea is the biggest producer of fonio with a production of and a cultivated surface area of in 2021, followed by Nigeria () and Mali (). 

Fonio grows in dry climates without irrigation, and is unlikely to be a successful crop in humid regions. It is planted in light (sandy to stony) soils, and will grow in poor soil. Fonio is cultivated at sea level in Gambia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, but it is otherwise mostly cultivated in altitudes ranging between . The growth cycle ranges from 70–130 days, depending on variety. It is mostly grown in areas with an average annual rainfall of .

Fonio plants are medium in height. Indeed, &quot;D. exilis&quot; can reach a height of , and &quot;D. iburua&quot; a height of . The ploidy level for the species ranges from diploid (2n), tetraploid (4n), to hexaploid (6n). Like many other grasses, fonio has a C4 carbon fixation, which makes it drought tolerant.

===Ploughing and sowing===
The ploughing is done by the men by hand, animal traction or with tractors. The sowing is generally done by hand by the women, depending on the onset of the rainy season. The fonio plant grows quickly; some landrace reach maturity in 8 weeks. It is, however, a weak weed competitor at the beginning of its growth, so weeding is important in the first development stages.

===Harvest===
Fonio is labor-intensive to harvest and process. In some regions, the mature fonio plants are uprooted, but the most common method is to cut the straws with knives and sickles which often leads to wounds on the hands. Women then gather the sheaves into cylindrical stacks or horizontal beams to store the sheaves and allow them to dry before the threshing without overheating. The threshing is then done by trampling on the plants or by beating the plants with rigid rods or more flexible sticks

The fonio plants are prone to lodging in the soil, which makes potential mechanization of the harvest processes difficult.

===Dehusking===

After the threshing, the fonio grains are still in their husk and the small grains make husk removal difficult and time-consuming. Traditional methods include pounding it in a mortar with sand, and then separating the grains and sand, or &quot;popping&quot; it over a flame and then pounding it, which yields a toasted-color grain (a technique used among the Akposso). The invention of a simple fonio husking machine offers an easier mechanical way to dehusk.

=== Gender role ===

Gender role plays a big part in the cultivation of fonio; tasks are distributed differently between men and women. Women do the weeding, the threshing by trampling, the cleaning as well as the drying and processing, while men do the harvest and the threshing by beating. Women&#x27;s role is predominant in fonio&#x27;s production. Half of the cultivation&#x27;s tasks are exclusively done by women, against 14% for men. The tasks assigned to women require patience and meticulousness, while those assigned to men call for strength.

=== Effect of processing methods on nutrient value ===
Before consumption, fonio grains must be processed using mechanical (dehusking, milling) or thermal (precooking, parboiling, roasting) methods. Depending on the processing method, the nutrient value may be affected.

Regarding the macronutrients, the carbohydrate content remains higher when the grains are precooked rather than roasted. The protein content is much lower after milling because the bran that gets removed contains a lot of protein. The highest protein content is achieved when parboiling. The lipid content is increased when roasted and decreased when milled or precooked.

Regarding micronutrients, the iron and zinc content remains the highest when parboiled while milling leads to a loss due to the removal of the bran. Phytate, an anti-nutritional factor that inhibits the absorption of minerals like iron and zinc, is reduced by washing and cooking but is still high enough to inhibit adequate mineral absorption.

Generally, parboiled fonio shows the best nutritional composition when compared to the other processing methods. However, parboiling fonio does not lead to as efficient redistribution of nutrients as is the case with parboiled rice. Additionally, the process of parboiling changes the color of the fonio grains which is disliked by some consumers.

== Commercialization outside of Africa ==

Fonio has been relatively unknown outside the African continent until recently, when companies in Europe and the United States began to import the grain from West Africa, often citing its ecological and nutritional benefits in their marketing.

=== United States ===
In the United States, Yolélé Foods, led by Senegalese-American chef Pierre Thiam, started importing and selling fonio in 2017. Thiam hopes to introduce Americans to the grain while simultaneously supporting sustainable and traditional agriculture in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali and Senegal. What is considered to be a peasant&#x27;s food in West Africa is now sold in luxury grocery stores in the United States.

However, Thiam positions his project as part of a larger movement to elevate the economic power of African farmers, who for centuries have been suppressed by Western hegemony in the global food system.

=== European Union ===
In December 2018, the European Commission approved commercialization of fonio as a novel food in the European Union, after submission by the Italian company Obà Food to manufacture and market new food products. These products include fonio pasta, revealing a desire to change fonio to be more recognizable to the European palate.

Since this initial approval, fonio has gradually become more popular and more accessible in Europe. By 2021, the EU was importing 422 metric tonnes (465.2 tons) of fonio, a significant increase from the 172 metric tonnes (189.6 tons) imported in 2016.

<doc id="352353" wikidata="Q207988" url="?curid=352353" title="Spirit level">
<text>A spirit level, bubble level, or simply a level, is an instrument designed to indicate whether a surface is horizontal (level) or vertical (plumb). 
Two basic designs exist: &quot;tubular&quot; (or &quot;linear&quot;) and &quot;bull&#x27;s eye&quot; (or &quot;circular&quot;).
Different types of spirit levels may be used by carpenters, stonemasons, bricklayers, other building trades workers, surveyors, millwrights and other metalworkers, and in some photographic or videographic work.

==History==

The history of the spirit level was discussed in brief in an 1887 article appearing in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Melchisédech Thévenot, a French scientist, invented the instrument some time before February 2, 1661. This date can be established from Thevenot&#x27;s correspondence with scientist Christiaan Huygens. Within a year of this date the inventor circulated details of his invention to others, including Robert Hooke in London and Vincenzo Viviani in Florence. It is occasionally argued that these &quot;bubble levels&quot; did not come into widespread use until the beginning of the the earliest surviving examples being from that but Adrien Auzout had recommended that the Académie Royale des Sciences take &quot;levels of the Thevenot type&quot; on its expedition to Madagascar in 1666. It is very likely that these levels were in use in France and elsewhere long before the turn of the century.

The Fell All-Way precision level, one of the first successful American made bull&#x27;s eye levels for machine tool use, was invented by William B. Fell of Rockford, Illinois in 1939. The device was unique in that it could be placed on a machine bed and show tilt on the x-y axes simultaneously, eliminating the need to rotate the level 90 degrees. The level was so accurate it was restricted from export during World War II. The device set a new standard of .0005 inches per foot resolution (five ten thousands per foot or five arc seconds tilt). Production of the level stopped around 1970, and was restarted in the 1980s by Thomas Butler Technology, also of Rockford, Illinois, but finally ended in the mid-1990s. However, there are still hundreds of the devices in existence.

==Design and construction==
Early tubular spirit levels had very slightly curved glass vials with constant inner diameter at each viewing point. These vials are filled, incompletely, with a usually a colored spirit or leaving a bubble in the tube. They have a slight upward curve, so that the bubble naturally rests in the center, the highest point. At slight inclinations the bubble travels away from the marked center position. Where a spirit level must also be usable upside-down or on its side, the curved constant-diameter tube is replaced by an uncurved barrel-shaped tube with a slightly larger diameter in its middle.

Alcohols such as ethanol are often used rather than water. Alcohols have low viscosity and surface tension, which allows the bubble to travel the tube quickly and settle accurately with minimal interference from the glass surface. Alcohols also have a much wider liquid temperature range, and will not break the vial as water could due to ice expansion. A colorant such as fluorescein, typically yellow or green, may be added to increase the visibility of the bubble.

A variant of the linear spirit level is the bull&#x27;s eye level: a circular, flat-bottomed device with the liquid under a slightly glass face with a circle at the center. It serves to level a surface across a plane, while the tubular level only does so in the direction of the tube.

== Calibration ==
To check the accuracy of a carpenter&#x27;s type level, a perfectly horizontal surface is not needed. The level is placed on a flat and roughly level surface and the reading on the bubble tube is noted. This reading indicates to what extent the surface is parallel to the horizontal plane, according to the level, which at this stage is of unknown accuracy. The spirit level is then rotated through 180 degrees in the horizontal plane, and another reading is noted. If the level is accurate, it will indicate the same orientation with respect to the horizontal plane. A difference implies that the level is inaccurate.

Adjustment of the spirit level is performed by successively rotating the level and moving the bubble tube within its housing to take up roughly half of the discrepancy, until the magnitude of the reading remains constant when the level is flipped.

A similar procedure is applied to more sophisticated instruments such as a surveyor&#x27;s optical level or a theodolite and is a matter of course each time the instrument is set up. In this latter case, the plane of rotation of the instrument is levelled, along with the spirit level. This is done in two horizontal perpendicular directions.

==Sensitivity==
Sensitivity is an important specification for a spirit level, as the device&#x27;s accuracy depends on its sensitivity. The sensitivity of a level is given as the change of angle or gradient required to move the bubble by unit distance. If the bubble housing has graduated divisions, then the sensitivity is the angle or gradient change that moves the bubble by one of these divisions. is the usual spacing for graduations; on a surveyor&#x27;s level, the bubble will move when the vial is tilted about 0.005 degree. For a precision machinist level with divisions, when the vial is tilted one division, the level will change one meter from the pivot point, referred to by machinists as 5 tenths per foot. This terminology is unique to machinists and indicates a length of 5 tenths &quot;of&quot; 1 thousandth of an inch.

==Types==
There are different types of spirit levels for different uses:
*Carpenter&#x27;s level (either wood, aluminium or composite materials)
*Mason&#x27;s level
*Torpedo level 
*Post level
*Line level
*Engineer&#x27;s precision level
*Electronic level
*Inclinometer
*Slip or Skid Indicator
* Bull&#x27;s eye level

A spirit level is usually found on the head of combination squares.

===Carpenter&#x27;s level===
A traditional carpenter&#x27;s spirit level looks like a short plank of wood and often has a wide body to ensure stability, and that the surface is being measured correctly. In the middle of the spirit level is a small window where the bubble and the tube is mounted. Two notches (or rings) designate where the bubble should be if the surface is level. Often an indicator for a 45 degree inclination is included.

===Line level===
A line level is a level designed to hang on a builder&#x27;s string line. The body of the level incorporates small hooks to allow it to attach and hang from the string line. The body is lightweight, so as not to weigh down the string line, it is also small in size as the string line in effect becomes the body; when the level is hung in the center of the string, each &#x27;leg&#x27; of the string line extends the level&#x27;s plane.

===Engineer&#x27;s precision levels===

An engineer&#x27;s precision level permits leveling items to greater accuracy than a plain spirit level. They are used to level the foundations, or beds of machines to ensure the machine can output workpieces to the accuracy pre-built in the machine.

==Surveyor&#x27;s leveling instrument==

Combining a spirit level with an optical telescope results in a &quot;tilting level&quot; or &quot;dumpy level&quot;. These leveling instruments as used in surveying to measure height differences over larger distances. A surveyor&#x27;s leveling instrument has a spirit level mounted on a telescope (perhaps 30 power) with cross-hairs, itself mounted on a tripod. The observer reads height values off two graduated vertical rods, one &#x27;behind&#x27; and one &#x27;in front&#x27;, to obtain the height difference between the ground points on which the rods are resting. Starting from a point with a known elevation and going cross country (successive points being perhaps apart) height differences can be measured cumulatively over long distances and elevations can be calculated. Precise levelling is supposed to give the difference in elevation between two points apart correct to within a few millimeters.

== Alternatives ==
Alternatives include:

* Reed level
* Laser line level
* Water level

Today level tools are available in most smartphones by using the device&#x27;s accelerometer. These mobile apps come with various features and easy designs. Also new web standards allow websites to get orientation of devices.

Digital spirit levels are increasingly common in replacing conventional spirit levels, particularly in civil engineering applications such as traditional building construction and steel structure erection, for on-site angle alignment and leveling tasks. The industry practitioners often refer to those levelling tools as a &quot;construction level&quot;, &quot;heavy duty level&quot;, &quot;inclinometer&quot;, or &quot;protractor&quot;. These modern electronic levels are capable of displaying precise numeric angles within 360° with 0.1° to 0.05° accuracy, can be read from a distance with clarity, and are affordably priced due to mass adoption. They provide features that traditional levels are unable to match. Typically, these features enable steel beam frames under construction to be precisely aligned and levelled to the required orientation, which is vital to ensure the stability, strength and rigidity of steel structures on sites. Digital levels, embedded with angular MEMS technology effectively improve productivity and quality of many modern civil structures. Some recent models feature waterproof IP65 and impact resistance features for harsh working environments.

<doc id="352354" wikidata="Q2564634" url="?curid=352354" title="Limit state design">
<text>Limit State Design (LSD), also known as Load And Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), refers to a design method used in structural engineering. A limit state is a condition of a structure beyond which it no longer fulfills the relevant design criteria. The condition may refer to a degree of loading or other actions on the structure, while the criteria refer to structural integrity, fitness for use, durability or other design requirements. A structure designed by LSD is proportioned to sustain all actions likely to occur during its design life, and to remain fit for use, with an appropriate level of reliability for each limit state. Building codes based on LSD implicitly define the appropriate levels of reliability by their prescriptions.

The method of limit state design, developed in the USSR and based on research led by Professor N.S. Streletski, was introduced in USSR building regulations in 1955.

==Criteria==
Limit state design requires the structure to satisfy two principal criteria: the ultimate limit state (ULS) and the serviceability limit state (SLS).

Any design process involves a number of assumptions. First: the loads to which a structure will be subjected 2: foreseeable or cognizable possible exceptional scenarios and the stresses these may impress, and 3) the individual and collective strengths pertaining to any constituent part or sum of parts as a group and as a whole.

==Ultimate limit state (ULS)==
A clear distinction is made between the ultimate state (US) and the ultimate limit state (ULS). The Ultimate State is a physical situation that involves either excessive deformations sufficient to cause collapse of the component under consideration or the structure as a whole, or deformations exceeding values considered to be the acceptable tolerance. 

A structure is deemed to satisfy the ultimate limit based upon arbitrary criteria, per the nominal, not physical, intentions or goals set forth by human actors, and that, as such, have nothing to do with engineering strictly speaking, but instead exist &quot;on paper&quot; to conceal, distort, or otherwise obfuscate the true fundamental behaviors applicable to a structure.

Complying with the design criteria of the ULS is not sufficient to perform the minimum requisite steps necessary for proper structural safety.

==Serviceability limit state (SLS)==
In addition to the ULS check mentioned above, a Service Limit State (SLS) computational check must be performed. To satisfy the serviceability limit state criterion, a structure must remain functional for the duration of its intended use subject to routine (everyday) loading.
==Factor development==
The load and resistance factors are determined using statistics and a pre-selected probability of failure. Variability in the quality of construction, consistency of the construction material are accounted for in the factors. Generally, a factor of unity (one) or less is applied to the resistances of the material, and a factor of unity or greater to the loads. Not often used, but in some load cases a factor may be less than unity due to a reduced probability of the combined loads. 

The aforementioned factors can differ for different materials or even between differing grades of the same material. For example, wood has larger factor of variability than steel. The factors applied to resistance also account for the degree of scientific confidence in the derivation of the values.

In determining the specific magnitude of the factors, more deterministic loads (e.g., dead load - the weight of the structure and permanent attachments like walls, floor treatments, ceiling finishes) are given lower factors (for example 1.4) than highly variable loads like earthquake, wind, or live (occupancy) loads (1.6). Impact loads are typically given higher factors still (say 2.0) in order to account for both their unpredictable magnitudes and the dynamic nature of the loading vs. the static nature of most models. 

Limit states design has the potential to produce a more consistently designed structure as each element is intended to have the same probability of failure. In practical terms this normally results in a more efficient structure, and as such, it can be argued that LSD is superior from a practical engineering viewpoint.

==Example treatment of LSD in building codes==
The following is the treatment of LSD found in the National Building Code of Canada:

 NBCC 1995 Format
 φR &gt; αDD + ψ γ {αLL + αQQ + αTT}

 where φ = Resistance Factor
 ψ = Load Combination Factor
 γ = Importance Factor
 αD = Dead Load Factor
 αL = Live Load Factor
 αQ = Earthquake Load Factor
 αT = Thermal Effect (Temperature) Load Factor

Limit state design has replaced the older concept of permissible stress design in most forms of civil engineering. A notable exception is transportation engineering. Even so, new codes are currently being developed for both geotechnical and transportation engineering which are LSD based. As a result, most modern buildings are designed in accordance with a code which is based on limit state theory. For example, in Europe, structures are designed to conform with the Eurocodes: Steel structures are designed in accordance with EN 1993, and reinforced concrete structures to EN 1992. Australia, Canada, China, France, Indonesia, and New Zealand (among many others) utilise limit state theory in the development of their design codes. In the purest sense, it is now considered inappropriate to discuss safety factors when working with LSD, as there are concerns that this may lead to confusion. Previously, it has been shown that the LRFD and ASD can produce significantly different designs of steel gable frames.

There are few situations where ASD produces significantly lighter weight steel gable frame designs. Additionally, it has been shown that in high snow regions, the difference between the methods is more dramatic.

==In the United States==
The United States has been particularly slow to adopt limit state design (known as Load and Resistance Factor Design in the US). Design codes and standards are issued by diverse organizations, some of which have adopted limit state design, and others have not.

The ACI 318 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete uses Limit State design.

The ANSI/AISC 360 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, the ANSI/AISI S-100 North American Specification for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members, and The Aluminum Association&#x27;s Aluminum Design Manual contain two methods of design side by side: 
# Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), a Limit States Design implementation, and
# Allowable Strength Design (ASD), a method where the nominal strength is divided by a safety factor to determine the allowable strength. This allowable strength is required to equal or exceed the required strength for a set of ASD load combinations. ASD is calibrated to give the same structural reliability and component size as the LRFD method with a live to dead load ratio of 3. Consequently, when structures have a live to dead load ratio that differs from 3, ASD produces designs that are either less reliable or less efficient as compared to designs resulting from the LRFD method.

In contrast, the ANSI/AWWA D100 Welded Carbon Steel Tanks for Water Storage and API 650 Welded Tanks for Oil Storage still use allowable stress design.

==In Europe==
In Europe, the limit state design is enforced by the Eurocodes.

<doc id="352365" wikidata="Q939139" url="?curid=352365" title="Poison the Well (band)">
<text>Poison the Well is an American metalcore band from Miami, Florida who were originally active between 1997 and 2010. Lead guitarist Ryan Primack and drummer Chris Hornbrook are the only remaining founding members (though both left for various stints in the late 1990s), with long-serving vocalist Jeffrey Moreira being featured on all five of their studio albums. The band reformed for numerous shows in 2015, and again in both 2016 and 2020; they have since reunited permanently and are working on a new album as of 2024. Their albums have sold a combined total of over 300,000 copies in the United States as of 2012.

==History==

=== Formation: Doubting Thomas to An Acre Lost (1997–1998) ===
Poison the Well was originally formed under the name &lt;bdi&gt;Doubting Thomas&lt;/bdi&gt; by lead vocalist Aryeh Lehrer and lead guitarist Ryan Primack in the autumn of 1997. Lehrer was responsible for coining the name Doubting Thomas. The band was originally based in Coral Springs, Florida, where the two attended J. P. Taravella High School, but later moved to a rehearsal space in Miami, Florida. Lehrer, who had previously played in the band Reaching Out, recruited rhythm guitarist Russel Saunders, formerly of the band Side Order, and bassist Shane Halpern who had recently moved from North Carolina down to Florida.

In December 1997, Doubting Thomas was renamed An Acre Lost, a name Saunders&#x27; girlfriend came up with.

=== &quot;The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation&quot; (1999–2001) ===
From October 2–10, 1999, Poison the Well recorded their first full-length album, &quot;The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation&quot;, with producer Jeremy Staska at Studio 13. The band invited former vocalists Hosein and Lehrer to provide backing vocals on the song &quot;Not Within Arms Length&quot;, the lyrics of which had been written by Hosein before he left the band in 1998.

Bassist Landsman was kicked out of the band in late September 2000 due to ongoing personal differences. Landsman had been the vocalist in the Florida metalcore band Until the End and would later front the band Target Nevada with several ex-Poison the Well members. Nevertheless, Landsman agreed to honour Poison the Well&#x27;s already-booked upcoming show on October 6, 2000, at Club Q in Davie, Florida. The show was a landmark event, not only as Landsman&#x27;s final show with Poison the Well, but because it also celebrated the release of Until the End&#x27;s debut extended play, already released on September 12, 2000, through Equal Vision Records. Despite rumors that he walking off stage mid-way through their show, Landsman finished Poison the Well&#x27;s set and went on to perform with Until the End later that evening. However, Hornbrook was later asked to leave Until the End at Landsman&#x27;s insistence.

Michael Gordillo was immediately announced as Landsman&#x27;s replacement. Gordillo&#x27;s first show with Poison the Well was on October 20, 2000, at the Downtime in Manhattan, New York.

Poison the Well continued touring for most of 2001 in promotion of &quot;The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation&quot;. They performed at the Board Festival in Boston, Massachusetts, Hellfest in East Syracuse, New York, Monster Fest in Burlington, Vermont and Krazy Fest 4 in Louisville, Kentucky 

In February 2001, Gordillo departed; a month later he was replaced by California-based bassist Javier Van Huss, formerly of the bands Enewetak, Eighteen Visions, Throwdown, Breakneck, Bleeding Through and Wrench. From mid-March to mid-April 2001, Poison the Well toured with Candiria, Origin and Cryptopsy.

Bassist Iano Dovi, formerly of the band Pintsize, joined in August 2001, just in time for a two-week tour with Unearth, God Forbid and Martyr AD across Canada, the Northeast and the Midwest.

=== Unreleased splits and &quot;Distance Makes the Heart Grow Fonder&quot; reissue (2000–2002) ===
In August 2000, Poison the Well announced that a split 7-inch vinyl was in development for release through a one-off deal with Pennsylvania-based record label Surprise Attack Records and Georgia-based record label Jawk Records. The band sharing the split was originally meant to be their touring mates Twelve Tribes and Poison the Well recorded two exclusive songs in early October 2000: &quot;Sticks and Stones Never Made Sense&quot; and a cover of The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Today&quot;. These were the band&#x27;s first recordings played in Drop C tuning and to feature their new bassist Mike Gordillo. By November 2000, the split, which had been scheduled for release in December 2000, had been pushed back to late January–early February 2001 and Twelve Tribes was replaced by Florida-based band A New Kind of American Saint. Poison the Well had been touring with A New Kind of American Saint&#x27;s guitarist Michael Peters the month prior.

The second release with Undecided Records was to be another split 7-inch, this one with Eighteen Visions. The split for Undecided Records was to feature a Metallica cover from each of the bands as part of the record label&#x27;s &quot;Crush &#x27;Em All&quot; series, which had already seen a split by Shai Hulud and BoySetsFire released as Volume 1 in March 2000. The series was also planning other splits for Indecision and Walls of Jericho (Volume 2), Today Is the Day and Supermachiner (Volume 4) and Disembodied (Volume 5); Poison the Well and Eighteen Visions were to be the third release in the series with a tentative release date for the summer of 2001. In January 2001, the &quot;Crush &#x27;Em All&quot; series switched from 7-inch vinyl to compact discs. Poison the Well planned to record a cover of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, but due to complications with Trustkill Records, were unable to record it and their split with Eighteen Visions was shelved.

Poison the Well&#x27;s split for Surprise Attack Records and Jawk Records was also going through delays. Although both Poison the Well and A New Kind of American Saint had recorded their songs, Trustkill Records was unhappy that Poison the Well would be releasing new and original material on another record label. Trustkill Records originally wanted both songs, &quot;Sticks and Stones Never Made Sense&quot; and their cover of The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Today&quot;, to appear on their forthcoming sophomore full-length (which later took shape as &quot;Tear from the Red&quot;). On February 11, 2001, it was announced that an agreement had been struck with Trustkill Records but that it could not be released until after Poison the Well&#x27;s new album was out (i.e. not until later in 2002), leading A New Kind of American Saint to drop off the project.

Only week later, on February 18, 2001, it was reported that Throwdown, which featured members of Eighteen Visions, would replace A New Kind of American Saint on the split 7-inch vinyl. Throwdown immediately planned to enter the studio to record two new songs: &quot;False Idols&quot; and a cover of Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;. But Throwdown&#x27;s recording session was pushed back by several months due to their touring schedule. In March 2001, Surprise Attack Records used the recording of &quot;Sticks and Stones Never Made Sense&quot; on their Various Artists sampler &quot;Budget Sampler:&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Money&quot;, co-released with Canadian record labels Goodfellow Records and Redstar Records. Poison the Well then performed their cover of &quot;Today&quot; at Hellfest 2001 on Friday, July 6, 2001, at Liquids in East Syracuse, New York. Throwdown finally entered the studio to record their side of the split in mid-August 2001; by this time, their choice cover had changed to Deftones&#x27; &quot;Around the Fur&quot;.

&quot;Sticks and Stones Never Made Sense&quot; was eventually re-recorded for Poison the Well&#x27;s sophomore full-length &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; in October–November 2001. Throwdown&#x27;s original song &quot;False Idols&quot; was also later re-recorded for their full-length album &quot;Haymaker&quot;. Jawk Records announced that the artwork for the split was designed in October 2001, and in January 2002 the test presses of the 7-inch vinyl had been received. Nevertheless, the release was ultimately shelved. The original recording of &quot;Sticks and Stones Never Made Sense&quot; was later used as a bonus track on the Japanese version of &quot;You Come Before You&quot;, released by Warner Music Japan on October 29, 2003, and appeared on the b-side to the 10-inch vinyl single for &quot;Ghostchant&quot; (both listed it as &quot;Sticks and Stones Never Made Sense (Demo)&quot;. The band later posted it on their Myspace page on October 10, 2006. Poison the Well&#x27;s cover of &quot;Today&quot; was never released; the band later recorded another The Smashing Pumpkins cover, &quot;Soma&quot; for the ReIgnition Recordings Various Artists compilation &quot;The Killer in You: A Tribute to Smashing Pumpkins&quot;.

=== &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; (2001–2002) ===
Poison the Well had originally planned to record their sophomore album in April 2001, after returning from a booked Asian tour, with a scheduled release date of August 1, 2001. At that time, the release was to be made up of eleven original songs and a cover song. The cover song was quickly dropped and the band announced that they would instead track twelve original songs. Once the Asian tour was cancelled, the band took the opportunity to spend more time writing the album and opted to tour North America during the spring and summer of 2001. &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; was written over a period of one year, from the summer of 2000 to the summer of 2001, during which time the band played with five different bassist. Landsman, Gordillo, Van Huss, Albert and Dovi each contributed to the songwriting and arrangements.

Jacob Bannon was originally consulted to design the artwork for &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; but the band instead hired Demon Hunter bassist Don Clark at Asterik Studio. The compact disc edition booklet was designed to include a semi-transparent parchment paper after every page. Poison the Well planned to release &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; on Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14, 2002. However, the date fell on a Thursday and Trustkill Records was forced to work with music industry standards of releasing new music on Tuesdays. The date was therefore set for the first Tuesday after Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 19, 2002. Trustkill Records began accepting pre-orders on February 8, 2002, and any orders placed prior to the release date included a free 18&quot; by 24&quot; poster.

Poison the Well then reunited with Hatebreed for the Perseverance Tour 2002 which took the bands through the Midwest and West Coast from February 28 to March 19, 2002. They were accompanied by Bane and What Feeds the Fire on all dates and Hemlock for one of the legs; Bane, however, had to pull out towards the end of the tour when their close friend Steve Neale passed away. It was while Poison the Well was on this tour that &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; blew up in the media. The album entered &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s charts on March 9, 2002, reaching number 23 on the Independent Albums chart and number 36 on the Heatseekers Albums charts. &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; also entered &quot;CMJ&quot;&#x27;s charts, topping the Most Added chart, reaching number 1 on the Loud Rock College chart, number 4 on the Radio 200 and Loud Rock Crucial Spin charts and number 22 on the Retail 100 chart. The band immediately began to be courted by major record labels, much to the dissatisfaction of Trustkill Records, who attempted to renew their soon-expiring contract. Nevertheless, Poison the Well ended up signing with Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group, which was operating as an independent imprint with secured financing through Atlantic Records.

Poison the Well welcomed new bassist Geoffrey Bergman, formerly of Curl Up and Die, in mid-May 2002, but he did not officially take up the position until June 1, 2002, when the band embarked on a tour with Strung Out, Rise Against and Rufio The bands hit the road from June 1–29, 2002 playing in the South, East Coast, Midwest and West Coast. From July 9 to August 9, 2002, Poison the Well toured across the entire United States supporting Kittie, Shadows Fall and Killswitch Engage. Due to van troubles upon leaving Florida, however, Poison the Well missed the first two shows of the tour; Killswitch Engage also missed the first couple of dates because of their performance at Hellfest.

On August 27, 2002, Poison the Well played a surprise show at Kaffe Krystal in Miami, Florida, disguised under the name Tear from the Red on the bill. The event highlighting local Florida hardcore band Destro&#x27;s final show, but also celebrated the release of Poison the Well&#x27;s &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; 7-inch vinyl singles on Trustkill Records and the band&#x27;s first DVD &quot;Tear from the Road&quot;. The DVD included a documentary and live footage of the band on their recent tours promoting &quot;Tear from the Red&quot;, along with the music video for &quot;Botchla&quot; and a making-of the video feature. The DVD was edited by Christopher Sims through his film production company TimeCode Entertainment, and was marketed through Trustkill Records and Velvet Hammer&#x27;s promotional division Streetwise Concepts &amp; Culture.

===&quot;You Come Before You&quot; and abandoned album (2002–2005)===
The success of &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; and their continuous touring schedule helped Poison The Well gain the attention of some major labels, which had started to take interest in bands coming from the hardcore scene. The band signed with Atlantic Records in 2002 and started writing for their third studio album, &quot;You Come Before You&quot;.

Poison the Well wanted to continue the evolution of their sound and felt that they needed a team of people who understood where they were going and what they wanted to do. They recorded with Swedish producers Pelle Henricsson and Eskil Lövström. Both had worked on many influential mid to late nineties Swedish hardcore records, including Refused&#x27;s &quot;Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent&quot; and &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot;. The band first recorded in Van Nuys, California at Sound City Studios and completed the rest at Tonteknik Recording AB in Umeå, Sweden. After the record was complete, the band started a year and a half tour cycle that took them to Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Towards the end, many of the band members were worn out and unsure if they wanted to continue with Poison the Well.

Having experienced some level of success with their previous record, &quot;You Come Before You&quot;, a long and hard touring cycle left certain members of the band disenchanted. In the summer of 2004, guitarist Derek Miller quit the band. Miller had been in Poison the Well for all three prior releases and was a major part of the writing process. Poison The Well had been in the middle of pre-production for an entire record&#x27;s worth of material when Miller announced his departure.

On December 10, 2004, it was announced that Poison the Well would be covering a The Smashing Pumpkins song for the ReIgnition Recordings Various Artists tribute compilation &quot;The Killer in You: A Tribute to Smashing Pumpkins&quot;. Although Poison the Well had previously recorded a cover of &quot;Today&quot; in October 2000, which remained unreleased, they instead chose to re-enter a studio and record a new cover of &quot;Soma&quot;. &quot;The Killer in You: A Tribute to Smashing Pumpkins&quot; was eventually released digitally on November 15, 2005, and on compact disc three months later on January 31, 2006.
===&quot;Versions&quot; (2005–2008)===
Poison the Well eventually regrouped, added guitarist Jason Boyer to replace Miller, and started working on new musical ideas that would be the early stages of their fourth studio album, &quot;Versions&quot;. After months of working and writing material, the band set off in early 2005 to work and record with Pelle Henricsson and Eskil Lövström at Tonteknik Studios in Umeå, Sweden. After completing the first two recording sessions and returning home, Poison the Well announced that they were parting ways with Atlantic Records after only one album because of &quot;creative differences&quot;. Atlantic Records had given full creative control with the writing and recording of &quot;You Come Before You&quot;, not interfering and allowing the band to do what they pleased. But, after not seeing eye to eye on the direction Poison The Well had decided to move, Atlantic agreed to let the band go.

Even though the band had no label, they returned to writing material for the third and final session. The band had been in contact with Ferret Music president Carl Severson about signing with the label. Severson had been friends and a fan of the band for many years and expressed interest in signing them. After signing at the end of 2006, the band left once again for Sweden to finish up the record. &quot;Versions&quot; was released on Ferret Music on April 2, 2007, in Europe and April 3, 2007, worldwide. On February 22, 2007, they began touring in support of the album. The band also brought on Brad Clifford of Since by Man on guitar and their former guitar tech Bradley Grace on bass towards the end of this tour cycle. On March 29, 2007, Undecided Records released &quot;Distance Makes the Heart Grow Fonder&quot; digitally.

===&quot;The Tropic Rot&quot; (2008–2009)===

The writing process for &quot;The Tropic Rot&quot; started a few weeks after Poison the Well finished up the touring cycle for &quot;Versions&quot;. The band wanted to make a record that was more focused musically and bigger sonically. Poison the Well wrote the entire record in four and a half months in a condemned and purportedly haunted bar, the remnants of Ray&#x27;s Downtown Blues which is now Longboards, in West Palm Beach, Florida. &quot;The Tropic Rot&quot; had originally been slated to be made with producer J. Robbins, but had to be cancelled due to a serious family emergency.

Steve Evetts was picked among other potential producers the band thought could capture the record the way they wanted it and could start as soon as possible. The record was recorded at Castle Oaks Production and The Candy Shop studios and was released on July 7, 2009 through Ferret Music. The album charted at No. 180 in its first week of release on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

While on the first stop of their September 2009 tour with Billy Talent, Poison The Well was robbed at a tour stop in Detroit. As the band was asleep in their hotel, thieves drove off with their van and trailer containing all of their musical gear, band merchandise, and a majority of their personal possessions and clothes. After taking a few days off to get a new van and obtain some temporary gear, the band quickly produced and began selling T-shirts to raise money and buy new equipment, with the shirts containing a detailed description of all musical gear stolen including guitar and amplifier serial numbers.

=== Hiatus, external projects and reissues (2010–2012) ===
On July 14, 2010, after eight months of inactivity, Poison the Well released a press statement announcing a hiatus to &quot;explore other interests.&quot; Since then, drummer Chris Hornbrook undertook session work as well as drumming for Los Angeles-based electronic dance music band Big Black Delta, New Jersey post-hardcore band, Senses Fail and for the solo project of Dillinger Escape Plan vocalist Greg Puciato. Ryan Primack remained involved with music, working with his former bandmate Derek Miller&#x27;s band Sleigh Bells as both their production manager and second live guitar player.

=== Reunion shows (2015–2023) ===
In May 2015, Poison the Well reformed for two reunion shows: a warm-up headlining show on May 15 at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, and a performance at the Skate and Surf festival on May 17 in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Beginning with these shows, the band performed with Primack on lead guitar, Hornbrook on drums, Moreira on vocals and Grace on bass; the same core members that had participated in the band prior to their hiatus, with the exception of rhythm guitarist Clifford. The 2015 shows featured rhythm guitar player Ariel Arro, formerly of the Florida hardcore band Glasseater.

In 2016, Poison the Well regrouped for a total of eleven shows, performed between June and August.

Poison the Well was scheduled to perform at the Psycho Las Vegas festival in Las Vegas, Nevada in August 2020 and at Furnace Fest in Birmingham, Alabama in September 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both events were postponed. The band was quickly rescheduled to appear at the 2021 edition of Psycho Las Vegas, due to take place between August 20–22, 2021 and at the 2021 edition of Furnace Fest, due to take place between September 24–26, 2021.

===Upcoming sixth studio album (2024–present)===
In August 2024, Poison the Well announced in a note included in a recently-released vinyl box set of all their albums that they have begun working on their first studio album in fifteen years. They released the first single from it, &quot;Trembling Level&quot;, in January 2025.

<text>In mathematics, a Cantor space, named for Georg Cantor, is a topological abstraction of the classical Cantor set: a topological space is a Cantor space if it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. In set theory, the topological space 2ω is called &quot;the&quot; Cantor space.

== Examples ==

The Cantor set itself is a Cantor space. But the canonical example of a Cantor space is the countably infinite topological product of the discrete 2-point space {0, 1}. This is usually written as formula_1 or 2ω (where 2 denotes the 2-element set {0,1} with the discrete topology). A point in 2ω is an infinite binary sequence, that is a sequence that assumes only the values 0 or 1. Given such a sequence &quot;a&quot;0, &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2..., one can map it to the real number
:formula_2
This mapping gives a homeomorphism from 2ω onto the Cantor set, demonstrating that 2ω is indeed a Cantor space.

Cantor spaces occur abundantly in real analysis. For example, they exist as subspaces in every perfect, complete metric space. (To see this, note that in such a space, any non-empty perfect set contains two disjoint non-empty perfect subsets of arbitrarily small diameter, and so one can imitate the construction
of the usual Cantor set.) Also, every uncountable, separable, completely metrizable space contains
Cantor spaces as subspaces. This includes most of the common spaces in real analysis.

== Characterization ==

A topological characterization of Cantor spaces is given by Brouwer&#x27;s theorem:

The topological property of having a base consisting of clopen sets is sometimes known as &quot;zero-dimensionality&quot;. Brouwer&#x27;s theorem can be restated as:

This theorem is also equivalent (via Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras) to the fact that any two countable atomless Boolean algebras are isomorphic.

== Properties ==
As can be expected from Brouwer&#x27;s theorem, Cantor spaces appear in several forms. But many properties of Cantor spaces can be established using 2ω, because its construction as a product makes it amenable to analysis.

Cantor spaces have the following properties:
* The cardinality of any Cantor space is formula_3, that is, the cardinality of the continuum.
* The product of two (or even any finite or countable number of) Cantor spaces is a Cantor space. Along with the Cantor function, this fact can be used to construct space-filling curves.
* A (non-empty) Hausdorff topological space is compact metrizable if and only if it is a continuous image of a Cantor space.

Let &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) denote the space of all real-valued, bounded continuous functions on a topological space &quot;X&quot;. Let &quot;K&quot; denote a compact metric space, and Δ denote the Cantor set. Then the Cantor set has the following property:
* &quot;C&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) is isometric to a closed subspace of &quot;C&quot;(Δ).
In general, this isometry is not unique, and thus is not properly a universal property in the categorical sense.

*The group of all homeomorphisms of the Cantor space is simple.

<doc id="352387" wikidata="Q3121113" url="?curid=352387" title="Gustave Biéler">
<text>Gustave Biéler DSO MBE CdeG (26 March 1904 – 5 September 1944) was a Canadian Special Operations Executive agent during World War II.

== Early life ==
Gustave Daniel Alfred Biéler was born on 26 March 1904 in Beurlay, France, to Swiss parents and raised in Lausanne, Switzerland. At the age of twenty, he emigrated to Canada where he settled in the city of Montreal, working as a school teacher at l&#x27;Institut Français Évangélique in Pointe-aux-Trembles, and then as a translator for Sun Life Assurance. He became a naturalised British subject.

== Wartime activities ==
At the outbreak of World War II, although married with two children, Biéler joined the Canadian Army in Le Régiment de Maisonneuve and was shipped to a base in Britain. His wife Marguerite Geymonat worked as a broadcaster to the troops in Europe on Radio Canada International. Because of his familiarity with France and his fluency in the French and English languages he joined the Special Operations Executive in 1942.

Known by his wartime nickname &quot;Guy,&quot; or his code name &quot;Commandant Guy&quot;, following his specialised training at Camp X, Colonel Maurice Buckmaster, the SOE commander, wrote in his file that Biéler was the best student SOE had. 

===Operations in France===
On 18 November 1942, Biéler, along with wireless operator Arthur Staggs and Michael Trotobas, were parachuted into France. In the dark of the night, Biéler severely injured his back after landing on rocks and he spent several months recovering.

He had strong communication and organizational skills, and as the head of the Musician network he and fellow SOE agents and members of the French Resistance organized very productive sabotage missions. Operating from a base in Saint-Quentin in the northern Aisne &quot;département&quot;, Biéler&#x27;s twenty-five teams, scattered over different areas of northern France, succeeded in damaging or destroying German gasoline storage tanks, rail lines, bridges, canal locks, and the electric tractors used to tow barges on the shipping waterways. Their repeated efforts hampered the movement of enemy arms and troops but the most important job for Biéler would eventually be the preparations for D-Day.

His daughter Jacqueline Bieler researched &quot;Commandant Guy&#x27;s&quot; life extensively, for her book &quot;Out of Night and Fog&quot; and provided the following summary of his escapades in France to the CBC:

His operations were so successful that the Germans instituted a special manhunt to get him and his team and on the morning of 14 January 1944 the Gestapo arrested him and agent Yolande Beekman in the Café Moulin Brulé in Saint-Quentin. At the Gestapo headquarters there the two were tortured repeatedly but never broke and a few months later Biéler was transferred to Flossenbürg concentration camp in the Oberpfalz region of Bavaria, where the brutal torture continued. According to his daughter Jacqueline Bieler&#x27;s research, prisoners at Flossenburg were called &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; (Night and Fog). &quot;When you were designated an NN prisoner, you were meant to disappear. If the Red Cross asked questions about you, they weren&#x27;t supposed to find out anything.&quot;

Unable to get useful information from him, the Germans executed Major Guy Biéler by a firing squad – instead of the gas chamber or piano wire often used on other agents – with a guard of honour, on 5 September 1944. &quot;It proves even the Germans could not but recognize his great qualities,&quot; according to then-Colonel Maurice Buckmaster, the SOE commander.

==Recognition==

<text>The &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series is a series of twelve children&#x27;s adventure novels by English author Arthur Ransome. Set in the interwar period, the novels involve group adventures by children, mainly in the school holidays and mainly in England. They revolve around outdoor activities, especially sailing. Literary critic Peter Hunt believes it &quot;changed British literature, affected a whole generation&#x27;s view of holidays, helped to create the national image of the English Lake District and added Arthur Ransome&#x27;s name to the select list of classic British children&#x27;s authors.&quot; The series remains popular and inspires visits to the Lake District and Norfolk Broads, where many of the books are set. 

There are several societies for studying and promoting Ransome&#x27;s work, notably this series. The earliest was the Arthur Ransome Club in Japan. The British-based Arthur Ransome Society has an international membership.

==Overview==
The series begins with &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot;, published in 1930. The Walker children from London, staying at a lakeside farm in the school holidays, sail a dinghy named &quot;Swallow&quot;, while the local Blackett girls, living on the opposite shore, have one named &quot;Amazon&quot;. The Walkers see themselves as explorers, while the Blacketts declare themselves pirates. They clash on an island in the lake, make friends, and have a series of adventures that weave tales of pirates and exploration into everyday life in rural England. In subsequent adventures, the children change roles and become explorers or miners. &quot;Winter Holiday&quot; (1933) has them meet Dick and Dorothea Callum (&quot;the Ds&quot;), siblings of a similar age also visiting the area. Dick aspires to be a scientist, Dorothea a writer.

Two of the books feature the Callums without the Swallows or Amazons: &quot;Coot Club&quot; and &quot;The Big Six&quot;. They are set in the accurately drawn Norfolk Broads, notably the small village of Horning and its watery surroundings. Two other books are set in Suffolk and Essex around the River Orwell; one involves an involuntary trip across the North Sea to the Netherlands. Two books, &quot;Peter Duck&quot; and &quot;Missee Lee&quot;, and possibly also &quot;Great Northern?&quot;, are metafictional: fictional stories of the protagonists&#x27; voyages to exotic lands, as imagined by themselves.

==Major characters==

The crew of the &quot;Swallow&quot; are the siblings John, Susan, Titty and Roger Walker. John, the eldest, is the captain and usually in charge. Susan is first mate, in charge of stores, cooking and general crew well-being, almost as a surrogate mother. Titty (a nickname derived from the fairy tale &quot;Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse&quot; in Joseph Jacobs &quot;Old English Fairy Tales&quot; published in 1890) is &quot;able seaman&quot; and the most imaginative member. She often conjures up her own adventures, while becoming a hero in the novels, for instance, by winning the &quot;war&quot; in &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; or finding an underground spring in &quot;Pigeon Post&quot;. Roger is the youngest, originally the ship&#x27;s boy, but later promoted to able seaman. Their youngest sister Bridget (originally nicknamed &quot;Vicky&quot; due to a resemblance to pictures of Queen Victoria in old age; the nickname is dropped in later books as she loses her resemblance) also joins the crew in &quot;Secret Water&quot;. Roger is seven in the first novel and Bridget has her second birthday. Bridget grows up quickly into a six-year-old when she becomes a full character.

The crew of the &quot;Amazon&quot; are the sisters Nancy and Peggy Blackett. Nancy – who disdains her baptismal name Ruth because her uncle has said that pirates are supposed to be ruthless – is a strong character who can be seen as a tomboy. Her speech includes many nautical and pirate terms. She often leads both crews. Peggy (real name Margaret) puts up a show of being as tough as Nancy, but often needs her encouragement to get through the more dangerous adventures. She is afraid of thunderstorms.

The brother and sister Dick and Dorothea (Dot) Callum are introduced in the fourth book, &quot;Winter Holiday&quot;. They are the intellectuals – Dick in matters of science, Dorothea in the arts. The Callums later acquire a dinghy of their own, the &quot;Scarab&quot;. The Swallows initially wonder about Dot &quot;an astronomer might be quite useful... but what&#x27;s she going to do&quot;? (Dot overhears this.) However, they are impressed by Dick&#x27;s skating: &quot;He can skate ... like anything&quot;.

The Callums are the link to a different location and set of characters after their appearance in &quot;Winter Holiday&quot;. The two following books, (Coot Club and The Big Six), are set in the Norfolk Broads, where they meet the Coot Club members: Tom Dudgeon; the twins, Port and Starboard; and Bill, Joe and Pete, the three sons of boatbuilders. They are known as the Death and Glories.

With some exceptions, the exact ages of the characters are not stated. In the first book they run from Roger at seven to about 12 to 14 (John and Nancy). All characters age as the series goes on; the final book occurs three to four years after the first. (See timeline below.) There is an inconsistency in the only two dates mentioned in the series. In the first the year is stated to be 1929, while the second book, &quot;Swallowdale&quot;, supposed to take place a year later, gives the year as 1931. A second inconsistency is that while Bridget is only about two years old in the first novel, she has aged more than four years by the time of &quot;Secret Water&quot;.

While the emphasis in all the books is on the young protagonists, many generally benevolent adults appear. Most prominent are the Blackett sisters&#x27; uncle Jim Turner, called Captain Flint by the children after a character in &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, and Mrs Barrable in &quot;Coot Club&quot;. A painfully shy geologist, Timothy Stedding, is also accepted by the children in &quot;Pigeon Post&quot; and included in their adventures. He reappears in &quot;The Picts and the Martyrs&quot;.

==Settings==
The &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series has strong links with the real world. Extensive elements in the characters and the settings can be traced to incidents in Ransome&#x27;s life and are raw material for much discussion and theorising about precise relationships. This contributes strongly to the air of authenticity.

The first book, &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot;, and four sequels — &quot;Swallowdale&quot;, &quot;Winter Holiday,&quot; &quot;Pigeon Post&quot; and &quot;The Picts and the Martyrs&quot; — are set in and around an unnamed lake in the English Lake District. Most of the unfinished &quot;Coots in the North&quot; would also have been set on the lake, if Ransome had completed it before his death. The lake and surrounding fells amalgamate Windermere and Coniston Water, places where Ransome spent much of his childhood and later life. Many places in the books can be identified with real locations, though Ransome has modified the overall location in producing his fictional setting. The geography of the lake generally resembles Windermere (though Wild Cat Island has a number of elements from Peel Island in Coniston Water) while the fells and surrounding hills resemble the Coniston area more closely.

&quot;Coot Club&quot; and &quot;The Big Six&quot; are set in the accurately represented Norfolk Broads, particularly the small village of Horning and its surrounding rivers and broads. &quot;Coots in the North&quot; also begins in the Broads before moving to the lake in the north.

&quot;We Didn&#x27;t Mean to Go to Sea&quot; and &quot;Secret Water&quot; are set in coastal Suffolk and Essex, with the former involving an involuntary, sometimes terrifying voyage from Pin Mill on the River Orwell to Flushing in the Netherlands, and the latter the exploration of the islands of Hamford Water near Walton-on-the-Naze.

&quot;Peter Duck&quot; and &quot;Missee Lee&quot; involve voyages of the schooner &quot;Wild Cat&quot; to the Caribbean and the South China Sea. These stories appear to be metafictional in relation to the rest of the series, and were originally planned by Ransome (see below) as stories written by the children. The final published works, however, are presented simply as adventures in the series, though different in a number of ways. Most obvious is the inclusion of more fear and violence and the fact that the extended voyages would have taken the children from school for unacceptably long periods. Both books are described on their title pages as &quot;based on information supplied by the Swallows and Amazons&quot;, a description which is absent from the rest of the series.

Two abandoned chapters of &quot;Peter Duck&quot; (called &quot;Their Own Story&quot;) were found in Ransome&#x27;s papers held in the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds. They describe the story of &quot;Peter Duck&quot; being made up by the Walkers and Blacketts on a wherry in the Norfolk Broads during the winter after the events described in &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot;. This event was later referenced in &quot;Swallowdale&quot;, but not in &quot;Peter Duck&quot; itself.

The final complete book, &quot;Great Northern?&quot;, is set in the Outer Hebrides off the west coast of Scotland. It is sometimes included with &quot;Peter Duck&quot; and &quot;Missee Lee&quot; as metafictional, as the story would involve the children being away from school during the nesting season, which is in term time. Furthermore, the use of firearms, though reasonable within the plot, seems to be at odds with the more peaceable adventures in most of the rest of the series. Myles North, the ornithologist who had originally suggested the plot to Ransome as the basis for a new novel, had initially proposed this, with the &quot;Wild Cat&quot; voyage again providing the background. Ransome, however, wrote in reply that he wanted to maintain the clear distinction between the &quot;romantic stories and the real ones&quot;, and that he had decided upon a &quot;realistic treatment&quot; for &quot;Great Northern?&quot;.

==Timeline==
The following diagram shows the implied timeline of the books in the series. The initials indicate an acronym for the title of each book, e.g. &quot;SA&quot; is Swallows and Amazons; &quot;PD&quot; is Peter Duck, and so on.

==Illustrations==
Current editions of the Swallows and Amazons series have illustrations drawn by Ransome himself. The first edition of &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; was published almost without illustrations. Ransome so disliked the pictures by Steven Spurrier that were commissioned by his publisher, Jonathan Cape, that the only pictures in the first edition were the endpaper map of the lake and a map of Wild Cat Island. For the second edition, Clifford Webb was commissioned to produce the illustrations, which met with grudging approval from Ransome. Webb also illustrated &quot;Swallowdale&quot;, but Ransome decided that he would personally illustrate the third book, &quot;Peter Duck&quot;. As this book was supposedly based on information supplied by the children themselves, Ransome drew the pictures as though done by the characters. These illustrations were so popular that Ransome illustrated the remainder of his books himself. In 1938, he drew his own pictures for &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; and &quot;Swallowdale&quot; to replace Webb&#x27;s.

Ransome&#x27;s pictures were done in pen and ink with no colour, although colours have been added by some publishers in later editions. Typically, figures in the pictures are shown from behind, though some show the faces of a few of the characters. Taqui Altounyan, the oldest of the children to whom the first edition of &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; was dedicated, recalls that Ransome &quot;shirked drawing faces and got over the difficulty with back views of shaggy heads of hair or hats.&quot;

==Reception==
The sixth book, &quot;Pigeon Post&quot;, won the inaugural Carnegie Medal from the Library Association in June 1937, recognising it as the best 1936 children&#x27;s book by a British subject. It was reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; the month after J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. of Philadelphia published the first U.S. edition. Ellen Lewis Buell welcomed the latest work in the six-year-old series that had firmly established &quot;a special niche in juvenile literature&quot;. She noted the children&#x27;s &quot;vivid collective imagination which turned play into serious business&quot; (hunting a gold mine on the moors) and observed, &quot;It is the portrayal of this spirit which makes play a matter of desperate yet enjoyable earnestness which gives their distinctive stamp to Mr. Ransome&#x27;s books... Because he understands the whole-heartedness of youth he can invest a momentary experiment, such as young Roger&#x27;s Indian scout work, with real suspense.&quot;

Critical remarks have been rare. Roald Dahl disliked the series, explaining that he found the characters &quot;too soft&quot;. The children&#x27;s writer Elinor Lyon, in an autobiographical introduction to a reprint of the first book in her series about a pair of adventurous young siblings on the west coast of Scotland, remembers feeling a &quot;dislike of the characters in &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; who are so &quot;good&quot; at things like sailing. I thought I&#x27;d have children who got things wrong but somehow survived.&quot;

==Adaptations==
In 1963, the BBC screened a television series starring Susan George as &quot;Kitty&quot; (changed from Titty to Ransome&#x27;s strong distaste). The six-part series was aired in September–October 1963.

In 1974, EMI produced a film version of the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot;, starring Virginia McKenna and Ronald Fraser.

In 1984, the BBC adapted the two Norfolk-set stories, &quot;Coot Club&quot; and &quot;The Big Six&quot;, for television, entitled &quot;Swallows and Amazons Forever!&quot;

In 2010, a stage musical version of the first book in the series was created at Bristol Old Vic, adapted by Helen Edmundson with music by Neil Hannon, and directed by Tom Morris. The show was toured, including a stint in London&#x27;s West End.

A film version of &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; by Harbour Pictures and BBC Films was released in the United Kingdom on 19 August 2016. Like the 1963 version, the film changes the character Titty′s name, this time to &#x27;Tatty&#x27; in keeping with original fairy-story names.

In 2018 a stage adaptation of the series by Bryony Lavery opened at Storyhouse, Chester.

<doc id="352396" wikidata="Q311404" url="?curid=352396" title="PF (firewall)">
<text>PF (Packet Filter, also written pf) is a BSD licensed stateful packet filter, a central piece of software for firewalling. It is comparable to netfilter (iptables), ipfw, and ipfilter.

PF was developed for OpenBSD, but has been ported to many other operating systems.

== History ==
PF was originally designed as replacement for Darren Reed&#x27;s IPFilter, from which it derives much of its rule syntax. IPFilter was removed from OpenBSD&#x27;s CVS tree on 30 May 2001 due to OpenBSD developers&#x27; concerns with its license.

The initial version of PF was written by Daniel Hartmeier. It appeared in OpenBSD 3.0, which was released on 1 December 2001.

It was later extensively redesigned by Henning Brauer and Ryan McBride with most of the code written by Henning Brauer. Henning Brauer is currently the main developer of PF.

== Features ==
The filtering syntax is similar to IPFilter, with some modifications to make it clearer. Network address translation (NAT) and quality of service (QoS) have been integrated into PF. Features such as pfsync and CARP for failover and redundancy, authpf for session authentication, and ftp-proxy to ease firewalling the difficult FTP protocol, have also extended PF.
Also PF supports SMP (Symmetric multiprocessing) &amp; STO (Stateful Tracking Options).

One of the many innovative features is PF&#x27;s logging. PF&#x27;s logging is configurable per rule within the pf.conf and logs are provided from PF by a pseudo-network interface called &quot;pflog&quot;, which is the only way to lift data from kernel-level mode for user-level programs. Logs may be monitored using standard utilities such as tcpdump, which in OpenBSD has been extended especially for the purpose, or saved to disk in the tcpdump/pcap binary format using the &quot;pflogd&quot; daemon.

== Ports ==
Apart from running on its home platform OpenBSD, PF has been ported to many other operating systems, however there are major differences in capabilities. Some ports date back many years. OpenBSD always has the latest version with the most features.

PF is currently used in:
* FreeBSD starting with version 5.3

* Apple macOS starting with &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; (Mac OS X 10.6)
* Apple iOS and iPadOS, used by all iPhones and iPads
* NetBSD from version 3.0
* DragonFly BSD from version 1.1
* Debian GNU/kFreeBSD
* Oracle Solaris
* QNX and thereby in many BlackBerry smartphones models

* Internet protocol suite
* Reverse-path forwarding

<doc id="352398" wikidata="Q567843" url="?curid=352398" title="Space-filling curve">
<text>In mathematical analysis, a space-filling curve is a curve whose range reaches every point in a higher dimensional region, typically the unit square (or more generally an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional unit hypercube). Because Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) was the first to discover one, space-filling curves in the 2-dimensional plane are sometimes called &quot;Peano curves&quot;, but that phrase also refers to the Peano curve, the specific example of a space-filling curve found by Peano.

The closely related FASS curves (approximately space-Filling, self-Avoiding, Simple, and Self-similar curves)
can be thought of as finite approximations of a certain type of space-filling curves.

== Definition ==
Intuitively, a curve in two or three (or higher) dimensions can be thought of as the path of a continuously moving point. To eliminate the inherent vagueness of this notion, Jordan in 1887 introduced the following rigorous definition, which has since been adopted as the precise description of the notion of a &quot;curve&quot;:

In the most general form, the range of such a function may lie in an arbitrary topological space, but in the most commonly studied cases, the range will lie in a Euclidean space such as the 2-dimensional plane (a &quot;planar curve&quot;) or the 3-dimensional space (&quot;space curve&quot;).

Sometimes, the curve is identified with the image of the function (the set of all possible values of the function), instead of the function itself. It is also possible to define curves without endpoints to be a continuous function on the real line (or on the open unit interval ).

==History==
In 1890, Giuseppe Peano discovered a continuous curve, now called the Peano curve, that passes through every point of the unit square. His purpose was to construct a continuous mapping from the unit interval onto the unit square. Peano was motivated by Georg Cantor&#x27;s earlier counterintuitive result that the infinite number of points in a unit interval is the same cardinality as the infinite number of points in any finite-dimensional manifold, such as the unit square. The problem Peano solved was whether such a mapping could be continuous; i.e., a curve that fills a space. Peano&#x27;s solution does not set up a continuous one-to-one correspondence between the unit interval and the unit square, and indeed such a correspondence does not exist (see below).

It was common to associate the vague notions of &quot;thinness&quot; and 1-dimensionality to curves; all normally encountered curves were piecewise differentiable (that is, have piecewise continuous derivatives), and such curves cannot fill up the entire unit square. Therefore, Peano&#x27;s space-filling curve was found to be highly counterintuitive.

From Peano&#x27;s example, it was easy to deduce continuous curves whose ranges contained the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hypercube (for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;). It was also easy to extend Peano&#x27;s example to continuous curves without endpoints, which filled the entire &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space (where &quot;n&quot; is 2, 3, or any other positive integer).

Most well-known space-filling curves are constructed iteratively as the limit of a sequence of piecewise linear continuous curves, each one more closely approximating the space-filling limit.

Peano&#x27;s ground-breaking article contained no illustrations of his construction, which is defined in terms of ternary expansions and a mirroring operator. But the graphical construction was perfectly clear to him—he made an ornamental tiling showing a picture of the curve in his home in Turin. Peano&#x27;s article also ends by observing that the technique can be obviously extended to other odd bases besides base 3. His choice to avoid any appeal to graphical visualization was motivated by a desire for a completely rigorous proof owing nothing to pictures. At that time (the beginning of the foundation of general topology), graphical arguments were still included in proofs, yet were becoming a hindrance to understanding often counterintuitive results.

A year later, David Hilbert published in the same journal a variation of Peano&#x27;s construction. Hilbert&#x27;s article was the first to include a picture helping to visualize the construction technique, essentially the same as illustrated here. The analytic form of the Hilbert curve, however, is more complicated than Peano&#x27;s.

== Outline of the construction of a space-filling curve ==
Let formula_1 denote the Cantor space formula_2.

We start with a continuous function formula_3 from the Cantor space formula_1 onto the entire unit interval formula_5. (The restriction of the Cantor function to the Cantor set is an example of such a function.) From it, we get a continuous function formula_6 from the topological product formula_7 onto the entire unit square formula_8 by setting

formula_9

Since the Cantor set formula_1 is homeomorphic to its cartesian product with itself formula_11, there is a continuous bijection formula_12 from the Cantor set onto formula_7. The composition formula_14 of formula_6 and formula_12 is a continuous function mapping the Cantor set onto the entire unit square. (Alternatively, we could use the theorem that every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set to get the function formula_14.)

Finally, one can extend formula_14 to a continuous function formula_19 whose domain is the entire unit interval formula_5. This can be done either by using the Tietze extension theorem on each of the components of formula_14, or by simply extending formula_14 &quot;linearly&quot; (that is, on each of the deleted open interval formula_23 in the construction of the Cantor set, we define the extension part of formula_19 on formula_23 to be the line segment within the unit square joining the values formula_26 and formula_27).

== Properties ==
If a curve is not injective, then one can find two intersecting &quot;subcurves&quot; of the curve, each obtained by considering the images of two disjoint segments from the curve&#x27;s domain (the unit line segment). The two subcurves intersect if the intersection of the two images is non-empty. One might be tempted to think that the meaning of &quot;curves intersecting&quot; is that they necessarily cross each other, like the intersection point of two non-parallel lines, from one side to the other. However, two curves (or two subcurves of one curve) may contact one another without crossing, as, for example, a line tangent to a circle does.

A non-self-intersecting continuous curve cannot fill the unit square because that will make the curve a homeomorphism from the unit interval onto the unit square (any continuous bijection from a compact space onto a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism). But a unit square has no cut-point, and so cannot be homeomorphic to the unit interval, in which all points except the endpoints are cut-points. There exist non-self-intersecting curves of nonzero area, the Osgood curves, but by Netto&#x27;s theorem they are not space-filling.

For the classic Peano and Hilbert space-filling curves, where two subcurves intersect (in the technical sense), there is self-contact without self-crossing. A space-filling curve can be (everywhere) self-crossing if its approximation curves are self-crossing. A space-filling curve&#x27;s approximations can be self-avoiding, as the figures above illustrate. In 3 dimensions, self-avoiding approximation curves can even contain knots. Approximation curves remain within a bounded portion of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, but their lengths increase without bound.

Space-filling curves are special cases of fractal curves. No differentiable space-filling curve can exist. Roughly speaking, differentiability puts a bound on how fast the curve can turn. Michał Morayne proved that the continuum hypothesis is equivalent to the existence of a Peano curve such that at each point of the real line at least one of its components is differentiable.

== The Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem ==
The Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem is the following characterization of spaces that are the continuous image of curves:

Spaces that are the continuous image of a unit interval are sometimes called &quot;Peano spaces&quot;.

In many formulations of the Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem, &quot;second-countable&quot; is replaced by &quot;metrizable&quot;. These two formulations are equivalent. In one direction a compact Hausdorff space is a normal space and, by the Urysohn metrization theorem, second-countable then implies metrizable. Conversely, a compact metric space is second-countable.

==Kleinian groups==

There are many natural examples of space-filling, or rather sphere-filling, curves in the theory of doubly degenerate Kleinian groups. For example,
 showed that the circle at infinity of the universal cover of a fiber of a mapping torus of a pseudo-Anosov map is a sphere-filling curve. (Here the sphere is the sphere at infinity of hyperbolic 3-space.)

==Integration==

Wiener pointed out in &quot;The Fourier Integral and Certain of its Applications&quot; that space-filling curves could be used to reduce Lebesgue integration in higher dimensions to Lebesgue integration in one dimension.

<text>Anna Louise Day Hicks (October 16, 1916 – October 21, 2003) was an American politician and lawyer from Boston, Massachusetts, best known for her staunch opposition to desegregation in Boston public schools, and especially to court-ordered busing, in the 1960s and 1970s. A longtime member of Boston&#x27;s school board and city council, she served one term in the United States House of Representatives, succeeding Speaker of the House John W. McCormack.

The daughter of a wealthy and prominent attorney and judge, Hicks attended Simmons College and received her qualification as a teacher from Wheelock College. She worked as a first-grade teacher prior to marrying in 1942. After the births of her two children, Hicks returned to school and completed a Bachelor of Science degree at Boston University in 1952. In 1955, she received a JD from Boston University Law School, attained admission to the bar, and entered into partnership with her brother as the firm of Hicks and Day.

In 1960, Hicks won election to Boston&#x27;s school board, where she served until 1970, including holding the position of chairwoman from 1963 to 1965. During her tenure on the school committee, she came into conflict with civil rights groups and black residents of Boston over her opposition to plans to integrate schools by busing students between districts to achieve racial balance. In addition, for 114 days in the summer of 1965, the Reverend Vernon Carter, pastor of All Saints Lutheran Church in the Southend of Boston protested in front of the school committee building in which Hicks entered and exited frequently. In 1967, she ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Boston. From 1970 to 1971, she served on the Boston City Council. In 1970, she won the Democratic nomination for the U.S. House seat of the retiring John McCormack. She went on to win the general election and serve one term, 1971 to 1973. In 1971, she was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Boston. She was defeated for reelection to Congress in 1972 by Joe Moakley, a Democrat who ran as an independent.

After leaving Congress, Hicks was the head of an anti-busing group, &quot;Restore Our Alienated Rights&quot; (ROAR), which remained active until a 1976 federal court decision mandated busing to achieve integration in public schools. In 1974, Hicks returned to the Boston City Council, and she served until 1978, including holding the council president&#x27;s position in 1976. She lost reelection in 1977, but was appointed to fill a vacancy in 1979. She served until 1981, and was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection. Hicks died in Boston in 2003.

==Early life==
Hicks was the daughter of William J. Day and Anna ( McCarron) Day. Hicks described her father, a lawyer and an influential judge in Boston, as her &quot;greatest influence&quot;. The child of poor Irish immigrants, William Day became one of the wealthiest men in South Boston as a result of his law practice, real estate investments and his role as director of South Boston&#x27;s Mount Washington Cooperative Bank. Day was admired by Boston&#x27;s Irish community; as a banker he provided assistance to families struggling to make mortgage payments and as a judge he was particularly lenient towards juvenile defendants. In her own political career, Hicks would benefit from her father&#x27;s reputation.

Hicks&#x27; mother died when Hicks was fourteen. In 1942, she married John Hicks, an engineer, and they had two sons, John and William. John Edward Hicks (b. 1945) had several brushes with the law, including a prison sentence for kidnapping. He disappeared in 1978, while he was facing more than 20 charges related to a 1977 incident in which he threatened harm to several customers inside a restaurant and then attempted to run over several of them in the parking lot. John Hicks was still missing at the time of his mother&#x27;s death.

Hicks studied home economics at Simmons College and then later earned a teaching certificate at Wheelock College. She taught first grade in Brookline, Massachusetts, for two years and pursued a degree in education at Boston University.

Hicks earned a Bachelor of Science degree from BU in 1952, and a JD from Boston University Law School in 1955. Hicks stated that her father&#x27;s death in 1950 left her resolved to follow in his footsteps. At the time, female law students were still rare; Hicks was one of only nine women in her class of 232. Hicks formed close friendships with two other female students, one Jewish and one black, and she studied for exams with a group made up of mostly minorities. Hicks was admitted to the bar and practiced law with her brother John as the firm of Hicks and Day.

==&quot;De facto&quot; segregation==

Hicks ran successfully for the Boston School Committee in 1961, presenting herself as a reform candidate. Her campaign slogan was &quot;The only mother on the ballot&quot;, which was factually true, although her own children were not enrolled in any public schools. In January 1963, she became the committee chairperson and seemed likely to be endorsed by the leading reform group when, in June, the Boston chapter of the NAACP demanded &quot;an immediate public acknowledgment of &quot;de facto&quot; segregation in the Boston public school system.&quot; At the time, 13 city schools were at least 90% black.

The committee refused to acknowledge the segregation. Hicks was recognized as the holdout; within months she became Boston&#x27;s most popular politician and the most controversial, requiring police bodyguards 24 hours a day. Hicks became nationally known in 1965 when she opposed court-ordered busing of students into inner-city schools to achieve integration.

From its creation under the National Housing Act of 1934 signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Federal Housing Administration used its official mortgage insurance underwriting policy explicitly to prevent school desegregation. In 1963, Boston Mayor John F. Collins and Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) executive Edward J. Logue organized a consortium of savings banks, cooperatives, and federal and state savings and loan associations in the city called the Boston Banks Urban Renewal Group (B-BURG) that would reverse redline parts of Dorchester, Roxbury, and Mattapan along Blue Hill Avenue during the administration of Kevin White.

Despite the passage of legislation by the 156th Massachusetts General Court banning racial discrimination or segregation in housing in 1950, as well as the issuance of Executive Order 11063 by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 requiring all federal agencies to prevent racial discrimination in all federally-funded subsidized housing in the United States, the Boston Housing Authority (BHA) Board actively segregated the public housing developments in the city during the Collins administration as well, with BHA departments engaging in bureaucratic resistance against integration through at least 1966 and the Board retaining control over tenant assignment until 1968.

On April 1, 1965, a special committee appointed by Massachusetts Education Commissioner Owen Kiernan released its final report finding that more than half of black students enrolled in Boston Public Schools (BPS) attended institutions with enrollments that were at least 80% black and that housing segregation in the city had caused the racial imbalance. Massachusetts Governor John Volpe filed a request for legislation from the state legislature that defined schools with nonwhite enrollments greater than 50 percent to be imbalanced and granted the State Board of Education the power to withhold state funds from any school district in the state that was found to have racial imbalance, which Volpe would sign into law the following August.

By refusing to admit that segregation existed in city schools and by declaring that children were the &quot;pawns&quot; of racial politics, she came to personify the discord that existed between some working class Irish Americans and African Americans. &quot;Boston schools are a scapegoat for those who have failed to solve the housing, economic, and social problems of the black citizen&quot;, Hicks said. She asserted that, while thirteen Boston schools were at least 90% black, Chinatown schools were 100% Chinese, the North End had schools that were 100% Italian American, and South Boston contained schools that were mostly Irish American. The Boston public schools included a conglomerate of white ethnics with very few WASPs.

Following the passage of the Racial Imbalance Act, Governor Volpe, Mayor Collins, and BPS Superintendent William H. Ohrenberger, opposed and warned the Boston School Committee that a vote that they held that same month to abandon a proposal to bus several hundred blacks students from Roxbury and North Dorchester from three overcrowded schools to nearby schools in Dorchester and Brighton, and purchase an abandoned Hebrew school in Dorchester to relieve the overcrowding instead, could now be held by a court to be deliberate acts of segregation. Pursuant to the Racial Imbalance Act, the state conducted a racial census and found 55 imbalanced schools in the state with 46 in Boston, and in October 1965, the State Board required the School Committee to submit a desegregation plan, which the School Committee did the following December.

In April 1966, the State Board found the plan inadequate and voted to rescind state aid to the district, and in response, the School Committee filed a lawsuit against the State Board challenging both the decision and the constitutionality of the Racial Imbalance Act the following August. In January 1967, Massachusetts Superior Court overturned a Suffolk Superior Court ruling that the State Board had improperly withdrawn the funds and ordered the School Committee to submit an acceptable plan to the State Board within 90 days or else permanently lose funding, which the School Committee did shortly thereafter and the State Board accepted. In June 1967, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the constitutionality of the Racial Imbalance Act and the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren (1953–1969) declined to hear the School Committee&#x27;s appeal in January 1968.

==Mayoral bids, city council, and Congress==
In 1967, Hicks came within 12,000 votes of being elected mayor of Boston, running on the slogan, &quot;You know where I stand.&quot; The nonpartisan race against fellow Democrat Kevin White became so acrimonious that the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; broke a 75-year tradition of political neutrality to endorse White. After the unsuccessful mayoral bid, Hicks ran for city council and won. Two years later, after Speaker John W. McCormack retired after 43 years in Congress, Hicks beat out eleven other candidates to win the Democratic primary for his South Boston congressional district. In heavily Democratic Boston, the winner of that primary was essentially assured victory in the November election.

Hicks served one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1973, becoming the first female Democrat to represent Massachusetts in the House. Despite her identification with the white backlash, Hicks took many progressive stands in Congress. She was a member of the National Organization for Women and lobbied for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment while in Congress. She also won relatively high ratings from the League of Conservation Voters.

While in Congress Hicks ran again for Mayor of Boston in 1971. She made the runoff, but was again defeated by Kevin White, this time by a much wider margin. She sought reelection to Congress in 1972, but was narrowly defeated in the general election by City Councilman Joe Moakley, a more liberal Democrat who was running as an Independent. Moakley reverted to his Democratic party affiliation after he entered the House.

On May 25, 1971, the Massachusetts State Board of Education voted unanimously to withhold state aid from the Boston Public Schools due to the School Committee&#x27;s refusal to use the district&#x27;s open enrollment policy to relieve the city&#x27;s racial imbalance in enrollments, instead routinely granting white students transfers while doing nothing to assist black students attempting to transfer. On March 15, 1972, the Boston NAACP filed a lawsuit, later named &quot;Morgan v. Hennigan&quot;, against the Boston School Committee in federal district court. In 1973, Hicks ran for the Boston City Council again and won. Her most notable campaign took place in autumn 1975, after a federal judge ordered Boston schools to expand their busing programs to comply with the 1971 &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; decision. To counter the trend, Hicks started an organization called Restore Our Alienated Rights (ROAR) which actively engaged in incidents of massive resistance to school desegregation. In 1976, Hicks was elected the first woman president of the Boston City Council, largely on the strength of ROAR, which was then at its peak. During this time Hicks supported another controversial position, a curfew for minors in the city of Boston.

During her political career, Hicks was excoriated by liberal politicians and activists. The columnist Joseph Alsop called her &quot;Joe McCarthy dressed up as Pollyanna&quot;; civil rights leaders likened her to Adolf Hitler or Bull Connor of Birmingham, Alabama. &quot;Newsweek&quot; published a satirical article ridiculing the Irish culture of South Boston, a matter which prompted Hicks to reply with a full-page newspaper ad. There were 223 murders in Boston from 1973 to 1974, but only two dozen involved blacks killing whites. Hicks claimed, however, that there were &quot;at least one hundred black people walking around in the black community who have killed white people during the last two years.&quot; Hicks took aim at &quot;radical agitators&quot; and &quot;pseudo-liberals&quot; of the counterculture. She declared that &quot;white women can no longer walk the streets [of Boston] in safety&quot; and that &quot;justice [had come] to mean special privileges for the black man and the criminal.&quot; She attacked &quot;black militants [who] tyrannize our schools, creating chaos and disruption.&quot; Hicks opposed George Wallace of Alabama, who ran for U.S. President on four occasions: &quot;He&#x27;s a segregationist. I don&#x27;t want to be connected to him.&quot; Hicks continued, &quot;While a large part of my vote probably does come from bigoted people. ... I know I&#x27;m not bigoted. To me the word means all the dreadful southern segregationist, Jim Crow business that&#x27;s always shocked and revolted me.&quot;

On June 21, 1974, Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. ruled in &quot;Morgan v. Hennigan&quot; that the open enrollment and controlled transfer policies that the School Committee created in 1961 and 1971 respectively were being used to effectively discriminate on the basis of race, and that the School Committee had maintained segregation in the Boston Public Schools by adding portable classrooms to overcrowded white schools instead of assigning white students to nearby underutilized black schools, while simultaneously purchasing closed white schools and busing black students past open white schools with vacant seats. In accordance with the Racial Imbalance Act, the School Committee would be required to bus 17,000 to 18,000 students the following September (Phase I) and to formulate a desegregation plan for the 1975–1976 school year by December 16 (Phase II).

On September 12, 1974, 79 of 80 schools were successfully bused (with South Boston High School being the lone exception), and through October 10, there were 149 arrests (40 percent occurring at South Boston High alone), 129 injuries, and $50,000 in property damage. On October 15, an interracial stabbing at Hyde Park High School led to a riot that injured 8, and at South Boston High on December 11, a non-fatal interracial stabbing led to a riotous crowd of 1,800 to 2,500 whites hurling projectiles at police while white students fled the facility and black students remained. Hicks, State Senator William Bulger, and State Representative Raymond Flynn made their way to the school, and Hicks spoke through a bullhorn to the crowd and urged them to allow the black students still in South Boston High to leave in peace to no avail. Decoy buses had to be sent in to the front of the school while the black children boarded other buses in the back of the school. While the police made only 3 arrests, the injured numbered 25 (including 14 police), and the rioters badly damaged 6 police vehicles.

Twenty minutes after Judge Garrity&#x27;s deadline for submitting the Phase II plan expired on December 16, 1974, the School Committee voted to reject the desegregation plan proposed by the department&#x27;s Educational Planning Center. On December 18, Garrity summoned all five Boston School Committee members to court, held three of the members to be in contempt of court on December 27, and told the members on December 30 that he would purge their contempt holdings if they voted to authorize submission of a Phase II plan by January 7. On January 7, 1975, the School Committee directed school department planners to file a voluntary-only busing proposal with the court.

On May 10, 1975, the Massachusetts U.S. District Court announced a Phase II plan requiring 24,000 students to be bused that was formulated by a four-member committee consisting of former Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Justice Jacob Spiegel, former U.S. Education Commissioner Francis Keppel, Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Charles V. Willie, and former Massachusetts Attorney General Edward J. McCormack that was formed by Judge Garrity the previous February. On December 9, Judge Garrity ruled that instead of closing South Boston High at the request of the plaintiffs in &quot;Morgan v. Hennigan&quot;, the school would be put into federal receivership. On June 14, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice Warren E. Burger (1969–1986) unanimously declined to review the School Committee&#x27;s appeal of the Phase II plan. From September 1974 through the fall of 1976, at least 40 riots had occurred in the city.

==Retirement==
She was defeated for reelection to the Boston City Council in 1977, finishing tenth in the race for nine positions. In 1979, Councilor James Michael Connolly was elected Register of Probate for Suffolk County and resigned from the council, and as 10th-place finisher in the 1979 election, Hicks filled the vacant seat only to lose again in 1981. Hicks began to experience health problems and retired from politics after that.

Despite the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977 banning redlining, the legislation was not seriously enforced by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the 1980s during the Reagan Administration while the Department itself was rife with corruption. From July 1977 through June 1978, 91 percent of the government-insured foreclosures in Boston were in Dorchester, Mattapan, and Roxbury, with 53 percent of the city&#x27;s foreclosures in South Dorchester and Mattapan alone, and 84 percent of the 93 foreclosures in Dorchester were concentrated in B-BURG program census tracts. By the early 1990s, the overwhelming majority of Boston&#x27;s 120,000 black residents lived in Dorchester, Roxbury, and Mattapan. In December 1982, Judge Garrity transferred responsibility for monitoring of compliance to the State Board for the subsequent two years, and in September 1985, Judge Garrity issued his final orders returning jurisdiction of the schools to the School Committee. In May 1990, Judge Garrity delivered his final judgment in &quot;Morgan v. Hennigan&quot;, formally closing the original case. Incidents of interracial violence in Boston would continue from November 1977 through at least 1993.

==Death and burial==
Hicks died in Boston on October 21, 2003. She was buried at Saint Joseph Cemetery in West Roxbury, Massachusetts.

<text>Bolton ( , locally ) is a town in Greater Manchester in England. In the foothills of the West Pennine Moors, Bolton is between Manchester, Blackburn, Wigan, Bury and Salford. It is surrounded by several towns and villages that form the wider borough, of which Bolton is the administrative centre. The town is within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire.

A former mill town, Bolton has been a centre for textile production since the 14th century when Flemish weavers settled in the area, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition. It was a 19th-century boomtown, development largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. At its peak in 1929, its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world. The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War and, by the 1980s, cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in the town.

The town has a population of 139,403, whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400. Bolton originated as a small settlement in the moorland known as Bolton le Moors. In the English Civil War, the town was a Parliamentarian outpost in 1644 in a staunchly Royalist region and, as a result, the Royalist Prince Rupert of the Rhine led &quot;the 1644 storming of Bolton&quot; of 3,000 Royalist troops in which is also referred to as &quot;The Bolton Massacre&quot;, with 1,600 residents perished and 700 were taken prisoner.

Bolton Wanderers football club now play home games at the Toughsheet Community Stadium in Horwich. Cultural interests include the Octagon Theatre and the Bolton Museum and Art Gallery, as well as one of the earliest public libraries established after the Public Libraries Act 1850.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Bolton is a common Northern English name derived from the Old English -, meaning a settlement with a dwelling. The first recorded use of the name, in the form &quot;Boelton&quot;, dates from 1185 to describe Bolton le Moors, though this may not be in relation to a dwelling. It was recorded as Bothelton in 1212, Botelton in 1257, Boulton in 1288, and Bolton after 1307.
Later forms of Botheltun were Bodeltown, Botheltun-le-Moors, Bowelton, Boltune, Bolton-super-Moras, Bolton-in-ye-Moors, Bolton-le-Moors.

The town&#x27;s motto of means &quot;overcome difficulties&quot; (or &quot;delays&quot;), and is a pun on the Bolton-super-Moras version of the name meaning literally, &quot;Bolton on the moors&quot;. The name itself is referred to in the badge of the Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council using a form of visual pun, a rebus, in combining motifs of arrow for &#x27;bolt&#x27; and heraldic crown for &#x27;tun&#x27;, the term for the central high point of a defensive position that is the etymon of the suffix of Bolton.

===Early history to the Civil War===
There is evidence of human existence on the moors around Bolton since the early part of the Bronze Age, including a stone circle on Cheetham Close above Egerton, and Bronze Age burial mounds on Winter Hill. A Bronze Age mound was excavated in Victorian times outside Haulgh Hall. The Romans built roads from Manchester to Ribchester to the east and a road along what is now the A6 to the west. It is claimed that Agricola built a fort at Blackrod by clearing land above the forest. Evidence of a Saxon settlement exists in the form of religious objects found when the Victorian parish church was built.

In 1067 Great Bolton was the property of Roger de Poitou and after 1100, of Roger de Meresheys. Bolton became the property of the Pilkington family until they forfeited the land in the Wars of the Roses. The land was given to the Stanley family and thus the Earls of Derby who became royalists in the English Civil War. The area surrounding Bolton was subsequently divided into four parts including the Stanley family, the Earl of Bradford, a Freeman and various other parties. Great Bolton and Little Bolton were part of the Marsey fee, in 1212 Little Bolton was held by Roger de Bolton as plough-land, by the service of the twelfth part of a knight&#x27;s fee to Randle de Marsey. The parish church in Bolton has an early foundation although the exact date is unknown; it was given by the lord of the manor to the Gilbertine canons of Mattersey Priory in Nottinghamshire, founded by Roger de Marsey.

A charter to hold a market in Churchgate was granted on 14 December 1251 by King Henry III of England. Bolton became a market town and borough by a charter from the Earl of Derby, William de Ferrers, on 14 January 1253, and a market was held until the 18th century. Burgage plots were laid out on Churchgate and Deansgate in the centre of the medieval town close to where Ye Olde Man &amp; Scythe public house, dating from 1251, is situated today.
In 1337 Flemish weavers settled and introduced the manufacture of woollen cloth. More Flemish weavers, fleeing the Huguenot persecutions, settled here in the 17th century. The second wave of settlers wove fustian, a rough cloth made of linen and cotton. Digging sea coal was recorded in 1374. There was an outbreak of the plague in the town in 1623.

During the English Civil War, the people of Bolton were Puritans and supported the Parliamentarian cause. A parliamentary garrison in the town was attacked twice without success but on 28 May 1644 Prince Rupert&#x27;s Royalist army with troops under the command of the Earl of Derby attacked again. The attack became known as the Bolton Massacre in which 1,500 died, 700 were taken prisoner and the town plundered. The attackers took to referring to the town as the &quot;Geneva of the North&quot;, referencing Geneva&#x27;s dominant Calvinism, although historian Malcolm Hardman says this was a description borne &quot;more of irritation than accuracy&quot;. At the end of the Civil War, Lord Derby was tried as a traitor at Chester and condemned to death. When his appeal for pardon to parliament was rejected he attempted to escape but was recaptured. For his part in the massacre, he was executed outside Ye Olde Man &amp; Scythe Inn on 15 October 1651.

===Industrial Revolution onward===

Bolton was a 19th-century boomtown and, at its zenith in 1929, its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world. The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War and, by the 1980s, cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton.

A tradition of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, led to rapid growth of the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i&#x27; th&#x27; Wood, invented the spinning mule in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the bleach works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using chlorine was introduced in the 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley. The mule revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright&#x27;s water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves&#x27;s spinning jenny, producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton&#x27;s skyline, some of which survive today.

Growth of the textile industry was assisted by the availability of coal in the area. By 1896 John Fletcher had coal mines at Ladyshore in Little Lever; The Earl of Bradford had a coal mine at Great Lever; the Darcy Lever Coal Company had mines at Darcy Lever and there were coal mines at Tonge, Breightmet, Deane and Doffcocker. Some of these pits were close to the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal providing the owners with markets in Bolton and Manchester. Coal mining declined in the 20th century.

Important transport links contributed to the growth of the town and the textile industry; the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal constructed in 1791, connected the town to Bury and Manchester providing transport for coal and other basic materials. The Bolton and Leigh Railway, the oldest in Lancashire, opened to goods traffic in 1828 and Great Moor Street station opened to passengers in 1831. The railway initially connected Bolton to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Leigh, an important link with the port of Liverpool for the import of raw cotton from America, but was extended in 1829 to link up with the Manchester to Liverpool Line. Local firms built locomotives for the railway, in 1830 &quot;Union&quot; was built by Rothwell, Hick and Company and two locomotives, &quot;Salamander&quot; and &quot;Veteran&quot; were built by Crook and Dean.

Bolton&#x27;s first Mayor, Charles James Darbishire was sympathetic to Chartism and a supporter of the Anti-Corn Law League. In August 1839 Bolton was besieged by Chartist rioters and the Riot Act was read and special constables sworn in. The mayor accompanied soldiers called to rescue special constables at Little Bolton Town Hall, which was besieged by a mob, and the incident ended without bloodshed. Derby Barracks was established in Fletcher Street in the early 1860s.

One of two statues prominent on Victoria Square near Bolton Town Hall is that of Samuel Taylor Chadwick (1809 – 3 May 1876) a philanthropist who donated funds to Bolton Hospital to create an ear, nose and throat ward. Built houses for people living in cellars, through Bolton Council fought for better public health including cleaner water, established the Chadwick Orphanage, improved the Bolton Workhouse and funded the towns natural history museum that was the basis of the present Bolton Museum at Le Mans Crescent, the original museum was in a building at Queens Park. The second statue at Victoria Square is in memory of a former Bolton Mayor Sir Benjamin Alfred Dobson (1847–1898) who died in office in 1898, he was a textile machinery manufacturer and chairman of Dobson &amp; Barlow, a significant employer in the town. By 1900 Bolton was Lancashire&#x27;s third largest engineering centre after Manchester and Oldham. About 9,000 men were employed in the industry, half of them working for Dobson and Barlow in Kay Street.

Another engineering company Hick, Hargreaves &amp; Co based at the Soho Foundry made Lancashire boilers and heavy machinery. Thomas Ryder and Son of Turner Bridge manufactured machine tools for the international motor industry. Wrought iron was produced for more than 100 years at Thomas Walmsley and Sons&#x27; Atlas Forge.

By 1911 the textile industry in Bolton employed about 36,000 people. As of 1920, the Bolton Cardroom Union had more than 15,000 members, while the Bolton Weavers&#x27; Association represented 13,500 workers. The last mill to be constructed was Sir John Holden&#x27;s Mill in 1927. The cotton industry declined from the 1920s. A brief upturn after the Second World War was not sustained, and the industry had virtually vanished by the end of the 20th century.

During the night of 26 September 1916, Bolton was the target for an aerial offensive. L21, a Zeppelin commanded by Oberleutnant Kurt Frankenburg of the Imperial German Navy, dropped twenty-one bombs on the town, five of them on the working class area of Kirk Street, killing thirteen residents and destroying six houses. Further attacks followed on other parts of the town, including three incendiaries dropped close to the Town Hall.

===Lord Leverhulme===
In 1899 William Lever, Lord Leverhulme, bought Hall i&#x27;th&#x27; Wood as a memorial to Samuel Crompton inventor of the spinning mule. Lever restored the dilapidated building and presented it to the town in 1902, having turned it into a museum furnished with household goods typical of domestic family life in the 16th and 17th centuries. Lever re-endowed Bolton Schools, giving land and his house on Chorley New Road. He presented the town with of land for a public park which the corporation named Leverhulme Park in 1914. In 1902 he gave the people of Bolton Lever Park at Rivington. In 1911, Lever consulted Thomas Mawson, landscape architect and lecturer in Landscape Design at the University of Liverpool, regarding town planning in Bolton. Mawson published &quot;Bolton – a Study in Town Planning and Civic Art&quot; and gave lectures entitled &quot;Bolton Housing and Town Planning Society&quot; which formed the basis of an illustrated book &quot;Bolton – as it is and as it might be&quot;. In 1924, Leverhulme presented Bolton Council with an ambitious plan to rebuild the town centre based on Mawson&#x27;s designs funded partly by himself. The council declined in favour of extending the town hall and building the civic centre.

==Governance==

Lying within the county boundaries of Lancashire, until the early 19th century, Great Bolton and Little Bolton were two of the eighteen townships of the ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors. These townships were separated by the River Croal, Little Bolton on the north bank and Great Bolton on the south. Bolton Poor Law Union was formed on 1 February 1837. It continued using existing poorhouses at Fletcher Street and Turton but in 1856 started to build a new workhouse at Fishpool Farm in Farnworth. Townleys Hospital was built on the site which is now Royal Bolton Hospital.

In 1838 Great Bolton, most of Little Bolton and the Haulgh area of Tonge with Haulgh were incorporated under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 as a municipal borough, the second to be created in England. Further additions were made adding part of Rumworth in 1872 and part of Halliwell in 1877. In 1889 Bolton was granted County Borough status and became self-governing and independent from Lancashire County Council jurisdiction. In 1898, the borough was extended further by adding the civil parishes of Breightmet, Darcy Lever, Great Lever, the rest of Halliwell, Heaton, Lostock, Middle Hulton, the rest of Rumworth which had been renamed Deane in 1894, Smithills, and Tonge plus Astley Bridge Urban District, and part of Over Hulton civil parish. The County Borough of Bolton was abolished in 1974 and became a constituent part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester. Bolton unsuccessfully applied for city status in 2011.

Bolton Council is divided into twenty wards, each of which elects three councillors for a term of up to four years.

Under the Reform Act of 1832, a Parliamentary Borough was established. The Bolton constituency was represented by two Members of Parliament (MPs). The Parliamentary Borough continued until 1950 when it was abolished and replaced with two parliamentary constituencies, Bolton East and Bolton West, each with one Member of Parliament. In 1983 Bolton East was abolished and two new constituencies were created, Bolton North East, and Bolton South East covering most of the former Farnworth constituency. At the same time major boundary changes also took place to Bolton West, which took over most of the former Westhoughton constituency. Under the town twinning scheme the local council have twinned Bolton with Le Mans in France, since 1967, and Paderborn in Germany, since 1975.

It is surrounded by several neighbouring towns and villages that together form the Borough of Bolton, of which Bolton is the administrative centre. The town of Bolton has a population of 139,403, whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400.

==Geography==
Close to the West Pennine Moors, Bolton is north-west of Manchester.

The early name, Bolton le Moors, described the position of the town amid the low hills on the edge of the West Pennine Moors southeast of Rivington Pike (456 m). Bolton lies on relatively flat land on both sides of the clough or steep-banked valley through which the River Croal flows in a southeasterly direction towards the River Irwell. The geological formation around Bolton consists of sandstones of the Carboniferous series and Coal Measures; in the northern part of Bolton the lower Coal Measures are mixed with underlying Millstone Grit.

Climate in the Greater Manchester area is generally similar to the climate of England, although owing to protection from the mountains in North Wales it experiences slightly lower than average rainfall except during the summer months, when rainfall is higher than average. Bolton has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

==Demography==

At the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics, the Urban Subdivision of Bolton was part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area and had a total resident population of 139,403, of which 67,823 (48.7%) were male and 71,580 (51.3%) were female, living in 57,827 households. The settlement occupied , compared with in the 1991 census, though the 2001 Urban census area contains a large rural area to the south of the town. Its population density was 31.35 people per hectare compared with an average of 40.20 across the Greater Manchester Urban Area. The median age of the population was 35, compared with 36 within the Greater Manchester Urban Area and 37 across England and Wales.

The majority of the population of Bolton were born in England (87.10%); 2.05% were born elsewhere within the United Kingdom, 1.45% within the rest of the European Union, and 9.38% elsewhere in the world.

Data on religious beliefs across the town in the 2001 census show that 67.9% declared themselves to be Christian, 12.5% stated that they were Muslim, 8.6% said they held no religion, and 3.4% reported themselves as Hindu.

===Population change===

==Economy==
At the time of the 2001 Census, 56,390 people resident in Bolton were in employment. Of these, 21.13% worked in the wholesale and retail trade, including repair of motor vehicles; 18.71% worked within manufacturing industry; 11.00% worked within the health and social work sector and 6.81% were employed in the transport, storage and communication industries.

In the last quarter of the 20th century heavy industry was replaced by service-based activities including data processing, call centres, hi-tech electronics and IT companies. The town retains some traditional industries employing people in paper-manufacturing, packaging, textiles, transportation, steel foundries and building materials. Missiles were produced at the British Aerospace (BAe) factory in Lostock, now closed. The Reebok brand&#x27;s European headquarters are located at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton is also the home of the family bakery, Warburtons, established in 1876 on Blackburn Road. On 13 February 2003, Bolton was granted Fairtrade Town status.

Bolton attracts visitors to its shopping centres, markets, public houses, restaurants and cafes in the town centre
as well retail parks and leisure facilities close to the town centre and in the surrounding towns and suburbs. Tourism plays a part in the economy, visitor attractions include Hall i&#x27; th&#x27; Wood, Smithills Hall and Country Park, Last Drop Village, Barrow Bridge and the Bolton Steam Museum.

There are several regeneration projects planned for Bolton over the next ten years, including Church Wharf by Ask Developments and Bluemantle and Merchant&#x27;s Quarter by local developer Charles Topham group, which together will contribute of business space. The Bolton Innovation Zone is a large £300 million development with the University of Bolton at its core. Bolton is pursuing major redevelopment projects in its town centre, including the regeneration of Crompton Place and Church Wharf areas, aimed at promoting residential, commercial, and leisure spaces.

==Landmarks==
Situated in the town centre on the site of a former market is the Grade II* listed town hall, an imposing neoclassical building designed by William Hill and opened in June 1873 by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. In the 1930s the building was extended by Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope. Within the Town Hall are the &#x27;Albert Halls and several function rooms. The original, single Albert Hall was destroyed by fire on 14 November 1981. After rebuilding work, it was replaced by the present Albert Halls, which were opened in 1985. The halls underwent a major restoration project, reopening in 2017.

The Great Hall of Smithills Hall was built in the 14th century when William de Radcliffe received the Manor of Smithills from the Hultons, the chapel dates from the 16th century and was extended during the 19th. Smithills Hall was where, in 1555, George Marsh was tried for heresy during the Marian Persecutions. After being &quot;examined&quot; at Smithills, according to local tradition, George Marsh stamped his foot so hard to re-affirm his faith, that a footprint was left in the stone floor. It is a Grade I listed building and is now a museum.

Hall i&#x27; th&#x27; Wood, now a museum, is a late mediaeval yeoman farmer&#x27;s house built by Laurence Brownlow. Around 1637 it was owned by the Norris family, who added the stone west wing. In the 18th century it was divided up into tenements. Samuel Crompton lived and worked there. In the 19th century it deteriorated further until in 1895 it was bought by industrialist William Hesketh Lever, who restored it and presented it to Bolton Council in 1900.

==Education==

Bolton School, a private day school, was founded on a site next to the parish church in 1524 as a grammar school for boys; it merged around 1656 with a free grammar school (Lever&#x27;s grammar) that had been founded shortly after 1641. In 1898, it moved to its present site in Chorley New Road, and in 1913 merged with Bolton Girls&#x27; Day School. In 1855 the Bolton Church Institute was founded by Canon James Slade near to the parish church. The school became Canon Slade School, which has since relocated to Bradshaw. The town&#x27;s other secondary schools include Bolton St Catherine&#x27;s Academy, Ladybridge High School, Rivington and Blackrod High School, Sharples School, Smithills School, Thornleigh Salesian College, and University Collegiate School.

==Religion==


There is evidence from Saxon times of Christian churches and at the time of the Civil War a Puritan and nonconformist presence in the town. The Unitarians were among the early dissenting congregations which eventually included Methodists, Baptists, Seventh Day Adventist and other denominations. More than forty churches were built during the Victorian era, but some have now been closed, demolished or converted to other uses.

Today, the parish of Bolton-le-Moors covers a small area in the town centre, but until the 19th century it covered a much larger area, divided into eighteen chapelries and townships. The neighbouring ancient parish of Deane centred around St Mary&#x27;s Church once covered a large area to the west and south of Bolton, and the township of Great Lever was part of the ancient parish of Middleton.

The Church of St Peter, commonly known as Bolton Parish Church, is an example of the gothic revival style. Built between 1866 and 1871 of Longridge stone to designs by Paley, the church is in width, in length, and in height. The tower is high with 13 bells. The first church on the same site was built in Anglo-Saxon times. It was rebuilt in Norman times and again in the early 15th century. Little is known of the first two earlier churches, but the third building was a solid, squat building with a sturdy square tower at the west end. It was modified over the years until it fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1866. Fragments of stone and other artefacts from these first three buildings are displayed in the museum corner of the present church.

St Mary&#x27;s Deane, once the only church in a parish of ten townships in the hundred of Salford, is a church established in Saxon times. The current building dates from 1250 with extensions and restoration in the 19th century and is a Grade II* listed building.

St George&#x27;s Church was built between 1794 and 1796 when Little Bolton was a separate township. Built by Peter Rothwell and paid for by the Ainsworth family. in 1975 it was leased to Bolton Council, and became a craft centre in 1994. St Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church on Great Moor Street, was built in 1861.

The New Zakaria Mosque, the first mosque in Bolton, served the Muslim community from Pakistan and India from the 1960s. The first place of worship for Hindus was in the former St Barnabas Church, converted into a Hindu temple.

<doc id="352419" wikidata="Q2842324" url="?curid=352419" title="TRAC (programming language)">
<text>TRAC (for Text Reckoning And Compiling) Language is a programming language developed between 1959–1964 by Calvin Mooers and first implemented on the PDP-1 in 1964 by L. Peter Deutsch. It was one of three &quot;first languages&quot; recommended by Ted Nelson in &quot;Computer Lib&quot;. TRAC T64 was used until at least 1984, when Mooers updated it to TRAC T84.

== Language description ==
TRAC is a purely text-based language — a kind of macro language. Unlike traditional &quot;ad hoc&quot; macro languages of the time, such as those found in assemblers, TRAC is well planned, consistent, and in many senses complete. It has explicit input and output operators, unlike the typical implicit I/O at the outermost macro level, which makes it simultaneously simpler and more versatile than older macro languages.

TRAC is a text-processing language,
also called a string processing language.
Because of this the only data type available is a string of characters. Numbers are strings of digits, with integer arithmetic (without specific limits on maximum values) being provided through built-in (&quot;primitive&quot;) functions which operate on their string representation. Arguably, one aspect of its completeness is that the concept of an error is limited to events like lack of file space and requesting expansion of a string longer than the interpreter&#x27;s working storage; what would in many languages be described as illegal operations are dealt with in TRAC by defining a result (often a null string) for every possible combination of a function&#x27;s argument strings.

TRAC is, like APL or LISP, an expression oriented language (in contrast to more typical procedure-oriented languages) but, unlike APL, it completely lacks operators. In most respects, it is a case of pure functional programming. It has, in common with LISP, a syntax that generally involves the presence of many levels of nested parentheses.

TRAC is homoiconic: that is, a TRAC program can be represented and manipulated within the TRAC language itself.
The emphasis on strings as the single data type is so strong that TRAC provides mechanisms for handling the language&#x27;s own syntactic characters either in their syntactic roles or like any other character, and self-modifying code has more the feel of a natural consequence of typical TRAC programming techniques than of being a special feature.

The main inspiration for TRAC came from three papers by Douglas McIlroy.

== Intellectual property ==
Mooers trademarked the name TRAC in an effort to maintain his control over the definition of the language, an unusual and pioneering action at the time. At one point, he brought an intellectual property infringement suit against DEC, alleging that a contract to deliver a mini-computer with a TRAC interpreter violated his rights. &quot;The first issue of Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal, one of the early publications in the personal computer field, has a vitriolic editorial against Mooers and his rapacity in trying to charge people for his computing language.&quot; 
The name has since been used several times for unrelated information technology projects, including a current open source project management system called Trac.

== Influence and usage ==
TRAC was later implemented on the PDP-8, PDP-10, and PDP-11.

There have been various languages inspired by TRAC. To avoid any trouble with Mooers, they renamed primitives and/or used different metacharacters. In SAM76&#x27;s case, primitives were added, according to Claude Kagan, &quot;because TRAC is baby talk&quot;. In MINT&#x27;s case, primitives were added to give access to a sophisticated text editor machinery.
* one perceived shortcoming of TRAC was lack of full extensibility: some TRAC primitive functions are sensitive to the distinction between a null (zero-character) argument and a nonexistent (non-delimited) one, but beyond its last non-null argument, a user-defined function cannot make the distinction. SAM76 was a TRAC-like language which eliminated that limitation. 
* Russ Nelson implemented an emacs extension language named MINT (MINT Is Not TRAC). This language is used by the FreeDOS editor FreeMACS.
* John Walker implemented an embeddable extension language library DIESEL (Dumb Interpretively Evaluated String Expression Language) originally for menu macro processing in AutoCAD.

TRAC was used by FTP Software in its PC/TCP product as the modem dialer scripting language.

TRAC was also used as a front end on Digital Productions Cray renderer for films, including &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;.

== Example program ==

This is an example of a simple program that asks the user&#x27;s name and exits, written in TRAC T64:

TRAC T84 uses a slightly different syntax and different names for its primitives. The following is a script to compute Fibonacci numbers, written in TRAC T84:

<text>Alliance Atlantis Communications Inc. (commonly known as Alliance Atlantis and commonly shortened to simply Alliance or Atlantis) was a Canadian media company that operated primarily as a specialty service operator in Canada. Alliance Atlantis also had offices in Halifax, Los Angeles, London, Dublin, Madrid, Barcelona, Shannon, and Sydney.

Alliance Atlantis was the result of a merger of two companies: [[Atlantis Communications]], founded in 1978 by Michael MacMillan, Janice L. Platt and Seaton S. MacLean, and [[Alliance Films|Alliance Communications]], founded in 1984 by Stephen Roth, Denis Héroux, John Kemeny, Robert Lantos, Andras Hamori and Susan Cavan as Alliance Entertainment. Alliance Communications and Atlantis Communications merged to form Alliance Atlantis in 1998 which was a member of the North American Broadcasting Association (NABA).

The company ceased to exist in 2007 as the broadcasting division was acquired by Canwest Global Communications and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs that year. The motion picture division was then spun off and operated independently as Alliance Films, headquartered in Montreal (subsequently sold to Entertainment One and later, Lionsgate), and the international television distribution division was sold to Echo Bridge Entertainment.

All of the former Alliance Atlantis specialty networks, except for the now-defunct BBC Kids, are now owned by Corus Entertainment. The films division was later acquired by Entertainment One group and folded into eOne on January 9, 2013. Most of the assets of eOne, which included Alliance Atlantis&#x27; films division and television library, were later acquired by Lionsgate on December 27, 2023.

The Alliance name survived under the Alliance Cinemas banner until January 1, 2021; the theaters under the chain are now owned by Cineplex Entertainment.

==Formation and history==
Alliance Atlantis was formed in 1998 from the merger of two former production companies, Alliance Communications (founded in 1984) and Atlantis Communications (founded in 1978). As President and Board Director of the subsequent combined Alliance Atlantis, Lewis Rose was responsible for leading the teams which arranged the merger financing of $545 million and which achieved in excess of $20 million in savings and synergies from the combination of the two companies in the year following the merger. (The merger was also parodied on &quot;Made in Canada&quot;, when that show&#x27;s Pyramid Productions merged with a company called Prodigy.) After the merger, the company laid off 15% of their staff (much of them from pre-merger Aliiance), and closed the former Atlantis sales office in Amsterdam. As part of the merger deal, Robert Lantos, founder of Alliance, signed a deal for film and TV production with Alliance Atlantis through his own firm, Serendipity Point Films.

At the time of the merger, both companies had launched various Canadian specialty television services; in 1995, Alliance launched Showcase Television while Atlantis launched Life Network (which has since been renamed &quot;Slice&quot;); in fall 1997 the companies launched History Television and HGTV Canada respectively. Earlier that year, Alliance Atlantis teamed up with Hallmark Cards to create Crayola Kids Adventures, a series of three direct-to-video adaptations of well-known children&#x27;s novels. Atlantis had also been a major investor in YTV in its first few years before selling out to Shaw Communications and later, Corus Entertainment from 1999.

In 1998, the company purchased 75% of Cineplex Odeon Films. In 1999, German Kinowelt purchased an interest in Alliance Atlantis&#x27; UK distribution arm, which was soon renamed to Momentum Pictures in 2000. Also that year, the company secured the Canadian rights to distribute features by Destination Films. Also in 2000, it purchased the rights to &quot;&quot; from Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Television. Another major deal in 2000 was a renewal of their distribution pact with Artisan Entertainment, including Canadian distribution of Artisan material, and UK theatrical distribution of Artisan films via Momentum Pictures.

The company expanded its business with its launch of its children&#x27;s production label AAC Kids in 1999, and its nonfiction production label, AAC Fact in 2000. These labels were dissolved in 2003.

In 2000, AAC Kids signed a European co-financing and distribution deal with German studio TV-Loonland AG. The distribution deal was valued at $14 million.

In 2001, the company purchased Salter Street Films, which produced a number of television shows for both the Canadian and international market. However, soon after the acquisition, Salter Street was disbanded and its active projects were transferred to Alliance Atlantis&#x27; own television production/development division.

Citing lower profits, Alliance Atlantis later closed the majority of its production arm, aside from the highly profitable &quot;&quot; family of series, which it co-produces with CBS Television Studios. It briefly maintained Salter Street&#x27;s long-running &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; before transferring the show to the Halifax Film Company, made up of former Salter Street employees. Its primary business became its ownership of a number of Canadian specialty services, which, in addition to those listed above, later included Food Network, Discovery Health (now FYI Canada), BBC Canada, BBC Kids and more.

Throughout the years, the company had purchased assets of several bankrupt studios, including Norstar Entertainment, Telescene, Peace Arch, Cinemavault, Odeon Films and in 2005, had bought out the television library of Fireworks Distributing Corporation from CanWest Global Communications.

In 2007, Alliance Atlantis was named one of Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers, as published in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine, the only broadcaster to be included on the list.

==Sale to CanWest / Goldman Sachs==
On December 20, 2006, the company announced that it was &quot;exploring strategic alternatives&quot;, effectively putting the company up for sale. Expected bidders included Canwest Global, Corus Entertainment, Astral Media, and Rogers Communications. The rights to &quot;CSI&quot; were expected to be sold separately, with CBS Paramount Television as the most likely bidder. A similar announcement was made previously regarding the Motion Picture Distribution unit, which is also expected to be sold separately while finding a bidder to acquire most parts of the company.

On January 10, 2007, it was announced that Alliance Atlantis would be acquired by a consortium of Canwest Global and GS Capital Partners, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs.

*The Entertainment and Production division, consisting mainly of AAC&#x27;s 50% stake in the lucrative &quot;CSI&quot; franchise, was acquired by GS Capital Partners. CBS Paramount TV gained Alliance Atlantis&#x27; international distribution rights to the programs.
**Alliance Atlantis&#x27; international television distribution operations were sold by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners to Echo Bridge Entertainment.
*Motion Picture Distribution LP, including its publicly traded income fund, was acquired by Canada-based EdgeStone Capital Partners and GS Capital Partners. On January 15, 2008, Edgemont&#x27;s 51% voting stake (and 38.5% equity stake) in the Alliance label was purchased by Société générale de financement du Québec, an investment agency of the provincial government. Since the breakup, the company&#x27;s films have been distributed under the &quot;Alliance&quot; banner for English-language releases and &quot;Alliance Vivafilm&quot; for French-language releases until the sale of the company to eOne.
*The Broadcasting division was jointly acquired by Canwest and GS Capital Partners, with the former owning a majority voting interest and the latter a majority of the equity. Canwest owns 66.67% and GS owns 33.32% of CW Media, the holding company for the former AAC channels. Initially, Canwest still managed the channels it owned before the merger separately. It was expected that the Canwest and CW Media broadcasting divisions would eventually be merged, potentially also giving GS a sizable interest in Global and other Canwest channels (these plans became moot after Canwest&#x27;s creditor protection filings).

===Ramifications===
Following Canwest seeking creditor protection in late 2009, Shaw Communications subsequently took over most of Alliance Atlantis&#x27;s former broadcasting assets as of October 27, 2010. after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22. Alliance Atlantis (CW Media) became part of the Shaw Media division. Corus Entertainment acquired Shaw Media on April 1, 2016.

Entertainment One would later acquire Alliance Films on January 9, 2013, and all of their subsidiaries from Goldman Sachs Group, similar to the purchase of Maple Pictures a year prior. eOne subsequently adopted the 2004 Alliance Atlantis fanfare, still in use by Alliance Films, for their own logo. On November 20, 2014, Echo Bridge Entertainment sold Alliance Atlantis&#x27; children&#x27;s programs, including the international distribution rights to the &quot;Degrassi&quot; franchise, to DHX Media. In 2017, producer Steven Paul announced that he would acquire the non-family assets of Echo Bridge Entertainment, including the international distribution rights to Alliance Atlantis&#x27; library (with the exception of its children&#x27;s programs that are still owned by DHX Media/WildBrain) and later folded it into SP Releasing, in turn licensed most of Alliance Atlantis, Cineplex Odeon Films, Echo Bridge and PM Entertainment libraries to FilmRise for digital distribution and online streaming. eOne in turn was acquired by U.S. toy maker Hasbro in 2019. On August 3, 2023, Hasbro announced that it would sell most of eOne&#x27;s assets, including the copyrights and Canadian distribution rights to the library of Alliance Atlantis, to Lionsgate (which Hasbro attempted to acquire in 2017). The deal closed on December 27, 2023.

==Alliance Films==
Alliance Films was a major motion picture distribution/production company which serves Canada, the United Kingdom, and Spain. Formally known as Motion Picture Distribution LP, it was re branded and relaunched in 2007 due to the break-up of its preceding company, Alliance Atlantis, which was sold off piece by piece to Canwest Global, GS Capital Partners, along with several other smaller companies. Alliance Atlantis and Vivafilm home video releases were manufactured and distributed by NBCUniversal&#x27;s Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

Entertainment One (eOne) later acquired Alliance Films on January 9, 2013, for $225 million and merged Alliance Films and all of their subsidiaries under the latter brand. Most of the assets of eOne, as well as Alliance Films libraries was subsequently bought by Lionsgate in late 2023.

<text>Phyllis Virginia &quot;Bebe&quot; () Daniels (January 14, 1901 – March 16, 1971) was an American actress, singer, dancer, writer, and producer.

She began her career in Hollywood during the silent film era as a child actress, became a star in musicals such as &quot;Rio Rita&quot;, and later gained fame on radio and television in Britain. Over the course of her 50-year career, Daniels appeared in 230 films.

==Early life and career==
Daniels was born Phyllis Virginia Daniels (Bebe was a childhood nickname) in Dallas, Texas in 1901. Her father was a travelling theater manager, Scottish-born Melville Daniel MacNeal, who changed his name to Danny Daniels after a disagreement with his father over his ambition to change from the medical profession to show business. Her mother was Phyllis de Forest Griffin, born in Colombia of an American father and a Colombian mother, a stage actress who was in Danny&#x27;s travelling stock company when their child was born. When she was ten weeks old, her father proudly carried her on stage when there was no part in the play for a baby. 

The family moved to Los Angeles in her childhood, and she began her acting career at the age of 4 in the first version of &quot;The Squaw Man (play)&quot;. The same year, she went on tour in a stage production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. The following year, she participated in productions by Oliver Morosco and David Belasco.

By the age of 7, Daniels had her first starring role in film as the young heroine in &quot;A Common Enemy&quot;. At the age of 9, she starred as Dorothy Gale in the 1910 short film &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. At the age of 14, she was hired by comedy producer Hal Roach at $5 per day to star with Roach&#x27;s star comedian Harold Lloyd in a series of one-reel comedies, starting with the 1915 film &quot;Giving Them Fits&quot;. Lloyd and Daniels eventually developed a romantic relationship that was well publicized; they were known in Hollywood as &quot;The Boy&quot; and &quot;The Girl&quot;.

In 1919, she declined to renew her contract with Hal Roach because she wanted to be a dramatic actress. She accepted an offer from producer-director Cecil B. DeMille, who gave her secondary roles in &quot;Male and Female&quot; (1919), &quot;Why Change Your Wife?&quot; (1920), and &quot;The Affairs of Anatol&quot; (1921).

==Hollywood career==
In the 1920s, Daniels was under contract with Paramount Pictures. She made the transition from child star to adult in Hollywood in 1922, and by 1924, she was acting with Rudolph Valentino in &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot;. Following this movie, she was cast in a number of light popular films, namely &quot;Miss Bluebeard&quot;, &quot;The Manicure Girl&quot;, and &quot;Wild Wild Susan&quot;. Paramount dropped her contract with the advent of sound movies. Daniels was hired by the new studio Radio Pictures (later known as RKO Radio) to star in its first feature, the Technicolor musical &quot;Rio Rita&quot;, co-starring the comedy team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. &quot;Rio Rita&quot; turned out not to be RKO&#x27;s inaugural film due to production delays, but it was still one of the more successful films of that year. Bebe Daniels became established as a musical star, and RCA Victor hired her to record several records for its catalog.

Radio Pictures starred her in a number of musicals, including &quot;Dixiana&quot; (1930) and &quot;Love Comes Along&quot; (1930). Toward the end of 1930, Daniels appeared in the musical comedy &quot;Reaching for the Moon&quot;, released through United Artists. However, by this time, musicals had gone out of fashion, and most of the musical numbers from the film had to be removed before it could be released. Daniels had become associated with musicals, and Radio Pictures did not renew her contract. Warner Bros. realized she was a box-office draw, and she was offered a contract. During her years at Warner Bros., she starred in &quot;My Past&quot; (1931), &quot;Honor of the Family&quot; (1931), and the 1931 pre-code version of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. In 1932, she appeared in &quot;Silver Dollar&quot; (1932) and the successful Busby Berkeley choreographed musical comedy &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1933) in which she sang. The same year, she played in &quot;Counsellor at Law&quot;. Her last film for Warner Bros. was &quot;Registered Nurse&quot; (1934).

==Stalking incidents==

In 1934, Daniels and husband Ben Lyon, whom she had married in June 1930, garnered press attention while having to testify against Albert F. Holland, a 36-year-old World War I veteran with a history of stalking Daniels. Holland had been under the delusion that he had attended school with Daniels and that they had married in Mexico in 1925. In 1931, he broke into Daniels&#x27; hotel room in San Francisco, confronting and terrifying her, and he had to be removed by security. He was arrested and committed to the Arizona State Asylum. Holland escaped from the institution in 1932, and he began sending more than 150 threatening letters to Daniels. Arrested again, he was placed in a psychiatric institution. 

Following his release, another confrontation took place, and Holland was again arrested. A lengthy trial in Los Angeles took place, with Holland conducting most of his own defense, including a lengthy cross-examination of Daniels&#x27; husband Ben Lyon. Actress Doris Kenyon, a friend of Daniels and Lyon, testified for the prosecution. Ultimately, the jury found Holland to be mentally unfit, and he was committed to a psychiatric facility for an indefinite period. Daniels and Lyon then moved to London.

==Career in London and later==
Daniels retired from Hollywood in 1935 with her husband, film actor Ben Lyon, and their two children, and moved to London. In February 1939, Daniels and Lyon co-starred in a series of commercial radio shows, the &quot;Rinso Radio Revue&quot;, recorded in London for Radio Luxembourg. They and Bebe&#x27;s mother Phyllis all returned to the U.S. on 14 June 1939, leaving their children in Los Angeles in the care of Phyllis, and returned to London seven weeks later. After the start of World War II, they worked for the BBC, starring in the comedy radio series &quot;Hi Gang!&quot;. Born from an idea by Ben, and with most of the dialogue by Bebe, it enjoyed considerable popularity. A few years later, Daniels starred in the London production of &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; in the title role. The couple remained in England through the days of The Blitz.

Following the war, Daniels was awarded the Medal of Freedom by Harry S Truman for war service. In 1945, she returned to Hollywood for a short time to work as a film producer for Hal Roach and Eagle-Lion Films. She returned to the UK in 1948 and lived there for the remainder of her life. Daniels, her husband, her son Richard and her daughter Barbara all starred in the radio sitcom &quot;Life with the Lyons&quot; (1951 to 1961), which later made the transition to television.

==Personal life==
Daniels married actor Ben Lyon in June 1930. They had two children: daughter Barbara in 1931 and a son Richard (born Bryan Moore in 1935), whom they adopted from a London orphanage. In an issue of the contemporary magazine &quot;Radio Pictorial&quot;, she explained how she saw Richard peering through the railings and instantly thought &quot;A brother for Barbara&quot;.

Daniels suffered a severe stroke in 1963 and withdrew from public life. She suffered a second stroke in late 1970. On March 16, 1971, Daniels died of a cerebral hemorrhage in London at the age of 70. Daniels&#x27; death came only nine days after her former co-star Harold Lloyd died. Her remains were cremated at London&#x27;s Golders Green Crematorium and the ashes returned to the United States; she was interred at the Chapel Columbarium at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Upon his death in 1979, Ben Lyon&#x27;s remains were interred next to Daniels&#x27;.

<doc id="352428" wikidata="Q671034" url="?curid=352428" title="High Barnet tube station">
<text>High Barnet is a London Underground station, and former railway station, located in Chipping Barnet, North London. The station is the northern terminus of the High Barnet branch of the Northern line and is in Travelcard Zone 5. It is situated 10.2 miles (16.4 km) north north-west of Charing Cross. The next station south is Totteridge &amp; Whetstone.

==Services==

Northern line trains are scheduled to arrive and depart every 3–9 minutes from the station&#x27;s three southbound platforms, with trains operating to Morden via Bank or to Kennington, Battersea Power Station or Morden via Charing Cross.

On days when Night Tube service is not running, between about 00:00 and 01:00, departing trains run as far as East Finchley only, from where journeys to central London can be continued by night bus N20, which also serves High Barnet station itself.

When trains are no longer required to run on the Northern line, they may be stabled on the sidings to the east of the station.

===Connections===
London Buses routes 34, 107, 184, 234, 263, 307, 326, 383, 384, 389, school routes 606, 626, 634 and night route N20 serve the station.

==History==

High Barnet station was planned by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&amp;LR) and was originally opened on 1 April 1872 by the Great Northern Railway (which had taken over the EH&amp;LR) on the original site of the Barnet Faire. It was the terminus of the branch of a line that ran from Finsbury Park to Edgware via Highgate.

After the Railways Act 1921 created the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies the line was, from 1923, part of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER). The section of the High Barnet branch north of East Finchley was incorporated into the London Underground network through the &quot;Northern Heights&quot; project begun in the late 1930s. High Barnet station was first served by Northern line trains on 14 April 1940 and, after a period where the station was served by both operators, LNER services ended in 1941. British Railways (the successor to the LNER) freight trains continued to serve the station&#x27;s goods yard until 1 October 1962, when it was closed.

The station still retains much of its original Victorian architectural character today, with numerous platform buildings dating from the pre-London Transport era.

In 2008, a new train crew accommodation block was constructed immediately to the south west of the station on part of the car park. This was opened on 31 January 2010.

Also, further improvements have been introduced: A new covered step-free entrance from the car park to platform one is now available, along with a ramp at the end of the platform connecting it to platforms two and three. There are also two accessible toilets now available. These works were fully completed in October 2009. Therefore, there is full step-free access coverage in the station, although a considerably steep path to the station still exists if approaching from the north and a steep approach from the road to station level from the south also remains.

<text>Thurso ( ; , ) is a town and former burgh on the north coast of the Highland council area of Scotland. Situated in the historical County of Caithness, it is the northernmost town on the island of Great Britain. From a latitudinal standpoint, Thurso is located more than north of London and further north than the southernmost point of Norway. 

It lies at the junction of the north–south A9 road and the west–east A836 road, connected to Bridge of Forss in the west and Castletown in the east. The River Thurso flows through the town and into Thurso Bay and the Pentland Firth. The river estuary serves as a small harbour. At the 2011 Census, Thurso had a population of 7,933. The population of the larger Thurso civil parish including the town and the surrounding countryside was estimated to be 12,057 in 2021.

Thurso functioned as an important Norse port, and later traded with ports throughout northern Europe until the 19th century.
A thriving fishing centre, Thurso also had a reputation for its linen-cloth and tanning activities. , the Dounreay Nuclear Research Establishment, although mostly decommissioned at the end of the 20th century, employs a significant number of the local population. The Category-A listed ruined Old St Peter&#x27;s Church (St. Peter&#x27;s Kirk) is one of the oldest churches in Scotland, dating to at least 1125. The current church, St Andrew&#x27;s and St Peter&#x27;s, was built in 1832 to a design by William Burn in the Gothic style.

The town contains the main campus of North Highland College and Thurso High School, the northernmost secondary school on the British mainland, which was established in 1958. Thurso Castle, built in 1872, is in ruins. Thurso is home to the football team Thurso FC, established in 1998, who play in the North Caledonian League, and the rugby teams Caithness Crushers and Caithness RFC.

Thurso railway station, opened in 1874, is the most northern station in the United Kingdom. The nearby port of Scrabster provides ferry services to the Orkney Islands; the NorthLink ferry () operates between Scrabster and Stromness.

==Etymology==
Originally Thurso was known by the Celtic name of meaning &quot;bull water&quot; or &quot;bull river&quot;; similarly Dunnet Head was standing for &quot;bull fort&quot; and the name of the town name may have its roots there. Norse influence translated its name to , then altered it to , based on the deity of Thor and translating as (the place on) Thor&#x27;s River.

The local Scots name, , derives from the Norse, as does the modern Scottish Gaelic . means a river mouth, and is generally found as &quot;Inver&quot; in many anglicised names.

==History==
Thurso&#x27;s history stretches back to at least the era of Norse Orcadian rule in Caithness, which ended conclusively in 1266. Neolithic horned cairns found on nearby Shebster Hill, which were used for burials and rituals, date back about 5,000 years. The town was an important Norse port, and has a later history of trade with ports throughout northern Europe until the 19th century. In 1330 Scotland&#x27;s standard unit of weight was brought in line with that of Thurso at the decree of King David II of Scotland, a measure of the town&#x27;s economic importance. Old St Peter&#x27;s Kirk is said to date from circa 1220 and the time of Caithness Bishop Gilbert Murray, who died in 1245.

In 1649, Gaels from Ireland, led by Donald Macalister Mullach, attacked Thurso and were chased off by the residents, headed by Sir James Sinclair. One of the locals, a servant of Sinclair was said to have killed Mullach by &quot;cutting a button from his master&#x27;s coat and firing it from a musket&quot;. In 1811, the parish had 592 houses with a population of 3,462. This had decreased to 2,510 people by 1841. Following the passage into law of the 1845 Poor Law Act, a combination poorhouse was constructed; work commenced in 1854 and was completed by 1856. The building, which had a capacity to house 149 inmates, was on a site to the west of Thurso Road and provided poor relief for Thurso and the parishes of Bower, Canisbay, Dunnet, Halkirk, Olrig, Reay and Watten. Many of the poorhouses in Scotland were under used, and by 1924 the building had been unoccupied for several years so was sold; it was later utilised as housing but by 2001 was again abandoned.

Much of the town is a planned 19th-century development. In 1906, a new Royal National Lifeboat Institution boathouse and slipway was inaugurated near Scrabster Harbour. A fire on 10 December 1956 destroyed the building and its 47ft Watson-class lifeboat and a new building and boat was built, launched the following year. A new lifeboat, named &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; was inaugurated in 1971 by the Queen Mother. A major expansion occurred in the mid-20th century when the Dounreay nuclear power plant was established at Dounreay in 1955, to the west of the town. The arrival of workers related to the power station caused a three-fold increase in the population of Thurso; the 1951 census gave a figure of 3,000 but this had swelled to 9,000 by 1971. This led to around 1,700 new houses being built in Thurso and nearby Castletown, a mixture of local authority housing blended with private houses and flats built by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Decommissioned at the end of the 20th century, it is estimated the site will not be cleared of all the waste until the 2070s, so will continue to provide employment.

Thurso is also the name of the viscountcy held by the Sinclair family in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Thurso hosted the National Mòd in 2010, which was the first time this festival of Gaelic language and culture had been held so far north.

===Governance===
Thurso has history as a burgh of barony dating from 1633 when it was established by Charles I. From 1870, the burgh council was based at Thurso Town Hall. In 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, the local government burgh was merged into the Caithness district of the two-tier Highland region. In 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, the district was abolished and the region became a unitary council area. From 1996 until 2007, the town of Thurso was covered by two or three wards, each electing one councillor by the first-past-the-post system of election. In 2007, a single Thurso ward was created to elect three councillors by the single transferable vote system. In 2017 the Thurso ward was absorbed into a new multi member ward along with the Western portion of Landward Caithness, the new ward, named Thurso and Northwest Caithness, was contested for the first time in the Highland Council election of 2017. The incumbent councillors are Cllr Matthew Reiss (Independent), Provost Struan Mackie (Scottish Conservative), Cllr Ron Gunn (Scottish Liberal Democrats) and Cllr Karl Rosie (Scottish National Party).

Electing four members to the new ward, it is one of two within the Highland Council&#x27;s Caithness ward management area and one of seven within the council&#x27;s Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross corporate management area.

Thurso Community Council was created in 1975 when the burgh was abolished. The community council is not a tier of local government, but it is recognised as a level of statutory representation. The community council represents an area which is somewhat smaller than that represented by ward councillors. The ward area also includes parts of other community council areas.

==Geography==
Thurso is the most northerly town on the British mainland, situated on the northern coastline overlooking the Orkney Islands. It is situated at the northern terminus of the A9 road, the main road linking Caithness with the south of Scotland, and is west of John o&#x27; Groats and northwest of Wick, the closest town. Thurso railway station is the most northerly location served by Britain&#x27;s rail network, which links the town directly with Wick, the county town of Caithness, and with Inverness. Thurso is bordered by the parishes of Olrig and Bower to the east, Halkirk to the south, and Reay to the west, and stretches from Holborn Head and Crosskirk Bay in the west to Dunnet Head and Dunnet Bay in the east. It lies slightly further north than the Alaskan capital of Juneau, and slightly further south than the Swedish capital of Stockholm.

The River Thurso, reputable for its salmon fishing, flows through the town and into Thurso Bay and the Pentland Firth. The river estuary serves as a small harbour. Thurso has a fine harbour and beach and looks out over the Pentland Firth to the Orkney island of Hoy and the towering Old Man of Hoy (a stack of rock standing out from the main island).

===Climate===
Thurso has a cool oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), featuring similar weather to the Scottish Highlands. The highest temperature recorded was 
(July 1995) and the lowest (December 2010). Although Thurso is mild enough to permit the growth of trees, the windswept surroundings mostly consist of grasslands resembling the offshore northern archipelagoes of Orkney and Shetland. The sea remains chilly also in summer and offshore sea surface temperatures do not fluctuate much throughout the year.

==Economy==

Historically, Thurso was known for its production of linen cloth and had a thriving tanning business. Fishing has always been of major significance in the running of the local economy, and the Thurso Shipowner&#x27;s Association oversaw much of the shipping activity. The port of Scrabster lies about to the west of the estuary of the River Thurso, and plays a significant role in the white fish industry in Scotland. Scrabster has deep water in the shelter of Holborn Head. The harbour includes a berth for the &quot;MV Hamnavoe&quot;, a roll-on/roll-off ferry operated by Northlink linking the Scottish mainland with Stromness on Orkney. There is also a large fishmart and the local lifeboat is stationed there too. From June 2007, a summer-only weekly ferry service operated by the Faroese company Smyril Line reopened, connecting Scrabster with the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway, but has now been discontinued.
Thurso has a small museum, North Coast Visitor Centre, several hotels and bars, a surf shop/cafe stocking famous brands, and a small skatepark. There is also a sizeable British Telecom call centre and a plant making lithium-ion batteries for the MoD on the west side of the town, which along with the Dounreay Nuclear power plant, provide a high level of employment in Caithness. On 12 January 2010, approval was granted for the Baillie wind farm near Thurso which will feature 21 turbines and supply 52.5 MW, enough for 25,000 homes.

==Landmarks==
The Category A listed ruined Old St Peter&#x27;s Church (St. Peter&#x27;s Kirk) is one of the older churches in Scotland, dated to at least 1125, and at one time it was the principal church for the county, administered by the Bishops of Caithness. The church held hearings against criminal activity and determined how those caught should be punished. In 1701, a woman who had a relationship with a Dutch sailor had her head shaved and was publicly shamed, paraded through the town by the local hangman.

The current church, St Andrew&#x27;s and St Peter&#x27;s, was built in 1832 to a design by William Burn in the Gothic style with buttressed walls and a square tower. The pipe organ was added by Norman &amp; Beard in 1914, and in 1922 Oscar Paterson contributed some of the stained glass windows such as &#x27;The Sower&#x27;. In 2013 gravestones were vandalised in the graveyard. Holburn Head Lighthouse, within the parish territory, was completed in 1862 to a design by David &amp; Thomas Stevenson and has since achieved Category B listed status.

The Swanson Gallery of Thurso hosts exhibitions throughout the year, and showcases glass art by Ian Pearson. The North Coast Visitor Centre also hosts exhibitions. Hotels of note include the 103-room Royal Hotel, Pentland Hotel, Waterside House, Murray House and the Category B listed Forss House Hotel, about 4 miles to the west of Thurso in a Georgian country mansion. At Sir John&#x27;s Square is an ornamental garden and statue which was donated to the town by Sir Tollemache Sinclair in memory of his grandfather Sir John Sinclair, a prominent local figure responsible for the &quot;compilation of the First Statistical Account of Scotland and the pioneering of agricultural reforms in Caithness&quot;. A Category C listed fountain was built in 1894 by the son of Sir George Sinclair. Also of note is the wellhouse of Meadow Well at the junction of Traill Street and Manson&#x27;s Lane, which was the primary water supply for Thurso for centuries. The current well, with a conical roof, was completed in 1823.

The war memorial in Thurso dates from 1922 and was designed by Percy Portsmouth.

==Education==

The main campus of North Highland College, formerly Thurso College, is one of several partner colleges which constitute the University of the Highlands &amp; Islands. It offers several certificate, diploma and degree courses from subjects as diverse as Nuclear Decommissioning, Hairdressing, Gamekeeping and Golf Management. Adjacent to the UHI is Thurso High School, the most northerly secondary school on the British mainland, established in 1958. The town also has three primary schools, Pennyland, Miller Academy Primary and Mount Pleasant. Mount Pleasant Primary School has a Scottish Gaelic medium unit, part of a revival of the language in Caithness. According to the 2011 census, 110 residents of the town age three and over (1.43%) speak Gaelic while 181 overall (2.35%) have some facility with the language. A Gaelic language nursery school, Cròileagan Inbhir Theòrsa, was created in the town in 1996.

North Coast Visitor Centre is a small museum that opened in 2021, following the closure of Caithness Horizons in 2019. The museum continues to host panels from the control room at the Dounreay Materials Testing Reactor (DMTR), which in 1958 had become Scotland&#x27;s first operation nuclear reactor.

==Sport==

With its powerful swells, Thurso is a notable location for surfing and kayaking, with international surfing championship events having regularly been held in the area. It attracts surfers from all over the world, and both the European Surfing Championships and Scottish Surf Kayaking Championships have been held in Caithness, with Thurso East being the main focus of activity. An annual raft race is organised by the North Coast Branch of Coastguard Association.

The football team, Thurso FC (nicknamed &quot;the Vikings&quot;), was established in 1998 and plays in the North Caledonian League. Caithness Crushers are a rugby league club playing in the Scotland Rugby League Conference Division 1, while Caithness RFC are a rugby union club that participate in the Caledonia One. The local athletics club is Caithness Amateur Athletics Club (C.A.A.C.); hurdler Moira Mcbeath was a 1986 Commonwealth Games athlete. Thurso has the largest swimming club in the Highland area, Thurso Amateur Swimming Club (TASC), with over 250 members. Thurso Bowling Club is next door to the Tesco supermarket. Also of note is Caithness Motocross Club, which stages races fortnightly during the summer on tracks around the county.

==Transport==

Thurso railway station opened in 1874. It was the most northern station on the Sutherland and Caithness Railway. The station became part of the Highland Railway Company in the late 19th century before being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. and it is now part of the Far North Line.

The nearby port of Scrabster provides ferry services to the Orkney Islands. The A9 trunk road, which connects Thurso to Inverness, Perth, the M90 motorway and the Central Belt ends at the ferry terminal. Stagecoach run bus services from Thurso to Wick and John o&#x27; Groats, and a long-distance service to Helmsdale and Inverness.

<text>Ullapool (; ) is a village and port located in the civil parish of Lochbroom in the county of Ross and Cromarty, Scottish Highlands. It is located around northwest of Inverness. According to the Scottish Government in 2016, the village had a population of 1,520 people, making it the largest settlement in Wester Ross. 

Ullapool sits on a deep sea loch, Loch Broom, a significant natural harbour. As a result, Ullapool&#x27;s port is regionally significant with ferries operated by Caledonian MacBrayne running from Ullapool to Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis. It also serves leisure craft, commercial fishing vessels and cruise ships.

The A835 road from Inverness to Durness passes through the village. This forms part of the route of the scenic tourist route the North Coast 500.

==History==
On the east shore of Loch Broom, Ullapool was founded in 1788 as a herring port by the British Fisheries Society. It was designed by Thomas Telford. Prior to 1788 the town was only an insignificant hamlet made up of just over 20 households. The harbour is used as a fishing port, yachting haven, and ferry port. 

A road to link Ullapool with Dingwall was commenced in 1792. The village was historically in Cromartyshire, a county made up of many separate enclaves scattered across northern Ross-shire. Cromartyshire was abolished and combined with surrounding Ross-shire in 1890.

Many of the pivotal Victorian era discoveries that informed the concept of plate tectonics were made in this area. There are still regular international geological conferences held in Ullapool, which has been described as the top geological hotspot in Scotland.

Parliament granted permission in the 1890s for a railway from Ullapool to the main Highland network at Garve railway station, but the scheme was abandoned due to insufficient funds.

The name is possibly derived from the Norse word for &quot;wool farm&quot; or &quot;Ulli&#x27;s farm&quot;.

==Landscape and geology==
The region surrounding Ullapool is dominated by rugged mountains, and especially by Bheinn Ghobhlach to the west, An Teallach to the southwest (both across the loch), Beinn Dearg to the southeast close to the head of Loch Broom, and Beinn Mhòr na Còigich to the north. These summits are referred to as periglacial enclaves, a term used to describe areas that were adjacent to glaciers and impacted by cold climates.

An Teallach is a mountain which dominates the area and consists of Torridonian sandstone, which is layered nearly horizontally. It is a challenging climb and a considerable distance from the nearest road. Climbing affords views to the sea and the islands to the west, but also to the south, and the desolate Whitbread wilderness.

Ullapool sits on a substantial geological structure known as the Moine Thrust Belt. This geological feature spans a considerable distance from Loch Eriboll in the north, extending southwards to the Isle of Skye. The Moine Thrust Belt represents the western margin of the Caledonian orogeny which took place during the Palaeozoic era.

==Culture==

Venues for music and the performing arts in Ullapool include the &quot;Macphail Centre&quot;, which is located in the High School and includes a small theatre, and &quot;The Ceilidh Place&quot;, a hotel, restaurant, and music venue which has previously held concerts by artists including Rab Noakes, Dick Gaughan, Kathleen MacInnes, and The Peatbog Faeries. The Ullapool Guitar Festival is also held annually in the village.

, an arts centre, is located in the village, along with a swimming pool and fitness centre, and several pubs, restaurants, and tourist accommodation facilities. The 19th, and final, Ullapool Book Festival was held in the village in May 2023. The Tall Ships visited Ullapool in July 2011, whilst sailing from Greenock to Lerwick.

Ullapool was home to the shinty team Lochbroom Camanachd; however, the club has not completed a competitive fixture since 2015.

==Music==
Throughout the year there are many small fèisean and music festivals in the local halls and hotels, especially in the Ceilidh Place and the Arch Inn. The Ullapool Guitar Festival takes place in early October each year, attracting performers at several venues over the weekend.

The Loopallu Festival, created by the American rock-grass band Hayseed Dixie and local promoter Robert Hicks in 2005, was well received and has become a major regional annual event, more than doubling the size of the village during the festival. In 2007 it attracted several bands including The Saw Doctors, Dreadzone and Franz Ferdinand headlining on the second night. There are also fringe events at local bars. The Pigeon Detectives have played the Village Hall. Amy MacDonald in 2008 and Paolo Nutini in 2007 both played the Ceilidh Place. Mumford &amp; Sons have also played in Ullapool twice. The final festival took place in 2019.

Since 2023, the village has hosted Scotland&#x27;s &quot;most remote club night&quot;, called &quot;baile/baile&quot;, which showcases local and national DJs.

Ullapool has a local radio station called Lochbroom FM broadcasting on 102.2 and 96.8 FM and online, with programming provided mostly by Two Lochs Radio in Gairloch.

==In popular culture==
The community was rated as among the &quot;20 most beautiful villages in the UK and Ireland&quot; by Condé Nast Traveler in 2020.

Ullapool is referenced in the multiplayer video game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; as the hometown of Tavish DeGroot, known in-game as the Demoman, and in the name of an in-game melee weapon that the Demoman can choose to have in his loadout, the &quot;Ullapool Caber&quot;, a german type 24 stick hand grenade.

==Ferry service==
In 1970, Ross and Cromarty council voted to create a new £460,000 () ferry terminal at Ullapool, from Stornoway, replacing that at the Kyle of Lochalsh that is from Stornoway. The ferry terminal is linked to the A835 trunk road with the A893. During 2022 the Ullapool Harbour Trust commenced a £4.3 million project to construct a new promenade and wider access road along the trunk road which will improve the inner harbour, provide pontoons for marine tourism and provide better access for pedestrians and cyclists. At the terminal Caledonian MacBrayne operates a roll-on/roll-off carferry to Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis.

==Climate==
Ullapool has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with, considering its northerly latitude, relatively mild temperatures year-round. With an average 1,105 sunshine hours per year, it is cloudier than any major city in Europe.

<doc id="352440" wikidata="Q224418" url="?curid=352440" title="Samovar">
<text>A samovar (, , ) is a metal container traditionally used to heat and boil water. Although originating in Russia, the samovar is well known outside of Russia and has spread through Russian culture to other parts of Eastern Europe, as well as Western and Central and South Asia. Since the heated water is typically used to make tea, many samovars have a ring-shaped attachment (, ) around the chimney to hold and heat a teapot filled with tea concentrate. Though traditionally heated with coal or , many newer samovars use electricity to heat water in a manner similar to an electric water boiler. 
==Description==
A Samovar typically is made of iron, copper, polished brass, bronze, silver, gold, tin, or nickel — and consists of a body, base and chimney, cover and steam vent, handles, tap and key, crown and ring, chimney extension and cap, drip-bowl, and teapot. The body shape can be an urn, krater, barrel, cylinder, or sphere. Sizes and designs vary, from very large capacity to smaller family-sized vessels, holding , and those of a modest size.

A traditional samovar consists of a large metal container with a tap near the bottom and a metal pipe running vertically through the middle. The pipe is filled with solid fuel which is ignited to heat the water in the surrounding container. A small (6 to 8 inch/15 to 20 cm) smoke-stack is put on the top to ensure draft. After the water boils and the fire is extinguished, the smoke-stack can be removed and a teapot placed on top to be heated by the rising hot air. The teapot is used to brew a strong concentrate of tea known as &quot;zavarka&quot; (&quot;заварка&quot;). The tea is served by diluting this concentrate with boiled water from the main container, usually at a water-to-tea ratio of 10-to-1, varying to taste.

==History==
The origin and history of the samovar prior to the 18th century is unknown.
Connections exist to a similar Greek water-heater of classical antiquity, the autepsa, a vase with a central tube for coal. 
The Russian tradition was probably influenced by Byzantine and Central Asian cultures. Conversely, Russian culture also influenced Asian, Western European and Byzantine cultures. 
&quot;Samovar-like&quot; pottery found in Shaki, Azerbaijan in 1989 was estimated to be at least 3,600 years old. While it differed from modern samovars in many respects, it contained the distinguishing functional feature of an inner cylindrical tube that increased the area available for heating the water. Unlike modern samovars, the tube was not closed from below, and so the device relied on an external fire (i.e. by placing it above the flame) instead of carrying its fuel and fire internally.

The first historically recorded samovar-makers were the Russian Lisitsyn brothers, Ivan Fyodorovich and Nazar Fyodorovich. From their childhood they were engaged in metalworking at the brass factory of their father, Fyodor Ivanovich Lisitsyn. In 1778 they made a samovar, and the same year Nazar Lisitsyn registered the first samovar-making factory in Russia. They may not have been the inventors of the samovar, but they were the first documented samovar-makers, and their various and beautiful samovar designs became very influential throughout the later history of samovar-making. 
These and other early producers lived in Tula, a city known for its metalworkers and arms-makers. Since the 18th century Tula has been also the main center of Russian samovar production, with &quot;tul&#x27;sky samovar&quot; being the brand mark of the city. A Russian saying equivalent to &quot;carrying coal to Newcastle&quot; is &quot;to travel to Tula with one&#x27;s own samovar&quot;. Although Central Russia and the Ural region were among the first Samovar producers, over time several samovar producers emerged all over Russia, which gave the samovar its different local characteristics. By the 19th century samovars were already a common feature of Russian tea culture. They were produced in large numbers and exported to Central Asia and other regions.

The samovar was an important attribute of Russian households and taverns to tea-drinking. It was used by all classes, from the poorest peasants up to the most well-suited people. The Russian expression &quot;to have a sit by the samovar&quot; means to have a leisurely talk while drinking tea from a samovar. In everyday use samovars were an economical permanent source of hot water in older times. Various slow-burning items could be used for fuel, such as charcoal or dry pinecones. When not in use, the fire in the samovar pipe faintly smouldered. As needed it could be quickly rekindled with the help of bellows. Although a Russian jackboot &quot;сапог&quot; (&quot;sapog&quot;) could be used for this purpose, bellows were manufactured specifically for use on samovars. Today samovars are popular souvenirs among tourists in Russia.

== Outside Russia ==
The Russian word was adopted as &quot;samovar&quot;, and .

===Iran===

Samovar culture has an analog in Iran and is maintained by expatriates around the world. In Iran, samovars have been used for at least two centuries (roughly since the era of close political and ethnic contact between Russia and Iran started), and electrical, oil-burning or natural gas-consuming samovars are still common. Samovar is &quot;samăvar&quot; in Persian. Iranian craftsmen used Persian art motifs in their samovar production. The Iranian city of Borujerd has been the main centre of samovar production and a few workshops still produce hand-made samovars. Borujerd&#x27;s samovars are often made with German silver, in keeping with the famous Varsho-Sazi artistic style. The art samovars of Borujerd are often displayed in Iranian and Western museums as illustrations of Iranian art and handicraft.

===Kashmir===

Kashmiri samovars are made of copper with engraved or embossed calligraphic motifs. In fact in Kashmir, there were two variants of samovar. The copper samovar was used by Muslims and that of brass was used by local Hindus called Kashmiri Pandit. The brass samovars were nickel-plated inside. Inside a samovar there is a fire-container in which charcoal and live coals are placed. Around the fire-container there is a space for water to boil. Green tea leaves, salt, cardamom, and cinnamon are put into the water.

===Turkey===

Turkish samovars are popular souvenirs among tourists, and charcoal burning samovars are still popular in the fields. However, in the modern homes they have been replaced with the çaydanlık (lit. &quot;teapot&quot;), a metal teapot with a smaller teapot on top taking the place of the cap of the lower one. To make Turkish tea, the lower part is used to boil the water and the upper part, called &quot;demlik&quot; is used for concentrated tea. Tea is poured first from the &quot;demlik&quot; and then diluted to the desired level with plain boiling water from the lower tea kettle. The body is traditionally made of brass or copper, occasionally also silver or gold, but &quot;çaydanlık&quot; are now also made from stainless steel, aluminium, or ceramics with plastic, steel or aluminium handles.

<text>Dornoch (; ; ) is a town, seaside resort, parish and former royal burgh in the county of Sutherland in the Highlands of Scotland. It lies on the north shore of the Dornoch Firth, near to where it opens into the Moray Firth to the east.

The town is within the Highland local government council area. The town is near the A9 road, to which it is linked by the A949 and the B9168. The town also has a grass air strip suitable for small aircraft and helicopters.

==History==
The name &#x27;Dornoch&#x27; is derived from the Gaelic for &#x27;pebbly place&#x27;, suggesting that the area contained pebbles the size of a fist (&quot;dorn&quot;) which could therefore be used as weapons. Archaeological excavations during the development of a new business park in 1997 revealed a building, evidence for ironworking and part of a whale, dating from the 8th to the 11th centuries AD. The archaeologists surmised that the findings were of an industrial area on the edge of a settlement and that a settlement existed at Dornoch from at least the 8th century. However, the first direct reference to a settlement in Dornoch is not until the early 12th century when David I, as recorded in the Dunfermline Abbey register, orders Rognvald, the Earl of Orkney, to respect the monks at Dornoch.

Dornoch has the thirteenth-century Dornoch Cathedral, the Old Town Jail, Dornoch Sheriff Court and Dornoch Castle, which is now a hotel. There is also a notable golf course, the Royal Dornoch Golf Club, named No. 2 on the 2024/24 &quot;Golf Digest&quot; list of Top 100 International (outside U.S.) courses.

It is also notable as the last place a witch was burnt in Scotland. Her name was reported as Janet Horne; she was tried and condemned to death in 1727. There is a stone, the Witch&#x27;s Stone, commemorating her death, inscribed with the year 1722. The golf course designer Donald Ross began his career as a greenkeeper on the Royal Dornoch links. The golf course is next to the award-winning blue flag beach.

Dornoch used to be connected to the main railway network at The Mound by a light railway. The railway was opened on 2 June 1902. Stations on the line were Dornoch, Embo, Skelbo, Cambusavie Halt and The Mound Junction. The stations were shut on 13 June 1960.

Dornoch Academy Modern Languages teacher Margaret C. Davidson led the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies in the burgh from 1913, volunteered as a nurse in the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals in France in World War One and returned to teach and serve as a Girl Guide leader in 1931.

On 21 December 2000, the pop star Madonna had her son Rocco christened in Dornoch Cathedral, the day before her wedding to Guy Ritchie in nearby Skibo Castle.

On 13 January 2005, Dornoch was granted Fairtrade Town status.

The Burghfield House Campus of the University of the Highlands and Islands in Dornoch is the home for the Centre for History, teaching undergraduate and postgraduate history degrees to students around the UHI network and worldwide.

==Governance==
Dornoch was a parliamentary burgh, combined with Dingwall, Kirkwall, Tain and Wick in the Northern Burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. Cromarty was added to the list in 1832.

The constituency was a district of burghs known also as Tain Burghs until 1832, and then as Wick Burghs. It was represented by one Member of Parliament (MP). In 1918 the constituency was abolished and the Dornoch component was merged into the then new county constituency of Caithness and Sutherland.

Scotland&#x27;s Westminster constituencies were redrawn for the 2005 UK general election, when Dornoch became part of the new Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency. Since 2017, the MP has been Jamie Stone of the Liberal Democrats.

In the Scottish Parliament, since 2011 Dornoch has been part of the Caithness, Sutherland and Ross constituency. It elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post method of election. Since its creation, the constituency has been held by the Scottish National Party (SNP). the MSP is Maree Todd, who was first elected in May 2021.

It is also one of eight constituencies in the Highlands and Islands Scottish Parliament region, which elects seven additional members, in addition to eight constituency MSPs, to produce a form of proportional representation for the region as a whole.

There is also elected local government councillors, and as of November 2011 there are elected community councillors.

==Dornoch in popular culture==
Rosamunde Pilcher&#x27;s last novel &quot;Winter Solstice&quot; is largely set in and around Dornoch, fictionalised under the name of Creagan.

<doc id="352450" wikidata="Q2928458" url="?curid=352450" title="Royal burgh">
<text>A royal burgh ( ) was a type of Scottish burgh which had been founded by, or subsequently granted, a royal charter. Although abolished by law in 1975, the term is still used by many former royal burghs.

Most royal burghs were either created by the Crown, or upgraded from another status, such as burgh of barony. As discrete classes of burgh emerged, the royal burghs—originally distinctive because they were on royal lands—acquired a monopoly of foreign trade.

An important document for each burgh was its burgh charter, creating the burgh or confirming the rights of the burgh as laid down (perhaps orally) by a previous monarch. Each royal burgh (with the exception of four &#x27;inactive burghs&#x27;) was represented in the Parliament of Scotland and could appoint bailies with wide powers in civil and criminal justice. By 1707 there were 70 royal burghs.
The  (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 76) reformed the election of the town councils that governed royal burghs. Those qualified to vote in parliamentary elections under the Reform Act 1832 were now entitled to elect burgh councillors.

==Origins==
Before the reign of David I Scotland had no towns. The closest thing to towns were the larger than average population concentrations around large monasteries, such as Dunkeld and St Andrews, and regionally significant fortifications. Scotland, outside Lothian at least, was populated by scattered hamlets, and outside that area, lacked the continental style nucleated village. David I established the first burghs in Scotland, initially only in Middle-English-speaking Lothian (note:Tain claims a charter dating from 1066 under Malcolm III). The earliest burghs, founded by 1124, were Berwick and Roxburgh. However, by 1130, David had established burghs in Gaelic areas: Stirling, Dunfermline, Perth and Scone, as well as Edinburgh. The conquest of Moray in that same year led to the establishment of burghs at Elgin and Forres. Before David was dead, St Andrews, Montrose, and Aberdeen were also burghs. In the reigns of Máel Coluim IV and William, burghs were added at Inverness, Banff, Cullen, Auldearn, Nairn, Inverurie, Kintore, Brechin, Forfar, Arbroath, Dundee, Lanark, Dumfries and (uniquely for the west coast) Ayr. New Lothian burghs also came into existence, at Haddington and Peebles. By 1210, there were 40 burghs in the Scottish kingdom. Rosemarkie, Dingwall and Cromarty were also burghs by the Scottish Wars of Independence.

The date of the initial establishment of burghs in Scotland is obscure. Historian Ian D. Whyte points to the &quot;Leges Burgorum&quot; (&quot;Laws of the Burghs&quot;) as the best known compilation of medieval burgh laws, saying that most of the laws therein “were modelled on the mid-twelfth century customs of Newcastle upon Tyne” at a time when Newcastle was under Scottish rule. A mid-twelfth century date corresponds to the reigns of two Scottish kings: David I (1124-1153) and William I (1165-1214). In 1609, the publisher of the &quot;Laws of the Burghs&quot; stated that burgh laws were begun by David I, but this was called into question in 1807 by George Chalmers, who pointed out that David I never held Newcastle. At any rate, Whyte notes that medieval Scottish burghs, when compared to their English counterparts, were more uniform and, by the fourteenth century, more politically active.

Because of Scottish trading patterns, Scottish burghs came to be populated by foreigners, notably Flemings, French, and English.

The burgh&#x27;s vocabulary was composed totally of either Germanic terms (not necessarily or even predominantly English) such as &quot;croft&quot;, &quot;rood&quot;, &quot;gild&quot;, &quot;gait&quot; and &quot;wynd&quot;, or French ones such as &quot;provost&quot;, &quot;bailie&quot;, &quot;vennel&quot;, &quot;port&quot; and &quot;ferme&quot;. The councils that governed individual burghs were individually known as &quot;lie doussane&quot;, meaning the dozen.

* Kilrenny, Anstruther Easter and Anstruther Wester (formed by union of three royal burghs 1930)

==Abolition and status since 1975==
The rights of the royal burghs were preserved (if not guaranteed) by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union between Scotland and England of 1707, which states &quot;That the Rights and Privileges of the Royal Boroughs in Scotland as they now are Do Remain entire after the Union and notwithstanding thereof&quot;.

Royal burghs were abolished in 1975 by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, and the above-mentioned Article XXI, which was thus rendered redundant, was deemed by Her Majesty&#x27;s Government to be abrogated by the 1973 act. The towns are now sometimes referred to officially as &quot;former royal burghs&quot;, for instance by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland.

The issue of the future status of royal burghs was discussed during debate on the Local Government Bill. In the Commons on 4 December 1972 Ronald Murray, the member of parliament (MP) for Edinburgh, Leith, stated &quot;Most of the well-known cities and towns of Scotland became royal burghs by Charter. The Bill does not say that those Charters are removed or are of no legal effect, but Schedule 24 repeals the legislation upon which they appear to stand. I hope that the Government do not intend to abolish entirely the ancient rights of royal burghs, at least to be royal burghs.&quot;

In June 1973, David Steel (MP for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles), unsuccessfully introduced an amendment that &quot;the title of &quot;Provost&quot; shall attach to the chairman of any community council which is based on any existing burgh .. to .. carry forward a title which appears, for example, in the Royal Charters of those burghs&quot;.

In 1977, Alick Buchanan-Smith (MP for North Angus and Mearns) asked Frank McElhone, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland: &quot;Why a community council for a former Royal burgh is not able to use the words &quot;Royal Burgh&quot; in its title; and what scope there is for the continuance of historical titles under the present organisation of local authorities.&quot;

In reply, McElhone stated: &quot;The title which may be used by a community council is a matter for the district council to decide when drawing up the scheme for community councils in its area. Section 23 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 governs any change of name of region, islands or district councils. There is no statutory ban to the continuance of historic titles for other purposes.&quot;

Accordingly, some community councils established since 1975 have the term &quot;Royal Burgh&quot; incorporated in their title. Lord Lyon has permitted the armorial bearings of a number of royal burghs to be rematriculated by community councils.

<text>The Peak Cavern, also known as the Devil&#x27;s Arse, is one of the four show caves in Castleton, Derbyshire, England. Peakshole Water flows through and out of the cave, which has the largest cave entrance in Britain.

== Overview ==

Unlike the other show caves in the area, Peak Cavern is almost entirely natural; the only artificial part of the cave was blasted to bypass a low tunnel that was only accessible by lying down on a boat. The cave system is the largest in the Peak District, and the main entrance is the largest cave entrance in Britain. Until 1915, the cave was home to some of Britain&#x27;s last s, who lived in houses built inside the cave mouth and made a living from rope making, while the depths of the cave were known as a haven for bandits. In legend, it was where thieves&#x27; cant was created by a meeting between Cock Lorel, leader of the rogues, and Giles Hather, the King of the Gypsies.

Several passages lead from the entrance, known as &quot;The Vestibule&quot;. The only one open to the public is &quot;Lumbago Walk&quot;, named as traversing it requires most adults to stoop. The route continues through two main caverns, &quot;The Great Cave&quot; and &quot;Roger Rain&#x27;s House&quot;, and into a passage, &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Dining Room&quot; – This is now the furthest point currently open to the public, but before 1990 the show cave extended almost twice its current length; down &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Staircase&quot; to &quot;Halfway House&quot; along a raised bank path which crossed an underground stream known as &quot;Inner Styx&quot; via a series of four wooden bridges, under &quot;Five Arches&quot; to the junction of Buxton Water Sump. This section often floods in winter, and occasionally summer, which required regular clearing of debris and mending of the safety fences at the start of the tourist season in April (cave tours were not an all-year event until 1997). In the mid-1980s, there was a worldwide scare over the possible dangers of radon, a gas found to be present in this lower part of the cave and a potential issue for tour guides frequently exposed to it. This, along with the maintenance required, led to the Five Arches part of the tour being closed to the public in 1989, the same year that the BBC filmed &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; at this location. It can, however, still be accessed by cavers, and a ventilation system here expels cave air to surface at Cave Dale. There have since been efforts to return this area of cave to a more natural state by erasing the history of its show-cave past, removing the wooden bridges which had served generations of paying visitors.

From Five Arches, several routes are open to cavers. The main path, to the right, leads beneath &quot;Victoria Aven&quot;, a sizeable natural shaft approximately high, and on to &quot;Far Sump&quot;, through which lies the Far Sump Extension. This area was first explored in 1980, but difficult access limited discoveries until routes through from Speedwell Cavern and James Hall&#x27;s Over Engine Mine were opened in 1996. This permitted further exploration, and in 1999 Titan Shaft was discovered, at the deepest pitch in Britain.

==Name==
Historically the cave was known as the Devil&#x27;s Arse, under which name it is described in William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; of 1586:

The cavern was declared to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Peak by philosopher Thomas Hobbes in his 1636 book &quot;De Mirabilibus Pecci: Being The Wonders of the Peak in Darby-shire, Commonly called The Devil&#x27;s Arse of Peak.&quot;

Daniel Defoe uses the same name in his &quot;A tour thro&#x27; the whole island of Great Britain&quot; (1724–26):

and also mentions the shepherd story recorded by Gervase of Tilbury. 

The name of the cave was thought to have been changed to &quot;Peak Cavern&quot; in order not to cause offence to Queen Victoria during an 1842 visit, but the Queen herself later asserted that she had never visited the cavern. More recently the cave has been promoted using its older, more vulgar name. The name may have arisen because of the flatulent-sounding noises from inside the cave when flood water is draining away.

==Events==

The cavern has hosted concerts by Jarvis Cocker, Richard Hawley and The Vaccines. In 2013 the operators began promoting more concerts and events as a way to secure new streams of income. It was transformed into a cinema during Sheffield Doc/Fest in 2013 for a screening of &quot;The Summit&quot; attended by 500 people. The success of this event led to screenings every night during Doc/Fest 2014, including &quot;Happiness&quot; and &quot;Cave of Forgotten Dreams&quot;. 

In May 2022, John Shuttleworth had to abandon a performance in the Peak Cavern, Derbyshire, due to fears of rocks falling down the cliff face. An operation by the Edale Mountain Rescue ensued to reach a walker who had fallen down the side of the cavern and was clinging to a tree above a 100 ft (30 m) drop.

<text>A bucket is typically a watertight, vertical cylinder or truncated cone or square, with an open top and a flat bottom, attached to a semicircular carrying handle called the &quot;bail&quot;.

A bucket is usually an open-top container. In contrast, a pail can have a top or lid and is a shipping container. In non-technical usage, the two terms are often used interchangeably.

==Types and uses==
A number of bucket types exist, used for a variety of purposes. Though most of these are functional purposes, a number, including those constructed from precious metals, are used for ceremonial purposes. Common types of bucket and their adjoining purposes include:

* Water buckets used to carry water
* Household and garden buckets used for carrying liquids and granular products
* Elaborate ceremonial or ritual buckets constructed of bronze, ivory or other materials, found in several ancient or medieval cultures, sometimes known by the Latin for bucket, 
* Large scoops or buckets attached to loaders and telehandlers for landscaping agricultural and purposes
* Canvas buckets made of woven fabric, developed as a fire-resistant alternative to leather
* Crusher buckets attached to excavators used for crushing and recycling material in the construction industry
* Buckets shaped like castles often used as children&#x27;s toys to shape and carry sand on a beach or in a sandpit
* Buckets in special shapes such as cast iron buckets or smelting buckets to hold liquid metal at high temperatures

Though not always bucket shaped, lunch boxes are sometimes known as lunch pails or a lunch bucket. Buckets can be repurposed as seats, tool caddies, hydroponic gardens, chamber pots, &quot;street&quot; drums, or livestock feeders, amongst other uses. Buckets are also repurposed for the use of long term food storage by survivalists.

==Shipping containers==
When in reference to a shipping container, the term &quot;pail&quot; is used as a technical term, specifically referring to a bucket shaped package with a sealed top or lid, which is then used as a transport container for chemicals and industrial products.

==Gallery==
==English language phrases and idioms==
The bucket has been used in many phrases and idioms in the English language, some of which are regional or specific to the use of English in different English-speaking countries.

* Kick the bucket: an informal term referring to someone&#x27;s death
* Drop the bucket on: to implicate a person in something (from Australian slang)
* A drop in the bucket: a small, inadequate amount in relation to how much is requested or asked, taken from the biblical Book of Isaiah, chapter 40, verse 15
* Bucket list: a list of activities an individual wishes to undertake before death

==Unit of measurement==
As an obsolete unit of measurement, at least one source documents a &#x27;bucket&#x27; as being equivalent to .

<text>Dimitrie Paciurea (; 2 November (1873 or 1875) – 14 July 1932) was a Romanian sculptor. His representational and symbolic style contrasts strongly to the more abstract style of his contemporary and co-national Constantin Brâncuși.

Born in Bucharest, he attended the Matei Basarab High School. He then studied at the National School of Fine Arts in Bucharest (1890–1894), and later in Paris (1896–1900). 

In 1909 he was named professor at the National School of Fine Arts. 
Paciurea was one of the founders of the Romanian Art Society (1919). 
His students include Cornel Medrea, Ion Jalea, and Oscar Han. 
A room of the Romanian National Art Museum is devoted largely to his Chimera sculptures.

== Birthdate ==
Dimitrie&#x27;s birth year is uncertain:
* Oscar Han, &quot;Sculptorul Dimitrie Paciurea&quot;, Bucharest, 1935, p. 7, gives Paciurea&#x27;s birth year as 1875. 
* George Oprescu, &quot;Sculptura Româneasca&quot;, Bucharest, 1965, p. 93, lists 1875
* Ion Frunzetti, &quot;Paciurea&quot;, Bucharest, 1971, p. 12, date of birth as 2 November 1873. 
* Mircea Deac, &quot;Paciurea&quot;, Bucharest, 2000, p. 5, date of birth as 2 November 1873.

<text>City Slickers is a 1991 American Western comedy film directed by Ron Underwood and starring Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, Bruno Kirby and Jack Palance, with supporting roles by Patricia Wettig, Helen Slater and Noble Willingham, and Jake Gyllenhaal making his acting debut.

The film&#x27;s screenplay was written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, and it was shot in New York City; New Mexico; Durango, Colorado; and Spain. For his performance, Palance won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

A sequel titled &quot;The Legend of Curly&#x27;s Gold&quot; was released in 1994 with the same cast, with the exception of Kirby, who was replaced by Jon Lovitz in a different role.

== Plot ==

In Pamplona, Spain, middle-aged friends Mitch Robbins, Ed Furrilo, and Phil Berquist participate in the running of the bulls. As they fly back in the airplane, Mitch tells Ed he is getting fed up with their road trips. A year later, back home in New York City, Mitch realizes he and his friends use adventure trips as escapism from their boring lives, since he despises his radio advertising sales job, Phil is trapped in a loveless marriage to his shrewish wife Arlene while managing his father-in-law&#x27;s supermarket (who also bullies and humiliates Phil), and Ed is a successful and dashing sporting goods salesman who recently married a significantly younger woman but is unwilling to fully settle down.

At Mitch&#x27;s 39th birthday party, Phil and Ed give Mitch a trip for all three to go on a two-week cattle drive from New Mexico to Colorado. Phil&#x27;s 20-year-old employee Nancy unexpectedly arrives at the party and announces she is pregnant with his baby, causing Arlene to walk out after a fight. Mitch&#x27;s wife, Barbara, insists he go on the cattle drive to soul search for a new purpose in his life.

In New Mexico, the trio meet ranch owner Clay Stone and their fellow cattle drivers: entrepreneurial brothers Barry and Ira Shalowitz, young and attractive Bonnie, and father-son dentists Ben and Steve Jessup, ranch hands Jeff and T.R., and Cookie the cook. Mitch confronts Jeff and T.R. when they begin sexually harassing Bonnie. Trail boss Curly intervenes, though he inadvertently humiliates Mitch.

During the drive, Mitch accidentally causes a stampede which destroys the camp. While searching for stray cows, Mitch discovers Curly has a kind and wise nature beneath his gruff exterior. Curly encourages Mitch to discover the &quot;one thing&quot; in his life that is most important to him. Along the way, Mitch helps deliver a calf from a dying cow. Mitch names the calf Norman. Shortly after, Curly suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving the drive under Jeff and T.R.&#x27;s control. Cookie accidentally gets drunk and inadvertently destroys the food supply, breaking his leg in the process.

After the Jessups leave to take Cookie to a nearby town (being more qualified because of their medical training in dentistry), Jeff and T.R. become intoxicated with Cookie&#x27;s secret stash. A fight ensues when they threaten to kill Norman and assault Mitch. Phil and Ed intervene, and Phil holds Jeff at gunpoint, which unleashes his pent-up emotions. Soon after, Jeff and T.R. abandon the group. Bonnie and the Shalowitzes continue on to the Colorado ranch, while Ed and Phil remain behind to finish the drive. Mitch also leaves but soon returns to rejoin his friends.

After braving a heavy storm, they drive the herd to Colorado. When Norman nearly drowns as the herd crosses a river, Mitch acts to save him. Both are swept down current, but Phil and Ed rescue them. They safely reach the Colorado ranch. When Stone offers to reimburse everyone&#x27;s fee, the Jessups prefer going on a future cattle drive. However, Clay reveals he is selling the herd to a meat-packing company. Mitch, Phil, and Ed initially believe they saved the cattle for nothing, but decide to use their experience to help re-evaluate their lives.

The men return to New York City. Mitch, a happier man, reunites with Barbara and their two children; he has also brought Norman home as a pet. Phil, having learned his employee is not pregnant after all, begins a relationship with Bonnie. Ed intends to start a family with his wife. Mitch is ready to restart his life with a new vision.

==Cast==
* Billy Crystal as Mitch Robbins, a radio station sales executive.
* Daniel Stern as Phil Berquist, a supermarket manager.
* Bruno Kirby as Ed Furillo, a sporting goods salesman.
* Patricia Wettig as Barbara Robbins, Mitch&#x27;s wife.
* Helen Slater as Bonnie Rayburn, a fellow cattle driver.
* Jack Palance as Curly Washburn, the leader of the cattle drive.

The cast also includes Jayne Meadows and Alan Charof as Mitch&#x27;s parents, and Lindsay Crystal and Jake Gyllenhaal as his children Holly and Danny Robbins. Jeffrey Tambor appears as Mitch&#x27;s supervisor Lou; Walker Brandt plays Ed&#x27;s newlywed wife Kim Furillo; Karla Tamburrelli appears as Phil&#x27;s wife Arlene Berquist, and Noble Willingham and Molly McClure plays dude ranch owner Clay Stone and his wife Millie. Yeardley Smith has a cameo role as Phil&#x27;s employee Nancy. 

Curly&#x27;s fellow cattle drivers include Bill Henderson and Phill Lewis as father-and-son dentists Ben and Steve Jessup, and Josh Mostel and David Paymer as sibling entrepreneurs Barry and Ira Shalowitz.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s plot, which consists of inexperienced cowboys battling villains as they press on with their cattle drive after the death of their leader, was conceived to be similar to John Wayne&#x27;s &quot;The Cowboys&quot;, although that was a Western drama as opposed to a comedy.

In his 2013 memoir, &quot;Still Foolin&#x27; Em&quot;, Billy Crystal writes of how the casting of the film came about. &quot;Palance,&quot; he says, &quot;was the first choice from the beginning, but had a commitment to make another film.&quot; He wrote that he contacted Charles Bronson about the part, only to be rudely rebuffed because the character dies. Palance got out of his other obligation to join the cast. Rick Moranis, originally cast as Phil, had to leave the production due to his wife&#x27;s illness. Daniel Stern was a late replacement in the role. The film was also the debut of actor Jake Gyllenhaal.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;City Slickers&quot; received an 87% rating based on 45 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;With a supremely talented cast and just enough midlife drama to add weight to its wildly silly overtones, &quot;City Slickers&quot; uses universal themes to earn big laughs.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on reviews from 25 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half out of four, and wrote: &quot;&quot;City Slickers&quot; comes packaged as one kind of movie – a slapstick comedy about white-collar guys on a dude ranch – and it delivers on that level while surprising me by being much more ambitious, and successful, than I expected. This is the proverbial comedy with the heart of truth, the tear in the eye along with the belly laugh. It&#x27;s funny, and it adds up to something.&quot; Jeff Menell of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said the film &quot;provides plenty of laughs and several one-liners that will be repeatedly heard throughout the coming months.&quot;

===Awards and honors===

Jack Palance, for his role as Curly, won the 1992 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, which was the only Oscar nomination the film received. His acceptance speech for the award is best remembered for his demonstration of one-armed push-ups, which he claimed convinced studio insurance agents that he was healthy enough to work on the film. 
Billy Crystal was the Academy Awards host, and used the humorous incident for several jokes throughout the evening. Later that night, Palance placed the Oscar on Crystal&#x27;s shoulder and said, &quot;Billy Crystal ... who thought it would be you?&quot; Crystal added in his book, &quot;We had a glass of champagne together, and I could only imagine what Charles Bronson was thinking as he went to sleep that night.&quot; The next year&#x27;s Oscars opened with Palance appearing to drag in a giant Academy Award, with Crystal (again the host) riding on the opposite end.

The film is also recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #86
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** Mitch Robbins: &quot;Hi, Curly, kill anyone today?&quot;
:: Curly: &quot;Day ain&#x27;t over yet.&quot;
:: – Nominated
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

The film is ranked No. 73 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* The Billy Crystal episode of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; featured a parody entitled &quot;City Schtickers&quot;, with Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear in Kirby and Stern&#x27;s roles.
* Funny or Die produced a mash-up short that combined the film with the 2016 HBO series &quot;Westworld&quot; that featured Crystal and Stern.
* In &quot;American Dad!&quot; season 8, episode 1, &quot;Love, AD Style&quot;, Roger Smith implies that one of his disguises is Lowell Ganz when he states, &quot;I co-wrote City Slickers with Babaloo Mandel but I can&#x27;t do this&quot; in regard to poorly running his bar.

<text>The Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE), also known as Harwell Laboratory, was the main centre for atomic energy research and development in the United Kingdom from 1946 to the 1990s. It was created, owned and funded by the British Government. 

A number of early research reactors were built here starting with  GLEEP in 1947 to provide the underlying science and technology behind the design and building of Britain&#x27;s nuclear reactors such as the Windscale Piles and Calder Hall nuclear power station. To support this an extensive array of research and design laboratories were built to enable research into all aspects of nuclear reactor and fuel design, and the development of pilot plants for fuel reprocessing. The site became a major employer in the Oxford area. 

In the 1990s demand for government-led research had significantly decreased and the site was subsequently gradually diversified to allow private investment, and was known from 2006 as the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus.

==Founding==
In 1945 John Cockcroft was asked to set up a research laboratory to further the use of nuclear fission for both military purposes and generating energy. The criteria for selection involved finding somewhere remote with a good water supply, but within reach of good transport links and a university with a nuclear physics laboratory. This more or less limited the choice to the areas around Oxford or Cambridge. It had been decided that an RAF airfield would be chosen, the aircraft hangars being ideal to house the large atomic piles that would need to be built. Although Cambridge University had the better nuclear physics facility (the Cavendish Laboratory), the RAF did not want to abandon any of its eastern airfields because of its potential involvement in the Cold War, therefore Harwell was chosen when the RAF made the airfield available. RAF Harwell was sixteen miles south of Oxford near Didcot and Harwell (at this time in Berkshire), and on 1 January 1946 the Atomic Energy Research Establishment was formed, coming under the Ministry of Supply. The scientists mostly took over both accommodations and work buildings from the departing RAF.

The early laboratory had several specialist divisions: Chemistry (initially headed by Egon Bretscher, later by Robert Spence, General Physics (H.W.B. Skinner), Nuclear Physics (initially headed by Otto Frisch, later E. Bretscher), Reactor Physics (John Dunworth), Theoretical Physics (Klaus Fuchs, later Brian Flowers and Walter Marshall), Isotopes (Henry Seligmann), Engineering (Harold Tongue, later Robert Jackson), Chemical Engineering (A.S. White), and Metallurgy (Bruce Chalmers, later Monty Finniston, FRS). Finniston was later to become chairman of the British Steel Corporation. Directors after Cockcroft included Basil Schonland, Sir Arthur Vick and Walter Marshall.
The decision to site AERE at Harwell had huge implications for a rural area which had depended mainly on agriculture for employment before World War II. The site (which quickly became known colloquially amongst the local population as &#x27;The Atomic&#x27;) became one of the main employers in the post-war period. It also led to an influx of labour from outside the area, putting pressure on already scarce housing stocks. In response to the problem, hostels and temporary housing were established around the site. The hostels were named Icknield Way House (&#x27;B&#x27; mess, the RAF sergeants&#x27; mess), Portway House (&#x27;C&#x27; Mess, the RAF airmans&#x27; mess) and Ridgeway House (&#x27;A&#x27; Mess, the officers&#x27; mess) provided either single or double room accommodation for staff and were adopted from existing RAF structures on the site. The class distinction was maintained by the UKAEA. A-Mess housed visiting scientists, B-Mess scientific support staff and some post-graduate scientists, and C-Mess industrial support staff. The temporary housing stock consisted of several hundred &#x27;Prefabs&#x27;, single storey structures manufactured in parts for quick erection, which were designed originally to help alleviate chronic housing shortages in the immediate post-war period in Britain. Two estates of &#x27;Prefabs&#x27; were built to the north and south of the site perimeter, along with a road system and parade of shops. In later years, conventional housing was provided on estates built in Abingdon, Grove (near Wantage) and Newbury for employees. A modern hostel (Rush Common House) was built in Abingdon. The houses were later sold (mainly to their occupants) in the 1980s and the hostels were demolished or adapted for other uses. The &#x27;Prefab&#x27; estates lasted until the early 1990s when the residents were transferred to local authority housing. The RAF prewar NCO married quarter housing at Harwell together other UKAEA housing in Abingdon, Grove, Wantage and Newbury totaling 129 houses were sold in their entirety to the Welbeck Estate Group in 1995 and following extensive refurbishment were sold to local buyers.

The remote nature of the Harwell site required AERE workers to be transported by shuttle bus. By 1956, nine contractors to AERE operated a total of 47 mostly second-hand buses and coaches on 41 staff shuttle services, which operated 24 hours a day to shuttle workers as far as Oxford, Newbury, Reading and Swindon to the Harwell site. These buses were initially painted in utilitarian Ministry of Supply grey livery, however by the mid-1950s, the AERE fleet began adopting an azure blue and grey livery with &#x27;AERE&#x27; signwriting.

==Early reactors==

Such was the interest in nuclear power and the priority devoted to it in those days that the first reactor, GLEEP, was operating by 15 August 1947. GLEEP (Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile) was a low-power (3kilowatt) graphite-moderated air-cooled reactor. The first reactor in Western Europe, it operated until 1990.

A successor to GLEEP, called BEPO (British Experimental Pile 0) was constructed based on the experience with GLEEP, and commenced operation in 1948. At 6MW, BEPO was much more powerful than GLEEP. The engineers at Harwell eventually decided that this small reactor should be put to some use, so the air that flowed over it was directed through an underground trench, where there were some pipes filled with water that connected to a secondary group of water-filled pipes that were used by the nearby establishments to heat offices. This was the first use of nuclear district heating in the UK. BEPO was shut down in 1968.

LIDO was an enriched uranium thermal swimming pool reactor which operated from 1956 to 1972 and was mainly used for shielding and nuclear physics experiments. It was fully dismantled and returned to a green field site in 1995. In the same building as LIDO, DAPHNE (Dido And Pluto Handmaiden for Nuclear Experiments) was constructed to test equipment used in experiments on the two larger reactors.

A pair of larger 26MW reactors, DIDO and PLUTO, which used enriched uranium with a heavy water moderator came online in 1956 and 1957 respectively. These reactors were used primarily for testing the behaviour of different materials under intense neutron irradiation to help decide what materials to build reactor components out of. A sample could be irradiated for a few months to simulate the radiation dose that it would receive over the lifetime of a power reactor. Both reactors were also used for neutron scattering crystallography. They took over commercial isotope production from BEPO after that was shut down. DIDO and PLUTO themselves were shut down in 1990 and the fuel, moderator and some ancillary buildings removed. The GLEEP reactor and the hangar it was situated in were decommissioned 2005. The current plans are to decommission the BEPO, DIDO and PLUTO reactors by 2020.

==Zeta==
One of the most significant experiments to occur at AERE was the ZETA fusion power experiment. An early attempt to build a large-scale nuclear fusion reactor, the project was started in 1954, and the first successes were achieved in 1957. In 1968 the project was shut down, as it was believed that no further progress could be made with the kind of design that ZETA represented (see Timeline of nuclear fusion).

==Organisational history==
In 1954 AERE was incorporated into the newly formed United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Harwell and other laboratories were to assume responsibility for atomic energy research and development. It was part of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).

During the 1970s the slowdown of the British nuclear energy program resulted in a greatly reduced demand for the kind of work being done by the UKAEA. Pressures on government spending also reduced the funding available. Reluctant to merely disband a quality scientific research organisation, UKAEA was required to divert its research effort to the solving of scientific problems for industry by providing paid consultancy or services. For example, an Operations Research Group was set up at Harwell, and developed shipping fleet scheduling software that was used to provide a service to British and overseas shipping companies and oil reservoir simulation software to help in the development of the UK&#x27;s North Sea oil interests. UKAEA was ordered to operate on a Trading Fund basis, i.e. to account for itself financially as though it was a private corporation, while remaining fully government owned. After several years of transition, UKAEA was divided in the early 1990s. UKAEA retained ownership of all land and infrastructure and of all nuclear facilities, and of businesses directly related to nuclear power. The remainder was privatised as AEA Technology and floated on the London Stock Exchange. Harwell Laboratory contained elements of both organisations, though the land and infrastructure was owned by UKAEA.
The name Atomic Energy Research Establishment was dropped at the same time, and the site became known as the &quot;Harwell International Business Centre&quot;. The site incorporates the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory which is home to the Science and Technology Facilities Council (including the ISIS neutron source and Diamond Light Source). In 2006, the name Harwell Science and Innovation Campus was introduced and management of the campus was passed to a Public / Private 50:50 Joint Venture partnership to take forward the management and redevelopment of the campus which has been re-branded as Harwell Oxford. In February 2009, part of the campus, the remaining nuclear licensed site, passed to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and is being decommissioned by Research Sites Restoration Limited (RSRL, from 2015 part of Magnox Ltd), on their behalf.

<doc id="352461" wikidata="Q1384012" url="?curid=352461" title="North East Derbyshire">
<text>North East Derbyshire is a local government district in Derbyshire, England. The council is based in the large village of Wingerworth. The district also includes the towns of Dronfield and Clay Cross as well as numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

The neighbouring districts are Chesterfield (which it almost surrounds), Bolsover, Amber Valley, Derbyshire Dales, Sheffield and Rotherham.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Chesterfield Rural District (except parish of Brimington, which went to Chesterfield)
*Clay Cross Urban District
*Dronfield Urban District
The new district was named North East Derbyshire, reflecting its position within the wider county.

==Governance==


North East Derbyshire District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Derbyshire County Council. The district is also entirely covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

Since 2014 the district has been a non-constituent member of the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (formerly known as the Sheffield City Region); the council sends representatives to meetings of the combined authority, but the electorate of North East Derbyshire District does not vote in elections for the Mayor of South Yorkshire. The district is also part of The Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Local Enterprise Partnership.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2004 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 53 councillors, representing 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===

Since 2015 the council has been based at offices on Mill Lane in Wingerworth. Prior to 2015 the council was based at the former Chesterfield Rural District Council&#x27;s offices at the Council House on Saltergate in Chesterfield, outside the council&#x27;s own area. The Council House had been built in 1938 and was substantially extended shortly after North East Derbyshire&#x27;s creation in 1974.

==Parishes and settlements==

The district is entirely covered by civil parishes. The parish council for Dronfield takes the style &quot;town council&quot;.

Settlements in the district include:
* Arkwright Town and Ashover
* Barlow
* Calow and Clay Cross
* Dronfield
* Eckington
* Grassmoor
* Holmesfield, Holymoorside and Holmewood
* Killamarsh
* Morton
* North Wingfield
* Pilsley
* Renishaw and Ridgeway
* Shirland, Spinkhill and Stonebroom
* Tupton
* Wingerworth

==Coal mining==
The district, along with the district of Bolsover and adjoining areas in South Yorkshire, was a major producer of coal; a large seam of coal was discovered during the construction of the Clay Cross Tunnel in the 1830s. Coal mining became the main industry in the region.

On nationalisation in 1947 there were 27 coal mines in the Chesterfield area, reduced to 12 by 1980. During the 1980s the Conservative government planned to close down many of the remaining mines, leading to the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike. Members of North Derbyshire NUM were split over the strike, with a March 1984 area ballot, at the start of the strike, narrowly opposing it. It was however observed by the majority of North East Derbyshire miners, with all local pits initially closed. The strike caused massive poverty and social upheaval as traditionally close-knit communities became divided between those who worked and those who did not. The strike was resolved by the spring of 1985 and mine closures continued, with the closure of many associated industries. This decimated many local communities, with many former pit villages struggling to recover. The last Colliery in the area closed in 1993.

==Regeneration==
Following the closure of the pits large areas of the district were derelict, with old mine workings and spoil tips from 150 years of industrialisation. Over the last few years these sites have been remediated and regenerated by open cast mining of the remaining surface deposits and reclamation of coal from the old spoil heaps. The sites have then been restored as a mix of parkland, business parks, and housing sites. The work, part-funded by EEC Coalfield community regeneration grants, helped clean up the environmental legacy and fund the creation of job opportunities by providing the infrastructure for development. This resulted in several large and some smaller business parks, now providing thousands of jobs, albeit many in warehousing and distribution, not of the same skill level as the lost engineering jobs.

==Media==
In terms of television, North East Derbyshire is served by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire broadcasting from the Emley Moor transmitter.

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Derby
*BBC Radio Sheffield
*Greatest Hits Radio North Derbyshire
*Chesterfield Radio, a community based radio station that broadcast from Chesterfield.

&quot;Derbyshire Times&quot; is the weekly local newspaper that serves the district .

==Arms==

The council uses its coat of arms as its logo.

<doc id="352466" wikidata="Q2010254" url="?curid=352466" title="Tetramorph">
<text>A tetramorph is a symbolic arrangement of four differing elements, or the combination of four disparate elements in one unit. The term is derived from the Greek &quot;tetra&quot;, meaning four, and &quot;morph&quot;, shape.

The word comes from the Greek for &quot;four forms&quot; or &quot;shapes&quot;. In English usage, each symbol may be described as a tetramorph in the singular, and a group as &quot;the tetramorphs&quot;, but usually only in contexts where all four are included. The tetramorphs were especially common in Early Medieval art, above all in illuminated Gospel books, but remain common in religious art to the present day.

In Christian art, the tetramorph is the union of the symbols of the Four Evangelists, derived from the four living creatures in the Book of Ezekiel, into a single figure or, more commonly, a group of four figures. Each of the four Evangelists is associated with one of the living creatures, usually shown with wings. The most common association, but not the original or only, is: Mark the King, Lion; Luke the lowly Servant, Ox; Matthew the Angel; and John the Eagle. In Christian art and iconography, Evangelist portraits are often accompanied by tetramorphs, or the symbols alone used to represent them. Evangelist portraits that depict them in their human forms are often accompanied by their symbolic creatures, and Christ in Majesty is often shown surrounded by the four symbols.

==Origins==

Images of unions of different elements into one symbol were originally used by the Ancient Egyptians, Assyrians, and Greeks. The image of the sphinx, found in Egypt and Babylon, depicted the body of a lion and the head of a human, while the harpies of Greek mythology showed bird-like human women.

===Ezekiel&#x27;s living creatures===

The prophet Ezekiel lived among the Jews who were exiled to Babylon in the 6th century BC. The creatures in his vision, from which the images of the tetramorph are derived, are reminiscent of ancient Assyrian art.

The animals associated with the Christian tetramorph originate in the Babylonian symbols of the four fixed signs of the zodiac: the ox representing Taurus; the lion representing Leo; the eagle representing Scorpio; the man or angel representing Aquarius. In Western astrology, the four symbols are associated with the elements of, respectively Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. The creatures of the Christian tetramorph were also common in Egyptian, Greek, and Assyrian mythology. The early Christians adopted this symbolism and adapted it for the four Evangelists as the tetramorph, which first appears in Christian art in the 5th century, but whose interpretative origin stems from Irenaeus in the 2nd century.

The elements of the Christian tetramorph first appear in the vision of Ezekiel, who describes the four creatures as they appear to him in a vision:
They are described later in the Book of Revelation:
===The four evangelists as four living creatures===
The association of the four living creatures with the four evangelists originated with Irenaeus in the 2nd century. The interpretation of each creature has varied through church history. The most common interpretation, first laid out by Victorinus and adopted by Jerome, St Gregory, and the Book of Kells, is that the man is Matthew, the lion Mark, the ox Luke, and the eagle John. The creatures of the tetramorph, just like the four gospels of the Evangelists, represent four facets of Christ.

It is clear from the table that various interpretive schemes have been followed through church history. The five main schemes are summarized below with a representative proponent and rationale. The given rationale usually has to do with how each Gospel begins, major themes in each Gospel, or the aspect of Christ emphasized in each Gospel.

1st scheme—Irenaeus

The man is Matthew, because his Gospel begins with the genealogy of Jesus; the lion is John, because his Gospel begins full of confidence; the ox is Luke, because his Gospel begins with priestly sacrifice; and the eagle is Mark, because his Gospel begins with the prophecy of Isaiah. Irenaeus originates this connection between the four living creatures and the four evangelists because he is looking for an answer to the question &quot;Why four Gospels?&quot;

2nd scheme (most common)—Jerome

The rationale given for this scheme is how each Gospel narrative begins. Matthew is the man because he begins with a genealogy; Mark is the lion, roaring in the desert with prophetic power; Luke is the ox, because he begins with temple sacrifice; and John is the eagle, flying heavenwards like the divine Word. It must be said that at a certain point, once enough interpretive authorities in the church backed this scheme, many who followed simply defaulted to their authority.

3rd scheme—Augustine

The lion is Matthew, because Matthew&#x27;s Gospel depicts Christ royal character, he who descended from the tribe of Judah; the ox is Luke, because Christ is shown in his priestly character; the man is Mark, because of the humanity of Christ shown in that Gospel focusing on the things the man did; and the eagle is John, because the mystery of the Word ascends to heaven. Augustine departs from Jerome&#x27;s scheme saying, &quot;This latter formulation focuses only on the beginnings of the books and not on the overall plan of the evangelists, which is what should have been examined more thoroughly.&quot;

4th scheme—Jamieson-Fausset-Brown

The lion is Matthew, because Matthew portrays the Lord Jesus as the King; the ox is Mark, because Mark portrays Him as a servant; the man is Luke, because Luke portrays Him as a perfect, genuine man; the eagle is John, because John portrays Him as God. This view takes the creatures as symbols of &quot;not the personal character of the Evangelists, but the manifold aspect of Christ... presented by them severally.&quot;

5th scheme—Aimee Semple McPherson

The Eagle is Matthew, who presents Jesus as the King who will soon return to seek his people, Jesus Will Return; the ox is Luke, where he presents Jesus as the suffering servant who bore our sickness, Jesus Healing; The Face of Man (representing Mark) presents Jesus as the perfect man who came to save us, Jesus Saves; The Lion is John presents Jesus as the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit.

==The tetramorph in art==

===Representation and symbolism in Christianity===
The creatures of the tetramorph, as they appear in their animal forms, are predominantly shown as winged figures. The wings, an ancient symbol of divinity, represent the divinity of the Evangelists, the divine nature of Christ, and the virtues required for Christian salvation. In regards to the depiction of St Mark in particular, the use of wings distinguish him from images of St Jerome, who is also associated with the image of a lion.

The perfect human body of Christ was originally represented as a winged man, and was later adapted for St Matthew in order to symbolise Christ&#x27;s humanity. In the context of the tetramorphs, the winged man indicates Christ&#x27;s humanity and reason, as well as Matthew&#x27;s account of the Incarnation of Christ. The lion of St Mark represents courage, resurrection, and royalty, coinciding with the theme of Christ as king in Mark&#x27;s gospel. It is also interpreted as the Lion of Judah as a reference to Christ&#x27;s royal lineage. The ox, or bull, is an ancient Christian symbol of redemption and life through sacrifice, signifying Luke&#x27;s records of Christ as a priest and his ultimate sacrifice for the future of humanity. The eagle represents the sky, heavens, and the human spirit, paralleling the divine nature of Christ.

In their earliest appearances, the Evangelists were depicted in their human forms each with a scroll or a book to represent the Gospels. By the 5th century, images of the Evangelists evolved into their respective tetramorphs. By the later Middle Ages, the tetramorph in the form of creatures was used less frequently. Instead, the Evangelists were often shown in their human forms accompanied by their symbolic creatures, or as men with the heads of animals.

In images where the creatures surround Christ, the winged man and the eagle are often depicted at Christ&#x27;s sides, with the lion and the ox positioned lower by his feet, with the man on Christ&#x27;s right, taking precedence over the eagle, and the lion to the left of the ox. These positions reflect the medieval great chain of being.

===Depictions in Christian art===

====Architecture====

The use of the tetramorph in architecture is most common in the decoration of Christian churches. On medieval churches, the symbols of the Evangelists are usually found above westerly-facing portals and in the eastern apse, particularly surrounding the enthroned figure of Christ in Glory in scenes of the Last Judgment. This image of Christ in Glory often features Christ pantocrator in a mandorla surrounded by the creatures of the tetramorph is often found on the spherical ceiling inside the apse, typically as a mosaic or fresco. Older Roman churches, such as Santa Pudenziana and Santa Maria in Trastevere, mosaics often depict the four creatures in a straight line rather than in a circular formation.

Medieval churches also feature sculptures of bas-relief symbols of the Evangelists on western facades, externally around eastern apse windows, or as large statues atop apse walls. Generally all four creatures of the tetramorph will be found together in either one image or in one structure, but it is not unheard of to have a single Evangelist dominate the imagery of the church. This is usually found in cities that bear one of the Evangelists as their patron saint. A notable example is St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice, where the winged lion is the city&#x27;s mascot and St Mark is the city&#x27;s patron saint.

====Painting and manuscript illumination====

Most illuminated Gospel books were prefaced with Evangelist portraits, often combined on a single page. Insular manuscripts were very focused on abstract linear patterns that combined Mediterranean, Anglo-Saxon and Celtic influences, the latter mostly traceable from surviving metalwork. The artists of the period were initially more comfortable with images of animals than humans, so in early Gospel Books the Evangelists were represented as tetramorphic symbols rather than portraits. Their preferences for abstract, geometric, and stylized art led to a lot of differences in portrayals of the tetramorphs. Celtic artists would paint the creatures in a relatively realistic fashion, or their divine nature would be emphasised through the inclusion of wings or human traits, such as hands in place of talons or the animal standing upright.

The Evangelists and tetramorphs were highly featured in Ottonian manuscripts as the Gospel books, pericopes, and the Apocalypse were most popular. While they imitated the Byzantine artistic style, Carolingian illuminations consciously revived the early Christian style, and was much more elaborate than Celtic or Insular art.

For most illuminated manuscript portraits, the Evangelist typically occupied a full page. Though numerous examples of Late Antique portraits featured each figure in a standing position, the Evangelists were predominantly depicted in a seated position at a writing desk or with a book or scroll, both in reference to the Gospels. The symbols of the tetramorphs were most common in the Middle Ages until the Romanesque period before they fell out of favour and images of the Evangelists in their human forms became more common. However, the tetramorphs were still used and were found in artwork of the Renaissance and even in modern art. A notable 20th century example is the massive tapestry by Graham Sutherland which hangs in Coventry Cathedral.
===Other depictions===
The tetramorph of the four living creatures is depicted on the World card of many tarot decks, including the Tarot of Marseilles and the Rider-Waite tarot deck. It is also depicted in some Islamic art.

<text>The A68 is a major road in the United Kingdom, running from Darlington in England to the A720 in Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. It crosses the Anglo-Scottish border at Carter Bar and is the only road to do so for some distance either way; the next major crossings are the A697 from Coldstream to Cornhill-on-Tweed in the east, and the A7 near Canonbie to the west.

==Route==

The southernmost section of the A68, as it leaves Darlington, has been described as a &quot;rustbelt&quot;. In January 2022 there was a proposal to widen key roundabouts in Darlington to ease traffic flow. The road crosses the A1(M) at Copshaw Hill Interchange. It bypasses Bishop Auckland and runs through West Auckland, Toft Hill and Tow Law, where Durham County Council has installed a live camera so that drivers can check traffic and weather. It then passes Consett and Corbridge; it used to pass through the centre of the town but since 1979 has run on a bypass to the east, crossing the River Tyne over Styford Bridge. During the construction of the bypass, Roman burials, glass and coins were found, and some traces of Dere Street. To return to the previous route of the A68 it is concurrent with the A69 for , before turning off north again. The road passes through rural Northumberland, following the route of Dere Street for much of this stretch, which is considered highly scenic.

The A68 crosses the Scottish border at Carter Bar, then runs through the Border towns of Jedburgh, St Boswells, Earlston and Lauder before going over Soutra Hill, passing through Pathhead and by-passing Dalkeith, before terminating at Millerhill Junction on the A720. Until September 2008, the A68 passed through Dalkeith; the opening of a bypass removed large volumes of traffic from the town centre and led to a reduction in accidents. The northern section is used by commuters to Edinburgh, as well as long-distance traffic. 

In August 2020 part of the road near Fala collapsed after heavy rain. It reopened the following month.

Part of the A68 is a trunk road from the boundary with Midlothian to the border at Carter Bar, managed by BEAR Scotland for Transport Scotland. The English section as far south as the junction with the A696 to Newcastle was previously a trunk road, but was detrunked in 2001 as part of the government&#x27;s &quot;New Deal for Trunk Roads in England&quot; report published three years earlier.

Along with the A696, the A68 forms an alternative route between Newcastle Upon Tyne and Edinburgh to the A1 which runs along the coast via Berwick Upon Tweed, and is the more scenic of the two.

==History==
The A68 follows the Roman Dere Street north of Corbridge, crossing Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and shares its route as far as the historic camps of Habitancum and Bremenium. The area contains numerous Roman forts.

The current route across Carter Bar was proposed by John Loudon McAdam in 1828. It was constructed over the following decade, and featured bridges designed by James Jardine.

==Safety==
The A68 was the 20th most dangerous UK road in 2017. In 2021, the Scottish government announced funding for safety improvements in Pathhead. In England, some MPs have lobbied for similar safety improvements along the road.

<text>Frank Charles Laubach (September 2, 1884 – June 11, 1970), from Benton, Pennsylvania was a Congregational Christian missionary educated at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University, and a mystic known as &quot;The to the Illiterates.&quot; In 1915 (see Laubach, Thirty Years With the Silent Billion), while working among Muslims at a remote location in the Philippines, he developed the &quot;Each One Teach One&quot; literacy program. It has been used to teach about 60 million people to read in their own language. He was deeply concerned about poverty, injustice and illiteracy, and considered them barriers to peace in the world.

In 1955, he founded Laubach Literacy, which helped introduce about 150,000 Americans to reading each year and had grown to embrace 34 developing countries. An estimated 2.7 million people worldwide were learning to read through Laubach-affiliated programs. In 2002, this group merged with Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. to form ProLiteracy Worldwide.

During the latter years of his life, Laubach traveled all over the world speaking on the topics of literacy and world peace. He was the author of a number of devotional writings and works on literacy.

One of his most widely influential devotional works was a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Game with Minutes.&quot; In it, Laubach urged Christians to attempt to keep God in mind for at least one second of every minute of the day. In this way, Christians can attempt the attitude of constant prayer spoken of in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians. The pamphlet extolled the virtues of a life lived with an unceasing focus on God. Laubach&#x27;s insight came from his experiments in prayer detailed in a collection of his letters published under the title, &quot;Letters by a Modern Mystic&quot;.

Laubach is the only American missionary to be honored on a US postage stamp, a 30¢ Great Americans series stamp in 1984.

Laubach had a deep interest in the Philippines. He wrote a biography of the Filipino national hero, &quot;Jose Rizal: Man and Martyr,&quot; published in Manila in 1936. He also translated the hero&#x27;s valedictory poem, &quot;Mi Ultimo Adios&quot; (My Last Farewell). His version is ranked second in ideas, content, rhyme, and style among the 35 English translations in a collection.

He was a pioneer mover of Maranao literature. He wrote:

The Moro people of Lake Lanao have amazingly rich literature, all the more amazing since it exists only in the memories of the people and had just begun to be recorded in writing. It consists of lyric and poetry with the epic greatly predominating.

His emphasis on the use of Easy English for literacy led directly to the development by WEC International in 1962 of an evangelistic paper using his basic vocabulary called SOON! which printed about 3 million copies a year and distributed worldwide by post, until it ceased in 2015. He also trained ex-missionary Fred Morris in the use of Worldwide Easy English for his Bible teaching commentaries written in the USA in the 1990s and published by Manna Publications (UK) since the year 2000 .

<text>Sir David Michael Davis (born 23 December 1948) is an English Conservative Party politician serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Goole and Pocklington. He was previously the MP for Haltemprice and Howden and, before that, for Boothferry, where he was first elected in 1987. He served as Shadow Home Secretary from 2003 to 2008 and Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union from 2016 to 2018. Davis was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1997 New Year Honours, while surviving as Minister of State for Europe, a role he held from 1994 to 1997.

Brought up on the Aboyne Estate, a council estate in Tooting, south-west London, he attended Bec Grammar School. Later he earned an MBA from London Business School and worked for Tate &amp; Lyle. Having entered Parliament in 1987, he was appointed Europe Minister by Prime Minister John Major in July 1994. He held that position until the 1997 general election. He was subsequently Chairman of the Conservative Party and Shadow Secretary of State for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister under Iain Duncan Smith.

Between 2003 and 2008 he was the Shadow Home Secretary in the Shadow Cabinets of both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Davis had previously been a candidate in the 2001 and 2005 Conservative Party leadership elections, coming fourth and second respectively. On 12 June 2008 Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary; this was in order to force a by-election in his seat, for which he intended to seek reelection by mounting a specific campaign designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Following his formal resignation as an MP he became the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election, which he won a month later.

In July 2016, following the Brexit referendum, Davis was appointed by the new prime minister, Theresa May, to the new Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) as Secretary of State, with responsibility for negotiating the UK&#x27;s prospective exit from the EU. He was sidelined mid-way through the talks, with the Prime Minister&#x27;s Europe Adviser Olly Robbins taking charge of negotiations. Davis resigned from his government position on 8 July 2018 over May&#x27;s Brexit strategy and the Chequers plan. Following his resignation, the DExEU junior minister Steve Baker and the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also resigned.

== Early life and career ==
David Davis was born on 23 December 1948 in York to a single mother, Betty Brown. He was initially raised by his grandparents, with his maternal grandfather, Walter Harrison, the son of a wealthy trawlerman, but was disinherited after joining the Communist Party; he led a &quot;hunger march&quot; to London shortly after the more famous Jarrow March, which did not allow Communists to participate. His father, whom he met once after his mother&#x27;s death, was Welsh. After his mother married Ronald Davis the family moved to London, where they lived initially in a flat in Wandsworth, which Davis has described as &quot;a terrible little slum&quot;. Later, after his half-sister was born, the family moved to a council estate in Tooting, his stepfather being a shop steward at Battersea Power Station.

Davis went to Bec Grammar School in Tooting, and when he left, his A Level results were not good enough to secure a university place. He subsequently worked as an insurance clerk and became a soldier in the Territorial Army&#x27;s 21 SAS (Artists) to earn the money needed to retake his examinations. After doing so he won a place at the University of Warwick, where he graduated with a BSc Joint Hons in Molecular Science and Computer Science in 1971. While at Warwick he was one of the founding members of the student radio station, University Radio Warwick. While a student, Davis was active in the Federation of Conservative Students, becoming national chairman in 1973. Davis worked for Tate &amp; Lyle for 17 years, rising to become a senior executive, including restructuring its troubled Canadian subsidiary, Redpath Sugar. He wrote about his business experiences in the 1988 book &quot;How to Turn Round a Company&quot;.

== Parliamentary career ==
Davis was first elected to Parliament in the 1987 general election as the MP for Boothferry, when he was elected with 55.7% of the vote and a majority of 18,970. At the 1992 general election, Davis was re-elected as MP for Boothferry with a decreased vote share of 54.8% and a decreased majority of 17,535. Davis&#x27;s constituency of Boothferry was abolished in 1997 and replaced with the new constituency of Haltemprice and Howden. At the 1997 general election, Davis was elected as MP for Haltemprice and Howden, winning with 44% of the vote and a majority of 7,514.

In 1999, Davis presented the Parliamentary Control of the Executive Bill to the House of Commons, in which he proposed to transfer ministerial exercise of the Royal Prerogative to the Commons in the following areas: the signing of treaties; the diplomatic recognition of foreign governments; European Union legislation; the appointment of ministers, peers and ambassadors; the establishment of Royal Commissions; the proclamation of Orders in Council unless subject to resolutions of the Commons; the exercise of the powers of the executive not made by statute; the declarations of states of emergency; the dissolution of parliament.

At the 2001 general election, Davis was re-elected as MP for Haltemprice and Howden with a decreased vote share of 43.2% and a decreased majority of 1,903. He rejected a shadow ministerial position under William Hague, opting instead to chair the Public Accounts Committee. Davis used his first interview as Shadow Home Secretary in November 2003 to state his personal support for a reintroduction of the death penalty for people convicted of multiple murder &quot;where there is clear evidence and no doubt&quot; surrounding the offender&#x27;s guilt, citing the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe and Moors Murderer Ian Brady as examples of offenders who would fall into that category. This interview came almost 40 years after the abolition of the death penalty for murder.

At the 2005 general election, Davis was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 47.5% and an increased majority of 5,116 votes. Davis believed that once the true cost and unreliability of the ID card scheme was explained to the general public they would turn against it. He was also credited by some commentators with &quot;claiming the scalps&quot; of two Labour ministers, David Blunkett and Beverley Hughes, after both were forced to resign.

=== 2005 leadership contest ===
At the time of the 2005 Conservative leadership contest, David Davis was Shadow Secretary of State for the Home Department. His campaign manager in the contest was Conservative MP and Davis&#x27; deputy as Shadow Home Secretary, Andrew Mitchell (who in 2010 became Secretary of State for International Development in Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s cabinet). Davis was initially the front runner in the contest, but after a poorly received speech at that year&#x27;s Conservative Party Conference his campaign was seen to lose momentum.

Referring to a Conference speech by the party&#x27;s former leader, campaign manager Andrew Mitchell said: &quot;William Hague made a great speech which many people will judge to be better than all the other leadership candidates put together. What that tells you is that being absolutely brilliant at being able to make a speech at conference is not the be-all-and-end-all of leadership. There are other things as well.&quot; He was photographed at the conference alongside two women wearing T-shirts emblazoned with &quot;It&#x27;s DD for me&quot; which was viewed by some women as being patronising to them.

In the first ballot of Conservative MPs on 18 October 2005, Davis came top with 62 votes. As this was less than the number of his declared supporters, it became clear that the Davis bid was losing momentum. The elimination of former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke left the bookmakers&#x27; favourite, David Cameron, without a rival in the centre of the party. In the second ballot, held two days later, Cameron polled 90 votes, Davis 57 votes and Liam Fox was eliminated with 51 votes, so Davis went through to the next stage with Cameron.

Despite a strong performance in a BBC &quot;Question Time&quot; head-to-head debate in the final stage of the leadership contest, Davis could not match his rival&#x27;s general popularity. Conservative Party members voted to elect Cameron the new Conservative leader, Davis losing with 64,398 votes against Cameron&#x27;s 134,446 votes. Cameron chose to re-appoint his rival as Shadow Home Secretary following his victory. As Shadow Home Secretary, Davis turned the Conservatives away from the Labour Party&#x27;s plan to reintroduce identity cards, citing spiralling costs and libertarian issues.

===Alleged role in leaking of government documents===
Davis is alleged to have played a role in the leaking of sensitive government documents when he was Shadow Home Secretary in 2007. According to a police statement, under interview after arrest, civil servant Christopher Galley said Davis was his first contact and that he (Davis) introduced him to Damian Green, the Shadow Immigration spokesman. Galley initially approached Davis stating he had access to government immigration details which he was willing to leak to help the Conservative Party. Under questioning by police Galley said that Green told him &quot;do not mention Davis&quot;. In April 2009, following a disciplinary hearing, Galley was dismissed from his job as a junior Home Office official for leaking information to Green.

=== Civil liberties ===

On 12 June 2008, Davis resigned from the Shadow Cabinet and announced his resignation as an MP, in order to force a by-election, and cause a wider debate on the single issue of what he believed to be the erosion of civil liberties. On 18 June 2008, he resigned from the House of Commons. He stood as the Conservative Party candidate for his current seat in the subsequent by-election. The announcement came a day after the narrow passing of a parliamentary vote on the Counter-Terrorism Bill, which would extend the limit on the period of detention of terror suspects without charge in England and Wales, from 28 to 42 days. Davis won re-election with an increased vote share of 71.6% and an increased majority of 15,355 votes, but neither the Labour Party nor the Liberal Democrats put up a candidate. As is common at by-elections, voter turnout declined significantly from the previous general election to 34%.

At the time of Davis&#x27;s resignation, the Labour MP Andy Burnham made a speech which was widely interpreted as falsely implying an inappropriate relationship between Davis and the then Director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti. Burnham was forced to issue a public apology under threat of legal action. As a backbench MP, Davis continued campaigning for civil liberties. He participated in the Convention on Modern Liberty, where he gave the keynote speech on the convention&#x27;s final day. He also spoke at the 2009 Guardian Hay Festival, where he criticised Labour&#x27;s &quot;illusory pursuit of an unobtainable security&quot;, and was well received by an overwhelmingly non-Conservative audience. On 15 June 2009, Davis gave the 2009 Magna Carta Lecture at Royal Holloway, University of London, in association with the Magna Carta Trust.

Davis supported civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch and in January 2010 he spoke with Tony Benn at the official launch. In 2012 he helped lead the opposition to Coalition plans to allow police and security services to extend their monitoring of the public&#x27;s email and social media communications. He expressed concern with the findings of a VICE News investigation into the deployment of IMSI-catchers in London. In 2014, along with Labour MP Tom Watson, he challenged the government&#x27;s introduction of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 in the courts. Although Davis is a staunch Eurosceptic and has criticised the record of the European Court of Human Rights, he has also argued against withdrawal from the court&#x27;s jurisdiction, on the basis it might encourage countries with far worse civil liberties to do likewise.

Davis has been outspoken over UK government data deals, particularly those with Palantir Technologies. In 2021 Davis said of Palantir&#x27;s involvement with the NHS, &quot;Patient trust is vital to our NHS, so foreign tech companies such as Palantir, with their history of supporting mass surveillance, assisting in drone strikes, immigration raids and predictive policing, must not be placed at the heart of our NHS.&quot; Davis again criticised Palantir&#x27;s involvement with the NHS in 2023 during the procurement process for a £480 million contract for a company to create a Federated Data Platform for NHS England. Davis has taken more conservative stances on some other civil liberties issues, having repeatedly voted to restrict abortion, fertility treatment and embryo research. He also repeatedly voted against the furthering of LGBT rights, including supporting the controversial Section 28, which banned teachers from &quot;promoting homosexuality&quot; or &quot;teaching ... the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship&quot;, and opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage saying it was &quot;not an issue of rights but a clash of beliefs&quot;.

=== Allegations of torture===
During a House of Commons debate on 7 July 2009, Davis accused the UK government of outsourcing torture, by allowing Rangzieb Ahmed to leave the country (even though the government had evidence against Ahmed, upon which Ahmed was later convicted for terrorism) to Pakistan, where it is said the Inter-Services Intelligence was given the go-ahead by the British intelligence agencies to torture Ahmed. Davis further accused the government of trying to gag Ahmed, stopping him coming forward with his accusations after he had been imprisoned back in the UK. He said, there was &quot;an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture: if he did that, they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money. If this request to drop the torture case is true, it is frankly monstrous. It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the Government&#x27;s Contest strategy, and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.&quot; Davis was amongst the signatories of a letter in 2012 to &quot;The Guardian&quot; condemning the Coalition&#x27;s efforts to hide the UK&#x27;s involvement in rendition and torture behind secret trials.

=== Coalition government (2010–2015) ===
Davis was again re-elected at the 2010 general election, with a decreased vote share of 50.2% and a decreased majority of 11,602 votes. In May 2010, with the result of a hung parliament, it was reported that David Cameron wanted to invite Davis and other right-wingers such as Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith into his Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition cabinet. However, Davis declined and remained a critic of the government on its stance on tuition fees. In January 2011, along with Jack Straw, he secured a vote in the Commons to challenge a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that prisoners should be allowed to vote and MPs subsequently chose to ignore the ruling. He offered critical commentary on the coalition in a BBC interview in March 2012.

In 2012, together with Liam Fox, Davis founded Conservative pressure group Conservative Voice to amplify the voice of grassroots members, which Davis thought was getting lost in the party. In a November 2012 speech, he urged David Cameron to hold a referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the EU by 2014. He suggested to hold two votes, the first where voters would be asked whether they wanted to renegotiate current EU arrangements, and a second where they would be asked to either accept a renegotiated deal or leave the EU altogether. At the 2015 general election, Davis was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 54.2% and an increased majority of 16,195. Also in 2015, he was one of seven Conservative MPs to defy the whip and vote against bombing Syria.

=== Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (2016–2018) ===
Following Theresa May&#x27;s appointment as prime minister, Davis was appointed Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (Brexit Secretary) on 13 July 2016. He published in ConservativeHome his initial thoughts on the way Brexit might proceed. In his role as Brexit Secretary, Davis announced that Parliament will take action on translating EU laws into British laws as part of the process of Withdrawal from the European Union. Davis stated that the Brexit timetable discussion would be the &quot;row of the summer&quot; during a TV interview with Robert Peston on &quot;Peston on Sunday&quot;. The timetable was set on the first day of negotiations and it was dictated by the EU. Following the Article 50 vote in February 2017, Davis was involved in a controversy with fellow MP Diane Abbott.

Davis was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 61% and a decreased majority of 15,405 votes. On 7 September 2017, the European Commission published the minutes of a meeting in July at which Michel Barnier, the EU&#x27;s chief Brexit negotiator, briefed the commission on the outcome of his first round of talks with Davis. Barnier expressed concern about Davis&#x27;s commitment to the talks (he had been going to Brussels for the start and end of each round of talks, but had not been staying there for the duration).

In November 2017, Davis acknowledged that the negotiations with the EU were difficult, but appealed to European countries not to &quot;put politics above prosperity&quot;, implying that by doing so, countries like Germany would harm their own economies. He blamed Germany and France for blocking trade negotiations. Davis also argued that the UK and the EU should agree a free trade deal more comprehensive in scope than &quot;any the EU has agreed before&quot;.

Some politicians were angry because reports about the potential effect of Brexit on 58 economic sectors were severely edited before Davis gave them to the Exiting the European Union Select Committee. They maintained Davis – and by implication Theresa May&#x27;s government – chose to disregard a binding and unanimous vote from MPs requiring the information to be provided in full. Davis later appeared to contradict his earlier assurances that impact analyses had been carried out when he said the government had not produced any economic forecasts of what would happen after the UK leaves the EU.

David was sidelined in December 2017, mid-way through the negotiations, with the Prime Minister&#x27;s Europe Adviser Olly Robbins taking charge of negotiations. In January 2018, former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Davis did not understand the implications of Brexit for Ireland&#x27;s border with Northern Ireland. On 8 July 2018, Davis resigned as Brexit Secretary as he did not &quot;believe&quot; in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Chequers plan for Brexit. Following Davis&#x27; resignation, Steve Baker and Boris Johnson also resigned.

=== Since 2018 ===
On 20 November 2018, Davis was criticised by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, of the pro-EU group Best for Britain, for suggesting that the UK could negotiate a free trade agreement during a post-Brexit &quot;transition period&quot; without first having successfully negotiated a withdrawal agreement with the European Union. Following Theresa May&#x27;s resignation in May 2019, Davis supported Dominic Raab as the next leader of the Conservative Party. Davis was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with an increased vote share of 62.4% and an increased majority of 20,329 votes. He has opposed the proposed extradition of Julian Assange to the United States. Davis has also been prominent in opposing the plans of the Johnson administration to privatise NHS data, advocating more transparency in the management of patient data.

On 17 March 2021, Davis used parliamentary privilege to criticise the Scottish Government&#x27;s investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by former First Minister Alex Salmond. Davis, a close personal friend of Salmond, told MPs during a Commons debate that there had been a &quot;concerted effort&quot; by SNP officials to encourage complainers to come forward, and that Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, had been involved in the civil service investigation into Salmond in February 2018 – months before Nicola Sturgeon claimed to have known about the investigation. He told the House of Commons, &quot;I have it on good authority that there exists from 6th Feb 2018 an exchange of messages between civil servants suggesting that the first minister&#x27;s chief of staff is interfering in the complaints process against Alex Salmond. If true this suggests the chief of staff had knowledge of the case in February, not April as she has claimed.&quot; Nicola Sturgeon rejected Davis&#x27; claims, and one of the women who had accused Salmond of sexual harassment issued a statement through Rape Crisis Scotland calling Davis&#x27; claims &quot;fundamentally untrue&quot;.

During Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions on 19 January 2022, Davis asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign, after expressing dissatisfaction with his response to Partygate. He quoted what Leo Amery (alluding to Oliver Cromwell) had said to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in 1940: &quot;You have sat there too long for all the good you have done. In the name of God, go.&quot; On 2 October 2022, Davis wrote an article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; which advocated for reform of the National Health Service and the adoption of a social insurance-based system. He wrote that the NHS was &quot;plagued by ineffective bureaucracy&quot; and that structural reform did not mean that the principles of the NHS being universal and free at the point of delivery needed to be abandoned.

Due to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Davis&#x27; constituency of Haltemprice and Howden was abolished, and replaced with Goole and Pocklington. At the 2024 general election, Davis was elected to Parliament as MP for Goole and Pocklington with 38.2% of the vote and a majority of 3,572. Since May 2024, Davis has expressed doubts about the conviction of former nurse Lucy Letby and has said he intends to thoroughly research the issue and discuss it in parliament. On 18 July 2024, Davis again used parliamentary privilege to name Liz Lloyd, Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s ex-chief of staff, as the person responsible for leaking sexual misconduct allegations against Alex Salmond to the &quot;Daily Record&quot; in 2018.

== Personal life ==
Davis met his wife, Doreen Cook, at Warwick. They married on 28 July 1973 and have three children. Davis was a close personal friend of former leader of the Scottish National Party and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond, and has twice used parliamentary privilege to criticise the Scottish Government&#x27;s investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by Salmond. When Salmond died in 2024, Davis paid tribute to him as &quot;one of the great politicians of his age&quot; and &quot;a great leader for his country&quot;. In December 2023, Davis fought off street attackers who were kicking a man, near Parliament. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 2023 Political Honours for public and political service.

<doc id="352476" wikidata="Q4649612" url="?curid=352476" title="A77 road">
<text>The A77 road is a major road in Scotland. It runs in a southwesterly direction from the city of Glasgow, past the towns of Giffnock, Newton Mearns, Kilmarnock, Prestwick, Ayr, Girvan and Stranraer to the village of Portpatrick on the Irish Sea. It passes through the council areas of Glasgow City, East Renfrewshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway.

It has full trunk road status from the terminus of the M77 motorway at Fenwick to the junction with the A75 in Stranraer. Some sections - most notably those between Turnberry and Girvan, and thereon to Ballantrae, run directly on the coastline with scenic views over the Firth of Clyde and the Irish Sea. The section between Cairnryan and Stranraer runs on the shore of Loch Ryan.

The A77 is an important link from Glasgow to one of its two major airports, Prestwick Airport, and to the two Northern Ireland ferry terminals at Cairnryan. As a result, the road is subject to a busy mixture of commuter, tourist and heavy goods vehicle traffic which has necessitated upgrades to many sections.

== History ==

Bypasses for Ayr and Kilmarnock were built in the 1970s, and the M77 motorway replaced the Glasgow to Newton Mearns section in two stages, in the mid-to-late 1990s, but not without controversy as a section of the motorway was routed through Pollok Country Park.

This still left the East Ayrshire and southern East Renfrewshire stretch of the road which widely appeared in statistics as one of the most dangerous sections of road in Scotland. The majority of this section was an unsegregated, four-lane single carriageway between Kilmarnock and Newton Mearns and the lanes were narrow compared to the standard of other major roads. At several points, it was common for traffic waiting to turn right to queue in the overtaking lane. The speed limit of was widely ignored. Finally, the road narrowed to only two lanes near Newton Mearns, causing long queues.

The combined result was a number of fatal crashes. The Scottish Executive took the decision to replace the entire section up to the Kilmarnock bypass with an extension of the M77 after pressure and campaigning from West Sound and West FM. This section was built in tandem with the A726 Glasgow Southern Orbital which provided a new direct connection between the M77/A77 and East Kilbride, thus diverted most of the southbound traffic bound for the A77 away from the B764 Eaglesham Moor route, and particular removed its dangerous junction with the A77 which was the site of many fatal accidents.

Construction of the motorway was faster than usual, given the eagerness to replace the A77 after another fatal crash in June 2002 resulted in the death of Hugh Davidson, then Chief Inspector of Strathclyde Police, and the motorway was opened in April 2005. This completed a continuous dual carriageway road from Glasgow to Ayr. The original section of the A77 between Newton Mearns and Fenwick was downgraded to a local access route, with one half of the former four lane single carriageway converted to a cycle path.

In an effort to prevent a repeat of the fatalities on the southern section of the road, July 2005 saw the A77 become host to the largest automatic speed limit enforcement system in the whole of the UK. Based on the digital SPECS system rather than the traditional fixed post GATSO film cameras, gantries with automatic numberplate recognition cameras are sited on the road at intervals of between and measure the average speed of traffic. The enforced zone stretches from the Bogend Toll Junction (Dundonald/Tarbolton junction) at its northern end on the dual carriageway section, down to just north of Lendalfoot; a distance of around .

From 10 March 2008 a long term temporary limit from Bogend Toll to Dutch House Roundabout was introduced, following the death in October 2006 of another police officer, Constable Kevin Lowe. Constable Lowe was on duty and en route at approximately in an unmarked car to a call at the time. This speed limit was to remain in force until new grade separated junctions were opened in 2014. It&#x27;s still in force.

There have been continued efforts to improve the road in the south. In the early 1990s, a 2km section south of Lendalfoot and just north of Ballantrae was rediverted further back from the coastline at Snib&#x27;s Cave due to coastal erosion and to provide a climbing lane to improve overtaking opportunities. Over a decade later, another such project was the Turnberry Climbing Lane which opened in 2005, has enhanced guaranteed overtaking opportunities on the single carriageway section. Another improvement opened in Autumn 2006, the upgraded Whitletts roundabout with traffic lights and spiral lanes. Climbing lanes were added at Haggstone and Drummuckloch and a stretch was straightened north of nearby Glenapp in autumn 2008. In 2011 a stretch was widened from Park End to Bennane.

In 2022, a bypass opened at Maybole. The bypass was constructed to the west of the town from 2019 and was initially intended to open in Summer 2021. The bypass is expected to improve traffic flow and decrease traffic through Maybole&#x27;s town centre.

The A77 was formerly part of the Euroroute system, and comprised route E111.

<doc id="352479" wikidata="Q867316" url="?curid=352479" title="Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire">
<text>The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, on Saturday, March 25, 1911, was the deadliest industrial disaster in the history of the city, and one of the deadliest in U.S. history. The fire caused the deaths of 146 garment workers—123 women and girls and 23 men—who died from the fire, smoke inhalation, falling, or jumping to their deaths. Most of the victims were recent Italian or Jewish immigrant women and girls aged 14 to 23; of the victims whose ages are known, the oldest victim was 43-year-old Providenza Panno and the youngest were 14-year-olds Kate Leone and Rosaria &quot;Sara&quot; Maltese.

The factory was located on the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the Asch Building, which had been built in 1901. Later renamed the &quot;Brown Building&quot;, it still stands at 23–29 Washington Place near Washington Square Park, on the New York University (NYU) campus. The building has been designated a National Historic Landmark and a New York City landmark.

Because the doors to the stairwells and exits were locked—a common practice at the time to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft—many of the workers could not escape from the burning building and jumped from the high windows. There were no sprinklers in the building. The fire led to legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped spur the growth of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU), which fought for better working conditions for sweatshop workers.

==Background==
The Triangle Waist Company factory occupied the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the 10-story Asch Building on the northwest corner of Greene Street and Washington Place, just east of Washington Square Park, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. Under the ownership of Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, the factory produced women&#x27;s blouses, known as &quot;shirtwaists&quot;. The factory normally employed about 500 workers, mostly young Italian and Jewish immigrant women and girls, who worked nine hours a day on weekdays plus seven hours on Saturdays, earning for their 52 hours of work between $7 and $12 a week, the equivalent of $ to $ a week in currency, or $ to $ per hour. Owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris were said to have preferred hiring immigrant women over men, because they would work for less, and were less likely to unionize against them. These women were often poor, young, had little to no education and barely spoke English. 

==Fire==
At approximately 4:40 pm on Saturday, March 25, 1911, as the workday was ending, a fire flared up in a scrap bin under one of the cutter&#x27;s tables at the northeast corner of the 8th floor. The first fire alarm was sent at 4:45 pm by a passerby on Washington Place who saw smoke coming from the 8th floor. Both owners of the factory were in attendance and had invited their children to the factory on that afternoon.

The Fire Marshal concluded that the likely cause of the fire was the disposal of an unextinguished match or cigarette butt in a scrap bin containing two months&#x27; worth of accumulated cuttings. Beneath the table in the wooden bin were hundreds of pounds of scraps left over from the several thousand shirtwaists that had been cut at that table. The scraps piled up from the last time the bin was emptied, coupled with the hanging fabrics that surrounded it; the steel trim was the only thing that was not highly flammable.

Although smoking was banned in the factory, cutters were known to sneak cigarettes, exhaling the smoke through their lapels to avoid detection. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article suggested that the fire had been started by the engines running the sewing machines. A series of articles in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; noted a pattern of arson among certain sectors of the garment industry whenever their particular product fell out of fashion or had excess inventory in order to collect insurance. &quot;The Insurance Monitor&quot;, a leading industry journal, observed that shirtwaists had recently fallen out of fashion, and that insurance for manufacturers of them was &quot;fairly saturated with moral hazard&quot;. Although Blanck and Harris were known for having had four previous suspicious fires at their companies, arson was not suspected in this case.


A bookkeeper on the 8th floor was able to warn employees on the 10th floor via telephone, but there was no audible alarm and no way to contact staff on the 9th floor. According to survivor Yetta Lubitz, the first warning of the fire on the 9th floor arrived at the same time as the fire itself.

Although the floor had a number of exits, including two freight elevators, a fire escape, and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place, flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway, and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft by the workers; the locked doors allowed managers to check the women&#x27;s purses. Various historians have also ascribed the exit doors being locked to management&#x27;s wanting to keep out union organizers because of management&#x27;s anti-union bias. The foreman who held the stairway door key had already escaped by another route. Dozens of employees escaped the fire by going up the Greene Street stairway to the roof. Other survivors were able to jam themselves into the elevators for as long as they continued to operate.

Within three minutes of the fire starting, the Greene Street stairway became unusable in both directions. Terrified employees crowded onto the single exterior fire escape—which city officials had allowed Asch to erect instead of the required third staircase—a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure that may have already been broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. The remainder of the victims jumped to their deaths to escape the fire or were eventually overcome by smoke and flames.

The fire department arrived quickly but was unable to stop the flames, as the department&#x27;s ladders were long enough to reach only as high as the 7th floor. The fallen bodies and falling victims also made it difficult for the fire department to approach the building.

Elevator operators Joseph Zito and Gaspar Mortillaro saved many lives by traveling three times up to the 9th floor for passengers, but Mortillaro was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the elevator car and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt.

William Gunn Shepherd, a reporter at the tragedy, would say, &quot;I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description can picture—the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk&quot;. A large crowd of bystanders gathered on the street, witnessing 62 people jumping or falling to their deaths from the burning building. Louis Waldman, later a New York Socialist state assemblyman, described the scene years later:

==Aftermath==
Although early estimates of the death toll ranged from 141 to 148, almost all modern references agree that 146 people died as a result of the fire: 123 women and girls and 23 men. Most victims died of burns, asphyxiation, blunt impact injuries, or a combination of the three.

The first person to jump was a man, and another man was seen kissing a young woman at a window before they both jumped to their deaths.

Bodies of victims were taken to Charities Pier (also called Misery Lane), located at 26th Street and the East River, for identification by friends and relatives. Victims were interred in 16 different cemeteries. Twenty-two victims of the fire were buried by the Hebrew Free Burial Association in a special section at Mount Richmond Cemetery. In some instances, their tombstones refer to the fire. Six victims remained unidentified until 2011, when Michael Hirsch, a historian, completed four years of researching newspaper articles and other sources for missing persons and was able to identify each of them by name. Those six victims were buried together in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn. Originally interred elsewhere on the grounds, their remains now lie beneath a monument to the tragedy, a large marble slab featuring a kneeling woman.

==Consequences==
The company&#x27;s owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris—both Jewish immigrants—who survived the fire by fleeing to the building&#x27;s roof when it began, were indicted on charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter in mid-April; the pair&#x27;s trial began on December 4, 1911. Max Steuer, counsel for the defendants, managed to destroy the credibility of one of the survivors, Kate Alterman, by asking her to repeat her testimony a number of times, which she did without altering key phrases. Steuer argued to the jury that Alterman and possibly other witnesses had memorized their statements and might even have been told what to say by the prosecutors. The prosecution charged that the owners knew that the exit doors were locked at the time in question. The investigation found that the locks were intended to be locked during working hours based on the findings from the fire, but the defense stressed that the prosecution failed to prove that the owners knew that. The jury acquitted the two men of first- and second-degree manslaughter, but they were found liable of wrongful death during a subsequent civil suit in 1913 in which plaintiffs were awarded compensation in the amount of $75 per deceased victim. The insurance company paid Blanck and Harris about $60,000 more than the reported losses, or about $400 per casualty.

Rose Schneiderman, a prominent socialist and union activist, gave a speech at the memorial meeting held in the Metropolitan Opera House on April 2, 1911, to an audience largely made up of members of the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League. She used the fire as an argument for factory workers to organize:

Others in the community, and in particular in the ILGWU, believed that political reform could help. In New York City, a Committee on Public Safety was formed, headed by eyewitness Frances Perkins—who 22 years later would be appointed United States Secretary of Labor—to identify specific problems and lobby for new legislation, such as the bill to grant workers shorter hours in a work week, known as the &quot;54-hour Bill&quot;. The committee&#x27;s representatives in Albany obtained the backing of Tammany Hall&#x27;s Al Smith, the Majority Leader of the Assembly, and Robert F. Wagner, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and this collaboration of machine politicians and reformers—also known as &quot;do-gooders&quot; or &quot;goo-goos&quot;—got results, especially since Tammany&#x27;s chief, Charles F. Murphy, realized the goodwill to be had as champion of the downtrodden.

The New York State Legislature then created the Factory Investigating Commission to &quot;investigate factory conditions in this and other cities and to report remedial measures of legislation to prevent hazard or loss of life among employees through fire, unsanitary conditions, and occupational diseases.&quot; The Commission was chaired by Wagner and co-chaired by Al Smith. They held a series of widely publicized investigations around the state, interviewing 222 witnesses and taking 3,500 pages of testimony. They hired field agents to do on-site inspections of factories. They started with the issue of fire safety and moved on to broader issues of the risks of injury in the factory environment. Their findings led to thirty-eight new laws regulating labor in New York state, and gave them a reputation as leading progressive reformers working on behalf of the working class. In the process, they changed Tammany&#x27;s reputation from mere corruption to progressive endeavors to help the workers. New York City&#x27;s Fire Chief John Kenlon told the investigators that his department had identified more than 200 factories where conditions made a fire like that at the Triangle Factory possible. The State Commissions&#x27;s reports helped modernize the state&#x27;s labor laws, making New York State &quot;one of the most progressive states in terms of labor reform.&quot; New laws mandated better building access and egress, fireproofing requirements, the availability of fire extinguishers, the installation of alarm systems and automatic sprinklers, and better eating and toilet facilities for workers, and limited the number of hours that women and children could work. From 1911 to 1913, 60 of the 64 new laws recommended by the Commission were legislated with the support of Governor William Sulzer.

As a result of the fire, the American Society of Safety Professionals was founded in New York City on October 14, 1911.

Harris and Blanck, after their acquittal, worked to rebuild their business, opening a factory at 16th Street and Fifth Avenue. In the summer of 1913, Blanck was once again arrested for locking the door in the factory during working hours. He was fined $20, which was the minimum amount the fine could be.

In 1918, the two partners closed the Triangle Waist Company and went their separate ways. Harris resumed working as a tailor, while Blanck set up other companies with his brothers, the most prominent of which was Normandy Waist Company, which earned a modest profit.

==Legacy==
The last living survivor of the fire was Rose Freedman, née Rosenfeld, who died in Beverly Hills, California, on February 15, 2001, at the age of 107. She was two days away from her 18th birthday at the time of the fire, which she survived by following the company&#x27;s executives and being rescued from the roof of the building. As a result of her experience, she became a lifelong supporter of unions.

On September 16, 2019, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered a speech in Washington Square Park supporting her presidential campaign, a few blocks from the location of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Sen. Warren recounted the story of the fire and its legacy before a crowd of supporters, likening activism for workers&#x27; rights after the 1911 fire to her own presidential platform.

==Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition==
The Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition is an alliance of more than 200 organizations and individuals formed in 2008 to encourage and coordinate nationwide activities commemorating the centennial of the fire and to create a permanent public art memorial to honor its victims. The founding partners included Workers United, the New York City Fire Museum, New York University (the current owner of the building), Workmen&#x27;s Circle, Museum at Eldridge Street, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, the Gotham Center for New York City History, the Bowery Poetry Club and others. Members of the Coalition include arts organizations, schools, workers’ rights groups, labor unions, human rights and women&#x27;s rights groups, ethnic organizations, historical preservation societies, activists, and scholars, as well as families of the victims and survivors.

The Coalition grew out of a public art project called Chalk, created by New York City filmmaker Ruth Sergel. Every year beginning in 2004, Sergel and volunteer artists went across New York City on the anniversary of the fire to inscribe in chalk the names, ages, and causes of death of the victims in front of their former homes, often including drawings of flowers, tombstones, or a triangle.

===Centennial===
From July 2009 to the weeks leading up to the 100th anniversary, the Coalition served as a clearinghouse to organize some 200 activities as varied as academic conferences, films, theater performances, art shows, concerts, readings, awareness campaigns, walking tours, and parades that were held in and around New York City and in other cities across the nation, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Boston, and Washington, D.C.
The ceremony, which was held in front of the building where the fire took place, was preceded by a march through Greenwich Village by thousands of people, some carrying shirtwaists—women&#x27;s blouses—on poles, with sashes commemorating the names of those who died in the fire. Speakers included the United States Secretary of Labor, Hilda L. Solis, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the actor Danny Glover, and Suzanne Pred Bass, the grandniece of Rosie Weiner, a young woman killed in the blaze. Most of the speakers that day called for the strengthening of workers’ rights and organized labor.

At 4:45 pm EST, the moment the first fire alarm was sounded in 1911, hundreds of bells rang out in cities and towns across the nation. For this commemorative act, the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition organized hundreds of churches, schools, fire houses, and private individuals in the New York City region and across the nation. On its website, the Coalition maintains a national map denoting each of the bells that rang that afternoon.

===Memorial in Manhattan===

The Coalition launched a successful effort to create a permanent public art memorial for the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire at the site of the 1911 fire in lower Manhattan.

In 2011, the Coalition established that the goals of the permanent memorial would be
* to honor the memory of those who died from the fire;
* to affirm the dignity of all workers;
* to value women&#x27;s work;
* to remember the movement for worker safety and social justice stirred by this tragedy; and
* to inspire future generations of activists.

In 2012, the Coalition signed an agreement with NYU that granted the organization permission to install a memorial on the Brown Building and, in consultation with the Landmarks Preservation Commission, indicated what elements of the building could be incorporated into the design. Architectural designer Ernesto Martinez directed an international competition for the design. A jury of representatives from fashion, public art, design, architecture, and labor history reviewed 170 entries from more than 30 countries and selected a spare yet powerful design by Richard Joon Yoo and Uri Wegman. On December 22, 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that $1.5 million from state economic development funds would be earmarked to build the Triangle Fire Memorial.

The memorial includes a steel ribbon descending from the building, before splitting into two horizontal ribbons, twelve feet above street level, on the corner of the building. The ribbons are meant to evoke mourning ribbons, which were traditionally draped on building facades by communities in mourning. The horizontal ribbons list the names and ages of all 146 victims, with the letters and numbers formed as holes in the steel. For married women, both their birth names and married names are included, in part to highlight the family connections between victims.

Under the ribbon is a reflective panel, allowing visitors to see the sky through the letters and numbers on the ribbon. The reflective panel also contains quotes from eyewitnesses about the event, in English, Italian, and Yiddish, reflecting the backgrounds of the victims. Another panel includes a description of the event and its impact, also written in English, Italian, and Yiddish.

The memorial was officially unveiled on October 11, 2023, more than a century after the fire occurred.

An additional vertical steel ribbon was installed in June 2024; it extends up the side of the building, dividing into two at the third floor, and eventually reaching the ninth floor, where many of the workers were trapped and from which many jumped.

== Mt. Zion Cemetery Memorial ==
A memorial &quot;of the Ladies Waist and Dress Makers Union Local No 25&quot; was erected in Mt. Zion Cemetery in Maspeth, Queens (40°44&#x27;2&quot; N 73°54&#x27;11&quot; W). It is a series of stone columns holding a large cross beam. Much of the writing is no longer legible due to erosion.

== Plaques ==
Three plaques on the southeast corner of the Brown Building commemorate the women and men who lost their lives in the fire.

<text>Thurman Lee Munson (June 7, 1947 – August 2, 1979) was an American professional baseball catcher who played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees, from 1969 until his death in 1979. A seven-time All-Star, Munson had a career batting average of .292 with 113 home runs and 701 runs batted in (RBIs). Known for his outstanding fielding, he won the Gold Glove Award in three consecutive years (1973–75).

Born in Akron, Ohio, Munson was selected as the fourth pick of the 1968 MLB draft and was named as the catcher on the 1968 College Baseball All-American Team. Munson hit over .300 in his two seasons in the minor leagues, establishing himself as a top prospect. He became the Yankees&#x27; starting catcher late in the 1969 season, and after his first complete season in 1970, in which he batted .302, he was voted American League (AL) Rookie of the Year. Considered the &quot;heart and soul&quot; of the Yankees, Munson was named captain of the Yankees in 1976, the team&#x27;s first since Lou Gehrig. That same year, he won the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award.

As captain, Munson helped lead the Yankees to three consecutive World Series appearances from 1976 to 1978, winning championships in the latter two years. He is the first player in baseball history to be named a College Baseball All-American and then in MLB win a Rookie of the Year Award, MVP Award, Gold Glove Award, and World Series championship. He is also the only catcher in MLB postseason history to record at least a .300+ batting average (.357), 20 RBIs (22), and 20 defensive caught stealings (24).

On August 2, 1979, Munson died in a crash while practicing landings in his aircraft at The Yankees honored him by immediately retiring his and dedicating a plaque to him in Monument Park.

==Early life==
Thurman Lee Munson was born on June 7, 1947, in Akron, Ohio, to Darrell Vernon Munson and Ruth Myrna Smylie, and he was the youngest of four children. His father was a World War II veteran who became a truck driver while his mother was a homemaker. When he turned eight, the Munson family moved to nearby Canton. He was taught how to play baseball by his older brother Duane, and usually played baseball with kids Duane&#x27;s age, who were four years older. His brother left to join the United States Air Force while Thurman was a freshman in high school.

Munson attended Lehman High School, where he was captain of the football, basketball, and baseball teams and was all-city and -state in all three sports. He played halfback in football, guard in basketball, and mostly shortstop in baseball. Munson switched to catcher in his senior year in order to handle the pitching prowess of his teammate, Jerome Pruett (a fifth-round draft pick of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1965 who never reached the majors).

==College career==
Munson attracted scholarship offers from various colleges, and opted to attend nearby Kent State University on scholarship, where he was a teammate of pitcher and broadcaster Steve Stone.

In the summer of 1967, Munson joined the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he led the Chatham A&#x27;s to their first league title with a prodigious .420 batting average. In recognition of this achievement and his subsequent professional achievements, the &quot;Thurman Munson Batting Award&quot; is given each season to the league&#x27;s In 2000, Munson was named a member of the inaugural class of the Cape Cod Baseball League Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Munson was selected by the Yankees with the fourth overall pick in the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. In his only full minor league season, he batted .301 with six home runs and 37 runs batted in (RBIs) for the Binghamton Triplets in their final season (), and made his first appearance in Yankee Stadium in August 1968, when the Triplets came to play an exhibition game against the Yankees. He was batting .363 for the Syracuse Chiefs in when he earned a promotion to the New York Yankees.

===New York Yankees (1969–1979)===
Munson made his major league debut on August 8, 1969, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Oakland Athletics. Munson went two for three with a walk, one RBI and two runs scored. Two days later, his first major league home run was the second of three consecutive home runs hit by the Yankees off Lew Krausse Jr. in a 5-1 Yankee victory over the A&#x27;s. For the season, Munson batted .256 with one home run and nine RBIs. He made 97 plate appearances, but drew ten walks and had one sacrifice fly, which gave him 86 official at bats, and allowed him to go into the season still technically a rookie.

The Yankees used the pair of Jake Gibbs and Frank Fernández at catcher for most of 1969. During the off season, the Yankees dealt Fernández to the A&#x27;s. Munson responded by batting .302 with seven home runs and 57 RBIs, and making 80 assists en route to receiving the 1970 American League Rookie of the Year award.

===1971–1974===
Munson received his first of seven All-Star nods in , catching the last two innings without an at-bat. An outstanding fielder, Munson committed only one error all season. It occurred on June 18 against the Baltimore Orioles when opposing catcher Andy Etchebarren knocked Munson unconscious on a play at the plate, dislodging the ball. He also only allowed nine passed balls all season and caught 36 of a potential 59 base stealers for a 61% caught stealing percentage.

Munson was known for his longstanding feud with Boston Red Sox counterpart Carlton Fisk. He would always be irritated at comments praising Boston&#x27;s catcher. One particular incident that typified their feud, and the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry in general, occurred on August 1, at Fenway Park. With the score tied at 2–2 in the top of the ninth and runners on first and third, Munson attempted to score from third on Gene Michael&#x27;s missed bunt attempt.

As Red Sox pitcher John Curtis let his first pitch go, Munson broke for the plate. Michael tried to bunt, and missed. With Munson coming, Fisk elbowed the Yankee shortstop out of the way and braced for Munson, who barreled into Fisk. Fisk held onto the ball, but Munson remained tangled with Fisk as Felipe Alou, who was on first, attempted to advance. The confrontation at the plate triggered a ten-minute bench-clearing brawl in which both catchers were ejected. &quot;The Fisk-Munson rivalry was at the core of the Yankees-Red Sox tension of that era,&quot; wrote sportswriter Moss Klein.

Munson made his second All-Star team and won his first of three straight Gold Glove Awards in 1973. He also emerged as more of a slugger for the Yankees, batting .300 for the first time since 1970, and hitting a career high 20 home runs. In , Munson was elected to start his first of three consecutive All-Star games, going one for three with a walk and a run scored.

===1975–1976===
On June 24, 1975, during a game against the Baltimore Orioles, Munson had an altercation with Mike Torrez. Torrez hit Munson with a pitch in the first inning, gave up a single to him in the fourth, and threw a pitch up by his head in the sixth. When Munson came to bat in the eighth, umpire Nick Bremigan warned Torrez not to throw any more brushback pitches; this time, Torrez blew kisses to Munson. The benches cleared, but no punches were thrown; however, after Munson grounded out to end the at-bat, he charged the pitcher&#x27;s mound. Munson batted a career high .318 in , which was third in the league behind Rod Carew and Fred Lynn. For the start of the season, Munson was named the first Yankees team captain since Lou Gehrig retired in . He responded by batting .302 with 17 home runs and 105 RBIs to receive the American League MVP Award and lead the Yankees to their first World Series appearance since . He batted .435 with three RBIs and three runs scored in the American League Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals, and batted .529 with two RBIs and two runs scored in the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Already down three games to none, Munson went four for four in the final game of the Series at Yankee Stadium, but New York was swept by the &quot;Big Red Machine.&quot; Combined with the hits he got in his final two at bats in game three, his six consecutive hits tied a World Series record set by Goose Goslin of the Washington Senators in .

Reds catcher Johnny Bench was named the World Series MVP in 1976. A fairly obvious comparison of opposing backstops was made to Reds manager Sparky Anderson during the post-World Series press conference, to which Anderson responded, &quot;Munson is an outstanding ballplayer and he would hit .300 in the National League, but you don&#x27;t ever compare anybody to Johnny Bench. Don&#x27;t never embarrass nobody by comparing them to Johnny Bench.&quot; Visibly upset by these comments, which he heard as he entered the room, Munson &quot;ripped into Anderson,&quot; according to sportswriter Moss Klein.

===1977–1979===
Over the 1976 offseason, Munson encouraged Steinbrenner to sign free agent slugger Reggie Jackson. &quot;Go out and get the big man,&quot; Munson said. &quot;He can carry a team like nobody else.&quot; The two struggled to get along, however, especially after Jackson did an interview with &quot;Sport&quot; magazine in late May. In the interview, Jackson claimed that he was &quot;the straw who stirs the drink&quot; and also stated &quot;Munson thinks he can be the straw that stirs the drink, but he can only stir it bad.&quot; When Jackson sent backup catcher Fran Healy to apologize for those remarks, insisting he was misquoted, Munson responded, &quot;For four bleeping pages?!&quot; Ill feelings persisted for much of the year between the two men, but they eventually came to respect one another late in the year, recognizing each other&#x27;s talent and importance to the team.

Munson batted .308 with 100 RBIs in 1977, giving him three consecutive seasons batting .300 or better with 100 or more RBIs each year. He was the first catcher to accomplish the feat in three consecutive years since Yankee Hall of Famer Bill Dickey&#x27;s four straight seasons from -1939, matched only by Mike Piazza since (–). The Yankees repeated as American League Champions, and faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. Munson batted .320 with a home run and three RBIs in the Yankees four games to two victory over the Dodgers. The Dodgers had stolen 114 bases during the regular season, yet Munson caught four of six potential base stealers in the first four games of the series to keep the speedy Dodgers grounded in the final two.

In 1978, the Yankees and Royals faced each other for the third consecutive time in the ALCS. Tied at a game apiece, and trailing in the bottom of the eighth inning of game three, Munson hit the longest home run of his career, a shot off Doug Bird over Yankee Stadium&#x27;s Monument Park in left-center field, to give the Yankees a They won the pennant the next day, and went on to beat the Dodgers again in the World Series in six games, winning the final four. Munson batted .320 (8-for-25) with seven RBIs in this Series and also caught Ron Cey&#x27;s foul pop-up for the final out.

Munson&#x27;s World Series championships in 1977 and 1978 made him only the second catcher in baseball history, after Johnny Bench, to win a Rookie of the Year Award, an MVP Award, a Gold Glove Award, and a World Series title during his career. Subsequently, Buster Posey became the third catcher to win all four awards. Munson and Posey, both named as college baseball All-Americans, are the only two catchers named to an All-American team who also own a ROY, MVP, GG, and World Series title.

The Yankees had lost three in a row, and were in fourth place, eleven games behind the Baltimore Orioles in the American League East heading into the All-Star break in 1979. Despite a .288 average, the wear-and-tear of catching was beginning to take its toll on Munson, and he was overlooked for the American League All-Star team. Frequently homesick, he had been asking for a trade to the Cleveland Indians since 1977 in order to be closer to his family in Canton. Munson was also considering retiring at the end of the season. At the end of July, the Yankees were still in fourth place at , fourteen games behind 

==Death==

In August 1979, Munson had been flying airplanes for over a year and purchased a Cessna Citation I/SP jet with a Yankee blue interior so he could fly home to his family in Canton on off-days. It was his fourth airplane in less than a year and a half. His flight instructor Dave Hall spoke well of his ability: &quot;From the onset to completion of training Mr. Munson displayed well above average skills and judgment as a pilot.&quot; However, in a 2022 tribute piece for his &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; podcast, sports commentator Keith Olbermann recalled that four months before Munson&#x27;s death, he was told that Yankee executives were terrified Munson was &quot;not as good a pilot as he thinks he is&quot; and that they were attempting to get owner George Steinbrenner to trade him to Cleveland to get him to stop flying, afraid that he might &quot;wind up killing himself.&quot;

On the afternoon of August 2, 1979, Munson was practicing takeoffs and landings at the Akron-Canton Regional Airport with Hall and friend Jerry Anderson, with whom he had formed a real estate partnership. Shortly after 3:40p.m. EDT, Munson had received clearance for takeoff and three touch-and-go landings on Runway 23, which were completed.

While on approach for the fourth and final landing on a different runway (19), Munson did not extend the flaps and allowed the aircraft to sink too low before increasing engine power, causing the jet to clip a tree and fall short of the runway. The plane then hit a tree stump and burst into flames, on Greensburg Road, short of runway 19.

Hall and Anderson both survived the accident. Hall received burns on his arms and hands, and Anderson received burns on his face, arm and neck. Munson, however, was in a more precarious position. Unable to move due to what was originally thought to be the wrecked fuselage of the plane pinning him against his seat, Munson was trapped and Hall and Anderson were unable to free him in the only attempt they were able to make before flames engulfed the cockpit. Munson died of asphyxiation due to the inhalation of superheated air and toxic substances. Later it was revealed that Munson had suffered a cervical fracture on impact which resulted in paralysis, rendering him unable to move.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the crash stated that the probable cause was &quot;the pilot&#x27;s failure to recognize the need for, and to take action to maintain, sufficient airspeed to prevent a stall into the ground during an attempted landing. The pilot also failed to recognize the need for timely and sufficient power application to prevent the stall during an approach conducted inadvertently without flaps extended. Contributing to the pilot&#x27;s inability to recognize the problem and to take proper action was his failure to use the appropriate checklist and his nonstandard pattern procedures which resulted in an abnormal approach profile.&quot; Munson was not wearing the available shoulder harness restraint, only a lap belt, which contributed to the severity of his injuries. Anderson credited Munson for remaining at the controls with saving his life. &quot;Thurman flew that airplane to the last nanosecond. He kept it under control and brought us down. He never panicked. He saved our lives.&quot;

On August 1, , the day before the first anniversary of the accident, the Yankees filed a $4.5-million lawsuit against Cessna Aircraft Co. and Flight Safety International, Inc. (the company who was training Munson to fly), with team spokesman John J. McCarty saying &quot;we asked for $4.5 million because that is what Munson would be worth if the Yankees traded him.&quot; That lawsuit was dismissed before it went to trial. Munson&#x27;s widow, Diana, also filed a $42.2 million wrongful death lawsuit against the two companies. Cessna offered Munson a special deal on flying lessons if he would take them from FlightSafety International. Rather than requiring Munson to take a two-week safety class in Kansas, FlightSafety assigned a &quot;traveling instructor&quot; to go on the road with him, and train him between ballgames. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.

==Legacy==

The day after his death, before the start of the Yankees&#x27; four-game set with the Baltimore Orioles in the Bronx, the team paid tribute to their deceased captain in a pre-game ceremony in which the starters stood at their defensive positions, save for the catcher&#x27;s box, which remained empty. Following a prayer by Cardinal Terence Cooke, a moment of silence and &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; by Robert Merrill, the fans (announced attendance 51,151) burst into an eight-minute standing ovation. Catcher Jerry Narron, who replaced Munson behind the plate that night, remained in the dugout and did not enter the field until stadium announcer Bob Sheppard said, &quot;And now it is time to play ball. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your co-operation.&quot;
On August 6, the entire Yankee team attended Munson&#x27;s funeral in Canton. Teammates Lou Piniella and Bobby Murcer, who were Munson&#x27;s best friends, gave eulogies at the gathering of 700 at the Canton Memorial Civic Center. That night, before a national viewing audience on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot;, the Yankees beat the Orioles 5–4 in New York, with Murcer driving in all five runs with a three-run home run in the seventh inning and a two-run single in the bottom of the ninth.

Piniella said Munson was &quot;the greatest competitor I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Tommy John said, &quot;He was the main reason I came to New York. He was an excellent catcher who called an outstanding game.&quot; John also praised him for his leadership, writing that while Jackson led the team when it came to hitting and talking with the press, &quot;in the locker room we looked to Munson.&quot;

Yankee owner George Steinbrenner retired Munson&#x27;s number 15 immediately upon his catcher&#x27;s death. On September 20, , a plaque dedicated to Munson&#x27;s memory was placed in Monument Park. The plaque bears excerpts from an inscription composed by Steinbrenner and flashed on the stadium scoreboard the day after his death:

The locker that Munson used, along with a bronzed set of his catching equipment, was donated to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Despite a packed clubhouse, Munson&#x27;s final locker position was never reassigned. The locker next to Yankee team captain Derek Jeter&#x27;s, with Munson&#x27;s number 15 on it, remained unused as a tribute to the Yankees&#x27; lost catcher in the original Yankee Stadium until the Stadium closed in 2008. Munson&#x27;s locker was moved in one piece to the New Yankee Stadium. It is located in the New York Yankees Museum. Visitors can view the Yankees Museum on game days from when the gates open to the end of the eighth inning and during Yankee Stadium tours. Munson&#x27;s number 15 is also displayed on the center-field wall at Thurman Munson Stadium, a minor-league ballpark in Canton.

A modest, one-block street at Concourse Village East and 156th Street in The Bronx was named Thurman Munson Way in 1979. Two school buildings, which house several schools including Henry Lou Gehrig Junior High School, have since been built on the street.

The area in Connecticut between Boston and New York City, has been referred to as the &quot;Munson–Nixon line&quot;, a play on the Mason–Dixon line, after Munson and former Red Sox player Trot Nixon. Steve Rushin, who coined the term in a 2003 Sports Illustrated article, has pinpointed the line as running north of New Haven, south of Hartford, and along the width of central Connecticut.

Actor Erik Jensen portrayed Munson in the 2007 ESPN produced mini-series &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;.

Munson was included on the 2020 Modern Era Hall of Fame Ballot.

==Personal life==
In September 1968, Munson married Diana Dominick at St. John&#x27;s Church in Canton. The couple had been childhood sweethearts; Diana was already signing her name &quot;Mrs. Thurman Munson&quot; back in sixth grade. They had three children: daughter Tracy, daughter Kelly and son Michael. At Game 3 of the 1997 World Series in Cleveland, Diana threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Michael also played baseball professionally, spending three years in the Yankees&#x27; organization and one year in Double-A for the Giants. &quot;It felt like I was competing against a ghost, because I didn&#x27;t know if he would&#x27;ve been proud of what I&#x27;d done,&quot; Michael said of his career. &quot;Nothing people said affected me, and the comparisons didn&#x27;t affect me, because the pressure I put on myself was more than any pressure other people put on me.&quot;

Munson also enjoyed handball, which he often played at the Canton YMCA. Frogs legs were one of his favorite foods, and he also liked chocolate. He also smoked cigars.

Munson gave Yankee teammate Reggie Jackson his famous nickname &quot;Mr. October&quot;.

<text>The A470 (also named the Cardiff to Glan Conwy Trunk Road) is a trunk road in Wales. It is the country&#x27;s longest road at and links the capital Cardiff on the south coast to Llandudno on the north coast. While previously one had to navigate the narrow roads of Llanidloes and Dolgellau, both these market towns are now bypassed due to extensive road modernisation. The from Cardiff Bay to Merthyr Tydfil are mainly dual carriageway, but most of the route from north of Merthyr to Llandudno is single carriageway.

==Route==
===National parks===
The road travels through two of the national parks of Wales: the Brecon Beacons, and Snowdonia National Park starting just south of Dinas Mawddwy.

===Cardiff Bay – Merthyr Tydfil===
The southernmost point of the route is in Cardiff Bay, outside the Wales Millennium Centre. It runs up Lloyd George Avenue (this was previously Collingdon Road, and the A470 previously ran along the parallel Bute Street), and continues along St. Mary Street in central Cardiff. The road then becomes North Road, and after a tidal flow system running to Maindy and then goes over the flyover at the Gabalfa interchange of the A48 and the A469. It becomes an urban dual-carriageway along Manor Way, with a speed limit and with many traffic-signalled crossings. It passes without interruption under the M4 at the giant Coryton roundabout. For the next it is a modern high-speed dual carriageway by-passing Tongwynlais and Castell Coch, Taff&#x27;s Well, to Pontypridd. Heading north to Abercynon, the road now follows the route of the Taff Vale Railways Llancaiach Branch to Quakers Yard roundabout, where it is joined by the A4059 from Abercynon, Aberdare and Hirwaun; the A472 from Ystrad Mynach and Pontypool finally the A4054 from Quakers Yard, and Merthyr Tydfil.

From Quakers Yard roundabout (locally known as &quot;Fiddlers Elbow&quot;), of dual carriageway takes the road to the Pentrebach roundabout where the A4060 links, and then to the Merthyr Tydfil roundabout where the road meets the A465 and the dual carriageway ends. A twisting section alongside the Taf Fawr reservoirs of Llwyn-on, Cantref and Beacons takes the road to its highest point at Storey Arms on the pass over the Brecon Beacons before a long descent to Brecon.

===Merthyr Tydfil – Builth Wells===

The remainder of the route north of Brecon consists of older routes now renamed &quot;A470&quot;. This artificiality is apparent as a driver following the entire route north to south must diverge from the main line of respective stretches of road no fewer than five times. A short three lane stretch heads north east before a sharp left turn is required to stay on the road. From this point on the road becomes narrow and twisting and overtaking is problematic except at a few straight sections. Another sharp left turn at a stop sign in Llyswen takes the road alongside the River Wye into Builth Wells.

===Builth Wells – Mallwyd===

The road continues to follow the Wye to the busy crossroads where it meets the A44 in the centre of Rhayader. On reaching Llangurig, a right turn outside the village takes the road past Llanidloes and through Llandinam, the birthplace of David Davies and now the headquarters of Girl Guides Wales. Another anomalous left turn at a level crossing sets the path for Caersws, Carno and Llanbrynmair. Just beyond the village of Talerddig the road descends and crosses under the Shrewsbury–Aberystwyth railway line. The long descent towards Commins Coch is a relatively new stretch of road that replaced a set of road-works that had traffic light controlled single lane working for over 10 years because of unstable ground conditions. The river bridge at Commins Coch is so narrow and set at such an angle that only one vehicle at a time can pass. At Cemmaes Road the road joins the A487 at a roundabout. A right turn at the roundabout takes the road on to Mallwyd where the A458 joins at yet another roundabout.

===Mallwyd – Llandudno===
The country becomes more forested and the road climbs up through Dinas Mawddwy and then steeply up the eastern foot-hills of Cadair Idris before dropping down to the Dolgellau by-pass. More sharp twists and turns in the forestry and through the village of Ganllwyd brings the road up onto the high plateau of the Cambrian dome where the road follows the ancient track of Sarn Helen Roman road passing the redundant nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd. A right turn beyond the power station takes the road on to Ffestiniog and Blaenau Ffestiniog before heading over the Crimea Pass to Dolwyddelan. A sharp left turn interrupts the A470 as it becomes the A5 for a short distance towards Betws-y-Coed before turning right again back onto the A470 just before Waterloo Bridge. Passing down the valley of the River Conwy the road passes through Llanrwst, Tal-y-Cafn and Glan Conwy, at which point there is a dual roundabout that intersects with the A55 North Wales Expressway before descending into Llandudno. The northernmost point of the route is in Llandudno itself at the sea front, where it meets the North Shore Parade, the A547.

== History ==
===Modern route===
The modern route of the A470 arose from a campaign in the 1970s by the &quot;Western Mail&quot; for a single route connecting North and South Wales, in the lead up to the 1979 Welsh devolution referendum. It was successful, and in 1978, the Welsh Office discussed a potential course of the road roughly through the centre of the country, which was implemented the following year.

===Original route===
The route from Cardiff to Brecon was the original A470. It originally ran into Brecon town centre and joined the A40 road. The old A470 between the by-pass and the town, along Newgate Street, is now the B4601. A4062 was the number for the section from the junction of the A40 and the B4601 – the Brecon (eastern) bypass to B4602 section. The B4601 was originally the A40 which ran through the town of Brecon. Similarly, the B4602 was originally the westernmost part of the A438.

===Original road numbers===
====Brecon – Llangurig====
The A438 was the original number for the road from the junction with B4602 to the sharp left turn where A470 turns north in the vicinity of Llanfilo. The A438 continues on from there to Hereford and Tewkesbury. From north of Llanfilo to Llyswen was the A4073. A479 originally linked the A40 west of Crickhowell to the A44 road at Rhayader. The A479 now runs only from Crickhowell to Llyswen. The stretch from Rhayader to Llangurig was the A44. Officially, this is now part of the A470, but some local signage shows A44/A470.

====Llangurig – Mallwyd====
From Llangurig to Moat Lane (east of Caersws), it was once part of the A492, which originally ran from Llangurig to Newtown. The section Moat Lane to Newtown has since been renumbered A489, and from Moat Lane to Glantwymyn the A470 replaced the A489 which ran all the way from Machynlleth to the A49 road north of Craven Arms in south Shropshire. Now the A489 designation applies to two roads separated by of the A470. The stretch between Glantwymyn to Mallwyd was called the A4084.

====Dolgellau====
Originally starting at the Cross Foxes near Dolgellau the A458 now runs only from Mallwyd to Shrewsbury. It now starts at Mallwyd with the Mallwyd to Cross Foxes section being the A470. Cross Foxes to near Gellilydan (in the Meirionydd part of Gwynedd south of Ffestiniog) brings us to a complicated series of route renumbering. This stretch was originally the A487 which ran through Dolgellau town centre. The modern A470 bypasses the town using the line of the old Ruabon – Morfa Mawddach railway.

====Gellilydan – Llandudno====
Gellilydan via Llan Ffestiniog to Blaenau Ffestiniog (Congl-y-Wal) was not originally allocated a number. The section from Blaenau Ffestiniog to Betws-y-Coed was the B4407, and from there to Llandudno was the A544. By 1946, the A496 had become extended to Llandudno.

The section of road from Glan Conwy corner to Llandudno is a new well aligned direct route to Llandudno. The old A496 has been renumbered A547 between Glan Conwy and Llandudno Junction and A546 between Llandudno Junction and Llandudno. The A496 now numbers only the Dolgellau – Blaenau Ffestiniog coast road.

== Cultural references ==
In 2014, Cerys Matthews presented a documentary on the A470 on BBC Radio 4, journeying from the north of the country to Cardiff Bay. The programme described the road as &quot;the M1 motorway of Wales&quot;, despite most of the road being rural single-carriageway, with Matthews stopping off at places like Llanrwst and Rhayader.

In March 2022, Arachne Press published &quot;A470: Poems for the Road / Cerddi’r Ffordd&quot;, a bilingual English and Welsh book of poems about the A470, edited by Siân Northey and Ness Owen. Published on St. David&#x27;s Day, by June of that year it had its second reprint.

Other references in Welsh popular culture include:

<text>The year 1916 involved a number of significant events in science and technology, some of which are listed below.

==Astronomy==
* Barnard&#x27;s Star is discovered by Edward Emerson Barnard.
* Harlow Shapley finds that the spectrum of S Sagittae and other Cepheid variables varies with brightness, recording it as spectral type F0 leading to maximum, F4 at maximum, and G3 just before minimum brightness.

==Chemistry==
* Gilbert N. Lewis and Irving Langmuir formulate an electron shell model of chemical bonding.
* The Born–Haber cycle, an approach to analyze reaction energies, is developed by German scientists Max Born and Fritz Haber.
* Sydney Chapman and David Enskog systematically develop a kinetic theory of gases.
* Jan Czochralski invents a method for growing single crystals of metals.

==Mathematics==
* Ludwig Bieberbach presents the Bieberbach conjecture.
* Wacław Sierpiński gives the first example of an absolutely normal number and describes the Sierpinski carpet.

* 1 January – The British Royal Army Medical Corps carries out the first successful blood transfusion using blood that had been stored and cooled.
* 16 October – Margaret Sanger opens a family planning and birth control clinic in Brownsville, Brooklyn, the first of its kind in the United States. Nine days later, she is arrested for breaking a New York state law prohibiting distribution of contraceptives. This same year, she publishes &quot;What Every Girl Should Know&quot;, providing information about such topics as menstruation and sexuality in adolescents.
* Georges Guillain, Jean Alexandre Barré and André Strohl diagnose two soldiers with Guillain–Barré syndrome of the peripheral nervous system and describe the key diagnostic abnormality of increased spinal fluid protein production, but normal cell count.
* Eugen Bleuler publishes his &quot;Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie&quot;, including a definition of complexes arising from diffuse brain damage, known as &quot;Bleuler&#x27;s psycho syndrome&quot;.
* Medication Suramin against African sleeping sickness and river blindness is first made by German company Bayer AG.

==Physics==
* Albert Einstein publishes &quot;Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie&quot; on general relativity in &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot; 49 and shows that the field equations of general relativity admit wavelike solutions. This will be demonstrated in 2016.
* Karl Schwarzschild solves the Einstein vacuum field equations for uncharged spherically symmetric non-rotating systems and calculates Schwarzschild radius.

==Psychology==
* Lewis M. Terman of Stanford University develops the first of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales for intelligence testing.

==Technology==
* February – &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; steel helmet first issued to German soldiers.
* 18 April – Capt. Peter Nissen completes the prototype Nissen hut.
* 11 September – The almost-completed Quebec Bridge collapses for the second time.

<text>The districts of England (officially, local authority districts, abbreviated LADs) are a level of subnational division of England used for the purposes of local government. As the structure of local government in England is not uniform, there are currently four principal types of district-level subdivision. There are a total of districts made up of 36 metropolitan boroughs, 32 London boroughs, 164 two-tier non-metropolitan districts and 62 unitary authorities, as well as the City of London and the Isles of Scilly which are also districts but do not correspond to any of these other categories. Some districts are styled as cities, boroughs or royal boroughs; these are purely honorific titles and do not alter the status of the district or the powers of their councils. All boroughs and cities (and a few districts) are led by a mayor who in most cases is a ceremonial figure elected by the district council, but—after local government reform—is occasionally a directly elected mayor who makes most of the policy decisions instead of the council.

==History==

Before the establishment of districts in the 1890s, the basic unit of local government in England was the parish, overseen by the parish church vestry committee. Vestries dealt with the administration of both and secular governmental matters. Parishes were the successors of the manorial system and historically had been grouped into hundreds, which had exercised some supervising administrative function. However, these powers ebbed away as more and more civic and judicial powers were centred on county towns. From 1834 these parishes were grouped into Poor Law Unions, creating areas for administration of the Poor Law. These areas were later used for census registration and as the basis for sanitary provision. In 1894, based on these earlier subdivisions, the Local Government Act 1894 created urban districts and rural districts as sub-divisions of administrative counties, which had been created in 1889. At the same time, parish-level local government administration was transferred to civil parishes. Another reform in 1900 created 28 metropolitan boroughs as sub-divisions of the County of London.

The setting-down of the current structure of districts in England began in 1965, when Greater London and its 32 London boroughs were created. They are the oldest type of district still in use. In 1974, metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan counties (also known as &quot;shire counties&quot;) were created across the rest of England and were split into metropolitan districts and non-metropolitan districts.

The status of the London boroughs and metropolitan districts changed in 1986, when they absorbed the functions and some of the powers of the metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council, which were abolished. Since 2000, powers are again shared (on a different basis) with the Greater London Authority.

During the 1990s a further kind of district was created, the unitary authority, which combined the functions and status of county and district.

==Metropolitan boroughs==

Metropolitan boroughs are a subdivision of a metropolitan county. These are similar to unitary authorities, as the metropolitan county councils were abolished in 1986. Most of the powers of the county councils were devolved to the districts but some services are run by joint boards and organisations. The districts typically have populations of 174,000 to 1.1 million.

==Non-metropolitan districts==

Non-metropolitan districts are second-tier authorities, which share power with county councils. They are subdivisions of shire counties and the most common type of district. These districts typically have populations of 25,000 to 200,000.

In this two-tier system, county councils are responsible for some local services, such as education, social services, and roads, while district councils run other services, such as waste collection, local planning, and council housing.

The number of two-tier non-metropolitan districts (also known as shire districts) has varied over time. Initially, there were 296; after the creation of single-tier unitary authorities in the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s, their numbers were reduced to 164 by 2023.

===Unitary authority areas===

These single-tier non-metropolitan districts are responsible for running all local services in their areas, combining county and district functions. They were first created in the mid-1990s, and often cover large towns and cities as this is deemed more efficient than a two-tier structure. In addition, some of the smaller counties such as Rutland, Herefordshire and the Isle of Wight are unitary authorities. There are a total of 62 unitary authorities, the latest ones introduced in 2023.

Unitary authority areas are a type of non-metropolitan district; most are established as individual counties containing a single district, with a district council but no county council. Cornwall, Durham, the Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire were established as counties with a single district, but have non-metropolitan county councils with no district council. In practice, these function in the same way as other unitary authorities. Berkshire is unusual, being the only non-metropolitan county, with no county council, that has more than one unitary authority district within it, each of which is not a county.

===Districts with their ceremonial or historic county in their names===
==London boroughs==

The 32 London boroughs are sub-divisions of Greater London. They were established in 1965. Between 1965 and 1986 a two-tier structure of government existed in Greater London and the boroughs shared power with the Greater London Council (GLC). When the GLC was abolished in 1986 they gained similar status to the unitary authorities. In 2000 the Greater London Authority was established and a two-tier structure was restored, albeit with a change to the balance of powers and responsibilities.

Each London borough is responsible for many of the services within their area, such as schools, waste management, planning applications, social services, libraries and others.

<text>The Seeds are an American psychedelic garage rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965, best known for their highest-charting single &quot;Pushin&#x27; Too Hard&quot;. The band&#x27;s classic line-up featured frontman Sky Saxon, guitarist Jan Savage (born Buck Jan Reeder), keyboardist Daryl Hooper and drummer Rick Andridge. In 1968, the band changed their name to &quot;Sky Saxon and the Seeds&quot;, with Savage and Andridge departing the band. They went on to release a handful of additional singles.

In 1989, the original lineup of the band reformed for a handful of live dates in the US.

In 2003, Saxon reformed the Seeds with original guitarist Jan Savage (who departed part way through a European tour the same year due to ill health). Releasing 2 further studio albums, the band continued to tour the US, UK and Europe up to Saxon&#x27;s death in 2009. 

In 2017, Hooper reformed the Seeds with a line-up of past and new members; they released a single in 2021 and continue to tour to this day.

==History==
===Formation===
The Seeds were formed in 1965 following the dissolution of the short lived band the Amoeba which featured frontman Sky Saxon and guitarist Jan Savage.

Saxon, who had relocated to Los Angeles from Salt Lake City and had already released material under several names including &quot;Little Richie Marsh&quot; and &quot;Sky Saxon &amp; the Soul Rockers&quot; put an ad in the LA Times for a keyboard player. Having already enlisted former bandmate Jan Savage as lead guitarist and Jeremy Levine as rhythm guitarist, Saxon reportedly contacted Daryl Hooper to recruit him as a keyboard player. After then asking Saxon whether he also needed a drummer, Hooper and Michigan school friend Rick Andridge met up with Saxon at a club and played that same night. They began rehearsing in the garage of Saxon&#x27;s home in Malibu, California. Original rhythm guitarist Jeremy Levine left early on for personal reasons.

The band secured regular gigs at the LA club Bido Lito&#x27;s and quickly gained a local reputation for high-energy live performances.

As a live act, the band was one of the first to utilize keyboard bass. Although Saxon was credited as playing bass on the studio albums and would mime playing bass on TV appearances, they usually employed session player Harvey Sharpe for studio work. On stage, keyboardist Daryl Hooper would perform the bass parts via a separate bass keyboard, in the same manner as Ray Manzarek later did with The Doors.

===Recordings and TV appearances===
The Seeds&#x27; first single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Seem to Make You Mine&quot;, was a regional hit in Southern California in 1965. The song was also played regularly on AM rock stations in northern California (and probably elsewhere), where it was well received by listeners, and eventually went on to become, and is considered today, a &#x27;60s cult classic song. The band had a national Top 40 hit, &quot;Pushin&#x27; Too Hard&quot;, in 1966 and performed the song on national television. Three subsequent singles, &quot;Mr. Farmer&quot; (also 1966), a re-release of &quot;Can&#x27;t Seem To Make You Mine&quot; (1967), and &quot;A Thousand Shadows&quot; (1967), achieved more modest success, although all were most popular in southern California. Musically uncomplicated with a flair for simple melodic hooks and dominated by Saxon&#x27;s unorthodox vocal delivery, their first two albums, &quot;The Seeds&quot; and &quot;A Web of Sound&quot;, are today considered classics of 1960s garage music.

A major turning point for the Seeds came in 1967. The band&#x27;s self-produced third album &quot;Future&quot; presented a grander psychedelic artistic statement and thrust the group forward as torchbearers during perhaps the most creative and experimental time in American pop culture and music history. The more expansive musical style with accompanying orchestration—presented with a gatefold sleeve featuring ornate flower-themed artwork by painter Sassin—was a departure from the rawer tone of the band&#x27;s previous hits but nevertheless received acclaim from fans and critics as a notable work of flower power psychedelia. It remains a genre curiosity piece today and is regarded as a pioneering effort in full-blown psychedelic rock. Iggy Pop, Smashing Pumpkins, Animal Collective and members of the Beach Boys have all sourced the band, mentioning this album and previous ones as genre classics.

The release of &quot;Future&quot; in mid 1967 generally marked the commercial peak of the Seeds’ career, coinciding with a major national hit, raucous concerts, numerous live TV performances, as well as prominent guest appearances on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot; and in the hippie/counterculture-themed cult film &quot;Psych-Out&quot;. The Seeds also recorded another album devoted specifically to the blues (with liner notes by Muddy Waters). &quot;A Full Spoon of Seedy Blues&quot;, bearing the artist moniker Sky Saxon Blues Band, was released in November 1967. Saxon later stated that the album &quot;was my idea to get off the record label. I thought that if we just came up out of nowhere and did a blues album that wasn’t going to sell, then they’d drop us. I never expected it to sell but it did OK. We never did those songs live except for a week of gigs at the Golden Bear in Huntingdon Beach&quot;.

In May 1968 the band released their final LP for GNP Crescendo Records, &quot;Raw &amp; Alive: The Seeds in Concert at Merlin&#x27;s Music Box&quot;, which revisited their more aggressive garage rock roots. However, the album and its accompanying single &quot;Satisfy You&quot; both failed to chart nationally. The band was renamed &quot;Sky Saxon and the Seeds&quot; in 1968, by which point Bob Norsoph (guitar) and Don Boomer (drums) had replaced Savage and Andridge, respectively. Saxon continued to use the name &quot;The Seeds&quot;, utilizing various backup musicians, at least through 1972. The last major-label records of new material by The Seeds—two non-charting singles on MGM records—were released in 1970.

===Dissolution and reformations===
After the dissolution of the Seeds, Sky Saxon joined the Yahowha religious group, inspired by their leader Father Yod. Although a member of the Source Family for several years, Saxon did not participate in any of the albums released by Yahowha 13 in the mid-1970s. He does appear on the &quot;Golden Sunrise&quot; album by Fire Water Air, which was a Yahowha 13 offshoot, and later recorded the &quot;Yod Ship Suite&quot; album in memory of the deceased Father Yod. In the 1970s, Saxon also released the solo LPs &quot;Lovers Cosmic Voyage&quot; (credited to Sunlight) and &quot;Live at the Orpheum&quot; credited to Sunlight Rainbow. In the 1980s, Saxon collaborated with several bands—including Redd Kross and The Chesterfield Kings—before reforming the original Seeds in 1989 to headline &quot;The Summer of Love Tour&quot;, along with Big Brother and the Holding Company, Arthur Lee and Love, The Music Machine, and The Strawberry Alarm Clock.

The Seeds remained dormant again until 2003, when Saxon reformed them with original guitarist Jan Savage and newcomers Rik Collins on bass, Mark Bellgraph on guitar, and Dave Klein on keyboards and Justin Polimeni on drums. This new version of the Seeds went through several incarnations, with Savage departing midway through their 2003 European tour due to his health. Saxon remained the only original member of the Seeds, which continued to tour Europe and the United States.

Saxon died on June 25, 2009, of heart and kidney failure. The Seeds&#x27; original drummer, Rick Andridge, died in 2011. Jan Savage died on August 5, 2020, aged 77.

In June 2017, a &quot;reunited version&quot; of the band (with founding member Daryl Hooper and drummer Don Boomer and adding Paul Kopf on lead vocals) gave their first performance after a viewing of the documentary at the Center for the Arts in Grass Valley, California. This version of the band continues to tour to this day with some lineup changes. In 2021, Hooper&#x27;s version of the band released a single, &quot;Butterfly Child / Vampire&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
The Seeds have been among the most frequently cited pre-punk influences by American punk musicians since the 1970s. Cover versions of various Seeds songs have been recorded by The Dwarves, Alex Chilton, Johnny Thunders, The Ramones, Yo La Tengo, Garbage, Murder City Devils, Spirits in the Sky, Paul Parker, Pere Ubu, The Makers, The Embarrassment, The Bangles, The Rubinoos, Strawberry Alarm Clock, and other artists. Some lyrics in Frank Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; satirically refer to &quot;Pushin&#x27; Too Hard&quot;: &quot;You&#x27;re plooking too hard, Plooking too hard on ME&quot;.

On July 24, 2009, members of The Smashing Pumpkins, members of The Strawberry Alarm Clock, Nels Cline and The Electric Prunes performed a tribute concert at the Echoplex in Los Angeles in memory of Sky Saxon.

A 2014 feature-length documentary film about the Seeds titled &quot;The Seeds: Pushin&#x27; Too Hard&quot; was directed by Neil Norman. The film draws on first-hand knowledge of the band, interviews, and concert footage.

In 1996 GNP Crescendo released &quot;Flower Punk&quot;, a box set of their first five albums, &quot;The Seeds&quot;, &quot;A Web of Sound&quot;, &quot;Future&quot;, &quot;A Full Spoon of Seedy Blues&quot; (as the Sky Saxon Blues Band), and &quot;Raw &amp; Alive: The Seeds in Concert at Merlin&#x27;s Music Box&quot;, plus several rarities, b-sides, and other cuts (nothing unreleased) as a three-disc collection.

<text>The Reagans is a 2003 American biographical drama television film about U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his family. It was directed by Robert Allan Ackerman and written by Jane Marchwood, Tom Rickman, and Elizabeth Egloff, based on the 1991 biography &quot;First Ladies Volume II&quot; by Carl Sferrazza Anthony. It stars James Brolin as Reagan and Judy Davis as First Lady Nancy Reagan. The supporting cast includes Željko Ivanek, Mary Beth Peil, Bill Smitrovich, Shad Hart, Zoie Palmer, Richard Fitzpatrick, Vlasta Vrána, Francis Xavier McCarthy, Frank Moore, Aidan Devine, and John Stamos.

The network CBS had planned to broadcast it as a 2-part miniseries in November 2003 during fall &quot;sweeps&quot;, but it was ultimately broadcast as a film on November 30 of that year on cable channel Showtime due to controversy over its portrayal of Reagan.

==Plot==
The film covers the period in time from 1949 when Reagan was still in Hollywood, through his governorship of California until his last day in office as President in 1989.

In 1968, Reagan loses the Republican nomination to Richard Nixon. At the end of his 8 years of service as the California governor in 1975, Reagan vies for the Republican party nomination in 1976. Then-President Gerald Ford wins the nomination.

Patti Davis, one of the daughters of Ronald Reagan, is portrayed as a drug addict.

After the assassination attempt on Reagan in 1981, American jets are shot down by Libya later that year.

==Controversy==
About a month before it was scheduled to air, portions of the script were leaked. As a result of these stories, the miniseries began to be widely criticized by conservatives as an unbalanced and inaccurate depiction of Reagan. CBS reportedly had ordered a love story about Ronald and Nancy Reagan with politics as a backdrop, but instead received what they later claimed was an overtly political film. Supporters of the film claimed that these criticisms were simply partisan bias, and were an attempt to censor a film because it did not always portray the former president in a positive light.

Conservatives began criticizing the miniseries before it was broadcast and claimed that it put words in Reagan&#x27;s mouth and condemned it as leftist historical revisionism. Much of the criticism was based upon early drafts of the script and featured scenes that were never shot or were cut from the final version. Eventually, after several weeks of outspoken criticism by conservatives, on November 4, 2003, CBS withdrew the miniseries from the broadcast schedule and announced that the program did &quot;not present a balanced portrayal of the Reagans.&quot; The network chose instead to broadcast the miniseries on the cable channel Showtime, which along with CBS was owned by Viacom. In a statement on its web site, CBS said:

CBS&#x27;s denial that it was yielding to the furor did not persuade its critics. The producers of the movie noted that, before the outcry, CBS had approved both the script for the miniseries and had seen dailies as they were shot, and the film had been approved by two sets of lawyers. Jeff Chester, head of the Center for Digital Democracy, a communications lobbying group, said that CBS had chosen not to offend Republicans at a time when the federal government was considering rules restricting ownership of local television stations. CBS executives &quot;made a business decision,&quot; he said. &quot;In doing so, they clearly caved in to the political pressure.&quot; Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader of the time, commented that the decision &quot;smells of intimidation to me.&quot;

Reagans&#x27; daughter Patti Davis criticized the portrayal of her parents. She accused the show&#x27;s producers of &quot;astounding carelessness and cruelty&quot; and said the script was &quot;quite simply, idiotic.&quot; She said that her father was caricatured as a &quot;demented evangelist&quot;, while her mother Nancy was made out to be &quot;a female Attila the Hun.&quot; &quot;To deliberately and calculatingly depict public people as shallow, intolerant, cold and inept, with no truths or facts to back up the portrayals, is nothing short of malevolent.&quot; &quot;And my father, obviously, cannot correct the lies told about him.&quot;

===A controversial line excised===
One of the most controversial points in the script was the depiction of Reagan telling his wife during a conversation about AIDS patients, &quot;They that live in sin shall die in sin.&quot; Co-writer Elizabeth Egloff acknowledged that there was no evidence that Reagan ever said this.

This line was dropped in the Showtime and DVD versions of the film. &quot;The Reagans&quot; producers, Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, have insisted that every fact (but not every line of dialogue) was supported by at least two sources. However, according to Reagans&#x27; daughter Patti Davis, no family member or close friend of the Reagans was consulted by the filmmakers throughout the production.

Another factor which has motivated certain critics to claim bias was that Reagan was played by James Brolin, whose wife Barbra Streisand is an outspoken liberal.

Barbra Streisand criticized CBS&#x27;s decision not to screen &quot;The Reagans&quot; as a &quot;sad day for artistic freedom&quot; and said the network &quot;caved in to right wing Republican pressure&quot;. Patti Davis commented that CBS did the &quot;right thing&quot; in pulling it from schedules.

Brolin would later play Governor Rob Ritchie, a fictional Republican candidate for the Presidency in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, while his son Josh would play the 43rd President George W. Bush in the 2008 Oliver Stone film &quot;W.&quot;

<text>A Journal of the Plague Year: Being Observations or Memorials, Of the most Remarkable Occurrences, As well Publick as Private, which happened in London During the last Great Visitation In 1665, commonly called A Journal of the Plague Year, is a book by Daniel Defoe, first published in March 1722. It is an account of one man&#x27;s experiences of the year 1665, in which the bubonic plague struck the city of London in what became known as the Great Plague of London, the last epidemic of plague in that city. The book is told somewhat chronologically, though without sections or chapter headings, and with frequent digressions and repetitions.

Presented as an eyewitness account of the events at the time, it was written in the years just prior to the book&#x27;s first publication in March 1722. Defoe was only five years old in 1665 when the Great Plague took place, and the book itself was published under the initials &quot;H. F.&quot; and is probably based on the journals of Defoe&#x27;s uncle, Henry Foe, who, like &#x27;H. F.&#x27;, was a saddler who lived in the Whitechapel district of East London.

In the book, Defoe goes to great pains to achieve an effect of verisimilitude, identifying specific neighbourhoods, streets, and even houses in which events took place. Additionally, it provides tables of casualty figures and discusses the credibility of various accounts and anecdotes received by the narrator.

The book is often compared to the actual, contemporary accounts of the plague in the diary of Samuel Pepys. Defoe&#x27;s account, which appears to include much research, is far more systematic and detailed than Pepys&#x27;s first-person account.
== Classification ==

How the &quot;Journal&quot; is to be classified has been disputed. It was initially presented and read as a work of nonfiction, but by the 1780s the work&#x27;s fictional status was accepted. Debate continued as to whether Defoe could be regarded as the work&#x27;s author rather than merely its editor. Edward Wedlake Brayley wrote in 1835 that the &quot;Journal&quot; is &quot;emphatically, not a fiction, not based on fiction ... great injustice is done to [Defoe&#x27;s] memory so to represent it.&quot; Brayley takes pains to compare Defoe&#x27;s account with known &quot;bona fide&quot; accounts such as &quot;Loimologia&quot; by Dr. Nathaniel Hodges (1672), the diary of Samuel Pepys, and Thomas Vincent&#x27;s &quot;God&#x27;s Terrible Voice in the City by Plague and Fire&quot; (1667), as well as primary sources. This view was also held by Watson Nicholson – writing in 1919 – who argued that &quot;there is not one single statement in the &quot;Journal&quot;, pertinent to the history of the Great Plague in London, that has not been verified during the course of this investigation&quot;, and &quot;we are compelled to class the &quot;Journal of the Plague Year&quot; with authentic histories.&quot; It is, according to Nicholson, &quot;a faithful record of historical facts ... [and] was so intended by the author.&quot; At least one modern literary critic, Frank Bastian, has agreed that &quot;the invented detail is ... small and inessential&quot; and that the &quot;Journal&quot; &quot;stands closer to our idea of history than to that of fiction&quot;, and that &quot;any doubts that remain whether to label it &quot;fiction&quot; or &quot;history&quot; arise from the ambiguities inherent in those words.&quot;

Other literary critics have argued that the work should be regarded as a work of imaginative fiction, and thus can justifiably be described as an &quot;historical novel&quot;. This view was held by Everett Zimmerman, who wrote that &quot;It is the intensity of the focus on the narrator that makes &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; more like a novel than like ... history.&quot; Indeed, Defoe&#x27;s use of the narrator &quot;H.F.&quot;, and his initial presentation of the &quot;Journal&quot; as being the recollections of an eye-witness to the plague, is the major sticking point for critics who consider it more of a &quot;romance&quot; – &quot;one of the peculiar class of compositions which hovers between romance and history&quot; as it was described by Sir Walter Scott – than a historical account. Walter George Bell, a historian of the plague, noted that Defoe should not be considered to be a historian because he uses his sources uncritically.

Scott&#x27;s somewhat ambiguous view of the nature of the &quot;Journal&quot; was shared by Defoe&#x27;s first major biographer, Walter Wilson, who wrote in &quot;Memoir of the Life and Times of Daniel De Foe&quot; (1830) about it that &quot;[Defoe] has contrived to mix up so much that is authentic with the fabrications of his own brain, that it is impossible to distinguish one from the other; and he has given the whole such a likeness to the dreadful original, as to confound the sceptic, and encircle him in his enchantments.&quot; In Wilson&#x27;s view the work is an &quot;alliance between history and fiction&quot; in which one continually morphs into the other and back again. This view is shared by John Richetti who calls the &quot;Journal&quot; a type of &quot;pseudohistory&quot;, a &quot;thickly factual, even grossly truthful book&quot; in which &quot;the imagination ... flares up occasionally and dominates those facts.&quot;

These alternative conceptualisations of the &quot;Journal&quot; – as fiction, history, or history-cum-fiction – continue to exist.

==Adaptations==

*In 1945, the syndicated radio programme &quot;The Weird Circle&quot; adapted the novel into a condensed 30-minute drama.
*The 1979 Mexican film &quot;El Año de la Peste&quot; (&quot;The Year of the Plague&quot;), directed by Mexican director Felipe Cazals from a screenplay written by Gabriel García Márquez, was based on &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot;.
*The Oscar-nominated 1999 German stop motion animated short film &quot;Periwig Maker&quot; is based on &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot;.
*A 2016 BBC Radio 4 play adapted the novel into a 60-minute drama.
&quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; also served as the initial inspiration for Anthony Clarvoe&#x27;s play &quot;The Living&quot;.

==In popular culture==

A supernatural copy of the work appears in &quot;The Magnus Archives&quot;, wherein it is able to cause buildings to become infected; one character describes his childhood home being destroyed by the book &quot;in a collapse of diseased brick and septic foundations.&quot;

References to the book&#x27;s title have been made in Michael D. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Plague Journal&quot;, where the narrator and main character chooses the title to describe the theme of the book (jokingly referring to himself as a modern-day Defoe) and Norman Spinrad&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Journals of the Plague Years&quot;, a satirical novel about a sexually transmitted viral disease that cannot be defeated by vaccines, referencing how AIDS was in its earliest days known as &quot;the gay plague&quot;.

A comparison of plague-driven behaviour described by Defoe and the COVID-19 crisis of 2020 is discussed in &quot;Persistent Patterns of Behavior: Two Infectious Disease Outbreaks 350 Years Apart&quot;, an article in the journal &quot;Economic Inquiry&quot;, and also in a commentary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.
