<text>ACT New Zealand (), also known as the ACT Party or simply ACT (), is a right-wing, classical liberal, right-libertarian, and conservative political party in New Zealand. It is currently led by David Seymour, and is in coalition with the National and New Zealand First parties, as part of the Sixth National government.

&quot;ACT&quot; is an acronym of the name of the Association of Consumers and Taxpayers, a pressure group that was founded in 1993 by former National Party MP Derek Quigley and former Labour Party MP Roger Douglas, a figure of the New Right who served as minister of finance under the Fourth Labour Government. Douglas&#x27; neoliberal economic policies, dubbed Rogernomics, transformed New Zealand&#x27;s economy from a protectionist one into a free market through extensive deregulation.

After Labour lost the 1990 election in a wipeout and its neoliberal faction lost influence, ACT was built mostly by Douglas&#x27; former party supporters as a new political party for 1996. The introduction of proportional representation gave minor parties a greatly increased chance of getting into parliament. Former Labour MP Richard Prebble unexpectedly won the safe Labour seat of Wellington Central, and served as ACT party leader from after the election until 2004. Under Prebble&#x27;s leadership the party held nine seats in Parliament. Rodney Hide served as leader from 2004 to 2011. ACT was briefly led by former National Party leader Don Brash for the 2011 election, after which the party caucus was reduced to one seat.

ACT gave support to the Fifth National Government from to 2017. It is currently led by David Seymour, who became the party&#x27;s leader in October 2014 and has been an elected MP of the party since September 2014. During the 2017 election, ACT retained its sole seat in Epsom and received 0.5% of the party vote. ACT rebounded in the 2020 election, winning 10 seats with 7.6% of the party vote. In the 2023 election ACT increased its share of the party vote to 8.6% and picked up an additional seat—the party&#x27;s best result since its founding.

== Principles ==

According to former party leader Rodney Hide, ACT&#x27;s values are &quot;individual freedom, personal responsibility, doing the best for our natural environment and for smaller, smarter government in its goals of a prosperous economy, a strong society, and a quality of life that is the envy of the world&quot;. ACT states that it adheres to classical-liberal and small (or limited) government principles coupled with what the party considers as a high regard for individual freedom and personal responsibility. ACT sets out its values:
* The principal object of the Party is to promote an open and benevolent society in which individual New Zealanders are free to achieve their full potential.
* That individuals are the rightful owners of their own lives and therefore have inherent freedoms and responsibilities.
* That the proper purpose of government is to protect such freedoms and not to assume such responsibilities.
* All people should be equal before the law regardless of race, gender, sexuality, religion or political belief.
* Freedom of expression is essential to a free society and must be promoted, protected and preserved without restriction other than for incitement, criminal nuisance or defamation.
* Citizenship and permanent residency should be subject to applicants affirming New Zealand&#x27;s values.

==Policies and ideology==

ACT has been characterised as a conservative, classical liberal and libertarian party, although its stances have changed under successive leadership and the party&#x27;s support base has drawn a &quot;big tent&quot; and a &quot;broad church&quot; of voters. ACT&#x27;s platform featured conservative populist policies under former leaders Richard Prebble (in office: 1996–2004) and Rodney Hide (2004–2011). Under the leadership of David Seymour (in office from 2014 onwards), commentators have identified a shift in policy to a more libertarian outlook. Seymour has stated that he does not view populism as the way to govern a country or to stimulate growth, and has accused the centre-left New Zealand Labour Party of engaging in populism in its policies on business, spending and tax. The ACT Party emphasises the importance of property rights.

ACT wants to reduce or remove some government programmes which it sees as unnecessary and wasteful, and to increase self-reliance by encouraging individuals to take responsibility to pay for services traditionally paid for by governments. Under leader Rodney Hide, ACT New Zealand had primarily focused on two main policy areas: taxation and crime (law-and-order issues). At the 2011 general election, ACT advocated lowering tax rates and also supported something approaching a flat tax, in which tax rates would not be graduated based on wealth or income, so that every taxpayer would pay the same proportion of their income in tax. The flat tax-rate that ACT proposed was approximately 15%, with no tax on the first $25,000 for those who opt out of state-provided accident, sickness and healthcare cover. , the party proposed reducing GST and decreasing the marginal tax rate paid by those on the median wage, but did not advocate a flat tax rate.

During the 2020 general election, the ACT party campaigned on a broad policy platform. It prioritised economic recovery (&quot;see: &quot;), keeping national debt low, and signing up to a CANZUK agreement which would enable free movement of people and goods between the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and Australia. The party wants to protect freedom of expression and to limit funding for universities that do not uphold freedom of speech on campus. It supports immigration while it calls for compulsory measures for immigrants to assimilate and for limiting citizenship or permanent-residency status to those who pledge to uphold the values of New Zealand.

===Law and order===
On its website, ACT states &quot;that all New Zealanders should have the same fundamental rights, regardless of race, religion, sexuality or gender&quot;. The party says &quot;the rights of victims should trump the rights of criminals&quot; and has a number of tough-on-crime policies focused primarily on trying to control gangs. Party leader, David Seymour, wants to reintroduce the &quot;three strikes law&quot; (repealed in 2022 by the Labour Government) and to impose three-year prison sentences—without parole—on anyone who commits three burglaries. ACT advocates repealing New Zealand&#x27;s 2019 firearms legislation, and taking a &quot;tougher&quot; stance on criminals who repeatedly offend and on those found guilty of violent crimes, while also supporting rehabilitation programs.

In September 2022, the ACT Party proposed fitting ankle bracelets on young offenders aged between 11 and 14 to combat juvenile crime, particularly ram-raiding. Party leader Seymour argued that ankle bracelets were non-intrusive and would allow police to monitor young offenders. In response, Police Minister Chris Hipkins stated that the Labour Government was not considering the use of ankle bracelets for young offenders but would keep &quot;all options on the table&quot;. National Party leader Christopher Luxon and education spokesperson Erica Stanford initially indicated that they would not support ACT&#x27;s ankle-bracelet policy, with Stanford describing it as &quot;heartbreaking&quot;. New Zealand rugby-league player Sir Graham Lowe criticised the ankle-bracelet policy, while Waikato retailer Ash Parmer supported it. In November 2022, National reversed its initial opposition to fitting young offenders with ankle bracelets; with justice spokesperson Paul Goldsmith stating that a law change was necessary to impose electronic monitoring or intensive supervision on child offenders aged under 12 years.

In May 2023, Seymour announced that ACT, if elected into government, would build youth-detention centres run by the Department of Corrections. ACT&#x27;s proposed policies include shifting management of youth offenders from Oranga Tamariki (the Ministry for Children) to the Corrections Department, investing NZ$677 million into combating youth crime over the following four years – including NZ$500 million on the construction of 200 new &quot;youth justice beds&quot;, and $44 million per year to operate these facilities.

===Social issues===
Members of ACT&#x27;s caucus in parliament voted five to four in favour of the Civil Union Act 2004 which gave the option of legal recognition to (among others) same-sex couples. A majority within the caucus also supported the legalisation of brothels by the Prostitution Reform Act 2003. In 2005, both of ACT&#x27;s MPs, Rodney Hide and Heather Roy, voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill 2005, which would have banned the possibility of introducing same-sex marriage in New Zealand in the future perspective.

In 2013, leader John Banks (the party&#x27;s sole MP from 2011 to 2014) voted in favour of the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill at its third reading, a law which legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand.

ACT leader David Seymour supported the legalisation of assisted dying. In 2018, he introduced a member&#x27;s bill, the End of Life Choice Bill, which aimed to legalise euthanasia in New Zealand. The law passed in 2019, was approved by the public in a 2020 referendum, and took full effect in 2021. Grant Duncan cited the euthanasia law as an example of ACT neoliberalism. In 2020, Seymour voted for the Abortion Legislation Act which introduced abortion on request. However, he criticised a particular aspect of this law which created &quot;free protest zones&quot; which would ban protests near abortion clinics, saying this limits freedom of expression. 
In 2021, ACT expressed support for liberalisation of surrogacy law so as to facilitate availability of surrogate services to heterosexual and same-sex couples as well. (Currently, New Zealand law permits altruistic surrogacy only.)

===Māori issues===
ACT proposes abolition of the Māori electorate seats in the New Zealand Parliament, arguing the seats are &quot;an anachronism and offensive to the principle of equal citizenship&quot; and that Māori MPs have been elected in general elections on other lists without special assistance. The party also wants to reduce the number of MPs in parliament from 120 to 100.

In March 2022, ACT campaigned on holding a referendum on Māori co-governance arrangements as a condition for entering into coalition with the National Party. Seymour has argued that the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi was not a partnership between the New Zealand Crown and Māori, and that co-governance arrangements created resentment and division. In addition, ACT announced that it would introduce a new law defining the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi if elected into government following the 2023 election. This law would only come into effect following a referendum held at the 2026 general election. ACT&#x27;s proposed referendum and law would affect co-governance arrangements at several Crown Research Institutes, state-owned enterprises and healthcare providers such as Te Aka Whai Ora (the Māori Health Authority). However, Seymour indicated that the new law would preserve existing co-governance arrangements with the Waikato, Ngāi Tahu, Tūhoe and Whanganui iwi (tribes).

Māori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith described ACT&#x27;s proposed co-governance referendum and policies as being motivated by racism and reflecting a Pākehā unwillingness to share power. Similarly, Waikato leader Rahui Papa claimed that ACT&#x27;s co-governance policies clashed with the second and third articles of the treaty which (he argued) guaranteed Māori participation in the social sector. In response, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern reiterated her government&#x27;s commitment to co-governance arrangements. Meanwhile, National Party leader Christopher Luxon refused to commit to a referendum on co-governance, but acknowledged that further clarity on co-governance was needed.

In October 2022, ACT released a discussion document entitled &quot;Democracy or co-government?&quot; which proposed a new Treaty Principles Act that would end the focus on partnership between Māori and the Crown and interpret &quot;tino rangatiratanga&quot; solely as property rights. By contrast, most scholars of the Māori language define &quot;tino rangatiratanga&quot; as the equivalent of &quot;self-determination&quot; in the English language. The proposed Treaty Principles Act does not mention Māori, the Crown, iwi (tribes), and hapū (subgroups) but refers only to &quot;New Zealanders&quot;. ACT Party leader Seymour refused to identify whom his party had consulted when developing its co-governance and Treaty of Waitangi policies, particularly its redefinition of &quot;tino rangatiratanga&quot; as property rights. As part of ACT&#x27;s non-racial (colour-blind) policies, its social-development spokesperson Karen Chhour advocated the abolition of Te Aka Whai Ora.

Following the 2023 election and the formation of a National-led coalition government, ACT embarked on a public information campaign in early February 2024 to promote its Treaty Principles Bill. This campaign includes the creation of a new website called &quot;treaty.nz,&quot; which has a Questions and Answers section outlining the party&#x27;s approach to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and a video featuring Seymour. Seymour also contested claims that the opposition was trying to rewrite or abolish the Treaty of Waitangi. The public information campaign also came after a leaked Justice Ministry memo claimed that the proposed bill clashed with the text of the Treaty.

===Climate change===

ACT went into the 2008 general election with a policy that in part stated &quot;New Zealand is not warming&quot; and that their policy goal was to ensure &quot;That no New Zealand government will ever impose needless and unjustified taxation or regulation on its citizens in a misguided attempt to reduce global warming or become a world leader in carbon neutrality&quot;. In September 2008, ACT Party Leader Rodney Hide stated &quot;that the entire climate change – global warming hypothesis is a hoax, that the data and the hypothesis do not hold together, that Al Gore is a phoney and a fraud on this issue, and that the emissions trading scheme is a worldwide scam and swindle.&quot; The former party leader has been branded as an &quot;outspoken Kiwi climate change sceptic&quot;. In February 2016, ACT deleted this climate-change policy from their website, and party leader David Seymour criticised the Green Party for doing &quot;bugger all for the environment&quot;.

ACT placed Chris Baillie fourth on its party list of candidates in the 2020 election; he has received criticism over his views on climate change, and been labelled a climate-change sceptic. In the runup to the 2020 election, Environmental Defence Society chief executive Gary Taylor said that even ACT had moved its position from where it had been. He was largely critical of the party, saying: &quot;ACT have been very outspoken about wanting to go hard to repeal a lot of climate change legislation, and I haven&#x27;t seen much from New Zealand First, mainly just silence.&quot; He also stated: &quot;I think the only upside from ACT really on climate change is they do seem to have moved from outright deniers – which is where the party was five years ago. [With] a strong ACT presence you could expect some of their radical and unhelpful policies to potentially be implemented, and that is frankly a scary proposition.&quot;

In early December 2020, the New Zealand Parliament officially declared a climate emergency, of which ACT was critical, stating, &quot;Today&#x27;s climate emergency was a triumph for post-rational politics with feelings rather than facts driving the Government&#x27;s response to climate change&quot;. The party supports repealing the 2019 &quot;Zero Carbon Act&quot;.

=== Foreign policy ===
In 2019, ACT expressed sympathy with the Hong Kong pro-democracy protestors during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests with party leader David Seymour speaking at a Hong Kong pro-democracy rally at the University of Auckland. The party argued that the New Zealand government should condemn efforts by the Chinese government to restrict freedom of speech in Hong Kong and criticised the Chinese Consulate-General for praising a Chinese student who had assaulted a pro-democracy activist in Auckland.

In response to the Israel–Hamas war, Seymour as ACT leader issued a statement in support of Israel and condemned Hamas terrorism. ACT also accused Labour Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta of not explicitly opposing Hamas&#x27; actions.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The name comes from the initials of the Association of Consumers and Taxpayers, founded in 1993 by Sir Roger Douglas and Derek Quigley. Douglas and Quigley intended the Association to serve as a pressure-group promoting Rogernomics—the name given to the radical free-market policies implemented by Douglas as Minister of Finance between 1984 and 1988. The Association grew out of the &#x27;Backbone club&#x27;, a ginger group in the Labour Party that supported Douglas and his policies. In 1996, New Zealand switched to using the MMP electoral system. The new electoral system gave smaller groups a much better chance of entering Parliament, and encouraged the Association to transform into a political party and contest elections. The nascent party&#x27;s manifesto was based upon a book written by Douglas entitled &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. Douglas served as ACT&#x27;s first leader, but soon stood aside for Richard Prebble (his old ally from their days in the Labour Party).

=== 1996–2004: Prebble&#x27;s leadership===

Under Douglas, ACT had languished at 1% in opinion polls, but with Prebble&#x27;s populist rhetoric the party increased in support. In the , ACT fielded 56 list candidates. Prebble won the electorate, and with 6.10% of the total party vote, ACT also sent seven list MPs to the 45th New Zealand Parliament.

In the , ACT obtained 7.04% of the party vote, making it eligible for nine list MPs.

In the , ACT obtained 7.14% of the party vote, making it eligible for nine list MPs.

On 2 December 2004, both Douglas and Quigley announced that they would step down as patrons of ACT. They stated as the reason that they wished to have more freedom to disagree with the party publicly.

=== 2005 election ===
Prebble&#x27;s sudden departure from the leadership of ACT in 2004 signalled a decline in the party&#x27;s electoral fortunes. Rodney Hide led ACT into the . It obtained 1.51% of the party vote, but due to Hide winning the seat of Epsom, it did not need to obtain the necessary 5% threshold of the party vote. This was only enough to allow one list MP Heather Roy, to join Hide in parliament.

=== 2008–2011: First term in government===
In the 2008 New Zealand general election, ACT fielded 61 list candidates, starting with Rodney Hide, Heather Roy, Sir Roger Douglas, John Boscawen, David Garrett and Hilary Calvert. The election marked an improvement in ACT&#x27;s fortunes. Hide retained his Epsom seat and ACT&#x27;s share of the party vote increased to 3.65% (up from the 1.5% gained in the 2005 election). The combination allowed the party five MPs in total.

In addition, the National Party won the most seats overall, forming a minority government, the Fifth National Government of New Zealand, with the support of ACT as well as the Māori Party and United Future. John Key offered both Hide and Roy posts as Ministers outside Cabinet: Hide became Minister of Local Government, Minister for Regulatory Reform and Associate Minister of Commerce, while Roy became Minister of Consumer Affairs, Associate Minister of Defence and Associate Minister of Education.

After 2008, some caucus MPs and organisational members became dissatisfied with ACT&#x27;s coalition partner status and argued at ACT&#x27;s national conference (27 February 2010) that there were insufficient fiscal responsibility policy gains for their party and that the National Party had slid from its earlier commitment to the politics of fiscal responsibility over the course of the previous decade. Throughout 2009, there had been at least one reported ACT caucus coup attempt against Hide&#x27;s leadership, believed to have been led by Deputy Leader Heather Roy and Roger Douglas. However, it faltered when Prime Minister Key supported Hide&#x27;s retention and threatened a snap election. In addition, the party&#x27;s polling of a lowly one to two percent in most opinion polls meant only Heather Roy might accompany Hide after any forthcoming general election, if Hide retained ACT&#x27;s Epsom pivotal electorate seat.

On 28 April 2011, Hide announced that he was resigning the ACT leadership in favour of former National Party leader and Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash who joined the party that morning. Brash&#x27;s leadership was unanimously approved by the party board and parliamentary caucus on 30 April. Brash promised to focus the party on controlling government debt, equality between Māori and non-Māori, and rethinking the Emissions Trading Scheme, with a target of getting 15 percent of the party vote in the next election.

In November 2011, a recording of a conversation held between John Key and the former National Party member and former Mayor of Auckland City John Banks, who had been selected as the new ACT candidate in Epsom, was leaked to &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot;. 3 News also obtained copies of the recording suggesting the two politicians were discussing issues related to ACT New Zealand&#x27;s leadership. Media dubbed the affair teapot tape.

=== 2011 election: Decline ===
In the 2011 New Zealand general election, ACT fielded 55 list candidates, starting with new leader Don Brash, Catherine Isaac, Don Nicolson, John Banks, David Seymour and Chris Simmons. The election was a disappointment for ACT, with the party&#x27;s worst election result since it began in 1996. John Banks retained the Epsom seat for ACT, however the 34.2% majority held by Rodney Hide was severely cut back to 6.3% as large numbers of Labour and Green voters in Epsom tactically split their vote and gave their electorate vote to the National candidate Paul Goldsmith. Nationwide, ACT received only 1.07% of the party vote, placing eighth out of 13 on party vote percentage. As a result, ACT were only entitled to one seat in the new Parliament, filled by John Banks. Subsequently, Don Brash announced that he had stepped down as leader during his speech on election night. Following the 2011 general election John Banks stated that he believed that the ACT brand &quot;...just about had its use-by date...&quot; and needed to be renamed and relaunched.

Their previous partners, the National Party, again won the most seats overall, and formed a minority government. The Fifth National Government of New Zealand had ACT support as well as that of United Future and the Māori Party, providing the coalition with confidence and supply.

=== 2014 election ===

At the ACT Board meeting of 2 February 2014, Jamie Whyte became the party&#x27;s leader-elect, and David Seymour was made the ACT candidate for Epsom. Kenneth Wang was appointed deputy leader on 15 April 2014. In the September 2014 general election, Seymour won his seat, and ACT moved from seventh to sixth place, despite a decline in their share of the popular vote. Seymour took over as party leader on 3 October 2014.

=== 2017 election ===

Wang resigned as deputy leader on 9 July 2017, the same day ACT released its party list; Beth Houlbrooke was announced as his replacement.

The party list had 39 candidates, none of whom were elected. Party leader David Seymour was re-elected in the Epsom electorate, giving the party its only seat.

=== 2020–2023 term ===
In the run-up to the 2020 general election, ACT rose in opinion polls, from under 1% to close to 8%. This rise was attributed to Seymour&#x27;s personal popularity. Following the election, held on 17 October (postponed from September), ACT increased their share of the party vote to 7.6%, winning 10 seats including Seymour&#x27;s Epsom seat and nine from the party list. This was the party&#x27;s best-ever result. Some political analysists attributed ACT&#x27;s strong result as partly benefiting from the collapse in support for the National Party and New Zealand First.

In late April 2021, the ACT party sponsored motion asking the New Zealand Parliament to debate and vote on the issue of human rights abuses against the Uyghur ethnic minority community in China&#x27;s Xinjiang province. In early May, the incumbent Labour Party revised the motion to raise concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang but omitting the term genocide, which was subsequently adopted by the New Zealand Parliament on 5 May. In response, the Chinese Embassy claimed that the motion made &quot;groundless accusations&quot; of human rights abuses against China and constituted an interference in China&#x27;s internal affairs.

On 19 May 2021, the ACT Party opposed Green Party MP Golriz Ghahraman&#x27;s motion calling for members of parliament to recognise the rights of Palestinians to self-determination and statehood while reaffirming its support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Deputy Leader Van Velden justified ACT&#x27;s opposition to the Green motion on the basis of Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March&#x27;s tweet that said &quot;From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!.&quot;

===2023–present: Coalition with National===

Final results of the 2023 general election indicated that ACT won 8.64% of the party vote, resulting in 11 seats. Seymour retained his Epsom seat and Deputy Leader Brooke van Velden won the Tāmaki electorate. In November 2023, ACT entered into a coalition deal with the National party to form part of the Sixth National Government of New Zealand.

As part of National&#x27;s coalition agreement with ACT, the Government would adopt ACT&#x27;s policies of restoring interest deductibility for rental properties and pet bonds. In addition to adopting National&#x27;s youth crime and gang policies, the new Government would adopt ACT&#x27;s policies of rewriting firearms legislation. The new Government would also scrap the previous Labour Government&#x27;s fair pay agreements, proposed hate speech legislation, co-governance policies, Auckland light rail, Three Waters reform programme, and Māori Health Authority. The Government would also establish a new Ministry for Regulation headed by Seymour that would review the quality of new and existing legislation. While National did not support Act&#x27;s proposed referendum on the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, the Government would introduce a Treaty Principles Act and amend existing Treaty of Waitangi legislation to focus on the &quot;original intent of the legislation.&quot;

Within the National-led coalition government, Seymour became the first Minister for Regulation and was designated as Deputy Prime Minister from 31 May 2025. Van Velden became Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety. Nicole McKee became Minister for Courts and Associate Minister of Justice (firearms). Andrew Hoggard was appointed as Minister for Biosecurity and Food Safety while Karen Chhour was appointed as Minister for Children and Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence. Simon Court was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Minister for Infrastructure and RMA Reform.

On 7 February 2024, the ACT Party launched a campaign to support its Treaty Principles Bill, aiming to &quot;restore the meaning of the Treaty of Waitangi to what was actually written and signed in 1840.&quot; ACT also reiterated its call for a referendum on the Treaty&#x27;s application if the bill progresses past the initial stages. Opposition to the bill included criticism from Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, who accused Seymour of deliberately trying to divide New Zealand, and outgoing Labour MP Kelvin Davis, who stated that his party will continue to oppose the &quot;Pākehā Government spiders&quot;.

On 7 June 2024, Stuff journalist Tova O&#x27;Brien reported that allegations of intimidation, unfair treatment of women and a &quot;trainwreck campaign&quot; within the ACT party had led six staff members and volunteers to resign following the 2023 general election. In addition, the party&#x27;s board was facing a vote of no confidence. Complainants likened elements of the 2023 election campaign to the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; and alleged that candidates and volunteers were bullied. In response to the allegations, the ACT party confirmed that it had conducted an independent review into its campaign. The party&#x27;s president Catherine Isaac stated that the party had accepted the review&#x27;s recommendations and acknowledged that political campaigns could be stressful on people, who also had to balance their lives and careers. During ACT&#x27;s annual rally on 9 June, Seymour downplayed allegations of a &quot;culture of fear&quot; within the ACT party and reiterated the party&#x27;s support for the review&#x27;s recommendations. In his speech, Seymour said that the party&#x27;s support had grown by 1,000 percent in the past five years and set out a 15% voter target for the 2026 general election.

In early July 2024, ACT invoked the &quot;agree to disagree&quot; provision of its coalition agreement after the National-led government decided to progress the Fair Digital News Bargaining Bill, which had been introduced by the previous Labour Government.

<text>Shenzhou 5 (, see ) was the first human spaceflight mission of the Chinese space program, launched on 15 October 2003. The Shenzhou spacecraft was launched on a Long March 2F launch vehicle. There had been four previous flights of uncrewed Shenzhou missions since 1999. China became the third country in the world to have independent human spaceflight capability after the Soviet Union (later, Russia) and the United States. As of , this mission marks the last time an astronaut was launched alone to conduct an entirely solo orbital mission.

== Crew ==
== Mission parameters ==
* Mass: 7,840 kg
* Perigee: 332 km
* Apogee: 336 km
* Inclination: 42.4°
* Period: 91.2 minutes
* NSSDC ID: 2003-045A

== Mission highlights ==
Shenzhou 5 was launched at 09:00 (UTC+08:00) from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, a launch base in the Gobi Desert in Gansu province, entering orbit above Earth at 09:10 (UTC+08:00) with astronaut Yang Liwei, a 38-year-old lieutenant colonel in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and former fighter pilot. The space launch made China the third country to independently launch a person into outer space, after the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the Shenzhou was the result of a crewed space program which began in 1992.

Neither the launch nor the reentry was televised live, but the time of both launch and reentry had been widely announced beforehand, and news appeared on China Central Television within minutes after both events.

=== Orbital spaceflight ===

The Shenzhou spacecraft made 14 orbits and landed 21 hours after launch. It reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at 06:04 (UTC+08:00) on 16 October 2003 (22:04 UTC 15 Oct 2003), its parachute opened normally and the astronaut said he was feeling fine. The landing happened at 06:28 (UTC+08:00), just from the planned landing site in Inner Mongolia, according to the government. The orbital module of the spacecraft stayed in orbit; it continued with automated experiments until 16 March 2004 and decayed on 30 May.

Premier Wen Jiabao congratulated the country&#x27;s first person in space after his safe return to Earth. Yang emerged from the reentry capsule about 15 minutes later and waved to members of the recovery team.

The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center later declared China&#x27;s first crewed spacecraft mission to be successful after Yang Liwei emerged from his capsule.

=== Yang&#x27;s experience in space ===
During the flight Yang wore diapers. When questioned about his experience aboard Shenzhou 5, he stated &quot;Better not to piss in diaper...Baby doesn&#x27;t like it, neither does an adult.&quot;

In addition, Yang reported abnormal vibrations that appeared 120 seconds after launch (pogo oscillation), which he described as &quot;very uncomfortable&quot;. As a consequence, corrective measures were taken to the design of the following CZ-2F carrier rocket for the Shenzhou 6 flight.

== Politics ==
The launch was widely heralded in the official Chinese state media with newspapers devoting far more space to the launch than any recent event. While the Chinese media portrayed the launch as a triumph for Chinese science and technology, it has also been pointed out in both Chinese and Western media that Yang Liwei showed the flag of the United Nations in addition to the flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The state media also reported that crop seeds from Taiwan were brought aboard the spacecraft. Both the Chief Executives of Hong Kong and Macau sent letters congratulating all the people involved in the mission and also the central government.

General Secretary and President Hu Jintao, in an official celebration at the Great Hall of the People, hailed China&#x27;s success in launching its first crewed spacecraft into orbit, describing it as &quot;an honour for our great motherland, an indicator for the initial victory of the country&#x27;s first crewed space flight and for an historic step taken by the Chinese people in their endeavor to surmount the peak of the world&#x27;s science and technology&quot;.

Hu added, &quot;The Party and the people will never forget those who have set up this outstanding merit in the space industry for the motherland, the people and the nation&quot;. He also expressed congratulations and respect to specialists and people who have contributed to China&#x27;s space mission development on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council and the Central Military Commission.

The launch was met with praise from around the world. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi called the launch &quot;a great feat&quot;. United States President George W. Bush congratulated Chinese President Hu and wished China continued success. A spokesperson for the United States Department of State said that the United States wished to &quot;applaud China&#x27;s success in becoming only the third country to launch people into space&quot;. NASA Administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe called Shenzhou 5 an &quot;important achievement in human exploration&quot; and wished China &quot;a continued safe human space flight program&quot;.

The spacecraft has since featured prominently in festivities and celebrations not only in China but also in foreign countries, such as official North Korean commemorative stamps showing the first Chinese crewed spacecraft alongside North Korea&#x27;s first satellite Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1.

<text>The joropo, better known as Música Llanera, is a musical style resembling the fandango, and an accompanying dance. It originated in the Llanos of Venezuela 300 years ago and it has African, European and Native South American influences. There are different joropo variants: tuyero, oriental, and llanero. It is a fundamental genre of Venezuelan &quot;música criolla&quot; (creole music). It is also the most popular &quot;folk rhythm&quot;: the well-known song &quot;Alma Llanera&quot; is a joropo, considered the unofficial national anthem of Venezuela.

In 1882 it became Venezuela&#x27;s national dance and music. Formerly, the Spanish word meant &quot;a party&quot;, but now it has come to mean a type of music and dance that identifies Venezuelans. In the 18th century, the llaneros started using the word instead of , which was used at the time for party and dance.

== Venezuela ==

=== Tuyero ===
Central joropo () is also known as (&quot;Tuyan&quot;), (&quot;Tuyan joropo&quot;) or (&quot;Tuyan beat&quot;).

Characteristic of the central states of Venezuela, like Aragua and Miranda, eastern Carabobo and northern Guárico, central joropo, or tuyero (as practiced in the Valles del Tuy along the Tuy River) is sung accompanied by harp (, sometimes replaced by guitar) and maracas. Unlike the nylon strings of the llanera harp, the central joropo harp also uses metal strings, which gave its unique sound. The central joropo singer also plays the maracas and dances, requiring just two performers: the harpist, and the singer-maraquero. Joropo harpists prefer the name &quot;arpisto&quot; rather than , the usual Spanish word for &quot;harpist&quot;. The central joropo him the same considerations are applied around the passage and hit burrowing joropo, except speed, which is slightly lower. Another important distinction is that the central joropo revuelta, kind of colonial origin is present, basically consists of a chain of musical sections of fixed forms, in the same tone as a Baroque suite, without interruption, but with surprising twists. The movements of the revuelta are called passage; input or call Yaguazo, Yaguazo, and Marisela Guabina input. Sometimes they can call Marisela added to them, and even a small coda. The revuelta is thus equivalent to the batch or shift dance, and its length is probably the reason for its gradual decline in use, being replaced by the execution of the parts in isolation. The arrangement of these sections is of sequential nature, unlike &quot;golpes&quot; of Llanero joropo, having a cyclic condition. The most characteristic part of tuyero joropo, the Tuyera Revuelta consists of four sections: the exhibition (passage), development (yaguazo and guabina), the instrumental coda named Marisela, and an end known as &quot;monkey call.&quot; They are central joropo own beats flowers and quitapesares. The most famous passages tuyeros are The Hermit Mario Diaz, Dawn tuyero of Cipriano Moreno and Pablo Hidalgo, and &quot;El gato enmochilado&quot; (Cat in a bag) by Fulgencio Aquino. Caraqueños and central musicians adopted central joropo as inspiration for their works, as in the case of Marisela (Sebastián Díaz Peña), the &quot;Alma Llanera&quot; (Pedro Elias Gutierrez), the waltz &quot;Quitapesares&quot; (Carlos Bonet) and even Creole Sonatina Juan Bautista Square. Central joropo lyrics are of a sly, sardonic nature, in contrast to the forceful and violent own burrowing joropo, whose &quot;contrapunteos&quot; (counterpoints) end up not infrequently in sets and fights.

The most characteristic of tuyero folklore piece, &quot;The Tuyero Revolt&quot; (&quot;Revuelta tuyera&quot;), consists of four sections: the exhibition (passage), development (yaguaso and guabina), the instrumental coda (&quot;Marisela&quot;) and an end known as &quot;the call monkey&quot;. The most famous tuyero passages are &quot;El ermitaño&quot; of Mario Diaz, &quot;Amanecer tuyero&quot; of Cipriano Moreno and Pablo Hidalgo, and &quot;El gato enmochilado&quot; of Fulgencio Aquino.

=== Eastern joropo ===
Characteristic of the northeastern region of Venezuela, specifically of Sucre, Nueva Esparta and the north of Anzoátegui and Monagas states. In this particular type of joropo, the melodic instrument par excellence is the mandolin. However, the eastern mandolin (eight nylon strings), violin, harmonica and a small accordion called &quot;cuereta&quot; also have a major role in the oriental musical folklore. The so-called &quot;joropo with refrain&quot; consists of two sections: the first section or &quot;hit&quot; is traditionally a fixed melody in rhythm that is repeated two or more times; the second section or &quot;chorus&quot; is an improvised melody over a fixed harmonic rhythm cycle is . Note that in the eastern joropo, cuatro and maracas are executed in a much freer and more complex than in the rest of Venezuelans joropos way. Likewise, it is important to mention that the musical tradition of the eastern region of Venezuela has many other forms besides the eastern joropo.

=== Guayanés joropo ===
Joropo in the Venezuelan region of Guayana is the product of the interaction of llaneros and eastern Bolivar state, specifically in Ciudad Bolívar. It is executed with the Guayanese mandolin (eight metal strings), cuatro and maracas. The &quot;Seis Guayanés&quot;, the Josa and Rompeluto highlight among the most famous Guyanese joropos.

=== Golpe tocuyano or larense joropo ===
Hailing from the West Central region of Venezuela, mainly the states of Lara, Portuguesa (Sierra de Portuguesa) and Yaracuy. Played by a variety of stringed instruments (Four, Middle Five, Five and Six) together with Tambora and maracas produce a very particular and unique sound among other Venezuelan joropos. Celebrity tocuyanos hits are &quot;Amalia Rosa&quot;, &quot;Montilla&quot;, &quot;Gavilan Tocuyano&quot; and &quot;Ah mundo! Barquisimeto&quot;, &quot;Los Dos Gavilanes&quot;, &quot;The Fright&quot;, &quot;Pajarillo Tocuyano&quot;, &quot;Garrote Encabullao&quot;, &quot;Fire Fire&quot;, among many others. Dancing in the number of members is six couples.

=== Quirpa ===
Legend says that this type of joropo is named after Jose Antonio Oquendo, who was nicknamed &quot;Quirpa&quot; . Burrowing harpist of the late nineteenth century who died of a stab wound. The quirpa uses ternary and tertiary bars and sometimes combined, with shifts of rhythm and musical accents .

=== Joropo llanero ===

Until the mid-twentieth century, and with regard to the region of the plains of Venezuela, the joropo word referring to a social event almost a fair- for a period that could vary from a few hours and even a full week. There participating local people or coming from various places, generally attracted by trade, where the central event it was the music, dance and contrapunteos. Burrowing joropo music was provided by a basic set consisting of Bandola, cuatro, maracas and singing. If there was no bandola, it could be replaced by a llanera harp, mandolin or violin. The genera of burrowing joropo are two: Passage: the more sedate, and generally known author. Its speed is approximately 152 bpm, and harmonic structure free, usually in two parts; Y Hit:. Anonymous author, although many of these strokes are attributed to composers of the early twentieth century The coup complies with certain recognizable melodic turns on fixed characteristic harmonic patterns that define its type. Singing is syllabic, that is, to each note of the melody corresponds to a syllable. The verses are octosyllabic and sometimes five syllables, all under contrafactum, ie the replacement of new texts in existing melodies. The stroke speed is greater than the passage (176–192 bpm). When the song is a story of an event or fantasy called the RAN, equivalent to the old Spanish romance. The blows are the basis for the buzzes or hums contrapunteo that between two or more opponents. The most common are the six law (major key), the bird (in a minor key), six numbering or six numerao (with transport augmentations in fourth grade), the Kirpa or quirpa, Gavan (in modes major and minor), the San Rafael, carnival, Chipola, the catira, the buzz buzzing, among the best known. The entreverao is the aggregation of two strokes, with a modulation of each other, usually to sing two people with different tessitura voice (baritone and tenor). As for the steps of the most frequent dance are valsiao, escobillao and footwork, in which, unlike the central joropo, feet off the floor rise. Family tree of performers llanera harp in Venezuela since the late nineteenth century to the present

==Dancing==
The Joropo folk dance in Venezuela is seen as a rich musical expression. This dance is greatly cherished and seen as the national dance and symbol of the nation. Joropo&#x27;s known as an umbrella genre that implements a variety in dance and vocals. Music is a substantive part of Joropo, and till this day, Venezuela is not in opposition to its popularity. Joropo is filled with artists who move between academic and popular music. It is adopted and still uses the hand turn, the movement of the feet, and waltz turns. First, the partners dance a type of waltz holding each other tightly. Then they stand facing each other and make small steps forward and backward as if sweeping the floor. Lastly they hold each other&#x27;s arms, and the woman does sweeping steps while the man stomps his feet along with the music&#x27;s rhythm. Joropo is a genre, emerged to represent Venezuela&#x27;s identity because of its popularity and by how much it was enjoyed across many regions in the nation.
The Joropo is played with the &quot;bandola&quot; or llanera harp (&quot;arpa llanera&quot;), &quot;cuatro&quot;, and maracas, making use of polyrhythmic patterns, especially of hemiola, and alternation of and meters. It was originally played, most often also sung, by the &quot;llaneros&quot;, the Venezuelan &quot;Llanos&quot;, (plains), and thus also called música llanera (ibid).

The singer and the harp or bandola may perform the main melody while a cuatro performs the accompaniment, adding its characteristic rhythmic, sharp percussive effect. The cuatro and the bandola are four-stringed instruments which are descendants of the Spanish guitar. The only real percussion instruments used are the maracas. Besides the genre and dance, the name &quot;joropo&quot; also means the performance, the event or occasion of performance.

==Evolution and more refined forms==
In modern times, several other instruments have been added to playing various parts in joropo performances, for instance, guitar, flute, clarinet, piano, and up to a complete symphony orchestra playing joropo arrangements.

<doc id="340931" wikidata="Q118358920" url="?curid=340931" title="Lawnchair Larry flight">
<text>On July 2, 1982, Larry Walters (April 19, 1949 – October 6, 1993) made a 45-minute flight in a homemade aerostat made of an ordinary lawn chair and 42 helium-filled weather balloons. The aircraft rose to an altitude of about , drifted from the point of liftoff in San Pedro, California, and entered controlled airspace near Long Beach Airport. During the final descent, the aircraft became entangled in power lines, but Walters was able to climb down safely. The flight attracted worldwide media attention and inspired a movie, a musical and numerous imitators.

==Background==
Lawrence Richard &quot;Larry&quot; Walters had often dreamed of flying, but was unable to become a pilot in the United States Air Force because of his poor eyesight. Therefore, he became a truck driver. He first thought of using weather balloons to fly at age 13, after seeing them hanging from the ceiling of a military surplus store. 

In 1982, he decided to try his flying idea. His intention was to float over the Mojave Desert and then use a pellet gun to burst some of the balloons in order to descend safely.

==Preparation and flight==
In mid-1982, Walters and his then-girlfriend, Carol Van Deusen, purchased 45 weather balloons from a military surplus store and helium tanks from California Toy Time Balloons. They used a forged requisition from his employer, FilmFair Studios, saying the balloons were for a television commercial. He purchased the lawn chair from Sears for $109.

On July 2, 1982, Walters attached 42 of the balloons (although he sometimes quoted 43 in interviews) to his lawn chair, filled them with helium, put on a parachute, and strapped himself into the chair in the backyard of a home at 1633 West 7th Street in San Pedro owned by his girlfriend Carol&#x27;s mother. He took his pellet gun, a CB radio, sandwiches, 2 liters of Coca-Cola, a pack of beer and a camera. When the cord that tied his lawn chair to his Jeep broke prematurely, before the end of a planned delay to notifying the authorities, Walters&#x27;s lawn chair rose rapidly to a height of about and was spotted from two commercial airliners. He slowly drifted over Long Beach and crossed the primary approach corridor of Long Beach Airport.

He was in contact with REACT, a citizens band radio monitoring organization, who recorded their conversation:

:REACT: What information do you wish me to tell [the airport] at this time as to your location and your difficulty?
:Larry: Ah, the difficulty is, ah, this was an unauthorized balloon launch, and, uh, I know I&#x27;m in a federal airspace, and, uh, I&#x27;m sure my ground crew has alerted the proper authority. But, uh, just call them and tell them I&#x27;m okay.
:REACT: Well, ah, stay safe and try not to chud it up.

After 45 minutes in the sky, Walters shot several balloons with a pellet gun, taking care not to unbalance the load. He then accidentally dropped his pellet gun overboard. Despite having taken a camera, he did not take any photos. He descended slowly, until the balloons&#x27; dangling cables became caught in a power line at 423 E 44th Way in Long Beach. The power line broke, causing a 20-minute electricity blackout. He landed unharmed.

==Aftermath==
Walters was immediately arrested by waiting members of the Long Beach Police Department. Regional safety inspector Neal Savoy was reported to have said, &quot;We know he broke some part of the Federal Aviation Act, and as soon as we decide which part it is, some type of charge will be filed. If he had a pilot&#x27;s license, we&#x27;d suspend that, but he doesn&#x27;t.&quot; Walters initially was fined $4,000 for violations under U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations, including operating an aircraft within an airport traffic area &quot;without establishing and maintaining two-way communications with the control tower.&quot; Walters appealed, and the fine was reduced to $1,500. A charge of operating a &quot;civil aircraft for which there is not currently in effect an airworthiness certificate&quot; was dropped, as it was not applicable to his class of aircraft.

Just after landing, Walters spoke to the press, saying:

He also said: 

The aircraft was dubbed &quot;Inspiration I&quot;. Lawn Chair Larry was awarded the title of &quot;At-Risk Survivor&quot; in the 1993 Darwin Awards.

Ten days after his flight, Walters appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. He was briefly in demand as a motivational speaker, and quit his job as a truck driver. He was featured in a Timex print ad in the early 1990s, but never made much money from his fame.

The lawn chair used in the flight was reportedly given to an admiring boy named Jerry, though Walters regretted doing so when the Smithsonian Institution asked him to donate it to its museum. Twenty years later, Jerry sent an email to Mark Barry, a pilot who had documented Walters&#x27;s story and dedicated a website to it, and identified himself. The chair was still sitting in his garage, attached to some of the original tethers and water jugs used as ballast. The chair was placed on loan to the San Diego Air and Space Museum, where it was exhibited in 2014. It was later donated to the Smithsonian. After being displayed at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia, the lawn chair is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

===Later life and death===
Later in his life, Walters hiked the San Gabriel Mountains and did volunteer work for the United States Forest Service. He later broke up with his girlfriend of 15 years and could only find work sporadically as a security guard. On October 6, 1993, at the age of 44, Walters died by suicide after shooting himself in the heart in Angeles National Forest.

==Other cluster ballooning events==
In 1937, Al Mingalone, an American photographer for Paramount News previously used 32 weather balloons for a feature photography assignment at Old Orchard Beach in Maine. While he hung suspended from the balloons by a parachute harness in order to take aerial film footage, Mingalone&#x27;s mooring rope broke and he was lifted approximately into the air. A clergyman, Father James J. Mullen, spotted the incident, and after a chase of some , used a .22-caliber rifle to shoot out two of the balloons, thus allowing the photographer to return safely to the ground.

Walters&#x27;s flight spawned imitators, and allegedly inspired the extreme sport of cluster ballooning.
* On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1984, in Stow, Massachusetts, Kevin Walsh made a flight to with 57 helium balloons and descended by parachute. He was cited with four violations of FAA regulations and fined $4,000.
* On July 7, 2007, Kent Couch, a 47-year-old American gas station owner from Bend, Oregon, reportedly flew in his lawn chair, landing in a field about NNW of North Powder, Oregon, about from the Idaho border. Traveling an average of , Couch used plastic bags filled with of water as ballast against the 105 large helium balloons tied to his lawn chair. Like Walters, Couch had a BB gun on hand to shoot the balloons in order to initiate descent. After the flight, he developed a way to release helium from the balloons, allowing for a more controlled descent. During a second flight on July 5, 2008, Couch realized his goal of interstate travel when he landed safely in western Idaho. The trip totaled and took 9 hours and 12 minutes.
* On January 13, 2008, the Brazilian Roman Catholic priest and human-rights defender Adelir Antônio de Carli lifted off from Ampére, Brazil, suspended under 600 helium-filled party balloons, and reached an altitude of before landing safely in Argentina. On April 20, 2008, lifting off from Paranaguá, Brazil, in an attempt to fly 725 km (450 mi) inland to Dourados, Brazil, he flew using a chair suspended under 1,000 party balloons, reaching an altitude of . Not having checked the weather forecast, he got caught in a storm. He had a GPS but did not know how to operate it. He was last heard on the radio eight hours after liftoff approaching the water after flying off the coast, unable to give his position, and crashed in the Atlantic Ocean; the lower half of his body was found by the Brazilian Navy near an offshore oil platform on July 4, 2008. 
* On May 28, 2010, the American adventurer Jonathan Trappe crossed the English Channel by cluster balloon, departing near Challock, England, and crossing over the White Cliffs of Dover at St. Margarets Bay. He made landfall again over Dunkirk, France, and then tracked inland, landing in a farmer&#x27;s cabbage patch in France. Trappe continued to experiment in cluster ballooning flights. In 2011, he replicated the floating house from the animated film &quot;Up&quot; for a National Geographic television program. 
* On July 6, 2015, Daniel Boria of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, tied about 100 helium balloons to a garden chair and flew over his city in a publicity stunt. He escaped his balloon pod by cutting himself loose and deploying his parachute.
* On October 20, 2017, Tom Morgan of Bristol, England, reached heights of 8,000 ft (2,438 m) using 100 color helium balloons and has flown 25 km (15.5 miles) over South Africa.
* On September 2, 2020, David Blaine reached via helium-filled balloons, suspended by harness attached to a cable routed through his sleeve to appear as if holding the balloons by one hand. He had all necessary licenses and permissions, carried an oxygen supply, ADS-B transponder, and remote control of ballast and balloon-popping squibs. He released himself from the balloons and free-fell until his parachute automatically opened at . The balloon was then remotely piloted by the ground team to a safe landing.

== In popular culture ==
The song &quot;Walters&quot; by the American band Pinback from their 2007 album &quot;Autumn of the Seraphs&quot; is about the event and Walters&#x27;s life after it.

A comedy musical based on the events debuted at The Lowry in Salford, UK in April 2024.

2003 Australian comedy film &quot;Danny Deckchair&quot; was inspired by Walters’s story. A documentary called &quot;Larry’s Lawnchair&quot; is in production as of 2024 by filmmaker Nirvan Mullick, using long-lost footage from Walters’s flight.

The 2003 episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;The Miseducation of Bobby Hill&quot;, features a subplot in which Bill Dauterive attempts to fly on a lawnchair with weather balloons attached to it, only to be swept away and become lost for several days, inspired by Walters&#x27; story.

<doc id="340934" wikidata="Q53710" url="?curid=340934" title="Long March 2F">
<text>The Long March 2F ( &quot;Changzheng 2F&quot;), also known as the CZ-2F, LM-2F and Shenjian (, &quot;Divine Arrow&quot;), is a Chinese orbital carrier rocket, part of the Long March 2 rocket family. Designed to launch crewed Shenzhou spacecraft, the Long March 2F is a human-rated two-stage version of the Long March 2E rocket, which in turn was based on the Long March 2C launch vehicle. It is launched from complex SLS at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The Long March 2F made its maiden flight on 19 November 1999, with the Shenzhou 1 spacecraft. After the flight of Shenzhou 3, CPC General Secretary and President Jiang Zemin named the rocket &quot;Shenjian&quot;, meaning &quot;Divine Arrow&quot;.

On 29 December 2002, a Long March 2F launched Shenzhou 4 for a final uncrewed test of the Shenzhou spacecraft for the upcoming flight of the first crewed mission. Until then, all missions were uncrewed.

On 15 October 2003, a Long March 2F launched Shenzhou 5, China&#x27;s maiden crewed mission and achieved its first human spaceflight. Since then, the rocket has launched nineteen more missions into orbit with the latest being the Shenzhou 19 spacecraft.

== Differences from the Long March 2E ==
Externally, the rocket is similar to the Long March 2E from which it was derived. Most of the changes involve the addition of redundant systems to improve safety, although there are some structural modifications that allow the rocket to support the heavier fairing required by the Shenzhou capsule. The rocket is also capable of lifting heavier payloads with the addition of extra boosters to the first stage.

The rocket also has an &quot;advanced fault monitoring and diagnosis system to help the astronauts escape in time of emergency&quot; (in other words, a launch escape system), and is the first Chinese made rocket to be assembled and rolled out to its launch site vertically.
==Derivatives==
A derivative called Long March 2F/G, first launched in 2011, was made to replace the existing 2F variant. For uncrewed launches, Long March 2F/T was designed, which launched space laboratories such as Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2. It dispenses with the launch escape system and supports a larger fairing to accommodate the bulkier payloads. For launching payloads like reusable experimental spacecraft, the Long March 2F/G&#x27;s fairing has bumps added to enclose parts of the payload (such as wingtips) without using a larger fairing. 

== Vibration issues ==
During the Shenzhou 5 flight, Yang Liwei became unwell due to heavy vibrations from the rocket. Although the problem was reduced somewhat by modifications to the rocket, vibrations were reported again in Shenzhou 6 necessitating further changes. According to Jing Muchun, chief designer of the Long March 2F &quot;We made changes to the pipelines of the rocket engine, adjusting its frequency. A new design for the pressure accumulator produced evident results. The vibration has now been reduced by more than 50%&quot;. During the launch preparations for the Shenzhou 14 mission chief designer Gao Xu said incremental improvements made to the rocket&#x27;s design mean vibrations felt by the taikonauts would be similar to that felt in a car driven on a highway.

The predecessor Long March 2E had also been known for vibration. During two launches, excessive vibration caused the collapse of the payload fairing, destroying the Optus B2 and Apstar 2 satellites. After the payload fairing was redesigned, excessive vibration also damaged the AsiaSat 2 satellite during launch. After its successful launch of the Echostar 1 satellite on 28 December 1995 the rocket was officially retired from service.

<text>Aristagoras of Miletus (), d. 497/496 BC, was the tyrant of the Ionian city of Miletus in the late 6th century BC and early 5th century BC. He acted as one of the instigators of the Ionian Revolt against the Persian Achaemenid Empire. He was the son-in-law of Histiaeus and was granted the tyranny of Miletus from him.

The Greeks had won the coast of Asia Minor from the preceding Hittite Empire during the Bronze Age, and thanks to their victory at Troy had kept it during the fall of the empire and retirement of the Hittites to Syria. They shared the coast with the Phrygians (proto-Armenians) coming in from the Balkans, but neither were prepared for the armed invasion of their lands by the Persians during the late 6th-century BC. The Ionian Greeks appealed to the mainland Greeks for assistance and not receiving it were forced to capitulate, becoming subjects of the new Achaemenid Empire. However, as long as they paid their taxes and were no threat to the rule of the Persians, the latter were willing to allow them self-rule under the Greek tyrants. The entire region, however, including those tyrants, held a smoldering resentment against the Persian Empire.

Aristagoras is of historical note for his instigation of the Ionian revolt in collaboration with his father-in-law and predecessor, Histiaeus. The conspiracy gained the support of many Greek Ionian states but failed to win the full support of the mainland Greek states. Consequently, the Persians came down upon the Ionian Greeks in overwhelming numbers, sacking the rebel cities, including Miletus. At Miletus, the Persians killed all the warriors, castrated the young men, and sold the women and children into slavery. It was their intent that Miletus would never again be repopulated, and for some decades it was not.

Aristagoras, prior to the sacking of Miletus, had led a contingent of colonists to Thrace. Due to this action, he is the only general Herodotus labels as a coward. Despite advice not to do so, Aristagoras took up occupation of the city of Myrcinus. He would then lay siege to another Thracian city, where he and all his men would be killed in combat. The first Persian invasion of mainland Greece would occur two years after the defeat of the Ionians. In 492 BC the Persian king Darius would order a naval attack in retaliation against Athens and Eretria for supporting the Greeks in the Ionian Revolt.

==Background==

By the time extant history hears of him, Aristagoras was already serving as deputy governor of Miletus, a polis on the western coast of Anatolia around 500 BC. He was the son of Molpagoras, a previous tyrant of an independent Miletus. As well as the son-in-law of Histiaeus, whom the Persians had set up as tyrant but did not trust. After general Megabazus presented his complaints about Histiaeus to Darius I of Persia, the latter summoned Histiaeus to his court and detained him at Susa, the reason given was that he wanted a trustworthy advisor. On the recommendation of Histiaeus, the Achaemenids then appointed Aristagoras as the new ruler of Miletus. Aristagoras ruled Miletus while Histiaeus remained in Susa, kept under observation away from his troops.
Aristagoras was the main driver of the Ionian Revolt on secret instruction from Histiaeus, when the latter learned of Persian plans to interfere directly in Miletus. Aristagoras took advantage of Greek dissatisfaction with Persian rule to incite an alliance of the Greek poleis of Ionia. 

==Failure of the Naxos expedition==
Certain exiled citizens of Naxos came to Miletus to seek refuge. They asked Aristagoras to supply them with troops, so that they could regain control of their homeland. Aristagoras considered that if he was able to supply troops to the Naxians, then he could become ruler of Naxos. So he agreed to assist the Naxians. He explained that he did not have enough troops of his own, but that Artaphernes, Darius&#x27; brother and the Persian satrap of Lydia, who commanded a large army and navy on the coast of Asia, could help supply troops. The Naxians agreed to Aristagoras seeking Artaphernes&#x27; support and supplied him with money.

Aristagoras travelled to Sardis and suggested that Artaphernes attack Naxos and restore the exiles. The Persians would then gain control of the island. He explained to Artaphernes that Naxos “was a fine and fertile island, close to the Ionian coast, and rich both in treasures and slaves.” It was also the gateway to the Cyclades, which the Persians did not yet rule. Aristagoras promised that he would both fund the expedition and give Artaphernes a bonus sum. He also tempted Artaphernes by adding that capturing the island would place other poleis of the Cyclades under his control. They would serve as bases for an invasion of Euboea. After securing the permission of Susa, Artaphernes agreed and promised 200 ships.

The following spring, Aristagoras and the Naxian exiles sailed with the fleet. Unfortunately for the success of the invasion, Aristagoras quarreled with the Persian admiral Megabates. He interfered in Magabates&#x27; role in disciplining the ship captains to save a friend from harsh punishment for an infraction (failure to set a watch on his ship). Aristagoras saved his friend from punishment but lost the support of the Persian admiral, who expected to be in overall command. The schism was irreparable with Megabates deciding to sabotage the entire operation by secretly informing the Naxians that they were about to be attacked, taking away the element of surprise. Naxos then had enough time to prepare for a siege. Four months later, the siege still held, the Persians were out of supplies and had only limited funds remaining. The expedition was then considered a failure and the Persians sailed home.

==Ionian Revolt==
Due to his failure to make good on his Naxian promises, Aristagoras&#x27; political position was at risk. He began to plan a revolt with the Milesians and the other Ionians. Meanwhile, Histiaeus, still detained at Susa, had tattooed a message upon the shaved head of a slave. Once his hair had grown back, he sent him to Aristagoras. The message told Aristagoras to revolt. Histiaeus, desperate to resume his authority at Miletus, hoped Darius would send him to deal with a Milesian revolt.

Both leaders being of the same mind, Aristagoras conferred with a council of his supporters, who agreed to a rebellion in Miletus in 499 BC. Aristagoras was supported by most of the citizens in council, except the historian Hecataeus. Hecataeus voted against the revolt because he believed that the Ionians would be out-matched with defeat being inevitable. Once the vote was taken, however, there is no evidence that he excluded himself from the revolt. In fact, he had suggestions to make. Once the war began, the Ionians expected all to participate, although they could not stop the larger allies from withdrawing. 

As soon as the vote for war was certain, Aristagoras took steps to secure the nearby Persian ships. The Naxos fleet was recovering from its ordeal at Myus. Now in a position of command, Herodotus is not specific, Aristagoras sent a party under Iatragoras to arrest the admirals still with the fleet, some several men. Ironically, these were mainly Greek. They were later released and sent home. Now that the rebellion was in the open, Aristagoras “set himself to damage Darius in every way he could think of”.

The scope of the revolt spread rapidly to all Ionia. Aristagoras foresaw that one city against the Persians would soon be crushed. He therefore set about creating an alliance of all the Ionian cities, but the members also came from regions beyond Ionia. He made a number of constitutional changes, not all of which are clear. First he relinquished his own tyranny. Approaching the other states, he convinced them to end theirs. Finally he ordered all of the states to create a board of generals to report, apparently, to him. When his government was in place he sailed to Lacedaemon and other states of Greece in search of allies.

There has been some question as to the exact meaning of Herodotus&#x27; governmental terms, and as to the form of government of the Ionian alliance. The most fundamental question is where Aristagoras got his authority over the Ionians in the first place. They were all under the satrapy of Lydia, not under Miletus. The satrap was Persian. The tyrant of Miletus was appointed by the satrap, but he also appointed all the other tyrants. For reasons not specified in Herodotus, Miletus took the lead.

One can only assume a leadership role of some kind of Aristagoras over the other tyrants, whether personal or according to some unspecified convention. In order to gain the participation of the people in the revolt, it was said that Aristagoras &quot;let go&quot; the tyranny and established isonomia, which translates roughly as &quot;equality of government.&quot; According to Liddell and Scott, a standard dictionary of ancient Greek, Thucydides used it to mean the &quot;equality of rights&quot; in a democracy.

Aristagoras went on to &quot;put a stop to tyranny&quot; in all the other Ionian cities, and moreover to insist that they select boards of generals reporting to him. No voting is mentioned. Apparently a new sovereign entity had been formed with Aristagoras at its head. The state had the power to levy taxes and troops. Aristagoras was commander of the joint armed forces. Miletus was to be the new capital. The newly sovereign Ionia issued its own coinage between 499 and its destruction by the Persians in 494.

==Spartan refusal to provide assistance==

In 499 BCE. Aristagoras appealed to the Spartan king, Cleomenes I, for military aid in his revolt. He praised the quality of the Spartan warriors and argued that a pre-emptive invasion of Persia would be easy. To illustrate his view, he had brought along a &quot;bronze tablet on which a map of all the earth was engraved, and all the sea, and all the rivers.&quot; No more information is given about the map, but some scholars have argued that Aristagoras borrowed the map from Hecataeus of Miletus, or Anaximander of Miletus.

Aristagoras claimed that the Persians would be easy to defeat, as they fought in &quot;trousers and turbans&quot;. He also tempted the Spartan king with Persian riches. Cleomenes asked Aristagoras to wait two days for an answer. When they next met, Cleomenes asked how long it would take to reach Susa, and upon learning that it was a three months’ journey, he firmly refused Spartan assistance as his troops would be gone for too long. At the time, Sparta was concerned over possible attacks from the Argives. The Greek historian Herodotus claimed that Aristagoras attempted to change Cleomenes’ mind with bribes, until the king&#x27;s young daughter Gorgo warned that Aristagoras would corrupt him. Aristagoras left without the requested assistance.

==Defeat of the Athenians==
Aristagoras next went to Athens, where he made a convincing speech, promising &quot;everything that came into his head, until at last he succeeded&quot;. Won over, the Athenians agreed to send ships to Ionia and Aristagoras went before them. The Athenians subsequently arrived in Miletus with twenty triremes and five others belonging to the Eretrians. Herodotus described the arrival of these ships as the beginning of troubles between the Greeks and the barbarians. Once all his allies had arrived, Aristagoras put his brother Charopinus and another Milesian, Hermophantus, in charge of the expedition, and the whole contingent set out for the provincial capital, Sardis, while Aristagoras remained to govern from Miletus.

The first leg of the journey was to proceed along the coast to Ephesus. Using it as base, they went overland to Sardis, on which they descended on the city taking its defenders by surprise. The satrap Artaphernes and his forces retreated to the acropolis immediately. A fire, started allegedly by accident in the town, burned down the temple of the Lydian goddess Cybebe (Cybele). Attributing the fire to Ionian maliciousness, the Persians later used it as an excuse for burning Greek temples.

The fire forced the defenders of the acropolis to abandon it in favor of the marketplace. Its defense coincided fortuitously with the arrival of Persian reinforcements. Interpreting the tumult as a counter-attack, the Ionians retreated to Tmolus, a nearby hill, from which they escaped by night. The reinforcements followed the Ionians, caught up with them near Ephesus and soundly defeated them.

The Persians had conquered Lydia, including all the Greek cities located in that state. They made such a show of mercy as to win the hearts and minds of the Anatolians, as well as of some of the Greeks. A call for assistance went rapidly around the satrapy. Joint Persian-Anatolian forces hastened overnight to the assistance of the satrap.

They arrived with such short notice and major fanfare as to frighten away the Ionian-Athenian forces. The Cambridge Ancient History article attributes this swift arrival to the Persian cavalry, which also had no trouble tracking and catching the Ionians before the gates of Ephesus. The losses of the mainland Greeks were so great that they sought to return home, leaving Aristagoras and the rebels to fend for themselves. An air of doom pervaded the revolt, but they fought with such spirit that the rebellion spilled over into the nearby Greek islands.

After this battle, the Athenians refused to continue to fight in the Ionian Revolt and returned to Athens. However, because of Athenians&#x27; participation in the revolt, the Persian king, Darius, swore vengeance on Athens and commanded a servant to repeat to him three times every day at dinner, “Master, remember the Athenians”. This may only be a story (but not necessarily on that account false), as the Persians intended expansion into the Balkans all along. They still held parts of Thrace from their previous abortive expedition into Scythia, only stopped when they learned the true size of the country (most of southern Russia) and the danger of their position in it.

The Ionians fought on, gaining control of Byzantium and the surrounding towns as well as the greater part of Caria. They were not, however, alone. In this last phase of the conflict, almost all of Cyprus also rebelled against the Persians. Onesilus, the younger brother of Gorgus, the ruler of Salamis, tried to convince his brother to rebel against Persia and join in the Ionian Revolt. When his brother refused to support the revolt, Onesilus waited until he left Salamis and then shut the city gates on him. Gorgus fled to the Persians while Onesilus took over and convinced the Cyprians to revolt. They then proceeded to lay siege to the city of Amathus.

==Aftermath==
Well before the revolt collapsed, Aristagoras began looking for a shelter to which he could execute a strategic retreat. He and his men resolved on Myrcinus in Thrace, which had been an Ionian stronghold in the abortive Persian invasion of Scythia. He put Pythagoras, &quot;a man of distinction&quot;, in charge of Miletus and set sail for Thrace, where he attempted to establish a colony on the Strymon river, at the same site as the later Athenian colony of Amphipolis.

The Thracians, not now disposed to tolerate any further presence of Greeks in their country, opposed this incursion. He gained control of the territory but later, while besieging a neighboring town, Aristagoras was killed in battle.

Expecting a swift Persian victory, Aristagoras had hoped to establish a redoubt of Ionians, who would come to the assistance of Miletus at a later time. By an accidental sequence of historical events his reputation drew the ire of his main historian, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, an Ionian partisan, to such a degree that it suffers yet. Although a champion of freedom, Aristagoras is the only man in all his &quot;Histories&quot; that Herodotus openly calls a coward, blaming his supposed flight for the defeat of the revolt. The revolt apparently intensified and spread into the islands. Aristagoras had no way of knowing that he would have been in the van of it, or that the Thracians would not allow a redoubt.

In the last months of the failing revolt, the Persians were reconquering the rebel Ionians city by city. When all was nearly lost, the Persian king Darius was convinced by Histiaeus that he could settle the conflict and now should be sent back to Miletus.

Histiaeus never succeeded in reaching Miletus. Reporting first to Sardis, whether with or without the Great King&#x27;s complicity (Herodotus does not say), he was interrogated concerning his true loyalties. Histiaeus swore complete ignorance of the events of the revolt and unquestionable loyalty to the Persians. He admitted nothing, but the satrap, Artaphernes, was not in the least deceived. He said, &quot;I will tell thee how the case stands, Histaeus: this shoe is of thy stitching; Aristagoras has but put it on.&quot;

Recognizing that he risked arrest or worse at the hands of Artaphernes, Histiaeus escaped that night and took ship at the coast, probably at Ephesus. He had no trouble raising troops and finding ships, but he found that he was not trusted by the Ionians. Miletus would not have him back. He became a mercenary in the Aegean until he was hunted down and executed by Artaphernes. The Ionian Revolt finally ended in 494/493 BC. The Persians went on to prepare for the conquest of Greece under the pretext of a punitive campaign against Athens.

Due to the disparity in resources and the reluctance of the mainland Greek states to involve themselves, the Ionian Revolt failed and Persia regained control over the Ionian Greeks. After only one year, the Cyprians were once again forced into submission by Persia. The cities around the Hellespont fell one after another to Daurises, the son-in-law of king Darius. The Carians fought the Persians at the Meander River and were defeated with severe casualties. Cyprus was recaptured by Persian and Phoenician forces.

The revolt was over by 494/493 BC. Aiming directly for Miletus in 494 BC, the Persians defeated the Ionians in the naval Battle of Lade, an island off Miletus. The city was then subject to a siege and the war lost at its fall. Although there was some mild destruction of rebel cities (except for Miletus, which was razed and the population decimated and transported), the Persians were interested in ruling rather than revenge. They began to plan for the invasion of Greece which was to start in 490 BC in a series of conflicts which are now known as the Greco-Persian Wars.

==Herodotus as a source==
Most of the information on Aristagoras and his actions comes from the writings of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus. On the one hand he is virtually the only literary source for the events he presents as history. While in many ways he reflects some of the best of ancient historiography, on the other hand, his work is sprinkled with motivational and logical lacunae, creating textual paradoxes everywhere, causing some scholars to be critical of his value as a historical source, especially regarding the Ionian Revolt. Views amongst historians on Herodotus&#x27; work can be split into two camps: the skeptical, discrediting Herodotus as an unreliable source, and the affirmative, who credit him with being reliable in many matters albeit with particular biases understandable at the time he wrote.

===The skeptical view===
Manville had a skeptical view concerning an imaginary power struggle between Aristagoras and Histiaeus isolated from the usual contexts of war and society. Manville has no confidence in Herodotus&#x27; ability to relate connected history and therefore supplies connections for him out of his own speculations. He was preceded in this method by the earlier work of Mabel Lang. A 1968 article by Lang focuses on the paradoxes of the Ionian revolt. For example, Histiaeus originally won the Great King&#x27;s favor by protecting his escape from Scythia over a key bridge of the Danube. Despite this vital rescue to save the king and all his forces, he shortly after plots a rebellion.

Lang suggests that one might conclude to an ulterior motive at the bridge, &quot;to ingratiate himself with Darius so that he could be on the inside of the king&#x27;s policy&quot;. Apparently, to be on the inside of his policy he has to save his life and the lives of all his army by letting him escape from the large Scythian army not far behind. He prefers to keep him alive for nothing more serious than keeping an eye on him. Nonchalantly Lang writes: &quot;Presumably revolt was already in the air...&quot; It could not have been far in the air if Histiaeus passed up a chance for total victory at the outset, a prized goal of many a lightning campaign in world history afterwards.

The basic problem is Lang&#x27;s cynicism: &quot;we should not hope to discover the truth about the result merely by accepting the narrative ...&quot; Accordingly, she rehearses a catalogue of paradoxes similar to Manville&#x27;s weaving her own fantasy of unattested events to contain it. Her explanation of why such a tale is necessary is similarly speculative: &quot;the failure of the revolt not only gave prominence to every aspect and event which would explain, justify or anticipate the disastrous results but also cast into the shade any intentions which deserved a better fate and any temporary successes during the course of the war&quot;. Not having any other account with which to compare these events, she cannot possibly know that.

===The affirmative view===
The cynical view described above reflects a difference in expectation between Herodotus and his target audiences, which by the accidents of time are multiple and various. He did not write for us moderns. Reading that he was the first historian whose work survived in anything more than scattered fragments, we expect him to have the proper concern of modern historians for continuity and causality, which other ancient historians, such as Thucydides, have. Herodotus is not one of those. With regard to causation, the Cambridge Ancient History article asserts: “...Herodotus does not seem to have innovated: he merely accepted the causation appropriate to his subject and period.”

It would be convenient to attribute this unconcern to a sort of intermediate phase between mythology and history, as many do. Such a view is neglectful of the ravages of time. Herodotus was not the first historian in any way, only the first whose work survived. He wrote of the Ionian Revolt a full generation after it happened; moreover, he was not a participant. He relied on the work of several previous historians at Miletus, of which fragments and mention have survived, chief of which was Hecataeus of Miletus.

Herodotus apparently designed his work according to a specific plan and style. Whether the previous historians used it is not known, due to the paucity of evidence, but it seems unlikely. He appears to use Hecataeus as a framework for his historical events. The fragments of Hecataeus suggest that he wrote only an annal-like sequence long on names and events but short on connecting narrative. To this framework Herodotus adds the logoi, or independent anecdotes of persons and events derived from independent oral traditions, which Herodotus obtained by interview with record-keepers and state historians. The disconnectedness comes from their being independent. It is pointless, therefore, to try to invent connections.

The ancient historians have therefore invented a special category for Herodotus, that he was a logographer, or teller of logoi, based on his own characterization of his sources as logopoeic, &quot;story makers&quot;. Usually the logographers include Hecataeus and the other historians of his generation, who lived through the revolt. There is little evidence of their logography. Whether Herodotus stands alone or is part of a Milesian tradition is a matter of speculation.

Validation of Herodotus therefore rests on validation of his logoi. There is no general validation, but the much-desired archaeological and inscriptional evidence appears to validate a few events as far as they go: some names, circumstances of war, and similar peripheral facts. He cannot be validated as a modern historian, but he does have an overall design, which is “Biblical” or &quot;Bible-like&quot; in scope. He is trying to do an epic in prose similar to the Homerica in verse. His topic is not the Trojan War, but the Graeco-Persian Wars. (The Homerica have been called the pagan Greek &quot;Bible&quot;.) Says Oswyn Murray in the Cambridge Ancient History, 
It is certainly hard to find fault with his general view that the only adequate explanation for the Persian Wars must be a complete account of relations between the two peoples since the conquest of the Ionian cities in 545 B.C.

In short, Herodotus is personal because the Homerica are personal. Both genres intend to portray the illustrious or non-illustrious deeds and doings of persons in the contexts of mighty wars. Thus Aristagoras personally can be called a “coward.” The lying that they do is metis, &quot;cunning,&quot; an admired Greek virtue practiced by the greatest hero of them all, the crafty Odysseus. The literary tradition of it went on. Virgil could include the half-line Timeo Graecos dona ferentes, &quot;I fear Greeks bearing Gifts,&quot; in the Aeneid.

The expectation of modernity in Herodotus is misplaced. Validation must be sought for individual logoi. The whole work or any part of it cannot logically be condemned on the basis of one or a group of paradoxes. All skepticism must have a reason for doubting. The inconsistencies of Herodotus are not a valid reason, which is generally true. But few stories are ever free of inconsistency, and if they are, they are suspect on that account (&quot;too good to be true&quot;).

Denials of Herodotus&#x27; validity, from mild to severe, although widespread, were never universal. As an example of ancient information generally agreed to be invalid, many works attributed to various authors have been placed in the &quot;pseudo-&quot; category after as much as centuries of review. There was never any such universal and long-standing denial of Herodotus. On the contrary, the main events, such as the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, have been accepted as basically credible by many scholars of many ages. It is therefore misplaced to speak of the &quot;rehabilitation&quot; of Herodotus in medical or neo-ideologic terms.

Accordingly, the most sanguine view treats his work as though no problems exist regarding it. Referring to the Cambridge Ancient History article on the Ionian Revolt by Murray, Georges addresses &quot;the question of Herodotus&#x27; veracity and reliability.&quot; Repeating Murray&#x27;s criticism that &quot;the traditions concerning the revolt itself are ... fragmented into individual episodes of folly, treachery, or heroism&quot; and therefore are not &quot;trustworthy materials for the history of the revolt,&quot; he asserts to the contrary that &quot;Herodotus&#x27; account furnishes the material for a coherent and credible account of the actions and events it presents...&quot;

Having said this, Georges must now show that, rather than being paradoxical, Herodotus is coherent and credible. Like Lang, having no other account to offer, he must make his demonstrations from the text of Herodotus, which he spends the rest of the article doing, disputing most of Murray&#x27;s interpretations. The contradictions are not to be viewed as contradictions. He does not address the question of why, if they are not so, it is necessary to spend an article in disputation over them. The result is a new set of speculations fully as imaginary as Murray&#x27;s, not being based on any alternative texts.

There is hope, however, as fragments of Greek texts and inscriptions continue to be discovered. Meanwhile, it seems common knowledge that the public of any age is not going to relinquish credibility in Herodotus&#x27; great depiction of the Persian Wars.

<text>Ficus macrophylla, commonly known as the Moreton Bay fig or Australian banyan, is a large evergreen banyan tree of the Mulberry Family (Moraceae) native to eastern Australia, from the Wide Bay–Burnett region in the north to the Illawarra in New South Wales, as well as Lord Howe Island where the subspecies &quot;F. m. columnaris&quot; is a banyan form covering 2.5 acres (a hectare) or more of ground. Its common name is derived from Moreton Bay in Queensland, Australia. It is best known for its imposing buttress roots.

&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; is called a strangler fig because seed germination usually takes place in the canopy of a host tree, where the seedling lives as an epiphyte until its roots establish contact with the ground, when it enlarges and strangles its host, eventually becoming a freestanding tree by itself. Individuals may reach in height, with crown spreads as great as 250 feet (76 metres) being reported. The greatest exact height to be reported is 232 feet (70.6 meters). It has an obligate mutualism with fig wasps; figs are pollinated only by fig wasps, and fig wasps can reproduce only in fig flowers. The wasp partner of the Moreton Bay Fig is &quot;Pleistodontes froggattii&quot;. Many species of birds, including pigeons, parrots, and various passerines, eat the fruit.

&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; is widely used as a feature tree in public parks and gardens in warmer climates such as California, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Malta, northern New Zealand (Auckland), and Australia. Old specimens can reach tremendous size, and their aggressive root system renders them unsuitable for all but the largest private gardens.

==Description==

&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; is an evergreen tree that can reach heights of . The trunk can be massive, with thick, prominent buttressing, and reach a diameter of . The rough bark is grey-brown, and marked with various blemishes. The Lord Howe form of Moreton Bay fig has a habit of dropping aerial roots from its branches, which upon reaching the ground, thicken into supplementary trunks which help to support the weight of its crown. The largest specimen of the Lord Howe Island subspecies, around the year 1900, covered seven acres (2.8 hectares) of ground. The largest specimen of the mainland subspecies reported in a credible source was one reported by forester C.E. Pemberton which was 232 feet (70.6 metres) in height and 101 feet (30.4 metres) to the first branch.

The leaves and branches bleed a milky sap if cut or broken. The figs are in diameter, turning from green to purple with lighter spots as they ripen; ripe fruit may be found year-round, although they are more abundant from February to May. It is a rainforest plant and in this environment more often grows in the form of an epiphytic strangler vine than that of a tree. When its seeds land in the branch of a host tree it sends aerial, &quot;strangler&quot; roots down the host trunk, eventually killing the host and standing alone. It is monoecious: each tree bears functional male and female flowers. As indicated by its specific epithet, it has large, elliptic, leathery, dark green leaves, long, and they are arranged alternately on the stems. The fruit is known as a syconium, an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity.

==Taxonomy==
South African botanist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon published a formal description of the Moreton Bay fig in his 1807 work &quot;Synopsis Plantarum&quot;, the material having been reported by French botanist René Louiche Desfontaines in 1804. The type specimen has been lost but was possibly located in Florence. The specific epithet &quot;macrophylla&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;makros&quot; &quot;large&quot; and &quot;phyllon&quot; &quot;leaf&quot;, and refers to the size of the leaves. In the early 19th century, Italian botanist Vincenzo Tineo of the Orto botanico di Palermo in Sicily obtained a plant from a French nursery that grew to a prodigious size with a banyan habit. This form was propagated and grown in gardens around Sicily. A later director of the gardens, Antonino Borzì, described it as &quot;Ficus magnolioides&quot; in 1897, distinguishing it from &quot;F. macrophylla&quot; on account of its larger leaves with greener undersides. This name was widely used in Europe.

Australian botanist Charles Moore described &quot;Ficus columnaris&quot; in 1870 from material collected from Lord Howe Island, choosing the species name from the Latin &quot;columnaris&quot; for the column-like roots. English botanist E. J. H. Corner reduced this to synonymy with &quot;F. macrophylla&quot; in 1965, before P. S. Green noted it was distinct enough for subspecies status in 1986. Australian botanist Dale J. Dixon reviewed material and felt the differences too minor to warrant subspecific status, and recognised two forms: &quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; f. &quot;macrophylla&quot;, a free-standing tree endemic to mainland Australia; and &quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; f. &quot;columnaris&quot;, a hemiepiphyte lacking a distinct main trunk and endemic to Lord Howe Island. Review of &quot;F. magnolioides&quot; by Silvio Fici and Francesco Maria Raimondo found that it was &quot;F. macrophylla&quot; f. &quot;columnaris&quot;.

The species is commonly known as the Moreton Bay fig, after Moreton Bay in southern Queensland, although it is found elsewhere. An alternate name—black fig—is derived from the dark colour of the ageing bark.

With over 750 species, &quot;Ficus&quot; is one of the largest angiosperm genera. Based on morphology, Corner divided the genus into four subgenera; later expanded to six. In this classification, the Moreton Bay fig was placed in subseries &quot;Malvanthereae&quot;, series &quot;Malvanthereae&quot;, section &quot;Malvanthera&quot; of the subgenus &quot;Urostigma&quot;. In his reclassification of the Australian &quot;Malvanthera&quot;, Dixon altered the delimitations of the series within the section but left this species in series &quot;Malvanthereae&quot;.

In 2005, Dutch botanist Cornelis Berg completed Corner&#x27;s treatment of the Moraceae for the &quot;Flora Malesiana&quot;; the completion of that work had been delayed since 1972 as a result of disagreements between Corner and C. J. J. G. van Steenis, editor of the &quot;Flora Malesiana&quot;. Berg combined sections &quot;Stilpnophyllum&quot; and &quot;Malvanthera&quot; into an expanded section &quot;Stilpnophyllum&quot;. This left the Moreton Bay fig in subsection &quot;Malvanthera&quot;, section &quot;Stilpnophyllum&quot;.

In a 2008 study on DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers, Danish botanist Nina Rønsted and colleagues rejected previous subdivisions of the &quot;Malvanthera&quot;. Instead, they divided section &quot;Malvanthera&quot; into three subsections—&quot;Malvantherae&quot;, &quot;Platypodeae,&quot; and &quot;Hesperidiiformes&quot;. In this system, the Moreton Bay fig is in the subsection &quot;Malvantherae&quot;, along with &quot;F. pleurocarpa&quot;. The &quot;Malvantherae&quot; appear to be basal (an early offshoot) to the group. &quot;F. macrophylla&quot; form &quot;macrophylla&quot; is native to mainland Australia, while form &quot;columnaris&quot; of &quot;macrophylla&quot; colonised Lord Howe Island. The section &quot;Malvanthera&quot; itself is thought to have evolved 41 million years ago and radiated around 35 million years ago.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Moreton Bay fig is a native of eastern coastal Australia, from the Wide Bay–Burnett region in central Queensland, to the Shoalhaven River on the New South Wales south coast. It is found in subtropical, warm temperate, and dry rainforest, where, as an emergent tree, its crown may tower above the canopy, particularly along watercourses on alluvial soils. In the Sydney region, &quot;F. macrophylla&quot; grows from sea level to 300 m (1000 ft) altitude, in areas with an average yearly rainfall of .

It often grows with trees such as white booyong (&quot;Argyrodendron trifoliolatum&quot;), &quot;Flindersia&quot; species, giant stinging tree (&quot;Dendrocnide excelsa&quot;), lacebark (&quot;Brachychiton discolor&quot;), red cedar (&quot;Toona ciliata&quot;), hoop pine (&quot;Araucaria cunninghamii&quot;), green-leaved fig (&quot;Ficus watkinsiana&quot;) and &quot;Cryptocarya obovata&quot;. The soils it grows on are high in nutrients and include Bumbo Latite and Budgong Sandstone. As rainforests were cleared, isolated specimens were left standing in fields as remnant trees, valued for their shade and shelter for livestock. One such tree was a landmark for and gave its name to the Wollongong suburb of Figtree in New South Wales.
==Ecology==

The huge numbers of fruit produced by the Moreton Bay fig make it a key source of food in the rainforest. It is an important food to the green catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus crassirostris&quot;), as well as fruit-eating pigeons such as the wompoo fruit-dove (&quot;Ptilinopus magnificus&quot;), and topknot pigeon (&quot;Lopholaimus antarcticus&quot;), and a sometime food of the rose-crowned fruit-dove (&quot;Ptilinopus regina&quot;). Other bird species that eat the fruit include the yellow-eyed cuckoo-shrike (&quot;Coracina lineata&quot;), pied currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;), Australasian figbird (&quot;Sphecotheres vieilloti&quot;), Regent bowerbird (&quot;Sericulus chrysocephalus&quot;), satin bowerbird (&quot;Ptilonorhynchus violaceus&quot;), and Lewin&#x27;s honeyeater (&quot;Meliphaga lewinii&quot;). Fruit bats such as the grey-headed flying-fox (&quot;Pteropus poliocephalus&quot;) also feed on the fruit. As well as the pollinating fig wasp, &quot;Pleistodontes froggatti&quot;, syconia of the Moreton Bay fig are host to several species of non-pollinating chalcidoid wasps including &quot;Sycoscapter australis&quot; (Pteromalidae), &quot;Eukobelea hallami&quot; (Sycophaginae), and &quot;Meselatus&quot; sp. (Epichrysomallinae). The nematode species &quot;Schistonchus macrophylla&quot; and &quot;Schistonchus altermacrophylla&quot; are found in the syconia, where they parasitise &quot;P. froggattii&quot;.

The thrips species &quot;Gynaikothrips australis&quot; feeds on the underside of new leaves of &quot;F. macrophylla&quot;, as well as those of &quot;F. rubiginosa&quot; and &quot;F. obliqua&quot;. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue and a gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding. The species pupates sheltered in the bark. The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander about in the daytime and return in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree.

Stressed trees can also be attacked by psyllids to the point of defoliation. Grubs hatch from eggs laid on the edges of leaves and burrow into the leaf to suck nutrients, the tree&#x27;s latex shielding the insect. Caterpillars of the moth species &quot;Lactura caminaea&quot; (Lacturidae) can strip trees of their leaves. The tree is also a host for the longhorn beetle (Cerambycidae) species &quot;Agrianome spinicollis&quot;. The fungal pathogen brown root rot (&quot;Phellinus noxius&quot;) has infected and killed this species.

===Reproduction and life span===

Figs have an obligate mutualism with fig wasps (Agaonidae); figs are pollinated only by fig wasps, and fig wasps can reproduce only in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species depends on a single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species to reproduce. The mainland and Lord Howe populations of the Moreton Bay fig are both pollinated by &quot;Pleistodontes froggatti&quot;.

As is the case with all figs, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence known as a syconium, with tiny flowers arising from the inner surface. &quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; is monoecious—both male and female flowers are found on the same plant, and, in fact, in the same fruit, although they mature at different times. Female wasps enter the syconium and lay eggs in the female flowers as they mature. These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate. The females of the new generation collect pollen from the male flowers, which have matured by this point, and leave to visit other syconia and repeat the process. A field study in Brisbane found that &quot;F. macrophylla&quot; trees often bore both male and female syconia at the same time—which could be beneficial for reproduction in small, isolated populations such as those on islands. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. &quot;F. macrophylla&quot; itself can endure cooler climates than other fig species. Moreton Bay fig trees live for over 100 years in the wild.

===Potentially invasive species===

&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; is commonly cultivated in Hawaii and northern New Zealand. In both places, it has now naturalised, having acquired its pollinating wasp (&quot;Pleistodontes froggatti&quot;). In Hawaii, the wasp was deliberately introduced in 1921, and in New Zealand it was first recorded in 1993, having arrived by long-distance dispersal from Australia. The arrival of the wasp led to prolific production of fruits containing many small seeds adapted for dispersal by birds. The Moreton Bay fig has been found growing on both native and introduced trees in New Zealand and Hawaii. The size and vigour of this fig in New Zealand, and its lack of natural enemies, as well as its immunity to possum browsing, indicate that it may be able to invade forest and other native plant communities. Occasional garden escapees have been recorded in Turkey.

==Cultivation==
The Moreton Bay fig has been widely used in public parks in frost-free areas, and was popular with early settlers of Australia. Around the beginning of the 20th century, the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, Joseph Maiden, advocated the planting of street trees, generally uniform rows of the one species. He recommended Moreton Bay figs be spaced at intervals—far enough to avoid crowding as the trees matured, but close enough so that their branches would eventually interlock. Specimens can reach massive proportions, and have thrived in drier climates; impressive specimen trees have been grown in the Waring Gardens in Deniliquin, and Hay. They can withstand light frosts and can cope with salt-laden spray in coastal situations, and their fruit is beneficial for urban wildlife. However, their huge size precludes use in all but the largest gardens, and their roots are highly invasive and can damage piping and disrupt footpaths and roadways; the vast quantities of crushed fruit can be messy on the ground.

Especially due to their tendency for root buttressing, they are frequently seen as bonsai, although they are much more suited to larger styles as their large leaves do not reduce much in size and their stems have long intervals (internodal spaces) between successive leaves. It can be used as an indoor plant in medium to brightly lit indoor spaces.

===Notable specimens===

Large specimens of Moreton Bay fig trees are found in many parks and properties throughout eastern and northeastern Australia. The Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney botanical gardens contain numerous specimens planted in the middle of the 19th century. These trees are up to tall. At Mount Keira, near Wollongong there is a Moreton Bay fig measured at tall. A notable tree in the Sydney suburb of Randwick, the 150-year-old &quot;Tree of Knowledge&quot;, was controversially cut down in 2016 to make way for the CBD and South East Light Rail. The thickest human-planted tree in Australia is a F. macrophylla in Western Australia which has a DBH (diameter at breast height) of 16 ft 8in (five meters). There are many large specimens in New Zealand. A Moreton Bay fig at Pahi on the Kaipara Harbour, Northland, was measured in 1984 as high and wide, and in 2011 had a girth of .


The Moreton Bay fig was introduced into cultivation into California in the United States in the 1870s, 13 specimens being classified as Exceptional Trees of Los Angeles in 1980. The tallest &quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; in North America is adjacent to San Diego&#x27;s Natural History Museum and was planted in 1914. By 1996 it stood high and across. The widest Moreton Bay fig in North America is Santa Barbara&#x27;s Moreton Bay Fig Tree. It was planted in 1876, reportedly by a young girl who was given a seedling by an Australian sailor. It measures across. The Aoyama Tree stands between the Japanese American National Museum and the Temporary Contemporary in downtown Los Angeles. It was planted by Buddhist Japanese Americans in the early 20th century.
Two South African specimens, in the Arderne Gardens in Claremont and the Pretoria Zoo respectively, have the widest and second-widest canopies of any single-stemmed trees in the country. The Pretoria specimen was planted before 1899, and was tall with a canopy width of by 2012. There is a notable specimen sprawling on steps at the Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra, Portugal. &quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; has been used in public spaces in Palermo in Sicily, with impressive specimens found in the Orto Botanico, the gardens of the Villa Garibaldi, Giardino Inglese, and in some squares.

== Uses ==
The soft light timber has a wavy texture and is used for cases. Aboriginal people traditionally use the fibres for fishing nets. The fruits are edible and taste like other fig varieties.

<text>Colorado School of Mines (Mines) is a public research university in Golden, Colorado, United States. Founded in 1874, the school offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering, science, and mathematics, with a focus on energy and the environment. While Mines does offer undergraduate minor programs in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, it only offers degree programs in STEM fields, with the exception of economics. In the fall 2024 semester, the school enrolled 8,058 students, including 6,204 undergraduate and 1,854 graduate students. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

Golden, Colorado, established in 1859 as Golden City, served as a supply center for miners and settlers in the area. In 1866, Bishop George M. Randall of Massachusetts arrived in the territory and, seeing a need for higher education facilities in the area, began planning for a university which would include a school of mines. In 1870, he opened the Jarvis Hall Collegiate School in the central building of the Colorado University Schools campus just south of the town of Golden, accompanied it with Matthews Hall divinity school in 1872, and in 1873 the School of Mines opened under the auspices of the Episcopal Church. In 1874 the School of Mines, supported by the territorial government since efforts began in 1870, was acquired by the territory and has been a state institution since 1876 when Colorado attained statehood. Tuition was originally free to residents of Colorado.

In 1878, Jarvis Hall&#x27;s main building and Matthews Hall were both destroyed by fires in the span of two days. The School of Mines building was the only structure of the complex left standing. Following the fires, the School of Mines enrollment grew, consisting of prospectors and mine owners. A school library was established with $250, and a gymnasium was built to support the growing student body. The school&#x27;s fight song, &quot;The Mining Engineer&quot;, the first two verses of which are still sung today, was established on campus by 1885.

Following the 1880s, the School of Mines transitioned to become a 4-year university, removing its assaying certificate program. Around this time, silver and blue began to be seen as the official school colors. In 1894, Engineering Hall was completed. As the oldest building on campus, Engineering Hall originally housed the physics and drafting departments, but now houses the Division of Economics and Business. The following year, the CSM Alumni Association was founded with members wearing the first instance of the school&#x27;s Reuleaux triangle symbol. In 1898, Florence Caldwell became the first female graduate of the School of Mines, earning a Civil Engineering Degree.

=== 20th century ===
At the turn of the century, the School of Mines officially changed its name to the Colorado School of Mines. This marked the start of a long period of investment into Mines. In 1905, Simon Guggenheim donated $80,000 for the construction of Guggenheim Hall, which serves as the school&#x27;s administration building. On nearby Mount Zion, student Herbert Everest designed a large M made out of rocks for his senior thesis, which was constructed by 20 faculty and 250 students. Also on Mt. Zion, the first experimental mine owned by the Colorado School of Mines was opened. Known as the School Tunnel, it served to train mining engineers until 1921, when the Edgar Mine was purchased and the original School Tunnel was abandoned.

In 1919, tensions between the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Denver resulted in Colorado Governor Oliver Shoup threatening intervention after students from Mines held DU students and local news reporter Bill Bliss hostage in Golden.

During World War II, Mines was one of 227 universities that participated in the Army Specialized Training Program by the War Department. The program focused on training students in practical engineering skills for military service.

=== 21st century ===

In August 2007, a new student recreation center was completed. In 2008, the school finished expanding its main computer center, the Center for Technology and Learning Media (CTLM). In May 2008 the school completed construction and installation of a new supercomputer nicknamed &quot;Ra&quot; in the CTLM managed by the Golden Energy Computing Organization (GECO), a partnership among the Colorado School of Mines, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Science Foundation. In 2014, CoorsTek granted a $27 million investment to the university, leading to the 2017 opening of the CoorsTek Center for Applied Science and Engineering, a multi-disciplinary building on campus dedicated to both academic and research activities.

Since 1964, the Colorado School of Mines has hosted the annual oil shale symposium, one of the most important international oil shale conferences. Although the series of symposia stopped after 1992, the tradition was restored in 2006.

== Campus ==
Colorado School of Mines is located to the southwest of Golden&#x27;s downtown, bordered by U.S. Route 6 and Clear Creek. The campus spans , and includes over a dozen academic and research buildings, indoor and outdoor athletic facilities, two student centers, a library, eight residential halls, and administration buildings. Additionally, the campus hosts a research building for the United States Geological Survey, housing the National Earthquake Information Center.

Colorado School of Mines also operates the free admission Mines Museum of Earth Science, which displays rock and mineral specimens collected from Colorado&#x27;s numerous mining districts, as well as around the world. Notable objects in the collection include one of the &quot;Goodwill&quot; Apollo 17 lunar samples and the Miss Colorado crown.

=== Labriola Innovation District ===
The Labriola Innovation District, composed of McNeil Hall, xWorks, and the Labriola Innovation Hub (InnoHub), was opened in early 2024. Named after Frank and Mary Labriola, the InnoHub&#x27;s 37,000 square feet and supporting buildings host the capstone design program, student design competition teams, and students&#x27; entrepreneurial and personal endeavors. The InnoHub also consists of a machine shop, woodworking shop, composite workshop, electronics lab, tool rental center, additive manufacturing lab, and open-build space for student use.

McNeil Hall contains classrooms dedicated to cornerstone and capstone design classes, as well as a large parking structure. The Mines Police Department, Lock Smith, Environmental Health and Safety, and Parking Services are also based on the first floor.

=== Beck Venture Center ===
The Beck Venture Center provides business mentorship and support for students and faculty to build businesses. Multiple venture capitalists, angel investors, and engineering consultants maintain offices in the Venture Center to support the campus business ecosystem. Mines, through the Beck Venture Center, is one of ten members of the western division of the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Innovation Corps Program, which provides students and faculty with grants to pursue their inventions.

=== Edgar Experimental Mine ===
The Edgar Experimental Mine is the primary educational mine owned by Mines in Idaho Springs. The mine was originally a silver and gold mine founded in 1870 by the Big Five Mining Company. It was acquired by Mines in 1921 after Big Five declared bankruptcy. Edgar Mine is primarily used to train mining engineers, although it is also used by various state and federal agencies to develop a wide range of products and techniques, including the U.S. Army&#x27;s tunnel detection program, which built one of the mine&#x27;s two portals.

The mine features a fully operational mine railway, internet system, and classroom. In addition to being used by mining engineers, it is also used by electrical, biological, and civil engineering students for various projects.Edgar Mine Classroom | Rock Powered Life | University of Colorado Boulder The property also contains an outdoor explosives lab used by researchers and educational creators, like the Slow-Mo-Guys.

In 2023, the FreePort-McMoRan Foundation gave $1 million to modernize Edgar Mine.

== Academics ==
Mines began the world&#x27;s first graduate program in space resources in the fall semester of 2018, offering both master&#x27;s and PhD degrees.

=== University Honors and Scholars programs ===

==== Thorson First-Year Honors ====
The Thorson First-Year Honors program replaces two freshman-level classes with Thorson-specific classes that emphasize the intersections of STEM and the humanities. Students apply to the Thorson Honors program before beginning their freshman year at Mines. Each cohort of Thorson Scholars is split into seminar sessions led by interdisciplinary faculty teams that dive into critical thinking, design, communication, and ethical problem solving. Thorson Honors students who are also approved for the Mines Study Abroad Program are given the opportunity to study in Antibes, France for their first semester.

==== Grandey First-Year Honors ====
The Grandey First-Year Honors program uses a leadership lens and a maker mindset to educate its scholars in principles of problem solving, team communication, and project management. Similar to the Thorson First-Year Honors Program, the Grandey Honors Program replaces two freshmen-level classes with small seminar classes led by a rotating team of expert faculty.

====McBride Honors====
The McBride Honors Program in Public Affairs integrates the liberal arts with science and engineering. Accepting about 40 students per year, the McBride Honors Program places a high emphasis on internships, particularly in public policy, industry, and the non-profit sector.

To graduate with McBride Honors, scholars must complete a series of specialty classes as well as a self-designed practicum. Past practica have included studying abroad, landscape painting, and making documentaries. Practicum funding is typically provided by the scholar and program aid, depending on the scholar&#x27;s needs.

==== Harvey Scholars ====
The Harvey Scholars program attracts students with a passion for service. Programming includes luncheons with donors Hugh and Michelle Harvey, community-wide service activities, off-campus retreats, and small group dinners.

A Harvey Scholarship covers full tuition and mandatory fees for eight semesters at Mines. It also includes travel and enrichment grants to support study abroad programs, research pursuits, and professional development.

==== Vanguard and Caldwell Scholars ====
The Vanguard and Caldwell Communities of Scholars are for highly motivated female students who embody leadership skills and a desire to improve our world through science, technology, engineering and mathematics. These service leadership programs develop transformational leaders through professional development, community service, and academic success opportunities over the course of four years.

As members of the Vanguard and Caldwell communities, scholars benefit from vertically integrated support within the cohort, access to women faculty and campus leadership, in addition to financial assistance. The Caldwell students receive a full tuition scholarship and are identified as students who demonstrate a commitment to the legacy and ideals of Florence Caldwell.  Vanguard scholars receive a partial scholarship and are identified as students who will lead the way in making advances in STEM for society upon graduation.

==== Mines Undergraduate Research Fellowship (MURF) ====
The Mines Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program provides funding for full-time undergraduate students to collaborate with campus researchers. This provides students with an opportunity to participate in research projects under the mentorship of Mines faculty in every field represented at Mines. Some past research MURF students have contributed to includes research on Particle Physics, Explosives Engineering, and Oceanography.

=== Field Session ===
Every undergraduate must complete one or more field sessions. Field session is designed to expose student&#x27;s to practical skills in their discipline and provide experience graduates can lean on in their careers. Typically, field sessions are offered in the summer, although some departments offer field sessions during the academic year.

Field session topics depend on the students interests and major. Earth science students go on trips to survey and conduct research, while engineering students may complete a co-op, build semiconductors, or operate a chemical plant.

Of the incoming class, 32.7% were women.

== Traditions ==
=== M Climb ===
Freshmen students at Colorado School of Mines are expected (but not required) to participate in the M Climb during orientation week. During this climb, students carry a ten-pound rock up Mt. Zion. Before ascending up the mountain, students are given colored hard-hats, which are spray-painted by members of the Blue Key Honor Society. Along the climb, non-freshmen encourage the new students with water balloons, silly string, and lead the new students in learning the Mines&#x27; fight song. At the top of the mountain, students place their rock on the &quot;M,&quot; a large sign made of rocks in the shape of Mines&#x27; M logo, and paint the M white using whitewash. On graduation, seniors are invited to take a rock from the M as a keepsake of their time at Mines.

=== E-Days ===
Beginning in 1934, Mines students have celebrated Engineering Days during the spring semester. During E-Days, classes are canceled and students attend a variety of events beginning with the ore cart pull. Students take turns pulling an ore cart down 7.5 miles of Colfax Avenue to the state capitol building, where the governor of Colorado officially declares the start of E-Days. E-Days continues with field events, tech demos, concerts, comedians, manual mining competitions, and a trebuchet contest. The next morning, teams race cardboard boats down Clear Creek, competing to see which team sails the farthest before sinking. A carnival is held during the day and the Formula SAE club hosts a car show.
=== Silver Diplomas ===
The tradition of awarding silver diplomas was started in 1934 by Charles Hull, an Instrument Designer at Mines. Since then, every graduate receives a silver diploma upon graduation from Mines. In 1935, President Herbert Hoover, who was a guest at the commencement ceremonies, was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Engineering for his contribution in translating &quot;De re metallica&quot; from Latin to English.

=== Blaster the Burro ===
In the 1930s, a Golden local began to bring his burro to football games. The burro quickly became the school mascot, now known as &quot;Blaster the Burro&quot;. Blaster is represented by two separate burros, both racing burros from Idaho Springs, Colorado. Both are known as Blaster while at Mines.

=== Engineer&#x27;s Hats ===
Around 1890 as a celebration of graduation, graduates of Mines received their &quot;Engineer&#x27;s&quot; hat. These hats were worn by engineers while working underground, and whenever a visitor to a mine wanted to talk to the engineer, they were told to go find the guy in the funny hat. Today, graduates receive one of two versions of the Engineer&#x27;s hat, to be signed and branded upon graduation.

== Athletics ==
Colorado School of Mines was ranked best NCAA DII school in the U.S. for student-athletes, according to Next College Student Athlete&#x27;s 2022 NCSA Power Rankings. The NCSA Power Rankings recognize the best colleges and universities in the U.S. for student-athletes.

In 2022, the Orediggers won their third national title in men&#x27;s cross country, posting the largest margin of victory in meet history with 143-points. In December 2022, Oredigger football played in their first NCAA Division II national championship in McKinney, Texas, and lost to Ferris State 41-14.

<doc id="340944" wikidata="Q10869901" url="?curid=340944" title="Cyrus the Great in the Bible">
<text>Cyrus the Great, who founded the Achaemenid Empire in 550 BC and ruled it until his death in 530 BC, is the subject of much praise in the Hebrew Bible. He is noted for his role in conquering the Neo-Babylonian Empire and thereafter liberating the Jewish people from the Babylonian captivity, which had begun after the fall of the Kingdom of Judah in 587 BCE.

According to the biblical narrative, in the first year of Cyrus&#x27; reign, he was prompted by God to issue the Edict of Cyrus, a royal decree that, in the aftermath of the fall of Babylon, called for exiled Jews to be repatriated to the Land of Israel and for the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, thus initiating the return to Zion. Moreover, he showed his interest in the project by sending back with them the sacred vessels that had been taken from Solomon&#x27;s Temple during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, along with a considerable sum of money with which to buy building materials. His efforts culminated in the construction of the Second Temple in Yehud Medinata, marking the beginning of the Second Temple period and Second Temple Judaism, which would continue until the Roman siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. For this accomplishment, Cyrus is venerated as a messiah—the only non-Jew (as he was a Persian) to be held in this regard in Judaism.

The historicity of Cyrus&#x27; decree has been debated among scholars, as has the impact that it may have had on the nascent Jewish diaspora if the events of the Hebrew Bible did indeed take place as they are described.

==Cyrus&#x27; conquest of Babylon==
=== Liberation of the Jewish people ===
Cyrus the Great is highly regarded in accounts of Jewish literature. It is likely that, after the Persian conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, he had commenced his relationship with exilic Jewish leaders, and the Book of Isaiah says that he was anointed by God.

The Hebrew Bible states that Cyrus issued the royal decree of liberation to the Jews. His edict for the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people. According to , &quot;the enemies of Judah and Benjamin&quot; asked to help build the Second Temple, and when this was denied, they hired counselors to frustrate the Judahites from completing the project throughout the reign of Cyrus, Xerxes (&quot;Ahasuerus&quot;), and Artaxerxes, until the reign of Darius II. The work recommenced under the exhortations of the Hebrew prophets, and when the authorities asked the Jews what right they had to build their Temple, they referred to the decree of Cyrus. Darius I, who was then reigning, caused a search for this alleged decree to be made, and it was found in the archives at Ecbatana, whereupon Darius reaffirmed it, allowing the work to proceed to its triumphant close.

A chronicle drawn up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus gives the history of the reign of Nabonidus (&quot;Nabu-na&#x27;id&quot;), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. In 538 BC, there was a revolt in southern Babylonia, while the Persian army entered the country from the north. In June, the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and immediately afterwards, Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror. Gobryas (&quot;Ugbaru&quot;), the governor of Media, was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered &quot;without fighting,&quot; and the daily services at the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to &quot;all the province of Babylon,&quot; of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cyrus&#x27; son Cambyses II conducted his funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of king of Babylon, claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time, he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their homelands, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of the destroyed Solomon&#x27;s Temple from Jerusalem.

==== Motive ====
Speculation abounds as to the reasoning for Cyrus&#x27; release of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity. One argument is that Cyrus was a Zoroastrian—a follower of the religion that defined and played a dominant role in Persian society until the rise of Islam—and would have felt a kindred spirit with the people of Judaism. Another possibility is the magnanimous respect he is ascribed to have evinced for the diverse beliefs and customs of the peoples within his extended kingdom. As one example, upon the conquest of Babylonia itself, it is recorded that he paid homage at the temple of Marduk, the Babylonian national god, thereby gaining the support of the Babylonian people and minimizing further bloodshed. While Jewish tradition, as described previously in , indicates that &quot;the inspired King Cyrus of Persia to issue this proclamation,&quot; in the Cyrus Cylinder, he pays homage to Marduk. This Babylonian document has been interpreted as referring to the return to their homelands of several displaced cultural groups, one of which could have been the Jews:

From [Babylon] to Aššur and (from) Susa, Agade, Ešnunna, Zamban, Me-Turnu, Der, as far as the region of Gutium, the sacred centres on the other side of the Tigris, whose sanctuaries had been abandoned for a long time, I returned the images of the gods, who had resided there, to their places and I let them dwell in eternal abodes. I gathered all their inhabitants and returned to them their dwellings. In addition, at the command of Marduk, the great lord, I settled in their habitations, in pleasing abodes, the gods of Sumer and Akkad, whom Nabonidus, to the anger of the lord of the gods, had brought into Babylon. (lines 30–33)

However, it has been argued that it must be referring to people associated to the image&#x27;s cult, as opposed to deportees. Diana V. Edelman has pointed at the serious chronological difficulties that arise when it is accepted that the Jews returned during the reign of Cyrus.

The terms used by the author of Deutero-Isaiah are reminiscent of certain passages in the Cyrus Cylinder. Traditionally, these passages in Isaiah were believed to predate the rule of Cyrus by about 100 years; however, most modern scholars date Isaiah 40–55 towards the end of the Babylonian captivity. Whereas Isaiah 1–39 (referred to as Proto-Isaiah) saw the destruction of Israel as imminent and the restoration in the future, Deutero-Isaiah speaks of the destruction in the past () and the restoration as imminent (). Notice, for example, the change in temporal perspective from , where the Babylonian captivity is cast far in the future, to , where the Israelites are spoken of as already in Babylon. According to Roger Norman Whybray, the author of Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40–55) was mistaken in thinking that Cyrus would destroy Babylon, while he instead made it more splendid than ever, and though he did allow the Jewish exiles to return home, it was not exactly in the triumphant manner that was predicted in Deutero-Isaiah.
Then the alliance between Cyrus and God (Yahweh) is made explicit:

=== Rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem ===

Among the classical Jewish sources, besides the biblical account, Josephus mentions that Cyrus freed the Jews from captivity and helped rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. He also wrote to the other rulers and governors of the region, instructing them to contribute to the project. A letter from Cyrus to the Jewish people is described by Josephus:
===Historicity of the Edict of Cyrus===

The historical nature of Cyrus&#x27; royal decree has been challenged. Lester L. Grabbe has argued that there was no decree, but that there was a policy that allowed exiles to return to their homelands and rebuild their places of worship. He also argues that the archaeology suggests that the Jews&#x27; repatriation to Zion was a &quot;trickle&quot; that took place over years, perhaps decades, resulting in a maximum population of perhaps 30,000. Mary Joan Winn Leith says that, although the biblical decree may be authentic, the Cyrus Cylinder cannot confirm it. She also notes that &quot;the Cylinder never calls for a general release of deportees or a universal restoration of centres of worship that had suffered at Babylonian hands.&quot; Through these decrees, Cyrus, like earlier rulers, was attempting to gain support from those who might be strategically important, particularly of those who were close to Egypt, which he wished to conquer. She also wrote that &quot;appeals to Marduk in the Cylinder and to Yahweh in the biblical decree demonstrate the Persian tendency to co-opt local religious and political traditions in the interest of imperial control.&quot;

<text>James Minter Knepper (November 22, 1927 – June 14, 2003) was an American jazz trombonist. In addition to his own recordings as leader, Knepper performed and recorded with Charlie Barnet, Woody Herman, Claude Thornhill, Stan Kenton, Benny Goodman, Gil Evans, Thad Jones and Mel Lewis, Toshiko Akiyoshi and Lew Tabackin, and, most famously, Charles Mingus in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Knepper died in 2003 of complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Biography==
Knepper was born in Los Angeles, California, United States, the second son of a nurse and a police officer. His parents divorced shortly after his birth, and his mother had to take her abusive husband to court in order to get child support. He and his older brother, Robert, were sent to several boarding and military schools, Page Military Academy and St. John&#x27;s Military Academy, while their mother worked. He picked up his first instrument, an alto horn, at the age of six while he was a pupil there. His first teacher persuaded him to put aside the alto and pick up the trombone because, as he said, he had a &quot;trombone mouth&quot;. He played his first professional gigs in Los Angeles, and traveled to Spokane, Washington, at the age of 15. He graduated high school, and later attended classes at Los Angeles Community College.

Knepper married Maxine Helen Fields, a trumpet player with the all-female jazz band the International Sweethearts of Rhythm on May 8, 1954, at a civil ceremony in Tucson, Arizona, while he was on a tour with the Maynard Ferguson Band. They had two children, a daughter, Robin Reid Knepper Mahonen, and a son, Timothy Jay Knepper, who predeceased him. Knepper chose the names &quot;Robin&quot; and &quot;Jay&quot; to honor his idol, Charlie Parker, whom the jazz world knew as &quot;Bird&quot;. He had four grandchildren.

In 1959, the U.S. State Department funded a trip for bandleader Herbie Mann to visit Africa, after they heard his version of &quot;African Suite.&quot; In a stroke of serendipity, Knepper replaced Willie Dennis as trombonist in the band for this tour.
The 14-week tour took place from December 31 1959 to April 5, 1960. The musicians were:
Herbie Mann, bandleader, flute and sax;
Johnny Rae, vibist and arranger;
Don Payne, bass;
Doc Cheatham, trumpet;
Jimmy Knepper, trombone; 
Carlos &quot;Patato&quot; Valdes, conguero;
Jose Mangual, bongos.
Destinations listed on official itinerary: 
Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia. 
Knepper documented this tour meticulously in a series of letters he sent home to his wife, Maxine, his daughter, Robin, and his son, Timothy. These letters were recently found carefully preserved in a dusty box in the attic of the family home, and have now been transcribed by his daughter. They provide a fascinating glimpse into the inner circles of a notable piece of jazz history, and the life of a touring musician, who was also a devoted family man. He paints vivid portraits of the personal life of the musicians he worked with, and his descriptions of the Africa&#x27;s landscapes and people provide a vivid portrait of an era in which there were few civil rights for Africans in their own lands. Knepper&#x27;s daughter is hoping to publish these letters. 

In 1962, Knepper toured the Soviet Union with Benny Goodman&#x27;s Big Band, as part of a cultural exchange during the Cold War, in which the Bolshoi Ballet also came to the US. This groundbreaking yet disastrous tour was also documented in Knepper&#x27;s letters.

Knepper also played in the pit orchestra through the entire run of the Broadway show &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, with Barbra Streisand, and later, Mimi Hines. After seventeen previews, the Broadway production opened on March 26, 1964, at the Winter Garden Theatre, subsequently transferring to the Majestic Theatre and the Broadway Theatre to complete its total run of 1,348 performances. In 1967 and 1968, he played in the pit orchestra at the Mark Hellinger Theater for &quot;An Evening with Marlene Dietrich&quot;, for which Dietrich received a Tony Award in 1968. He also appeared on and off Broadway in &quot;On Your Toes&quot;, and &quot;The Me Nobody Knows&quot;.

While he was playing &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, Knepper became a member of the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra, a big band formed by trumpeter Thad Jones and drummer Mel Lewis around 1965, which began the 40-year tradition of Monday night jazz shows at the Village Vanguard in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village. The band performed for twelve years in its original incarnation, but since the death of Lewis in 1990 it has been known as the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra. They have maintained a Monday-night residency at the Village Vanguard for four decades. Knepper again toured the USSR, this time with TJML, as well as Japan and Europe with them, and appeared with them at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1974.

In 1969, Knepper toured and recorded &quot;You Never Know Who Your Friends Are&quot;, with keyboardist Al Kooper, in the jazz period which followed his departure from Blood, Sweat and Tears. Knepper appeared on this concert tour which included shows at the Philadelphia Spectrum, and in Atlanta, where he briefly met Janis Joplin.

In 1980, he received a Grammy Award nomination, for &quot;Best Jazz Instrumentalist Performance, Soloist&quot;, for his album, &quot;Cunningbird&quot;.

Knepper received &quot;Best Trombonist&quot; award from &quot;DownBeat&quot; Reader&#x27;s Poll four years running from 1981 to 1984; he also achieved first place in the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Critics&#x27; Poll in 1981, and then five years running from 1983 to 1987.

==With Mingus==
Although Knepper worked with some of the most notable jazz musicians of the 20th century, he was perhaps best known for his collaboration and stormy relationship with bassist and composer, Charles Mingus.

Mingus&#x27; temper was notoriously bad, and he twice hit Knepper. Once, while onstage at a memorial concert in Philadelphia, Mingus reportedly attempted to crush the hands of his pianist, Toshiko Akiyoshi, with the instrument&#x27;s keyboard cover, then punched Knepper; however, the legitimacy of this story has been called into question by both Akiyoshi and Mingus&#x27;s son Eric Mingus. Later, Mingus reportedly punched Knepper in the mouth while the two men were working together at Mingus&#x27;s apartment on a score for Epitaph, in preparation for what became his disastrous concert at New York Town Hall, on October 12, 1962. The blow broke one of Knepper&#x27;s teeth, ruined his embouchure and resulted in the loss of the top octave of his range on the trombone for almost two years. This attack ended their working relationship, and Knepper was unable to perform at the concert. Charged with assault, Mingus appeared in court in January 1963 and was given a suspended sentence. According to his daughter, Robin, Mingus also later mailed heroin to Knepper&#x27;s home, and made an anonymous phone call to the police. A little girl at the time, she remembers the police questioning her father after the mailman delivered the package. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, the two eventually reconciled thoroughly enough to play together in concert and on at least one of Mingus&#x27; last albums.
Following Mingus&#x27; death, and the death of the first Mingus Dynasty bandleader, drummer Dannie Richmond, Knepper led the Mingus Dynasty Orchestra, and toured the Middle East and Europe.

<text>Yan (; Old Chinese pronunciation: &quot;*&quot;) was an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou dynasty. Its capital was Ji (later known as Yanjing and now Beijing). During the Warring States period, the court was also moved to another capital at Xiadu at times.

The history of Yan began in the Western Zhou in the early first millennium BC. After the authority of the Zhou king declined during the Spring and Autumn period in the 8th century BC, Yan survived and became one of the strongest states in China. During the Warring States period from the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, Yan was one of the last states to be conquered by the armies of Qin Shihuang: Yan fell in 222 BC, the year before the declaration of the Qin Empire. Yan experienced a brief period of independence after the collapse of the Qin dynasty in 207 BC, but it was eventually absorbed by the victorious Han.

During its height, Yan stretched from the Yellow River to the Yalu River and from the mountains of Shanxi to the Liaodong Peninsula. As the northernmost of all the Chinese states during this time period, Yan faced incursions from steppe nomads and as such, built great walls.

==History==

According to Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, King Wu of Zhou deposed King Zhou of Shang at the Battle of Muye () and conferred titles to nobles within his domain, including the rulers of the Yan.

In the 11th century BC, Yan&#x27;s capital was based in what is now Liulihe Township, Fangshan District, Beijing, where a large walled settlement and over 200 tombs of nobility have been unearthed. Among the most significant artifacts from the Liulihe Site is a bronze ding with inscriptions that recount the journey of the eldest son of the Duke of Yan, who delivered offerings to the King of Zhou in present-day Xi&#x27;an and was awarded a position in the king&#x27;s court.

Some time during the 7th century BC in the late Western Zhou or early Eastern Zhou, Yan absorbed the State of Ji, a smaller kingdom to the north and moved its capital to that of Ji in modern-day Xicheng District, Beijing.

To the south, the bordering states of Zhao and Qi were Yan&#x27;s main rivals. The mountainous border in the west between Zhao and Yan became the area in which their armies often clashed. Despite this, the war between Zhao and Yan usually dragged on into a stalemate, requiring the help of other kingdoms to conclude.

At the turn of the 3rd century BC, General Qin Kai launched a series of campaigns against the Donghu and Gojoseon, expanding the kingdom&#x27;s frontiers nearly one thousand kilometers east to northwestern Korean Peninsula. A Great Wall was constructed on Yan&#x27;s new northern borders, and five commanderies, Shanggu, Yuyang, Youbeiping, Liaoxi and Liaodong, were subsequently established for the defense against the Donghu.

The Central Plains states seemed to hold Yan culture and other peripheral states like Qin in low regard. Archaeological discoveries in the state of Yan have uncovered ornaments that, while inscribed with Chinese writing, were close in style to that of the northern nomadic tribes. The currency of Yan was crafted into the shape of a knife, a form closely associated with the nomads. This form of currency might have been specially made for trade with the nomads, demonstrating the importance of commercial relations with them.

The strongest opposition came from the Qi, one of the strongest states in China. A succession crisis started in Yan in 325 BC when king Zikuai symbolically resigned his throne in favor of his minister Zizhi to prove his humility; the minister took advantage and seized power. While this crisis happened, in 314 BC Qi invaded and in a little over several months practically conquered the country. However, due to the misconduct of Qi troops during the conquest of Yan a revolt eventually drove them away and the borders of Yan were restored. Yan&#x27;s new king, King Zhao of Yan then plotted with the states of Zhao, Qin, Han and Wei for a joint expedition against Qi. Led by the brilliant tactician Yue Yi, it was highly successful and within a year most of Qi&#x27;s seventy walled cities had fallen, with the exception of Zimu and Lu. However, with the death of King Zhao and the expulsion of Yue Yi to Zhao by the new king, King Wei of Yan, General Tian Dan managed to recapture all of the cities from the 5 kingdoms.

Despite the wars, Yan survived through the Warring States period. In 227 BC, with Qin troops on the border after the collapse of Zhao, Crown Prince Dan sent an assassin named Jing Ke to kill the king of Qin (later Qin Shi Huang), hoping to end the Qin threat. The mission failed, with Jing Ke dying at the hands of the King of Qin in Xianyang.

Surprised and enraged by such a bold act, the king of Qin called on Wang Jian to destroy Yan. Crushing the bulk of the Yan army at the frozen Yi River, Ji fell the following year and the ruler, King Xi, fled to the Liaodong Peninsula.

In 222 BC, Liaodong fell as well, and Yan was overrun by Qin. Yan was the third to last state to fall, and with its destruction the fates of the remaining two kingdoms were sealed. In 221 BC, Qin conquered all of China, ending the Warring States period and founding the Qin dynasty.

===Post-Qin interregnum===

In 207 BC, the Qin dynasty collapsed and China resumed a state of civil war. King Wu Chen of Zhao eventually sent General Han Guang to conquer Yan for Zhao, but upon his conquest, Han Guang appointed himself King of Yan. Han Guang had sent General Zang Tu to assist Xiang Yu, the king of Chu, in his war against Qin. When Zang Tu returned, Han Guang was ordered to become King of Liaodong instead. When Han Guang refused, Zang Tu killed him and declared himself King of both Yan and Liaodong.

Zang Tu submitted Yan to the Han dynasty during the war between Han and Chu in order to keep his title, but once the war was finished he revolted. Liu Bang (later Emperor Gaozu of Han) sent Fan Kuai and Zhou Bo to put down the rebellion, and they captured and executed Zang Tu. His son Zang Yan fled to exile among the Xiongnu.

Lu Wan became the new King of Yan and reigned there for most of Liu Bang&#x27;s life, until the emperor discovered that he had sent officials to the courts of the rebel Chen Xi and the Xiongnu chanyu Modu. Summoned to the imperial court, Lu Wan feigned illness and then fled to the Xiongnu, who honored him as the King of the Eastern Nomads (&quot;Donghu&quot;) until his death. In the meantime, Yan came under direct control of the Han dynasty and was treated as a princely appanage.

==Yan in astronomy==

Yan is represented by the star Zeta Capricorni in the &quot;Twelve States&quot; asterism, part of the lunar mansion &quot;Girl&quot; in the &quot;Black Tortoise&quot; symbol. Yan is also represented by the star Nu Ophiuchi in the &quot;Left Wall&quot; asterism in the &quot;Heavenly Market&quot; enclosure.

==Culture and society==
Before the state of Qin unified China in 221 BC, each region had its own unique customs and culture, although all were dominated by an upper class that shared a largely common culture. In the &quot;Yu Gong&quot; (Tribute of Yu), a section of the Book of Documents which was most likely composed in the 4th century BC, the author describes a China that is divided into nine regions, each with its own distinctive culture and products. The core theme of this section is that these nine regions are unified into one state by the travels of the eponymous sage, Yu the Great and by sending each region&#x27;s unique goods to the capital as tribute. Other texts also discussed these regional variations in culture and physical environments.

One of these texts was &quot;The Book of Master Wu&quot;, written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the other states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were reflective of the terrain they live in. Of Yan, he said:

<text>Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center (JSLC; also known as Shuangchengzi Missile Test Center; Launch Complex B2; formally Northwest Comprehensive Missile Testing Facility (); Base 20; 63600 Unit) is a Chinese space vehicle launch facility (spaceport), a corps grade subordinate unit of the PLA Aerospace Force. It is located between the Ejin Banner, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia and Hangtian Town, Jinta County, Jiuquan Prefecture, Gansu Province. It is part of the Dongfeng Aerospace City (Base 10). Because 95% of JSLC located in Jinta County, Jiuquan, the launch center is named after Jiuquan. The launch center straddles both sides of the Ruo Shui river.

== History ==
It was founded in 1958, the first of China&#x27;s four spaceports. As with most Chinese launch facilities, it is remote and generally closed to foreigners.

The Satellite Launch Center is a part of Dongfeng Space City (), also known as &quot;Base 10&quot; () or &quot;Dongfeng base&quot; (). The Dongfeng site also includes People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) test flight facilities, a space museum and a so-called martyr&#x27;s cemetery ().

JSLC is usually used to launch vehicles into lower and medium orbits with large orbital inclination angles, as well as testing medium to long-range missiles. Its facilities are state of the art and provide support to every phase of a satellite launch campaign. The site includes the Technical Center, the Launch Complex, the Launch Control Center, the Mission Command and Control Center and various other logistical support systems.

The center covers 2800 km2 and may have housing for as many as 20,000 people. The facilities and launch support equipment were likely modelled on Soviet counterparts and the Soviet Union likely provided technical support to Jiuquan.

Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center was expanded during the Third Front campaign to develop basic industry and national defense industry in China&#x27;s rugged interior to prepare for potential invasion by the Soviet Union or the United States.

The launch center has been the focus of many of China&#x27;s ventures into space, including their first satellite &quot;Dong Fang Hong I&quot; 
in 1970, and their first crewed space mission &quot;Shenzhou 5&quot; on 15 October 2003. As of 2021, all Chinese crewed space flights, meaning all flights in the Shenzhou program including crewed flights to the Tiangong space station, have launched from Jiuquan.

In August 2016, China launched the first quantum communication satellite, the &quot;Quantum Experiments at Space Scale&quot;, from the center.

In August 2018, Chinese private rocket manufacturing startups i-Space and OneSpace launched sub-orbital rockets from the center. On 25 July 2019, the first Chinese private orbital launch took place from Jiuquan as I-Space launched their Hyperbola-1 rocket.

==Launch pads==
The launch site comprises two launch complexes, each containing several launch locations. All the launch statistics reported below are up to date as of December 2023.

=== North Launch Complex ===
The North Launch Complex consists in two different launch areas, both currently inactive.

*Launch Area 2: used for both orbital launches and ballistic missile tests.
** LA-2A: used for launches of the DF-3 and DF-5 ballistic missiles and hosted the first Chinese orbital launches, carried out through the CZ-1 launch vehicle. It hasn&#x27;t hosted orbital launch attempts since 1971. ()
** LA-2B: used for orbital launches of the CZ-2A, CZ-2C, CZ-2D and FB-1 launch vehicles. It has been last used in 1996. ()

*Launch Area 3: situated approximately 2.7 km south of Launch Area 2, used for launches of the DF-1, DF-2 and R-2 ballistic missiles.

<doc id="340950" wikidata="Q1097191" url="?curid=340950" title="Claude Thornhill">
<text>Claude Thornhill (August 10, 1908 – July 1, 1965) was an American pianist, arranger, composer, and bandleader. He composed the jazz and pop standards &quot;Snowfall&quot; and &quot;I Wish I Had You&quot;.

==Early years==
Thornhill was the son of J. Chester Thornhill and his wife, Maude. When he was 11 years old, he played piano professionally. While still a youth, he played with two local combos. As a student at Garfield High School in Terre Haute, he played with several theater bands. Thornhill studied at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.

==Career==
As a youth, he was recognized as an extraordinary talent and formed a traveling duo with Danny Polo, a musical prodigy on the clarinet and trumpet from nearby Clinton, Indiana.

He and clarinetist Artie Shaw started their careers at the Golden Pheasant in Cleveland, Ohio, with the Austin Wylie Orchestra. Thornhill and Shaw went to New York together in 1931. Thornhill went to the West Coast in the late 1930s with the Bob Hope Radio Show and arranged for Judy Garland in &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;. In 1935, he played on sessions with Glenn Miller, including &quot;Solo Hop&quot;, which was released on Columbia Records. He also played with Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, Ray Noble, and Billie Holiday. He arranged &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; and &quot;Annie Laurie&quot; for Maxine Sullivan.

During the mid-1930s, Thornhill arranged and played piano for Andre Kostelanetz.

In 1939, he founded the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. Polo was his lead clarinet player. Although the Thornhill band was a sophisticated dance band, it became known for its superior jazz musicians and for Thornhill&#x27;s and Gil Evans&#x27;s arrangements. The band played without vibrato, so that the timbres of the instruments could be better appreciated. Thornhill encouraged the musicians to develop cool-sounding tones. The band was popular with both musicians and the public. Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; nonet was modeled in part on Thornhill&#x27;s sound and unconventional instrumentation. The band&#x27;s most successful records were &quot;Snowfall&quot;, &quot;A Sunday Kind of Love&quot;, and &quot;Love for Love&quot;.

Thornhill was playing at the Paramount Theater in New York for $10,000 a week when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an apprentice seaman on October 26, 1942. As chief musician, he performed shows across the Pacific Theater with Jackie Cooper as his drummer and Dennis Day as his vocalist.

In 1946, he was discharged from the Navy and reunited his ensemble. Polo, Gerry Mulligan, and Barry Galbraith returned with new members, Red Rodney, Lee Konitz, Joe Shulman, and Bill Barber. Thornhill and his orchestra played for the &quot;Judy, Jill and Johnny&quot; variety program on radio on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1946–1947.

In 1957, Thornhill became Tony Bennett&#x27;s musical director. He offered his big band library to Gerry Mulligan when Mulligan formed the Concert Jazz Band, but Mulligan declined the gift, since his instrumentation was different. A large portion of his extensive library of music is currently held by Drury University in Springfield, Missouri.

Thornhill died of a heart attack in Caldwell, New Jersey, at the age of 56. In 1984, he was posthumously inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.

==Compositions ==

Thornhill&#x27;s compositions included the standard &quot;Snowfall&quot;, &quot;I Wish I Had You&quot;, recorded by Billie Holiday and Fats Waller, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, &quot;Shore Road&quot;, &quot;Portrait of a Guinea Farm&quot;, &quot;Lodge Podge&quot;, &quot;Rustle of Spring&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Time for Us to Part&quot;, &quot;It Was a Lover and His Lass&quot;, &quot;The Little Red Man&quot;, &quot;Memory of an Island&quot;, and a big band arrangement of the folk song &quot;Where Has My Little Dog Gone?&quot;

===Cover versions of &quot;Snowfall&quot;===
Thornhill&#x27;s 1941 piano composition &quot;Snowfall&quot;, later had lyrics written by his wife, Ruth Thornhill. It has been recorded in vocal and non-vocal versions by the following artists:

<text>A genetic screen or mutagenesis screen is an experimental technique used to identify and select individuals who possess a phenotype of interest in a mutagenized population. Hence a genetic screen is a type of phenotypic screen. Genetic screens can provide important information on gene function as well as the molecular events that underlie a biological process or pathway. While genome projects have identified an extensive inventory of genes in many different organisms, genetic screens can provide valuable insight as to how those genes function.

== Basic screening ==

Forward genetics (or a forward genetic screen) starts with a phenotype and then attempts to identify the causative mutation and thus gene(s) responsible for the phenotype. For instance, the famous screen by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus mutagenized fruit flies and then set out to find the genes causing the observed mutant phenotypes.

Successful forward genetic screens often require a defined genetic background and a simple experimental procedure. That is, when multiple individuals are mutagenized they should be genetically identical so that their wild-type phenotype is identical too and mutant phenotypes are easier to identify. A simple screening method allows for a larger number of individuals to be screened, thereby increasing the probability of generating and identifying mutants of interest.

Since natural allelic mutations are rare prior to screening geneticists often mutagenize a population of individuals by exposing them to a known mutagen, such as a chemical or radiation, thereby generating a much higher frequency of chromosomal mutations. In some organisms mutagens are used to perform saturation screens, that is, a screen used to uncover &quot;all&quot; genes involved in a particular phenotype. Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus were the first individuals to perform this type of screening procedure in animals.

Reverse genetics (or a reverse genetic screen), starts with a known gene and assays the effect of its disruption by analyzing the resultant phenotypes. For example, in a knock-out screen, one or more genes are completely deleted and the deletion mutants are tested for phenotypes. Such screens have been done for all genes in many bacteria and even complex organisms, such as &quot;C. elegans&quot;. A reverse genetic screen typically begins with a gene sequence followed by targeted inactivation. Moreover, it induces mutations in model organisms to learn their role in disease. Reverse genetics is also used to provide extremely accurate statistics on mutations that occur in specific genes. From these screens you are able to determine how fortuitous the mutations are, and how often the mutations occur.

== Screening variations ==

Many screening variations have been devised to elucidate a gene that leads to a mutant phenotype of interest.

=== Enhancer ===

An enhancer screen begins with a mutant individual that has an affected process of interest with a known gene mutation. The screen can then be used to identify additional genes or gene mutations that play a role in that biological or physiological process. A genetic enhancer screen identifies mutations that enhance a phenotype of interest in an already mutant individual. The phenotype of the double mutant (individual with both the enhancer and original background mutation) is more prominent than either of the single mutant phenotypes. The enhancement must surpass the expected phenotypes of the two mutations on their own, and therefore each mutation may be considered an enhancer of the other. Isolating enhancer mutants can lead to the identification of interacting genes or genes which act redundantly with respect to one another.

=== Suppressor ===

A suppressor screen is used to identify suppressor mutations that alleviate or revert the phenotype of the original mutation, in a process defined as synthetic viability. Suppressor mutations can be described as second mutations at a site on the chromosome distinct from the mutation under study, which suppress the phenotype of the original mutation. If the mutation is in the same gene as the original mutation it is known as intragenic suppression, whereas a mutation located in a different gene is known as extragenic suppression or intergenic suppression. Suppressor mutations are extremely useful to define the functions of biochemical pathways within a cell and the relationships between different biochemical pathways.

=== Temperature sensitive ===

A temperature-sensitive screen involves performing temperature shifts to enhance a mutant phenotype. A population grown at low temperatures would have a normal phenotype; however, the mutation in the particular gene would make it unstable at a higher temperature. A screen for temperature sensitivity in fruit flies, for example, might involve raising the temperature in the cage until some flies faint, then opening a portal to let the others escape. Individuals selected in a screen are liable to carry an unusual version of a gene involved in the phenotype of interest. An advantage of alleles found in this type of screen is that the mutant phenotype is conditional and can be activated by simply raising the temperature. A null mutation in such a gene may be lethal to the embryo and such mutants would be missed in a basic screen. A famous temperature-sensitive screen was carried out independently by Lee Hartwell and Paul Nurse to identify mutants defective in the cell cycle in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;S. pombe&quot;, respectively.

=== RNAi ===
RNA interference (RNAi) screen is essentially a forward genetics screen using a reverse genetics technique. Similar to classical genetic screens in the past, large-scale RNAi surveys success depends on a careful development of phenotypic assays and their interpretation. In Drosophila, RNAi has been applied in cultured cells or in vivo to investigate gene functions and to effect the function of single genes on a genome-wide scale. RNAi is used to silence gene expression in Drosophila by injecting dsRNA into early embryos, and interfering with Frizzled and Frizzled2 genes creating defects in embryonic patterning that mimic loss of wingless function.

=== CRISPR ===
CRISPR/Cas is primarily used for reverse genetic screens. CRISPR has the ability to create libraries of thousands of precise genetic mutations and can identify new tumors as well as validate older tumors in cancer research. Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library targeting 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer. Bacterial CRISPR–Cas9 system for engineering both loss of function (LOF) and gain of function (GOF) mutations in untransformed human intestinal organoids in order to demonstrate a model of Colorectal cancer (CRC). It can also be used to study functional consequences of mutations in vivo by enabling direct genome editing in somatic cells.

== Mapping mutants ==

By the classical genetics approach, a researcher would then locate (map) the gene on its chromosome by crossbreeding with individuals that carry other unusual traits and collecting statistics on how frequently the two traits are inherited together. Classical geneticists would have used phenotypic traits to map the new mutant alleles. With the advent of genomic sequences for model systems such as &quot;Drosophila melanogaster,&quot; &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and &quot;C. elegans&quot; many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have now been identified that can be used as traits for mapping. In fact, the Heidelberg screen, allowing mass testing of mutants and developed in 1980 by Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, cleared the way for future scientists in this field. SNPs are the preferred traits for mapping since they are very frequent, on the order of one difference per 1000 base pairs, between different varieties of organism. Mutagens such as random DNA insertions by transformation or active transposons can also be used to generate new mutants. These techniques have the advantage of tagging the new alleles with a known molecular (DNA) marker that can facilitate the rapid identification of the gene.

== Positional cloning ==

Positional cloning is a method of gene identification in which a gene for a specific phenotype is identified only by its approximate chromosomal location (but not the function); this is known as the candidate region. Initially, the candidate region can be defined using techniques such as linkage analysis, and positional cloning is then used to narrow the candidate region until the gene and its mutations are found. Positional cloning typically involves the isolation of partially overlapping DNA segments from genomic libraries to progress along the chromosome toward a specific gene. During the course of positional cloning, one needs to determine whether the DNA segment currently under consideration is part of the gene.

Tests used for this purpose include cross-species hybridization, identification of unmethylated CpG islands, exon trapping, direct cDNA selection, computer analysis of DNA sequence, mutation screening in affected individuals, and tests of gene expression. For genomes in which the regions of genetic polymorphisms are known, positional cloning involves identifying polymorphisms that flank the mutation. This process requires that DNA fragments from the closest known genetic marker are progressively cloned and sequenced, getting closer to the mutant allele with each new clone. This process produces a contig map of the locus and is known as chromosome walking. With the completion of genome sequencing projects such as the Human Genome Project, modern positional cloning can use ready-made contigs from the genome sequence databases directly.

For each new DNA clone a polymorphism is identified and tested in the mapping population for its recombination frequency compared to the mutant phenotype. When the DNA clone is at or close to the mutant allele, the recombination frequency should be close to zero. If the chromosome walk proceeds through the mutant allele, the new polymorphisms will start to show increase in recombination frequency compared to the mutant phenotype. Depending on the size of the mapping population, the mutant allele can be narrowed down to a small region (&lt;30 Kb). Sequence comparison between wild type and mutant DNA in that region is then required to locate the DNA mutation that causes the phenotypic difference.

Modern positional cloning can more directly extract information from genomic sequencing projects and existing data by analyzing the genes in the candidate region. Potential disease genes from the candidate region can then be prioritized, potentially reducing the amount of work involved. Genes with expression patterns consistent with the disease phenotype, showing a (putative) function related to the phenotype, or homologous to another gene linked to the phenotype are all priority candidates. Generalization of positional cloning techniques in this manner is also known as positional gene discovery.

Positional cloning is an effective method to isolate disease genes in an unbiased manner and has been used to identify disease genes for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Huntington&#x27;s disease, and cystic fibrosis. However, complications in the analysis arise if the disease exhibits locus heterogeneity.

<text>Sebastião Ribeiro Salgado Júnior (born February 8, 1944) is a Brazilian social documentary photographer and photojournalist.

He has traveled in over 120 countries for his photographic projects. Most of these have appeared in numerous press publications and books. Touring exhibitions of his work have been presented throughout the world.

Salgado is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He was awarded the W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund Grant in 1982, Foreign Honorary Membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992 and the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) in 1993. He has been a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts at the Institut de France since April 2016.

==Early life and education==
Salgado was born on February 8, 1944, in Aimorés, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. After a somewhat itinerant childhood, Salgado trained as an economist, earning a BA degree from UFES, a master&#x27;s degree from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, and a PhD from University of Paris.

He began work as an economist for the International Coffee Organization, often traveling to Africa on missions for the World Bank.

==Photography==
It was on his travels to Africa that he first started seriously taking photographs. He chose to abandon a career as an economist and switched to photography in 1973, working initially on news assignments before veering more towards documentary-type work. Salgado initially worked with the photo agency Sygma and the Paris-based Gamma, but in 1979, he joined the international cooperative of photographers Magnum Photos. He left Magnum in 1994 and with his wife Lélia Wanick Salgado formed his own agency, Amazonas Images, in Paris, to represent his work. He is particularly noted for his social documentary photography of workers in less developed nations. His work resides in Paris.

Salgado works on long term, self-assigned projects, many of which have been published as books: &quot;The Other Americas&quot;, &quot;Sahel&quot;, &quot;Workers&quot;, &quot;Migrations&quot;, and &quot;Genesis&quot;. The latter three are mammoth collections with hundreds of images each from all around the world. His most famous pictures are of a gold mine in Brazil called Serra Pelada, taken between 1986 and 1989. He has also been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2001.

Between 2004 and 2011, Salgado worked on &quot;Genesis,&quot; aiming at the presentation of the unblemished faces of nature and humanity. It consists of a series of photographs of landscapes and wildlife, as well as of human communities that continue to live in accordance with their ancestral traditions and cultures. This body of work is conceived as a potential path to humanity&#x27;s rediscovery of itself in nature.

In September and October 2007, Salgado displayed his photographs of coffee workers from India, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Brazil at the Brazilian Embassy in London. The aim of the project was to raise public awareness of the origins of the popular drink.

Salgado has photographed the landscape and people of the Amazon rainforest (Amazónia) in Brazil.

Salgado&#x27;s work has been described by Andrei Netto of &quot;The Guardian&quot; as an &quot;instantly recognisable combination of black-and-white composition and dramatic lighting&quot;.

Salgado and his work are the focus of the film &quot;The Salt of the Earth&quot; (2014), directed by Wim Wenders and Salgado&#x27;s son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado, and produced by Lélia Wanick Salgado.

==Environmentalism==

Together, Lélia and Sebastião have worked since the 1990s on the restoration of a part of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil. In 1998, they succeeded in turning 17,000 acres into a nature reserve and created the Instituto Terra. The institute is dedicated to a mission of reforestation, conservation and environmental education.

<doc id="340955" wikidata="Q912043" url="?curid=340955" title="Jin (Chinese state)">
<text>Jin (, Old Chinese: &quot;&amp;ast;&quot;), originally known as Tang (唐), was a major state during the middle part of the Zhou dynasty, based near the centre of what was then China, on the lands attributed to the legendary Xia dynasty: the southern part of modern Shanxi. Although it grew in power during the Spring and Autumn period, its aristocratic structure saw it break apart when the duke lost power to his nobles. In 403BC, the Zhou court recognized Jin&#x27;s three successor states: Han, Zhao, and Wei. The Partition of Jin marks the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States period.

==Geography==
Jin was located in the lower Fen River drainage basin on the Shanxi plateau. To the north were the Xirong and Beidi peoples. To the west were the Lüliang Mountains and then the Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi. To the southwest the Fen River turns west to join the south-flowing part of the Yellow River which soon leads to the Guanzhong, an area of the Wei River Valley that was the heartland of the Western Zhou and later of the Qin. To the south are the Zhongtiao Mountains and then the east–west valley of the Yellow River which was the main route to the Wei Valley to the west. To the east were the Taihang Mountains and then the North China Plain. This location gave ambitious Jin dukes the opportunity to move north to conquer and absorb the Xirong tribes, move southwest to fight Qin, and move southeast to absorb the many smaller Zhou states.

Also important to the region were the large states of Chu to the south in the Yangtze and Huai River regions and Qi to the east in Shandong.

Jin had multiple capitals. The first capital of Jin was Tang (唐). The capital was later moved to E (), then Jiang (), then Xintian (新田). From 746 to 677 BC, Quwo (曲沃) was the capital of a fragment of Jin.

==Western Zhou (1046-771BC)==
When the Zhou Dynasty was founded, the conquered lands were given to Zhou relatives and ministers as hereditary fiefs. King Cheng of Zhou, the second Zhou king, gave the land called Tang (唐), west of modern Yicheng County in Shanxi, to his younger brother, Tang Shuyu (唐叔虞) with the rank of a marquis. Tang Shuyu&#x27;s son and successor, Marquis Xie of Jin (晉侯燮), changed the name of Tang to Jin. There is little information about Jin for this period beyond a list of rulers.

==Spring and Autumn period==
In 771BC the Quanrong nomads drove the Zhou out of the Wei River valley and killed the king. Marquis Wen of Jin, the eleventh marquis of Jin, supported King Ping of Zhou by killing his rival, King Xie of Zhou, an act that King Ping heavily rewarded him for.

===The breakaway state of Quwo (745-677BC)===
When Marquis Zhao of Jin (745-739BC) acceded to the throne, he gave the land of Quwo to his uncle Chengshi who became Huan Shu of Quwo. In 739BC, an official named Panfu (潘父) murdered Marquis Zhao and invited Huan Shu to take the throne. Huan Shu entered Jin but was driven out by the people and retreated to Quwo. All three Quwo rulers, Huan Shu (745–731), Zhuang Bo (731–716) and Duke Wu (716–678) made attempts to take over Jin. In 678BC, Duke Wu of Quwo conquered Jin and killed Marquis Min of Jin (704–678). One year later, after receiving gifts from Duke Wu, King Xi of Zhou made Duke Wu the legal ruler of Jin, who became known as Duke Wu of Jin (679–677).

===Ascendency===

With the establishment of the Quwo line, Jin became the most powerful state for three generations and remained powerful for a century or more after that. Duke Wu died soon after gaining control of Jin. He was followed by Duke Xian of Jin (676-651BC). Xian broke with Zhou feudalism by killing or exiling his cousins and ruling with appointees of various social backgrounds. He annexed 16 or 17 small states in Shanxi, dominated 38 others, and absorbed a number of Rong tribes. Some of the states conquered were Geng (耿), Huo (霍), old Wei (魏), Yu (虞) and Western Guo. His death led to a succession struggle which ended with the enthronement of Duke Hui of Jin (650–637). In 646BC, Duke Hui was captured by Qin and restored as a vassal.

Another son of Duke Xian was Duke Wen of Jin (636–628), who spent 19 years exile in various courts. He came to the throne in 636 escorted by the troops of his father-in-law, Duke Mu of Qin. Duke Wen quickly established himself as an independent ruler by driving the Di barbarians west of the Yellow River. In 635BC he supported King Xiang of Zhou against a rival and was rewarded with lands near the royal capital. In 633BC, he confronted the rising power of the southern state of Chu which was then besieging Song. Instead of directly assisting Song, he attacked two vassals of Chu, Cao and Wei. The following year, he formed a military alliance with Qin, Qi and Song that defeated Chu at the Battle of Chengpu, perhaps the largest battle in the Spring and Autumn period. Shortly after the battle, he held an interstate conference at Jitu (踐土) with King Xiang of Zhou and the rulers of six other states. He affirmed the lords&#x27; loyalty and received from the King the title of &quot;ba&quot; or hegemon. At some point, there was a war with Qin, which ended in peace. Duke Wen erected monuments to the fallen on both sides. The Chinese proverb &quot;The Friendship of Qin and Jin&quot;, meaning an unbreakable bond, dates from this period.

Over the next century, a four-way balance of power developed between Qin (west), Jin (west-center), Chu (south) and Qi (east), with a number of smaller states between Jin and Qi. In 627BC, Jin defeated Qin while it was attacking Zheng. Jin invaded Qin in 625BC and was driven back the following year. In 598BC, Chu defeated Jin at the Battle of Mi. In 589BC, Jin defeated Qi at the Battle of An, which had invaded Lu and Wey. About this time, Jin began to support the southeastern state of Wu as a means of weakening Chu. Duke Li of Jin (580–573) allied with Qin and Qi to make an east–west front against the threat of Chu from the south. In 579BC, a minister of the state of Song arranged a four-power conference in which the states agreed to limit their military strength. Four years later, fighting broke out again; Jin and its allies defeated Chu at the battle of Yingling. Duke Dao of Jin (572–558) strengthened the state by internal improvements rather than external wars. He absorbed a number of Rong tribes and was recognized as Hegemon.

===Decline and fall===
In 607BC, Duke Ling of Jin (620–607) was killed by Zhao Chuan (趙穿) under the orders of his uncle Zhao Dun. Prince Heitun was placed on the throne as Duke Cheng of Jin (606–600). This was the beginning of the slow shift of power from the Jin dukes to the ministerial clans. Duke Li of Jin (580–573), the grandson of Duke Cheng, tried to break the power of the clans by fostering conflicts between them. In 573BC, he was killed by the Luan (欒氏) and Zhonghang (中行氏) clans. Duke Dao of Jin (572–558) strengthened the ducal power, but could not eliminate the power of the other aristocratic families.

After the reign of Duke Zhao of Jin (531–526), the Jin dukes were figureheads and the state was controlled by six clans: Fan (范), Zhonghang (中行), Zhi (智), Han (韓), Zhao (趙) and Wei (魏).

The clans soon began to fight among themselves. During the time of Duke Ding of Jin (511–475), the Fan and Zhonghang clans were eliminated by Xiangzi of Zhi. By about 450BC, the Zhi were dominant and began demanding territory from the other clans. When Zhao resisted, Zhi attacked Zhao and brought along Han and Wei as allies. After a long siege at Taiyuan, Han and Wei switched sides and the three weaker clans annihilated the Zhi. They then divided the Zhi lands, as well as most of the rest of Jin, among themselves. When Duke You of Jin (433–416) came to the throne, the three clans had taken over much of the remaining Jin lands, leaving the dukes only the area around Jiang and Quwo. From then on, the three clans were known as the &quot;Three Jins&quot; (三晉).

In 403BC, during the reign of Duke Lie of Jin (415–389), King Weilie of Zhou recognized Marquis Jing of Han, Marquis Wen of Wei and Marquess Lie of Zhao, as marquises of Han in the south, Wei in the center and Zhao in the north, completing the partition of Jin. The state of Jin still nominally existed for several decades afterwards. The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; mentions that in the 20th year of Duke Huan&#x27;s reign (369 BC), Marquess Cheng of Zhao and Marquess Gong of Han moved Duke Huan to Tunliu, and after that there were no more records of Duke Huan or any other Jin ruler. Modern historians such as Yang Kuan, Ch&#x27;ien Mu, and Han Zhaoqi generally consider 369 BC the final year of Jin&#x27;s existence.

== Military forces ==
Jin united civil and military authority. Traditionally, Jin had three armies: the upper army, the central army and the lower army. Three more armies were added in 588 BC. Each army contained 12500 soldiers.

According to the convention of Zhou dynasty, a large fiefdom like Jin was allowed to have as many as three armies. However, Jin originally had only one army: the limitation was imposed by the Zhou dynasty king in order to observe the rite of Zhou. In 679 BCE, Duke Wu of Quwo assassinated Marquis Xiaozi of Jin and became the ruler of Jin. Quwo was a cadet branch of Jin&#x27;s ruling house; Ji clan descended from Shu Yu of Tang. The Zhou court, which regarded the lineal legitimacy as an extremely important matter, could not agree with such an usurpation. As a consequence, the king revoked Jin&#x27;s permission to have three armies.

In 661 BCE, Duke Xian of Jin lifted this prohibition by establishing the upper army; led by himself and the lower army; commanded by his son Shengshen. Jin&#x27;s central army was established in the year of 633 BCE by Duke Wen of Jin. In 634 BCE, Duke Wen additionally formed three &quot;ranks&quot; (三行) with the purpose of defending against a Beidi invasion. The three ranks were later redeployed into the &quot;New armies&quot; (新軍). The new armies were largely dependent on the actual military necessity instead of being permanent units. Due to their flexibility, the new armies were sometimes omitted.

According to Tang dynasty scholar Kong Yingda, The central army was the most prestigious army among Jin&#x27;s three armies. Its commander &quot;Zhongjunjiang&quot; (中軍將) also governs the state of Jin as &quot;Zhengqing&quot; (正卿)----Jin&#x27;s prime minister. Commander of the upper army (&quot;Shangjunjiang&quot;, 上軍將) and commander of the lower army (&quot;Xiajunjiang&quot;, 下軍將) did not have the access of political influence in Jin&#x27;s court and were merely military staffs. Every commander (&quot;Junjiang&quot;) of an Jin army was accompanied by a &quot;Junzuo&quot; (軍佐) who was the assistant of &quot;Junjiang&quot; (軍將). Other posts in the Jin army were &quot;Junsima&quot; (軍司馬) and &quot;Junwei&quot; (軍尉), both of which were subordinated under &quot;Junjiang&quot; and &quot;Junzuo&quot;.

=== Military ranks===

The main military ranks were:

*&quot;Zhongjunjiang&quot; (中軍將), also known as &quot;Yuanshuai&quot; (元帥), &quot;Jiangjun&quot; (將軍) and &quot;Zhengqing&quot;; Prime minister of Jin.
*&quot;Zhongjunzuo&quot; (中軍佐)
*&quot;Zhongjunwei&quot; (中軍尉), when the country is not at war, &quot;Zhongjunwei&quot; is in charge of the actual affairs of the central army.
*&quot;Shangjunjiang&quot; (上軍將)
*&quot;Shangjunzuo&quot; (上軍佐)
*&quot;Shangjunwei&quot; (上軍尉), when the country is not at war, &quot;Shangjunwei&quot; is in charge of the actual affairs of the upper army.
*&quot;Xiajunjiang&quot; (下軍將)
*&quot;Xiajunzuo&quot; (下軍佐)
*&quot;Zhongjunsima&quot; (中軍司馬)
*&quot;Shangjunsima&quot; (上軍司馬)

==Rulers==

List of Jin rulers based on the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; and the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;.

The original branch:
The Quwo branch, replacing the original branch in 678BC:
The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; (&quot;Shiji&quot;) also has another Duke Jing after Duke Xiao. However, &quot;Shiji&#x27;s&quot; account of the last rulers of Jin is often self-contradictory, and is further contradicted by the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, which does not mention any Jin ruler after Duke Huan of Jin. Historians such as Yang Kuan, Ch&#x27;ien Mu, and Han Zhaoqi generally regard the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; as more reliable, as it was unearthed from the tomb of King Xiang (died 296 BC) of the State of Wei, one of the three successor states of Jin. Duke Huan is therefore generally considered the final ruler of Jin.

== Later tradition ==

=== Claimed descendants ===
The Sui dynasty Emperors were from the northwest military aristocracy, and emphasized that their patrilineal ancestry was ethnic Han, claiming descent from the Han official Yang Zhen. and the New Book of Tang traced his patrilineal ancestry to the Zhou dynasty kings via Ji Boqiao (姬), who was the son of Duke Wu of Jin. Ji Boqiao&#x27;s family became known as the &quot;sheep tongue family&quot; ().
The Yang clan of Hongnong () were asserted as ancestors by the Sui Emperors like the Li clan of Longxi were asserted as ancestors of the Tang Emperors. The Li of Zhaojun and the Lu of Fanyang hailed from Shandong and were related to the Liu clan which was also linked to the Yang clan of Hongnong and other clans of Guanlong. Duke Wu of Jin was claimed as the ancestors of the Hongnong Yang.

The Yang clan of Hongnong, Jia clan of Hedong, Xiang clan of Henei, and Wang clan of Taiyuan from the Tang dynasty were claimed as ancestors by Song dynasty lineages.

There were Dukedoms for the offspring of the royal families of the Zhou dynasty, Sui dynasty, and Tang dynasty in the Later Jin (Five Dynasties).

=== Astrology ===
Jin is represented by the star 36 Capricorni (b Capricorni) in the asterism &quot;Twelve States&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot; mansion. Jin is also represented by the star Kappa Herculis in asterism &quot;Right Wall&quot;, Heavenly Market enclosure (see Chinese constellation).

<doc id="340958" wikidata="Q5523623" url="?curid=340958" title="Garner Ted Armstrong">
<text>Garner Ted Armstrong (February 9, 1930 – September 15, 2003) was an American evangelist and the son of Herbert W. Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God, at the time a Sabbatarian organization that taught observance of seventh-day Sabbath and annual Sabbath days based on Leviticus 23.

Armstrong initially became recognized when he succeeded his father as the voice of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;, the church&#x27;s radio program that aired around the world. A television program of the same name followed, aired mostly in North America, eventually giving way to a &quot;Garner Ted Armstrong&quot; broadcast, a half-hour program that mixed news and biblical commentary. His polemical message was unlike that of most other religious broadcasters of his day.

==Brief biography==
Armstrong&#x27;s genealogy is described in his father&#x27;s autobiography. The elder Armstrong reported that the Armstrong ancestors arrived in America in the late 17th century with William Penn. The ancestry was traced to Edward I of England. Armstrong&#x27;s grandmother was &quot;something like a third cousin to former President Herbert Hoover&quot;.

Armstrong was born in Portland, Oregon, to Loma Isabelle (Dillon) and Herbert W. Armstrong. He was raised in Eugene, Oregon, the youngest of four children. He was named for a great-grandmother on his mother&#x27;s side, Martha Garner, who was born in Suffolk, England, in 1841 and died in Iowa in 1923, seven years before he was born.

Following service in the United States Navy during the Korean War, Armstrong returned to Pasadena, California, where his father had moved the church&#x27;s operations in 1946. He was baptized in early 1953 (Origin and History, p. 36). He enrolled in Ambassador College, founded by his father and supported by the church. Ambassador was not regionally accredited, and Armstrong eventually completed bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in the only discipline offered, theology. He was ordained a minister in 1955 and held key administrative posts in both the Worldwide Church of God and Ambassador College until he was disfellowshipped (excommunicated) by his father in 1978. Prior to his removal, he was executive vice president of the church and president of the college and was widely considered to be heir-apparent to succeed his father as head of the church and its operations.

===Personality===

Armstrong was described as &quot;movie star handsome&quot; and was noted for his broadcasting talents. In radio and TV programs he mixed political, economic, and social news of the day with religious commentary. He was noted for adding &quot;wry humor&quot; into sermons that preached about the biblical prophesied return of Jesus Christ to the Earth.

In 1975, Garner Ted Armstrong arranged for his friend, Hee Haw co-host Buck Owens, to entertain attendees on Family Night at the annual fall Feast of Tabernacles church convention. Buck Owens and his band the Buckaroos traveled to five U.S. Feast of Tabernacles sites and performed before about 15,000 people. The concerts were attended by festival attendees and were also open to the general public.

To reciprocate, in 1976 Owens asked Armstrong to guest star on the &quot;Hee Haw&quot; show that starred Buck Owens and Roy Clark. He popped up out of the &quot;corn patch&quot; on the show to say &quot;Sa-loot&quot; to his hometown of Eugene, Oregon. He sang a country-western song he had written titled &quot;Working Man&#x27;s Hall of Fame&quot; and joined &quot;the whole Hee Haw gang&quot; to sing the popular Ocean gospel song Put Your Hand in the Hand.

Country music star Merle Haggard said that his most popular song &quot;Okie From Muskogee&quot; was inspired by listening to a Garner Ted Armstrong radio program of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;.

==Ministry==
Armstrong was ordained to the ministry by his father in 1955. G. T. Armstrong later reported in a sermon that he did not want to be a minister, to which his father answered something to the effect that his opposition to entering the ministry was a sign that he should. In 1957, he began to take over much of his father&#x27;s broadcasting responsibilities. During that same year, he traveled extensively through South America. As a fluent Spanish speaker, he made several Spanish-language broadcasts of the &quot;World Tomorrow&quot;.

The decade of the 1970s brought a series of reversals for Armstrong&#x27;s career, however. An article in the Los Angeles Times reported that &quot;The rift between the father and his heir apparent began in 1972 when Herbert Armstrong ousted his son from the church for four months, after an extra-marital affair, saying the son was &quot;in the bonds of Satan.&quot;

The year 1972 had been prominent in Herbert W. Armstrong&#x27;s prophetic views, as elaborated in a booklet called &quot;1975 in Prophecy!&quot;. January 1972 was supposed to be the conclusion of the second of two 19-year &quot;time cycles&quot; which, according to the elder Armstrong, had begun in 1953 when &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; began to be heard over Radio Luxembourg in Europe. According to his theory, at the conclusion of that second 19-year time cycle the members of the church were expected to flee to a place of refuge, which leading ministers had speculated could be the ancient city of Petra, carved into rock in Jordan. Following this flight, World War III supposedly would begin, with a United States of Europe rising up to overthrow both the United States of America and the United Kingdom. This fitted with both of the Armstrongs&#x27; teachings of a theory generally referred to as British Israelism, outlined in the elder Armstrong&#x27;s book &quot;The United States and Britain in Prophecy&quot;. When the church&#x27;s prophecies about 1972 and 1975 did not occur, Armstrong proposed dropping such an approach in favor of one centered on Christian living and an outline of church doctrines and practice.

Nevertheless, by 1977 Armstrong&#x27;s media exposure included a daily radio program broadcast on over 300 radio stations across the United States, 33 in Australia, and 11 in the Philippines, with other programs throughout the world rebroadcast in the German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Russian languages. With an annual television budget of six million dollars, his exposure also included television programs which appeared on up to 165 channels. For almost two years this included a daily television appearance. According to Armstrong, notables such as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Nelson Rockefeller, Cyrus Vance and Hubert Humphrey, as well as a number of U.S. senators, were frequent viewers of the broadcast. President Johnson personally told Armstrong during an afternoon lunch the two men had at Johnson&#x27;s Texas ranch, &quot;I watch your show (The World Tomorrow (radio and television)) all the time and I agree with most of what you have to say&quot;. Senator Bob Dole requested all copies of Armstrong&#x27;s 1970&#x27;s World Tomorrow broadcasts be preserved into the national archives of the Library of Congress TV &amp; Film division.

His establishment of a &quot;Systematic Theology Project&quot; was eventually jettisoned by his father, but a form of it was later adopted by a separate church that Armstrong later established.

===Relationship with Stanley R. Rader===
By the mid 1970s, Stanley Rader, an attorney and church accountant who had been a personal assistant to Herbert W. Armstrong since 1958, appeared to be stepping into the number two position of administration previously thought to be Armstrong&#x27;s domain. Relations between the two became strained and a power struggle ensued. One conflict was that Rader had set up privately owned affiliated corporations that were doing business with the church. Armstrong and others in the organization were skeptical of Rader&#x27;s legal and financial dealings and suspected a bid to control the church&#x27;s multimillion-dollar business. One objection to Rader&#x27;s role was that, being Jewish, he had never been a baptized member of the church or a practicing Christian. That obstacle was removed in 1975 when Rader was baptized by the elder Armstrong.

By the mid 1970s two different and rival views were developing regarding the work and future of the church.

One plan was formulated by Armstrong, who wanted to take the church in a direction built around a larger publishing and broadcasting platform that would go out under his name. Armstrong was wary of prophecies built around specific dates, and he was reported to be against the idea of continuing to deliver messages that associated the U.S. and Britain with the Lost Ten Tribes. He experimented with turning the church&#x27;s flagship magazine &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; into a tabloid-size newspaper in the style of the &quot;Christian Science Monitor.&quot; He envisioned a television broadcast along the lines of one that was later developed by the Christian Science Church, which created a short-lived nightly news program that was later seen on the Discovery Channel.

Meanwhile, Stanley Rader aided significantly in crafting a unique role for the senior Armstrong on the world stage: Herbert W. Armstrong was promoted to various governments as an &quot;ambassador without portfolio for world peace.&quot; In that role he did not so much represent the Worldwide Church of God or Ambassador College as he did a completely new entity called the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation (AICF). This foundation helped to finance the Tatum O&#x27;Neal motion picture &quot;Paper Moon&quot; and a new and slick commercial publication called &quot;Quest&quot;; bought Everest House, a publishing company; and turned the Ambassador Auditorium, located on the college campus in Pasadena, into a performing arts venue that boasted an annual subscription series featuring world-renowned performers and celebrities from stage, screen and the recording arts. Gifts from the foundation helped Rader secure audiences with world leaders for the elder Armstrong, whose message was less an overt Christian one than a more general one about peace, brotherly love, giving instead of getting, and a &quot;great unseen hand from someplace&quot; intervening in world affairs.

Armstrong was known to disagree with this approach as well as the expenditure of funds on it and other foundation activities. It became an increasing point of division between father and son.

In 1977, he officiated at the wedding of his father to the former Ramona Martin. The two separated in 1982 and divorced in 1984.

===Father and son part ways===
As Rader&#x27;s influence with the elder Armstrong grew, so did the gap between Armstrong and his father over operations and certain doctrinal positions of the church. In 1978 Herbert Armstrong excommunicated his son and fired him from all roles in the church and college on the night of Wednesday, June 28, 1978, by means of a phone call to Tyler, Texas. Armstrong moved to Tyler, Texas, where he founded the Church of God International and the Armstrong Evangelistic Association, through which he soon returned to the television airwaves.

Armstrong never again had the media outreach that he had enjoyed in his father&#x27;s organization, nor did his new church ever rival his father&#x27;s in membership statistics. The Church of God International did, however, become a haven for some former members of the Pasadena church who took exception to Rader&#x27;s role and/or the elder Armstrong&#x27;s autocratic style. As a result, members of the Worldwide Church of God were forbidden by Herbert Armstrong from having any contact with Armstrong, and his name was removed from a significant number of church publications. At the time of the separation, he was one of the Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God.

However, in his later years, Armstrong&#x27;s relationship with the Worldwide Church of God was somewhat cordial. Armstrong and his family were invited to stay on the Ambassador campus in Pasadena during the time of his father&#x27;s funeral. He returned to the Big Sandy campus in 1986 for the funeral of Norval Pyle, an early Worldwide Church of God pioneer. In the spring of 1997, shortly before the university closed, he was interviewed by a staff writer from the Ambassador University student newspaper. Finally, the church archivist sent him several family heirlooms that were held in the Worldwide Church of God&#x27;s possession following his father&#x27;s death.

==Later ministry==
He continued his ministry through the Church of God International (CGI) in the years that followed. Meanwhile, he appeared on both the John Ankerberg Show and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

He continued to conduct personal appearance campaigns throughout the United States, Australia, Jamaica, and Canada, but on a much smaller scale than during his heyday in the 1970s. The appearances also provided opportunities for unofficial reunions between those who had left and those who remained in the Worldwide Church of God.

In the fall of 1989, he travelled to Berlin to do on-the-spot radio broadcasts covering the fall of the Berlin Wall.

In 1997, following accusations by a masseuse named Sue Rae Robertson, Armstrong was asked to resign as leader of the CGI, but to remain a laymember, by the church&#x27;s board of directors. No charges were ever filed in relation to the alleged assault, and civil cases brought against Armstrong and the CGI were dismissed. Instead, Armstrong chose to resign from CGI altogether and founded the Intercontinental Church of God.

Until his death, he was the head of his Armstrong Evangelistic Association, which he had established in 1978, and the Intercontinental Church of God.

==Death and legacy==
Armstrong died on September 15, 2003, owing to complications from pneumonia. He was buried in Gladewater Memorial Park, approximately two miles east of the former Big Sandy, Texas, campus of Ambassador University. He is buried with his wife and her family: his father-in-law Roy Hammer, his mother-in-law Pearl Hammer, and several other members of the Hammer family. His parents, paternal grandmother, and brother are buried in Altadena, California. The Hammers were the donors of the original property on which the Ambassador campus was located. His widow, Shirley, died in 2014.

Rather than selecting a new media spokesman, the evangelistic association continues to broadcast old programs made by Armstrong on approximately 30 television stations and cable outlets according to the Armstrong TV/Radio Page of the ministry&#x27;s website. The Intercontinental Church of God (United States) and Garner Ted Armstrong Evangelistic Association are now led by Mark Armstrong, who functions as CEO of the organizations and producer of the television outreach program.

<doc id="340959" wikidata="Q78351" url="?curid=340959" title="Johannes Junius">
<text>Johannes Junius (1573 – 6 August 1628) was the mayor (German: &quot;Bürgermeister&quot;) of Bamberg, and a victim of the Bamberg witch trials, who wrote a letter to his daughter from jail while he awaited execution for witchcraft.

==Arrest==
Junius had first entered local politics in 1608 and had held the title of burgomaster in the years 1614, 1617, and 1621, and from the years 1624 to 1628. The Bamberg witch trials, which lasted from 1626 to 1631, were presided over by Prince-Bishop Johann Georg, who was dedicated to spreading the Counter-Reformation. There had been suspicion of Junius being a witch due to his wife having been executed for witchcraft. Another &quot;bürgermeister&quot;, Georg Neudecker had been accused of witchcraft and, following his imprisonment in April 1628, named Junius as an accomplice, leading to his arrest in June 1628. Junius was also implicated in the confessions of other suspected witches. Court documents describe how Junius at first denied all charges and demanded to confront his witnesses, and continued to deny his involvement in witchcraft after weeks of torture, which included the application of thumbscrews, leg vises (&quot;Beinschrauben&quot;), and strappado. He finally confessed on July 5, 1628, in which he claimed that he had renounced God for the Devil and that he had seen twenty-seven of his colleagues at a sabbat. Junius was publicly burned to death one month later.

==Confession==
In his confession, Junius relates that in 1624, while in a difficult financial state, he was seduced by a woman who later proved to be a succubus and threatened to kill him unless he renounced God. At first Junius refused, but soon more demons materialised and attacked him further, finally convincing him to accept the Devil as his God. He took the witch-name of Krix and was provided with a familiar named &quot;Füchsin&quot; (&quot;Vixen&quot;), at which point several local townsfolk revealed themselves as similarly allied with Satan and congratulated him. Thereafter he regularly attended witch&#x27;s sabbats, to which he rode on the back of a monstrous, flying black dog. At one such sabbat he attended a Black Mass at which Beelzebub made an appearance. Although his fellow witches and familiar demons had commanded him to kill his children in their name, he had been unable to perform this sacrifice, for which he was beaten. However, he did admit to having sacrificed his horse and burying a sacred wafer.

==Letter to daughter==
On July 24, shortly before his execution, Junius managed to write a letter to his daughter, Veronica, which was smuggled out of jail by his guard and successfully delivered. In the letter he defends his innocence, claims that those who testified against him have secretly begged his forgiveness, and recounts the abject horror of his torture (inflicted upon him by his brother-in-law and three others), from which his hands still shake at the time of writing the letter. He also says that at first he attempted to create a confession in which he could not identify the other witches, but was forced to name names under threat of further torture. The letter begins: &quot;Many hundred thousand good-nights, dearly beloved daughter Veronica,&quot; and ends &quot;Good night, for your father Johannes Junius will see you no more.&quot;

===Full contents of letter===
&quot;Many hundred thousand good-nights, dearly beloved daughter Veronica. Innocent have I come into prison, innocent have I been tortured, innocent must I die. For whoever comes into the witch prison must become a witch or be tortured until he invents something out of his head and - God pity him- bethinks him of something. I will tell you how it has gone with me. When I was the first time put to the torture, Dr. Braun, Dr. Kotzendorffer, and two strange doctors were there. Then Dr. Braun, asks me, &quot;Kinsman, how come you here?&quot;, I answer, &quot;Through falsehood, through misfortune.&quot; &quot;Hear, you,&quot; he says, &quot;you are a witch; will you confess it voluntarily? If not, we&#x27;ll bring in witnesses and the executioner for you.&quot; I said &quot;I am no witch, I have a pure conscience in the matter; if there are a thousand witnesses, I am not anxious, but I&#x27;ll gladly hear the witnesses.&quot; Now the chancellor&#x27;s son was set before me ... and afterward Hoppfen Elss. She had seen me dance on Haupts-moor ... I answered: &quot;I have never renounced God, and will never do it- God graciously keep me from it. I&#x27;ll rather bear whatever I must.&quot; And then came also- God in highest Heaven have mercy- the executioner, and put the thumb-screws on me, both hands bound together, so that the blood ran out at the nails and everywhere, so that for four weeks I could not use my hands, as you can see from the writing ... Thereafter they first stripped me, bound my hands behind me, and drew me up in the torture. Then I thought heaven and earth were at an end; eight times did they draw me up and let me fall again, so that I suffered terrible agony ...

&quot;And this happened on Friday, June 30, and with God&#x27;s help I had to bear the torture. When at last the executioner led me back into the prison, he said to me: &quot;Sir, I beg you, for God&#x27;s sake confess something, for you cannot endure the torture which you will be put to; and even if you bear it all, yet you will not escape, not even if you were an earl, but one torture will follow after another until you say you are a witch. Not before that,&quot; he said, &quot;will they let you go, as you may see by all their trials, for one is just like another&quot; ... And so I begged, since I was in a wretched plight, to be given one day for thought and a priest. The priest was refused me, but the time for thought was given. Now, my dear child, see what hazard I stood and still stand. I must say that I am a witch, though I am not, - must now renounce God, though I have never done it before Day and night I was deeply troubled, but a last there came to me a new idea. I would not be anxious, but, since I had been given no priest with whom I could take counsel, I would myself think of something and say it. It were surely better that I just say it with mouth and words, even though I had not really done it&#x27;; and afterwards I would confess it to the priest, and let those answer for it who compel me to do it. ... And so I made my confession, as follows; but it was all a lie.&quot;

&quot;Now follows, dear child, what I confessed in order to escape the great anguish and bitter torture, which it was impossible for me longer to bear. ... Then I had to tell what people I had seen [at the witch-sabbath]. I said that I had not recognized them. &quot;You old rascal, I must set the executioner at you. Say- was not the Chancellor there?&quot; So I said yes. &quot;Who besides?&quot; I had not recognized anybody. So he said: &quot;Take one street after another; begin at the market, go out on one street and back on the next.&quot; I had to name several persons there. Then came the long street. I knew nobody. Had to name eight persons there. Then the Zinkenwert- one person more. Then over the upper bridge to the Georgthor, on both sides. Knew nobody again. Did I know nobody in the castle- whoever it might be, I should speak without fear. And thus continuously they asked me on all the streets, though I could not and would not say more. So they gave me to the executioner, told him to strip me, shave me all over, and put me to the torture. &quot;The rascal knows one on the market-place, is with him daily, and yet won&#x27;t know him.&quot; By that they meant Dietmery: so I had to name him too.&quot;

&quot;Then I had to tell what crimes I had committed. I said nothing. ...&quot;Draw the rascal up!&quot; So I said that I was to kill my children, but I had killed a horse instead. It did not help. I had also taken a sacred wafer, and had desecrated it. When I had said this, they left me in peace.&quot;

&quot;Now dear child, here you have all my confession, for which I must die. And they are sheer lies and made-up things, so help me God. For all this I was forced to say through fear of the torture which was threatened beyond what I had already endured. For they never leave off with the torture till one confesses something; be he never so good, he must be a witch. Nobody escapes, though he were an earl. ...&quot;

&quot;Dear child, keep this letter secret so that people do not find it, else I shall be tortured most piteously and the jailers will be beheaded. So strictly is it forbidden. ...Dear child, pay this man a dollar... I have taken several days to write this: my hands are both lame. I am in a sad plight. ... Good night, for your father Johannes Junius will never see you more. July 24, 1628.&quot;

[And on the margin of the letter he added: &quot;Dear child, six have confessed against me at once: the Chancellor, his son, Neudecker, Zaner, Hoffmaisters Ursel, and Hoppfen Else - all false, through compulsion, as they have all told me, and begged my forgiveness in God&#x27;s name before they were executed. ... They know nothing but good of me. They were forced to say it, just as I myself was.&quot;]

<text>The Agricultural Wheel was a cooperative alliance of farmers in the United States. It was established in 1882 in Arkansas. A major founding organizers of the Agricultural Wheel was W. W. Tedford, an Arkansas farmer and school teacher. Like similar farmer organizations such as the Southern Farmers&#x27; Alliance, the Louisiana Farmers&#x27; Union, and the Brothers of Freedom, the Agricultural Wheel had been formed to expose and correct the injustices and oppressions done to the small farmers by merchants, grain elevators and the railroads. The Wheel promoted a radical agenda including currency expansion through free silver; closing all national banks; regulation or nationalization of the railroads, the telephones and the telegraph; allow only Americans to purchase public lands; impose an income tax on high incomes; and elect senators by popular election instead of by state legislatures. The Wheel encouraged farmers to join local cooperatives, avoid the debt cycle, and avoid one crop overemphasis on cotton.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
On February 15, 1882, during a period of depressed farm prices and drought, a group of nine Arkansas farmers led by W. W. Tedford, W. A. Suit and W. Taylor McBee met at the McBee Schoolhouse eight miles south of Des Arc in Prairie County in eastern Arkansas and formed the &quot;Wattensas Farmers&#x27; Club&quot;. The club vowed to improve the lives of farmers, improve their education and knowledge, and improve communications between them. Many Arkansas farmers were suffering under what they viewed as oppressive mortgages (known as anaconda mortgages) and were heavily in debt. The Wheel&#x27;s early platform reflected the prior work of The Grange, an earlier agricultural organization supporting producerism who had largely faded by 1882.

Within a short time it was suggested that the organization change its name. The choices were between &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Friend&quot; and &quot;The Agricultural Wheel&quot; which was the name finally selected.

The situation did not improve in Arkansas that year and farmers were in such desperate straits that they called upon Governor of Arkansas Thomas J. Churchill to ask the legislature to postpone the collection of taxes.

By 1883 the organization consisted of over 500 members in Arkansas. At the organization&#x27;s meeting in the spring a state Wheel was established and deputies were appointed to spread the word to neighboring states and seek to establish local wheels in those states. The Wheel was limited to white male farmers and mechanics engaged in agriculture.

===Brothers of Freedom===
In 1882, a separate but similar organization, known as the Brothers of Freedom was formed in Johnson County, Arkansas also seeking to increase the economic power of small farmers in opposition to monopolists and big business. One of the founders was Isaac McCracken, a farmer and former machinist and who had experience with labor unions in the Northern United States, including a membership in the Knights of Labor. Over time, the organization grew to attract former Grange and Greenback Party members in a sixteen-county area of northwestern Arkansas, where the rocky soil and hills was not conducive to cotton farming.

In October 1885 the Wheel absorbed the Brothers of Freedom by a vote of both organizations, becoming official in July 1886. McCracken would become president of the Wheel in 1886.

===National organization===
In 1886 delegates from Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee gathered at the town of Litchfield, Arkansas, to establish the &quot;National Agricultural Wheel&quot; and an official newspaper for the organization. The national organization allowed women into the organization, and the establishment of segregated Wheel lodges for non-white Wheelers, though members could attend white Wheel meetings as &quot;guests&quot;. Among farmers&#x27; organizations of the period the Wheel was remarkable for refusal to hold racially segregated meetings, a policy it held until merger with the Farmers&#x27; Alliance.

By the time of the 1887 meeting, the membership of the national organization was over 500,000 farmers from Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Indian Territory, and Wisconsin. 

The growing political clout of the organization led it to promulgate a platform consisting of the following demands: 

* Paying off the national debt
* Repeal of laws that favored capital over labor
* Preventing aliens from owning land
* Abolishing national banks
* Government operations on a cash basis
* Ending of agricultural futures trading
* Establishing a graduated income tax
* Prohibiting importation of foreign labor
* National ownership of transportation and communication
* Direct election of national politicians
* Free trade and removal of all import duties
* Establishment of a luxury tax
* Free public education
* No renewal of patents

In 1888 at the national meeting in Meridian, Mississippi a merger between the Wheel and the Farmers&#x27; Alliance was proposed. The two organizations met jointly in 1889 in Birmingham, Alabama and merged that same year.

==Merger==
Centered largely in the state of Arkansas the Agricultural Wheel sought association with other farm protest organizations outside the state. Merger talks had begun as early as 1887 between these protest groups. Besides the similarity of their political goals the Agricultural Wheel and the other farm protest organization shared the same organizational structure. The Agricultural Wheel and the other farm protest organizations anticipating merger were organized on the basis of small clubs of farmers organized at the neighborhood level. Even organization at the county level had proved to be impractical. County level organization was too large and not &quot;local enough.&quot; In the 1880s, small farmers rarely journeyed to the county seat of their home counties. The Agricultural Wheel continued to exist as a separate organization until 1889 when it merged with the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance to form the Farmers&#x27; and Laborers&#x27; Union of America.

Historian Theodore Saloutos wrote that:
: the Agricultural Wheel was a protest against the effects of the Civil War and Reconstruction, the difficulties of a pioneer, primitive, sparsely-settled community attempting to adapt itself to a small-scale commercialized state of agriculture, the effects of one-crop farming, the share and crop-lean systems, lawlessness, and corruption in &quot;high places.&quot;

<text>Aslan (Khalid) Aliyevich Maskhadov () was a Soviet and Chechen politician and military commander who was the third president of the unrecognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.

He was credited by many with the Chechen victory in the First Chechen War, which allowed for the establishment of the &quot;de facto&quot; independent Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Maskhadov was elected President of Chechnya in January 1997. Following the start of the Second Chechen War in August 1999, he returned to leading the guerrilla resistance against the Russian army. De facto Ichkeria ceased to exist at the beginning of 2000. Until his death, Maskhadov was President in exile. He was killed in Tolstoy-Yurt, a village in northern Chechnya, in March 2005.

==Biography==
===Early life===
On 21 September 1951, Aslan Aliyevich Maskhadov was born in Karaganda Region of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) of the Soviet Union, in the small village of Shakai, during the mass deportation of the Chechen people ordered in 1944 by Joseph Stalin. His family was from the Alaroy teip (of the Alkhan nek&#x27;e branch). In 1957, his family returned to Chechnya, where they settled in Zebir-Yurt, Nadterechny District.

Maskhadov joined the Soviet Army, trained in the neighbouring Georgian SSR and graduated from the Tbilisi Artillery School in 1972. He then graduated with honours from the Leningrad Kalinin Higher Artillery in 1981. He was posted to Hungary with a self-propelled artillery regiment until 1986 and then from 1986 in the Baltic Military District. He served from 1990 as the chief of staff of Soviet missile and artillery forces in Vilnius, capital of the Lithuanian SSR. In January 1991, Maskhadov participated in the January Events, the seizure of the television tower by Soviet troops (which he regretted later), but didn&#x27;t participate in the assault itself. During his service in the Soviet Army, he was presented with two Orders For Service to Homeland. Maskhadov retired from the Soviet Army in 1992 with the rank of a colonel and returned to his native land. He was at the head of ChRI civil defence from late 1992 to November 1993.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in the summer of 1993, Maskhadov took part in raids on the armed opposition against the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev in the Urus-Martan, Nadterechny, and Gudermes districts. An unsuccessful anti-Dudayev mutiny in November 1993 resulted in the dismissal of Viskhan Shakhabov as chief of staff of the Chechen armed forces, Maskhadov was appointed as the acting chief of staff and, in March 1994, as the chief of staff.

===First Chechen War===

In December 1994, when the First Chechen War broke out, he was the senior military figure on the Chechen side during the war and was widely seen as being instrumental to the Chechen victory over the Russian forces. As the First Deputy Chairman of the ChRI State Defence Council (ChRI President Dudayev was the chairman) and the chief of staff, Maskhadov organised defence of the Chechen capital during the Battle of Grozny. Maskhadov commanded the city from the Presidential Palace in Grozny, where on one occasion a Russian bunker buster bomb landed 20 meters from him but failed to explode. In February 1995, Dudayev promoted Aslan to divisional general.

Beginning in June 1995, Maskhadov took part in peace talks in Grozny to resolve the crisis in Chechnya. In June 1996, at the negotiations in Nazran, Ingushetia, Maskhadov, on behalf of the ChRI administration, signed the Protocol of the Commission&#x27;s Meeting on Ceasefire and Measures to Resolve the Armed Conflict in the CRI. In August 1996, after Grozny&#x27;s seizure by Chechen units he repeatedly held talks with Alexander Lebed and on 31 August 1996, the signing of the Khasav-Yurt Accord took place, a ceasefire agreement, and peace treaty which marked the end of the First Chechen War. 

===President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria===

On 17 October 1996, Maskhadov was appointed Prime Minister of Ichkeria, while he also remained chief of staff and defence minister. 

Running with Vakha Arsanov, who became his vice president, Mashkadov won a majority of 60% of the votes and was congratulated by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who pledged to work towards rebuilding relations with Chechnya. Maskhadov was inaugurated on 12 February 1997, and at the same time he assumed the office of prime minister and abolished the office of Defence Minister he had occupied since late 1996. Maskhadov remained commander-in-chief of the republican armed forces. On 12 May 1997, Maskhadov then attained the apex of his political career when he signed a peace treaty with Yeltsin at the Kremlin.

By the end of 1996, when Maskhadov assumed his office, nearly half a million people (40% of Chechya prewar population) had been internally displaced and lived in refugee camps or overcrowded villages. The economy was destroyed and the warlords had no intention to disband their militias. Under such circumstances, Maskhadov&#x27;s political fortunes began to wane. His political standing within Chechnya became increasingly insecure as he lost control to Basayev and other warlords. Even his Vice-President Arsanov became his political enemy. Just like in the years before the First Chechen War under Dudayev, the years of Chechen independence were notorious for organized crime, including kidnapping, leading to several public executions of criminals.

Maskhadov attempted with only limited success to curb the growth of Wahhabism and other fundamentalist Muslim groups supported by Basayev, producing a split in the Chechen separatist movement between Islamic fundamentalism and secular Chechen nationalists. In February 1999, as a concession to radical Islamists, Maskhadov introduced Islamic Sharia law. The Sharia courts that were established sentenced people to death, flogging, executing people for crimes such as adultery.

Maskhadov survived assassination attempts on his life three times, on 23 July 1998 and 21 March and 10 April in 1999, in which the attackers used anti-tank missiles and bombs. Russian secret services were officially blamed.

===Second Chechen War===

In the summer of 1999, Maskhadov condemned an attempt by Basayev and Ibn Al-Khattab to spread war to the neighboring republic of Dagestan (known as the Invasion of Dagestan). This raid, and the Russian apartment bombings, were both blamed on the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. On 1 October 1999, the then Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared the authority of President Maskhadov and his parliament illegitimate. Putin sent Russian forces into Chechnya, and his promise of a quick and decisive victory propelled him to the Russian Presidency.

On 11 October 1999, Maskhadov outlined a peace plan offering a crackdown on renegade warlords, the offer was rejected by the Russian side. In response, President Maskhadov declared a &quot;gazavat&quot; (holy war) to confront the approaching Russian army. 

Maskhadov was one of the main commanders in the Battle of Grozny (1999–2000) along with Shamil Basayev, Ruslan Gelayev, Ibn Al-Khattab, Aslambek Ismailov, and Khunkarpasha Israpilov. Maskhadov along with his men launched daring counter-attacks against the Russian troops while fighting in Grozny and also effectively used the sewer systems to attack Russian troops from behind. After a meeting with top rebel commanders, Maskhadov and others agreed to withdraw from Grozny and continue to attack Russian forces in the cities and towns surrounding the city. Maskhadov was the first to withdraw because of his importance to the rebel cause and because he was the official President of Chechnya. As Maskhadov and his men retreated, they set up a vast amount of booby traps and landmines to hinder Russian forces and make most of Grozny impassable.

After Chechen forces&#x27; withdrawal from Grozny following another battle for the city, Maskhadov returned to a life of a guerrilla leader, living in hiding as Russia&#x27;s second most wanted man after Basayev, with Russia placing a $10 million bounty on his capture. He was seen as the official political leader of the separatist forces during the war, but it is unclear what kind of a military role he played. Maskhadov offered his readiness for unconditional peace talks with Moscow several times in 2000 alone, continuing in the following years, but his appeals for a political solution were always ignored by the Russian side.

Maskhadov advocated armed resistance to what he saw as a Russian occupation of Chechnya but condemned attacks on civilians. He allegedly supported the assassination of pro-Russian Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov in Chechnya, whilst condemning the Russian assassination of Chechen separatist ex-President Yandarbiyev in Qatar in 2004. Maskhadov often denied responsibility for the increasingly brutal terrorist acts against Russian civilians by Basayev&#x27;s followers, continually issuing denunciations of such incidents through spokesmen abroad, such as Akhmed Zakayev in London. However, on 24 October 2002, radio communications were intercepted from Maskhadov&#x27;s messages wherein he called for intensification of terrorist activities and sabotage in Russian territory. Evidence for Maskhadov&#x27;s complicity in the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis was provided by its two principal perpetrators, Movsar Barayev and Abu Said. Although he initially denied responsibility for the 2004 Nazran raid, in which 98 police officers/troops were killed, in July 2004 Maskhadov publicly accepted responsibility for the attacks. In the same month, Maskahdov promised similar attacks would happen, and vowed that the winner of Chechnya&#x27;s upcoming presidential election would be illegitimate and would be attacked if necessary. He described the rebels behind the Beslan school siege as &quot;madmen&quot; driven out of their senses by Russian acts of brutality and called the terrorist attack an atrocity.

On 15 January 2005, Maskhadov issued a special order to stop all military operations except those in self-defense, both inside and outside Chechnya, until the end of February (the date marking the anniversary of the Stalin&#x27;s Vainakh deportations of 1944) as a gesture of good will, and again called for a negotiated end to the Chechen conflict. Umar Khambiev, his designated negotiator, said that the separatists were no longer seeking independence, but only &quot;guarantees for the existence of the Chechen nation&quot;. This surprise, unilateral ceasefire was supported by Basayev but flatly rejected by the Russian and pro-Russian leaders who, once again, refused to negotiate. Maskhadov&#x27;s order to temporarily cease all offensive actions was largely followed by the rebel movement, except in Dagestan.

===Death===
As of 2005, different versions of Maskhadov’s death existed. According to an official one announced on 8 March 2005 by the head of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) Nikolai Patrushev, less than a month after Maskhadov announced the cease-fire, a special forces unit of FSB had:&quot;… carried out an operation in the settlement of Tolstoy-Yurt, as a result of which the international jihadist and leader of armed groups Maskhadov was killed, and his closest comrades-in-arms detained.&quot;He said the special operations unit had intended to capture Maskhadov alive for interrogation but killed him accidentally with a grenade thrown into a bunker where Maskhadov was hiding.

Akhmed Zakayev, one of his closest allies who acted as his spokesman and foreign minister, told a Russian radio station that it was probable that Maskhadov had indeed been killed; he indicated later that a new Chechen leader could be chosen within days. Vladimir Putin awarded those responsible for the assassinations with medals. Shortly after Maskhadov&#x27;s death, the Chechen rebel council announced that Abdul-Halim Sadulayev had assumed the leadership.

Four Chechens, Vakhit Murdashev, Viskhan Hadzhimuradov, Skanarbek Yusupov, and Ilias Iriskhanov, were captured in the raid. According to ballistic evidence at their trial in the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic, Maskhadov was allegedly killed by a shot from the pistol of Viskhan Hadzhimuradov, his nephew and bodyguard. Hadzhimuradov, however, had testified that he does not remember whether he shot Maskhadov or not since he was stunned by an explosion but after the capture, Hadzhimuradov reportedly said: &quot;My uncle always told me to shoot him if he is wounded and his capture is imminent. He said that if he is taken prisoner, he would be mistreated like Saddam Hussein had been&quot;.

A year later in 2006, a son of Maskhadov, Anzor, in an interview with Caucasian Knot allegedly claimed that his father was tracked down by a phone IMEI within 2 days before the raid took place. He was found in a hideout (an underground bunker) of one of his relative&#x27;s buildings. Shortly after a standoff with Russian special forces he fired his hand weapon and then hit by a stun grenade and then shot dead. He also expressed the belief that special forces intended to take him alive but failed.

==Unmarked grave==
On 24 April 2006, the General Procurator&#x27;s Office of Russia refused to return Maskhadov&#x27;s body to his relatives for burial. The refusal was described as legal: Maskhadov A. A., in connection with terrorism, was criminally responsible for many separate serious crimes on the territory of the Russian Federation. Taking this into account, it was decided to suppress Maskhadov&#x27;s activities and Maskhadov was being pursued for our protection. The burial of such persons is carried out in accordance with the rules concerning the burial of those whose death was a result of the suppression of their terrorist actions, affirmed by the government of the Russian Federation on 20 March 2003, in Order No. 164. In this case, the body is not handed over for burial, and the location of the burial is not communicated.

Maskhadov&#x27;s family has been campaigning for the release of his remains or a disclosure of what happened to his body. In 2006, they lodged a complaint to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on &quot;illegal&quot; refusal by Russian authorities at the time to return Maskhadov&#x27;s body back to the family.

==Family life==
He married at the age of 17. His wife Kusama holds a graduate degree in teaching. They had two children: a son, who took part in military action during the First Russian-Chechen War, and a daughter.

<text>John Stein is a jazz guitarist and teacher from Kansas City, Missouri.

==Career==
A native of Kansas City, Missouri, Stein took his first guitar lesson when he was seven and his first jazz lesson when he was thirteen. In 1967, he attended Beloit College, but he dropped out and moved to Vermont. He worked in local clubs playing rock music, then took jazz lessons from a pianist. When he was thirty, he attended the Berklee College of Music and taught there after he graduated. He received a master&#x27;s degree in education from Harvard and also plays double bass. His first album, &quot;Hustle Up!&quot;, was released in 1995. 

Stein considers Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall his two biggest influences. One of his favorite albums since childhood is &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;, released in 1964 by Stan Getz, João Gilberto, and Antônio Carlos Jobim. He recorded his album &quot;Concerto Internacional de Jazz&quot; (2006) in Brazil. In 2005, he made his public debut as bandleader with David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman.

For several years, Stein wrote a column for &quot;Just Jazz Guitar&quot; magazine about arranging and composing. Some of this material was compiled for his books &quot;Jazz Standards for Solo Guitar&quot;, &quot;Composing Tunes for Jazz Performance&quot;, and &quot;Composing Blues for Jazz Performance&quot;.

He has worked with Bill Pierce, John LaPorta, David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman, Larry Goldings, and Bob Freedman. He has performed on stage with David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman, Lou Donaldson, Lonnie Smith, Johnny Vidacovich, and Idris Muhammad. He toured France, Germany, Switzerland, Brazil, Spain, and the U.S.

<doc id="340982" wikidata="Q163082" url="?curid=340982" title="Petrology">
<text>Petrology () is the branch of geology that studies rocks, their mineralogy, composition, texture, structure and the conditions under which they form. Petrology has three subdivisions: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary petrology. Igneous and metamorphic petrology are commonly taught together because both make heavy use of chemistry, chemical methods, and phase diagrams. Sedimentary petrology is commonly taught together with stratigraphy because it deals with the processes that form sedimentary rock. Modern sedimentary petrology is making increasing use of chemistry.

== Background ==
Lithology was once approximately synonymous with petrography, but in current usage, lithology focuses on macroscopic hand-sample or outcrop-scale description of rocks while petrography is the speciality that deals with microscopic details.

In the petroleum industry, lithology, or more specifically mud logging, is the graphic representation of geological formations being drilled through and drawn on a log called a mud log. As the cuttings are circulated out of the borehole, they are sampled, examined (typically under a 10× microscope) and tested chemically when needed.

==Methodology==

Petrology utilizes the fields of mineralogy, petrography, optical mineralogy, and chemical analysis to describe the composition and texture of rocks. Petrologists also include the principles of geochemistry and geophysics through the study of geochemical trends and cycles and the use of thermodynamic data and experiments in order to better understand the origins of rocks.

== Branches ==
There are three branches of petrology, corresponding to the three types of rocks: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary, and another dealing with experimental techniques:

*Igneous petrology focuses on the composition and texture of igneous rocks (rocks such as granite or basalt which have crystallized from molten rock or magma). Igneous rocks include volcanic and plutonic rocks.
*Sedimentary petrology focuses on the composition and texture of sedimentary rocks (rocks such as sandstone, shale, or limestone which consist of pieces or particles derived from other rocks or biological or chemical deposits, and are usually bound together in a matrix of finer material).
*Metamorphic petrology focuses on the composition and texture of metamorphic rocks (rocks such as slate, marble, gneiss, or schist) which have undergone chemical, mineralogical or textural changes due to the effects of pressure, temperature, or both). The original rock, prior to change (called the protolith), may be of any sort.
*Experimental petrology employs high-pressure, high-temperature apparatus to investigate the geochemistry and phase relations of natural or synthetic materials at elevated pressures and temperatures. Experiments are particularly useful for investigating rocks of the lower crust and upper mantle that rarely survive the journey to the surface in pristine condition. They are also one of the prime sources of information about completely inaccessible rocks, such as those in the Earth&#x27;s lower mantle and in the mantles of the other terrestrial planets and the Moon. The work of experimental petrologists has laid a foundation on which modern understanding of igneous and metamorphic processes has been built.

<doc id="340987" wikidata="Q138966" url="?curid=340987" title="Fouquieria splendens">
<text>Fouquieria splendens (commonly known as ocotillo (), but also referred to as buggywhip, coachwhip, candlewood, slimwood, desert coral, Jacob&#x27;s staff, Jacob cactus, and vine cactus) is a plant indigenous to the Mojave Desert, Sonoran Desert, Chihuahuan Desert and Colorado Desert in the Southwestern United States (southern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas), and northern Mexico (as far south as Hidalgo and Guerrero).

While semi-succulent and a desert plant, Ocotillo is more closely related to the tea plant and blueberries than to cactuses. For much of the year, the plant appears to be an arrangement of large spiny dead sticks, although closer examination reveals that the stems are partly green. With rainfall, the plant quickly becomes lush with small (2–4 cm), ovate leaves, which may remain for weeks or even months.

Individual stems may reach a diameter of 5 cm at the base, and the plant may grow to a height of 10 m (33 ft). The plant branches very heavily at its base, but above that, the branches are pole-like and rarely divide further. Specimens in cultivation may not exhibit any secondary branches. The leaf stalks harden into blunt spines, and new leaves sprout from the base of the spine.

The bright crimson flowers appear especially after rainfall in spring, summer, and occasionally fall. Flowers are clustered indeterminately at the tips of each mature stem. Individual flowers are mildly zygomorphic and are pollinated by hummingbirds and native carpenter bees.

== Distribution ==

Ocotillo occurs in desert regions of southwestern United States through central Mexico. It grows in dry, generally rocky soils.

==Cultivation==
Ocotillo can be planted year-round with care. Ideal plants have been grown in pots from stem cuttings and from seed. Transplanting large bare-root plants has marginal success. They should be planted to the original growing depth and, as with cacti, in their original directional orientation: the original south side of the plant, which has become more heat- and sunlight-resistant, should again face the brighter, hotter southern direction. If their direction is not marked, success is again limited.

==Uses==
* Individual ocotillo stems are sometimes used as poles as a fencing material in their native region, and often take root to form a living fence.
* Due to their light weight and interesting pattern, ocotillo branches have been used for canes or walking sticks.
* Fresh flowers are sometimes used in salads and have a tangy flavor.
* Flowers are collected, dried, and used for tisanes.
* According to &quot;Medicinal Plants of the Desert and Canyon West&quot; (a book published in 1989 by Museum of New Mexico Press), a fresh bark tincture can be made by chopping or snipping freshly removed bark into 1/2-inch pieces. It is said to be useful for those symptoms that arise due to fluid congestion and to be absorbed from the intestines into the mesenteric lymph system by way of the lacteals of the small intestinal lining. This is believed to stimulate better visceral lymph drainage into the thoracic duct and improve dietary fat absorption into the lymph system.
* Bathing in water that contains crushed flowers or roots has been used to relieve fatigue.
* Native Americans place the flowers and roots of ocotillo over fresh wounds to slow bleeding. 
* Ocotillo is also used to alleviate coughing, achy limbs, varicose veins, urinary tract infections, cervical varicosities, and benign prostate growths.

==Subspecies==
The three subspecies are:
*&quot;F. s. splendens&quot; 
*&quot;F. s. breviflora&quot; 
*&quot;F. s. campanulata&quot;

<doc id="340989" wikidata="Q1327761" url="?curid=340989" title="Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand">
<text>The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand (), commonly known as Green or the Greens, is a green political party in New Zealand. Like many green parties around the world, it has four pillars (ecological wisdom, social justice, grassroots democracy, and nonviolence). The party&#x27;s ideology combines environmentalism with social democratic economic policies, including well-funded and locally controlled public services within the confines of a steady-state economy. Internationally, it is affiliated with the Global Greens.

The Green Party traces its origins to the Values Party, founded in 1972 as the world&#x27;s first national-level environmentalist party. The current Green Party was formed in 1990. From 1991 to 1997, the party participated in the Alliance, a grouping of five left-wing parties. It gained representation in Parliament at the 1996 election.

Historically, the Green Party had two co-leaders, one male and one female. In May 2022, Green Party members voted to change the co-leadership model, now requiring one female leader and one leader of any gender, and that one leader must be Māori. Marama Davidson has been the female co-leader since 2018. Chlöe Swarbrick became co-leader in March 2024, succeeding James Shaw, who had been elected as male co-leader in 2015.

It is the third largest party in the House of Representatives, with 15 MPs. In 2020, the party agreed to cooperate with the Sixth Labour Government and received two ministerial portfolios in return. The Green Party contests many local government elections throughout New Zealand. Green Party representative Celia Wade-Brown served as Mayor of Wellington from 2010 to 2016, and in 2019, Aaron Hawkins was elected as the Mayor of Dunedin. In Auckland, the Green Party campaigns with the Labour Party, under the City Vision political banner.

==Principles and policies==

The Green Party was founded to counter what it sees as threats to the natural environment. Environmental issues remain its main focus. In recent times, it has expressed concerns about mining of national parks, fresh water, peak oil and the release of genetically engineered organisms. The party strongly supports efforts to address climate change based on scientific evidence, by transitioning away from the burning of fossil fuels to renewable energy production, as well as making carbon pricing more transparent and bringing the agricultural sector into the Emissions Trading Scheme.

The Green Party has spoken out in support of human rights and against military operations conducted by the United States and other countries in Afghanistan and Iraq. The party has also expressed sympathy for the Palestinians and criticised the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories.

The party is also known for its advocacy on numerous social issues, such as the legalisation of marriage equality, the right to seek asylum and increasing the refugee quota, and gender equality.

The party accepts Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Māori language version of the treaty) as the founding document of New Zealand and recognises Māori as .

In its economic policies, the Green Party stresses factors such as sustainability, taxing the indirect costs of pollution, and fair trade. It also states that measuring economic success should concentrate on measuring well-being rather than analysing economic indicators. The party wants the eventual introduction of a universal basic income.

The party has previously campaigned on legalising cannabis and &quot;remov[ing] penalties for any person with a terminal illness, chronic or debilitating condition to cultivate, possess or use cannabis and/or cannabis products for therapeutic purposes, with the support of a registered medical practitioner&quot;. In the 2017–2020 term of the Sixth Labour Government, medicinal cannabis was legalised, but legalisation of recreational cannabis use was rejected in a 2020 referendum.

The Greens rely heavily on the well-educated, urban demographic for their voter base. Green voters have various priorities but are likely to have a high regard for the environment and environmental issues. However, research indicates very few people, who vote Green, do so purely for environmental concerns.

==History==
===Foundations===

The Green Party traces its origins to the Values Party, the world&#x27;s first national-level environmentalist party. The Values Party originated in 1972 at Victoria University of Wellington. While it gained a measure of public support in several elections, the then first-past-the-post electoral system meant that the party did not win any seats in the House of Representatives. Some of the founding members of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, notably Jeanette Fitzsimons, Rod Donald and Mike Ward, had been active members of the Values Party at the outset of the Green movement in the 1970s.

At the 1989 local-body elections, multiple candidates stood for local government positions under the &quot;Green&quot; label. It saw the election of New Zealand&#x27;s first Green city councillor, Stephen Rainbow, in Wellington. He was joined the next year by councillor Merrin Downing, who left the Citizens&#x27; Association to join the Greens.

In May 1990, remnants of the Values Party merged with a number of other environmentalist organisations to form the modern Green Party. This sparked a resurgence of support, with the new group winning 6.85% of the vote (but no seats) in the 1990 election.

===The Alliance years===
The following year, the Greens became co-founding members of the Alliance, a five-party grouping that also consisted of the Democrats, Liberals, Mana Motuhake and NewLabour Party. Immediately prior to this there had been limited co-operation between the parties running joint candidates in several local-body by-elections in Auckland. One candidate, Ruth Norman, was from the Greens and was elected to the Auckland Regional Council. At the Alliance&#x27;s inaugural party conference in November 1992 party members elected Jeanette Fitzsimons from the Greens as a co-deputy leader of the Alliance.

The Greens contested the 1993 and 1996 elections as part of the Alliance. Membership of the Alliance was a controversial decision with a sizeable minority in the party remaining opposed to it. Consequently the party was plagued in the following few years by persistent calls for departure from the Alliance. Over time the issue became a more divisive issue internally until eventually a splinter party (the Progressive Green Party) was set up by members who were unhappy at the direction of the Alliance, which they believed was too left-wing and too focused on social justice type issues, detracting focus from environmental issues.

Until the 1995 annual conference in Taupō, the Greens had no elected leaders. At that conference, Jeanette Fitzsimons was elected unopposed as female co-leader, and Rod Donald defeated Joel Cayford and Mike Smith in a three-way contest to become male co-leader.

After New Zealand adopted the mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system in 1996, the Alliance gained entry to Parliament, bringing three Green list MPs with them: Jeanette Fitzsimons, Rod Donald and Phillida Bunkle.

In 1997, feeling that membership of the Alliance had subsumed their identity, the Greens took the decision to stand candidates independently of the Alliance at the next election. While most of the Green party members left the Alliance, some decided, instead, to leave the Green Party and stay in the Alliance (including Bunkle, who would later be appointed Minister of Customs in the Labour-Alliance coalition government). Conversely, some of the Alliance party members, who joined the Alliance via other parties, decided to leave the Alliance and join the Green Party, notably Sue Bradford and Keith Locke, who both joined the Alliance via NewLabour.

===Green Party in Parliament===
====1999 election====
In the 1999 election, the Greens gained 5.16% of the party vote and seven seats in Parliament. Fitzsimons also won the electorate seat of Coromandel; it is believed that this is the first time a Green candidate won a first-past-the-post parliamentary election. During the ten days it took to count special votes and confirm Fitzsimons&#x27; election, Labour concluded a coalition agreement with the Alliance which excluded the Greens. However, the party supported the government on confidence and supply in return for some input into the budget and legislation. This led to the Greens gaining a $15 million energy efficiency and environmental package in the new government&#x27;s first budget. Over the term, the Greens developed a good working relationship with the government and also had some input into policy, notably Sue Bradford&#x27;s amendments to the Employment Relations Act 2000.

====2002 election====
In the 2002 election, the Greens polled 7.00%, increasing their strength in Parliament to nine seats, although they lost the Coromandel electorate. The electoral campaign featured strong tensions between the Greens and Labour. The Greens sharply criticised Labour for its plans to allow a moratorium on genetic engineering to expire, and believing that Labour would require their support to form a government, intended to make the extension of this moratorium a non-negotiable part of any deal. After the election, however, Labour and their coalition partner, the Jim Anderton-led Progressive Coalition, instead opted to rely on support from United Future, at that time a party with conservative Christian overtones.

Although the Greens no longer had any input into the budget, they maintained a close working relationship with the government, and the Greens remained involved in the legislation process. Often the government needed to rely on Green votes in the House to pass progressive legislation not approved by United Future. The government won praise from political commentators for juggling the two diametrically-opposed parties.

While the moratorium on genetic modification has now expired, the Greens remain heavily involved in attempts to prevent any GM releases under the new regulatory framework, and genetic engineering remains a major topic for the party.

====2005 election====
In the 2005 election, the Greens won 5.30%, returning six of their MPs to Parliament. Despite expressing clear support for a Labour-led government during the campaign, they were excluded from the resulting coalition, due to a refusal by United Future and NZ First to work with the Greens in cabinet. They were, however, able to negotiate a cooperation agreement which saw limited input into the budget and broad consultation on policy. Both co-leaders were appointed as government spokespeople outside cabinet, with Fitzsimons responsible for Energy Efficiency, and Donald responsible for the Buy Kiwi Made campaign. However, Rod Donald died the day before Parliament was due to sit and the position of government spokesperson on Buy Kiwi Made was filled by Sue Bradford. Nándor Tánczos took up the vacant list position and the co-leader position remained vacant until a new co-leader, Russel Norman was elected at their 2006 annual general meeting. The other contenders for the position were Nándor Tánczos, David Clendon and former MP Mike Ward.
Bradford also introduced, in 2005, the members&#x27; bill that would become the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The bill sought to outlaw the legal defence of &quot;reasonable force&quot; for parents prosecuted for assault against children. It led to widespread debate and accusations that MPs supporting the bill were fostering a &#x27;nanny state&#x27; approach. Despite this, the Bill became law after it passed its third reading on 16 May 2007 with an overwhelming majority of 113 votes for and 7 votes against.

====2008 election====
In the 2008 election, the Greens increased their share of the vote to 6.72%, enough for 9 MPs, even though there was a swing throughout the country to the National Party. This initially gave the Greens two extra MPs, but counting the special votes brought in a third. They became the third largest parliamentary party in New Zealand, and signed a memorandum of understanding with the governing National Party.

Metiria Turei was elected at the 2009 annual general meeting after former female co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons stood down as an MP in February 2009.

====2011 election====
In the 2011 election, the Green Party received nearly a quarter of a million party votes (247,372), equating to 11.06% of the total valid party votes nationwide, earning them 14 seats in the 50th Parliament. Preliminary results on election night showed them with 10.6% of the vote, equivalent to 13 seats, but special votes increased their support enough to gain an extra seat. They remained the third largest parliamentary party in New Zealand.

====2014 election====
In the 2014 general election, the Green Party&#x27;s share of the party vote fell slightly to 10.70%. Despite this, they retained all of their 14 seats and remained the third largest party in Parliament.

James Shaw was elected at the party&#x27;s 2015 annual general meeting over fellow MPs Gareth Hughes and Kevin Hague, and party member Vernon Tava. He succeeded Russel Norman, who resigned in November 2015 to work as Executive Director of Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand.

====2017 election====
In their 2017 election campaign launch on 9 July 2017, the Green Party proposed charging bottling companies a 10% tax for exporting water, with the revenue being split between local councils and Māori tribes or iwi. They also announced that they would ban new resource consents for bottling companies until the establishment of a new comprehensive commercial water pricing scheme.

In July 2017, co-leader Metiria Turei criticised the populist New Zealand First party and its leader Winston Peters for alleged racism, particularly towards immigration. List MP Barry Coates penned an article in the left-wing &quot;The Daily Blog&quot; claiming that the Greens would call a snap election rather than be excluded from a prospective Labour and New Zealand First coalition government. Turei and Coates&#x27; comments were fiercely criticised by both Peters and New Zealand First MP Tracey Martin, who warned that this would affect post-election negotiations between the two parties. Fellow co-leader Shaw later clarified that Coates&#x27; remarks did not represent Green Party policy.

On 16 July, in order to raise awareness of the inadequacies of the welfare system, Turei disclosed that she had committed benefit fraud in the past. Turei also advocated for raising the domestic purposes benefit for families during the Green Party&#x27;s electoral campaign. Her disclosure generated considerable interest from the media, politicians, and the New Zealand blogosphere. On 7 August, Green MPs Kennedy Graham and party whip David Clendon resigned as Green Party candidates due to their disagreement with Turei&#x27;s actions and handling of the situation. They formally resigned from the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary caucus the following day after the party made moves to remove them &quot;involuntarily.&quot;
On 9 August, Turei resigned as co-leader and as a list candidate, stating that the media scrutiny on her family had become unbearable. James Shaw remained the Green Party&#x27;s sole leader for the 2017 election. Clendon stated that he would not be returning to the Green Party list despite Turei&#x27;s resignation. Graham sought to return to the party list, but this was declined on 12 August by the Green Party Executive. Leader James Shaw indicated that there was considerable animosity within the party towards Clendon and Graham for their actions.

On 17 August, it was reported that the Green Party had fallen by 11 points to 4% in the &quot;1News&quot;–Colmar Brunton Poll, below the 5% threshold needed to enter Parliament under New Zealand&#x27;s mixed-member proportional system. The party&#x27;s sharp drop in the opinion poll was attributed to negative publicity around the Green Party&#x27;s infighting and the ascension of Jacinda Ardern as leader of the centre-left Labour Party, the Greens&#x27; nominal ally. By contrast, the Roy Morgan opinion poll placed public support for the Green Party at 9%.

The 2017 general election returned eight list MPs, with 6.3% of the party vote. The Green parliamentary caucus&#x27; newest members were Chlöe Swarbrick, who became the youngest member of the House, and Golriz Ghahraman, the first refugee member of the House.

Following the election results, Party Leader Shaw stated that the Greens would not be seeking a coalition with the National Party. He added that the party was pursuing a coalition rather than a support agreement with the Labour and socially-conservative New Zealand First parties. On 9 October, the Greens leader Shaw took part in negotiations with the Labour Party.
During the coalition-forming negotiations, NZ First leader Peters turned down Shaw&#x27;s invitation for the two parties to negotiate directly on the grounds that the Greens and Labour had campaigned together under a memorandum of understanding during the 2017 election.

====First term in Government, 2017–2020 ====

In October 2017, the Greens entered a confidence and supply arrangement with the Labour Party which gave them three ministers outside cabinet and one under-secretary role. This marked the first time the Greens had been in government. Party leader James Shaw was appointed Minister for Climate Change and Statistics and Associate Minister of Finance. Julie Anne Genter was made Minister for Women and Associate Minister of Health and Transport. Eugenie Sage was made Minister of Conservation and Land Information and Associate Minister for the Environment. Jan Logie was appointed Parliamentary Undersecretary to the Minister of Justice with a focus on domestic and sexual violence issues.

As a support partner of the Labour-New Zealand First coalition government, the Greens secured several policies and concessions including a proposed Zero Carbon Act, a referendum on legalising personal cannabis use by 2020, establishing a proposed Climate Commission, a proposed Green Transport Card to reduce public transportation costs, investing in rail and cycle infrastructure, light rail construction to Auckland Airport, increasing the Department of Conservation&#x27;s funding, eliminating &quot;excessive&quot; benefit sanctions and the gender pay gap, a rent-to-own-scheme as part of KiwiBuild, and re-establishing the Mental Health Commission.

In 2019, a number of Trans members resigned after a Green Party magazine published an article from a member concerned about the growing divide between women in the party and LGBTQIA+ members.

In late August 2020, Shaw was criticised by members of the Green Party, the opposition National Party, school principals and teachers unions for allocating, in his role as Associate Minister of Finance, NZ$11.7 million from the Government&#x27;s $3 billion COVID-19 &quot;shovel-ready&quot; recovery fund to the private &quot;Green School New Zealand&quot; in Taranaki. This funding boost contradicted the party&#x27;s own policy of opposing giving government funds to private schools. Shaw had lobbied for the inclusion of the school in the &quot;shovel-ready&quot; fund, claiming that it would have boosted the local economy and created jobs. 
Former Green MPs Catherine Delahunty, Mojo Mathers and Sue Bradford denounced Shaw&#x27;s decision as a betrayal of the Green Party&#x27;s policies and principles. Shaw subsequently apologised to Green MPs during a Zoom call, describing his action as an &quot;error of judgment.&quot; On 2 November, it was reported that the Government had reached an agreement with the school&#x27;s owners, Michael and Rachel Perrett, for the NZ$11.7 million grant to be converted into a loan; a development that was welcomed by local principals.

====2020 election====

During the 2020 New Zealand general election held on 17 October, the Greens returned to Parliament with 7.9% of the popular vote, giving them ten seats. In addition, Green MP Chlöe Swarbrick won the Auckland Central electorate seat by 1,068 votes.

Despite the Labour Party winning a parliamentary majority and not needing to form a coalition agreement with other parties, Labour and the Green parties undertook a series of discussions about areas of cooperation. Green co-leader James Shaw had indicated that the Greens would be open to negotiating with Labour about its wealth tax policy as part of coalition negotiations. Earlier, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had ruled out supporting the Green&#x27;s wealth tax policy during campaigning. On 20 October, &quot;Newshub&quot; reported that Ardern was not seeking a formal coalition between Labour and the Green Party but was exploring a lower-level support arrangement.

====Second term in Government, 2020–2023====
Following prolonged negotiations between the Green and Labour parties&#x27; leaderships, the Green Party accepted a deal on 31 October under which their co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson would become ministers outside the Cabinet. Under this cooperation agreement, Shaw would remain Minister for Climate Change and become an associate minister for the environment (with responsibility for biodiversity) while Davidson would take the new role of Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence and become an associate minister of housing (with responsibility for homelessness). In addition, Green MPs would fill one chair and one deputy chair role on two select committees. &quot;Stuff&quot; reported that these would likely be held by former ministers Eugenie Sage and Julie Anne Genter on the Environment Committee and Transport Committee, respectively. During a Zoom call, 85% of the 150 Green Party delegates voted to accept this cooperation agreement with Labour.

The agreement was described by Ardern as &quot;honouring the mandate provided to Labour to form a majority Government in our own right&quot; while ensuring the Government &quot;govern[s] for all New Zealanders and to reach as wide a consensus on key issues as possible.&quot; Several former Green MPs, including former co-leader Russel Norman, Sue Bradford, and Catherine Delahunty, criticised the cooperation agreement for giving the Greens a weak position to influence the policy process within the newly formed Labour Government.

On 19 May, Ghahraman sponsored a motion on behalf of the Green Party calling for Members of Parliament to recognise the right of Palestinians to self-determination and statehood. The motion was supported by the Greens and the Māori Party but was opposed by the centre-right National and ACT parties. The governing Labour Party also declined to support the Greens&#x27; motion, with the Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard criticising Ghahraman for sponsoring the motion despite knowing that it was going to be voted down.

In June 2021, it was revealed the Green Party had received $54,000 in donations from Lindsay Fraser, whom the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RNZSPCA) has called the worst animal abuser in New Zealand history.

In July 2021, Shaw&#x27;s co-leadership of the Greens was challenged by Dunedin climate activist and software developer James Cockle, who expressed dissatisfaction that the Greens were being seen as &quot;Labour&#x27;s little helper.&quot; During a vote at the party&#x27;s annual general meeting in August 2021, Shaw was overwhelmingly re-elected, winning 116 delegate votes with just four to Cockle.

In January 2022, Radio New Zealand reported that several Green Party executive and policy branch members had resigned from the Party citing disagreement with the Green Party leadership&#x27;s cooperation agreement with the governing Labour Party, taking issue with what they regarded as the Greens&#x27; perceived limited ability to hold the Government to account on policy differences. These former members also alleged Shaw was practising an autocratic leadership style and that the party executive was not holding the parliamentary caucus and leadership to account over policy decisions in government. In addition, several former Green leaders and MPs, including Bradford, Delahunty, and Norman, criticised the party&#x27;s limited position within the Labour Government, the Government&#x27;s alleged pro-business policies, and climate change position. In response to criticism, co-leaders Shaw and Davidson claimed that the party was democratic and making &quot;progressive changes&quot; in government.

In early May 2022, the Green Party scrapped its male co-leadership requirement during a weekend special meeting to amend its constitution. Under these changes, the two new co-leaders now need to consist of one woman and one person of any gender (with leadership pathways for non-binary and intersex individuals). In addition, at least one of the future co-leaders is required to be of Māori descent.

On 23 July, an annual general meeting was held online to decide on the party&#x27;s leadership. While Davidson was re-elected unopposed, 32 of the 107 delegates voted to reopen nominations for Shaw&#x27;s position, meeting the 25% threshold needed to remove him as co-leader and trigger a leadership election under the party&#x27;s rules. Shaw was criticised by elements within the party including party member Travis Mischewski and former Green MP Delahunty for his perceived &quot;moderate leadership&quot; and inability to effect change within the Labour Government and tackle climate change. On 25 July, Shaw confirmed that he would contest the co-leadership election. That same day, fellow MPs Chlöe Swarbrick and Elizabeth Kerekere confirmed that they would not be contesting the co-leadership position.

On 10 September, Shaw was re-elected as Green Party co-leader by 142 (97%) of the 145 eligible delegates in the party&#x27;s special election. Shaw was the only candidate to contest the 2022 co-leadership election.

====2023 election====
As part of the party&#x27;s policy plan for the 2023 general election it put forward the policy of a guaranteed minimum income for those out of work and those studying of $385 a week for individuals, $770 a week for couples, and $735 for single parents, all after tax. This would be phased in over 2 years and paid for via a wealth tax of 2.5% (two point five percent) on assets worth more than four million New Zealand dollars for couples and two million for singles, as well as a top rate of tax of 45% on incomes over $180,000 and a 33% corporate tax rate. Those with a salary under $125,000 would be granted a tax free threshold of $10,000. The party stated this would result in &quot;tax cuts of between $16 and $26 a week for 3.7 million New Zealanders&quot; and anyone earning under $125,000 would pay less tax as part of its plan.

In the 2023 general election, the Green Party&#x27;s share of the party vote rose to 11.6% and it increased its number of seats by six to 15: three electorates and 12 list MPs. This is the highest number of Green MPs to ever be elected into Parliament thus far. The party returned to opposition, as support partner Labour came second to National.

====In opposition, 2023–present====
In January 2024 Shaw announced that he would be resigning as co-leader of the Green Party and retiring from politics. Amid shoplifting allegations, Golriz Ghahraman resigned in January 2024. She was replaced by Celia Wade-Brown. On 21 February 2024, Fa&#x27;anānā Efeso Collins died during a charity run in Auckland. He was replaced by Lawrence Xu-Nan. On 15 March 2024, Darleen Tana was stood down after allegations of migrant exploitation. On 6 May 2024, James Shaw resigned from parliament and was replaced by Francisco Hernandez.

In November 2024, the Greens&#x27; Copyright (Parody and Satire) Amendment Bill, which proposed allowing copyrighted works to be used for parody, satire and memes, was pulled from Parliament&#x27;s ballot.

===Local body elections===
====2013 local elections====
In the 2013 local elections, the Greens won three city council and two regional council seats in Wellington, a council seat in Dunedin, and also enjoyed success in Christchurch and Gisborne.

====2016 local elections====
During the 2016 local elections, Green Dunedin candidate Aaron Hawkins was re-elected to the Dunedin City Council and was joined by the Green Party&#x27;s first elected Pasifika representative, Councillor Marie Laufiso. During the 2016 Wellington local election, four Green candidates Sue Kedgley, Iona Pannett, Sarah Free, and David Lee were elected onto the Greater Wellington Regional Council and the Lambton, Eastern, and Southern Wards of the Wellington City Council. Several Green candidates also contested seats on the Auckland Council, local boards, and licensing trusts during the 2016 Auckland local body elections.

In addition, Brent Barrett was elected to Palmerston North City Council.

====2019 local elections====
The 2019 New Zealand local elections were the most successful local body elections ever for the party, culminating in 42 successful candidates. Notably, Aaron Hawkins was elected Mayor of Dunedin, becoming the first Green Party candidate to ever win a mayoralty in New Zealand.

In addition, Brent Barrett was re-elected to the Palmerston North City Council and was joined by a second Green candidate Renee Dingwall. Future Green MP Teanau Tuiono also ran for the position of Mayor of Palmerston North but was defeated by the incumbent Grant Smith.

====2022 local elections====
During the 2022 New Zealand local elections, ten Green branded candidates were elected to local government positions. Though Aaron Hawkins was defeated in his bid to be re-elected as Mayor of Dunedin, the Green-endorsed Tory Whanau was elected as Mayor of Wellington.

Green councillor Tamatha Paul was elected to the Wellington City Council (WCC) and became the chair of its new environment and infrastructure committee. In addition, Laurie Foon and Nīkau Wi Neera were elected to the WCC&#x27;s Southern General Ward and Te Whanganui-a-Tara Māori ward.

In addition, Yadana Saw, Thomas Nash, and Quentin Duthie were elected on the Green Party ticket to the Greater Wellington Regional Council.

Green councillor Brent Barrett was re-elected for a third term on the Palmerston North City Council (PNCC). In addition, Kaydee Zabelin was elected to the PNCC on the Green ticket.

In Otago, Marie Laufiso was elected to the Dunedin City Council as a councillor. In addition, Alan Somerville was elected to the Dunedin Regional Constituency of the Otago Regional Council.

===2024 Wellington by-election===
In February 2024, Green Party candidate Georgie Rogers was elected to the Pukehīnau/Lambton General Ward in the Wellington City Council. The ward had been vacated by Tamatha Paul, who had been elected to Parliament as a Green MP during the 2023 New Zealand general election.

== Structure ==
The party adopted a new constitution in 2022, named Te Waka Framework. This is a te tiriti-based structure that is derived from the party&#x27;s charter and commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The framework contains four sections: Te Waka, Ngā Haumi, Te Hāpai, and Ngā Tumu, and is based on the journey of a waka.

=== Provinces and branches ===
A province is a collection of branches which has sufficient sense of common identity defined by natural geographical boundaries. Branches are a collection of members with an electorate-based geographical area of responsibility.

=== Networks ===
There are a number of identity or interest-based networks across the party. These include:
*Degrowth Greens
*Green Women (a network for women members)
*Inclusive Greens (a network for members living with a disability)
*Pasifika Greens (a network for members with Pasifika ancestry)
*Rainbow Greens (a network for LGBTQIA+ members)
*Rural Greens (a network for members with interests in rural and agricultural issues)
*GreenLeft (a network for left-wing, anti-capitalist members)
*Te Roopu Pounamu (a Māori network)
*Union Greens (representing trade unions)
*Young Greens

==Electoral performance==
===House of Representatives===
* As part of the Alliance political party group.
==Office holders==
The party has six equal status office holders that form their leadership group:

* two co-leaders (one female and one of any gender, one of whom must be Māori)
* two party co-convenors (one female and one of any gender)
* two policy co-convenors (one female and one of any gender)

The co-leaders lead the caucus, the party co-convenors lead the party executive, and the policy co-convenors lead the policy committee. The leadership group facilitates high level discussion and co-ordination between the three committees.

===Co-leaders===


===Co-convenors===
Equivalent to the organisational president of other parties. Historically, there was always one male co-convenor and one female co-convenor. As of May 2022, the party&#x27;s new constitution requires one female co-convenor and one co-convenor of any gender.

===Policy co-convenors===
Policy co-convenors are the leaders of the policy committee, which is autonomous from both the caucus and the party executive. While lower in public profile than the party co-convenors, the policy co-convenors are considered to have the same status as the party co-convenors, and are elected in the same way. As of May 2022, the party&#x27;s new constitution requires one female policy co-convenor and one policy co-convenor of any gender.

===Current members of parliament===
The Green Party has 15 seats in parliament due its share of the party vote won in the 2023 general election.

Golriz Ghahraman resigned in January 2024 and was replaced by Celia Wade-Brown. Efeso Collins died on 21 February 2024 and was replaced by Lawrence Xu-Nan. the MPs are, in order of their 2023 election list ranking:

<doc id="340996" wikidata="Q2536699" url="?curid=340996" title="The Kliq">
<text>The Kliq was a backstage group in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) during the mid-1990s, composed of Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Sean Waltman, Shawn Michaels, and Triple H. Michaels, Nash, and Hall wielded a considerable amount of power within the company at the time, which they reportedly used to positively influence one another&#x27;s careers and occasionally negatively influence the careers of others.

In May 1996, The Kliq broke character at a live event at Madison Square Garden in an unscripted incident referred to as the &quot;Curtain Call&quot;, which had far-reaching ramifications for the WWF specifically and the wrestling world as a whole. At a time when professional wrestling organizations worked to maintain the illusion of storylines and characters, the Curtain Call marked the first time that such high-profile performers had so publicly broken character, forcing the WWF and other wrestling organizations to begin acknowledging the scripted elements of their programming.

The Kliq was also the primary catalyst for two of the most well-known stables in wrestling history: the New World Order (nWo) in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and later the WWF/E, and D-Generation X (DX) in the WWF/E. Michaels and Waltman would serve in both groups; Triple H was a member of DX, while Nash and Hall performed with the nWo. Waltman, who wrestled for both WCW and the WWF during the mid-to-late 1990s, is recognized by WWE as the only wrestler to have been &quot;an active member of both the nWo and DX during their heydays&quot;, as Michaels only joined the nWo during their WWF/E reunion in June 2002, becoming the leader before the group disbanded in July.

== History ==
=== Formation and early history ===
The Kliq was formed in 1994 by real-life friends Scott Hall (then known as Razor Ramon), Kevin Nash (Diesel), Shawn Michaels, and Sean Waltman (1-2-3 Kid). In January 1995, Paul Levesque left WCW and arrived in the WWF as Hunter Hearst Helmsley (Triple H) and became the next member of The Kliq. Each man enjoyed a tremendous amount of popularity with fans, which allotted them a particular degree of control over their own careers. Nash, Hall, and Michaels, then among the company&#x27;s most popular performers, came up with the idea of forming a backstage alliance, which would potentially allow them to consolidate even more power within the company. Bret Hart, another of the company&#x27;s top performers at the time, claims in his autobiography &quot;Hitman&quot; that he was also asked if he wanted to be part of The Kliq, but declined the offer: &quot;The thing I remember most about that tour was Shawn, Razor, and Nash talking to me in Hamburg about the idea of forming a clique of top guys who strictly took care of their own&quot;. Levesque mentioned on the 2013 &quot;Triple H – Thy Kingdom Come&quot; DVD that he was recruited to the Kliq by Kevin Nash because he didn&#x27;t do drugs or alcohol, and thus could serve as the group&#x27;s designated driver after events.

Michaels claims that the name &quot;The Kliq&quot; was originally coined by Lex Luger, due to the closeness of the five friends backstage, while Lex Luger had suggested that Davey Boy Smith created the name, because the five kept &quot;clicking&quot;, referring to how often they talked. At the suggestion of Vince Russo, Michaels began referring to his fans as his &quot;Kliq&quot;. Michaels wrote in his 2006 autobiography that he disliked the idea, and that it &quot;was not a huge hit&quot; with the fans.

In 1995, the men&#x27;s growing popularity as performers led to the group developing a heavy influence on the power to schedule matches and decide match outcomes, write storylines, and largely determine the trajectory of other performers&#x27; careers. The group used this power to give one another preferential treatment, usually scheduling each other in heavily promoted, high-profile matches, often against one another: during the period of 1994 through 1996 particularly, Ramon had high-profile feuds with 1-2-3 Kid, Diesel, and Michaels, while Diesel and Michaels formed a championship-winning tag-team called Two Dudes with Attitudes.

The group&#x27;s perceived abuse of power led to animosity amongst other wrestlers, particularly lower-ranking members of the company. In one instance, performer Carl Ouellet, then performing as Jean-Pierre Lafitte, claimed that his scheduled defeat of Diesel was vetoed by Michaels, leading to a backstage confrontation between Ouellet and Michaels. The match between the two ended in a double-countout because Lafitte refused to be pinned by Nash. In retaliation, the group effectively ended Ouellet&#x27;s career with the company by scheduling him to repeatedly lose low-profile matches. In his autobiography, Michaels admitted that &quot;we buried him.&quot; Lafitte left the company soon after the incident; contrary to rumors, Michaels says that WWF Chairman Vince McMahon did not fire Lafitte.

=== The MSG &quot;Curtain Call&quot; ===
In April 1996, Nash and Hall signed contracts with WCW, the WWF&#x27;s top competitor, with whom the company was embroiled in a bitter rivalry. Accounts have differed as to what led to the men&#x27;s departure. Wrestling commentators have speculated that their contracts were allowed to expire in order to cripple The Kliq&#x27;s influence in the company, while official WWE media asserts that Nash and Hall were simply offered more money by WCW than the WWF was able to promise them at the time. Hall himself claimed he left because he felt his pay in the WWF had plateaued, while Nash has stated he left because WCW offered a guaranteed contract, something the WWF had been unwilling to do for any wrestler at that point.

Nash and Hall&#x27;s last contracted match for the WWF took place on May 19, 1996, at Madison Square Garden. At the time, Levesque and Nash were wrestling as villains, while Michaels and Hall were fan favorites. At the end of the night, Michaels wrestled Nash in a steel cage match. Immediately after the match, Hall entered the ring and hugged Michaels; this was not seen as unusual in-story, as both wrestlers were babyfaces. However, Levesque then entered the ring and hugged Hall, followed by Nash. The four wrestlers then group hugged for several seconds before they turned to face the crowd with their arms raised together. Waltman, who himself would leave for WCW shortly after the incident, was in drug rehab at the time and thus didn&#x27;t participate.
Their actions – dubbed the &quot;Curtain Call&quot; – scandalized WWF management. At the time, most major wrestling promotions, the WWF included, prided themselves on maintaining kayfabe – the illusion that all of the events which transpired in-ring were real and unscripted, and that wrestlers&#x27; on-screen rivalries extended outside of the ring. The company had a strict policy of onscreen rivals not breaking character by associating with one another on WWF programming, as a means of maintaining storylines and feuds between wrestlers, which sometimes lasted for years and could unravel in seconds if the two feuding wrestlers were seen associating as friends in public. WWF Chairman Vince McMahon was reported to have initially given his tacit approval for a &quot;farewell&quot; ceremony, but did not realize that it would become so elaborate. The severity of the incident was further compounded by the revelation that the event—which was not broadcast on television—had been filmed by two fans, Mani Mohtadi and Jason Cosmides, who had smuggled a camcorder past security. Stills from the footage were widely disseminated online and in wrestling magazines at the time, bringing the Curtain Call to a wider audience than if it had not been recorded.

Because Hall and Nash had already confirmed their departure for WCW, and because Waltman was absent during the incident, the three wrestlers escaped punishment. Michaels, who was the WWF Champion at the time and one of the promotion&#x27;s biggest drawing performers, could not be punished. The punishment fell solely on Levesque, who was demoted from being a championship contender to wrestling inexperienced or lesser experienced wrestlers for the next several months. He did, however, win the WWF Intercontinental Championship five months later. Levesque&#x27;s unquestioning acceptance of his punishment had the unintended side effect of rehabilitating his image in the eyes of other performers who held a grudge against him for his time with the Kliq: according to The Undertaker in the &quot;HHH: The Game&quot; DVD, when Levesque first arrived in the WWF he was perceived as being arrogant and self-centered, but by accepting his punishment he earned legitimate respect.

The incident turned out to have a major impact on the WWF&#x27;s future. For the first time in modern pro-wrestling history, a major company was forced to acknowledge that its events were scripted; McMahon would later use this to his advantage in the development of several meta-storylines, including a skit on the October 6, 1997, episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; in which Michaels and Levesque, both in character, played footage of the Curtain Call incident. Before the Curtain Call, Levesque had been booked into the finals of the 1996 King of the Ring tournament during the following summer, but his place – and the push that usually went with it – would instead go to Stone Cold Steve Austin, igniting his rise toward superstardom, an event which ultimately helped the WWF defeat WCW in the Monday Night War. Levesque&#x27;s acceptance of his punishment and the respect it earned him resulted in him only suffering short-term repercussions. He would go on to win the following year&#x27;s King of the Ring tournament and later went on to become a 14-time world champion, beginning with his WWF Championship victory over Mankind the night after SummerSlam in 1999.

=== The nWo and D-Generation X ===

When Hall and Nash went to WCW, they formed the tag team The Outsiders, as well as the New World Order (nWo) stable alongside Hulk Hogan. Rather than see the breaking of kayfabe as a crisis moment for professional wrestling, WCW decided to exploit it by introducing their own meta-storyline that incorporated fans&#x27; growing awareness of the backstage politics of pro-wrestling: Upon Nash and Hall&#x27;s arrival, they were implied to still be working for the WWF, staging an &quot;invasion&quot; of WCW.

When Waltman later jumped to WCW, he also joined the nWo as Syxx, often working closely with the Outsiders and forming the trio known as the Wolfpac. Many fans criticized Kevin Nash for his booking tenure in WCW since it displayed the same self-promoting behavior associated with The Kliq on an even larger scale. Fans often pointed to Nash booking himself to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from the then-undefeated Goldberg and the subsequent match with Hogan as the most grievous of his &quot;offenses&quot;. Nash, however, claims that he did not have booking power at the time of the incident. Nash&#x27;s innocence claim is disputed in several shoot interviews by various WCW wrestlers from the time who claimed that he, Hogan and several others often refused to put other wrestlers over in order to keep themselves as the main stars.
Meanwhile, Michaels and Levesque began to persuade WWF management to let them pair up on screen, but management was hesitant and wanted to keep them separated on-screen. They eventually aligned together in the faction D-Generation X (DX), with Levesque&#x27;s &quot;Hunter Hearst Helmsley&quot; fictional persona gradually transformed and re-dubbed Triple H or HHH, and alongside Levesque&#x27;s then-girlfriend and on-screen female &quot;bodyguard&quot; Chyna. Rick Rude also temporarily joined the group (as a sort of on-screen bodyguard for Michaels), though his membership ended when he signed with WCW after his WWF contract expired in early November 1997.

DX eventually became as influential to the Monday Night War as the nWo. DX&#x27;s antics also went on to help spark The Attitude Era in the WWF. After Sean Waltman was fired from WCW, he was hired by WWF and joined DX, replacing the injured Michaels. The nWo&#x27;s hand sign, often referred to as the &quot;Wolf Head&quot;, was originally used by the Kliq members in the WWF. Hall and Nash brought the hand sign with them and it became widely used by the nWo members and fans worldwide.

On the October 6, 1997 &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Shawn Michaels alluded to this off-screen connection. After Bret Hart claimed to have destroyed the Kliq and to have &quot;run [Scott Hall and Kevin Nash] outta town&quot;, Michaels declared, &quot;The Kliq owns this [professional wrestling] business&quot;, and said that it had really undergone &quot;expansion&quot; rather than &quot;destruction&quot;. During a brief period in 1998, after Waltman&#x27;s return to the WWF as X-Pac, in promos the members of DX made numerous references to their &quot;friends&quot; in WCW. On the April 27, 1998 &quot;Raw&quot; (recorded live in Hampton, Virginia), DX (by now composed of Triple H, Waltman, Billy Gunn, Road Dogg and Chyna) staged a mock &quot;invasion&quot; protest/paramilitary take-over of the nearby Norfolk Scope, where &quot;Nitro&quot; was being held. Triple H, riding in an M38, chanted &quot;Let our people go!&quot; through a megaphone during the incident. Waltman called out, &quot;We just wanted to say &#x27;what&#x27;s up&#x27; to our boys Kevin Nash and Scott Hall&quot;. DX also led a chant of &quot;WCW sucks&quot; by fans outside the arena who had tickets to the show (some of whom, Triple H alleged, had been given free tickets to &quot;Nitro&quot; by WCW in order to boost crowd numbers, a common trick promoters have done to fill arenas and increase concession and merchandise sales).

In 2002, after WCW had gone out of business, The nWo was reformed in the WWF with Hall, Nash and Hogan, the group&#x27;s initial members. Hogan soon left the group after being attacked by Nash and Hall as a result of his turning into a fan favorite at WrestleMania X8. Other former members, including Big Show and Waltman, joined the group. Later, Shawn Michaels – after years away from the ring –was introduced by Kevin Nash as the newest member of the nWo, and Michaels promised the rest of the group that he would soon deliver Triple H. After weeks of lobbying for Triple H&#x27;s services, a backstage promo of The nWo wishing Triple H luck before the match aired. This included 4 members of The Kliq (Michaels, Nash, Waltman and Triple H), as Big Show appeared wishing Triple H good luck as well. The nWo told Triple H to &quot;throw up the hand signal&quot; if he needed any help out there. Shortly thereafter, Nash suffered a torn quadriceps (after returning the same night after time off due to a biceps injury) during a ten-man tag-team match, and the following week Vince McMahon disbanded The nWo. Eric Bischoff (acting as the Raw brand General Manager) later tried to make Michaels Triple H&#x27;s manager. This led to a short-lived reformation of DX, as Triple H turned on him the same night, setting off a long and heated feud that took approximately two years to resolve. The year after, Nash returned from injury as a fan favorite and sided with Michaels against Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair, Batista and Randy Orton).

=== Later formations ===
Michaels and Triple H have reformed D-Generation X multiple times, first reuniting for a six-month stint on the June 12, 2006, edition of Monday Night Raw. They would feud against the Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey), Big Show and Vince McMahon, and later the team of Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), until Triple H&#x27;s legitimate knee injury in the beginning of 2007. They would reform again in August 2009 during Shawn Michaels&#x27; last year in the WWE. During this year, D-Generation X would capture the Unified WWE Tag Team Championships at against Jericho and Big Show, which would become the start of the first and only title reign for Triple H and Shawn Michaels as a tag team. D-Generation X would later go on to disband in March 2010 (after losing the tag Team titles to Big Show and The Miz). Michaels would then focus heavily on ending the winning streak of The Undertaker at WrestleMania, having failed to do so at WrestleMania XXV, and he would put his career on the line for their second WrestleMania encounter at WrestleMania XXVI which he would go on to lose and therefore end his career.

Hall, Nash and Waltman (then working for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) would reunite in a stable called The Band, where Hall and Nash won the TNA World Tag Team Championship, but Hall and Waltman were released shortly after (and Nash&#x27;s contract would expire later on in the year).

On April 2, 2011, The Kliq, consisting of Nash, Waltman, Triple H and Shawn Michaels, made a special appearance as Shawn Michaels was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011. Scott Hall decided not to attend the Hall of Fame ceremony or other WrestleMania XXVII festivities due to concerns of remaining sober. In 2014, at the conclusion of Scott Hall&#x27;s Hall of Fame induction, the members of The Kliq joined him onstage and reunited for the first time since the curtain call incident. They reunited again in 2015 on an episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, and then again at Nash&#x27;s Hall of Fame induction.

A December 2014 episode of WWE Network show &quot;The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW&quot; focused on The Kliq.

On March 14, 2022, Hall died at the age of 63.

<doc id="340998" wikidata="Q6507679" url="?curid=340998" title="Le Show">
<text>Le Show is a weekly syndicated public radio show hosted by satirist Harry Shearer.
The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy. Shearer, an impressionist known for his voice work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, writes the sketches and usually performs all the voices.
== History ==
The show first aired on December 3, 1983, and ran under various titles for several months before &quot;Le Show&quot; at the suggestion of a long-time friend of the host. A satire of a popular marketing trend at the time to add &quot;Le&quot; to product names such as the Renault 5 which was heavily promoted in the US as Le Car.

Until April 14, 2013, for almost 30 years, &quot;Le Show&quot; usually originated live on Sunday mornings from &quot;The Le Show Dome&quot; (its reference for the studios) at KCRW in Santa Monica (&quot;The city known around the world&quot;, Shearer says in his sign off, &quot;as the home… of the homeless&quot;). It is also frequently recorded at or broadcast from other NPR and public stations when Shearer is on the road. After the KCRW broadcast on April 14, 2013, KCRW moved the program from broadcast to webcast only. While the show continues to air on numerous other sources, primarily public radio stations (listed at the end of each show), Shearer expressed dismay over losing his home base radio broadcast, without any notice or being allowed to say goodbye on the air. Shearer has since ended each program by stating that &quot;Le Show&quot; originated from the &quot;&#x27;Change is Hard&#x27; Radio Network&quot;, referring to a press statement from KCRW announcing the show&#x27;s departure from its lineup. At the beginning of the July 14, 2013 episode, Shearer announced that the program is now airing on KCSN, bringing the show back to the Southern California airwaves roughly three months after it was taken off the air at KCRW. While KCSN provides live streaming of the show as well as the archives thereof, WWNO in New Orleans has taken over hosting its broadcast and podcast feeds. In Shearer&#x27;s eyes, this prompted the change to the &quot;&#x27;Change is Easy&#x27; Radio Network&quot; (referring to the city&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Big Easy&quot;).

Several shows a year are broadcast from New Orleans, where Shearer has a residence. The New Orleans shows usually feature very prominent local musicians.

==Availability==
The program is carried on many NPR and other public radio stations throughout the US and abroad. It is also available internationally on NPR Worldwide, the American Forces Radio Network, USEN440 in Japan and over shortwave radio via WBCQ The Planet (7490 kHz). Since the merger of the XM and Sirius satellite radio services into SiriusXM Satellite Radio, the program is no longer available on the merged service; on which Shearer commented, &quot;because I guess, you know, mergers are good&quot;. The program also aired on NPR Berlin from its launch in 2006 through to its 2017 shutdown; it was not picked up by its successor, KCRW Berlin.

The show is also available as podcasts of previous episodes from Shearer&#x27;s website and as free downloadable files from Audible.com, The show is also available as a podcast on iTunes along with other KCRW programs, although KCRW no longer broadcasts the show. The podcasts differ from the broadcast and streaming versions, in that they generally include only a few seconds of the music Shearer spins for the show. Exceptions are musical parodies and original songs written and performed by Shearer.

==News segments==
The show features a number of recurring news segments, each referred to by Shearer as &quot;a copyrighted feature of this broadcast&quot;. Currently many episodes include the following:

* &quot;Apologies of the Week&quot; (public apologies reported in the news)
* &quot;News From Outside the Bubble&quot; (News stories from international sources, usually the UK)

* &quot;Tales of Airport Security&quot; (sent in by listeners)
* &quot;News of News Corp.&quot; (Shearer updates the latest stories about the News Corporation scandal)
**On the October 16, 2011 episode, Shearer renamed the segment &quot;News of Nice Corp.&quot; &quot;... because it&#x27;s not anymore misleading than ...&quot;
* &quot;News of Secrets&quot; Started on March 16, 2014, as News of Secret Stuff, renamed April 13, Shearer discusses material governments try to keep from public view.
* &quot;News of Transparency&quot; Backhanded compliments, failed examples of how the Obama Administration lives up to its announced goal of being the most transparent administration in history.
* &quot;The Year in Rebuke&quot; (The last one or two shows of each year feature repeats of key news-related items, songs and sketches from that year)

==Comedy segments==
There are many recurring comedy sketches or parodies on the program.

===Continental Public Radio===
Shearer often parodies the other programming found on public radio, often as part of a fictional &quot;Continental Public Radio&quot; (CPR). These are populated with such personalities as host Aviva Schlorman, reporter Ira Zipkin, political editor Jonathan Ziziks and others, all voiced by Shearer. Recurring parodies include:
* &quot;All in All&quot; &quot;CPR&#x27;s weekly attempt to bring what&#x27;s behind the news in front of the news and leave it there&quot;
* &quot;At Loggerheads&quot; &quot;Dichotomous dialogue from both sides of the rhetorical divide&quot; (debates on news topics)
* &quot;Book Bag&quot; (Book review program hosted by Ira Zipkin)
* &quot;The Edible Table&quot; (Lampoon of public radio shows such as &quot;The Splendid Table&quot;)
* &quot;Karzai Talk&quot; (Call-in chat show, a satire of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Car Talk&quot; using the fictional Afghanistan Public Radio starring President Hamid Karzai and his brother Ahmed Wali Karzai; After the 2011 assassination of &quot;Wali&quot;, another brother Mahmud Karzai became the co-host. The title and style of the show lampoon NPR&#x27;s Car Talk, of which Shearer has been critical) In 2014 Shearer promoted Karzai Talk T-shirts.
* &quot;Media Nation&quot; &quot;CPR&#x27;s weekly look into the world of the media and the media of the world&quot; (host Chris Edwards is clearly intended to mimic Bob Edwards)
* &quot;More Than You Know&quot; &quot;The weekly public radio series that focuses on events and personalities outside your ken&quot;, host: Jacob Kitzle
* &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot; &quot;An audio encounter with a personality in or out of the news&quot; (Interview program)
* &quot;News from Lake Reverie&quot; (A parody of the &quot;News from Lake Wobegon&quot; segment of A Prairie Home Companion)
* &quot;Up To Here&quot; (Daily news &amp; politics program) &quot;A daily once-over not so lightly on the story at the top, of what&#x27;s behind, today&#x27;s news&quot;, hosted by Milton Getzler
* &quot;What Up, Dog?&quot; &quot;News blogozine for the young and the newsless&quot;; host: Cody Outscoop (Parodies NPR&#x27;s attempts to reach younger audiences such as Bryant Park Project)

===Presidential or political parodies===
Among the many presidential and political parodies are:
* &quot;Alternative Scenario Playhouse&quot; &quot;Duelling dramatizations from radio&#x27;s premiere venue of bifurcated possibilities&quot; (Shearer re-enacts two possible versions of events behind the news)
* &quot;Clintonsomething&quot; (&quot;Youthful angst and middle-aged power!&quot; — a &quot;thirtysomething&quot; parody) Retired at the end of the Clinton administration, reprised as &quot;Clintonsomething: The State Department Years&quot; with the appointment of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State
* &quot;Dick Cheney: Confidential&quot; (parody of hard-boiled detective stories)
* &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; (parody of the 1950s television program, with Barack Obama as the father)
* &quot;41 calls 43&quot; (George H. W. Bush calls George W. Bush)
* &quot;The Gore Room&quot; (Al Gore and Al Franken host a liberal talk radio show; dropped after the liberal Air America radio network, featuring Al Franken, began broadcasting)
* &quot;Hellcats Of The White House&quot; (soap opera parody tales from the Reagan White House, followed by &quot;Hellcats Of The White House: The Bel-Air Years&quot;)
* &quot;Newt Gingrich calls his mom&quot;
* &quot;Nixon in Heaven&quot;

===Other sketches===
Other recurring comedy sketches include:

* &quot;Super Bugs&quot; (stories about antibiotic-resistant bacteria with Superfly-styled theme song, new feature as of October 2011)

===Comedy interviews===

Shearer will interview someone in-studio or via telephone. For the phone interviews, he claims to be opening up the phone for listener calls (even though no phone number was announced) or will reveal that there is an incoming call on &quot;the newsmaker line&quot;. These are among the few comedy segments in which voices other than Shearer&#x27;s are heard. Many are voiced by writer Tom Leopold, who has worked with Shearer on several other projects. These include:
* &quot;Tony Bellalaqua&quot; (a listener in the midwest)
* &quot;Lyle Condit&quot; (Congressman Gary Condit&#x27;s youngest brother)
* &quot;David Feldman&quot; (A high school teacher and friend of Monica Lewinsky)
* &quot;Yvonne Della Femina&quot; (a multiple-sex-change recipient with a storied past)
* &quot;John Walker Lindh&quot; (the so-called &quot;American Taliban&quot;)
* &quot;Elvis Presley&quot; (on the issuance of his U.S. postage stamp)
* &quot;Ira Rifleman&quot; (a listener who allegedly bought a truck owned by Scott Peterson who was convicted of the murder of his wife Laci Peterson)
* &quot;Tyler Michael Tucker&quot; (an actor from a failed TV program)

Other personalities not voiced by Leopold include:
* &quot;David Manning&quot; (the fictitious film reviewer, voiced by a computer voice synthesizer)
* &quot;Ralph the Talking Computer&quot; (a computer synthesized voice)
* &quot;Barry Saint-Martin&quot; aka &quot;Barry Saint-Michael&quot; (actor Alex Lowe)
* &quot;Shabshab&quot; (a former Saddam Hussein lookalike and stereo salesman in Iraq voiced by Shearer)

On very rare occasions Shearer has announced a phone number and taken actual listener calls.

==Interview segments==
A few times each year the show will feature Shearer conducting a serious interview as a major segment of the program, often with a musician who will play music as well. Sometimes these interviews will comprise the bulk of the program, other times they will be interspersed with the usual mix of other segments.

==Segment theme music==
* The show opens with an archival recording of Ben Grauer saying &quot;Here it is&quot;. For years, this was followed by Shearer saying, &quot;From deep inside your radio...&quot; over a fragment of classical music (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Eine kleine Nachtmusik, 4th movement), a parody of the American Public Radio/Public Radio International/Minnesota Public Radio intro featuring the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6, 3rd movement by Bach. The opener was modified starting with December 13, 2015 episode with Shearer saying &quot;From deep inside your audio device of choice...&quot; over a fragment of contemporary electronic music. 
* A looped sample of &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot; by Paul McCartney is used for &quot;Apologies of the Week&quot;, with emphasis on McCartney saying &quot;sorry&quot;.
* Glenn Yarbrough singing the Rod McKuen song &quot;Listen to the Warm&quot; is used for &quot;News of the Warm&quot;.
* Joe Satriani playing &quot;Summer Song&quot; (from the album &quot;The Extremist&quot;) is the theme for &quot;(Inside) Extra Access Tonight&quot;
* The Beatles instrumental &quot;Flying&quot; (from the album &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;) is the theme for &quot;Tales of Airport Security&quot;
* The segments &quot;F is for FEMA&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Dog Trainer Corrections&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Scared&quot;, &quot;News from the Digital Wonderland&quot;, &quot;News of Inspectors General&quot; and &quot;Clean, Safe, Too Cheap to Meter&quot; use original music recorded and sung by Shearer.
* &quot;Clintonsomething&quot; uses the original theme music from the TV series thirtysomething.
* &quot;The Trades&quot; uses &quot;Rut&quot; by Carla Bley, from the CD &quot;Nightglo&quot; on ECM
* &quot;News of Transparency&quot; uses a Shearer produced version of another Beatles song &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot;
* &quot;News of Clowns&quot; at first used an instrumental version of &quot;Be a Clown&quot;, but switched to &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot; by Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles (from the album &quot;Make It Happen&quot;)

==Criticism==
On July 2, 2006, Wisconsin Public Radio cancelled &quot;Le Show&quot; as part of a revamp of the network&#x27;s programming. On the July 16 edition of the program, Shearer claimed WPR was &quot;displeased with the political content of the broadcast&quot;. WPR Director of Radio Phil Corriveau told the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; that the program&#x27;s political content was a minor factor and the decision had to do with &quot;Le Show&quot;&#x27;s consistency: &quot;I think he&#x27;s brilliant. But I think if you listen to the show, they can be brilliant, or they can really ramble on.&quot;

<text>The General Association of General Baptists is a Baptist Christian denomination in the United States. It is affiliated with the National Association of Evangelicals and the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters are located in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, where they operate Stinson Press. 

A distinct belief is the general atonement (that Christ died for all persons).

==History==
Though theologically similar to the General Baptists in England and early America, this body of General Baptists arose in the Midwestern United States in the 19th century through the work of Benoni Stinson (1798-1869), a United Baptist minister first in Kentucky and then in Indiana. Stinson was ordained in Kentucky in 1821, and evidently was already leaning toward or embracing Arminian theology. Shortly after he moved to Indiana, in 1822 the Wabash District Association decided to divide into two bodies, for convenience sake. Stinson&#x27;s church would be in the new body, and he labored to have a statement that &quot;the preaching that Christ tasted death for every man shall be no bar to fellowship&quot; would be included in the articles of faith. The next fall, in 1823, the Liberty Baptist Church of Howell, Indiana was organized with 33 members, and Elder Stinson was called as pastor. Three other churches were soon organized, all in the Evansville, Indiana area. In October 1824, representatives from these four churches came together and organized the &quot;Liberty Association of General Baptists&quot;. This appears to be the first time the name &quot;General&quot; was officially associated with this movement. A number of &quot;General Baptist&quot; local associations were organized from 1824 to 1870. During this period, some attempts were made by the Liberty Association to correspond with the northern Free Will Baptists, but this appears to have eventually proved unsatisfactory to both parties. In 1870, a convention was called to meet with Harmony Church, Gallatin County, Illinois, with the idea of organizing a general association comprising all the annual General Baptist associations. Delegates from Liberty, Mt. Olivet and Ohio associations gathered and formed the &quot;General Association of General Baptists&quot;. 

According to a denomination census released in 2023, it claimed 47,193 members and 793 churches. 

The official denominational publication is &quot;The General Baptist Messenger&quot;. The General Association oversees publication of Sunday School literature, a home mission board, a foreign mission board, and the Oakland City University in Oakland City, Indiana.

<doc id="341005" wikidata="Q2291287" url="?curid=341005" title="Einstein on the Beach">
<text>Einstein on the Beach is an opera in four acts composed by Philip Glass with libretto in collaboration with Robert Wilson, who also designed and directed early productions. The opera eschews traditional narrative in favor of a formalist approach based on structured spaces laid out by Wilson in a series of storyboards which are framed and connected by five &quot;knee plays&quot; or intermezzos. The music was written &quot;in the spring, summer and fall of 1975.&quot;&quot;mostly in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.&quot; Glass recounts the collaborative process: &quot;I put [Wilson’s notebook of sketches] on the piano and composed each section like a portrait of the drawing before me. The score was begun in the spring of 1975 and completed by the following November, and those drawings were before me all the time.&quot; 

The opera&#x27;s premiere occurred on July 25, 1976, at the Théâtre Municipal in Avignon, France, as part of the Avignon Festival. The opera contains writings by Christopher Knowles, Samuel M. Johnson and Lucinda Childs. It is Glass&#x27;s first and longest opera score, taking approximately five hours in full performance without intermission; given the length, the audience is permitted to enter and leave as desired.

The work became the first in Glass&#x27;s thematically related Portrait Trilogy, along with &quot;Satyagraha&quot; (1979), and &quot;Akhnaten&quot; (1983). These three operas were described by Glass as portraits of people whose personal vision transformed the thinking of their times through the power of ideas rather than by military force.

== Composition and performance history ==
Glass and Wilson first met to discuss the prospects of a collaborative work, and decided on an opera of between four and five hours in length based around a historical persona. Wilson initially suggested Charlie Chaplin or Adolf Hitler, whom Glass outright rejected, while Glass proposed Mahatma Gandhi (later the central figure of his 1979 opera &quot;Satyagraha&quot;). Albert Einstein was the eventual compromise.
The title appears to reference the apocalyptic novel &quot;On the Beach&quot; by Nevil Shute. The opera was originally to be titled &quot;Einstein on the Beach on Wall Street&quot; but was later shortened; neither Glass nor Wilson remember when or why.

===1976 premiere and first tour===

&quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; premiered on July 25, 1976, at the Théâtre Municipal in Avignon, France, as part of the Avignon Festival. It was performed by the Philip Glass Ensemble and presented by the Byrd Hoffmann Foundation. The opera was also staged that summer in Hamburg, Paris, Belgrade, Venice, Brussels and Rotterdam. The Byrd Hoffman Foundation in cooperation with the Metropolitan Opera held two performances in November 1976. Lucinda Childs, Robert Wilson, pupil Sheryl S. Sutton, and Samuel M. Johnson filled the primary characters. All three would go on to reappear in the 1984 BAM revival.

===1980s===
The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) next mounted the opera in 1984. A one-hour documentary about this production appeared on public television, titled &quot;Einstein on the Beach: The Changing Image of Opera&quot;.

In 1988, opera director Achim Freyer, who had staged the world premiere of Glass&#x27;s &quot;Akhnaten&quot; in Stuttgart, Germany in 1984, designed and staged a reworked version in a highly abstract style, with new spoken texts from the early 20th century, at the Stuttgart State Opera. As with the premiere, this version was also conducted by Michael Riesman.

===1990s===
In 1992, a revival was mounted by International Production Associates that included the participation of Wilson, Glass and Childs. The production was re-staged at the McCarter Theatre at Princeton University. It subsequently toured to Frankfurt, Melbourne, Barcelona, Madrid, Tokyo, Brooklyn (BAM), and Paris.

===2000s===
In 2007, Carnegie Hall presented a concert version of &quot;Einstein&quot; in which violinist Tim Fain appeared as soloist. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote about his performance, &quot;And Tim Fain, the violinist, gave the solo passages in the second, fourth and fifth &#x27;Knee Plays&#x27; and in the climactic, swirling &#x27;Spaceship Interior&#x27; scene an electrifying, virtuosic workout.&quot; Fain tours extensively with Philip Glass in duo recitals and they always include the solo from &quot;Knee Play 2&quot; on their program.

===2010s===

A revival with the participation of all the original collaborators was commissioned by the New York City Opera (NYCO) to open their 2009–10 season. When General Manager designate Gerard Mortier withdrew from NYCO, the revival, along with the rest of Mortier&#x27;s programming, was canceled.

The team that had organized the New York City Opera production put together another group to remount &quot;Einstein&quot;, under the management of Pomegranate Arts. After a month of rehearsals overseen by Glass, Wilson and Childs, the first performance in 20 years took place on January 20, 2012, presented by the University Musical Society at the Power Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Two additional performances that weekend followed. The performance featured Kate Moran and Helga Davis replacing Childs&#x27; and Sutton&#x27;s roles respectively. Grammy Award-nominated violinist Jennifer Koh played the role of Einstein in the preview and alternated with Antoine Silverman for the subsequent tour. The other instrumental performers and solfege soprano for these performances are the current members of the Philip Glass Ensemble without Glass himself performing. The performers in the 2012 production included members of the Lucinda Childs Dance Company: Ty Boomershine, Vincent McCloskey, Matthew Pardo, Patrick O&#x27;Neill, Stuart Singer, Lonnie Poupard, Caitlin Scranton, Sharon Milanese, Katie Dorn, Katherine Helen Fisher, Anne Lewis, Shakirah Stewart, and Sarah Hillmon. The chorus for this revival was composed of sopranos Michèle Eaton, Melanie Russell, Lindsay Kesselman; altos Hai-Ting Chinn, Solange Merdinian, Kate Maroney; tenors John Kawa, Philip Anderson, Tomas Cruz; and basses Greg Purnhagen, Joe Damon Chappel, and Jason Charles Walker.

The official tour began on March 16, 2012 after a single preview the previous evening with the premiere at the Opéra Berlioz in Montpellier, France. This was followed by performances at the Teatro Valli in Reggio Emilia, Italy; the Barbican Centre, London; the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts, Toronto; the Brooklyn Academy of Music Brooklyn, New York; Zellerbach Hall at the University of California, Berkeley, California; the Teatro del Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico City: in 2013, at Het Muziektheater/De Nederlandse Opera, Amsterdam; Hong Kong; Arts Centre Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Los Angeles Opera, Los Angeles: and, in 2014 there were performances in Paris and Berlin. In October 2015 this production came to an end with performances in Gwangju, South Korea.

This touring production of &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; was commissioned by: BAM; the Barbican, London; Cal Performances with the University of California, Berkeley; Luminato – Toronto Festival of Arts and Creativity; De Nederlandse Opera/The Amsterdam Music Theatre; Opéra national de Montpellier Languedoc-Roussillon; and the University Musical Society of the University of Michigan.

Carolina Crown&#x27;s 2013 Drum Corps International Championship production &quot;E = mc2&quot; included selections of the opera.

Culturebox, a digital production dedicated to cultural content for French Television, streamed a live performance from Théâtre du Châtelet on January 7, 2014, and made it available as streaming video for the next six months only. This was the first time the opera was filmed.

A new staging of &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; premiered at the Opernhaus Dortmund, Germany, in April 2017. It was directed by and was the first production without Glass or Wilson personally involved. The opera was also staged at the Grand Théâtre de Genève in 2019 as part of La Batie performing arts festival. That production was directed by .

== Synopsis ==
From the beginning of Glass and Wilson&#x27;s collaboration, they insisted on portraying the icon purely as a historical figure, in the absence of a storyline attached to his image. While they did incorporate symbols from Einstein&#x27;s life within the opera&#x27;s scenery, characters, and music, they intentionally chose not to give the opera a specific plot. This is in accord with Wilson&#x27;s formalist approach, which he asserts creates more truth on stage than naturalist theater. Wilson structured &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; as a repeating sequence of three different kinds of space. Between major acts are shorter entr&#x27;actes known as &quot;knee plays,&quot; a signature technique that Wilson has applied throughout his oeuvre. Propelling idea of &quot;non-plot&quot; within &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, its libretto employs solfège syllables, numbers, and short sections of poetry. In an interview, Glass comments that he originally intended for his audience to construct personal connections with Einstein as a character and with the music that he assigns to the icon. For example, the music within the first of the opera&#x27;s &quot;Knee Plays&quot; features repeated numbers accompanied by an electric organ. Glass states that these numbers and solfège syllables were used as placeholders for texts by the singers to memorize their parts, and were kept instead of replacing them with texts. This numerical repetition, however, offers an interpretation as a reference to the mathematical and scientific breakthroughs made by Einstein himself. Of further reference to the icon&#x27;s image, everything on the originally staged set of &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, from costumes to lighting, depicts specific aspects that refer to Einstein&#x27;s life.

Overall, the music assigned to &quot;Einstein&quot; demonstrates a circular process, a repeating cycle that constantly delays resolution. This process uses both additive and subtractive formulas. The three main scenes within the opera—&quot;Train&quot;, &quot;Trial&quot;, and &quot;Field/Spaceship&quot;—allude to Einstein&#x27;s hypotheses about his theory of relativity and his unified field theory. Specifically, themes within the opera allude to nuclear weapons, science, and AM radio.

The opera consists of nine connected 20-minute scenes in four acts separated by &quot;Knee Plays&quot;. Five &quot;Knee Plays&quot; frame the opera&#x27;s structure and appear in between acts, while also functioning as the opening and closing scenes. Glass defines a &quot;Knee Play&quot; as an interlude between acts and as &quot;the &#x27;knee&#x27; referring to the joining function that humans&#x27; anatomical knees perform&quot;. While the &quot;Knee Plays&quot; helped to create the necessary time to change the scenery of Wilson&#x27;s seven sets, these interludes also served a musical function. David Cunningham, a Glass scholar, writes that the intermittence of Glass&#x27;s &quot;Knee Plays&quot; amongst the opera&#x27;s four acts, serves as a &quot;constant motif in the whole work&quot;.

The opera requires a cast of two female, one male, and one male child in speaking roles (for the Wilson production); a 16-person SATB chamber chorus with an outstanding soprano soloist and a smaller tenor solo part; three reed players: flute (doubling piccolo and bass clarinet), soprano saxophone (doubling flute), tenor saxophone (doubling alto saxophone and flute); solo violin, and two synthesizers/electronic organs. The orchestration was originally tailored to the five members of the Philip Glass Ensemble, plus the solo violin.

== Recordings ==

Four &quot;complete&quot; recordings of the opera have been made: the first in 1978, initially released on the Tomato label (TOM-4-2901) in 1979, and later reissued by CBS Masterworks, followed by Sony Classical (both M4K 38875); the second in 1993, released that same year on the Nonesuch label (79323). The 1978 recording was held to 165 minutes in order to fit onto four LP records, i.e., the opening scene&#x27;s repeats were considerably shortened. The 1993 recording encompassed 200 minutes, freed by the technology of the compact disc, although it was released on &quot;three&quot; CDs instead of the original&#x27;s four.

Michael Riesman conducted both of the first two recordings. In 1978, Lucinda Childs, Sheryl Sutton, Paul Mann, and Samuel M. Johnson performed the opera&#x27;s texts, with Philip Glass Ensemble performer Iris Hiskey taking the soprano solo. In 1993 Childs and Sutton repeated their roles, while Gregory Dolbashian and Jasper McGruder replaced Mann and the late Mr. Johnson&#x27;s roles respectively; Patricia Schuman sang the soprano role. Most of the participants in the Nonesuch recording had performed in &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; during its 1992 world tour. 

A third recording was taped live during the 1984 Brooklyn Academy of Music production run. This was released by Philip Glass&#x27;s personal label Orange Mountain Music in early September 2012, as a 77-minute highlights CD, accompanied by the &quot;Changing Image of Opera&quot; documentary on DVD. The complete and unedited version, 217 minutes long, was also made available at the same time but only as a download, and later on streaming services. 

The fourth, a 270-minute recording from January 2014 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris was released on DVD and Blu-ray in October 2016.

In October 2013, Pacifica Radio released a two disc set of a 1976 interview with Glass and Wilson conducted at The Kitchen and excerpts from a rehearsal of some excerpts from the opera, also performed at The Kitchen on March 19, 1976.

The violin part for the work has been performed by Robert Brown (in the live 1976 production), Paul Zukofsky (in the 1979 recording), Tison Street (in the live 1984 production), Gregory Fulkerson (in the live 1992 production and 1993 recording) and an interchanging performance of Jennifer Koh and Antoine Silverman during the 2012/16 production.

A shortened version of &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot;, along with three other pieces from the opera, were chosen to appear on the Philip Glass album &quot;Songs from the Trilogy&quot;.

Anton Batagov recorded 3 transcription pieces (Scene 2 – Trail 1 from act 1, scene 2 – Night Train from act 2 and Knee Play 5) from this work on solo piano in his album &quot;Prophecies&quot; (2016, on Orange Mountain Music label).

== In popular culture ==
The title was used as inspiration for the 1994 Counting Crows song &quot;Einstein on the Beach (For an Eggman)&quot;.

Excerpts were used as background music for several shots in season 3, episode 5 (2017) of the &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; television series.

In the episode &quot;Out with Dad&quot; of the TV series &quot;Frasier&quot;, the title character, an opera lover, says, &quot;You see, there&#x27;s a stunning woman who comes to the opera on the same nights we do. She has the box right across from ours. We&#x27;ve flirted a bit from a distance. I have laughed with her during &quot;Figaro&quot;, cried with her during &quot;Tosca&quot;. I even had a dream about her during &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;.&quot;

Excerpts from the movement &quot;Knee Play 1&quot; are played during a montage sequence in the 2005 Alex Gibney documentary film &quot;&quot;.

An edited version of &quot;Knee Play 1&quot; was also used in the launch advertisement for Orange S.A. in 1994.

At the 2013 Drum Corps International World Championship, the first-place winners, Carolina Crown, earned a perfect score in the brass section when they performed parts of &quot;Knee Play 3&quot;, &quot;Trial/Prison&quot;, &quot;Spaceship&quot;, and &quot;Knee Play 5&quot;.

Among the works of Peter Schickele&#x27;s fictitious alter ego P.D.Q. Bach is one called &quot;Einstein on the Fritz&quot; (S. E=mc2). Schickele was a friend of Philip and was a Juilliard classmate of his.

Helen Pickett&#x27;s 2012 &quot;When Love&quot; created on the Dance Theatre of Harlem uses Knee Play 5.

<doc id="341011" wikidata="Q17069020" url="?curid=341011" title="Lift Every Voice and Sing">
<text>&quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; is a hymn with lyrics by James Weldon Johnson (1871–1938) and set to music by his brother, J. Rosamond Johnson (1873–1954). Written from the context of African Americans in the late 19th century, the hymn is a prayer of thanksgiving to God as well as a prayer for faithfulness and freedom, with imagery that evokes the biblical Exodus from slavery to the freedom of the &quot;promised land&quot;.

Premiered in 1900, &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; was communally sung within Black American communities, while the NAACP began to promote the hymn as a &quot;[[Negro]] national anthem&quot; in 1917 (with the term &quot;Black national anthem&quot; similarly used in the present day). It has been featured in 42 different Christian hymnals, and it has also been performed by various African American singers and musicians. Its prominence has increased since 2020 following the George Floyd protests.

==History==
James Weldon Johnson, Principal of the Edwin M. Stanton School in Jacksonville, Florida, had sought to write a poem in commemoration of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s birthday. However, amid the ongoing civil rights movement, Johnson decided to write a poem which was themed around the struggles of African Americans following the Reconstruction era (including the passage of Jim Crow laws in the South). &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; was first recited by 500 students in 1900. His brother J. Rosamond Johnson would later set the poem to music.

After the Great Fire of 1901, the Johnsons moved to New York City to pursue a career on Broadway. In the years that followed, &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; was sung within Black communities; Johnson wrote that &quot;the school children of Jacksonville kept singing it; they went off to other schools and sang it; they became teachers and taught it to other children. Within twenty years it was being sung over the South and in some other parts of the country&quot;.

== Recognition ==
A sculpture by Augusta Savage named after the song was exhibited at 
the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, taking the form of a choir of children shaped into a harp. Savage was the only Black woman commissioned for the Fair, and the sculpture (which was retitled &quot;The Harp&quot; by organizers) was also sold as miniature replicas and on postcards during the event. Like other temporary installations, the sculpture was destroyed at the close of the fair.

=== As the &quot;Negro national anthem&quot; ===
In 1919, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) dubbed &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; the &quot;Negro national anthem&quot;, for its power in voicing a cry for liberation and affirmation for African American people. James Weldon Johnson would be appointed to serve as the NAACP&#x27;s first executive secretary the following year. It has similarly been referred to as &quot;the Black national anthem&quot;.

The use of the term &quot;the Black national anthem&quot; in reference to &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; has been criticized. Timothy Askew, an associate professor at the historically Black Clark Atlanta University, argued that the use of the term &quot;Black national anthem&quot; could incorrectly implicate a desire of separatism by Black communities, that the lyrics of the hymn do not overtly refer to any specific race (which has inspired people to perform it outside African American communities), and &quot;identity should be developed by the individual himself, not by a group of people who think they know what is best for you&quot;. Some Conservative commentators have similarly criticized performances and references to &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; as the &quot;Black national anthem&quot; as separatist and diminishing to &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as the national anthem of the United States.

In response to Askew&#x27;s remarks, the NAACP&#x27;s then-senior vice president of advocacy and policy Hilary O. Shelton told CNN that the hymn &quot;was adopted and welcomed by a very interracial group, and it speaks of hope in being full first-class citizens in our society&quot;, used in conjunction with the U.S. national anthem or the Pledge of Allegiance during public events, &quot;It is evident in our actions as an organization and here in America it is evidence that we are about inclusion, not exclusion. To claim that we as African-Americans want to form a confederation or separate ourselves from white people because of one song is baffling to me.&quot;

In January 2021, Representative and then-House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn sponsored HR 301, a bill that proposed that &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; be designated as the national hymn of the United States. Other songs have been proposed to become the national hymn of the United States in the past, and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; would have remained the national anthem.

==Notable references and performances==
In 1923, the male gospel group Manhattan Harmony Four recorded the hymn as &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing (National Negro Anthem)&quot;. It was added to the National Recording Registry in 2016.

In Maya Angelou&#x27;s 1969 autobiography, &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, the hymn is sung by the audience and students at Maya&#x27;s eighth-grade graduation ceremony, after a white school official dashes the educational aspirations of her classmates.

In 1972, Kim Weston sang the hymn as the opening number for the Wattstax Festival at the Coliseum in Los Angeles. This performance was included in the film &quot;Wattstax&quot; which was produced by Wolper Films. The musical direction and recording were both overseen by Stax Records engineer Terry Manning.

In 1975, James Brown quoted a lyric from the hymn as part of his performance of the U.S. national anthem before the Muhammad Ali vs. Chuck Wepner boxing match.

In 1990, singer Melba Moore released a modern rendition of the hymn, which she recorded with the assistance of other singers, including R&amp;B artists Stephanie Mills, Freddie Jackson, Anita Baker, Dionne Warwick, Bobby Brown, Stevie Wonder, Jeffrey Osborne, and Howard Hewett; and gospel artists BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans, Take 6, and The Clark Sisters, after which, &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; was entered into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; by Del. Walter Fauntroy (D-DC). It was also added to the National Recording Registry in 2016.

In 2008, jazz singer Rene Marie was asked to sing the national anthem at a civic event in Denver, Colorado, where she caused a controversy by substituting the words of &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; into the song. This arrangement of the words of &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; with the melody of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; became part of the titular suite on her 2011 CD release, &quot;The Voice of My Beautiful Country&quot;.

On January 20, 2009, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, a civil rights movement leader who co-founded and is a former president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, used a near-verbatim recitation of the hymn&#x27;s third stanza to begin his benediction at the inauguration ceremony for President Barack Obama.

Jon Batiste, former bandleader of the late-night talk show &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, occasionally worked &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; into the music that was played by his band Stay Human when the program hosted a Black guest; he stated that the hymn &quot;connects us to the history of all the people who we stand on the shoulders of—who have marched and fought and died for the freedoms we enjoy and that we&#x27;re trying to improve upon&quot;.
On September 24, 2016, the hymn was sung by mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves and chorus at the conclusion of the opening ceremonies of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, at which Obama delivered the keynote address.

On October 19, 2017, when White supremacist leader Richard Spencer spoke at the University of Florida, music professor Laura Ellis played &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; on the university&#x27;s carillon to convey a message of unity.

On April 14, 2018, &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; was sung by Beyoncé during her headlining performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

In May 2018, the Tabernacle Choir performed &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; during an edition of &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot; attended by members of the NAACP, who were in Salt Lake City for a national leadership meeting. 

The song was featured as the opening and closing song of &quot;The Blues and Its People&quot;, a suite by Russell Gunn first performed on February 18, 2023, at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater to mark the 50th anniversary of Amiri Baraka&#x27;s book &quot;Blues People: Negro Music in White America&quot;.

=== Prominence after the George Floyd protests ===
In mid-2020, &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; began to receive renewed attention amid nationwide protests over the police murder of George Floyd, which became a cause célèbre for what protesters considered brutal policing of the Black community: it was sung during demonstrations and other events which were held in solidarity. Presidential candidate Joe Biden referenced the hymn in his action plan for addressing perceived racial disparities in the United States, which was titled &quot;Lift Every Voice: The Biden Plan for Black America&quot;. On June 19, 2020, Google featured a Juneteenth-themed animation on its home page, set to a spoken word rendition of the hymn&#x27;s first verse by LeVar Burton. In 2021, Vanessa Williams sang &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; on the PBS Independence Day special &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot;, commemorating the recognition of Juneteenth as a federal holiday. 

The hymn also began to be incorporated into sporting events: during NASCAR&#x27;s 2020 Pocono 350, musicians Mike Phillips and West Byrd quoted &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; as part of their rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, while the National Football League announced that &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; would be played or performed as part of the pre-game ceremonies of all Week 1 games during the 2020 season. The decision came as part of a new social justice campaign being introduced by the NFL, stemming from the league&#x27;s acknowledgements of the Black Lives Matter movement, and its handling of players taking a knee during the singing of the national anthem in order to protest against racial inequality and police brutality. The NFL&#x27;s opening night kickoff game featured a filmed performance of the hymn by Alicia Keys at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which was later replayed as part of the pre-game show of Super Bowl LV on February 7, 2021. 

The NFL stated that it would again feature the hymn at Week 1 games and other &quot;tentpole&quot; events (including the NFL Draft and playoff games) during the 2021 season. Some African American fans who were interviewed by NBC News felt that the NFL&#x27;s decision was &quot;pandering&quot; that would not have a material impact on the league&#x27;s pursuits of social justice. , the song has been performed at five consecutive Super Bowl pregame ceremonies.

<doc id="341015" wikidata="Q1050404" url="?curid=341015" title="Sparse matrix">
<text>In numerical analysis and scientific computing, a sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. There is no strict definition regarding the proportion of zero-value elements for a matrix to qualify as sparse but a common criterion is that the number of non-zero elements is roughly equal to the number of rows or columns. By contrast, if most of the elements are non-zero, the matrix is considered dense. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; for an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix) is sometimes referred to as the sparsity of the matrix.

Conceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions. For example, consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next: this is a sparse system, as only adjacent balls are coupled. By contrast, if the same line of balls were to have springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in combinatorics and application areas such as network theory and numerical analysis, which typically have a low density of significant data or connections. Large sparse matrices often appear in scientific or engineering applications when solving partial differential equations.

When storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a computer, it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized algorithms and data structures that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix. Specialized computers have been made for sparse matrices, as they are common in the machine learning field. Operations using standard dense-matrix structures and algorithms are slow and inefficient when applied to large sparse matrices as processing and memory are wasted on the zeros. Sparse data is by nature more easily compressed and thus requires significantly less storage. Some very large sparse matrices are infeasible to manipulate using standard dense-matrix algorithms.

==Special cases==

===Banded===

An important special type of sparse matrices is band matrix, defined as follows. The lower bandwidth of a matrix is the smallest number such that the entry vanishes whenever . Similarly, the upper bandwidth is the smallest number such that whenever . For example, a tridiagonal matrix has lower bandwidth and upper bandwidth . As another example, the following sparse matrix has lower and upper bandwidth both equal to 3. Notice that zeros are represented with dots for clarity.
formula_1

Matrices with reasonably small upper and lower bandwidth are known as band matrices and often lend themselves to simpler algorithms than general sparse matrices; or one can sometimes apply dense matrix algorithms and gain efficiency simply by looping over a reduced number of indices.

By rearranging the rows and columns of a matrix it may be possible to obtain a matrix with a lower bandwidth. A number of algorithms are designed for bandwidth minimization.

====Diagonal====
A very efficient structure for an extreme case of band matrices, the &quot;diagonal matrix&quot;, is to store just the entries in the main diagonal as a one-dimensional array, so a diagonal matrix requires only entries.

===Symmetric===
A symmetric sparse matrix arises as the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph; it can be stored efficiently as an adjacency list.

===Block diagonal===
A block-diagonal matrix consists of sub-matrices along its diagonal blocks. A block-diagonal matrix has the form
formula_2

where is a square matrix for all .

==Use==

===Reducing fill-in===

The &quot;fill-in&quot; of a matrix are those entries that change from an initial zero to a non-zero value during the execution of an algorithm. To reduce the memory requirements and the number of arithmetic operations used during an algorithm, it is useful to minimize the fill-in by switching rows and columns in the matrix. The symbolic Cholesky decomposition can be used to calculate the worst possible fill-in before doing the actual Cholesky decomposition.

There are other methods than the Cholesky decomposition in use. Orthogonalization methods (such as QR factorization) are common, for example, when solving problems by least squares methods. While the theoretical fill-in is still the same, in practical terms the &quot;false non-zeros&quot; can be different for different methods. And symbolic versions of those algorithms can be used in the same manner as the symbolic Cholesky to compute worst case fill-in.

===Solving sparse matrix equations===

Both iterative and direct methods exist for sparse matrix solving.

Iterative methods, such as conjugate gradient method and GMRES utilize fast computations of matrix-vector products formula_3, where matrix formula_4 is sparse. The use of preconditioners can significantly accelerate convergence of such iterative methods.

A matrix is typically stored as a two-dimensional array. Each entry in the array represents an element of the matrix and is accessed by the two indices and . Conventionally, is the row index, numbered from top to bottom, and is the column index, numbered from left to right. For an matrix, the amount of memory required to store the matrix in this format is proportional to (disregarding the fact that the dimensions of the matrix also need to be stored).

In the case of a sparse matrix, substantial memory requirement reductions can be realized by storing only the non-zero entries. Depending on the number and distribution of the non-zero entries, different data structures can be used and yield huge savings in memory when compared to the basic approach. The trade-off is that accessing the individual elements becomes more complex and additional structures are needed to be able to recover the original matrix unambiguously.

Formats can be divided into two groups:

* Those that support efficient modification, such as DOK (Dictionary of keys), LIL (List of lists), or COO (Coordinate list). These are typically used to construct the matrices.
* Those that support efficient access and matrix operations, such as CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) or CSC (Compressed Sparse Column).

===Dictionary of keys (DOK)===

DOK consists of a dictionary that maps -pairs to the value of the elements. Elements that are missing from the dictionary are taken to be zero. The format is good for incrementally constructing a sparse matrix in random order, but poor for iterating over non-zero values in lexicographical order. One typically constructs a matrix in this format and then converts to another more efficient format for processing.

===List of lists (LIL)===

LIL stores one list per row, with each entry containing the column index and the value. Typically, these entries are kept sorted by column index for faster lookup. This is another format good for incremental matrix construction.

===Coordinate list (COO)===

COO stores a list of tuples. Ideally, the entries are sorted first by row index and then by column index, to improve random access times. This is another format that is good for incremental matrix construction.

===Compressed sparse row (CSR, CRS or Yale format)===

The &quot;compressed sparse row&quot; (CSR) or &quot;compressed row storage&quot; (CRS) or Yale format represents a matrix by three (one-dimensional) arrays, that respectively contain nonzero values, the extents of rows, and column indices. It is similar to COO, but compresses the row indices, hence the name. This format allows fast row access and matrix-vector multiplications (). The CSR format has been in use since at least the mid-1960s, with the first complete description appearing in 1967.

The CSR format stores a sparse matrix in row form using three (one-dimensional) arrays . Let denote the number of nonzero entries in . (Note that zero-based indices shall be used here.)

* The arrays and are of length , and contain the non-zero values and the column indices of those values respectively
* contains the column in which the corresponding entry is located.
* The array is of length and encodes the index in and where the given row starts. This is equivalent to encoding the total number of nonzeros above row . The last element is , i.e., the fictitious index in immediately after the last valid index .

For example, the matrix
formula_5
is a matrix with 4 nonzero elements, hence
 V = [ 5 8 3 6 ]
 COL_INDEX = [ 0 1 2 1 ]
 ROW_INDEX = [ 0 1 2 3 4 ] 
assuming a zero-indexed language.

To extract a row, we first define:
 row_start = ROW_INDEX[row]
 row_end = ROW_INDEX[row + 1]

Then we take slices from V and COL_INDEX starting at row_start and ending at row_end.

To extract the row 1 (the second row) of this matrix we set codice_1 and codice_2. Then we make the slices codice_3 and codice_4. We now know that in row 1 we have one element at column 1 with value 8.

In this case the CSR representation contains 13 entries, compared to 16 in the original matrix. The CSR format saves on memory only when .

Another example, the matrix
formula_6
is a matrix (24 entries) with 8 nonzero elements, so
 V = [ 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 ]
 COL_INDEX = [ 0 1 1 3 2 3 4 5 ] 
 ROW_INDEX = [ 0 2 4 7 8 ]

The whole is stored as 21 entries: 8 in , 8 in , and 5 in .

* splits the array into rows: codice_5, indicating the index of (and ) where each row starts and ends;
* aligns values in columns: codice_6.

Note that in this format, the first value of is always zero and the last is always , so they are in some sense redundant (although in programming languages where the array length needs to be explicitly stored, would not be redundant). Nonetheless, this does avoid the need to handle an exceptional case when computing the length of each row, as it guarantees the formula works for any row . Moreover, the memory cost of this redundant storage is likely insignificant for a sufficiently large matrix.

The (old and new) Yale sparse matrix formats are instances of the CSR scheme. The old Yale format works exactly as described above, with three arrays; the new format combines and into a single array and handles the diagonal of the matrix separately.

For logical adjacency matrices, the data array can be omitted, as the existence of an entry in the row array is sufficient to model a binary adjacency relation.

It is likely known as the Yale format because it was proposed in the 1977 Yale Sparse Matrix Package report from Department of Computer Science at Yale University.

===Compressed sparse column (CSC or CCS)===
CSC is similar to CSR except that values are read first by column, a row index is stored for each value, and column pointers are stored. For example, CSC is , where is an array of the (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) non-zero values of the matrix; is the row indices corresponding to the values; and, is the list of indexes where each column starts. The name is based on the fact that column index information is compressed relative to the COO format. One typically uses another format (LIL, DOK, COO) for construction. This format is efficient for arithmetic operations, column slicing, and matrix-vector products. This is the traditional format for specifying a sparse matrix in MATLAB (via the codice_7 function).

<doc id="341017" wikidata="Q146118" url="?curid=341017" title="Pelargonium">
<text>Pelargonium () is a genus of flowering plants that includes about 280 species of perennials, succulents, and shrubs, commonly called geraniums, pelargoniums, or storksbills. &quot;Geranium&quot; is also the botanical name and common name of a separate genus of related plants, also known as cranesbills. Both genera belong to the family Geraniaceae, and Carl Linnaeus originally included all the species in one genus, &quot;Geranium&quot;; they were later separated into two genera by Charles Louis L&#x27;Héritier de Brutelle in 1789.

While &quot;Geranium&quot; species are mostly temperate herbaceous plants, dying down in winter, &quot;Pelargonium&quot; species are evergreen perennials indigenous to warm temperate and tropical regions of the world, with many species in southern Africa. They are drought and heat tolerant but can tolerate only minor frosts. Some species are extremely popular garden plants, grown as houseplants and bedding plants in temperate regions. They have a long flowering period, with flowers mostly in red, orange, or white, but intensive breeding has produced a huge array of cultivars with great variety in size, flower colour, leaf form and aromatic foliage.

== Description ==

&quot;Pelargonium&quot; occurs in a large number of growth forms, including herbaceous annuals, shrubs, subshrubs, stem succulents and geophytes. The erect stems bear five-petaled flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are occasionally branched. Because not all flowers appear simultaneously, but open from the centre outwards, this is a form of inflorescence is referred to as pseudoumbels.

The flower has a single symmetry plane (zygomorphic), which distinguishes it from the &quot;Geranium&quot; flower, which has radial symmetry (actinomorphic). Thus the lower three (anterior) petals are differentiated from the upper two (posterior) petals. The posterior sepal is fused with the pedicel to form a hypanthium (nectary tube). The nectary tube varies from only a few millimeters, up to several centimeters, and is an important floral characteristic in morphological classification. Stamens vary from 2 to 7, and their number, position relative to staminodes, and curvature are used to identify individual species. There are five stigmata in the style. For the considerable diversity in flower morphology, see figure 1 of Röschenbleck &quot;et al.&quot; (2014).

Leaves are usually alternate, and palmately lobed or pinnate, often on long stalks, and sometimes with light or dark patterns. The leaves of &quot;Pelargonium peltatum&quot; (Ivy-leaved Geranium), have a thick cuticle better adapting them for drought tolerance.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Pelargonium&quot; is the second largest genus (after &quot;Geranium&quot;) within the family Geraniaceae, within which it is sister to the remaining genera of the family in its strict sense, &quot;Erodium&quot;, &quot;Geranium&quot;, and &quot;Monsonia&quot; including &quot;Sarcocaulon&quot;. The Geraniaceae have a number of genetic features unique amongst angiosperms, including highly rearranged plastid genomes differing in gene content, order and expansion of the inverted repeat.

===Genus history===
The name &quot;Pelargonium&quot; was first proposed by Dillenius in 1732,{{sfn|Dillenius|1732|loc=De Geraniorum Differentiis p. 149}} who described and illustrated seven species of geraniums from South Africa that are now classified as &quot;Pelargonium&quot;.{{sfn|Lis-Balchin|2002|loc=Diana Miller. The taxonomy of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; species and cultivars: Classification history p. 52}} Dillenius, who referred to these seven species with apparent unique characteristics as &quot;Geranium Africanum&quot; (African Geranium){{sfn|Dillenius|1732|loc=Geranium Africanum p. 151}} suggested &quot;Possent ergo ii, quibus novi generis cupido est, ea, quorum flores inaequales vel et irrregulares sunt, Pelargonia vocare&quot; (Those who wish a new genus can therefore call those, whose flowers are unequal or irregular, ‘Pelargonia’).{{sfn|Boddy|2013|loc=Introduction p. 11}} The name was then formally introduced by Johannes Burman in 1738. However Carl Linnaeus who first formally described these plants in 1753 did not recognise &quot;Pelargonium&quot; and grouped together in the same genus (&quot;Geranium&quot;) the three similar genera &quot;Erodium&quot;, &quot;Geranium&quot;, and &quot;Pelargonium&quot;.{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753|loc=Geranium p. 676}} Linnaeus&#x27; reputation prevented further differentiation for forty years.{{sfn|Lis-Balchin|2002|loc=Diana Miller. The taxonomy of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; species and cultivars: Classification history p. 52}} The eventual distinction between them was made by Charles L’Héritier based on the number of stamens or anthers, seven in the case of &quot;Pelargonium&quot;. In 1774, &quot;P. cordatum&quot;, &quot;P. crispum&quot;, &quot;P. quercifolium&quot; and &quot;P. radula&quot; were introduced, followed by &quot;P. capitatum&quot; in 1790.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|loc=Pelargonium}}

=== Circumscription ===
&quot;Pelargonium&quot; is distinguished from the other genera in the family Geraniaceae by the presence of a hypanthium, which consists of an adnate nectar spur with one nectary, as well as a generally zygomorphic floral symmetry.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}

=== Subdivision ===
De Candolle first proposed dividing the genus into 12 sections in 1824, based on the diversity of growth forms. Traditionally the large number of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; species have been treated as sixteen sections, based on the classification of Knuth (1912) who described 15 sections, as modified by van der Walt &quot;et al&quot;. (1977–1997) who added &quot;Chorisma&quot;, &quot;Reniformia&quot; and &quot;Subsucculentia&quot;.

These are as follows;
* section &quot;Campylia&quot; (Lindley ex Sweet) de Candolle
* section &quot;Chorisma&quot; (Lindley ex Sweet) de Candolle
* section &quot;Ciconium&quot; (Sweet) Harvey
* section &quot;Cortusina&quot; (DC.) Harvey
* section &quot;Glaucophyllum&quot; Harvey
* section &quot;Hoarea&quot; (Sweet) de Candolle
* section &quot;Isopetalum&quot; (Sweet) de Candolle
* section &quot;Jenkinsonia&quot; (Sweet) de Candolle
* section &quot;Ligularia&quot; (Sweet) Harvey
* section &quot;Myrrhidium&quot; de Candolle
* section &quot;Otidia&quot; (Lindley ex Sweet) de Candolle
* section &quot;Pelargonium&quot; (Sweet) Harvey
* section &quot;Peristera&quot; de Candolle
* section &quot;Polyactium&quot; de Candolle
* section &quot;Reniformia&quot; (Knuth) Dreyer
* section &quot;Subsucculentia&quot; J.J.A. van der Walt

=== Phylogenetic analyses ===
All subdivision classifications had depended primarily on morphological differences till the era of phylogenetic analyses (Price and Palmer 1993). However phylogenetic analysis shows only three distinct clades, labelled A, B and C. In this analysis not all sections were monophyletic, although some were strongly supported including &quot;Chorisma&quot;, &quot;Myrrhidium&quot; and &quot;Jenkinsonia&quot;, while other sections were more paraphyletic. This in turn has led to a proposal, informal at this stage, of a reformulation of the infrageneric subdivision of &quot;Pelargonium&quot;.

In the proposed scheme of Weng &quot;et al&quot;. there would be two subgenera, based on clades A+B, and C respectively and seven sections based on subclades. Subsequent analysis with an expanded taxa set confirmed this infrageneric subdivision into two groups which also correspond to chromosome length (&lt;1.5 μ, 1.5-3.0μ),{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} but also two subclades within each major clade, suggesting the presence of four subgenera, these correspond to clades A, B, C1 and C2 of the earlier analysis, A being by far the largest clade with 141 taxa. As before the internal structure of the clades supported monophyly of some sections (&quot;Myrrhidium&quot;, &quot;Chorisma&quot;, &quot;Reniformia&quot;, &quot;Pelargonium&quot;, &quot;Ligularia&quot; and &quot;Hoarea&quot;) but paraphyly in others (&quot;Jenkinsonia&quot;, &quot;Ciconium&quot;, &quot;Peristera&quot;). A distinct clade could be identified within the paraphyletic &quot;Polyactium&quot;, designated section &quot;Magnistipulacea&quot;. As a result, &quot;Polyactium&quot; has been split up to provide this new section, which in itself contains two subsections, &quot;Magnistipulacea&quot; and &quot;Schizopetala&quot;, following Knuth&#x27;s original treatment of &quot;Polyactium&quot; as having four subsections.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}


Thus Röschenbleck &quot;et al.&quot; (2014) provide a complete revision of the subgeneric classification of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; based on four subgenera corresponding to their major clades (A, B, C1, C2);
* subgenus &quot;Magnipetala&quot; Type: &quot;Pelargonium praemorsum&quot; 
* subgenus &quot;Parvulipetala&quot; Type: &quot;Pelargonium hypoleucum&quot; 
* subgenus &quot;Paucisignata&quot; Type: &quot;Pelargonium zonale&quot; 
* subgenus &quot;Pelargonium&quot; Type: &quot;Pelargonium cucullatum&quot; {{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}

Sixteen sections were then assigned to the new subgenera as follows, although many species remained only assigned to subgenera at this stage

* subgenus &quot;Magnipetala&quot; 3 sections
** section &quot;Chorisma&quot; – 4 species
** section &quot;Jenkinsonia&quot; – 11 species
** section &quot;Myrrhidium&quot; – 8 species
* subgenus &quot;Parvulipetala&quot; 3 sections
** section &quot;Isopetalum&quot; – 1 species (&quot;Pelargonium cotyledonis&quot; )
** section &quot;Peristera&quot; – 30 species
** section &quot;Reniformia&quot; – 8 species
* subgenus &quot;Paucisignata&quot; 2 sections
** section &quot;Ciconium&quot; – 16 species
** section &quot;Subsucculentia&quot; – 3 species
* subgenus &quot;Pelargonium&quot; 8 sections
** section &quot;Campylia&quot; – 9 species
** section &quot;Cortusina&quot; – 7 species
** section &quot;Hoarea&quot; – 72 species
** section &quot;Ligularia&quot; – 10 species
** section &quot;Magnistipulacea&quot; Type: &quot;Pelargonium schlecteri&quot; – 2 subsections
*** subsection &quot;Magnistipulacea&quot; Type: &quot;Pelargonium schlecteri&quot; – 2 species (&quot;P. schlecteri&quot; &amp; &quot;P. luridum&quot;)
*** subsection &quot;Schizopetala&quot; Type: &quot;Pelargonium afrum&quot; – 3 species (&quot;P. afrum&quot;, &quot;P. bowkeri&quot;, &quot;P. schizopetalum&quot;)
** section &quot;Otidia&quot; – 14 species
** section &quot;Pelargonium&quot; – 34 species
** section &quot;Polyactium&quot; – 2 subsections
*** subsection &quot;Caulescentia&quot; – 1 species (&quot;Pelargonium gibbosum&quot;)
*** subsection &quot;Polyactium&quot; – 7 species

=== Subgenera ===
Subgenus &quot;Magnipetala&quot;: Corresponds to clade C1, with 24 species. Perennial to short lived, spreading subshrubs, rarely herbaceous annuals. Petals five, but may be four, colour mainly white. Mainly winter rainfall region of South Africa, spreading into summer rainfall region. One species in northern Namibia and Botswana. Two species in East Africa and Ethiopia. Chromosomes x=11 and 9.

Subgenus &quot;Parvulipetala&quot;: Corresponds to clade B, with 39-42 species. Perennials, partly annuals. Petals five and equal, colour white or pink to deep purplish red. Mainly South Africa, but also other southern hemisphere except South America. a few species in East Africa and Ethiopia. Chromosomes x=7-19.

Subgenus &quot;Paucisignata&quot;: Corresponds to clade C2, with 25-27 species. Erect sometimes trailing shrubs or subshrubs, rarely geophytes or semi-geophytes. Petals five and equal, colour pink to red sometimes white. Summer rainfall region of South Africa, spreading into winter rainfall region and northern Namibia, with a few species in tropical Africa, Ethiopia, Somalia, Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula and Asia Minor. Chromosomes x=mainly 9 or 10, but from 4–18.

Subgenus &quot;Pelargonium&quot;: Corresponds to clade A, with 167 species. Frequently xerophytic deciduous perennials with many geophytes and succulent subshrubs, less frequently woody evergreen shrubs or annual herbs. Petals five, colour shades of pink to purple or yellow. Winter rainfall region of South Africa and adjacent Namibia, spreading to summer rainfall area, and two species in tropical Africa. Chromosomes x=11, may be 8–10.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}

===Species===
{{main|List of Pelargonium species}}
&quot;Pelargonium&quot; has around 280 species.{{r|powo}} Röschenbleck &quot;et al&quot; lists 281 taxa.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} There is considerable confusion as to which &quot;Pelargonium&quot; are true species, and which are cultivars or hybrids. The nomenclature has changed considerably since the first plants were introduced to Europe in the 17th century.

=== Etymology ===

The name &quot;Pelargonium&quot; is derived from the Greek , &quot;pelargós&quot; (stork), because the seed head looks like a stork&#x27;s beak. Dillenius originally suggested the name &#x27;stork&#x27;, because &quot;Geranium&quot; was named after a crane — &quot;&quot;a&quot; πελαργός, &quot;ciconia, sicuti vocamus Gerania&quot;, γερανός, &quot;grus&quot;&quot; (from &quot;pelargos&quot;, stork, as we call the &quot;Gerania&quot;, &quot;geranos&quot;, crane).{{sfn|Dillenius|1732|loc=De Geraniorum Differentiis}}{{sfn|Boddy|2013|loc=Introduction p. 11}}

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Pelargonium&quot; is a large genus within the family Geraniaceae, which has a worldwide distribution in temperate to subtropical zones with some 800 mostly herbaceous species.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} &quot;Pelargonium&quot; itself is native to southern Africa (including Namibia) and Australia. Southern Africa contains 90% of the genus, with only about 30 species found elsewhere, predominantly the East African rift valley (about 20 species) and southern Australia, including Tasmania.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} The remaining few species are found in southern Madagascar, Yemen, Iraq, Asia Minor, the north of New Zealand and isolated islands in the south Atlantic Ocean (Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha) and Socotra in the Indian Ocean.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} The centre of diversity is in southwestern South Africa where rainfall is confined to the winter, unlike the rest of the country where rainfall is predominantly in the summer months.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} Most of the &quot;Pelargonium&quot; plants cultivated in Europe and North America have their origins in South Africa.

==Ecology==
&quot;Pelargonium&quot; species are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species, including the noctuid moth angle shades, &quot;Phlogophora meticulosa&quot;. The diurnal butterflies &quot;Cacyreus marshalli&quot; and &quot;C. tespis&quot; (Lycaenidae), native to southern Africa, also feed on &quot;Geranium&quot; and &quot;Pelargonium&quot;. &quot;C. marshallii&quot; has been introduced to Europe and can develop into a pest on cultivated Pelargoniums. It has naturalised along the Mediterranean, but does not survive the winter in Westen Europe.

The Japanese beetle, an important agricultural insect pest, becomes rapidly paralyzed after consuming flower petals of the garden hybrids known as &quot;zonal geraniums&quot; (&quot;P.&quot; × &quot;hortorum&quot;). The phenomenon was first described in 1920, and subsequently confirmed. Research conducted by Dr. Christopher Ranger with the USDA Agricultural Research Service and other collaborating scientists have demonstrated the excitatory amino acid called quisqualic acid present within the flower petals is responsible for causing paralysis of the Japanese beetle. Quisqualic acid is thought to mimic L-glutamic acid, which is a neurotransmitter in the insect neuromuscular junction and mammalian central nervous system.

A study by the Laboratory of Apiculture &amp; Social Insects group at the University of Sussex on the attractiveness of common garden plants to pollinators found that a cultivar of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; × &quot;hortorum&quot; was unattractive to pollinators in comparison to other selected garden plants such as &quot;Lavandula&quot; (lavender) and &quot;Origanum&quot;.

===Pests and diseases===
{{Main|List of geranium diseases|Pelargonium flower break virus|Pelargonium line pattern virus}}

The geranium bronze butterfly is a pest of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; species. The larvae of the geranium bronze bore into the stem of the host plant, causing the stem to typically turn black and die soon after. Geranium bronze are currently listed as an A2 quarantine pest by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization and can cause significant damage to &quot;Pelargonium&quot; species.

==Cultivation==

Various types of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; are regular participants in flower shows and competitive events, with numerous societies devoted exclusively to their cultivation. They are easy to propagate vegetatively from cuttings. It is recommended that cuttings should have at least two nodes. Zonal geraniums grow in U.S. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 9 through 12. Zonal geraniums are basically tropical perennials. Although they are often grown as annuals, they may overwinter in zones as cool as zone 7.

===Cultivation history===
The first species of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; known to be cultivated was &quot;P. triste&quot;, a native of South Africa. It was probably brought to the Botanical Garden in Leiden before 1600 on ships which had stopped at the Cape of Good Hope. In 1631, the English gardener John Tradescant the elder bought seeds from Rene Morin in Paris and introduced the plant to England. By 1724, &quot;P. inquinans&quot;, &quot;P. odoratissimum&quot;, &quot;P. peltatum&quot;, &quot;P. vitifolium&quot;, and &quot;P. zonale&quot; had been introduced to Europe.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|loc=Pelargonium}}

=== Cultivars ===

There was little attempt at any rational grouping of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; cultivars, the growing of which was revived in the mid-twentieth century, and the origins of many if not most were lost in obscurity. In 1916 the American botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey (1858–1954) introduced two new terms for zonal and regal pelargoniums. Those pelargoniums which were largely derived from &quot;P. zonale&quot; he referred to as &quot;P.&quot; × &quot;hortorum&quot; (i.e. from the garden), while those from &quot;P. cucullatum&quot; he named &quot;P.&quot; × &quot;domesticum&quot; (i.e. from the home).{{sfn|Wilkinson|2007|loc=p. 189}} In the late 1950s a list (the Spalding List) was produced in the United States, based on nursery listings and the 1897 list of Henri Dauthenay.{{sfn|Dauthenay|1897}} It described seven groups, listing each cultivar with the list of its originator, and in most cases a date. These were Species, Zonals, Variegated-Leaved, Domesticum (Regals), Ivy-Leaved, Scented-Leaved and Old. In the 1970s the British Pelargonium and Geranium Society produced a checklist and the Australian Geranium Society started to produce a register but it was not completed till its author, Jean Llewellyn&#x27;s death in 1999. None of these were published. The most complete list in its time was the 2001 compilation by The Geraniaceae Group,{{sfn|Amadio|2015}} which included all cultivars up to 1959.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2007|loc=Appendix 2: Horticultural Classification and Glossary}}

Registration of cultivars is the responsibility of the Pelargonium &amp; Geranium Society (PAGS: formed in 2009 from the British Pelargonium and Geranium Society and the British and European Geranium Society){{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=About us}} which administers the International Register of Pelargonium Cultivars.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=International Register of Pelargonium Cultivars}} PAGS is the International Cultivar Registration Authority (ICRA) of the International Society for Horticultural Science for pelargoniums.{{sfn|ISHS|2015|loc=ICRA: Pelargonium and Geranium Society}}

Cultivated pelargoniums are commonly divided into six groups{{sfn|RHS|2015|loc=&quot;Pelargonium&quot; (geranium)}} in addition to species pelargoniums and primary hybrids. The following list is ordered by position in the PAGS classification.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Pelargonium Basics}} Abbreviations indicate Royal Horticultural Society usage.{{sfn|RHS|2015|loc=Horticultural classification for &quot;Pelargonium&quot; L&#x27;Her. ex Aiton}}

* A. Zonal (Z)
* B. Ivy-leaved (I)
* C. Regal (R)
* D. Angel (A)
* E. Unique (U)
* F. Scented-leaved (Sc)
* G. Species
* H. Primary hybrids

Of these, A, U and Sc groups are sometimes lumped together as Species Derived (Sppd). This term implies that they are closely related to a species from which they were derived, and do not fit into the R, I or Z groups.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}

In addition to the primary groups, additional descriptors are used. The Royal Horticultural Society has created description codes. These include;{{sfn|RHS|2015|loc=Horticultural classification for &quot;Pelargonium&quot; L&#x27;Her. ex Aiton}}

* Cactus (Ca)
* Coloured foliage (C)
* Decorative (Dec)
* Double (d)
* Dwarf (Dw)
* Dwarf Ivy-leaved (Dwl)
* Frutetorum (Fr)
* Miniature (Min)
* Miniature Ivy-leaved (MinI)
* Stellar (St)
* Tulip (T)
* Variegated (v)

These may then be combined to form the code, &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;Pelargonium&quot; &#x27;Chelsea Gem&#x27; (Z/d/v), indicating Zonal Double with variegated foliage. Crosses between groups are indicated with an ×, &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;Pelargonium&quot; &#x27;Hindoo&#x27; (R × U), indicating a Regal × Unique cross.

==== A. Zonal pelargoniums (&quot;Pelargonium&quot; × &quot;hortorum&quot; ) ====

These are known as zonal geraniums because many have zones or patterns in the center of the leaves, this is the contribution of the &quot;Pelargonium zonale&quot; parent. Common names include storksbill, fish or horseshoe geraniums.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}} They are also referred to as &quot;Pelargonium&quot; × &quot;hortorum&quot; . Zonal pelargoniums are tetraploid, mostly derived from &quot;P. inquinans&quot; and &quot;P. zonale&quot;, together with &quot;P. scandens&quot; and &quot;P. frutetorum&quot;.{{sfn|RHS|2015|loc=&quot;Pelargonium&quot; (geranium)}}

Zonal pelargoniums are mostly bush-type plants with succulent stems grown for the beauty of their flowers, traditionally red, salmon, violet, white or pink. The scarlet colouring is attributed to the contribution of &quot;P. inquinans&quot;.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|loc=Pelargonium}} Flowers may be double or single. They are the pelargoniums most often confused with genus &quot;Geranium&quot;, particularly in summer bedding arrangements. This incorrect nomenclature is widely used in horticulture, particularly in North America.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|loc=Pelargonium}}

Zonals include a variety of plant types along with genetic hybrids such as hybrid ivy-leaved varieties that display little or no ivy leaf characteristics (the Deacons varieties), or the Stellar varieties. Hybrid zonals are crosses between zonals and either a species or species-derived pelargonium.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}} There are hundreds of zonal cultivars available for sale, and like other cultivars are sold in series such as &#x27;Rocky Mountain&#x27;, each of which is named after its predominant colour, &quot;e.g.&quot; &#x27;Rocky Mountain Orange&#x27;, &#x27;White&#x27;, &#x27;Dark Red&#x27;, &quot;etc&quot;.
*(i) Basic plants – Mature plants with foliage normally exceeding {{convert|180|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height above the rim of the pot. For exhibition these should be grown in a pot exceeding {{convert|120|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in diameter but not normally exceeding {{convert|165|mm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}}.
*(ii) Dwarf plants – Smaller than basic. Mature plants with foliage more than {{convert|125|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the rim of the pot, but not normally more than {{convert|180|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}. For exhibition should be grown in a pot exceeding {{convert|90|mm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} but not exceeding {{convert|120|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}. They should not exceed 200 mm in height, grown in an 11 cm pot.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}
*(iii) Miniature plants – Slowly growing pelargoniums. Mature plants with foliage normally less than {{convert|125|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the rim of the pot. For exhibition should be grown in a pot not exceeding {{convert|90|mm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}}. They should not exceed 125 mm in height, grown in a 9 cm pot.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}
*(iv) Micro-miniature plants – Smaller and more slowly growing than miniature pelargoniums. Mature plants with foliage normally less than {{convert|100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the rim of the pot. They should not exceed 75 mm in height, grown in a 6 cm pot.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}} Usually no separate classes for these in exhibition and will therefore normally be shown as Miniature Zonals.
*(v) Deacon varieties –Genetic hybrid similar to a large Dwarf. For exhibition (when shown in a separate class), usually grown in a pot not exceeding {{convert|125|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, otherwise as for Dwarf Zonals.
*(vi) Stellar varieties – A relatively modern genetic hybrid originating from the work done by the Australian hybridiser Ted Both in the late 1950s and 1960s from crosses between Australian species and Zonal types. Easily identifiable by their distinctive half-star-shaped leaves and slim-petalled blooms which create an impression of being star shaped (or five fingered). Single varieties tend to have larger elongated triangular petals whereas doubles tend to have thin feathered petals that are tightly packed together. For exhibition purposes there is a separate class for &#x27;Stellar&#x27; varieties, but being Zonals could be shown in an open class for Basic, Dwarf or Miniature Zonals (unless otherwise stated). Also known as &quot;The Five-fingered Geraniums&quot;, &quot;Staphysagroides&quot;, &quot;Both’s Staphs&quot;, &quot;Both’s Hybrid Staphs&quot;, &quot;Fingered Flowers&quot; and &quot;Bodey’s Formosum Hybrids&quot;.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}

Fancy-leaf zonal pelargoniums – besides having green leaves with or without zoning, this group also have variable coloured foliage{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}} that is sometimes used in classifying for exhibition purposes, &quot;e.g.&quot; ‘Bicolour’, ‘Tricolour’, ‘Bronze’ or ‘Gold’. Other foliage types are: ‘Black’ or ‘Butterfly’. There are an increasing number of these plants with showy blooms;

*(a) Bicolour – includes those with white or cream veined leaves or those with two distinct colours with clearly defined edges, other than the basic zone.
*(b) Tricolour – (May be Silver Tricolour (usually called a Silver Leaf) or a Gold Tricolour).
**(i) Gold Tricolour – Leaves of many colours including red and gold, but usually with clearly defined edges of golden yellow and having a leaf zone, usually red or bronze, that overlays two or more of the other distinct leaf colours, so that the zone itself appears as two or more distinct colours.
**(ii) Silver Tricolour or Silver Leaf – These tend to resemble a normal bi-colour leaf plant with two distinct colours usually of green and pale cream or white; the third colour is usually made up of bronze zoning. When this zoning overlays the green part of the leaf it is deemed to represent a silver colour. 
*(c) Bronze Leaved – Leaves of Green or Golden/Green with a heavy bronze or chestnut coloured centre zone which is known as a medallion. For exhibition purposes, when exhibited in specific ‘Bronze’ Leaf class – Must have over 50% of leaf surface bronze coloured. The dwarf plant ‘Overchurch’ which has a heavy bronze medallion. 
*(d) Gold Leaved – Leaves coloured golden/yellow or green/yellow but not showing a tendency to green. For exhibition purposes, when exhibited in specific ‘Gold’ Leaf class – Must have over 50% of leaf surface gold coloured.
*(e) Black Leaved – Leaves coloured black, purple-black or with distinct large dark zones or centre markings on green.
*(f) Butterfly Leaved – Leaves with a butterfly marking of distinct tone or hue in centre of leaf. This can be encompassed in many of the coloured leaf varieties.

Zonal pelargoniums have many flower types, as follows:{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}

*(a) Single flowered (S) – each flower pip normally having no more than five petals. This is the standard flower set for all Pelargoniums.
*(b) Semi-double flowered (SD) – each flower pip normally having between six and nine petals. 
*(c) Double flowered (D)– each flower pip composed of more than nine petals (i.e. double the standard flower set) but not ‘hearted’ like the bud of a rose, &quot;e.g.&quot; the dwarf ‘Dovepoint’ which has full double blooms. 
*(d) Rosebud (or noisette) flowered – each bloom fully double and ‘hearted’. The middle petals are so numerous that they remain unopened like the bud of a rose.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}} 
*(e) Tulip flowered – having semi-double blooms that never fully open. The large cup shaped petals open just sufficiently to resemble a miniature tulip.
*(f) Bird&#x27;s-egg group – having blooms with petals that have spots in a darker shade than the base colour, like many birds eggs.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}
*(g) Speckled flowered group – having petals that are marked with splashes and flecks of another colour, &quot;e.g.&quot; ‘Vectis Embers’.
*(h) Quilled (or cactus-flowered group, or poinsettia in USA) – having petals twisted and furled like a quill.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}

“Zonquil” pelargoniums result from a cross between Zonal pelargonium cultivars and &quot;P. quinquelobatum&quot;.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}

==== B. Ivy-leaved pelargoniums (derived from &quot;Pelargonium peltatum&quot;) ====

Also known as &quot;ivy geraniums&quot;.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}Usually of lax growth (trailing), mainly due to the long thin stems, with thick, waxy ivy-shaped stiff fleshy evergreen leaves developed by the species &quot;P. peltatum&quot; to retain moisture during periods of drought. Much used for hanging pots, tubs and basket cultivation. In the UK the bulbous double-headed types are preferred whilst on the European continent the balcon single types for large-scale hanging floral displays are favoured. Ivy-leaved pelargoniums embrace all such growth size types including small-leaved varieties and genetic hybrid crosses, which display little or no zonal characteristics. May have bicolour leaves and may have flowers that are single, double or rosette. Ivy pelargoniums are often sold as series such as &#x27;Great Balls of Fire&#x27;, in a variety of colours such as &#x27;Great Balls of Fire Burgundy&#x27;.

Additional descriptive terms include;{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}

* Hybrid Ivy — the result of ivy × zonal crosses, but still more closely resemble ivy-leaved pelargoniums.
* Fancy leaf — leaves with marked color variation, together with or other than green.
* Miniature — miniature leaves and flowers, stems with short nodes, and compact growth. &quot;e.g.&quot; &#x27;Sugar Baby&#x27; listed as Dwarf Ivy (DwI) by RHS.{{sfn|RHS|2015|loc=Horticultural classification for &quot;Pelargonium&quot; L&#x27;Her. ex Aiton}}

==== C. Regal pelargoniums (&quot;Pelargonium&quot; × &quot;domesticum&quot; ) ====

These are large bush-type floriferous evergreen pelargoniums. In addition to &quot;Regals&quot; they are also known as “Show Pelargoniums”. In the United States they are often known as the &quot;Martha Washington&quot; or ‘&quot;Lady Washington&quot; pelargoniums. They are grown primarily for the beauty and richness of their flower heads, which are large. Most of those cultivars grown currently are the result of hybridization over the last 50 years. They are very short-jointed and compact, which results in their requiring very little work in order to create a floriforous and well-rounded plant.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Pelargonium Basics}} Flowers are single, rarely double, in mauve, pink, purple or white. They have rounded, sometimes lobed or partially toothed (serrated) leaves, unlike the Zonal groups, without any type of zoning.

Additional descriptive terms include;{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}

* Fancy leaf – Leaves with marked variations in colour 
* Decorative pelargoniums (Decoratives) – Descendants of older, less compact, smaller-flowered varieties that are more suited to outdoor conditions. These have smaller flowers than Regal, but are otherwise similar. &quot;e.g.&quot; ‘Royal Ascot’
* Miniature – Flowers and leaves similar to Regal, but miniature in form, with compact growth. Other terms include “Pansy Geraniums” or “Pansy Pelargoniums”. &quot;e.g.&quot; ‘Lara Susan’
* Oriental pelargoniums – The result of crosses between Regals and members of the Angel group (see below). Some have bicolour foliage.

==== D. Angel pelargoniums (derived from &quot;Pelargonium crispum&quot;) ====

Angel pelargoniums are similar to Regal pelargoniums but more closely resemble &quot;P. crispum&quot; in leaf shape and growth habit. The majority of Angel cultivars originate from a cross between &quot;P. crispum&quot; and a Regal variety in the early part of the 20th century. Angels have grown in popularity in the last 30 years or so due mainly to an explosion of new varieties being released by specialist nurseries resulting from the work done by dedicated amateur hybridisers. These hybrisers have managed to obtain many new flower colour breaks and tighter growth habits resulting in plants suitable for all sorts of situations. Angels basically have the appearance of a small Regal with small serrated leaves and much smaller flowers and are more compact and bushy. The group extends to include similar small-leaved and -flowered types but usually with &quot;P. crispum&quot; in their parentage. They are mostly upright bush-type plants but there are some lax varieties that can be used for basket or hanging pot cultivation. Often called &quot;pansy-faced&quot; in the US. Some varieties have bicolour foliage. Other terms include ‘Langley-Smith Hybrids’.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}

==== E. Unique pelargoniums (derived from &quot;Pelargonium fulgidum&quot;) ====

Unique in sense of not fitting into any of the above categories. The parentage of Unique pelargoniums is confused and obscure. One theory being a derivation from &quot;P. fulgidum&quot;, but a derivation from an older cultivar &#x27;Old Unique’, also known as or ‘Rollinson’s Crimson’, in the mid-19th century is also claimed.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}} Unique pelargoniums resemble upright Scented Leaf pelargoniums in being shrubby and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have bicolour foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with Regal pelargoniums and, as a result of this cross, are much more floriferous.

; Cultivar:
* Fiery-flowered Stork&#x27;s-bill, Scarlet Unique Scented Geranium (&quot;P.&quot; × &quot;ignescens&quot;){{sfn|Sweet|1822|loc=&quot;Pelargonium ignescens&quot;}} - a &quot;P. fulgidum&quot; hybrid

==== F. Scented-leaved pelargoniums ====

Shrubby evergreen perennials grown chiefly for their fragrance, may be species or cultivars but all must have a clear and distinct scented foliage. Scent is emitted when the leaves are touched or bruised with some scents aromatic, others pungent and in a few cases, quite unpleasant. Several of the scented leaved pelargoniums are grown for the oil geraniol, which is extracted from the leaves and is an essential oil much used commercially in perfumery. The scent of some species growing in their natural habitat, acts as a deterrent to grazing animals who appear to dislike the emitted scent. Conversely, it also attracts other insect life to visit the bloom and pollinate the plant. The scented leaves can be used for potpourri and they also have a use as flavourings in cooking. Occasionally scented types can be found in some of the other groups mentioned; for example, the Angels, having &quot;P. crispum&quot; in their genetic makeup, can often have a strong citrus scent. Leaves are lobed, toothed, incised or variegated. Growth habit is very variable, but the flowers are less prominent than other groups, and most closely resemble the species they originated from.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=Horticultural symbols and terms}}

==== G. Species pelargoniums ====
The species are the forefathers of all the cultivar groups listed above. In general, the definition of a species is that it breeds true, and is to be found doing this in the &quot;wild&quot;. Species pelargoniums have a large diversity of characteristics in habit, shape, size and colour, which probably accounts for them having retained their popularity for more than 300 years.

==== H. Primary hybrids ====
A primary hybrid is recognised as being the resultant plant from a first-time cross between two different known species. Examples are &quot;P.&quot; × &quot;ardens&quot; – from &quot;P. lobatum&quot; × &quot;P. fulgidum&quot; (1810). &quot;P.&quot; × &quot;glauciifolium&quot; – from &quot;P. gibbosum&quot; × &quot;P. lobatum&quot; (1822). Usually, but not always, primary hybrids are sterile.

==Uses==

=== Ornamental plants ===
Pelargoniums rank as one of the highest number of potted flowering plants sold and also in terms of wholesale value.

=== Scented leaf pelargoniums ===
Other than being grown for their beauty, species such as &quot;P. graveolens&quot; are important in the perfume industry and are cultivated and distilled for their scents. Although scented pelargoniums exist which have smells of citrus, mint, pine, spices or various fruits, the varieties with rose scents are most commercially important.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Pelargonium distillates and absolutes, commonly known as &quot;scented geranium oil&quot; are sometimes used to supplement or adulterate expensive rose oils. The oils of the scented pelargoniums contain citronellol, geraniol, eugenol, alpha-pinene and many other compounds. The edible leaves and flowers are also used as a flavouring in desserts, cakes, jellies and teas. Scented-leafed pelargoniums can be used to flavor jellies, cakes, butters, ice cream, iced tea and other dishes, The rose-, lemon- and peppermint-scents are most commonly used. Also used are those with hints of peach, cinnamon and orange. Commonly used lemon-scented culinary species include &quot;P. crispum and P. citronellum&quot;. Rose-scenteds include &quot;P. graveolens&quot; and members of the &quot;P. graveolens&quot; cultivar group. Other species and cultivars with culinary use include the lime-scented &quot;P.&quot; ‘Lime’, the lemon balm-scented &quot;P.&quot; ‘Lemon Balm’, the strawberry-lemon-scented &quot;P.&quot; ‘Lady Scarborough’ and the peppermint-scented &quot;P. tomentosum&quot;. Scented leaf pelargoniums have also been historically used as toilet paper by fishermen in remote places, such as the Minquiers.

===Herbal medicine===
In herbal medicine, &quot;Pelargonium&quot; has been used for intestinal problems, wounds and respiratory ailments, but &quot;Pelargonium&quot; species have also been used for fevers, kidney complaints and other conditions. Geranium (Pelargonium) oil is considered a relaxant in aromatherapy, and in recent years, respiratory/cold remedies made from &quot;P. sidoides&quot; and &quot;P. reniforme&quot; have been sold in Europe and the United States. &quot;P. sidoides&quot; along with Echinacea is used for bronchitis. &quot;P. odoratissimum&quot; is used for its astringent, tonic and antiseptic effects. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} It is used internally for debility, gastroenteritis, and hemorrhage and externally for skin complaints, injuries, and neuralgia and throat infections. The essential oil is used in aromatherapy.

==== Pets ====

According to the ASPCA, these plants are toxic to cats, dogs, and horses.

=== Chemistry ===
Pelargonin (pelargonidin 3,5-O-diglucoside) is a petal pigment of the scarlet pelargonium.

== In culture ==
Chemist John Dalton realized that he was color blind in 1794 when he heard others describe the color of the flowers of the pink &quot;Pelargonium zonale&quot; as pink or red, when to him it looked either pink or blue, having no relationship to red at all.

<text>Wheaton College is a private Evangelical Christian liberal arts college in Wheaton, Illinois, United States. It was founded by evangelical abolitionists in 1860. Wheaton College was a stop on the Underground Railroad and graduated one of Illinois&#x27; first black college graduates.

==History==
Wheaton College was founded in 1860. Its predecessor, the Illinois Institute, had been founded in late 1853 by Wesleyan Methodists as a college and preparatory school. Wheaton&#x27;s first president, Jonathan Blanchard, was a former president of Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, and a staunch abolitionist with ties to Oberlin College. Mired in financial trouble and unable to sustain the institution, the Wesleyans looked to Blanchard for new leadership. He took on the role as president in 1860, having suggested several Congregationalist appointees to the board of trustees the previous year. The Wesleyans, similar in spirit and mission to the Congregationalists, were happy to relinquish control of the Illinois Institute. Blanchard officially separated the college from any denominational support and was responsible for its new name, given in honor of trustee and benefactor Warren L. Wheaton, who founded the town of Wheaton after moving to Illinois from New England.

A dogged reformer, Blanchard began his public campaign for abolitionism with the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1836, at the age of twenty-five. Later in his life, after the Civil War, he began a sustained campaign against Freemasonry. This culminated in a national presidential campaign on the American Anti-Masonic Party ticket in 1884.
Under Blanchard&#x27;s leadership, the college was a stop on the Underground Railroad. The confirmation came from the letters of Ezra Cook, one of Blanchard&#x27;s relatives by marriage, who notes that the town and college&#x27;s anti-slavery beliefs were so widely held that he, along with hundreds of other Wheaton residents, had seen and spoken with many fugitive slaves.

Blanchard consistently lobbied for universal co-education and was a strong proponent of reform through strong public education open to all. At this time, Wheaton was the only school in Illinois with a college-level women&#x27;s program. Also, Wheaton saw its first graduate of color in 1866, when Edward Breathitte Sellers took his degree. Additionally, he is one of the first African-American college graduates in Illinois.
In 1882, Charles A. Blanchard succeeded his father as president of the college.

In 1925, J. Oliver Buswell, an outspoken Presbyterian, delivered a series of lectures at Wheaton College. Shortly after that, President Charles Blanchard died, and Buswell was called to be the third president of Wheaton. Upon his installation in April 1926, he became the nation&#x27;s youngest college president at age 31. Buswell&#x27;s tenure was characterized by expanding enrollment (from approximately 400 in 1925 to 1,100 in 1940), a building program, strong academic development, and a boom in the institution&#x27;s reputation. It was also known for growing divisiveness over faculty scholarship and personality clashes. In 1940, this tension led to the firing of Buswell for being, as two college historians put it, &quot;too argumentative in temperament and too intellectual in his approach to Christianity.&quot; By the late 1940s, Wheaton was emerging as a standard-bearer of Evangelicalism.

By 1950, enrollment at the college had surpassed 1,600. In the second half of the twentieth century, enrollment growth and more selective admissions accompanied athletic success, additional and improved facilities, and expanded programs.

In 1951, Honey Rock, a camp in Three Lakes, Wisconsin, was purchased by the college.

The school changed its nickname from the &quot;Crusaders&quot; to the &quot;Thunder&quot; in 2000. The national press noted the change, and some alumni objected. Wheaton rejected other suggestions for a new mascot name, including the &quot;Mastodons&quot; — a reference to Perry Mastodon, which is a mastodon skeleton that was excavated nearby and is now on display on the college campus in the science building. While still known by the nickname &quot;Thunder&quot;, in 2011, the college officially changed its mascot to a mastodon named &quot;Tor Thunder&quot; to integrate the nickname and mascot.

In 2010, the public phase of &quot;The Promise of Wheaton&quot; campaign came to a close with $250.7 million (~$ in ) raised, an &quot;unprecedented 5-1/2 year campaign figure for Wheaton College&quot;.

In 2010, Wheaton College became the first American Associate University of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation&#x27;s Faith and Globalization Initiative. Tony Blair noted that the partnership will &quot;give emerging leaders in the United States and the United Kingdom the opportunity to explore in depth the critical issues of how faith impacts the modern world today through different faith and cultural lenses&quot; and that Wheaton&#x27;s participation will &quot;greatly enrich the Initiative&quot;.

, the college continued to retain its Christian &quot;Statement of Faith and Educational Purpose&quot; and expected its staff and faculty members to adhere to it.

==Campus==
Wheaton&#x27;s most recognizable and oldest building is Blanchard Hall, a limestone building built as the main College building in 1853. At the time, the College building was one of only two on campus, the other (called the &quot;boarding hall&quot;) being a frame building at the foot of the hill crowned by the two-story building. Jonathan Blanchard had a vision for the expansion of this structure into its present castle-like architecture. Wheaton contends that it patterns its campus architecture after buildings at the University of Oxford which Blanchard admired on a trip to England in 1843. After four additions (1871, 1873, 1890, 1927), Wheaton completed the Main Building in 1927. That year, under college president J. Oliver Buswell, Jr., Wheaton renamed the Main Building Blanchard Hall to honor Wheaton&#x27;s first two presidents, Jonathan Blanchard and his son Charles Blanchard.

Blanchard Hall served as a stop on the Underground Railroad.

===Academic===
In 1900, Wheaton built the brick &quot;Industrial Building&quot;. From 1917 to 1945 it housed the Wheaton Academy, and from 1945 to 1960 the Graduate School. In 1960 it was renamed Buswell Hall, and in 1980 renamed Schell Hall in honor of Edward R. Schell.

Wheaton housed its science departments in Breyer (Chemistry) and Armerding (Biology, Geology, Math, and Physics) halls until the 2010–11 school year when Wheaton completed a new Meyer Science Center. Armerding Hall was also the home to the Wheaton College Observatory (a feature of the college since the presidency of Charles Blanchard in the late nineteenth century), which Wheaton relocated to the Meyer Science Center.

The Wheaton College Conservatory of Music, housed in the Armerding Center for Music and Arts (previously in McAlister Hall and Pierce Memorial Chapel), is an internationally recognized music school and is the only conservatory within an Evangelical school of higher education. The approximately 200 students within the conservatory focus on various fields of music, including education, performance, composition, and history. Student recitals, required for graduation with a music degree, are held in the Armerding recital hall.

==Academics==

Wheaton College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

According to &quot;The Princeton Review&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The Best 351 Colleges&quot;, &quot;If the integration of faith and learning is what you want out of a college, Wheaton is arguably the best school in the nation with a Christ-based worldview.&quot; Students may choose from about 40 majors in many liberal arts disciplines and the sciences. The most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Business/Managerial Economics (64)
*Psychology (46)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (33)
*English Language and Literature (30)
*Elementary Education and Teaching (28)
*Health Services/Allied Health/Health Sciences (28)
*International Relations and Affairs (28)

In 2025, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Wheaton College at 53 out of 265 Best National Liberal Arts Colleges. Wheaton continued to achieve high rankings in several areas of the report:
* No. 36 in freshmen retention (2025 Report)
* No. 38 in top performers on social mobility (2025 Report)

Wheaton College ranked ninth in the nation in the total number of graduates (all fields) who went on to earn doctorates (from 1986 to 1995) according to Franklin &amp; Marshall College&#x27;s 2004 survey, which included more than 900 private colleges and universities.

Wheaton&#x27;s acceptance of evolutionary biology in the science departments has been controversial to religious creationists. Wheaton College was prominently featured in the 2001 PBS documentary &quot;&quot;, which showcased Wheaton professors&#x27; acceptance of theistic evolution.

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Wheaton College 75th in their annual list of 650 best undergraduate institutions and gave Wheaton a financial grade of &quot;A&quot;. &quot;Forbes&quot; also lists Wheaton among the Top 100 ROI Colleges in 2014.

Throughout 2010-2020, Wheaton College ranked 18th in the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics&#x27; survey of baccalaureate-origin institutions of non-Science-and-Engineering doctorate recipients. This ranking uses an institutional yield weighted by an institution&#x27;s number of graduates.

===Conservatory of Music===

Wheaton College is home to a Conservatory of Music accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music. The conservatory offers two professional music degrees: the Bachelor of Music (with emphases in performance, Suzuki pedagogy, composition, history, and literature, conducting, collaborative piano, or elective studies) and the Bachelor of Music Education. All of the teaching faculty in the conservatory hold doctorates. There are approximately 200 music majors in the conservatory, with a student-faculty ratio of 7:1. Music majors and liberal arts majors alike perform in the conservatory&#x27;s six large ensembles: concert choir, jazz ensemble, men&#x27;s glee club, symphonic band, symphony orchestra, and women&#x27;s chorale. Graduates include conductor John Nelson, Grammy Award-winning American soprano Sylvia McNair, and Wendy White of the Metropolitan Opera.

===Artist Series===
The Artist Series at Wheaton College, operating under the umbrella of the Conservatory of Music, is a subscription concert series that brings world-class performers to the Wheaton College community. Previous Artist Series performers include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Lorin Maazel and the Symphonica Toscanini, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the Canadian Brass, and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards &amp; Band of the Coldstream Guard. The Artist Series frequently partners with Wheaton College Conservatory graduates, including the soprano Sylvia McNair and the conductor John Nelson.

===Graduate school===
The Wheaton College Graduate School was founded in 1937 to provide further theological training and ministry skills. The college and graduate school are on an 80-acre campus in Wheaton, Illinois, a 45-minute train ride west of downtown Chicago. There are approximately 550 graduate students enrolled, with a 14:1 student/faculty ratio.

The graduate school comprises six academic departments; Biblical and Theological Studies, Christian Formation &amp; Ministry, Evangelism and Leadership, Intercultural Studies, Psychology, and Teaching. The Graduate School offers 14 Master of Arts programs and two doctoral programs, a Ph.D. in Biblical &amp; Theological Studies and a Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology. The American Psychological Association and Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation accredit graduate school programs.

Five of the master&#x27;s programs provide a flexible degree option. Wheaton offers a Biblical Studies program as a part-time, evening cohort model. The school offers Missional Church Movements and TESOL and Intercultural Studies in a summer-only format. The college also offers an Evangelism &amp; Leadership the Christian Formation and Ministry – Outdoor and Adventure Ministry concentration in a year-round modular format.

===Library and collections===
The library, named after college trustee Robert E. Nicholas, opened in January 1952. In 1975 Buswell Memorial Library, named for the college&#x27;s third president J. Oliver Buswell, Jr., was built adjacent to the Nicholas Library, and an interior corridor linked the two, creating the college&#x27;s main library. The building also contains the Peter Stam Music Library, located downstairs and named in honor of the Conservatory of Music&#x27;s first head, Peter Stam. Buswell Memorial Library&#x27;s physical collections contain over one million items, making Buswell the largest library collection of liberal arts colleges in Illinois.
In September 2001, the Marion E. Wade Center, formerly housed in Buswell Library, moved to its new purpose-built home. Established in 1965 by professor of English Clyde S. Kilby, the Wade Center is an extensive research library and museum of the books and papers of seven British writers: C. S. Lewis, G. K. Chesterton, J. R. R. Tolkien, Owen Barfield, Dorothy L. Sayers, George MacDonald, and Charles Williams. The Wade Center has memorabilia of the Inklings, including C. S. Lewis&#x27;s writing desk and a wardrobe from his childhood home constructed by his grandfather, widely thought to have inspired the Chronicles of Narnia series (although Westmont College also owns a wardrobe that once belonged to Lewis), Charles Williams&#x27;s bookcases, J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s writing desk where he wrote the entirety of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and worked on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and Pauline Baynes&#x27;s original map of Narnia.

Buswell Library&#x27;s special collections also include the archived correspondence, manuscripts, articles, photos, and other papers of Madeleine L&#x27;Engle, the Newbery Medal-winning author of &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;. With items dating as early as 1919, the collection is composed largely of material sent to the college by L&#x27;Engle, supplemented with books and other supporting materials. The collection is the most comprehensive research center for L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s work.

===Off-campus study===
Wheaton gives students several off-campus study opportunities.

The college sponsors study-abroad programs in Asia, England, France, Germany, Israel, Latin America, and Spain, as well as a summer program in Washington, D.C. Participants in Wheaton-in-England, one of the most popular annual programs, take 2–3 courses in literature while studying in London and St. Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Many students also participate in the Human Needs and Global Resources program. The HNGR program matches select students with six-month internships in the Third World, including opportunities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Wheaton also sponsors a semester-long, experiential, residential program called Wheaton in Chicago. In Chicago, students complete internships and take advanced interdisciplinary coursework. Founded in 1998, it has enrolled students from more than 20 majors.

In 1935, Wheaton established the Wheaton College Science Station in the Black Hills of South Dakota for field instruction in the natural sciences.

In 1951, HoneyRock, the outdoor center for leadership development at Wheaton College, was established in Three Lakes, Wisconsin. HoneyRock is not only a year-round camp for young people, but it offers a variety of leadership schools and courses for students. Nearly 3,000 people utilize HoneyRock each year.

Due to Wheaton&#x27;s membership in the Council for Christian Colleges &amp; Universities, Wheaton students may also study at the Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, the Los Angeles Film Studies Center, Excelsia College in Australia, and Xi&#x27;an Foreign Language University in China. The CCCU also sponsors programs in American studies, Latin American studies, Middle Eastern studies, Russian studies, and journalism.

==Student life==

Wheaton dedicated the Memorial Student Center (MSC) on June 11, 1951. The college built the center in memory of over 1,600 former students and graduates who served in World War II and in honor of those 39 who gave their lives. The center housed the Student Union Café, nicknamed &quot;the Stupe&quot; (which has since moved to the Beamer Center). An early pamphlet described the new building and listed some rules for its use, such as No Rook Playing and No Playing of Boogie-Woogie, Jazz, or Otherwise Abusing the Piano. The MSC was remodeled during the Fall semester of 2007 for academic use and is now home to the Business Economics department, the Political Science and International Relations department, and the Wheaton College Center for Faith, Politics, and Economics.

Wheaton remodeled the MSC according to the U.S. Green Building Council&#x27;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The MSC was the first building renovated according to these standards and exceeded existing EPA standards. Many of the materials used were post-consumer, and over 20% of the materials were manufactured within a radius of the College. The MSC remodeling is part of the current capital campaign, The Promise of Wheaton.

The Dining Hall (now the &quot;Student Services Building&quot;) opened on January 4, 1953. Today it houses Student Development, Undergraduate Admissions, and the College Bookstore.

Jenks Hall is home to the Arena Theater, which was established in the Fall of 1974 and has staged over 100 full-length productions.
In the fall of 2004, the Todd M. Beamer Student Center opened. Beamer, a Wheaton alumnus, was part of a small group of passengers who stormed hijackers on United Flight 93, bringing down the plane in rural Pennsylvania during the September 11, 2001, attacks, and preventing it from reaching its target. The building that bears his name was a $20+ million project commissioned to meet the needs of the growing college community. Along with its spacious and sleek modern design, the Beamer Center features a convenience store known as the &quot;C-Store&quot;, the &quot;Stupe&quot; (the name derives from students shortening the previous nickname for the campus Student Union, &quot;Stupid Onion&quot;, which in turn is a jocular mispronunciation of Student Union), a bakery café named &quot;Sam&#x27;s&quot; (named after the former vice president of student development, Sam Shellhammer, who retired following the 2007–08 school year after serving Wheaton&#x27;s campus community for thirty years), several reading rooms and lounges, a recreation/game room, a prayer chapel, an expanded college post office, the offices for several organizations and departments, and several other event rooms. In the fall of 2006, intense rain storms created a flood that destroyed the lower level of the Beamer Center. Wheaton College has since restored the flood-damaged building.

The official student newspaper at Wheaton College is the &quot;Wheaton Record&quot;, a weekly publication with a circulation of 3400, in existence since 1876. &quot;The Record&quot; is produced by students, published by the college, and distributed each Friday after chapel free of charge. &quot;The Record&quot; was the recipient of the 2006 John David Reed General Excellence Award and has received 13 other awards from the Illinois College Press Association, of which it is a member. &quot;The Record&quot; is also a member of the Associated Collegiate Press.

In addition, Wheaton College has many organizations on campus that range from helping the poor and needy in Chicago to the arts and improvisation.

Juniors and seniors are also eligible to live in one of thirteen campus houses, apartments (five complexes), or off-campus.

===Spirituality===

The chapel, on the corner of Washington and Franklin streets, was dedicated on November 15, 1925. The college also used the building for commencements and other assemblies. In 1936–37, Wheaton renamed it the Orlinda Childs Pierce Memorial Chapel. Neighboring McAlister Hall was home to the Conservatory of Music and housed conservatory faculty offices.

College Church, across Washington Street from the college, is not formally associated with the college, although it has long been informally closely associated with the college.

The college holds regular chapel services in Edman Memorial Chapel, named for V. Raymond Edman, the fourth college president, which seats 2,400. Edman died in 1967 while speaking in chapel. He was preaching about being in the presence of the King, and the recording is available in the Wheaton chapel archives. The college also uses the chapel for many events of Wheaton&#x27;s performing arts programs. In 2000, an entirely handcrafted organ made by the Casavant Organ Company of Quebec, Canada, was installed.

===LGBT prohibition===
Students and employees at Wheaton must sign a Community Covenant that classifies &quot;homosexual behavior&quot; as a form of immorality condemned by scripture which they must avoid. The college is listed among the least hospitable in the United States for LGBT students by Campus Pride and The Princeton Review because, among other reasons, the college featured an ex-gay movement speaker in a chapel service.

In 2011, a group of Wheaton alumni established OneWheaton, with the stated purpose of providing allied support to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and similar students and alums at Wheaton and other colleges. 

In 2014 Wheaton hired a gay Christian blogger, Julie Rodgers, as a ministry associate who could reach out to LGBT students while being committed to celibacy. Rodgers reports that college officials asked her not to identify herself as gay and to portray being gay only as a form of &quot;brokenness&quot; rather than something to be celebrated. Having shifted in her position on same-sex marriage, Rodgers could no longer endorse Wheaton&#x27;s policy on sexual ethics, and resigned from Wheaton in 2015.

===Other===

The building was formally named the Billy Graham Center when it housed the famous evangelist&#x27;s corporate records repository. But, in 2018, after Graham&#x27;s death, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association now spearheaded by Graham&#x27;s son, Franklin, moved the archives to Charlotte, mainly due to disagreements about the culturally progressive leanings of the college. Though the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association raised the funds to build the building on Wheaton&#x27;s Campus, it is now called &quot;Billy Graham Hall&quot;. It does not represent the ministry in any way. 

The BGC houses an auditorium, classrooms, several evangelism institutes, a museum of the history of evangelism, the college&#x27;s Archives and Special Collections, and the Wheaton College Graduate School. It also housed the school radio station, WETN 88.1 FM, until its sale in February 2017.

The Women&#x27;s Building renamed Williston Hall in 1930–31 (in honor of longtime Blanchard friend and donor J. P. Williston), was built in 1895. Its construction required the college to borrow $6,000. After seventy-eight years of housing only women, Williston Hall is now a coed dormitory for sophomore students. It opened to men starting in the fall semester of 2009 with the dream that it would become a creative hotspot on campus.

The President&#x27;s House, or Westgate, formerly owned by college trustee John M. Oury, was presented to President Buswell on the tenth anniversary of his inauguration, April 23, 1936. The house served as the home of three of Wheaton&#x27;s subsequent presidents. It now houses the Office of Alumni Relations.

In 1951, HoneyRock, Center for Leadership Development at Wheaton College, was established in Three Lakes, Wisconsin. HoneyRock is not only a year-round camp for young people, but it offers a variety of leadership schools and courses for students. Nearly 3,000 people utilize HoneyRock each year. Through HoneyRock the college owns nearly in Northern Wisconsin.

In July 2012, Wheaton College filed a lawsuit alongside The Catholic University of America in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, opposing the Health and Human Services Preventative Services regulation. The regulation, promulgated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, would have required both institutions to provide access to emergency contraceptive drugs or pay fines. The case was decided in favor of Wheaton College in 2018, resulting in an exemption from the mandate.

==Athletics==
Wheaton&#x27;s athletic teams are the Thunder. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) since the 1967–68 academic year; which they were a member on a previous stint from 1946–47 to 1959–60. The Thunder previously competed in the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) from 1919–20 to 1936–37.

Wheaton competes in 19 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball. Wheaton also competes in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s collegiate rowing, lacrosse, and club soccer.

===Accomplishments===
The men&#x27;s basketball team won the first NCAA Small College National Championship in 1958, defeating Kentucky Wesleyan in the finals, 89–65. The Wheaton men&#x27;s soccer team captured the NCAA Division III Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship in 1984 and 1997, to go with runner-up finishes in 1999, 2006, and 2014. The women&#x27;s soccer team won the NCAA Division III Women&#x27;s Soccer Championship in 2004, 2006, and 2007. Wheaton athletes competed in basketball at the 1904 Summer Olympics. The 1967–68 women&#x27;s basketball team finished their season undefeated in 11 games, including a victory over the University of Iowa.

Gil Dodds (MA &#x27;48), the one-time world record holder for the indoor mile, NCAA cross country champion, and three-time Wanamaker Mile champion, coached men&#x27;s track &amp; field at Wheaton in the late 1940s and 1950s.

===Football===
The school&#x27;s football team is coached by Jesse Scott, who has taken the team to the NCAA Division III Football Championship playoffs three times. The team was previously coached by Mike Swider, who has taken the team to the playoffs nine times.

In 2008, Andy Studebaker was selected in the NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles; he subsequently signed with the Kansas City Chiefs.

===Rowing===
Wheaton College Crew is the official collegiate rowing club of Wheaton College. Wheaton Crew was established in 1989 by Rachel Mariner &#x27;89 who had returned from her junior year at Exeter College, Oxford. It was first solely women&#x27;s crew using the University of Chicago boathouse. Later a group of students, alumni, and donors competing with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s boats; both crews are members of the American Collegiate Rowing Association (ACRA) in the Great Lakes Region. The Wheaton College Crew is registered as a club sport affiliated with Wheaton College Thunder Athletics. The club program is currently the highest level of competitive rowing offered at Wheaton College.

The crew team rows on the Fox River from the dock of Fox Valley Christian Action&#x27;s Riverwoods Campus in St. Charles, Illinois. The Fox is shared with the St. Charles Rowing Club (SCRC) on a residential, no-wake 7 km stretch of river. While no boathouse has been established due to complications with Wheaton College, Wheaton Crew hosts land practices, ergometer training, and tryouts in the Chrouser Sports Complex on Wheaton&#x27;s campus.

Wheaton Crew competes and trains for Head Races in the fall season and 2 km sprints in the spring. Wheaton competes in regattas including the Head of the Hooch, Head of the Charles Regatta and the John Hunter Regatta on Lake Lanier&#x27;s Olympic Park and the Illinois Collegiate Rowing Invitational in Farmer City, Illinois. It does not compete on Sunday in agreement with Wheaton College and Wheaton College Thunder regulations.

The Wheaton Crew Cheer is a long-standing oral tradition of Wheaton oarsmen at the launch of Wheaton boats at regattas. As a strictly oral tradition, this cheer cannot be written down for any purpose. Memorizing the cheer is a rite of passage for Wheaton rowers.

At the transition of captains, both the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s captains are given the first flag and oar of Wheaton Crew as a symbol of power passing from one generation of Wheaton rowers to another. The team introduced the Golden Cox-Tool in 2017 as a similar relic for the Head Coxswain&#x27;s transition.

The 1939 hymn &quot;Victory in Jesus&quot; is sung at the end of every Wheaton Crew racing event following Wheaton College&#x27;s affiliations as an Evangelical Christian establishment.

Wheaton built a gymnasium, later renamed Adams Hall, in 1898. The college renovated it in early 2010 to house the Art Department.
Alumni Gymnasium (renamed the Edward A. Coray Alumni Gymnasium in 1968, in honor of Coach Ed Coray&#x27;s long service), was built during the Edman presidency and paid for by alums. The college laid the cornerstone at homecoming on October 11, 1941. The college placed a copper box in the cornerstone containing a copy of the Wheaton Record, the Wheaton Daily Journal, a college catalog, a student directory, and a copy of the Homecoming program. Wyngarten Health Center was built in 1958, followed by Centennial Gymnasium in 1959–60, which was extensively renovated and expanded in 2000. Now known as King Arena, it is part of the Chrouser Sports Complex (CSC) and houses most of the college&#x27;s athletic and fitness facilities.

==Activism and controversy==
On October 13, 2007, Wheaton College&#x27;s Stanton L. Jones signed interfaith document &quot;Loving God and Neighbor Together: A Christian Response to A Common Word Between Us and You,&quot; agreeing that Islam and Christianity can be at peace with each other.

Wheaton again appeared in the news in 2004 when it dismissed Joshua Hochschild, assistant professor of philosophy, for becoming Roman Catholic. Wheaton&#x27;s president said his &quot;personal desire&quot; to retain Hochschild, &quot;a gifted brother in Christ&quot;, was outweighed by his duty to employ &quot;faculty who embody the institution&#x27;s Protestant convictions&quot;. In 2008, English professor Kent Gramm resigned after declining to give the college administration details of his pending divorce from his wife of 30 years.

In December 2015, Wheaton College suspended a tenured professor of political science Larycia Hawkins, who wrote, &quot;I stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God&quot;. In explaining the decision to place Hawkins on administrative leave, the college referred to &quot;significant questions regarding the theological implications&quot; of her comments. The two officially parted ways in February 2016.

In March 2018, Charles Nagy, a former Wheaton College football player, sued the college and seven former teammates citing the school had attempted to cover up a hazing incident by his former teammates. In 2016, Nagy was kidnapped and beaten by his former teammates before being left on the baseball field in the middle of the night half-naked. Nagy was admitted to a nearby hospital and was diagnosed with two labrum tears requiring surgery. Despite the controversy, three players involved were allowed to compete in the next football game. Nagy alleged that the college administration was aware of the tradition of hazing on the team, but took no action. Wheaton faced additional controversy when it issued a public statement condemning hazing but hired a third-party investigator to discredit Nagy&#x27;s account of the incident.

<text>Totally Spies! is a French anime-influenced animated spy-fi series created by Vincent Chalvon-Demersay and David Michel mainly produced by French company Zodiak Kids &amp; Family France, with seasons three to five being co-produced with Canadian company Image Entertainment Corporation. It focuses on three teenage girls from Beverly Hills, California, who work as undercover agents for the World Organization of Human Protection (WOOHP).

Prior to its debut in France on 3 April 2002 on TF1&#x27;s TFOU block, the series was first shown in the United States on 3 November 2001 on ABC Family before moving to Cartoon Network, and later to Universal Kids for the sixth season. It premiered in Canada on Teletoon on 2 September 2002 for the English version, and on Télétoon for the French version. During its original run, the show spanned five seasons, with 130 episodes and several specials. In 2011, the series was moved to Gulli, with the release of the sixth season in 2013. Following a second hiatus that lasted ten years, a seventh season was premiered in France via Gulli on 12 May 2024, and internationally through both Cartoon Network and Discovery Kids on 4 January 2025; the series is renewed for an eighth season.

&quot;Totally Spies&quot; developed a cult following worldwide. The series also spawned a media franchise with several products tied to it, including various comic books, novels and video games. A prequel film, &quot;Totally Spies! The Movie&quot;, was released theatrically in 2009 in France. A spin-off series titled &quot;The Amazing Spiez!&quot; premiered in 2009 and ran for two seasons.

== Premise ==
The series focuses around the adventures of three teenage girls from Beverly Hills, California – Sam, Clover and Alex – who live a double life as secret agents working for the World Organization of Human Protection (WOOHP). The girls are recruited by the organization&#x27;s leader, Jerry, to solve worsening crime conditions that arise across the globe. The spies sport colourful latex jumpsuits and are provided with various gadgets to aid in their investigations. Their primary missions involve dealing with disgruntled and vengeful criminals who have been inconvenienced in some form in the past. Other missions have the same villains plotting revenge on the spies by ruining their personal lives. Framing each episode is a subplot that focuses on the girls&#x27; everyday lives as high school (and later university) students, dealing with relationships and their longtime high school nemesis Mandy.

== Main characters ==
* Sam (voiced by Claire Guyot in the French dub, Jennifer Hale in seasons 1–6 and Kira Riley in season 7–present of the English dub), is the intellectual of the trio. She acts as an elder sister to her friends, being rational, logical, and the most mature of the group. More sensible than Alex and less superficial than Clover, her intelligence and composure allow her to find effective solutions to complicated problems. Her spy suit is green.
* Clover (voiced by Fily Keita in the French dub, Andrea Taylor in seasons 1–6 and Ali Ryan in season 7–present of the English dub) is the fashionable one of the trio. While she is athletic, agile, and strong, she is also impulsive and spontaneous, never thinking twice before jumping into action. She is always ready to teach villains a lesson, even if she has no chance of winning against them. Her spy suit is red.
* Alex (voiced by Céline Mauge in the French dub, Katie Leigh in seasons 1–2; Katie Griffin in seasons 3–6 and Lori Felipe-Barkin in season 7–present of the English dub) is the heart of the trio. She values her friendship with Sam and Clover above all else and will do anything to keep the trio united and happy. Although she admires Sam and Clover, she effaces somewhat in their presence. She is very affectionate and unafraid to show her feelings. Her spy suit is yellow.
* Jerry (voiced by Jean-Claude Donda in the French dub, Jess Harnell in seasons 1–2; Adrian Truss in seasons 3–6 and Gary Mack in season 7–present of the English dub) is the founder of WOOHP. From seasons one to six, he is the president of the agency and the trio&#x27;s superior. He assigns the trio with missions and takes a certain pleasure in summoning them at inopportune moments. Despite his age, he is sufficiently athletic when helping the trio on certain missions. He remains attached to his cultural roots and often plays with his British phlegm with the trio, who do not hesitate to tease him about his cheesy gentlemanly demeanor.
* Mandy (voiced by Céline Mauge in the French dub, Jennifer Hale in seasons 1–6 and Sarah Naughton in season 7–present of the English dub) is a classmate and rival to the girls in their lives outside of WOOHP. Rich, popular and charismatic, she is in perpetual conflict with the trio, locking heads with them over boys, contests or clothing they covet.
* G.L.A.D.I.S. (seasons 3–4; voiced by Laura Préjean in the French dub and Stevie Vallance in the English dub) is an artificial intelligence that assists Jerry in distributing gadgets during the third and fourth seasons. G.L.A.D.I.S. was dropped from the series before the fifth season, having been sent by Jerry to WOOHP&#x27;s recycling facility.
* Zerlina (season 7; voiced by Déborah Claude in the French dub, and by Alana Barrett-Atkins in the English dub) is Jerry&#x27;s daughter and the new president of WOOHP following her father&#x27;s retirement.
* Toby (season 7; voiced by Gauthier Battoue in the French dub and Arjun Biju in the English dub) is a young high-tech genius that assists Zerlina in the creation and distribution of the girls&#x27;s gadgets.

== Development and production ==
===Seasons 1 to 5 ===
The series&#x27; conception came from the rise of girl groups and female singers in the music industry. Wanting to capitalize on the niche, David Michel and Vincent Chalvon-Demersay put their idea into development, which later shifted into production within a year. According to Michel, the series&#x27; animation style was influenced by anime. The production company, Marathon Media, intended on building on the series brand by forming a three-piece girl band, utilizing German talk show &quot;Arabella&quot; to create it. Using a panel of judges, 20 demo videos were selected and the winners were selected based on the strength of their performance and the series&#x27; viewers. The band was selected and released a single in the spring of 2002, through EMI. According to managing director Dirk Fabarius, &quot;The plan is to eventually create an entire album and establish and promote Totally Spies as a real band.&quot; While the idea did not materialize, the series was promoted through other merchandising. It was announced in Spring 2001 that the series would air in the fall on ABC Family in the United States, and would be distributed to the European countries in the following year. Fox Kids Europe acquired European merchandising rights to the series in July 2001, excluding German-speaking territories.

In an interview with WorldScreen.com, Michel explained that prior to the series, there were a lot of boy action-adventure shows and practically nothing for girls, yet in pop culture, there was Britney Spears and Spice Girls. He explained that the characters are heavily inspired by the movie &quot;Clueless&quot; and wanted to mix that with a James Bond format. When they first pitched the show, it had a moderate response, but when the first season was broadcast, the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; film came out, and suddenly the market was full of girl show properties.

According to an article &quot;Achieving a Global Reach on Children&#x27;s Cultural Markets&quot; by Valerie-Ines de la Ville and Laurent Durup, the series was originally designed to reach an American audience, but has garnered appeal from its humor &quot;based on a stereotypical European vision of American references&quot; while &quot;appearing to be original and innovative to the U.S. audience&quot;. Producer and artistic director Stephane Berry explained that the style &quot;is a melting between the American style, which associates action and comedy, and Japanese design for the aesthetic environment and the emotions expressed through the large eyes of the characters.&quot; Some of the common references have included &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Beverly Hills, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, James Bond and its gadgets, and &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

The head writers for the series were Robert and Michelle Lamoreaux who were based in Los Angeles, and who had worked on Nickelodeon shows. Demersay and Stephane Berry had both recently worked with Saban Entertainment in Europe. In a GeoCities interview, Kate Griffin, who voices Alex, mentioned that the typical session for the three girls is that they would record as an ensemble, but through a phone patch, with Hale and Baker calling from Los Angeles, and herself in Toronto.

Following the end of the fifth season, the series&#x27; movie, &quot;Totally Spies! The Movie&quot;, was produced and released to theatres in France on 22 July 2009. The movie received a telecast release in the United States, on 25 April the following year, coinciding with the airing of the series&#x27; fifth season there.

=== Seasons 6 to present ===
In August 2011, Marathon Media confirmed that production for the sixth season was underway and set to premiere in 2013. The sixth series would be produced only by Marathon in association with TF1 and The Walt Disney Company France. It was later confirmed that 26 episodes would be produced and that the series would be licensed in Spain and Latin America, with European territories following suit. To coincide with the sixth season&#x27;s premiere, Zodiak Kids CP Paris, in association with Château de Versailles Spectacles (CVS) and TF1, organized an event at the Palace of Versailles, taking place during Summer 2013. The event would be preceded with activities including a screening of a special featuring the spies on a mission in the palace gardens.

On 8 January 2022, Thomas Astruc, the creator of &quot;Miraculous Ladybug&quot;, who had previously worked on &quot;Totally Spies!&quot;, announced on Twitter that a new season of the latter was &quot;in the making&quot;. On the 13th, revised character designs for Sam, Alex and Clover were revealed. It was originally set to premiere in 2023, but was later pushed back to 2024. The upcoming series will be produced by Zodiak Kids &amp; Family Studio France, with Ollenom (Production subsidiary of fellow Zodiak Kids &amp; Family subsidiary Monello Productions) as co-producer, and French-broadcaster Gulli and Latin American-broadcaster Discovery Kids as participators. On 25 April 2023, it was announced that Warner Bros. Discovery had acquired broadcast rights to the series in the United States and EMEA regions, where the series would air on Cartoon Network in the United States and stream on Max in EMEA regions. In September 2023, Andrea Baker (the voice actress of Clover) confirmed on her Twitter that she and the rest of the voice cast would not be returning, their roles were recast to Kira Riley, Ali Ryan, Lori Felipe-Barkin and Gary Mack respectively.

On 13 June 2024, it was announced that the show has been renewed for an eighth season.

== Telecast and home media ==
In the U.S., &quot;Totally Spies!&quot; premiered on 3 November 2001 on Fox Family/ABC Family (now Freeform).

As of April 2021, all six seasons of &quot;Totally Spies!&quot; are also available on Amazon Prime Video, which currently has the exclusive streaming rights in the U.S.

This is released on DVD &amp; Blu-ray in the U.S. by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

== Reception ==
Joly Herman of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gave the series a mixed review, rating the show 3 out of 5 stars and writing that &quot;We think it&#x27;s a decent show to catch once in a while, but anything more regular might give viewers the like, slightest headache.&quot; Joe Corey of &quot;Inside Pulse&quot; had a more positive review, calling the show &quot;fun enough for small kids who want a Charlie&#x27;s Angels undercover action show. The trio does their best to balance the fun of being in the espionage game without it being too risky.&quot; Matt Hinrichs of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; gave a positive review, calling the action in the first three seasons &quot;decently written enough for adults to enjoy.&quot;

After four seasons, the show had reached over 130 countries and was met with enthusiasm among ages 6–11 that included both girls and boys, and had a Pokémon-like appeal to a broad range of age and gender. In an interview before season three, David Michel said, &quot;The one thing that surprised us the most is the consistency in the male / female viewership split: from Brazil to Italy, we have a 50% boys 50% girls audience ratio, whereas everybody was predicting the show would score very low on boys.&quot; Scott Stoute of ScreenRant listed the show among his &quot;10 Girl Cartoons (That Guys Secretly Love)&quot; list.

=== Controversy ===
The Parents Television Council, in their March 2006 report, noted that the show did not contain offensive language, but expressed concern about the &quot;nature of the violence of the show&quot; in an episode where rats were released to psychologically torture Jerry and Clover, and the sexual content exampled by a sunblock ad by a bikini-clad woman.

== Other media ==
=== Video games ===
=== Spin-off and crossover ===
A spin-off series called &quot;The Amazing Spiez!&quot; features new characters as spies, retaining Jerry as a regular character in the show.

The show had its world premiere on 15 March 2009, on Disney Channel Asia; and its US premiere on 26 April 2010, on Cartoon Network. In Canada, the show premiered on 2 September 2010 on Teletoon. Only the first season and ten Season 2 episodes aired in the US.

&quot;Totally Spies!&quot; also had a crossover episode in season 5 titled &quot;Totally Mystery Much?&quot; with &quot;Martin Mystery&quot;, a Marathon-produced series that aired from 2003 to 2006.

=== Live-action TV series ===
A live-action television series produced by Gloria Sanchez Productions, Banijay Kids &amp; Family and Amazon MGM Studios is in development at Amazon Prime Video and will premiere in 2025.

<text>The tree pipit (Anthus trivialis) is a small passerine bird which breeds across most of Europe and the Palearctic as far East as the East Siberian Mountains. It is a long-distance migrant moving in winter to Africa and southern Asia. The scientific name is from Latin: &quot;anthus&quot; is the name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific &quot; trivialis&quot; means &quot;common&quot;.

The breeding habitat is open woodland and scrub. The nest is placed on the ground, with usually 4–6 eggs being laid. This species is insectivorous, like its relatives, but will also take seeds.

==Taxonomy==
The tree pipit was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Alauda trivialis&quot;. Linnaeus noted that the species occurred in Sweden. The specific epithet &quot;trivialis&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;common&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; from Latin &quot;trivium&quot; meaning &quot;public street&quot;. The tree pipit is now placed in the genus &quot;Anthus&quot; that was introduced in 1805 by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. t. trivialis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – breeds across Europe to southwest Siberia, north Iran and Turkey, east Kazakhstan, southcentral Siberia, Mongolia and northwest China; winters in India and Africa. Includes proposed subspecies &quot;sibiricus&quot;.
* &quot;A. t. haringtoni&quot; Witherby, 1917 – breeds in northwest Himalayas; winters in central India

==Description==

This is a small pipit, which resembles meadow pipit. It is an undistinguished-looking species, streaked brown above and with black markings on a white belly and buff breast below. It can be distinguished from the slightly smaller meadow pipit by its heavier bill and greater contrast between its buff breast and white belly. Tree pipits more readily perch in trees.

The call is a strong &quot;spek&quot;, unlike the weak call of its relative. The song flight is unmistakable. The bird rises a short distance up from a tree, and then parachutes down on stiff wings, the song becoming more drawn out towards the end.

==Life cycle==

*mid-September to mid-April: lives in sub Saharan Africa
*mid April to beginning of May: migrates and arrives in countries such as the United Kingdom
*beginning of May to August: breeding season, two broods
*August to mid September: flies back to Saharan Africas

==Distribution and habitat==

The tree pipit breeds in habitats with a wooded component, including lowland heath and coppice. It is found mostly in open woodland on the boundary with moorland, or open structured oak woodland – therefore heavy thinning is required to produce a gappy character. It prefers low canopy medium-sized trees, where there is low-growing scrub and bramble less than 2 metres high, so that horizontal visibility is relatively high. It likes a mosaic of grass and bracken, but not very grazed short turf, so light to moderate grazing is preferred.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Tree pipits nest on the ground amongst grass or heather tussocks. The nest is built by the female. The clutch of 4 to 6 eggs is incubated by the female. The eggs hatch after 12–14 days. The chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest after 12–14 days. The nests are sometimes parasitized by the common cuckoo (&quot;Cuculus canorus&quot;).

===Feeding===
Tree pipits mainly eat invertebrates, typically insects but will also eat some plant material. They mostly forage on the ground.

<text>Urban geography is the subdiscipline of geography that derives from a study of cities and urban processes. Urban geographers and urbanists examine various aspects of urban life and the built environment. Scholars, activists, and the public have participated in, studied, and critiqued flows of economic and natural resources, human and non-human bodies, patterns of development and infrastructure, political and institutional activities, governance, decay and renewal, and notions of socio-spatial inclusions, exclusions, and everyday life. Urban geography includes different other fields in geography such as the physical, social, and economic aspects of urban geography. The physical geography of urban environments is essential to understand why a town is placed in a specific area, and how the conditions in the environment play an important role with regards to whether or not the city successfully develops. Social geography examines societal and cultural values, diversity, and other conditions that relate to people in the cities. Economic geography is important to examine the economic and job flow within the urban population. These various aspects involved in studying urban geography are necessary to better understand the layout and planning involved in the development of urban environments worldwide.

== Patterns of Urban Development and Infrastructure ==

The development pattern of a place such as city, neighborhood deals how the building and human activities are arranged and organized on the landscape. Urban environments are composed of hard infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, and soft infrastructure, such as health and social services. The construction of urban areas is facilitated through urban planning and architecture. To combat the negative environmental effects of urban development, green infrastructure such as community gardens and parks, sewage and waste systems, and the use of solar energy have been implemented in many cities. The use of green infrastructure has been effective in responding to climate change and reducing flood risks. Green infrastructure, such as home and urban gardens, have been found to not only improve air quality but also promote mental well-being.

== Flow of Economic and Natural Resources Within Urban Environments ==

Over the years, the development of urban environments has continued to increase due to globalization and urbanization. According to the UN, the world&#x27;s population in urban areas is estimated to increase from 55% to 68% by the year 2050. The increase in the development of urban environments leads to the increase in economic flow and utilization of natural resources. As the population in urban areas continue to grow, the use of direct energy and transport energy tends to increase and is estimated to increase in the future.

According to the study conducted by Creutzig et al., the current energy usage is projected to increase from 240 EJ in 2005 to 730 EJ in the year 2050 if worldwide urbanization continues. As more people move to the cities in search of work, business tends to follow suit. Thus, cities will develop the need for new infrastructures such as schools, hospitals, and various public facilities. The development of these types of soft infrastructure can lead to a positive impact on the residents. For instance, soft infrastructure can promote economic growth through allowing its residents to specialize in different areas of expertise. The diversification of careers within the urban population can increase the economic flow within the urban area.

== Human Interactions Within Urban Environments ==
The development of soft infrastructure within urban areas provide people with ways to connect with one another as a community as well as ways to seek support services. Community infrastructure includes areas and services that allow human beings to interact with one another. Such interactions can be facilitated through health services, educational institutions, outreach centers, and community groups. Human interactions with their urban environments can lead to both positive and negative effects. Humans depend on their environment in order to get essential resources, such as good air quality, food and shelter. This natural environmental dependence can lead to the over exploitation of natural resources as the need for such resources increase. Humans can also modify their environment in order to meet their goals. For instance, humans can clear land or agriculture in order to develop urbanized buildings such as commercial skyscrapers and public housing. The clearing of land to pave the way for urbanization can lead to negative environmental impacts such as deforestation, decreased air quality, and wild life displacement.

== Social and Political Flow Within Urban Environments ==
As populations within cities grew over the years, the need to create forms of local government emerged. To maintain order within developing cities, politicians are elected to address environmental and societal issues within the population. For instance, the influence of local and state political dynamics plays an important role in how actions are taken place to combat climate change and housing issues.

== Impact of Urban Geography ==

=== Environmental Impact ===
The environment of urban areas is developed through the concept of urbanization. Urbanization is the transition from rural town-structured communities to urban city-structured communities. This transition is because humans are pulled to cities because of jobs and even welfare. In cities, problems will arise such as environmental degradation. The increasing population can lead to poor air quality and quality and availability of water. The growth of urbanization can lead to more use of energy which leads to air pollution and can impact human health. Flash flooding is another environmental hazard that can occur due to urban development. The concept of urbanization plays an important role in the study of urban geography because it involves the formation of urban infrastructures such as sanitation, sewage systems, and the distribution of electricity and gas.

=== Societal Impact ===
The migration form rural to urbanized areas is fueled by their search for jobs, education, and social welfare. There are trends in urbanization that are influenced by push and pull factors. The push factors include the increasingly high growth of rural areas which leads many people to migrate to the cities in search of better livelihood opportunities, a good quality of life, and a higher standard of living. People are forced to leave their rural homes and move to various cities because of various factors such as low agricultural productivity, poverty, and food insecurity. In addition to the push factors, there are also the pull factors, which &quot;pull&quot; people to cities for better opportunities, better education, proper public health facilities, and also entertainment which offers employment opportunities. The gentrification of urban environments leads to an increase in income gaps, racial inequality, and displacement within metropolitan areas. The negative environmental impacts of urbanization disproportionately effects minority low income areas more than higher income communities.

=== Climate Impact ===
The increasing demand for new building infrastructure within densely populated cities resulted in an increase in air pollution due to the high energy usage within these urban areas. The increasing energy use leads to an increase in heat emissions, which results in global warming. Cities are a key contributor to climate change because urban activities are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It was estimated that cities are responsible for about 75% of global carbon dioxide emissions, with the inclusion of transportation and buildings being the largest contributor. In order to combat the negative environmental impacts urbanization, many modern cities develop environmentally conscious infrastructure. For instance, the implementation of public transportation such as train and bus systems help to lessen the use of cars within cities. The use of solar energy can also be found in many commercial and residential buildings, which helps to lessen the reliance on non-renewable energy resources.

=== Biodiversity Impact ===
Urbanization has a great impact on biodiversity. As cities develop, vital habitats are destroyed or fragmented into patches which leads to them not being big enough to support complex ecological communities. In cities, species can become endangered or locally extinct. The human population is the main contributor to the expansion of urban areas. As urban areas grow from increasing human population and from migration, this can result in deforestation, habitat loss, and extraction of freshwater from the environment which can decrease biodiversity and alter the species ranges and interaction. Some additional cause-and-effect relationships between urban geography and ecosystems include habitat loss which decreases the species&#x27; populations, ranges, and interaction among organisms, the life cycles, and traits can help species survive and reproduce in disturbed ecosystems. The paving of land with concrete can increase water runoff, increase erosion, and soil quality can also decrease.

==Research interest==
Urban geographers are primarily concerned with the ways in which cities and towns are constructed, governed and experienced. Alongside neighboring disciplines such as urban anthropology, urban planning and urban sociology, urban geography mostly investigates the impact of urban processes on the earth&#x27;s surface&#x27;s social and physical structures. Urban geographical research can be part of both human geography and physical geography.

The two fundamental aspects of cities and towns, from the geographic perspective are:
# Location (&quot;systems of cities&quot;): spatial distribution and the complex patterns of movement, flows and linkages that bind them in space; and 
# Urban structure (&quot;cities as systems&quot;): study of patterns of distribution and interaction within cities, from quantitative, qualitative, structural, and behavioral perspectives.

==Research topics==

===Cities as centers of manufacturing and services===
Cities differ in their economic makeup, their social and demographic characteristics, and the roles they play within the city system. One can trace these differences back to regional variations in the local resources on which growth was based during the early development of the urban pattern and in part to the subsequent shifts in the competitive advantage of regions brought about by changing locational forces affecting regional specialization within the framework of a market economy. The recognition of different city types is critical for the classification of cities in urban geography. For such classification, emphasis given in particular to &quot;functional town classification&quot; and the basic underlying dimensions of the city system.

The purpose of classifying cities is twofold. On the one hand, it is undertaken to search reality for hypotheses. In this context, the recognition of different types of cities on the basis of, for example, their functional specialization may enable the identification of spatial regularities in the distribution and structure of urban functions and the formulation of hypotheses about the resulting patterns. On the other hand, classification is undertaken to structure reality in order to test specific hypotheses that have already been formulated. For example, to test the hypotheses that cities with a diversified economy grow at a faster rate then those with a more specialized economic base, cities must first be classified so that diversified and specialized cities can be differentiated.

The simplest way to classify cities is to identify the distinctive role they play in the city system. There are three distinct roles:

# &quot;central places&quot; functioning primarily as service centers for local hinterlands
# &quot;transportation&quot; cities performing break-of-bulk and allied functions for larger regions
# &quot;specialized-function&quot; cities, dominated by one activity such as mining, manufacturing or recreation and serving national and international markets

The composition of a city&#x27;s labor force has traditionally been regarded as the best indicator of functional specialization, and different city types have been most frequently identified from the analysis of employment profiles. Specialization in a given activity is said to exist when employment in it exceeds some critical level.

The relationship between the city system and the development of manufacturing has become very apparent. The rapid growth and spread of cities within the heartland-hinterland framework after 1870 was conditioned to a large extent by industrial developments, and the decentralization of population within the urban system in recent years is related in large part to the movement of employment in manufacturing away from traditional industrial centers. Manufacturing is found in nearly all cities, but its importance is measured by the proportion of total earnings received by the inhabitants of an urban area. When 25 percent or more of the total earnings in an urban region derive from manufacturing, that urban area is arbitrarily designated as a manufacturing center.

The location of manufacturing is affected by myriad economic and non-economic factors, such as the nature of the material inputs, the factors of production, the market and transportation costs. Other important influences include agglomeration and external economies, public policy and personal preferences. Although it is difficult to evaluate precisely the effect of the market on the location of manufacturing activities, two considerations are involved:

* the nature of and demand for the product
* transportation costs

=== Urbanization ===
Urbanization, the transformation of population from rural to urban, is a major phenomenon of the modern era and a central topic of study.

== History of the discipline ==
Urban geography arrived as a critical sub-discipline with the 1973 publication of David Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Social Justice and the City&quot;, which was heavily influenced by previous work by Anne Buttimer. Prior to its emergence as its own discipline, urban geography served as the academic extension of what was otherwise a professional development and planning practice. At the turn of the 19th century, urban planning began as a profession charged with mitigating the negative consequences of industrialization as documented by Friedrich Engels in his geographic analysis of the condition of the working class in England, 1844.

In a 1924 study of urban geography, Marcel Aurousseau observed that urban geography cannot be considered a subdivision of geography because it plays such an important part. However, urban geography did emerge as a specialized discipline after World War II, amidst increasing urban planning and a shift away from the primacy of physical terrain in the study of geography. Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman were among its earliest exponents.

Urban geography arose by the 1930s in the Soviet Union as an academic complement to active urbanization and communist urban planning, focusing on cities&#x27; economic roles and potential.

Spatial analysis, behavioral analysis, Marxism, humanism, social theory, feminism, and postmodernism have arisen (in approximately this order) as overlapping lenses used within the field of urban geography in the West.

Geographic information science, using digital processing of large data sets, has become widely used since the 1980s, with major applications for urban geography.

<text>Eugene George Istomin (November 26, 1925October 10, 2003) was an American pianist. He was a winner of the Leventritt Award and recorded extensively as a soloist and in a piano trio in which he collaborated with Isaac Stern and Leonard Rose.

==Career==
Born in New York City of Russian-Jewish and Ukrainian-Jewish parents, Istomin was a child prodigy who in his early years studied at the Mannes School of Music. His earliest public performances began at age six with his mother, and at 13 he entered the Curtis Institute, having had earlier advice from Alexander Siloti and his daughter Kyriena. He went on to study under Rudolf Serkin and Mieczysław Horszowski. He also studied with Sascha Gorodnitzki.

In 1943, at the age of 17, he won the Leventritt award and the Philadelphia Youth Award. He made his debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra with Eugene Ormandy, playing a concerto by Chopin, and the New York Philharmonic conducted by Artur Rodziński playing Brahms&#x27; Piano Concerto No. 2 in the same week in 1943.

He performed with the conductor Rodzinski and the New York Philharmonic a second time in December 1944, playing Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth Piano Concerto.

His first recording, which brought him considerable acclaim, was of Bach&#x27;s D minor Concerto with the Busch Chamber Players.

Starting in 1950, Istomin became a regular participant at the Prades Festival organized by the famous cellist Pablo Casals.

He commissioned and premiered Roger Sessions&#x27;s piano concerto in 1956. Several other composers, including Henri Dutilleux and Ned Rorem, wrote music for him.

The Istomin-Stern-Rose Trio he formed with Isaac Stern and Leonard Rose made many recordings, particularly of music by Beethoven, Brahms and Schubert. He won a Grammy Award in 1970 with the Istomin-Stern-Rose Trio for their recordings of Beethoven. He also was known as a soloist, performing many concerts of orchestral music, with conductors such as Eugene Ormandy, Bruno Walter, Leonard Bernstein, Fritz Reiner, George Szell and Leopold Stokowski.

He recorded extensively for Columbia (later Sony Classical), solo works and chamber music. As late as 2001, he made the world premiere recording of Paul Paray&#x27;s &quot;Fantaisie for Piano and Orchestra&quot;, with the Budapest Symphony Orchestra under Jean-Bernard Pommier.

He married Marta Montañez Martínez (Marta Casals Istomin), the widow of Pablo Casals, on February 15, 1975. She is a former president of the Manhattan School of Music and former artistic director of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. He moved to Washington in 1980.

He was an avid reader and book collector and, eventually, attracted the interest of New York publishing magnate, William Jovanovich. In 1980, Istomin was hired by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Publishers to advise the company in the publication of facsimile editions of original editions by Joseph Conrad and Thomas Hardy, among others.

In the 1980s and 1990s, he toured 30 American cities—largely in the Midwest—in a twelve-ton truck with his own Steinway pianos and piano tuner. It was the expression of a lifelong conviction that classical music belonged to the ordinary American. In this same vein, he was an ardent fan of the Detroit Tigers baseball team.

Better known in Europe than in the United States, Eugene Istomin received the French Légion d&#x27;honneur in 2001.

He died of liver cancer in 2003 at his home in Washington.

It is a long-distance migrant moving in winter to southern Asia and Indonesia. Sometimes it is also called Indian pipit or Hodgson&#x27;s pipit, as well as tree pipit owing to its resemblance with the tree pipit. However, its back is more olive-toned and less streaked than that species, and its head pattern is different with a better-marked supercilium.

<text>In molecular biology, a reporter gene (often simply reporter) is a gene that researchers attach to a regulatory sequence of another gene of interest in bacteria, cell culture, animals or plants. Such genes are called reporters because the characteristics they confer on organisms expressing them are easily identified and measured, or because they are selectable markers. Reporter genes are often used as an indication of whether a certain gene has been taken up by or expressed in the cell or organism population.

==Common reporter genes==
To introduce a reporter gene into an organism, scientists place the reporter gene and the gene of interest in the same DNA construct to be inserted into the cell or organism. For bacteria or prokaryotic cells in culture, this is usually in the form of a circular DNA molecule called a plasmid. For viruses, this is known as a viral vector. It is important to use a reporter gene that is not natively expressed in the cell or organism under study, since the expression of the reporter is being used as a marker for successful uptake of the gene of interest.

Commonly used reporter genes that induce visually identifiable characteristics usually involve fluorescent and luminescent proteins. Examples include the gene that encodes jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP), which causes cells that express it to glow green under blue or ultraviolet light, the enzyme luciferase, which catalyzes a reaction with luciferin to produce light, and the red fluorescent protein from the gene . The GUS gene has been commonly used in plants but luciferase and GFP are becoming more common.

A common reporter in bacteria is the &quot;E. coli&quot; &quot;lacZ&quot; gene, which encodes the protein beta-galactosidase. This enzyme causes bacteria expressing the gene to appear blue when grown on a medium that contains the substrate analog X-gal. An example of a selectable marker which is also a reporter in bacteria is the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, which confers resistance to the antibiotic chloramphenicol.

==Transformation and transfection assays==
Many methods of transfection and transformation – two ways of expressing a foreign or modified gene in an organism – are effective in only a small percentage of a population subjected to the techniques. Thus, a method for identifying those few successful gene uptake events is necessary. Reporter genes used in this way are normally expressed under their own promoter (DNA regions that initiates gene transcription) independent from that of the introduced gene of interest; the reporter gene can be expressed constitutively (that is, it is &quot;always on&quot;) or inducibly with an external intervention such as the introduction of Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in the β-galactosidase system. As a result, the reporter gene&#x27;s expression is independent of the gene of interest&#x27;s expression, which is an advantage when the gene of interest is only expressed under certain specific conditions or in tissues that are difficult to access.

In the case of selectable-marker reporters such as CAT, the transfected population of bacteria can be grown on a substrate that contains chloramphenicol. Only those cells that have successfully taken up the construct containing the CAT gene will survive and multiply under these conditions.

==Gene expression assays==
Reporter genes can be used to assay for the expression of a gene of interest that is normally difficult to quantitatively assay. Reporter genes can produce a protein that has little obvious or immediate effect on the cell culture or organism. They are ideally not present in the native genome to be able to isolate reporter gene expression as a result of the gene of interest&#x27;s expression.

To activate reporter genes, they can be expressed constitutively, where they are directly attached to the gene of interest to create a gene fusion. This method is an example of using &quot;cis&quot;-acting elements where the two genes are under the same promoter elements and are transcribed into a single messenger RNA molecule. The mRNA is then translated into protein. It is important that both proteins be able to properly fold into their active conformations and interact with their substrates despite being fused. In building the DNA construct, a segment of DNA coding for a flexible polypeptide linker region is usually included so that the reporter and the gene product will only minimally interfere with one another. Reporter genes can also be expressed by induction during growth. In these cases, &quot;trans&quot;-acting elements, such as transcription factors are used to express the reporter gene.

Reporter gene assay have been increasingly used in high throughput screening (HTS) to identify small molecule inhibitors and activators of protein targets and pathways for drug discovery and chemical biology. Because the reporter enzymes themselves (e.g. firefly luciferase) can be direct targets of small molecules and confound the interpretation of HTS data, novel coincidence reporter designs incorporating artifact suppression have been developed.

==Promoter assays==
Reporter genes can be used to assay for the activity of a particular promoter in a cell or organism. In this case there is no separate &quot;gene of interest&quot;; the reporter gene is simply placed under the control of the target promoter and the reporter gene product&#x27;s activity is quantitatively measured. The results are normally reported relative to the activity under a &quot;consensus&quot; promoter known to induce strong gene expression.

==Further uses==
A more complex use of reporter genes on a large scale is in two-hybrid screening, which aims to identify proteins that natively interact with one another &quot;in vivo&quot;.

<text>Hume&#x27;s leaf warbler or Hume&#x27;s warbler (Phylloscopus humei) is a small leaf warbler which breeds in the mountains of inner Asia. This warbler is migratory and winters mainly in India.

The English name and the specific &quot;humei&quot; commemorate Allan Octavian Hume, a British civil
servant and ornithologist based in India. The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). Like most similar songbirds, it was formerly included in the &quot;Old World warbler&quot; assemblage.

==Description==

Hume&#x27;s leaf warbler is one of the smallest &quot;Old World warblers&quot;. Like most other leaf warblers, it has greenish upperparts and off-white underparts. With its long supercilium, crown stripe and yellow-margined tertial remiges, it is very similar to the yellow-browed warbler (&quot;P. inornatus&quot;). However, it has only one prominent light wing bar, just a faint vestige of the second shorter wing bar, and overall duller colours. It also has a dark lower mandible and legs.

Its song is buzzing and high-pitched. The best distinction from the yellow-browed warbler is the more disyllabic call. While the eastern and western Hume&#x27;s leaf warblers already show noticeable differences in mtDNA sequence and calls, their songs do not differ; they are reproductively isolated only by allopatry and not usually considered separate species.

==Ecology and evolution==
This is a common bird of mountain woodlands at altitudes of up to 3,500m ASL. It occurs from the Hindu Kush and Karakoram east and north to the Tien Shan in China and the Altay Mountains in Mongolia. The completely allopatric subspecies &quot;mandellii&quot; (Mandell&#x27;s leaf warbler or eastern Hume&#x27;s warbler) – sometimes separated as a full species, in which case the nominate subspecies is called western Hume&#x27;s warbler – occurs on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Both populations migrate over the Himalayas to winter in India and adjacent regions. The species has also been recorded in the Kutch region.
Particularly on autumn migration, this tiny warbler is prone to vagrancy as far as western Europe, despite a 3,000 km distance from its breeding grounds. It is a rare vagrant in late autumn and winter in Great Britain. Non-breeding adults may stray around a lot in summer, when Mandell&#x27;s leaf warblers are fairly common summer visitors to subtropical and temperate montane humid forests of Bhutan, around 2,000-3,500m ASL and dominated by Bhutan fir (&quot;Abies densa&quot;) or by Himalayan hemlock (&quot;Tsuga dumosa&quot;) and rhododendrons, though the subspecies is not a regular breeder in that country.

This bird is not shy, although its arboreal lifestyle and cryptic colours make it difficult to observe. It is constantly in motion. Like most &quot;Old World warblers&quot;, this small passerine is insectivorous. The nest is built on the ground.

A common species in most of its wide range, Hume&#x27;s leaf-warbler is not considered threatened by the IUCN.

It was recently split from the yellow-browed warbler (&quot;Phylloscopus inornatus&quot;), based on differences in morphology, bioacoustics, and molecular characters. The western Hume&#x27;s leaf warbler&#x27;s range overlaps with that of the yellow-browed warbler in the western Sayan Mountains, but the species apparently do not hybridize. The divergence between the two species has been tentatively estimated at 2.5 million years ago (mya), and that between &quot;P. h. humei&quot; and &quot;P. h. mandelli&quot; at about 1 mya.

<doc id="341043" wikidata="Q3875690" url="?curid=341043" title="16th Street Baptist Church bombing">
<text>The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing was a terrorist bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama on September 15, 1963. The bombing was committed by a white supremacist terrorist group. Four members of a local Ku Klux Klan (KKK) chapter planted 19 sticks of dynamite attached to a timing device beneath the steps located on the east side of the church.

Described by Martin Luther King Jr. as &quot;one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity,&quot; the explosion at the church killed four girls and injured between 14 and 22 other people.

Although the Federal Bureau of Investigation had concluded in 1965 that the bombing had been committed by four known KKK members and segregationists: Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr., Herman Frank Cash, Robert Edward Chambliss, and Bobby Frank Cherry, no prosecutions were conducted until 1977, when Robert Chambliss was tried by Attorney General of Alabama Bill Baxley and convicted of the first-degree murder of one of the victims, 11-year-old Carol Denise McNair.

As part of an effort by state and federal prosecutors to reopen and try cold cases involving murder and domestic terrorism from the civil rights era, the State of Alabama placed both Blanton Jr. and Cherry on trial, who were each convicted of four counts of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Future United States Senator Doug Jones successfully prosecuted Blanton and Cherry. Herman Cash died in 1994, and was never charged with his alleged involvement in the bombing.

The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing marked a turning point in the United States during the civil rights movement and also contributed to support for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by Congress.

==Background==
In the years leading up to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, Birmingham had earned a national reputation as a tense, violent and racially segregated city, in which even tentative racial integration in any form was met with violent resistance. Martin Luther King Jr. described Birmingham as &quot;probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States.&quot; Birmingham&#x27;s Commissioner of Public Safety, Theophilus Eugene &quot;Bull&quot; Connor, led the effort in enforcing racial segregation in the city through the use of violent tactics.

Black and white residents of Birmingham were segregated between different public amenities such as water fountains and places of public gathering such as movie theaters. The city had no black police officers or firefighters and most black residents could expect to find only menial employment in professions such as cooks and cleaners. Black residents did not just experience segregation in the context of leisure and employment, but also in the context of their freedom and well-being. Given the state&#x27;s disenfranchisement of most black people since the turn of the century, by making voter registration essentially impossible, few of the city&#x27;s black residents were registered to vote. Bombings at black homes and institutions were a regular occurrence, with at least 21 separate explosions recorded at black properties and churches in the eight years before 1963. However, none of these explosions had resulted in fatalities. These attacks earned the city the nickname &quot;Bombingham&quot;.
===Birmingham Campaign===

 Civil Rights activists and leaders in Birmingham fought against the city&#x27;s deeply-ingrained and institutionalized racism with tactics that included the targeting of Birmingham&#x27;s economic and social disparities. Their demands included that public amenities such as lunch counters and parks be desegregated, the criminal charges against demonstrators and protestors should be removed&quot;,&quot; and an end to overt discrimination with regards to employment opportunities. The intentional scope of these activities was to see the end of segregation across Birmingham and the South as a whole. The work these Civil Rights activists were engaged in within Birmingham was crucial to the movement as the Birmingham campaign was seen as guidance for other cities in the South with regards to rising against segregation and racism.

The three-story 16th Street Baptist Church was a rallying point for civil rights activities through the spring of 1963. When the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the Congress on Racial Equality became involved in a campaign to register African Americans to vote in Birmingham, tensions in the city increased. The church was used as a meeting-place for civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, and Fred Shuttlesworth, for organizing and educating marchers. It was the location where students were organized and trained by the SCLC Director of Direct Action, James Bevel, to participate in the 1963 Birmingham campaign&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Crusade after other marches had taken place.

On Thursday, May 2, more than 1,000 students, some reportedly as young as eight, opted to leave school and gather at the 16th Street Baptist Church. Demonstrators present were given instructions to march to downtown Birmingham and discuss with the mayor their concerns about racial segregation in the city, and to integrate buildings and businesses currently segregated. Although this march was met with fierce resistance and criticism, and 600 arrests were made on the first day alone, the Birmingham campaign and its Children&#x27;s Crusade continued until May 5. The intention was to fill the jail with protesters. These demonstrations led to an agreement, on May 8, between the city&#x27;s business leaders and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, to integrate public facilities, including schools, in the city within 90 days. (The first three schools in Birmingham to be integrated would do so on September 4.)

These demonstrations and the concessions from city leaders to the majority of demonstrators&#x27; demands were met with fierce resistance by other whites in Birmingham. In the weeks following the September 4 integration of public schools, three additional bombs were detonated in Birmingham. Other acts of violence followed the settlement, and several staunch Klansmen were known to have expressed frustration at what they saw as a lack of effective resistance to integration.

As a known and popular rallying point for civil rights activists, the 16th Street Baptist Church was an obvious target.

==Bombing==
In the early morning of Sunday, September 15, 1963, several members of the United Klans of America—Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr., Robert Edward Chambliss, Bobby Frank Cherry, and, allegedly, Herman Frank Cash—planted a minimum of 15 sticks of dynamite with a time delay under the steps of the church, close to the basement.
At approximately 10:22 a.m., an anonymous man phoned the 16th Street Baptist Church. The call was answered by the acting Sunday School secretary, a 15-year-old girl named Carolyn Maull. The anonymous caller simply said the words, &quot;Three minutes&quot; to Maull before terminating the call. Less than one minute later, the bomb exploded. Five children were in the basement at the time of the explosion, in a restroom close to the stairwell, changing into choir robes in preparation for a sermon entitled &quot;A Rock That Will Not Roll&quot;. According to one survivor, the explosion shook the entire building and propelled the girls&#x27; bodies through the air &quot;like rag dolls&quot;.

The explosion blew a hole measuring in diameter in the church&#x27;s rear wall, and a crater wide and deep in the ladies&#x27; basement lounge, destroying the rear steps to the church and blowing a passing motorist out of his car. Several other cars parked near the site of the blast were destroyed, and windows of properties located more than two blocks from the church were also damaged. All but one of the church&#x27;s stained-glass windows were destroyed in the explosion. The sole stained-glass window largely undamaged in the explosion depicted Christ leading a group of young children.

Hundreds of individuals, some of them lightly wounded, converged on the church to search the debris for survivors as police erected barricades around the church and several outraged men scuffled with police. An estimated 2,000 black people converged on the scene in the hours following the explosion. The church&#x27;s pastor, the Reverend John Cross Jr., attempted to placate the crowd by loudly reciting the 23rd Psalm through a bullhorn.

Four girls—Addie Mae Collins (age 14, born April 18, 1949), Carol Denise McNair (age 11, born November 17, 1951), Carole Rosamond Robertson (age 14, born April 24, 1949), and Cynthia Dionne Wesley (age 14, born April 30, 1949)—were killed in the attack. The explosion was so intense that one of the girls&#x27; bodies was decapitated and so badly mutilated that her body could be identified only through her clothing and a ring. Another victim was killed by a piece of mortar embedded in her skull. The pastor of the church, the Reverend John Cross, recollected in 2001 that the girls&#x27; bodies were found &quot;stacked on top of each other, clung together&quot;. All four girls were pronounced dead on arrival at the Hillman Emergency Clinic.

Between 14 and 22 additional people were injured in the explosion, one of whom was Addie Mae&#x27;s younger sister, 12-year-old Sarah Collins. She had 21 pieces of glass embedded in her face and was blinded in one eye. In her later recollections of the bombing, Collins would recall that in the moments immediately before the explosion, she had watched her sister, Addie, tying her dress sash. Another sister of Addie Mae Collins, 16-year-old Junie Collins, would later recall that shortly before the explosion, she had been sitting in the basement of the church reading the Bible and had observed Addie Mae Collins tying the dress sash of Carol Denise McNair before she returned upstairs to the ground floor of the church.

==Reactions==
===Unrest and tensions===

Violence escalated in Birmingham in the hours following the bombing, with reports of groups of black and white youth throwing bricks and shouting insults at each other. Police urged parents of black and white youths to keep their children indoors, as the Governor of Alabama, George Wallace, ordered an additional 300 state police and 500 Alabama National Guardsmen to assist in quelling unrest. The Birmingham City Council convened an emergency meeting to propose safety measures for the city, although proposals for a curfew were rejected. Within 24 hours of the bombing, a minimum of five businesses and properties had been firebombed and numerous cars—most of which were driven by whites—had been stoned by rioting youths.

In response to the church bombing, described by the Mayor of Birmingham, Albert Boutwell, as &quot;just sickening&quot;, the Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, dispatched 25 FBI agents, including explosives experts, to Birmingham to conduct a thorough forensic investigation.
Although reports of the bombing and the loss of four children&#x27;s lives were glorified by white supremacists, who in many instances chose to celebrate the loss as &quot;four less niggers&quot;, as news of the church bombing and the fact that four young girls had been killed in the explosion reached the national and international press, many felt that they had not taken the civil rights struggle seriously enough. The day following the bombing, a young white lawyer named Charles Morgan Jr. addressed a meeting of businessmen, condemning the acquiescence of white people in Birmingham toward the oppression of blacks. In this speech, Morgan lamented: &quot;Who did it [the bombing]? We all did it! The &#x27;who&#x27; is every little individual who talks about the &#x27;niggers&#x27; and spreads the seeds of his hate to his neighbor and his son ... What&#x27;s it like living in Birmingham? No one ever really has known and no one will until this city becomes part of the United States.&quot; A &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; editorial opined, &quot;For the rest of the nation, the Birmingham church bombing should serve to goad the conscience. The deaths ... in a sense, are on the hands of each of us.&quot;

Two more black youths, Johnny Robinson and Virgil Ware, were shot to death in Birmingham within seven hours of the Sunday morning bombing. Robinson, aged 16, was shot in the back by Birmingham police officer Jack Parker as he fled down an alley, after ignoring police orders to halt. The police were reportedly responding to black youths throwing rocks at cars driven by white people. Robinson died before reaching the hospital. Ware, aged 13, was shot in the cheek and chest with a revolver in a residential suburb north of the city. A 16-year-old white youth named Larry Sims fired the gun (given to him by another youth named Michael Farley) at Ware, who was sitting on the handlebars of a bicycle ridden by his brother. Sims and Farley had been riding home from an anti-integration rally which had denounced the church bombing. When he spotted Ware and his brother, Sims fired twice, reportedly with his eyes closed. (Sims and Farley were later convicted of second-degree manslaughter, although the judge suspended their sentences and imposed two years&#x27; probation upon each youth.)

Some civil rights activists blamed George Wallace, Governor of Alabama and an outspoken segregationist, for creating the climate that had led to the killings. One week before the bombing, Wallace granted an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in which he said he believed Alabama needed a &quot;few first-class funerals&quot; to stop racial integration.

The city of Birmingham initially offered a $52,000 reward for the arrest of the bombers. Governor Wallace offered an additional $5,000 on behalf of the state of Alabama. Although this donation was accepted, Martin Luther King Jr. is known to have sent Wallace a telegram saying, &quot;the blood of four little children ... is on your hands. Your irresponsible and misguided actions have created in Birmingham and Alabama the atmosphere that has induced continued violence and now murder.&quot;

===Funerals===
Carole Rosamond Robertson was laid to rest in a private family funeral held on September 17, 1963. Reportedly, Carole&#x27;s mother, Alpha, had expressly requested that her daughter be buried separately from the other victims. She was distressed about a remark made by Martin Luther King, who had said that the mindset that enabled the murder of the four girls was the &quot;apathy and complacency&quot; of black people in Alabama.

The service for Carole Rosamond Robertson was held at St. John&#x27;s African Methodist Episcopal Church. In attendance were 1,600 people. At this service, the Reverend C. E. Thomas told the congregation: &quot;The greatest tribute you can pay to Carole is to be calm, be lovely, be kind, be innocent.&quot; Carole Robertson was buried in a blue casket at Shadow Lawn Cemetery.
On September 18, the funeral of the three other girls killed in the bombing was held at the Sixth Avenue Baptist Church. Although no city officials attended this service, an estimated 800 clergymen of all races were among the attendees. Also present was Martin Luther King Jr. In a speech conducted before the burials of the girls, King addressed an estimated 3,300 mourners—including numerous white people—with a speech saying: 
As the girls&#x27; coffins were taken to their graves, King directed that those present remain solemn and forbade any singing, shouting or demonstrations. These instructions were relayed to the crowd present by a single youth with a bullhorn.

==Initial investigation==
Initially, investigators theorized that a bomb thrown from a passing car had caused the explosion at the 16th Street Baptist church. But by September 20, the FBI was able to confirm that the explosion had been caused by a device that was purposely planted beneath the steps to the church, close to the women&#x27;s lounge. A section of wire and remnants of red plastic were discovered there, which could have been part of a timing device. (The plastic remnants were later lost by investigators.)

Within days of the bombing, investigators began to focus their attention upon a KKK splinter group known as the &quot;Cahaba Boys&quot;. The Cahaba Boys had formed earlier in 1963, as they felt that the KKK was becoming restrained and impotent in response to concessions granted to black people to end racial segregation. This group had previously been linked to several bomb attacks at black-owned businesses and the homes of black community leaders throughout the spring and summer of 1963. Although the Cahaba Boys had fewer than 30 active members, among them were Thomas Blanton Jr., Herman Cash, Robert Chambliss, and Bobby Cherry.

Investigators also gathered numerous witness statements attesting to a group of white men in a turquoise 1957 Chevrolet who had been seen near the church in the early hours of the morning of September 15. These witness statements specifically indicated that a white man had exited the car and walked toward the steps of the church. (The physical description by witnesses of this person varied, and could have matched either Bobby Cherry or Robert Chambliss.)

Chambliss was questioned by the FBI on September 26. On September 29, he was indicted upon charges of illegally purchasing and transporting dynamite on September 4, 1963. He and two acquaintances, John Hall and Charles Cagle, were each convicted in state court upon a charge of illegally possessing and transporting dynamite on October 8. Each received a $100 fine () and a suspended 180-day jail sentence. At the time, no federal charges were filed against Chambliss or any of his fellow conspirators in relation to the bombing.

===FBI closure of case===
The FBI encountered difficulties in their initial investigation into the bombing. A later report stated: &quot;By 1965, we had [four] serious suspects—namely Thomas Blanton Jr., Herman Frank Cash, Robert Chambliss, and Bobby Frank Cherry, all Klan members—but witnesses were reluctant to talk and physical evidence was lacking. Also, at that time, information from our surveillance was not admissible in court. As a result, no federal charges were filed in the &#x27;60s.&quot;

On May 13, 1965, local investigators and the FBI formally named Blanton, Cash, Chambliss, and Cherry as the perpetrators of the bombing, with Robert Chambliss the likely ringleader of the four. This information was relayed to the Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover; however, no prosecutions of the four suspects ensued. There had been a history of mistrust between local and federal investigators. Later the same year, J. Edgar Hoover formally blocked any impending federal prosecutions against the suspects, and refused to disclose any evidence his agents had obtained with state or federal prosecutors.

In 1968, the FBI formally closed their investigation into the bombing without filing charges against any of their named suspects. The files were sealed by order of J. Edgar Hoover.

==Resulting legislation==
The Birmingham campaign, the March on Washington in August, the September bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church, and the November assassination of John F. Kennedy—an ardent supporter of the civil rights cause who had proposed a Civil Rights Act of 1963 on national television—increased worldwide awareness of and sympathy toward the civil rights cause in the United States.

Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, newly-inaugurated President Lyndon Johnson continued to press for passage of the civil rights bill sought by his predecessor.

On July 2, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed into effect the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In attendance were major leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, including Martin Luther King Jr. This legislation prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, or national origin; to ensure full, equal rights of African Americans before the law.

==Formal reopening of the investigation==
Officially, the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing remained unsolved until after William Baxley was elected Attorney General of Alabama in January 1971. Baxley had been a student at the University of Alabama when he heard about the bombing in 1963, and later recollected: &quot;I wanted to do something, but I didn&#x27;t know what.&quot;

Within one week of being sworn into office, Baxley had researched original police files into the bombing, discovering that the original police documents were &quot;mostly worthless&quot;. Baxley formally reopened the case in 1971. He was able to build trust with key witnesses, some of whom had been reluctant to testify in the first investigation. Other witnesses obtained identified Chambliss as the individual who had placed the bomb beneath the church. Baxley also gathered evidence proving Chambliss had purchased dynamite from a store in Jefferson County less than two weeks before the bomb was planted, upon the pretext the dynamite was to be used to clear land the KKK had purchased near Highway 101. This testimony of witnesses and evidence was used to formally construct a case against Robert Chambliss.

After Baxley requested access to the original FBI files on the case, he learned that evidence accumulated by the FBI against the named suspects between 1963 and 1965 had not been revealed to the local prosecutors in Birmingham. Although he met with initial resistance from the FBI, in 1976 Baxley was formally presented with some of the evidence which had been compiled by the FBI, after he publicly threatened to expose the Department of Justice for withholding evidence which could result in the prosecution of the perpetrators of the bombing.

===Prosecution of Robert Chambliss===
On November 14, 1977, Robert Chambliss, then aged 73, stood trial in Birmingham&#x27;s Jefferson County Courthouse. Chambliss had been indicted by a grand jury on September 24, 1977, charged with four counts of murder, for each dead child in the 1963 church bombing. But at a pre-trial hearing on October 18, Judge Wallace Gibson ruled that the defendant would be tried upon one count of murder—that of Carol Denise McNair—and that the remaining three counts of murder would remain, but that he would not be charged in relation to these three deaths.

Before his trial, Chambliss remained free upon a $200,000 bond raised by family and supporters and posted October 18.

Chambliss pleaded not guilty to the charges, insisting that although he had purchased a case of dynamite less than two weeks before the bombing, he had given the dynamite to a Klansman and FBI agent provocateur named Gary Thomas Rowe Jr.

To discredit Chambliss&#x27;s claims that Rowe had committed the bombing, prosecuting attorney William Baxley introduced two law enforcement officers to testify as to Chambliss&#x27;s inconsistent claims of innocence. The first of these witnesses was Tom Cook, a retired Birmingham police officer, who testified on November 15 as to a conversation he had had with Chambliss in 1975. Cook testified that Chambliss had acknowledged his guilt regarding his 1963 arrest for possession of dynamite, but that he (Chambliss) was insistent he had given the dynamite to Rowe before the bombing. Following Cook&#x27;s testimony, Baxley introduced police sergeant Ernie Cantrell. He testified that Chambliss had visited his headquarters in 1976 and that he had attempted to affix the blame for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing upon an altogether different member of the KKK. Cantrell also stated that Chambliss had boasted of his knowledge of how to construct a &quot;drip-method bomb&quot; using a fishing float and a leaking bucket of water. (Upon cross-examination by defense attorney Art Hanes Jr., Cantrell conceded that Chambliss had emphatically denied bombing the church.)

One individual who went to the scene to help search for survivors, Charles Vann, later recollected that he had observed a solitary white man whom he recognized as Robert Edward Chambliss (a known member of the Ku Klux Klan) standing alone and motionless at a barricade. According to Vann&#x27;s later testimony, Chambliss was standing &quot;looking down toward the church, like a firebug watching his fire&quot;.

One of the key witnesses to testify on behalf of the prosecution was the Reverend Elizabeth Cobbs, Chambliss&#x27;s niece. Reverend Cobbs stated that her uncle had repeatedly informed her he had been engaged in what he referred to as a &quot;one-man battle&quot; against blacks since the 1940s. Moreover, Cobbs testified on November 16 that, on the day before the bombing, Chambliss had told her that he had in his possession enough dynamite to &quot;flatten half of Birmingham&quot;. Cobbs also testified that approximately one week after the bombing, she had observed Chambliss watching a news report relating to the four girls killed in the bombing. According to Cobbs, Chambliss had said: &quot;It [the bomb] wasn&#x27;t meant to hurt anybody ... it didn&#x27;t go off when it was supposed to.&quot; Another witness to testify was William Jackson, who testified as to his joining the KKK in 1963 and becoming acquainted with Chambliss shortly thereafter. Jackson testified that Chambliss had expressed frustration that the Klan was &quot;dragging its feet&quot; on the issue of racial integration, and said he was eager to form a splinter group more dedicated to resistance.

In his closing argument before the jury on November 17, Baxley acknowledged that Chambliss was not the sole perpetrator of the bombing. He expressed regret that the state was unable to request the death penalty in this case, as the death penalty in effect in the state in 1963 had been repealed. The current state death penalty law applied only to crimes committed after its passage. Baxley noted that the day of the closing argument fell upon what would have been Carol Denise McNair&#x27;s 26th birthday and that she would have likely been a mother by this date. He referred to testimony given by her father, Chris McNair, about the family&#x27;s loss, and requested that the jury return a verdict of guilty.

In his rebuttal closing argument, defense attorney Art Hanes Jr. attacked the evidence presented by the prosecution as being purely circumstantial, adding that, despite the existence of similar circumstantial evidence, Chambliss had not been prosecuted in 1963 of the church bombing. Hanes noted conflicting testimony among several of the 12 witnesses called by the defense to testify as to Chambliss&#x27;s whereabouts on the day of the bombing. A policeman and a neighbor had each testified that Chambliss was at the home of a man named Clarence Dill on that day.

Following the closing arguments, the jury retired to begin their deliberations, which lasted for over six hours and continued into the following day. On November 18, 1977, they found Robert Chambliss guilty of the murder of Carol Denise McNair. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder. At his sentencing, Chambliss stood before the judge and stated: &quot;Judge, your honor, all I can say is God knows I have never killed anybody, never have bombed anything in my life ... I didn&#x27;t bomb that church.&quot;

On the same afternoon that Chambliss&#x27;s guilty verdict was announced, prosecutor Baxley issued a subpoena to Thomas Blanton to appear in court about the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Although Baxley knew he had insufficient evidence to charge Blanton at this stage, he intended the subpoena to frighten Blanton into confessing his involvement and negotiating a plea deal to turn state evidence against his co-conspirators. Blanton, however, hired a lawyer and refused to answer any questions.

Chambliss appealed his conviction, as provided under the law, saying that much of the evidence presented at his trial—including testimony relating to his activities within the KKK—was circumstantial; that the 14-year delay between the crime and his trial violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial; and the prosecution had deliberately used the delay to try to gain an advantage over Chambliss&#x27;s defense attorneys. This appeal was dismissed on May 22, 1979.

Robert Chambliss died in the Lloyd Noland Hospital and Health Center on October 29, 1985, at the age of 81. In the years since his incarceration, Chambliss had been confined to a solitary cell to protect him from attacks by fellow inmates. He had repeatedly proclaimed his innocence, insisting Gary Thomas Rowe Jr. was the actual perpetrator.

==Later prosecutions==
In 1995, ten years after Chambliss died, the FBI reopened their investigation into the church bombing. It was part of a coordinated effort between local, state and federal governments to review cold cases of the civil rights era in the hopes of prosecuting perpetrators. They unsealed 9,000 pieces of evidence previously gathered by the FBI in the 1960s (many of these documents relating to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing had not been made available to DA William Baxley in the 1970s). In May 2000, the FBI publicly announced their findings that the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing had been committed by four members of the KKK splinter group known as the &quot;Cahaba Boys.&quot; The four individuals named in the FBI report were Blanton, Cash, Chambliss, and Cherry. By the time of the announcement, Herman Cash had also died; however, Thomas Blanton and Bobby Cherry were still alive. Both were arrested.

On May 16, 2000, a grand jury in Alabama indicted Thomas Edwin Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry on eight counts each in relation to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Both named individuals were charged with four counts of first-degree murder, and four counts of universal malice. The following day, both men surrendered to police.

The state prosecution had originally intended to try both defendants together; however, the trial of Bobby Cherry was delayed due to the findings of a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation. It concluded that vascular dementia had impaired his mind, therefore making Cherry mentally incompetent to stand trial or assist in his own defense.

On April 10, 2001, Judge James Garrett indefinitely postponed Cherry&#x27;s trial, pending further medical analysis. In January 2002, Judge Garrett ruled Cherry mentally competent to stand trial and set an initial trial date for April 29.

===Thomas Edwin Blanton===
Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. was brought to trial in Birmingham, Alabama, before Judge James Garrett on April 24, 2001. Blanton pleaded not guilty to the charges and chose not to testify on his behalf throughout the trial.

In his opening statement to the jurors, defense attorney John Robbins acknowledged his client&#x27;s affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan and his views on racial segregation. But, he warned the jury: &quot;Just because you don&#x27;t like him, that doesn&#x27;t make him responsible for the bombing.&quot;

The prosecution called a total of seven witnesses to testify in their case against Blanton, including relatives of the victims, John Cross, the former pastor of the 16th Street Baptist Church; an FBI agent named William Fleming, and Mitchell Burns, a former Klansman who had become a paid FBI informant. Burns had secretly recorded several conversations with Blanton in which the latter (Blanton) had gloated when talking about the bombing, and had boasted the police would not catch him when he bombed another church.

The most crucial piece of evidence presented at Blanton&#x27;s trial was an audio recording secretly taped by the FBI in June 1964, in which Blanton was recorded discussing his involvement in the bombing with his wife, who can be heard accusing her husband of conducting an affair with a woman named Waylen Vaughn two nights before the bombing. Although sections of the recording—presented in evidence on April 27—are unintelligible, Blanton can twice be heard mentioning the phrase &quot;plan a bomb&quot; or &quot;plan the bomb&quot;. Most crucially, Blanton can also be heard saying that he was not with Miss Vaughn but, two nights before the bombing, was at a meeting with other Klansmen on a bridge above the Cahaba River. He said: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to have a meeting to plan a bomb.&quot;

In addition to calling attention to flaws in the prosecution&#x27;s case, the defense exposed inconsistencies in the memories of some prosecution witnesses who had testified. Blanton&#x27;s attorneys criticized the validity and quality of the 16 tape recordings introduced as evidence, arguing that the prosecution had edited and spliced the sections of the audio recording that were secretly obtained within Blanton&#x27;s kitchen, reducing the entirety of the tape by 26 minutes. He said that the sections introduced as evidence were of poor audio quality, resulting in the prosecution presenting text transcripts of questionable accuracy to the jury. About the recordings made as Blanton conversed with Burns, Robbins emphasized that Burns had earlier testified that Blanton had never expressly said that he had made or planted the bomb. The defense portrayed the audiotapes introduced into evidence as the statements of &quot;two rednecks driving around, drinking&quot; and making false, ego-inflating claims to one another.

The trial lasted for one week. Seven witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution, and two for the defense. One of the defense witnesses was a retired chef named Eddie Mauldin, who was called to testify to discredit prosecution witnesses&#x27; statements that they had seen Blanton in the vicinity of the church before the bombing. Mauldin testified on April 30 that he had observed two men in a Rambler station wagon adorned with a Confederate flag repeatedly drive past the church immediately before the blast, and that, seconds after the bomb had exploded, the car had &quot;burned rubber&quot; as it drove away. (Thomas Blanton had owned a Chevrolet in 1963; neither Chambliss, Cash nor Cherry had owned such a vehicle.)

Both counsels delivered their closing arguments before the jury on May 1. In his closing argument, prosecuting attorney and future U.S. Senator Doug Jones said that although the trial was conducted 38 years after the bombing, it was no less important, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s never too late for the truth to be told ... It&#x27;s never too late for a man to be held accountable for his crimes.&quot; Jones reviewed Blanton&#x27;s extensive history with the Ku Klux Klan, before referring to the audio recordings presented earlier in the trial. Jones repeated the most damning statements Blanton had made in these recordings, before pointing at Blanton and stating: &quot;That is a confession out of this man&#x27;s mouth.&quot;

Defense attorney John Robbins reminded the jury in his closing argument that his client was an admitted segregationist and a &quot;loudmouth&quot;, but that was all that could be proven. He said this past was not the evidence upon which they should return their verdicts. Stressing that Blanton should not be judged for his beliefs, Robbins again vehemently criticized the validity and poor quality of the audio recordings presented, and the selectivity of the sections which had been introduced into evidence. Robbins also attempted to show that the testimony of FBI agent William Fleming, who had earlier testified as to a government witness claiming he had seen Blanton in the vicinity of the church shortly before the bombing, could have been mistaken.

The jury deliberated for two and a half hours before returning with a verdict finding Thomas Edwin Blanton guilty of four counts of first-degree murder. When asked by the judge whether he had anything to say before sentence was imposed, Blanton said: &quot;I guess the Lord will settle it on Judgment Day.&quot;

Blanton was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was incarcerated at the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville, Alabama. Blanton was confined in a one-man cell under tight security. He seldom spoke of his involvement in the bombing, shunned social activity and rarely received visitors.

His first parole hearing was held on August 3, 2016. Relatives of the slain girls, prosecutor Doug Jones, Alabama Chief Deputy Attorney General Alice Martin, and Jefferson County district attorney Brandon Falls each spoke at the hearing to oppose Blanton&#x27;s parole. Martin said: &quot;The cold-blooded callousness of this hate crime has not diminished by the passage of time.&quot; The Board of Pardons and Paroles debated for less than 90 seconds before denying parole to Blanton.

Blanton died in prison from unspecified causes on June 26, 2020.

===Bobby Frank Cherry===
Bobby Frank Cherry was tried in Birmingham, Alabama, before Judge James Garrett, on May 6, 2002. Cherry pleaded not guilty to the charges and did not testify on his own behalf during the trial.

In his opening statement for the prosecution, Don Cochran presented his case: that the evidence would show that Cherry had participated in a conspiracy to commit the bombing and conceal evidence linking him to the crime and that he had later gloated over the deaths of the victims. Cochran also added that although the evidence to be presented would not conclusively show that Cherry had personally planted or ignited the bomb, the combined evidence would illustrate that he had aided and abetted in the commission of the act.

Cherry&#x27;s defense attorney, Mickey Johnson, protested his client&#x27;s innocence, citing that much of the evidence presented was circumstantial. He also noted that Cherry had initially been linked to the bombing by the FBI via an informant who had claimed, fifteen months after the bombing, that she had seen Cherry place the bomb at the church shortly before the bombing. Johnson warned the jurors they would have to distinguish between evidence and proof.

Following the opening statements, the prosecution began presenting witnesses. Crucial testimony at Cherry&#x27;s trial was delivered by his former wife, Willadean Brogdon, who had married Cherry in 1970. Brogdon testified on May 16 that Cherry had boasted to her that he had been the individual who planted the bomb beneath the steps to the church, then returned hours later to light the fuse to the dynamite. Brogdon also testified that Cherry had told her of his regret that children had died in the bombing, before adding his satisfaction that they would never reproduce. Although the credibility of Brogdon&#x27;s testimony was called into dispute at the trial, forensic experts conceded that, although her account of the planting of the bombing differed from that which had been discussed in the previous perpetrators&#x27; trials, Brogdon&#x27;s recollection of Cherry&#x27;s account of the planting and subsequent lighting of the bomb could explain why no conclusive remnants of a timing device were discovered after the bombing. (A fishing float attached to a section of wire, which may have been part of a timing device, was found from the explosion crater following the bombing. One of several vehicles severely damaged in the explosion was found to have carried fishing tackle.)

Barbara Ann Cross also testified for the prosecution. She is the daughter of the Reverend John Cross and was aged 13 in 1963. Cross had attended the same Sunday School class as the four victims on the day of the bombing and was slightly wounded in the attack. On May 15, Cross testified that prior to the explosion, she and the four girls killed had each attended a Youth Day Sunday School lesson in which the theme taught was how to react to a physical injustice. Cross testified that each girl present had been taught to contemplate how Jesus would react to affliction or injustice, and they were asked to learn to consider, &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot; Cross testified that she would usually have accompanied her friends into the basement lounge to change into robes for the forthcoming sermon, but she had been given an assignment. Shortly thereafter, she had heard &quot;the most horrible noise&quot;, before being struck on the head by debris.

Throughout the trial, Cherry&#x27;s defense attorney, Mickey Johnson, repeatedly observed that many of the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses were either circumstantial or &quot;inherently unreliable&quot;. Many of the same audiotapes presented in Blanton&#x27;s trial were also introduced into evidence in the trial of Bobby Cherry. A key point contested as to the validity of the audiotapes being introduced into evidence, outside the hearing of the jury, was the fact that Cherry had no grounds to contest the introduction of the tapes into evidence, as, under the Fourth Amendment, neither his home or property had been subject to discreet recording by the FBI. Don Cochran disputed this position, arguing that Alabama law provides for &quot;conspiracies to conceal evidence&quot; to be proven by both inference and circumstantial evidence. In spite of a rebuttal argument by the defense, Judge Garrett ruled that some sections were too prejudicial, but also that portions of some audio recordings could be introduced as evidence. Through these rulings, Mitchell Burns was called to testify on behalf of the prosecution. His testimony was restricted to the areas of the recordings permitted into evidence.
On May 21, 2002, both prosecution and defense attorneys delivered their closing arguments to the jury. In his closing argument for the prosecution, Don Cochran said the victims&#x27; &quot;Youth Sunday [sermon] never happened ... because it was destroyed by this defendant&#x27;s hate.&quot; Cochran outlined Cherry&#x27;s extensive record of racial violence dating back to the 1950s, and noted that he had experience and training in constructing and installing bombs from his service as a Marine demolition expert. Cochran also reminded the jury of a secretly obtained FBI recording, which had earlier been introduced into evidence, in which Cherry had told his first wife, Jean, that he and other Klansmen had constructed the bomb within the premises of business the Friday before the bombing. He said that Cherry had signed an affidavit in the presence of the FBI on October 9, 1963, confirming that he, Chambliss, and Blanton were at these premises on this date.

In the closing argument for the defense, attorney Mickey Johnson argued that Cherry had nothing to do with the bombing, and reminded the jurors that his client was not on trial for his beliefs, stating: &quot;It seems like more time has been spent here throwing around the n-word than proving what happened in September 1963.&quot; Johnson stated that there was no hard evidence linking Cherry to the bombing, but only evidence attesting to his racist beliefs dating from that era, adding that the family members who had testified against him were all estranged and therefore should be considered unreliable witnesses. Johnson urged the jury against convicting his client by association.

Following these closing arguments, the jury retired to consider their verdicts. These deliberations continued until the following day.

On the afternoon of May 22, after the jury had deliberated for almost seven hours, the forewoman announced they had reached their verdicts: Bobby Frank Cherry was convicted of four counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Cherry remained stoic as the sentence was read aloud. Relatives of the four victims openly wept in relief.

When asked by the judge whether he had anything to say before sentence was imposed, Cherry motioned to the prosecutors and stated: &quot;This whole bunch lied through this thing [the trial]. I told the truth. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m going to jail for nothing. I haven&#x27;t done anything!&quot;

Bobby Frank Cherry died of cancer on November 18, 2004, at age 74, while incarcerated at the Kilby Correctional Facility.

Following the convictions of Blanton and Cherry, Alabama&#x27;s former Attorney General, William Baxley, expressed his frustration that he had never been informed of the existence of the FBI audio recordings before they were introduced in the 2001 and 2002 trials. Baxley acknowledged that typical juries in 1960s Alabama would have likely leaned in favor of both defendants, even if these recordings had been presented as evidence, but said that he could have prosecuted Thomas Blanton and Bobby Cherry in 1977 if he had been granted access to these tapes. (A 1980 Justice Department report concluded that J. Edgar Hoover had blocked the prosecution of the four bombing suspects in 1965, and he officially closed the FBI&#x27;s investigation in 1968.)

==Possible fifth conspirator==
Although both Blanton and Cherry denied their involvement in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, until his death in 1985, Robert Chambliss repeatedly insisted that the bombing had been committed by Gary Thomas Rowe Jr. Rowe had been encouraged to join the Klan by acquaintances in 1960. He became a paid FBI informant in 1961. In this role, Rowe acted as an agent provocateur between 1961 and 1965. Although informative to the FBI, Rowe actively participated in violence against both black and white civil rights activists. By Rowe&#x27;s own later admission, while serving as an FBI informant, he had shot and killed an unidentified black man and had been an accessory to the murder of Viola Liuzzo.

Investigative records show that Rowe had twice failed polygraph tests when questioned as to his possible involvement in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and two separate, non-fatal explosions. These polygraph results had convinced some FBI agents of Rowe&#x27;s culpability in the bombing. Prosecutors at Chambliss&#x27;s 1977 trial had initially intended to call Rowe as a witness; however, DA William Baxley had chosen not to call Rowe as a witness after being informed of the results of these polygraph tests.

Although never formally named as one of the conspirators by the FBI, Rowe&#x27;s record of deception on the polygraph tests leaves open the possibility that Chambliss&#x27;s claims may have held a degree of truth. Nonetheless, a 1979 investigation cleared Rowe of any involvement in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.

==Aftermath==
* Following the bombing, the 16th Street Baptist Church remained closed for over eight months, as assessments and, later, repairs were conducted upon the property. Both the church and the bereaved families received an estimated $23,000 in cash donations from members of the public. Gifts totalling over $186,000 were donated from around the world. The church reopened to members of the public on June 7, 1964, and continues to remain an active place of worship today, with an average weekly attendance of nearly 2,000 worshippers. , the pastor of the church is the Reverend Arthur Price Jr.
* The most seriously injured survivor of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, Sarah Jean Collins, remained hospitalized for more than two months following the bombing. Collins&#x27; injuries were so extensive that medical personnel did initially fear she would lose the sight in both eyes, although, by October, they were able to inform Collins she would regain the sight in her left eye. When asked her feelings towards the bombers on October 15, 1963, Collins first thanked those who had cared for her and sent messages of condolence, flowers and toys, then said: &quot;As for the bomber, people are praying for him. We wonder what he would be thinking today if he had children ... He will face God. We turn this problem over to God because no one else can solve Birmingham&#x27;s problems. We leave it up to God to solve them.&quot;
* Charles Morgan Jr., the young white lawyer who had delivered an impassioned speech on September 16, 1963, deploring the tolerance and complacency of much of the white population of Birmingham towards the suppression and intimidation of blacks—thereby contributing to the climate of hatred in the city—himself received death threats directed against him and his family in the days following his speech. Within three months, Morgan and his family were forced to flee Birmingham.
* James Bevel, a prominent figure within the Civil Rights Movement and organizer of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was galvanized to create what became known as the Alabama Project for Voting Rights as a direct result of the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing. Following the bombing, Bevel and his then-wife, Diane, relocated to Alabama, where they tirelessly worked upon the Alabama Project for Voting Rights, which aimed to extend full voting rights for all eligible citizens of Alabama regardless of race. This initiative subsequently contributed to the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches, which themselves resulted in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, thus prohibiting any form of racial discrimination within the process of voting.
* Within the 16th Street Baptist Church, there still stands the &quot;Wales Window of Alabama&quot;. Sculpted by Carmarthenshire-based artist John Petts, who had initiated a campaign in Wales to raise money to fund a replacement stained-glass window which had been destroyed in the bombing. Petts had opted to construct a stained-glass image of a Black Christ to replace one of the windows destroyed in the bombing.
* Within two days of the church bombing, Petts had contacted then-pastor of the church, the Reverend John Cross, announcing he had launched a fundraising campaign to create this artwork via an appeal conducted through the &quot;Western Mail,&quot; requesting funds from the Welsh public to pay for the construction of the structure in Wales, and its delivery and installation at the 16th Street Baptist Church.
* John Petts died in 1991 at the age of 77. In a 1987 interview focusing upon his recollections of the bombing, Petts recollected: &quot;Naturally, as a father, I was horrified by the deaths of those children.&quot; Petts then elaborated that the inspiration for the stained-glass image was a verse from the Gospel of Matthew: &quot;Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.&quot; The &quot;Wales Window of Alabama&quot; bears the inscription, &quot;Given by The People of Wales&quot;.
* On the 27th anniversary of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, a state historic marker was unveiled at Greenwood Cemetery, the final resting place of three of the four victims of the bombing (Carole Robertson&#x27;s body had been reburied in Greenwood Cemetery in 1974, following the death of her father). Several dozen people were present at the unveiling, presided over by state Senator Roger Bedford. At the service, the four girls were described as martyrs who &quot;died so freedom could live&quot;.
* Herman Frank Cash died of cancer in February 1994. He was never charged with his alleged involvement in the bombing and did maintain his innocence. Although Cash is known to have passed a polygraph test in which he was questioned as to his potential involvement in the bombing, the FBI had concluded in May 1965 that Cash was one of the four conspirators. Cash is interred at Northview Cemetery in Polk County, Georgia.
* The Reverend John Cross, who had been the pastor of the 16th Street Baptist Church at the time of the 1963 bombing, died of natural causes on November 15, 2007. He was 82 years old. The Reverend Cross is interred at Hillandale Memorial Gardens in DeKalb County, Georgia.
* Future Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was eight years old at the time of the bombing and both a classmate and friend of Carol Denise McNair. On the day of the bombing, Rice was at her father&#x27;s church, located a few blocks from the 16th Street Baptist Church. In 2004, Rice recalled her memories of the bombing: I remembered the bombing of that Sunday School at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963. I did not see it happen, but I heard it happen and I felt it happen, just a few blocks away at my father&#x27;s church. It is a sound that I will never forget, that will forever reverberate in my ears. That bomb took the lives of four young girls, including my friend and playmate [Carol] Denise McNair. The crime was calculated, not random. It was meant to suck the hope out of young lives, bury their aspirations, and ensure that old fears would be propelled forward into the next generation.
* On May 24, 2013, President Barack Obama awarded a posthumous Congressional Gold Medal to the four girls killed in the 1963 Birmingham Church Bombing. This medal was awarded through signing into effect Public Law 113–11; a bill which awarded one Congressional Gold Medal to be created in recognition of the fact the girls&#x27; deaths served as a major catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement, and invigorated a momentum ensuring the signing into passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The gold medal was presented to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute to display or loan to other museums.
==Media and memorials==
===Music===
* The song &quot;Birmingham Sunday&quot; is directly inspired by the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Written in 1964 by Richard Fariña and recorded by Fariña&#x27;s sister-in-law, Joan Baez, the song was included on Baez&#x27;s 1964 album &quot;Joan Baez/5&quot;. The song would also be covered by Rhiannon Giddens, and is included on her 2017 album &quot;Freedom Highway&quot;.
* Nina Simone&#x27;s 1964 civil rights anthem &quot;Mississippi Goddam&quot; is partially inspired by the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. The lyric &quot;Alabama&#x27;s got me so upset&quot; refers to this incident.
* Jazz musician John Coltrane&#x27;s 1964 album &quot;Live at Birdland&quot; includes the track &quot;Alabama&quot;, recorded two months after the bombing. This song was written as a direct musical tribute to the victims of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.
* African-American composer Adolphus Hailstork&#x27;s 1982 work for wind ensemble titled &quot;American Guernica&quot; was composed in memory of the victims of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.

===Books (fiction)===
* Christopher Paul Curtis&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;The Watsons Go to Birmingham – 1963&quot; conveys the events of the bombing. This fictional account of the bombing was later converted into a movie.
* The 2001 novel &quot;Bombingham&quot;, written by Anthony Grooms, is set in Birmingham in 1963. This novel portrays a fictional account of the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church and the shootings of Virgil Ware and Johnny Robinson.
* The American Girl book &quot;No Ordinary Sound&quot;, set in 1963 and featuring the character of Melody Ellison, has the bombing as a major plot point.

===In sculpture and symbolism===
* Welsh craftsman and artist John Petts was inspired to construct and deliver the iconic stained-glass &quot;Wales Window of Alabama&quot; to the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1965. The &quot;Wales Window of Alabama&quot; is a large stained-glass edifice depicting a black Jesus, with arms outstretched, reminiscent of the Crucifixion of Jesus. Erected at the church in 1965, the &quot;Wales Window of Alabama&quot; stands over the front door of the sanctuary.
* The American sculptor John Henry Waddell has created a memorial symbolizing those killed in the bombing. Entitled &quot;That Which Might Have Been: Birmingham 1963&quot;, the sculpture—depicting four adult women in differing postures—was created over a period of 15 months. The four women in the sculpture are each depicted in symbolic terms; representing the four victims of the bombing, had they been allowed to mature to womanhood. The sculpture was originally displayed at the First Unitarian Universalist Church in Phoenix in 1969. A second casting of the sculpture was intended for display in Birmingham; however, due to controversy over the nudity of the women depicted in the sculpture, this second casting is now on display at the George Washington Carver Museum.
* The names of the four girls killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing are engraved upon the Civil Rights Memorial. Erected in Montgomery, Alabama in 1989. The Civil Rights Memorial is an inverted, conical granite fountain and is dedicated to 41 people who died in the struggle for the equal rights and integrated treatment of all people between the years 1954 and 1968. The names of the 41 individuals themselves are chronologically engrained upon the surface of this fountain. Creator Maya Lin has described this sculpture as a &quot;contemplative area; a place to remember the Civil Rights Movement, to honour those killed during the struggle, to appreciate how far the country has come in its quest for equality&quot;.
* The &quot;Four Spirits&quot; sculpture was unveiled at Birmingham&#x27;s Kelly Ingram Park in September 2013 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bombing. Crafted in Berkeley, California by Birmingham-born sculptor Elizabeth MacQueen and designed as a memorial to the four children killed on September 15, 1963, the bronze and steel life-size sculpture depicts the four girls in preparation for the church sermon at the 16th Street Baptist Church in the moments immediately before the explosion. The youngest girl killed in the explosion (Carol Denise McNair) is depicted releasing six doves into the air as she stands tiptoed and barefooted upon a bench as another barefooted girl (Addie Mae Collins) is depicted kneeling upon the bench, affixing a dress sash to McNair; a third girl (Cynthia Wesley) is sat upon the bench alongside McNair and Collins with a Bible in her lap. The fourth girl (Carole Robertson) is depicted standing and smiling as she motions the other three girls to attend their church sermon.
* At the base of the sculpture is an inscription of the title of the sermon the four girls were to attend before the bombing—&quot;A Love That Forgives&quot;. Oval photographs and brief biographies of the four girls killed in the explosion, the most seriously injured survivor (Sarah Collins), and the two teenage boys who were shot to death later that day also adorn the base of the sculpture. More than 1,000 people were present at the unveiling of the memorial, including survivors of the bombing, friends of the victims and the parents of Denise McNair, Johnny Robinson and Virgil Ware. Among those to speak at the unveiling was the Reverend Joseph Lowery, who informed those present: &quot;Don&#x27;t let anybody tell you these children died in vain. We wouldn&#x27;t be here right now, had they not gone home before our eyes.&quot;
