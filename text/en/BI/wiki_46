<text>The Lowell Spinners were a baseball team based in Lowell, Massachusetts. From 1996 to 2020, they were members of Minor League Baseball&#x27;s New York–Penn League (NYPL) as the Class A Short Season affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. With Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, Lowell was not selected to continue in affiliated baseball.

The team was founded in 1996, after the Elmira Pioneers moved to Lowell. For the 1996 and 1997 seasons, the Spinners played at Stoklosa Alumni Field; from 1998 onward, they played at Edward A. LeLacheur Park.

==History==
Lowell&#x27;s heritage in organized baseball dates to 1877, when the city hosted two teams. The 1877 Lowell team played in the League Alliance and the Lowell Ladies Men were members of the 1877 New England Association. Lowell was a frequent member of the Class B New England League, but had not fielded a team in minor league baseball since 1947, when the nearby Lawrence Millionaires franchise transferred to Lowell on July 15.

After Clyde Smoll Jr. (who bought the Elmira team in 1986 and was the son of former major league pitcher Clyde Smoll) brought the team to Lowell in 1996, Drew Weber was the team owner from 1997 until June 2016, when the franchise was purchased by Dave Heller.

The Spinners set a minor-league record in the 2000 season, as they sold every home ticket for every home game. This began a streak of sold-out home games. The streak was broken on August 30, 2010, at 413 games.
On August 21, 2003, the Spinners sponsored a Jack Kerouac bobblehead giveaway. Kerouac was a Lowell native, and played football for Lowell High School. The bobblehead was accepted by Cooperstown in 2005, the first time a literary icon was accepted there. The bobbleheads were so popular that many more were made than originally intended, raised $10,000 for the Jack Kerouac Scholarship Fund. The enshrinement also made media headlines as far away as Los Angeles.

The giveaway was repeated on August 7, 2012, when the film adaptation of &quot;On the Road&quot; was released. The dolls had a bobble head as well as a &quot;bobble arm.&quot; The bobbleheads were also available online for ordering, and as the game was sponsored by the UMass Lowell English Department, their departmental scholarships received the proceeds from the online orders. A third Kerouac bobblehead, featuring Kerouac in his Lowell High football uniform, was given out on July 25, 2013.

In 2005, the Spinners created the &quot;Yankees Elimination Program.&quot; They offered to pay for the uniforms to all Little Leagues and youth softball teams in New England so that they would change all teams named &quot;Yankees&quot; into &quot;Spinners.” Over the next five years, 150 teams in New England made the switch. The Spinners also invited the youth teams to play at LaLecheur Park, and assisted in other fundraising initiative for those teams. In 2010, the program was limited to 75 teams on a first-come, first-served basis, and it was estimated that over $70,000 had been donated to youth baseball and softball programs through the initiative. Spinners VP and GM Tim Bawmann said,“The Yankees Elimination Promotion was originally built as a fun promotion in response to parents&#x27; stories of children losing interest in the game after facing taunts simply for playing in a Yankees uniform.”

On September 1, 2008, the Spinners reached the New York–Penn League playoffs for the first time, capturing the Stedler Division title. They were defeated in the playoffs by the Batavia Muckdogs. The Spinners reached the playoffs again in 2009, but lost to the Staten Island Yankees.

In October 2014, the Red Sox agreed to extend their player development contract with the Spinners for two more years through the 2016 season. In November 2015, the contract was extended again through the 2018 season.

In the 2016 season, the Spinners ended with a franchise-best record of 47 wins, and tied their record for home wins (25). Right fielder Tyler Hill won the NYPL batting title, and he and third baseman Bobby Dalbec became the first Spinners players to win Player of the Month awards. The Spinners won the Stedler Division title, but were swept by the Hudson Valley Renegades in the semifinals, 2–0. Pitching prospect Jason Groome made his first start for the team in the playoffs, after being promoted from the Gulf Coast League Red Sox.

In 2019, the Spinners finished first in their division, then defeated the Batavia Muckdogs (2 games to 1) in the semifinals, to advance to the league championship series against the Brooklyn Cyclones. The Spinners were defeated in the finals (2 games to 1), with Brooklyn winning the deciding third game of the series by a 4–3 score. As with all minor league teams, the Spinners did not play during 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The mascots of the Spinners were Canaligator, Allie-Gator, and Millie-Gator. They were introduced on January 19, 1996, July 8, 1999, and Opening Day 2006, respectively.

===2021 restructuring of Minor League Baseball===
After the 2020 season, Major League Baseball (MLB) proposed dramatic changes to Minor League Baseball (MiLB) that would take effect at the end of the 2020 season, following expiration of the agreement governing the MLB–MiLB relationship. MLB&#x27;s proposal included reducing the number of minor league teams from 160 to 120—the Spinners were included on the list of teams that could be eliminated under the proposal.
On December 9, 2020, the Red Sox announced that they were dropping the Spinners as an affiliate, as &quot;a reduction to 120 teams has been proposed as the standard beginning in 2021.&quot; Red Sox president Sam Kennedy stated that the Red Sox were &quot;committed to maintaining the 24-year-long tradition of baseball in the Lowell community.” Spinners management, local government officials, and the Red Sox committed to exploring options to keep baseball in Lowell for 2021. However, at the time the minor league season began in early May 2021, no actions or plans had been announced.

==Broadcasting==
Spinners games were broadcast on Lowell talk station WCAP. For the 2007 season they were on WLLH, another Lowell AM radio station, which at the time was an ESPN Radio affiliate. The games returned to WCAP the next season.

<text>Bennett Metcalfe (October 31, 1919 – October 14, 2003) was a Canadian journalist and first chairman of Greenpeace, which was founded in 1971.

Ben Metcalfe was born in Winnipeg. Later he moved to the United Kingdom and at the age of 16 joined the Royal Air Force. He was posted in India and North Africa. After World War II he worked as a journalist in France. He moved back to Canada in 1951, living in Winnipeg, West Vancouver, and Shawnigan Lake. He worked as a journalist, editor, and freelance correspondent for Winnipeg Free Press, the Province in Vancouver and other publications. He also started a public relations company with his second wife Dorothy.

In 1971 he joined the crew member of the Greenpeace boat sailing to protest against U.S. army nuclear bomb test near Amchitka island. When the Greenpeace Foundation was established, Metcalfe became its first chairman. He recognized the importance of a media campaign as a tool to gain support for environmental issues. He left his post when Greenpeace changed focus from nuclear weapons to fighting against whaling and seal hunting.

He is the author of a biography of Roderick Langmere Haig-Brown:

Metcalfe, E. Bennett (1985). &quot;A man of some importance : the life of Roderick Langmere Haig-Brown&quot; Published by James W. Wood, Vancouver. , .

Metcalfe died of a heart attack at age 83. He had three daughters Michelle, Charlotte, and Sophie; and sons Christopher (1958-1980), and Michael (1956-2002)

<doc id="346992" wikidata="Q3527205" url="?curid=346992" title="Dimension theorem for vector spaces">
<text>In mathematics, the dimension theorem for vector spaces states that all bases of a vector space have equally many elements. This number of elements may be finite or infinite (in the latter case, it is a cardinal number), and defines the dimension of the vector space.

Formally, the dimension theorem for vector spaces states that:

As a basis is a generating set that is linearly independent, the dimension theorem is a consequence of the following theorem, which is also useful:

In particular if is finitely generated, then all its bases are finite and have the same number of elements.

While the proof of the existence of a basis for any vector space in the general case requires Zorn&#x27;s lemma and is in fact equivalent to the axiom of choice, the uniqueness of the cardinality of the basis requires only the ultrafilter lemma, which is strictly weaker (the proof given below, however, assumes trichotomy, i.e., that all cardinal numbers are comparable, a statement which is also equivalent to the axiom of choice). The theorem can be generalized to arbitrary -modules for rings having invariant basis number.

In the finitely generated case the proof uses only elementary arguments of algebra, and does not require the axiom of choice nor its weaker variants.

==Proof==
Let be a vector space, be a linearly independent set of elements of , and be a generating set. One has to prove that the cardinality of is not larger than that of .

If is finite, this results from the Steinitz exchange lemma. (Indeed, the Steinitz exchange lemma implies every finite subset of has cardinality not larger than that of , hence is finite with cardinality not larger than that of .) If is finite, a proof based on matrix theory is also possible. 

Assume that is infinite. If is finite, there is nothing to prove. Thus, we may assume that is also infinite. Let us suppose that the cardinality of is larger than that of . We have to prove that this leads to a contradiction. 

By Zorn&#x27;s lemma, every linearly independent set is contained in a maximal linearly independent set . This maximality implies that spans and is therefore a basis (the maximality implies that every element of is linearly dependent from the elements of , and therefore is a linear combination of elements of ). As the cardinality of is greater than or equal to the cardinality of , one may replace with , that is, one may suppose, without loss of generality, that is a basis. 

Thus, every can be written as a finite sum
formula_1
where formula_2 is a finite subset of formula_3 As is infinite, formula_4 has the same cardinality as . Therefore formula_4 has cardinality smaller than that of . So there is some formula_6 which does not appear in any formula_2. The corresponding formula_8 can be expressed as a finite linear combination of formula_9s, which in turn can be expressed as finite linear combination of formula_10s, not involving formula_8. Hence formula_12 is linearly dependent on the other formula_10s, which provides the desired contradiction.

==Kernel extension theorem for vector spaces==
This application of the dimension theorem is sometimes itself called the &quot;dimension theorem&quot;. Let

be a linear transformation. Then

that is, the dimension of &quot;U&quot; is equal to the dimension of the transformation&#x27;s range plus the dimension of the kernel. See rank–nullity theorem for a fuller discussion.

<text>Suspiria is a 1977 Italian supernatural horror film directed by Dario Argento, who co-wrote the screenplay with Daria Nicolodi, partially based on Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s 1845 essay &quot;Suspiria de Profundis&quot;. The film stars Jessica Harper as an American ballet student who transfers to a prestigious European dance academy but realizes, after a series of murders, that the academy is a front for a coven of witches. It also features Stefania Casini, Flavio Bucci, Miguel Bosé, Alida Valli, Udo Kier, and Joan Bennett, in her final film role.

The film is the first of the trilogy Argento refers to as &quot;The Three Mothers&quot;, which also comprises &quot;Inferno&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Mother of Tears&quot; (2007). &quot;Suspiria&quot; has received a positive response from critics for its visual and stylistic flair, use of vibrant colors and its score by Argento and the progressive rock band Goblin.

&quot;Suspiria&quot; was nominated for two Saturn Awards: Best Supporting Actress for Bennett in 1978, and Best DVD Classic Film Release in 2002. It is recognized as one of the most influential films in the horror genre and has received acclaim from critics in retrospective reviews. It served as the inspiration for a 2018 film of the same title, directed by Luca Guadagnino.

== Plot ==
Suzy Bannion, a young American ballet student, arrives in Freiburg, West Germany, to study at the co-ed Tanz Akademie, a prestigious dance school. She sees another student, Pat Hingle, flee the school in terror. Suzy is refused entry to the school and forced to stay in town overnight. Pat takes refuge at a friend&#x27;s apartment and tells her that something sinister happened at the school. Pat is ambushed by a shadowy figure who stabs her repeatedly before hanging her with a noose by throwing her through the apartment building&#x27;s skylight. Pat&#x27;s friend is also killed after being impaled by a falling shard of glass while trying to alert other tenants to the murder.

Suzy returns to the school the next morning, where she meets Miss Tanner, the head instructor, and Madame Blanc, the deputy headmistress. Tanner introduces Suzy to Pavlos, one of the school&#x27;s servants. She also meets classmates Sara and Olga, her new roommate. Suzy experiences an unsettling encounter with one of the school&#x27;s matrons and Blanc&#x27;s nephew, Albert, before passing out during a dance class. When she regains consciousness, Suzy learns that Olga has thrown her out of her apartment, forcing her to live at the school with Sara in the room next door.

One night, maggots fall from the ceilings of the students&#x27; rooms due to a shipment of spoiled food in the attic, forcing them to sleep in one of the dance studios. During the night, a woman enters the room but is obscured by a curtain hung around the room&#x27;s perimeter. Sara, frightened by her hoarse and labored breathing, recognizes her as the school&#x27;s headmistress, who is supposedly out of town. The next day, the school&#x27;s blind pianist, Daniel, is abruptly fired by Miss Tanner when his German Shepherd bites Albert. Daniel is stalked by an unseen force while walking through a plaza that night; his dog turns on him and viciously rips out his throat.

Sara tells Suzy that she was the one on the intercom who refused her entry the night Pat was murdered. She reveals that Pat was behaving strangely before her death and promises to show Suzy the notes that she left behind. Sara finds that Pat&#x27;s notes are missing and is forced to flee when an unseen assailant enters the room. They pursue her through the school before cornering her in the attic. She escapes through a small window but falls into a pit of razor wire, entangling her before her pursuer kills her by slashing her throat.

The next morning, Tanner tells Suzy that Sara has fled the school. Suspicious, Suzy contacts Sara&#x27;s friend and former psychiatrist, Frank Mandel. He reveals that the school was established in 1895 by Greek émigrée Helena Markos, who was allegedly a witch. Suzy also consults with Professor Milius, a professor of the occult. He reveals that a coven of witches draws its strength and power from its leader, and without a leader, the coven will perish.

Suzy returns to the school to find that everyone has left to attend the Bolshoi Ballet. Recalling a conversation with Sara about footsteps, she follows the sound of them carefully, leading her to Madame Blanc&#x27;s office. Remembering that Pat uttered the words &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;iris&quot; the night that she was killed, Suzy discovers a hidden door that opens by turning a blue iris on a mural in Blanc&#x27;s office. Suzy enters the corridor and finds the academy&#x27;s instructors, led by Madame Blanc, plotting her demise in the form of a human sacrifice. Albert alerts Pavlos to Suzy&#x27;s presence. Suzy hides in an alcove, where she finds Sara&#x27;s disfigured corpse.

Pursued by Pavlos, Suzy retreats to Helena Markos&#x27;s bedroom. Suzy finds Markos sleeping, recognizing her as the headmistress by her labored breathing. She accidentally wakes her by breaking a decorative peacock. Markos renders herself invisible and taunts Suzy before reanimating Sara&#x27;s mutilated corpse to murder her. When flashes of lightning inadvertently reveal Markos&#x27;s silhouette, Suzy impales her through the neck with one of the peacock&#x27;s broken glass quills. Markos&#x27;s death causes Sara&#x27;s corpse to vanish.

Suzy flees as the school starts to implode. Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, Pavlos and the rest of the coven perish without the power of Markos to sustain them. Suzy escapes into the rainy night as the school is consumed by fire.

==Cast==
Director Dario Argento provides the narration in the original Italian version. In the English version, the narration is provided by William Kiehl.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Argento based &quot;Suspiria&quot; in part on Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s essay &quot;Suspiria de Profundis&quot; (1845). Critic Maitland McDonagh notes: &quot;In Argento&#x27;s reading [of the material], the three mothers generate/inhabit a cinematic world informed by Jungian archetypal imagery, each holding sway over a particular city.&quot; Argento said the idea for the film came to him after a trip through several European cities, including Lyon, Prague, and Turin. He became fascinated by the &quot;Magic Triangle&quot;, a point where the countries of France, Germany, and Switzerland meet; this is where Rudolf Steiner, a controversial social reformer and occultist, founded an anthroposophic community. Commenting on witchcraft and the occult, Argento stated: &quot;There&#x27;s very little to joke about. It&#x27;s something that exists.&quot; The title and general concept of &quot;The Three Mothers&quot;—a concept Argento would expand upon in &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;Mother of Tears—&quot;came from De Quincey&#x27;s essay, which was an uncredited inspiration for the film. There is a section in the work entitled &quot;Levana and Our Ladies of Sorrow&quot;. The piece asserts that just as there are three Fates and three Graces, there are three Sorrows: &quot;Mater Lacrymarum, Our Lady of Tears&quot;, &quot;Mater Suspiriorum, Our Lady of Sighs&quot;, and &quot;Mater Tenebrarum, Our Lady of Darkness&quot;.

Daria Nicolodi helped Argento write the screenplay for the film, which combined the occult themes that interested Argento with fairytales that were inspiring to Nicolodi, such as &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, and &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Nicolodi also partially based her contributions to the screenplay on a personal story her grandmother had told her, in which her grandmother had gone to take a piano lesson at an unnamed academy where she believed she encountered black magic. The encounter terrified her grandmother, prompting her to flee. This story, however, was later said by Argento to have been fabricated. Using Nicolodi&#x27;s core ideas, Argento helped co-write the screenplay, which he chose to set at a dance academy in Freiburg im Breisgau, near the German borders with Switzerland and France. The lead character of Suzy Bannion was based on Snow White. Initially, the characters in the film were very young girls—around eight to ten years old—but this was altered when the film&#x27;s producers were hesitant to make a film with all young actors. Additionally, the final sequence of the film was based on a dream Nicolodi had while she was staying in Los Angeles.

=== Casting ===
American actress Jessica Harper was cast in the lead role of American ballet dancer Suzy Bannion, after attending an audition via the William Morris Agency. Argento chose Harper based on her performance in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; (1974). Upon being cast in the film, Harper watched Argento&#x27;s &quot;Four Flies on Grey Velvet&quot; (1971) to better understand the director&#x27;s style. Harper turned down a role in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977) in order to appear in the film.

Argento requested Italian actress Stefania Casini for the supporting role of Sara, a request which she obliged, having been an admirer of his films. Daria Nicolodi had originally planned on playing the role of Sara, but was unable to due to an injury, and Casini was brought in at the last minute. German actor Udo Kier was cast in the minor supporting role of Frank Mandel.

=== Filming ===

The majority of &quot;Suspiria&quot; was shot at De Paoli studios in Rome, where key exterior sets (including the façade of the academy) were constructed. Actress Harper described the film shoot as &quot;very, very focused&quot;, as Argento &quot;knew exactly what he was looking for&quot;. The façade of the academy was replicated on a soundstage from the real-life Whale House in Freiburg. Additional photography took place in Munich, including Daniel&#x27;s death scene in the &quot;Königsplatz&quot; square, as well as the opening scene of the film, which was shot on location at the Munich-Riem Airport (closed in 1992). The scene in which Suzy meets with Dr. Mandel was filmed outside the BMW Headquarters building in Munich.

&quot;Suspiria&quot; is noteworthy for several stylistic flourishes that have become Argento trademarks, particularly the use of set-piece structures that allow the camera to linger on pronounced visual elements. Cinematographer Luciano Tovoli was hired by Argento to shoot the film, based on color film tests he had completed, which Argento felt matched his vision, in part inspired by &quot;Snow White&quot; (1937). The film was shot using anamorphic lenses. The production design and cinematography emphasize vivid primary colors, particularly red, creating a deliberately unrealistic, nightmarish setting, emphasized by the use of imbibition Technicolor prints. Commenting on the film&#x27;s lush colors, Argento said: We were trying to reproduce the colour of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White&quot;; it has been said from the beginning that Technicolor lacked subdued shades, [and] was without nuances—like cut-out cartoons.

The imbibition process, used for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), is much more vivid in its color rendition than emulsion-based release prints, therefore enhancing the nightmarish qualities of the film Argento intended to evoke. It was one of the final feature films to be processed in Technicolor, using the last remaining machine in Rome.

=== Post-production ===
==== Dubbing ====
Nearly all of the actors&#x27; dialogue was dubbed in post-production, a common practice in Italian filmmaking at the time. However, the scene at the academy after the first murder, where the police are investigating, features the original dialogue recorded on set.

==== Musical score ====

The Italian progressive rock band Goblin composed most of the film&#x27;s score in collaboration with Argento himself. Goblin had scored Argento&#x27;s earlier film &quot;Deep Red&quot; as well as several films following &quot;Suspiria&quot;. In the film&#x27;s opening credits, they are referred to as &quot;The Goblins&quot;. Like Ennio Morricone&#x27;s compositions for Sergio Leone, Goblin&#x27;s score for &quot;Suspiria&quot; was created before the film was shot. It has been reused in multiple Hong Kong films, including Yuen Woo-ping&#x27;s martial arts film &quot;Dance of the Drunk Mantis&quot; (1979) and Tsui Hark&#x27;s horror-comedy &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Eat You&quot; (1980).

The main title theme was named as one of the best songs released between 1977 and 1979 in the book &quot;The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present&quot;, compiled by music website Pitchfork. It has been sampled on the Raekwon and Ghostface Killah song &quot;Legal Coke&quot;, from the R. A. G. U. mix tape, by RJD2 for the song &quot;Weather People&quot; by Cage and by Army of the Pharaohs in their song &quot;Swords Drawn&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Suspiria&quot; was released in Italy on 1 February 1977. 20th Century Fox acquired the American distribution rights; due to its violent content, they were hesitant to release &quot;Suspiria&quot;, but eventually premiered the film in July 1977 through a shell company, International Classics. The original American prints were cut by a total of eight minutes in order for the film to pass with an R-rating. Despite initial reservations, the film&#x27;s American release was commercially successful, and proved to be Fox&#x27;s seventh highest-grossing release of the year in theatrical rentals. Of all of Argento&#x27;s films, &quot;Suspiria&quot; was his highest–grossing in the United States.

=== Critical response ===
Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote a mixed review, saying the film had &quot;slender charms, though they will most assuredly be lost on viewers who are squeamish.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Kevin Thomas wrote that the film was &quot;consistently suspenseful and diverting&quot; despite being &quot;marred by stilted, poorly dubbed English dialogue&quot;. John Stark of &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; was critical, writing: &quot;&quot;Suspiria&quot; is mostly gore, with little plot or intrigue.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; expressed similar sentiments, criticizing Harper&#x27;s role to being &quot;reduced to cowering in corners&quot; and &quot;costumed to look much younger than her years&quot;; while praising Argento&#x27;s &quot;visually stylish&quot; direction, he felt that &quot;Suspiria&quot; was inferior to his directorial debut &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot; (1970) and &quot;plays like a weak imitation of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973)&quot;.

Like Siskel, Bruce McCabe of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; likened the film to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (1977), ultimately deeming it &quot;a fitful, uneven piece of work too often more uncontrolled than the hysteria it&#x27;s trying to create.&quot; Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; gave a favorable review, claiming that &quot;Argento works so hard for his effects—throwing around shock cuts, colored lights and peculiar camera angles—that it would be impolite not to be a little frightened&quot;. Although J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave a positive review as well, he called it &quot;a movie that makes sense only to the eye&quot;. Bob Keaton of the &quot;Fort Lauderdale News&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;well-crafted plot&quot;, likening elements of it to the works of Edgar Allan Poe, adding: &quot;For the seekers of superficially devilish thrills, &quot;Suspiria&quot; is just the thing.&quot; A review in the &quot;Colorado Springs Gazette&quot; deemed it &quot;a film to experience and for lovers of cinematic suspense... &quot;Suspiria&quot; may prove to be the most harrowing shocker ever filmed.&quot;

==== Retrospective assessment ====
In the years since its release, &quot;Suspiria&quot; has been cited by critics as a cult film. In the book &quot;European Nightmares: Horror Cinema in Europe Since 1945&quot; (2012), the film is noted for being an &quot;exemplar of Eurohorror... it is excessive but here the excess seems to entail a more forceful retardation of a narrative drive, to the extent that the narrative periodically ceases to exist.&quot; &quot;Suspiria&quot; has been praised by film historians and critics for its emphasized employment of color and elaborate set-pieces; film scholar John Kenneth Muir notes that &quot;each and every frame of &quot;Suspiria&quot; is composed with an artistic, remarkable attention to color.&quot;

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;Suspiria&quot; #100 on their list of the 100 greatest films made in the 20th century. Adam Smith of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine awarded the film a perfect score of five out of five. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine also ranked &quot;Suspiria&quot; #312 on their list of the 500 greatest films ever as well as number 45 on their list &#x27;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&#x27;. AllMovie called it &quot;one of the most striking assaults on the senses ever to be committed to celluloid... this unrelenting tale of the supernatural was—and likely still is—the closest a filmmaker has come to capturing a nightmare on film.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Suspiria&quot; #18 on their list of the 25 scariest films ever. A poll of critics of &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked it #3 on their list of the 50 greatest horror films ever. One of the film&#x27;s sequences was ranked at #24 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot; program. IGN ranked it #20 on their list of the 25 best horror films.

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% score based on 61 retrospectively collected reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;The blood pours freely in Argento&#x27;s classic &quot;Suspiria&quot;, a giallo horror as grandiose and glossy as it is gory.&quot; Rotten Tomatoes also ranked it #61 on their list of the top 100 horror movies. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Suspiria&quot; was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in a three-disc set on 11 September 2001. This release, which was a limited edition run restricted to 60,000 units, features a THX-certified video master of the film, with a second disc consisting of a 52-minute documentary and other bonus material; the third disc is a CD consisting of the original film score. This release also includes a 28-page booklet and ten lobby card and poster reproductions. Goblin frontman Claudio Simonetti later formed the heavy-metal band Daemonia; the DVD also contains a video of the band playing a reworking of the &quot;Suspiria&quot; theme. A standard single-disc edition was released by Anchor Bay the following month.

On 19 December 2017, the independent home media distributor Synapse Films released the film for the first time on Blu-ray in the United States in a limited steelbook package. This release also consists of three discs which include a 4K restoration of the feature film, bonus materials, and the original score on a compact disc. A wide-release version not containing the soundtrack CD was released on 13 March 2018. On 19 November 2019, Synapse released their restoration in 4K but without the soundtrack CD nor an accompanying Blu-ray disc.

In Italy, the film received a 4K-remastered Blu-ray release via the Italian distributor Videa in February 2017. It did not use the same 4K restoration as the US Synapse release.

== Legacy ==
Three bands—the Norwegian thrash-metal band Susperia; a pioneering mid-1990s UK gothic rock band, Suspiria; and the witch-house project Mater Suspiria Vision—have named themselves after the film. Several albums have also used the title, including an album by gothic metal band Darkwell, an album by Darkwave band Miranda Sex Garden and &quot;Suspiria de Profundis&quot; by Die Form, which can also be regarded as inspired by Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s work of the same title. The film&#x27;s music has also been imitated and sampled by various artists, including Ministry in the track &quot;Psalm 69&quot; from their album &quot;Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs&quot;, Cage Kennylz on &quot;Weather People&quot; and Atmosphere on &quot;Bird Sings Why the Caged I Know&quot;. The American death metal band Infester included a sample from the film in their song, &quot;Chamber of Reunion&quot;, from their album &quot;To the Depths, In Degradation&quot; (1994). The Houston, Texas-based Two Star Symphony Orchestra included a track titled &quot;Goblin Attack&quot; on their 2004 CD &quot;Danse Macabre: Constant Companion&quot; that features a strings rendition of the &quot;Suspiria&quot; theme; the track&#x27;s title also appears to be a reference to the band Goblin. The 69 Eyes have a song called &quot;Suspiria Snow White&quot; on their album &quot;Back in Blood&quot; (2009). In 1991, the California-based instrumental band Gargamel recorded a version of the &quot;Suspiria&quot; theme featuring dulcimer and tape manipulations amongst their covers of horror film soundtrack compositions.

A section of the soundtrack cues &quot;Markos&quot;, &quot;Witch&quot;, and &quot;Death Valzer&quot; were incorporated into the Australian radiophonic work &quot;What&#x27;s Rangoon to You is Grafton to Me&quot;, conceived and written by radio presenter and author Russell Guy, co-narrated by Guy and former ABC-TV newsreader James Dibble, and co-produced by Guy and Graham Wyatt. It was originally broadcast in 1978 on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;youth&quot; radio station 2JJ aka Double Jay (the Sydney-based AM-band precursor to the current Triple J network).

In books by Simon R. Green, mentions are often made of a &quot;Black Forest Dance Academy&quot; in Germany, a place where witches and Satanists gather, a possible reference to &quot;Suspiria&quot;.

&quot;Suspiria&quot; is featured in the documentary film &quot;Terror in the Aisles&quot; (1984). In the comedy-drama film &quot;Juno&quot; (2007), &quot;Suspiria&quot; is considered by the title character to be the goriest film ever made, until she is shown &quot;The Wizard of Gore&quot; and changes her mind, saying it is actually gorier than &quot;Suspiria&quot;. The film is also mentioned in the episode &quot;The Seminar&quot; of &quot;The Office&quot; (season 7), Kirby Reed&#x27;s horror film collection in the horror film &quot;Scream 4&quot; (2011), and in Ryan Murphy’s &quot;American Horror Story: Hotel&quot; where a character watches &quot;Suspiria&quot; on television.

In March 2020, a new score, featuring members of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard alongside other Melbourne musicians, was performed live with a screening of the film.

During &quot;&quot; 1.2 update, a character &#x27;Sotheby&#x27; received a paid cosmetic item which makes direct reference to the film.

== Related works ==
=== Subsequent films ===
&quot;Suspiria&quot; is the first of a trilogy of films by Argento, referred to as &quot;The Three Mothers&quot;. The trilogy centers around three witches, or &quot;Mothers of Sorrow&quot; who unleash evil from three locations in the world. In &quot;Suspiria&quot;, Helena Marcos is &quot;Mater Suspiriorum&quot; ( Latin: &quot;Mother of Sighs&quot;) in Freiburg. Argento&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;Inferno&quot; focuses on &quot;Mater Tenebrarum&quot; ( Latin: &quot;Mother of Darkness&quot;), in New York City. The final installment in the trilogy, &quot;The Mother of Tears&quot; (2007), focuses on &quot;Mater Lachrymarum&quot; ( Latin: &quot;Mother of Tears&quot;) in Rome.

Film scholar L. Andrew Cooper notes &quot;Aesthetic experience is arguably the ultimate source of &#x27;meaning&#x27; in all of Argento&#x27;s films, but &quot;Suspiria&quot; and the other films of the Three Mothers trilogy...take their emphasis on aesthetics further by self-consciously connecting their irrational worlds to nineteenth-century romanticism and the aestheticism that grew out of it.&quot;

=== Unfilmed remake ===
It was announced through MTV in 2008 that a remake of &quot;Suspiria&quot; was in production, to be directed by David Gordon Green, who directed films such as &quot;Undertow&quot; and &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;. The announcement was met with hostility by some, including Argento himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;riff.is/tv&quot;&gt;Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: &lt;/ref&gt; The film was to be produced by Italian production company First Sun. In August 2008, it was reported that Natalie Portman and Annette Savitch&#x27;s Handsome Charlie Films were set to produce the remake, and that Portman would play the lead role. The project was also announced to be produced by Marco Morabito and Luca Guadagnino. After a period of no news in which it was thought that the remake attempt had failed, Green said in August 2011 that he was still trying to remake the film. It was announced on 15 May 2012 that actress Isabelle Fuhrman would be cast as the lead. Later that year, however, the planned remake was put on hold. In January 2013, Green revealed that it might never happen due to legal issues. In April 2014, Green admitted the remake was too expensive to make during the &quot;found-footage boom&quot;, and thus the film was ultimately not made.

In April 2015, an English-language television series based on the film—along with a series based on Sergio Corbucci&#x27;s &quot;Django&quot; (1966)—was announced as being developed by Atlantique Productions and Cattleya. Both series were set to consist of twelve 50-minute long episodes, with the possibility of multiple seasons.

=== 2018 film ===

In September 2015, Italian director Luca Guadagnino announced at the 72nd Venice Film Festival that he would direct a new version of &quot;Suspiria&quot;, with the intention of using the cast of his film &quot;A Bigger Splash&quot; (Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts, Ralph Fiennes, and Dakota Johnson). In the lead-up to filming, Johnson stated that she was undertaking ballet training to prepare. On 23 November 2015, Guadagnino revealed shooting would begin in August 2016. In October 2016, it was announced that Chloë Grace Moretz would co-star, alongside Johnson and Swinton. The film finished shooting on 10 March 2017 in Berlin. The film was described by Guadagnino as an &quot;homage&quot; to the 1977 film rather than a direct remake. Guadagnino&#x27;s version is set in Berlin circa 1977 (the year in which Argento&#x27;s film was released), with a thematic focus on &quot;the uncompromising force of motherhood&quot;.

<text>Audio equipment refers to devices that reproduce, record, or process sound. This includes microphones, radio receivers, AV receivers, CD players, tape recorders, amplifiers, mixing consoles, effects units, headphones, and speakers.

Audio equipment is widely used in many different scenarios, such as concerts, bars, meeting rooms and the home where there is a need to reproduce, record and enhance sound volume.

Electronic circuits considered a part of audio electronics may also be designed to achieve certain signal processing operations, in order to make particular alterations to the signal while it is in the electrical form. 

Audio signals can be created synthetically through the generation of electric signals from electronic devices. 

Audio electronics were traditionally designed with analog electric circuit techniques until advances in digital technologies were developed. Moreover, digital signals are able to be manipulated by computer software much the same way audio electronic devices would, due to its compatible digital nature. Both analog and digital design formats are still used today, and the use of one or the other largely depends on the application.

<text>In computing, RELAX NG (REgular LAnguage for XML Next Generation) is a schema language for XML—a RELAX NG schema specifies a pattern for the structure and content of an XML document. A RELAX NG schema is itself an XML document but RELAX NG also offers a popular compact, non-XML syntax. Compared to other XML schema languages RELAX NG is considered relatively simple.

It was defined by a committee specification of the OASIS RELAX NG technical committee in 2001 and 2002, based on Murata Makoto&#x27;s RELAX and James Clark&#x27;s TREX, and also by part two of the international standard ISO/IEC 19757: Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL). ISO/IEC 19757-2 was developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 and published in its first version in 2003.

==Schema examples==
Suppose we want to define an extremely simple XML markup scheme for a book: a book is defined as a sequence of one or more pages; each page contains text only. A sample XML document instance might be:
&lt;book&gt;
 &lt;page&gt;This is page one.&lt;/page&gt;
 &lt;page&gt;This is page two.&lt;/page&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;
===XML syntax===
A RELAX NG schema can be written in a nested structure by defining a root element that contains further element definitions, which may themselves contain embedded definitions. A schema for our book in this style, using the full XML syntax, would be written:
&lt;element name=&quot;book&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;oneOrMore&gt;
 &lt;element name=&quot;page&quot;&gt;
 &lt;text/&gt;
 &lt;/element&gt;
 &lt;/oneOrMore&gt;
&lt;/element&gt;
Nested structure becomes unwieldy with many sublevels and cannot define recursive elements, so most complex RELAX NG schemas use references to &quot;named pattern&quot; definitions located separately in the schema. Here, a &quot;flattened schema&quot; defines precisely the same book markup as the previous example:
&lt;grammar xmlns=&quot;http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;start&gt;
 &lt;element name=&quot;book&quot;&gt;
 &lt;oneOrMore&gt;
 &lt;ref name=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/oneOrMore&gt;
 &lt;/element&gt;
 &lt;/start&gt;
 &lt;define name=&quot;page&quot;&gt;
 &lt;element name=&quot;page&quot;&gt;
 &lt;text/&gt;
 &lt;/element&gt;
 &lt;/define&gt;
&lt;/grammar&gt;
===Compact syntax===
RELAX NG compact syntax is a non-XML format inspired by extended Backus–Naur form and regular expressions, designed so that it can be unambiguously translated to its XML counterpart, and back again, with one-to-one correspondence in structure and meaning, in much the same way that Simple Outline XML (SOX) relates to XML. It shares many features with the syntax of DTDs. Here is the compact form of the above schema:
element book {
 element page { text }+


With named patterns, this can be flattened to:
start = element book { page+ }
page = element page { text }
A compact RELAX NG parser will treat these two as the same pattern.

==Comparison with W3C XML Schema==

Although the RELAX NG specification was developed at roughly the same time as the W3C XML Schema specification, the latter was arguably better known and more widely implemented in both open-source and proprietary XML parsers and editors when it became a W3C Recommendation in 2001. Since then, however, RELAX NG support has increasingly found its way into XML software, and its acceptance has been aided by its adoption as a primary schema for popular document-centric markup languages such as DocBook, the TEI Guidelines, OpenDocument, and EPUB.

RELAX NG shares with W3C XML Schema many features that set both apart from traditional DTDs: data typing, regular expression support, namespace support, ability to reference complex definitions.

==Filename extensions==
By informal convention, RELAX NG schemas in the regular syntax are typically named with the filename extension &quot;.rng&quot;. For schemas in the compact syntax, the extension &quot;.rnc&quot; is used.

==Determinism==
Relax NG schemas are not necessarily &quot;deterministic&quot; or &quot;unambiguous&quot;.

==Converting Relax NG to DTD==
Relax NG schemas can be converted to DTDs by applying Trang which can be found at: . The manual for Trang is located at . Note that Trang is unable to convert the OASIS DITA 1.3 schema to DTDs, failing with messages like:

 sorry, combining definitions with combine=&quot;choice&quot; is not supported

<doc id="347008" wikidata="Q936075" url="?curid=347008" title="Samuel Brannan">
<text>Samuel S. Brannan (March 2, 1819 – May 5, 1889) was an American settler, businessman, journalist, and prominent Mormon who founded the &quot;California Star&quot;, the first newspaper in San Francisco, California. He is also considered the first to publicize the California Gold Rush and was California&#x27;s first millionaire. He used the profits from his stores to buy large tracts of real estate. He helped form the first vigilance committee in San Francisco and was disfellowshiped from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) because of his actions within the vigilance committee. Brannan&#x27;s wife divorced him, requiring him to liquidate much of his real estate to pay her half of their shared assets. He died poor and in relative obscurity.

== Early life ==
Brannan was born in Saco, Massachusetts (now Maine), to Thomas and Sara Emery Brannan. In order to escape his abusive father, Brannan moved with his sister (Mary Ann) and her husband (Alexander) to Painesville, Ohio, when he was fourteen years old. It was there that Brannan learned the printer&#x27;s trade. During their journey to Ohio, the trio found themselves listening to two men whom they would later know as Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball. Brannan&#x27;s brother-in-law bought a copy of the Book of Mormon from these street corner missionaries. In the neighboring town of Kirtland, Ohio, Brannan, Alexander, and Mary Ann all joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1842. After his father&#x27;s death, Brannan inherited a decent sum of money, bought himself out of his last year of his apprenticeship, and invested the rest in a patch of land near Cleveland. Soon after making his investment, the market crashed and his land became worthless. He made a quick visit to Maine in order to see his ailing mother and then made his way to New Orleans where his brother Thomas was living. The Brannan brothers bought a press and type with what little money they had, but Thomas was taken by yellow fever shortly thereafter. After this tragedy, Brannan made his way back to the North, stopping in Indianapolis to promote a paper which ultimately failed, before he returned to Painesville.

===Early Service in the Church===
Once Brannan had returned to his sister&#x27;s home, he renewed his religious convictions in the church and was called by the apostle Wilford Woodruff to serve a local mission in Ohio. Before being called as a missionary he had married Harriet (&quot;Hattie&quot;) Hatch and they were expecting their first child. His mission ended early when he caught malaria and had to return home for his health. Once he had sufficiently recovered he was again called to help the church, but this time as a printer in Connecticut working alongside the apostle William Smith. While waiting in Connecticut to meet up with Smith, Brannan fell in love with Ann Eliza Corwin, whose mother took care of the visitors in the local boarding house. Brannan planned to marry her and separate from his first wife. They were eventually married although it was said that Brannan had never officially divorced his first wife. They had four children together.

From Connecticut they went to New York City, New York, in 1844, and started to print &quot;The Prophet&quot; (later &quot;The New-York Messenger&quot;), a Latter Day Saint newspaper. Shortly after the paper began, news spread that the prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were murdered and Brigham Young had taken over the position as prophet. Brannan worked closely with Smith&#x27;s blood brother William and advocated for William to take his &quot;rightful place&quot; as prophet. After word of Brannan and Smith&#x27;s opposition reached Nauvoo, both men were disfellowshipped from the church. A year later, Brannan went to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, leaders of the LDS Church, pleading for reinstatement as a member of the church; it was granted in May 1845.

== Travel to California ==

After the assassination of their leader, the Prophet Joseph Smith, rising hostilities, attacks on their homes and religious persecution, in the east, the Mormons decided to relocate their center from Nauvoo, Illinois, to the western region outside of the United States border. The plans for the large exodus began and Mormon leadership moved westward, leaving Brannan the highest ranking religious leader in New York. As such, he was faced with the large responsibility of evacuating the eastern Mormons to California. Brannan chartered the ship &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and persuaded the Mormons of New York to join the expedition to California. The &quot;Brooklyn&quot; set sail for upper California via Cape Horn in January 1846. Brannan was in charge of the expedition and the highest presiding religious leader on the ship. He brought along an antiquated printing press and a complete flour mill to make colonization easier. While the living conditions aboard the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; were strenuous for many, Brannan lived lavishly in the ship&#x27;s officers&#x27; quarters. The ship stopped on June 20, 1846, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to resupply and be inspected by Commodore Stockton. Brannan expected the inspection to go badly but instead Commodore Stockton spoke to Brannan about the United States&#x27; planned assault of the Mexicans at Monterey. This information along with Commodore Stockton&#x27;s quiet encouragement led Samuel Brannan to the idea of taking the Mexican port town of Yerba Buena. Brannan&#x27;s dreams of religious freedom and success were underway and after leaving Hawaii, the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; changed routes, landing on July 31, 1846, at Yerba Buena. Upon arrival they were met by Commander John B. Montgomery and the &quot;Portsmouth&quot;, who had taken Yerba Buena only a few days before, much to Brannan&#x27;s dismay. The Mormons began settling into the area (present-day San Francisco) and tripled the population of the pueblo.

== California career ==
After settling in Yerba Buena, Brannan consulted with natives who were familiar with the region and decided that the land down by the Sacramento River, which they named &quot;New Hope&quot;, would be the next Nauvoo of the Mormons, but with real refuge and religious freedom. After disputes between members over land and other affairs, the city of &quot;New Hope&quot; quickly failed. Brannan is often credited to have been the first to perform certain actions in the region: a non-Catholic wedding ceremony, the first to preach in English, and the first to set up a California public school and a flour mill.

Brannan used his press to establish the &quot;California Star&quot; as the first newspaper in San Francisco, which released its first formal issue on January 9, 1847. It was the second paper in California, following &quot;The Californian&quot; founded in Monterey and first published on August 15, 1846. The two joined to become &quot;The Daily Alta California&quot; in 1848 after Brannan sold the paper to a colleague.

In June 1847, Brannan traveled overland to Green River, Wyoming, to meet with Brigham Young, the head of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who was leading the first contingent of Mormon pioneers across the plains to the Great Basin region. Brannan urged Young to bring the Mormon pioneers to California as was previously planned, but Young rejected the proposal in favor of settling in what is present-day Utah. Brannan returned to northern California frustrated with how the meeting had gone. Being the only church leader of that region, Brannan continued to receive tithes of the church members, but no records have been found showing that those tithes were forwarded to the leaders of the church in Utah. Many members stopped paying him and began making their way eastward toward Salt Lake Valley.

=== California Gold Rush ===

In 1847, Brannan opened a store at Sutter&#x27;s Fort, in present-day Sacramento, California. During that time he also built many large buildings in both Sacramento and San Francisco. Early in 1848, employees of John Sutter paid for goods in Brannan&#x27;s store with gold they had found at Sutter&#x27;s Mill, near Coloma, California, by employees of James W. Marshall, who was managing Sutter&#x27;s sawmill. Some of his employees had been in the Mormon Battalion, and he later found the deceased of the Donner Party. Brannan&#x27;s &quot;California Star&quot; paper could not publish the news of the gold strike, as the staff had left in a rush for the gold fields. Yet he owned the only store between San Francisco and the gold fields — a fact he capitalized on by buying up all the picks, shovels and pans he could find, and then running up and down the streets of San Francisco, shouting &#x27;Gold! Gold on the American River!&#x27; He purchased pans for 20 cents each and resold them for $15 each, making $36,000 in nine weeks

=== San Francisco and Sacramento ===
In 1848, Brannan decided that he was going to use all of his resources in order to help build up California and its connection with the east. He planned on building that connection through the &quot;California Star Express&quot;, which would deliver mail from San Francisco to Independence, Missouri, and had its first route on April 1, 1848. Brannan had opened more stores to sell goods to the miners (his Sutter Fort store sold US$150,000 a month in 1849), and began buying land in San Francisco. He also acquired all of the remaining assets of the failed &quot;New Hope&quot; project and like many other Mormons at this time, found his focus had turned from LDS Church affairs to monetary gains.

Using his profits and possibly the proceeds of tithing paid to him as an LDS Church representative, Brannan bought land from Sutter in the Sacramento area. Around this same time Brannan established ship trade with China, Hawaii, and the east coast. His land holdings extended to southern California and to Hawaii where, in 1851, he visited and purchased large amounts of land in Honolulu. He and other landowners and speculators raised the price of Californian land considerably, angering many. The disagreement escalated during 1850 into the Squatters&#x27; Riot, during which the squatters&#x27; spokesman, Doctor Charles L. Robinson, was shot, along with others. Nine people were killed. Brannan was considered the instigator of the incident.

In a few accounts of Brannan&#x27;s dealings with the LDS Church it is said that Brigham Young sent the apostle Amasa Lyman to collect the tithing money that Brannan had withheld from the church&#x27;s institution. When Lyman arrived, Brannan was unable to account for the tithes that Brigham Young and other Mormons claimed were given to him or that he owed from his own personal income. He reportedly told them, &quot;You go back and tell Brigham Young that I&#x27;ll give up the Lord&#x27;s money when he sends me a receipt signed by the Lord&quot;, although historians, such as Will Bagley, have found that this is likely just legend. In another account, Lyman was sent to gather $10,000 of owed tithing from Brannan (or more if he was willing). After a couple of visits all of Brannan&#x27;s debts to the LDS Church were considered to be paid in full.

Even with many financial upsets, Brannan became California&#x27;s first millionaire. Brannan was elected to the first town council of San Francisco in the new U.S. territory. In 1851, after a series of sensational crimes in the area, he helped organize and was the first president of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, which functioned as a &quot;de facto&quot; police force with a propensity for hanging. In 1853, he was elected as a Senator to the California State Senate in the new state&#x27;s capital of Sacramento. By this time California had become part of the United States and had gained statehood in 1850.

In order to continue the settlement of the west, Brannan purchased California&#x27;s first steam locomotive in an effort to hasten the building of the first western railroad. He also teamed up with other local capitalists to construct the first wharf in San Francisco. Around this same time, Brannan made known his feelings about slavery and spoke out against it.

On July 11, 1851, Parley P. Pratt and his mission companions ventured to San Francisco to establish the Pacific Mission of the LDS Church. The action Brannan took as a leader of the Vigilantes in 1851 was heavily frowned upon by the Mormons. On August 25, 1851, he was disfellowshipped from the LDS Church for &quot;a general course of unchristianlike conduct, neglect of duty, and for combining with lawless assemblies to commit murder and other crimes.&quot;

Anecdotes claim that in 1858, Brannan paid $1,500 (~$ in ) for lumber salvaged from a ship that foundered in waters near San Francisco, and on the basalt the headlands of the San Francisco Peninsula overlooking the mouth of the Golden Gate. The story further claims that he used the material to build the first Cliff House, which is a popular restaurant and recreational area. There is no historical evidence to support this claim.

=== Calistoga ===

After Brannan visited the hot springs in the upper Napa Valley in 1859, he planned a new resort for the area. He bought land containing the springs in the northern portion of the Rancho Carne Humana in 1861 and founded the town of Calistoga, said to be a combination of the words &quot;California&quot; and then-fashionable Saratoga Springs in New York. Brannan also founded the Napa Valley Railroad in 1864 in order to provide tourists with an easier way to reach Calistoga from the San Francisco Bay ferry boats that docked in the lower Napa Valley at Vallejo. The railroad was later sold at a foreclosure sale in Napa County in 1869. Many poorer Calistoga residents were angered by Brannan&#x27;s take-over of the region. At one point the opposition was so intense that Brannan was shot eight times. Brannan survived, but used a cane for the rest of his life.

In 1870, Anna Eliza Corwin divorced Brannan. They had grown apart as Eliza lived in Europe for quite some time while Brannan remained in California. In the aftermath of the divorce, the judge ruled that his wife was entitled to half of their holdings in cash. The majority of Brannan&#x27;s holdings were in real estate and he had to liquidate the properties to pay the full divorce settlement.

==Later years, death, and legacy==
Following the divorce, he became a brewer and developed a problem with alcohol. Leaving San Francisco, the city he helped develop, he moved south to Mexico. Brannan set up a small ranch near the Mexican border in the state of Sonora. This is where his newly acquired tract of land was located, which was given to him in 1880 by President Benito Juárez and the Mexican government after helping them expel unwanted Frenchmen from Mexican lands. In 1888, at the age of 69, he was paid the sum of $49,000 in interest from the Mexican government. Brannan traveled to San Francisco to pay his debts. He quit drinking and settled all his debts, but he died without sufficient funds to pay for his own funeral. Brannan died at age 70 in Escondido, California, Sunday, May 5, 1889, from inflammation of the bowels. Brannan&#x27;s body lay unclaimed in the San Diego County receiving vault for over a year until it was recognized by chance. He was given a Christian burial and for many years, only a stake marked his grave. He is interred at Mount Hope Cemetery.

===Legacy===
American historian Hubert Howe Bancroft described Samuel Brannan&#x27;s achievements saying:
His other legacies included:
* Brannan Street in San Francisco was named after Samuel Brannan.
* California cities that claim Brannan as their founder include Calistoga and Yuba City.
* In partnership with John Augustus Sutter, Jr. and with William Tecumseh Sherman and Edward Ord as surveyors, Brannan laid out the unofficial subdivisions that became the city of Sacramento.
*Author of the forever known shout, &quot;Gold, Gold, Gold&quot; which created one of the biggest migrations of people from around the world to a small state the world knows as California.

<doc id="347018" wikidata="Q5097930" url="?curid=347018" title="Child slavery">
<text>Child slavery is the slavery of children. The enslavement of children can be traced back through history. Even after the abolition of slavery, children continue to be enslaved and trafficked in modern times, which is a particular problem in developing countries.

==History==
Child slavery refers of the slavery of children below the age of majority. Many children have been sold into slavery in the past for their family to repay debts or crimes or earn some money if the family were short of cash. In the Roman Empire, the children of a slave woman normally became the property of her owner. This was also the case in Korea around 1000 AD. Since slavery among the Maya and indigenous people of North America could be inherited, the children of the Indians could be born slaves.

Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote about a woman a slave owner bought to breed children to sell. The expectations of children who were either bought or born into slavery varied. Scholars noted, &quot;age and physical capacity, as well as the degree of dependence, set the terms of children&#x27;s integration into households&quot;.

The duties that child slaves were responsible for performing are disputed among scholars. A few representations of the lives that slave children led portrayed them as, &quot;virtually divorced from the plantation economy until they were old enough to be employed as field hands, thereby emphasizing the carefree nature of childhood for a part of the slave population that was temporarily spared forced labor&quot;. This view also stated that if children were asked to perform any duties at all, it was to perform light household chores, such as being &quot;organized into &#x27;trash gangs&#x27; and made to collect refuse about the estate&quot;. Opposing scholars argued that slave children had their youth stolen from them, and were forced to start performing adult duties at a very young age. Some say that children were forced to perform field labor duties as young as the age of six. It is argued that in some areas children were put to &quot;regular work in the antebellum South&quot; and it &quot;was a time when slaves began to learn work routines, but also work discipline and related punishment&quot;.

A degree of self-possession was present in some degree to adults, but &quot;children retained the legal incapacities of dependence even after they had become productive members of households&quot;. It was reported by scholars that, &quot;this distinctive status shaped children&#x27;s standing within familial households and left them subject to forced apprenticeship, even after emancipation&quot;. There were slave owners who did not want child slaves or women who were pregnant for fear that the child would have &quot;took up too much of her time&quot;.

The conditions of slavery for pregnant women varied regionally. In most cases, women worked in the fields up until childbirth performing small tasks. &quot;four weeks appears to have been the average confinement period, or &#x27;lying-in period&#x27;, for antebellum slave women following delivery in the South as a whole&quot;. Slaveholders in northern Virginia, however, usually only permitted an average lying-in period of about &quot;two weeks before ordering new mothers back to work&quot;. The responsibility of raising and tending to the children then became the task of other children and older elderly slaves. In most institutions of slavery throughout the world, the children of slaves became the property of the owner. This created a constant supply of people to perform labor. This was the case with, for example, thralls and American slaves. In other cases, children were enslaved as if they were adults. Usually, the mother&#x27;s status determined if the child was a slave, but some local laws varied the decision to the father. In many cultures, slaves could earn their freedom through hard work and buying their own freedom.

==Modern day==
Although the abolition of slavery in much of the world has greatly reduced child slavery, the problem lives on, especially in developing countries. According to the Anti-Slavery Society, &quot;Although there is no longer any state which legally recognizes, or which will enforce, a claim by a person to a right of property over another, the abolition of slavery does not mean that it ceased to exist. There are millions of people throughout the world—mainly children—in conditions of virtual to slavery.&quot; It further notes that slavery, particularly child slavery, was on the rise in 2003. It points out that there are countless others in other forms of servitude (such as peonage, bonded labor, and servile concubinage) that are not slavery in the narrow legal sense. Critics claim they are stretching the definition and practice of slavery beyond its original meaning and are actually referring to forms of unfree labor other than slavery. In 1990, reports of slavery came out of Bahr al Ghazal, a Dinka region in southern Sudan. In 1995, Dinka mothers spoke about their abducted children. Roughly 20,000 slaves were reported in Sudan in 1999. &quot;The handmade woolen carpet industry is extremely labor-intensive and one of the largest export earners for India, Pakistan, Nepal and Morocco.&quot; During the past 20 years, about 200,000 and 300,000 children have been involved, most of them in the carpet belt of Uttar Pradesh in central India. Many children in Asia are kidnapped or trapped in servitude, where they work in factories and workshops for no pay and receive constant beatings. Slaves have reappeared following the old slave trade routes in West Africa. &quot;The children are kidnapped or purchased for $20–$70 each in poorer states, such as Benin and Togo, and sold into slavery in sex dens or as unpaid domestic servants for $350.00 each in wealthier oil-rich states, such as Nigeria and Gabon.&quot;

===Trafficking===

Trafficking of children includes recruiting, harboring, obtaining, and transporting children by use of force or fraud for the purpose of subjecting them to involuntary acts, such as commercial sexual exploitation (including prostitution) or involuntary labor, i.e., enslavement. Some see human trafficking as the modern form of slavery. Human trafficking is the trade of human beings and their use by criminals to make money. The majority of trafficking victims are adults, predominantly made up of women forced into prostitution, but children make up many victims forced into prostitution. 

In Ukraine, a survey conducted by the non-governmental organization (NGO) La Strada-Ukraine in 2001–2003, based on a sample of 106 women being trafficked out of Ukraine found that 3% were under 18, and the US State Department reported in 2004 that incidents of minors being trafficked was increasing. In Thailand, NGOs have estimated that up to a third of prostitutes are children under 18, many trafficked from outside Thailand.

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography estimates that about one million children in Asia alone are victims of the sex trade.

Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Save the Children, World Vision and the British Red Cross have called for an immediate halt to adoptions of Haitian children not approved before the earthquake, warning that child traffickers could exploit the lack of regulation. An Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights spokesman said that child enslavement and trafficking was &quot;an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and months&quot;.

===Child soldiers===

The United Nations defines child soldier as &quot;A child associated with an armed force or armed group refers to any person below 18 years of age who is, or who has been, recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to children, boys, and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, spies or for sexual purposes.&quot; In 2007, Human Rights Watch estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 children served as soldiers in current conflicts. In 2012, this estimation rose to be around 300,000 in only twenty countries. Around 40% of child soldiers are believed to be girls, that have been taken and used as sex slaves and &#x27;wives&#x27;.

===Forced labor===
More girls under 16 work as domestic workers than any other category of child labor, often sent to cities by parents living in rural poverty such as in restaveks in Haiti.

<text>Brown Hill Creek, also known as Willawilla in the Kaurna language, is a watercourse flowing from the Adelaide Hills through in the inner south suburbs of the Adelaide metropolitan area, in the Australian state of South Australia. It is part of the Patawalonga River catchment.

==Course and features==
The creek rises on the western slopes of the Mount Lofty Ranges near Crafers and flows generally in a west-north-west direction through the suburb of Brown Hill Creek, south of Brown Hill, a prominent hill rising immediately south-east of Mitcham village, and beneath the historic Keystone Bridge in Mitcham itself, the vicinity traditionally known as Wirraparinga.

From Mitcham the creek continues along a north-western path through Torrens Park, Hawthorn, Unley Park, Millswood and Forestville before flowing into a constructed drain at Forestville Reserve. From there the flows are directed through inner south-west suburbs to join the Patawalonga River on the southern edge of Adelaide Airport, near Netley.

State government records state that the full downstream extent of the original creek is unknown due to the construction of drains along the creek line.

==Human use==
The area beside the creek in the suburbs of Mitcham and Brown Hill Creek was known to the Kaurna people of the Adelaide Plains as &quot;Wirraparinga&quot;, meaning &quot;creek and scrub place&quot;.

The creek valley south of Brown Hill is home to Brownhill Creek Recreation Park and has been the site of a recreation park since the late 1800s. A bathing hole was established at a constructed dam on the creek near Mitcham village in 1894 but was removed eight years later to protect the interests of market gardeners. A camping ground at the entrance to the valley was declared in 1954 in the &quot;National Pleasure resort&quot; and a stone plaque declaring a &quot;pleasure resort&quot; from the early part of the 20th century still stands at the site. A caravan park is presently located at the site of the original camping ground and the recreation reserve extends several kilometres upstream into the main creek valley.

The upper reaches of the creek are utilised especially for market gardening and also watering pasture. In the 1870s, some of the upper gullies of the creek were considered as a possible location for a reservoir to supply Adelaide&#x27;s growing population with water. Thorndon Park Reservoir was eventually built instead.

<text>PSA Airlines, Inc. is an American regional airline headquartered at Dayton International Airport in Dayton, Ohio. The airline is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Airlines Group and it is paid by fellow group member American Airlines to staff, operate and maintain aircraft used on American Eagle flights that are scheduled, marketed and sold by American Airlines.

PSA Airlines operates a fleet consisting of exclusively Bombardier regional jet aircraft. The company has a team of more than 5,000 employees, operating more than 800 daily flights to nearly 100 destinations.

The airline is named after Pacific Southwest Airlines (commonly known as PSA), one of the predecessors of today&#x27;s American Airlines, to protect the trademark.

==History==

===Vee Neal Airlines===
Named after its owner Vee Neal Frey, Vee Neal Airlines was established in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and received an air operator&#x27;s certificate in 1979. At first, the company operated as a fixed-base operator, and later added scheduled service between Latrobe and Pittsburgh with a Cessna 402 in May 1980.

Following the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, nearby Erie, Pennsylvania, saw a decline in service, and Vee Neal saw an opportunity. The company made several unsuccessful attempts to start a new airline operation out of Erie International Airport using Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante aircraft. A breakthrough would finally come in April 1983 when USAir announced it would further reduce frequencies out of Erie and would discontinue nonstop service to Chicago from Erie. Vee Neal Airlines was able to raise venture capital from a group of civic and business leaders, investors and corporations in the Erie area. The money was used to purchase six British Aerospace Jetstream 31 aircraft, which would operate out of Erie, PA.

===Jetstream International Airlines===
In December 1983, the airline was renamed to Jetstream International Airlines (JIA) after it took delivery of its first two Jetstream aircraft. The next year, the company relocated its maintenance department and corporate headquarters from Latrobe to Erie.

Jetstream established a network of routes between Erie and Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Harrisburg, Newark, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington, D.C. In addition, Jetstream provided service between Youngstown, Ohio, and both airports in Detroit.

The airline struggled financially, but on September 26, 1985, it secured a deal with Piedmont Airlines to operate flights under the Piedmont Commuter brand connecting Erie with Piedmont&#x27;s Baltimore and Dayton hubs and Youngstown with Baltimore.

Still suffering financially, the next year Piedmont offered to buy Jetstream in a deal that closed on August 1, 1986. Piedmont immediately pivoted Jetstream&#x27;s business model, making it a Piedmont Commuter feeder for their Dayton hub on September 15, 1986. In 1987, Jetstream once again moved its corporate headquarters, this time to its new base of operations in Dayton.

Parent company Piedmont Airlines was purchased by USAir in November 1987 and was fully merged into the airline on August 5, 1989. After the merger, Jetstream International Airlines started to operate under the USAir Express brand.

===PSA Airlines===
In the early 1990s, the airline began to replace its namesake Jetstream aircraft, first with leased Embraer EMB 120 aircraft, and later with the purchase of Dornier 328 aircraft. Reflecting that change, USAir announced in November 1995, that it would rename Jetstream International Airlines &quot;PSA Airlines&quot; and move the headquarters to Vandalia, Ohio. The name change allowed USAir to protect the brand Pacific Southwest Airlines (commonly known as just PSA), which USAir had purchased at about the same time that it purchased Piedmont. USAir had already assigned the name Piedmont Airlines to Henson Airlines in 1993. By March 1996, the last Jetstream aircraft was replaced and PSA&#x27;s stable of 25 Dornier 328 aircraft was the largest Dornier fleet in the world.In February 1997, USAir changed their name to US Airways, and PSA transitioned to operating under the name of US Airways Express.

On August 11, 2002, US Airways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. During the reorganization, PSA was chosen to transition to a fleet of regional jet aircraft, including the Bombardier CRJ200 and CRJ700. The last Dornier 328 was retired from the PSA fleet in September 2004.

US Airways entered a second Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 12, 2004, and was acquired by America West Airlines in 2005 in a reverse merger.

In February 2005, PSA opened its Charlotte crew base. The recently opened Philadelphia crew and maintenance bases also closed in September 2005. The Philadelphia crew base has since reopened, but maintenance is provided on-site by contract maintenance company STS Aviation Group.

In January 2008, US Airways flight activity at the Pittsburgh International Airport was significantly reduced due to market condition changes. US Airways mainline employees took over the US Airways Express flight operations at the airport and PSA ceased providing ground-handling services at the airport.

In 2015, after the merger of American Airlines and US Airways, PSA became part of American Airlines Group and started to operate American Eagle flights.

In August 2015, PSA Airlines announced a maintenance base would be established at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.

In August 2016, PSA Airlines announced a new 45,000-square-foot maintenance base would be opening in late 2016 at the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSP).

On January 29, 2025, hours before their first crash, PSA Airlines announced that it plans to move its corporate headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina from Dayton, Ohio by January 2026; most daily departures are from, and almost all training is in Charlotte. The new headquarters is to have 400 employees; all 350 Dayton headquarters staff have until the end of April 2025 to accept an invitation to move there. The airline will maintain a maintenance hangar and flight crew location in Dayton, with a total of 550 employees.

The airline began taking deliveries of them in the second quarter of 2014 to finish initial delivery in 2015. In addition, American acquired options to purchase up to 40 additional CRJ-900 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2015 through 2016. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CRJ200 fleet consisting of 35 aircraft was retired at an accelerated rate.

<text>ZZT is a 1991 action-adventure puzzle video game and game creation system developed and published by Potomac Computer Systems for MS-DOS. It was later released as freeware in 1997. It is an early game allowing user-generated content using object-oriented programming. Players control a smiley face to battle various creatures and solve puzzles in different grid-based boards in a chosen world. It has four worlds where players explore different boards and interact with objects such as ammo, bombs, and scrolls to reach the end of the game. It includes an in-game editor, allowing players to develop worlds using the game&#x27;s scripting language, ZZT-OOP.

The game was designed by mechanical engineering student Tim Sweeney in roughly six to nine months. It was built from a text editor conceived in 1989 to build a better editor for Pascal, after he disliked editors that came with other programming languages. During development, he experimented with adding creatures and characters. He built boards that grew into worlds and refined the editor he used to create his own gameswhile studying at university. Initially, he made the game for himself, but after positive reception from his friends and neighbors, and seeing the potential for making a profit by releasing the game under shareware, he released it publicly. He marketed the game by distributing it across shareware vendors and bulletin board systems, earning money through mail orders for registered worlds.

&quot;ZZT&quot; was a commercial success, with around 4,000–5,000 copies by 2009. The game received mixed reception. Much of the positive reception focused on the gameplay, editor, and the community it developed. Criticisms focused on the game&#x27;s graphical and audio limitations and perceived unfair difficulty. The sequel is &quot;Super ZZT&quot; (1991). Other &quot;ZZT&quot; worlds were published later as &quot;Best of ZZT&quot; (1992) and &quot;ZZT&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1992). &quot;ZZT&quot;″s success led Sweeney to change his company&#x27;s name to Epic MegaGames, and focus on competing as a video game company using shareware to distribute commercial games. Epic MegaGames later developed other successful games including &quot;Jill of the Jungle&quot; (1992) and &quot;Unreal&quot; (1998), using lessons from &quot;ZZT&quot;″s success by focusing on developing the editor and engine to allow others to more easily make games. The game inspired one of the earliest active modding communities, which has grown by making new worlds, editing tools, and source ports, and inspiring some in the community to pursue a career in the video game industry.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;ZZT&quot; is a top-down action-adventure puzzle video game and game creation system. Players control a white smiley face on a navy blue rectangle that can move around in four directions. Players can interact with objects by touching or shooting at them. Touching ammo containers, gems, torches, and keys adds them to your status bar. Boxes of ammo allow players to fire bullets at objects, gems increase health and are used as currency, torches light up a small area around the player in dark boards, and colored keys allow players to open same-colored doors. Other objects in the game include bombs, doors, and scrolls. One type of object called &quot;Object&quot; interacts based on written scripts using the game&#x27;s scripting language, ZZT-OOP. As an example, the object could be programmed to give the player health, or fire bullets at the player, flashing text in response. At any time, players can save their progress, and return to the game&#x27;s exact state.

Game worlds are made up of objects within grid boards that connect to each other. Players can move across different boards by either reaching the edge of the board or entering teleporters. Six game worlds were made for the game&#x27;s release; four of them are game worlds, and each of the four starts in a different area. &quot;Town of ZZT&quot; starts in a hub world with four buildings mixed with six exits, &quot;Caves of ZZT&quot; opens with a sparse area of torches and a scroll, &quot;Dungeons of ZZT&quot; starts with a linear opening sequence with gates that lock the player inside, and &quot;City of ZZT&quot; opens with a city street as a hub with a few structures. Two other worlds were included, serving different purposes. &quot;Guided Tour ZZT&#x27;s Other Worlds&quot; previews boards of each game worlds, and &quot;Demo of the ZZT World Editor&quot; creates parallels to a museum by showing all of the items, terrains, and creatures that make up &quot;ZZT&quot;. The goal for players are to reach the end board, progressing either by collecting purple keys to open locked doors, or gathering objects throughout the world. Boards can contain action or puzzles. Action boards have the player face off against creatures. Creatures include lions, tigers, and bears. When creatures, bullets, or stars touch the player, health is lost. Once the player runs out of health, the game ends. Puzzles consist of untangling combinations of boulders, sliders, and pushers, or mazes that can include invisible walls and teleporters. Some puzzles can trap the player, leading players to require returning to an earlier save.

&quot;ZZT&quot; includes an in-game editor, allowing players to make their own worlds. Players start with yellow normal walls surrounding a new board as a blank screen. The editor allows players to add and arrange items, creatures, and terrain, and connect different boards together. Each board can be set to include specific settings, such as adding a time limit, making the board dark so the player could not see the board without a torch, or limiting the number of bullets on screen at any given time. Each board had its own isolated variables within the game, and through scripting players could create ten different boolean flags for the environment, shared across boards. Using ZZT-OOP, objects can be named, given commands for actions, and can send and receive messages. Everything within &quot;ZZT&quot; is displayed in the 255 characters of the IBM PC&#x27;s character set to create environments. The game supports sixteen colors, but the editor only permits seven colors for colorable objects, and has limits in the amount of objects being placed in each board. Players eventually learned additional ways to add more colors to the game utilizing commands and different text characters, and editing world files. The PC speaker permits seven notes at several different octaves, and instruments with unique pitches of clicks, pops, and snaps to represent percussion. Sounds are played through normal gameplay, or making custom sounds through scripting.

== Development ==

Video game programmer Tim Sweeney, studying mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland, first developed &quot;ZZT&quot; as a text editor in Turbo Pascal. During this time, Tim did not know how to program graphics and only had a 286 computer and a Model M keyboard. The text editor idea came from disliking the included editors for the programming languages he tried on his PC. Instead he wanted to recreate his previously made Pascal-like programming environment for the Apple II. He experimented with adding collision to text characters, and made the cursor a controllable character. He found it more fun to make it into a game by adding bullets and creatures to fight. From there, he designed his first levels from text files, creating different boards similar in style to Atari&#x27;s &quot;Adventure&quot;, while continually offering additions to the game and editor. Sweeney studied during the day, and worked on his game during the night. The text-based graphics allowed him to produce ideas such as talking trees or interesting characters without breaking immersion. Most of these additions were his own, but he occasionally took ideas from &quot;Kroz&quot;, such as the bomb. Development took around six to nine months, with under 1,000 hours of time spent developing the game, and making around 20,000 lines of Pascal code.

He shared it with friends and neighborhood kids, taking notes of their joy and excitement playing his own game. He discovered that making games allowed him to share something to the world, and could earn more income compared to wage earners, and chose to sell the game. The game&#x27;s episodic model took inspiration from Apogee&#x27;s shareware model, and he encouraged spreading the game across shareware vendors, user groups, and bulletin board systems. He operated his company out of his bedroom, having orders sent to his parents&#x27; address, where he would send the remaining episodes on floppy disks by mail delivery. During development, he wrote to Scott Miller for advice and to learn more about the industry. Miller responded with advice and encouragement. Sweeney chose the name so it would be listed last alphabetically in shareware catalogs and on bulletin board systems, though a fan later suggested the backronym of &quot;Zoo of Zero Tolerance&quot;, which Sweeney endorsed. He sold it as the first major game with object-oriented programming. &quot;ZZT&quot; was released on January 15, 1991. &quot;Town of ZZT&quot; alongside the in-game editor was distributed freely, while the other official worlds could be ordered to receive a single floppy disk including the purchased worlds, and drawn maps of each of the worlds. At one point, &quot;City of ZZT&quot; was also distributed as &quot;ZZT&#x27;s City&quot;, through Softdisk&#x27;s On Disk Monthly service. Each of the remaining official worlds, along with other &quot;ZZT&quot; games were later released as freeware on October 10, 1997.

== Reception ==
Following &quot;ZZT&quot;″s release, about three to four copies were sold daily, at around 800 copies by November 1991, and around 4,000 to 5,000 copies in total by 2009. Sweeney earned around per day by November 1991, and around from &quot;ZZT&quot; by May 1999, of which most of the profit came from its first year. After Sweeney moved out of his parents&#x27; house to establish proper corporate headquarters for Potomac Computer Systems, then renamed Epic MegaGames, his father Paul Sweeney, continued fulfilling mail orders to the original address under the Epic Classics label, allowing for purchase of physical copies of &quot;ZZT&quot;. The final copy of &quot;ZZT&quot; was shipped to game designer Zack Hiwiller in November 2013.

Contemporary and retrospective reviews from critics were mixed. A comment from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; billed &quot;ZZT&quot; as &quot;truly charming&quot;, finding the gameplay simple to learn. Scott Wolf of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; (US) stated the graphics and sound for &quot;ZZT&quot; to be &quot;truly awful&quot;, while the gameplay serves as a flashback to &quot;when gameplay was not overshadowed by flashy video and animation&quot;. Benj Edwards has called &quot;ZZT&quot; an &quot;influential and underrated game&quot;, crediting its current enjoyment from playing community made worlds and making unexpected things with the &quot;fairly robust&quot; built in editor. This is while crediting the official worlds for being a &quot;depthy adventure game full of puzzles, challenge, and humor&quot;. Chris Kohler of Wired called it a simple, fun, and not always intuitive game design tool under the façade of a simple adventure game, blending seamless game design and play that makes it attractive and user-friendly. He found making a game fun, due to the interface being nearly identical to the game, allowing for the easy placement of objects and terrain. &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot;″s Ollie Toms focused on the editor, finding the game to be &quot;a colourful, characterful, years-long course in scripting and programming games&quot;. He wrote that though ZZT-OOP was basic and limited, children could learn about and make games without knowing anything about programming. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; in a podcast episode stated &quot;ZZT&quot; was &quot;not all that fun&quot;, criticizing that official worlds and community made worlds included unavoidable damage, and instant death. They found that games that attempted to expand and push the engine further are generally &quot;rough around the edges&quot;, or &quot;more functional rather than good&quot;. Rather, they admired &quot;ZZT&quot; like a science experiment or a demo from a demoscene, existing to study and push the limits of &quot;ZZT&quot;, finding the game itself and the community that built from it technically impressive.

== Legacy ==
By getting $100 per day from &quot;ZZT&quot;, Sweeney was convinced he could earn enough from the shareware industry, and decided to work in the video game industry. He renamed the company to Epic MegaGames in October 1991. Shortly after the release of &quot;ZZT&quot;, Sweeney started a level designer contest for registered users to make their own worlds and submit them to him. Over 200 users submitted their custom worlds. The best collaboration games that won the contest were included in &quot;The Best of ZZT&quot; and &quot;ZZT&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, released in 1992. The winners of the contest received prizes of gift certificates, while others would receive honorable mentions. The six winning custom worlds that made up &quot;ZZT&#x27;s Revenge&quot; earned the designers employment in Epic MegaGames, with the winning worlds being &quot;Ezanya&quot;, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Crypt&quot;, &quot;Smiley Guy&quot;, &quot;Manor&quot;, and &quot;Darbytown&quot;. Sweeney later asked one of these developers, Allen Pilgrim, to create the shareware world &quot;Monster Zoo&quot; for the sequel to &quot;ZZT&quot;, &quot;Super ZZT&quot;, released on October 15, 1991. Other worlds available for purchase were &quot;Proving Grounds&quot; and &quot;Lost Forest&quot;. The game plays similarly to &quot;ZZT&quot;, while adding more features such as greater colors accessible within its editor, new enemies and objects, and scrolling map screens that allowed for larger boards than in &quot;ZZT&quot;. Although &quot;Super ZZT&quot; incorporated several additions to &quot;ZZT&quot;, it never caught on with the &quot;ZZT&quot; community like the original &quot;ZZT&quot; did, and very few games were ever created for &quot;Super ZZT&quot;, with one reason being due to the editor being hidden during normal play.

After publishing &quot;Best of ZZT&quot; and &quot;ZZT&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, Sweeney realized the community began creating worlds that reached or exceeded the quality of his work. Furthermore, he believed that games with cutting edge graphics and sound similar in commercial quality to Super Nintendo Entertainment System or Sega Genesis games would have higher sales in the shareware model, taking influence from &quot;Commander Keen&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem&quot;. As such, he moved away from &quot;ZZT&quot; indefinitely to work on other projects like &quot;Jill of the Jungle&quot;. He has commented on wanting to build a massive-multiplayer online version of &quot;ZZT&quot; during an interview, but his future focus on the company was to move forward with new franchises, while learning from the success of &quot;ZZT&quot;. Sweeney and Mark Rein later credited that much of the core idea of &quot;Unreal&quot; and &quot;Unreal Engine&quot; came from what Sweeney learned from the success of &quot;ZZT&quot;, with a focus on building games with clean code and editing tools, so that others can build their own games. Mark Rein has claimed that &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; became a spiritual successor to the game thanks to the game&#x27;s modding community and versatile developer tools.
An early modding community emerged within Prodigy, America Online, Compuserve, and the Internet. Many fan-made worlds and editing tools are curated on a fan website, &quot;Museum of ZZT&quot;. The game provided the community with an outlet for creativity and self-expression without artistic or programming skills, especially among stigmatized groups such as transgender people. As of 2021, more than 3,000 worlds have been created using the built in editor, or third party editors such as KevEdit. Tim Sweeney has claimed that tens of thousands of workers in the game industry have previously made worlds in &quot;ZZT&quot;. A port called &quot;Zeta&quot; allows for playing &quot;ZZT&quot; games on Windows or a web browser, and another source port, &quot;DreamZZT&quot;, allows ports to consoles, specifically the Dreamcast and Nintendo DS. Worlds continue to be developed that have expanded beyond its intended genre, creating shoot &#x27;em ups, falling block puzzle games, complex role-playing games, and point-and-click adventure games, sometimes deriving from other entertainment releases. The source code of &quot;ZZT&quot; was lost in a computer crash, a community developer, Adrian Siekierka, reconstructed and released the source code in 2020, creating a binary accurate executable of &quot;ZZT&quot; with Sweeney&#x27;s permission.

On January 28, 2023, the original source code for &quot;ZZT&quot; 3.0 (without third party content) was uploaded to GitHub under the MIT License with permission of Tim Sweeney.

Other games have been inspired by &quot;ZZT&quot;, such as &quot;MegaZeux&quot;, &quot;PuzzleScript&quot;, and &quot;Frog Fractions 2&quot;, and authors of &quot;ZZT&quot; worlds became professional video game developers. &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; has made comparisons to &quot;Minecraft&quot; and &quot;Roblox&quot;, in its ability to serve as a start for new video game developers. &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; found similarities in its seamless blend of gameplay and editing to &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot;.

<text>An amorphous metal (also known as metallic glass, glassy metal, or shiny metal) is a solid metallic material, usually an alloy, with disordered atomic-scale structure. Most metals are crystalline in their solid state, which means they have a highly ordered arrangement of atoms. Amorphous metals are non-crystalline, and have a glass-like structure. But unlike common glasses, such as window glass, which are typically electrical insulators, amorphous metals have good electrical conductivity and can show metallic luster.

Amorphous metals can be produced in several ways, including extremely rapid cooling, physical vapor deposition, solid-state reaction, ion irradiation, and mechanical alloying. Small batches of amorphous metals have been produced through a variety of quick-cooling methods, such as amorphous metal ribbons produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk (melt spinning). The rapid cooling (millions of degrees Celsius per second) comes too fast for crystals to form and the material is &quot;locked&quot; in a glassy state. Alloys with cooling rates low enough to allow formation of amorphous structure in thick layers (over ) have been produced; bulk metallic glasses. Batches of amorphous steel with three times the strength of conventional steel alloys have been produced. New techniques such as 3D printing, also characterised by high cooling rates, are an active research topic.

==History==

The first reported metallic glass was Au75Si25, produced at Caltech by Klement, Willens, and Duwez in 1960. This and other early glass-forming alloys had to be rapidly cooled (on the order of one megakelvin per second, 106 K/s) to avoid crystallization. An important consequence of this was that metallic glasses could be produced in a few forms (typically ribbons, foils, or wires) in which one dimension was small so that heat could be extracted quickly enough to achieve the required cooling rate. As a result, metallic glass specimens (with a few exceptions) were limited to thicknesses of less than one hundred microns.

In 1969, an alloy of 77.5% palladium, 6% copper, and 16.5% silicon was found to have critical cooling rate between 100 and 1000 K/s.

In 1976, Liebermann and Graham developed a method of manufacturing thin ribbons of amorphous metal on a supercooled fast-spinning wheel. This was an alloy of iron, nickel, and boron. The material, known as &quot;Metglas&quot;, was commercialized in the early 1980s and became used for low-loss power distribution transformers (amorphous metal transformer). Metglas-2605 is composed of 80% iron and 20% boron, has a Curie temperature of and a room temperature saturation magnetization of 1.56 teslas.

In the early 1980s, glassy ingots with a diameter of were produced with an alloy of 55% palladium, 22.5% lead, and 22.5% antimony, by surface etching followed with heating-cooling cycles. Using boron oxide flux, the achievable thickness increased to one centimeter.

In 1982, a study on amorphous metal structural relaxation indicated a relationship between the specific heat and temperature of (Fe0.5Ni0.5)83P17. As the material was heated, the two properties displayed a negative relationship starting at 375 K, due to the change in relaxed amorphous states. When the material was annealed for periods from 1 to 48 hours, the properties instead displayed a positive relationship starting at 475 K for all annealing periods, since the annealing induced structure disappears at that temperature. In this study, amorphous alloys demonstrated glass transition and a super cooled liquid region. Between 1988 and 1992, more studies found more glass-type alloys with glass transition and a super cooled liquid region. From those studies, bulk glass alloys were made of La, Mg, and Zr, and these alloys demonstrated plasticity even with ribbon thickness from 20 μm to 50 μm. The plasticity was a stark difference to past amorphous metals that became brittle at those thicknesses.

In 1988, alloys of lanthanum, aluminium, and copper ore were revealed to be glass-forming. Al-based metallic glasses containing scandium exhibited a record-type tensile mechanical strength of about .

Bulk amorphous alloys of several millimeters in thickness were rare, although Pd-based amorphous alloys had been formed into rods with a diameter by quenching, and spheres with a diameter were formed by repetition flux melting with B2O3 and quenching.

New techniques were found in 1990, producing alloys that form glasses at cooling rates as low as one kelvin per second. These cooling rates can be achieved by simple casting into metallic molds. These alloys can be cast into parts several centimeters thick while retaining an amorphous structure. The best glass-forming alloys were based on zirconium and palladium, but alloys based on iron, titanium, copper, magnesium, and other metals are known. The process exploited a phenomenon called &quot;confusion&quot;. Such alloys contain many elements (often four or more) such that upon cooling sufficiently quickly, constituent atoms cannot achieve an equilibrium crystalline state before their mobility is lost. In this way, the random disordered state of the atoms is &quot;locked in&quot;.

In 1992, the commercial amorphous alloy, Vitreloy 1 (41.2% Zr, 13.8% Ti, 12.5% Cu, 10% Ni, and 22.5% Be), was developed at Caltech, as a part of Department of Energy and NASA research of new aerospace materials.

By 2000, research in Tohoku University and Caltech yielded multicomponent alloys based on lanthanum, magnesium, zirconium, palladium, iron, copper, and titanium, with critical cooling rate between 1 K/s and 100 K/s, comparable to oxide glasses.

In 2004, bulk amorphous steel was successfully produced by a groups at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which refers to their product as &quot;glassy steel&quot;, and another at University of Virginia, named &quot;DARVA-Glass 101&quot;. The product is non-magnetic at room temperature and significantly stronger than conventional steel.

In 2018, a team at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Northwestern University reported the use of artificial intelligence to predict and evaluate samples of 20,000 different likely metallic glass alloys in a year.

==Properties==

Amorphous metal is usually an alloy rather than a pure metal. The alloys contain atoms of significantly different sizes, leading to low free volume (and therefore up to orders of magnitude higher viscosity than other metals and alloys) in molten state. The viscosity prevents the atoms from moving enough to form an ordered lattice. The material displays low shrinkage during cooling, and resistance to plastic deformation. The absence of grain boundaries, the weak spots of crystalline materials, leads to better wear resistance and less corrosion. Amorphous metals, while technically glasses, are much tougher and less brittle than oxide glasses and ceramics. Amorphous metals are either non-ferromagnetic, if they are composed of Ln, Mg, Zr, Ti, Pd, Ca, Cu, Pt and Au, or ferromagnetic, if they are composed of Fe, Co, and Ni.

Thermal conductivity is lower than in crystalline metals. As formation of amorphous structure relies on fast cooling, this limits the thickness of amorphous structures. To form amorphous structure despite slower cooling, the alloy has to be made of three or more components, leading to complex crystal units with higher potential energy and lower odds of formation. The atomic radius of the components has to be significantly different (over 12%), to achieve high packing density and low free volume. The combination of components should have negative mixing heat, inhibiting crystal nucleation and prolonging the time the molten metal stays in supercooled state.

As temperatures change, the electrical resistivity of amorphous metals behaves very different than that of regular metals. While resistivity in crystalline metals generally increases with temperature, following Matthiessen&#x27;s rule, resistivity in many amorphous metals decreases with increasing temperature. This effect can be observed in amorphous metals of high resistivities between 150 and 300 microohm-centimeters. In these metals, the scattering events causing the resistivity of the metal are not statistically independent, thus explaining the breakdown of Matthiessen&#x27;s rule. The fact that the thermal change of the resistivity in amorphous metals can be negative over a large range of temperatures and correlated to their absolute resistivity values was identified by Mooij in 1973, becoming Mooijs-rule.

Alloys of boron, silicon, phosphorus, and other glass formers with magnetic metals (iron, cobalt, nickel) have high magnetic susceptibility, with low coercivity and high electrical resistance. Usually the electrical conductivity of a metallic glass is of the same low order of magnitude as of a molten metal just above the melting point. The high resistance leads to low losses by eddy currents when subjected to alternating magnetic fields, a property useful for e.g. transformer magnetic cores. Their low coercivity also contributes to low loss.

Buckel and Hilsch discovered the superconductivity of amorphous metal thin films experimentally in the early 1950s. For certain metallic elements the superconducting critical temperature &quot;T&quot;c can be higher in the amorphous state (e.g. upon alloying) than in the crystalline state, and in several cases &quot;T&quot;c increases upon increasing the structural disorder. This behavior can be explained by the effect of structural disorder on electron-phonon coupling.

Amorphous metals have higher tensile yield strengths and higher elastic strain limits than polycrystalline metal alloys, but their ductilities and fatigue strengths are lower. 

Amorphous alloys have a variety of potentially useful properties. In particular, they tend to be stronger than crystalline alloys of similar chemical composition, and they can sustain larger reversible (&quot;elastic&quot;) deformations than crystalline alloys. Amorphous metals derive their strength directly from their non-crystalline structure, which does not have defects (such as dislocations) that limit their strength. Vitreloy is an amorphous metal with a tensile strength almost double that of high-grade titanium. However, metallic glasses at room temperature are not ductile and tend to fail suddenly and surprisingly when loaded in tension, which limits applicability in reliability-critical applications. Metal matrix composites consisting of a ductile crystalline metal matrix containing dendritic particles or fibers of an amorphous glass metal are an alternative.

Perhaps the most useful property of bulk amorphous alloys is that they are true glasses, which means that they soften and flow upon heating. This allows for easy processing, such as by injection molding, in much the same way as polymers. As a result, amorphous alloys have been commercialized for use in sports equipment, medical devices, and as cases for electronic equipment.

Thin films of amorphous metals can be deposited as protective coatings via high velocity oxygen fuel.

==Applications==
===Commercial===
The most important application exploits the magnetic properties of some ferromagnetic metallic glasses. The low magnetization loss is used in high efficiency transformers at line frequency and in some higher frequency transformers. Amorphous steel is very brittle that makes it difficult to punch into motor laminations. Electronic article surveillance (such as passive ID tags) often uses metallic glasses because of these magnetic properties.

Ti-based metallic glass, when made into thin pipes, have a high tensile strength of , elastic elongation of 2% and high corrosion resistance. A Ti–Zr–Cu–Ni–Sn metallic glass was used to improve the sensitivity of a Coriolis flow meter. This flow meter is about 28-53 times more sensitive than conventional meters, which can be applied in fossil-fuel, chemical, environmental, semiconductor and medical science industries.

Zr-Al-Ni-Cu based metallic glass can be shaped into pressure sensors for automobile and other industries. Such sensors are smaller, more sensitive, and possess greater pressure endurance than conventional stainless steel. Additionally, this alloy was used to make the world&#x27;s smallest geared motor with diameter at the time.

===Potential===
Amorphous metals exhibit unique softening behavior above their glass transition and this softening has been increasingly explored for thermoplastic forming of metallic glasses. Such low softening temperature supports simple methods for making nanoparticlecomposites (e.g. carbon nanotubes) and bulk metallic glasses. It has been shown that metallic glasses can be patterned on extremely length scales as small as 10 nm. This may solve problems of nanoimprint lithography where expensive nano-molds made of silicon break easily. Nano-molds made from metallic glasses are easy to fabricate and more durable than silicon molds. The superior electronic, thermal and mechanical properties of bulk metallic glasses compared to polymers make them a good option for developing nanocomposites for electronic application such as field electron emission devices.

Ti40Cu36Pd14Zr10 is believed to be noncarcinogenic, is about three times stronger than titanium, and its elastic modulus nearly matches bones. It has a high wear resistance and does not produce abrasion powder. The alloy does not undergo shrinkage on solidification. A surface structure can be generated that is biologically attachable by surface modification using laser pulses, allowing better joining with bone. 

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) has been used to process Zr-based bulk metallic glass (BMG) for biomedical applications. Zr-based BMGs shows good biocompatibility, supporting osteoblastic cell growth similar to Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The favorable response coupled with the ability to tailor surface properties through SLM highlights the promise of SLM Zr- based BMGs like AMLOY-ZR01 for orthopaedic implant applications. However, their degradation under inflammatory conditions requires further investigation.

Mg60Zn35Ca5 is under investigation as a biomaterial for implantation into bones as screws, pins, or plates, to fix fractures. Unlike traditional steel or titanium, this material dissolves in organisms at a rate of roughly 1 millimeter per month and is replaced with bone tissue. This speed can be adjusted by varying the zinc content.

Bulk metallic glasses seem to exhibit superior properties. SAM2X5-630 is claimed to have the highest recorded plasticity for any steel alloy, essentially the highest threshold at which a material can withstand an impact without deforming permanently. The alloy can withstand pressure and stress of up to without permanent deformation. This is the highest impact resistance of any bulk metallic glass ever recorded . This makes it as an attractive option for armour material and other applications that require high stress tolerance.

== Additive manufacturing ==
One challenge when synthesising a metallic glass is that the techniques often only produce very small samples, due to the need for high cooling rates. 3D-printing methods have been suggested as a method to create larger bulk samples. Selective laser melting (SLM) is one example of an additive manufacturing method that has been used to make iron based metallic glasses. Laser foil printing (LFP) is another method where foils of the amorphous metals are stacked and welded together, layer by layer.

==Modeling and theory==
Bulk metallic glasses have been modeled using atomic scale simulations (within the density functional theory framework) in a similar manner to high entropy alloys. This has allowed predictions to be made about their behavior, stability and many more properties. As such, new bulk metallic glass systems can be tested and tailored for a specific purpose (e.g. bone replacement or aero-engine component) without as much empirical searching of the phase space or experimental trial and error. Ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirmed that the atomic surface structure of a Ni-Nb metallic glass observed by scanning tunneling microscopy is a kind of spectroscopy. At negative applied bias it visualizes only one soft of atoms (Ni) owing to the structure of electronic density of states calculated using ab-initio MD simulation.

One common way to try and understand the electronic properties of amorphous metals is by comparing them to liquid metals, which are similarly disordered, and for which established theoretical frameworks exist. For simple amorphous metals, good estimations can be reached by semi-classical modelling of the movement of individual electrons using the Boltzmann equation and approximating the scattering potential as the superposition of the electronic potential of each nucleus in the surrounding metal. To simplify the calculations, the electronic potentials of the atomic nuclei can be truncated to give a muffin-tin pseudopotential. In this theory, there are two main effects that govern the change of resistivity with increasing temperatures. Both are based on the induction of vibrations of the atomic nuclei of the metal as temperatures increase. One is, that the atomic structure gets increasingly smeared out as the exact positions of the atomic nuclei get less and less well defined. The other is the introduction of phonons. While the smearing out generally decreases the resistivity of the metal, the introduction of phonons generally adds scattering sites and therefore increases resistivity. Together, they can explain the anomalous decrease of resistivity in amorphous metals, as the first part outweighs the second. In contrast to regular crystalline metals, the phonon contribution in an amorphous metal does not get frozen out at low temperatures. Due to the lack of a defined crystal structure, there are always some phonon wavelengths that can be excited. While this semi-classical approach holds well for many amorphous metals, it generally breaks down under more extreme conditions. At very low temperatures, the quantum nature of the electrons leads to long range interference effects of the electrons with each other in what is called &quot;weak localization effects&quot;. In very strongly disordered metals, impurities in the atomic structure can induce bound electronic states in what is called &quot;Anderson localization&quot;, effectively binding the electrons and inhibiting their movement.

<doc id="347033" wikidata="Q4798484" url="?curid=347033" title="Arthur Donaldson">
<text>Arthur William Donaldson (13 December 1901 – 18 January 1993) was a Scottish journalist and Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. He was leader of the Scottish National Party from 1960 to 1969.

==Early years==
Donaldson was born in Dundee, the son of George Donaldson, a yarn dresser. He was educated at Harris Academy, leaving in 1917 with five Higher leaving certificate passes. After working as an assistant registrar of births, deaths and marriages in Dundee from 1918 to 1920, he began a career in journalism as a reporter with &quot;The Courier&quot;, a Dundee newspaper. In 1923, he decided to emigrate to the United States to try his hand as a journalist there. Donaldson did not find work as a journalist and instead found employment in Detroit, MI as secretary to the head of an engineering department in the automotive industry, then attended the Detroit Institute of Technology to study engineering. He eventually became assistant secretary in the Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s public procurement division, responsible for dealing with the United States Department of Defense.

Although now beginning to be established in the United States, Donaldson took a keen interest in the developing political movement for Scottish independence back home. To that end, in 1928 he joined the newly formed National Party of Scotland as an overseas member. In 1932, Donaldson married Violet &quot;Vi&quot; Bruce, another expatriate Scot (from Forfar) and they set up home in Washington D.C., where he continued to work for Chrysler. Donaldson joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934, and three years later returned to his native Scotland with his family, settling at Lugton, Ayrshire, where he established a poultry farm. In 1944, he moved to his wife&#x27;s native Forfar, where he worked in retail business and as a freelance journalist.

==Political career==
Donaldson came into contact with Robert McIntyre, one of the leading members of the SNP, and his involvement with the party deepened.

In May 1941, during the Second World War, Donaldson&#x27;s home was raided by the police, who suspected him and a number of other SNP figures of &quot;subversive activities&quot;, due to their support for the Scottish Neutrality League. An informant of MI5 told the desk officer Richard Brooman-White that in the event of a German invasion of Britain, Donaldson had told him that he intended to set up a puppet government akin to that of Vidkun Quisling in Norway. As a result of this information, Donaldson was arrested and interned under Defence Regulation 18B, sent first to Kilmarnock Prison and then to Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow. He was held for six weeks. An MI5 file, published in 2005, outlined how Donaldson had revealed to a close confidant - who was also a British agent - that a network of Nazi sympathisers was planning to undermine the war effort. His United Scotland Movement was said to be contemplating &quot;spreading confusion by false reports and minor acts of sabotage, and is in fact now endeavouring to start a whispering campaign to spread rumours, particularly of shipping losses&quot;. Donaldson was also recorded as saying that he believed a German invasion would be successful and that &quot;The movement in Scotland must then be able to show the German government that it is organised and has a clear-cut policy, that it is not with England in the war.&quot;

Donaldson remained a member of the SNP throughout the 1940s and 1950s, when it was particularly weak and much of the focus of nationalist efforts was being invested in the Scottish Covenant of John MacCormick. MacCormick had left the SNP in 1942, as he had been unable to persuade the party to adopt a position of supporting devolution rather than independence, a split which Donaldson himself had put down more to a personality clash than to ideological differences.

After the split of 1942, Donaldson became a leading SNP figure, along with McIntyre. Donaldson stood as SNP candidate for Dundee at the 1945 general election, coming bottom of the poll with 7,775 votes. In 1948 he moved to Forfar, where he soon became editor of the &quot;Forfar Dispatch&quot;. He became active in local government in Angus, as a member of Forfar Town Council from 1945 to 1968, and as the town treasurer. He also served as a member of Angus County Council from 1946 to 1955. These commitments meant that Donaldson was not active in the general elections of 1950, 1951, and 1955, but in 1959 he fought the Kinross and Western Perthshire constituency.

==Leadership==
Donaldson became SNP leader in June 1960, when he was elected unopposed, replacing James Halliday, and it was during his term as SNP leader that the party began to grow and impose itself on the Scottish political landscape. An inspirational speaker, he enthused supporters, touring branches and constituencies, and the party&#x27;s growth in membership, branches, and votes throughout the decade was phenomenal. Donaldson was the SNP candidate opposing Sir Alec Douglas-Home in the Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election in November 1963, although he lost his deposit there. During his term of office the SNP began to perform credibly in elections, winning the 1967 Hamilton by-election, and polling more votes than any other party in the 1968 Scottish local authority elections. During his leadership, Donaldson stood as SNP parliamentary candidate for Kinross and Western Perthshire at the 1964 and 1966 general elections.

This success, however, did not leave Donaldson without his critics, and at the 1967 SNP Annual Conference he faced a leadership challenge from Douglas Drysdale, which he comfortably defeated. In January 1969, Donaldson announced his intention to stand down from the SNP leadership. It was felt by a large number of party members that the SNP needed someone younger than Donaldson (then 68 years old) to lead the party. However, following a number of requests from SNP branches and members that he reconsider his decision to resign so close to a forthcoming general election, he decided to put himself forward for re-nomination as leader at the 1969 SNP Annual National Conference. At conference in June of that year, the SNP&#x27;s deputy leader, William Wolfe, was elected as leader by 544 votes to 238 for Donaldson.

He stood as SNP parliamentary candidate for Galloway at the 1970 general election, coming second. Donaldson remained active in the SNP at branch, constituency, and national level well into his eighties.

He died on 18 January 1993 at Forfar, aged 91.

<doc id="347034" wikidata="Q15526902" url="?curid=347034" title="John Wesley Harding (singer)">
<text>Wesley Stace (born 22 October 1965) is an English folk/pop singer-songwriter and author who has used the stage name John Wesley Harding. Under his legal name, he has written four novels. He is also an occasional university teacher and the curator of Wesley Stace&#x27;s Cabinet of Wonders.

==Early life==
Stace was born in Hastings, East Sussex, England, the son of educators Christopher Stace and Molly Townson. His mother was also an opera singer and for many years was the director of the Hastings Musical Festival. His sister, Melanie Stace, is a performing artist. His given name, Wesley, comes from John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, who preached one of his last sermons near the town where Harding was born. As a child, he taught himself how to play guitar and eventually starting writing his own songs as a teenager, citing John Prine, Loudon Wainwright III, and Bob Dylan as influences. His education included the boarding school St. Andrews School (Pangbourne, Berkshire); Milbourne Lodge (Claygate, Surrey); The King&#x27;s School Canterbury; and university at Jesus College, Cambridge. He left Cambridge with a First in English Literature, but left before completing his PhD in Social and Political Science to pursue a career in music. 

==Music career==
Stace began his musical career using the stage name John Wesley Harding, which he took from the 1967 Bob Dylan album &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;, for which Dylan misspelled the outlaw John Wesley Hardin&#x27;s name, adding a final &#x27;g&#x27;. He attracted notice after opening a concert for John Hiatt, leading him to sign with Demon Records, who released his critically acclaimed live album &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; in 1988. The success of the album led to a record deal with Sire Records, with whom he released &quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot; in 1990. The album featured members of The Attractions, and this association caused critics to frequently compare Stace to Elvis Costello for much of his career. He released &quot;The Name Above the Title&quot; and &quot;Why We Fight&quot; for Sire in 1991 and 1992 respectively, but despite critical acclaim and a strong cult following from his engaging live shows, he was not able to find a larger audience, leading Sire to drop him from the label. He continued to release music as John Wesley Harding throughout the 90s and early 2000s on various independent labels, including the song &quot;I&#x27;m Wrong About Everything&quot;, featured on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;High Fidelity&quot;. In 1995, he was chosen by Bruce Springsteen as his first opening act in 20 years for his solo shows at the Berkeley Community Theatre in 1995. In the mid 2000s he took a temporary hiatus from music to focus on his burgeoning writing career, returning in 2009 with &quot;Who Was Changed And Who Was Dead&quot;, a collaboration with The Minus 5. After 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of His Own Voice&quot;, he began releasing music under his given name, the most recent being 2021&#x27;s &quot;Late Style&quot;. 

&quot;John Wesley Harding&#x27;s Cabinet of Wonders&quot;, his series of variety shows, began in Spring 2009 in New York City at (Le) Poisson Rouge, before moving to City Winery, and has included appearances by Rosanne Cash, Graham Parker, Josh Ritter, Rick Moody, Colson Whitehead, Jonathan Ames, A.C. Newman, Rhett Miller, Steven Page, Eugene Mirman, Kristin Hersh, David Gates, John Roderick, Jon Auer, Tanya Donelly, Martha Plimpton, Todd Barry, Steve Almond, and Stephen Elliott. The spring 2010 series featured, among others, Sarah Vowell, Sondre Lerche, Buffalo Tom, Janeane Garofalo, Robbie Fulks, and Paul Muldoon. Artists in the series included Andrew Bird, Tift Merritt, and David Wax Museum. Podcasts of the series can be heard on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet of Wonders.&quot; and recently on Salon.com. Live shows continue in New York City and across the country.

==Writing career==
In 2005, Stace published his first novel, &quot;Misfortune&quot;, under his real name, based upon lyrics to his song &quot;Miss Fortune&quot; from his 1998 album &quot;Awake&quot;. It was nominated for the Guardian First Book Award, and shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Prize and the James Tiptree, Jr. Award. &quot;Misfortune&quot; was also chosen by Amazon.com as one of the Ten Best Novels of 2005, and was one of the Washington Post&#x27;s Books of the Year. &quot;Misfortune,&quot; translated as &quot;L&#x27;infortunée&quot;, became a best-seller in France, and has also been translated into many languages including Hebrew, Chinese, and Japanese. The movie rights to &quot;Misfortune&quot; were sold in 2008. His 2005 album &quot;Songs of Misfortune&quot; comprises songs written for, or appearing in, that book.

His second novel, &quot;By George&quot;, was published in August 2007; it was one of the New York Public Library&#x27;s &quot;Books To Remember&quot; of 2007, and Booklist Editor&#x27;s Choice for books of the year. A third, &quot;Charles Jessold, Considered as a Murderer&quot;, was published by Jonathan Cape in the UK in July 2010 and Picador in the United States in February 2011, and was one of the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s Top Ten Books of the Year. &quot;Wonderkid&quot;, his fourth novel, followed in 2014. He then worked with choreographer Mark Morris on his memoir &quot;Out Loud&quot;, which was released in 2019. 

Stace has reviewed for the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Other writings include chapbooks for some of his albums, and essays for various music publications from Creem to &quot;Raygun&quot;. His essay, &quot;Listerine: The Life and Opinions of Laurence Sterne,&quot; published in &quot;Post Road&quot; No. 5, was nominated for a Pushcart Prize.

==Personal life==
Stace has lived in the United States since 1991. He currently resides in Philadelphia with his wife Abbey, a visual artist. They have two children, Tilda and Wyn. In addition to his writing and music careers, Stace has also taught college courses about creative writing and songwriting at Swarthmore College, Princeton University, and Fairleigh Dickinson University.

<text>The SNP Trade Union Group (TUG) is a constituent structure and the largest affiliated organisation of the Scottish National Party (SNP). Formed in the mid to late 1960s as the Association of Scottish Nationalist Trade Unionists (ASNTU), the original goals of the organisation were to recruit members to the SNP in the trade union movement and attract Labour-voting trade unionists to Scottish independence. Refounded as the TUG in 2014 in the lead up to the independence referendum, membership grew from 800 in September of that year to 16,000 by July 2015.

==Representation in the SNP==

The TUG is allowed to send delegates to the SNP&#x27;s annual National Conference and to National Council meetings, and has one representative on the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee.

<text>Camirus or Kamiros (; ) or Cameirus or Kameiros (Κάμειρος) was a city of ancient Rhodes, in the Dodecanese, Greece. Its site is on the northwest coast of the island, west of the modern village of Kalavarda.

==History==
The ancient city was built on three levels. At the top of the hill was the acropolis, with the temple complex of Athena Kameiras and the stoa. A covered reservoir having a capacity of 600 cubic meters of water—enough for up to 400 families—was constructed about the sixth century BC. Later, the stoa was built over the reservoir. The stoa consisted of two rows of Doric columns with rooms for shops or lodgings in the rear.

The main settlement was on the middle terrace, consisting of a grid of parallel streets and residential blocks. On the lower terrace are found a Doric temple, probably to Apollo; the Fountain House, with the Agora in front of it; and Peribolos of the Altars, which contained dedications to various deities.

During the prehistoric period the area was inhabited by Mycenaean Greeks. The city itself was founded by the Dorians. The temple foundations were begun at least as early as the eighth century BC. The earthquake of 226 BC destroyed the city and the temple. The earthquake of 142 AD destroyed the city for the second time.

The Acropolis was excavated by Alfred Biliotti and Auguste Salzmann between 1859 and 1864. Many of the finds from their digs are now kept in the British Museum in London. In 1928 the Italian Archaeological School began a systematic excavation of the area together with restoration work which continued until the end of the Second World War.

<text>Cettia is a genus of small insectivorous songbirds (&quot;warblers&quot;) which make up the core of the newly recognized family Cettiidae. They were formerly placed in the Sylviidae, which at that time was a wastebin taxon for the warbler-like Sylvioidea. The range of this genus extends from Europe to southeast Asia.

The genus gets its name from the Cetti&#x27;s warbler, itself named after the 18th century Italian zoologist Francesco Cetti.

The cettiid or typical bush warblers share the lifestyle and related adaptations and apomorphies with &quot;Bradypterus&quot;, the other genus called bush warblers. However, &quot;Bradypterus&quot; is related to the grass warblers of &quot;Locustella&quot; and &quot;Megalurus&quot; and is more distant from &quot;Cettia&quot;. Both &quot;bush warbler&quot; genera are smallish birds well adapted to climbing among shrubbery. They are markedly long-tailed birds, at first glance somewhat reminiscent of wrens.

These are quite terrestrial birds, which live in densely vegetated habitats such as thick forest and reedbeds. They will walk away from disturbance rather than flush. The plumage similarities and skulking lifestyle makes these birds hard to see and identify.

Cettid bush warblers tend towards rich or greyish browns above and buffish or light grey tones below. They have little patterning apart from the ubiquitous supercilium. Altogether, they appear much like the plainer species among &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; marsh warblers in coloration. Megalurid bush warblers tend to be somewhat slimmer and have a very long and pointed tail, but are otherwise very similar.

== Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Cettia&quot; was erected in 1834 by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte to accommodate Cetti&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Cettia cetti&quot;). The specific epithet &quot;cetti&quot; had been chosen in 1820 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck to commemorate the Italian zoologist Francesco Cetti.

This genus and the genus &quot;Horornis&quot; have been split. Cetti&#x27;s warbler (&quot;C. cetti&quot;), the type species, seems close to the genus &quot;Tesia&quot; from Southeast Asia and neighboring regions. Species in the genus &quot;Horornis&quot;, such as the famous &quot;uguisu&quot; (鶯, Japanese bush warbler, &quot;H. diphone&quot;) and the brown-flanked bush warbler (&quot;H. fortipes&quot;) belong to a group that might include the aberrant broad-billed warbler (&quot;Tickellia hodgsoni&quot;). This latter species differs wildly in its gaudy colors but in habitus is a typical &quot;bush warbler&quot;.

<text>Bradypterus is a genus of small insectivorous songbirds (&quot;warblers&quot;) in the newly recognized grass warbler family (Locustellidae). They were formerly placed in the Sylviidae, which at that time was a wastebin taxon for the warbler-like Sylvioidea. The range of this genus extends through the warm regions from Africa around the Indian Ocean and far into Asia.

The locustellid bush warblers are related to the grass warblers of &quot;Locustella&quot; and &quot;Megalurus&quot;, but share lifestyle and related adaptations and apomorphies with bush warblers in the family Cettiidae. These belong to an older lineage of Sylvioidea. Both &quot;bush warbler&quot; genera are smallish birds well adapted to climbing among shrubbery. They are markedly long-tailed birds, at first glance somewhat reminiscent of wrens.

These are quite terrestrial birds, which live in densely vegetated habitats like thick forest and reedbeds. They will walk away from disturbance rather than flush. The plumage similarities and skulking lifestyle make these birds hard to see and identify.

Locustellid bush warblers tend towards greyish browns above and buffish or light grey tones below. They have little patterning apart from the ubiquitous supercilium. Altogether, they appear much like the plainer species among &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; marsh-warblers in coloration. Cettiid bush warblers tend to be somewhat more compact, with less pointed tails, but are otherwise very similar.

== Species ==
This genus has been recently revised. The Sri Lanka bush warbler is sometimes placed in this genus but is now placed in its own monotypic genus (&quot;Elaphrornis&quot;). Several other former members of this genus (e.g. the Chinese bush warbler) are now placed in &quot;Locustella&quot;. Victorin&#x27;s warbler is no longer a member of this genus or even the family Locustellidae, but is now placed in its own monotypic genus &quot;Cryptillas&quot; in the African warbler family Macrosphenidae.

The genus contains 12 species:
* Knysna warbler, &quot;Bradypterus sylvaticus&quot;
* Bangwa forest warbler, &quot;Bradypterus bangwaensis&quot;
* Barratt&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Bradypterus barratti&quot;
* Evergreen forest warbler, &quot;Bradypterus lopezi&quot;
* Cinnamon bracken warbler, &quot;Bradypterus cinnamomeus&quot;
* Grey emutail, &quot;Bradypterus seebohmi&quot;
* Brown emutail, &quot;Bradypterus brunneus&quot;
* Dja River scrub warbler, &quot;Bradypterus grandis&quot;
* Little rush warbler, &quot;Bradypterus baboecala&quot;
* White-winged swamp warbler, &quot;Bradypterus carpalis&quot;
* Grauer&#x27;s swamp warbler, &quot;Bradypterus graueri&quot;
* Highland rush warbler, &quot;Bradypterus centralis&quot;

<text>In algebra (in particular in algebraic geometry or algebraic number theory), a valuation is a function on a field that provides a measure of the size or multiplicity of elements of the field. It generalizes to commutative algebra the notion of size inherent in consideration of the degree of a pole or multiplicity of a zero in complex analysis, the degree of divisibility of a number by a prime number in number theory, and the geometrical concept of contact between two algebraic or analytic varieties in algebraic geometry. A field with a valuation on it is called a valued field.

== Definition ==
One starts with the following objects:
*a field and its multiplicative group &quot;K&quot;×,
*an abelian totally ordered group .
The ordering and group law on are extended to the set } by the rules
* for all ∈ ,
* for all ∈ .

Then a valuation of is any map

that satisfies the following properties for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;K&quot;:

* if and only if ,
*, with equality if &quot;v&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) ≠ &quot;v&quot;(&quot;b&quot;).

A valuation &quot;v&quot; is trivial if &quot;v&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;K&quot;×, otherwise it is non-trivial.

The second property asserts that any valuation is a group homomorphism on &quot;K&quot;×. The third property is a version of the triangle inequality on metric spaces adapted to an arbitrary Γ (see &quot;Multiplicative notation&quot; below). For valuations used in geometric applications, the first property implies that any non-empty germ of an analytic variety near a point contains that point. 

The valuation can be interpreted as the order of the leading-order term. The third property then corresponds to the order of a sum being the order of the larger term, unless the two terms have the same order, in which case they may cancel and the sum may have larger order.

For many applications, is an additive subgroup of the real numbers formula_1 in which case ∞ can be interpreted as +∞ in the extended real numbers; note that formula_2 for any real number &quot;a&quot;, and thus +∞ is the unit under the binary operation of minimum. The real numbers (extended by +∞) with the operations of minimum and addition form a semiring, called the min tropical semiring, and a valuation &quot;v&quot; is almost a semiring homomorphism from &quot;K&quot; to the tropical semiring, except that the homomorphism property can fail when two elements with the same valuation are added together.

===Multiplicative notation and absolute values===
The concept was developed by Emil Artin in his book &quot;Geometric Algebra&quot; writing the group in multiplicative notation as :

Instead of ∞, we adjoin a formal symbol &quot;O&quot; to Γ, with the ordering and group law extended by the rules
* for all ∈ ,
* for all ∈ .

Then a &quot;valuation&quot; of is any map

satisfying the following properties for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot;:

* if and only if ,
*, with equality if .

(Note that the directions of the inequalities are reversed from those in the additive notation.)

If is a subgroup of the positive real numbers under multiplication, the last condition is the ultrametric inequality, a stronger form of the triangle inequality , and is an absolute value. In this case, we may pass to the additive notation with value group formula_3 by taking .

Each valuation on defines a corresponding linear preorder: . Conversely, given a &quot;&quot; satisfying the required properties, we can define valuation }, with multiplication and ordering based on and .

===Terminology===
In this article, we use the terms defined above, in the additive notation. However, some authors use alternative terms: 
* our &quot;valuation&quot; (satisfying the ultrametric inequality) is called an &quot;exponential valuation&quot; or &quot;non-Archimedean absolute value&quot; or &quot;ultrametric absolute value&quot;;
* our &quot;absolute value&quot; (satisfying the triangle inequality) is called a &quot;valuation&quot; or an &quot;Archimedean absolute value&quot;.

===Associated objects===
There are several objects defined from a given valuation ;
*the value group or valuation group = &quot;v&quot;(&quot;K&quot;×), a subgroup of (though &quot;v&quot; is usually surjective so that = );
*the valuation ring &quot;Rv&quot; is the set of &quot;a&quot; ∈ with &quot;v&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) ≥ 0,
*the prime ideal &quot;mv&quot; is the set of &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot; with &quot;v&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) &gt; 0 (it is in fact a maximal ideal of &quot;Rv&quot;),
*the residue field &quot;kv&quot; = &quot;Rv&quot;/&quot;mv&quot;,
*the place of associated to &quot;v&quot;, the class of &quot;v&quot; under the equivalence defined below.

==Basic properties==

=== Equivalence of valuations ===
Two valuations &quot;v&quot;1 and &quot;v&quot;2 of with valuation group Γ1 and Γ2, respectively, are said to be equivalent if there is an order-preserving group isomorphism such that &quot;v&quot;2(&quot;a&quot;) = φ(&quot;v&quot;1(&quot;a&quot;)) for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;K&quot;×. This is an equivalence relation.

Two valuations of &quot;K&quot; are equivalent if and only if they have the same valuation ring.

An equivalence class of valuations of a field is called a place. &quot;Ostrowski&#x27;s theorem&quot; gives a complete classification of places of the field of rational numbers formula_4 these are precisely the equivalence classes of valuations for the &quot;p&quot;-adic completions of formula_5

=== Extension of valuations===
Let &quot;v&quot; be a valuation of and let &quot;L&quot; be a field extension of . An extension of &quot;v&quot; (to &quot;L&quot;) is a valuation &quot;w&quot; of &quot;L&quot; such that the restriction of &quot;w&quot; to is &quot;v&quot;. The set of all such extensions is studied in the ramification theory of valuations.

Let &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; be a finite extension and let &quot;w&quot; be an extension of &quot;v&quot; to &quot;L&quot;. The index of Γ&quot;v&quot; in Γ&quot;w&quot;, e(&quot;w&quot;/&quot;v&quot;) = [Γ&quot;w&quot; : Γ&quot;v&quot;], is called the reduced ramification index of &quot;w&quot; over &quot;v&quot;. It satisfies e(&quot;w&quot;/&quot;v&quot;) ≤ [&quot;L&quot; : &quot;K&quot;] (the degree of the extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;). The relative degree of &quot;w&quot; over &quot;v&quot; is defined to be &quot;f&quot;(&quot;w&quot;/&quot;v&quot;) = [&quot;Rw&quot;/&quot;mw&quot; : &quot;Rv&quot;/&quot;mv&quot;] (the degree of the extension of residue fields). It is also less than or equal to the degree of &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;. When &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is separable, the ramification index of &quot;w&quot; over &quot;v&quot; is defined to be e(&quot;w&quot;/&quot;v&quot;)&quot;pi&quot;, where &quot;pi&quot; is the inseparable degree of the extension &quot;Rw&quot;/&quot;mw&quot; over &quot;Rv&quot;/&quot;mv&quot;.

=== Complete valued fields ===
When the ordered abelian group is the additive group of the integers, the associated valuation is equivalent to an absolute value, and hence induces a metric on the field . If is complete with respect to this metric, then it is called a complete valued field. If &quot;K&quot; is not complete, one can use the valuation to construct its completion, as in the examples below, and different valuations can define different completion fields.

In general, a valuation induces a uniform structure on , and is called a complete valued field if it is complete as a uniform space. There is a related property known as spherical completeness: it is equivalent to completeness if formula_6 but stronger in general.

== Examples ==

===p-adic valuation===
The most basic example is the -adic valuation ν&quot;p&quot; associated to a prime integer &quot;p&quot;, on the rational numbers formula_7 with valuation ring formula_8 where formula_9 is the localization of formula_10 at the prime ideal formula_11. The valuation group is the additive integers formula_12 For an integer formula_13 the valuation ν&quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) measures the divisibility of &quot;a&quot; by powers of &quot;p&quot;:

:formula_14

and for a fraction, ν&quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot;) = ν&quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) − ν&quot;p&quot;(&quot;b&quot;).

Writing this multiplicatively yields the -adic absolute value, which conventionally has as base formula_15, so formula_16.

The completion of formula_17 with respect to ν&quot;p&quot; is the field formula_18 of p-adic numbers.

===Order of vanishing===
Let K = F(x), the rational functions on the affine line X = F1, and take a point &quot;a&quot; ∈ X. For a polynomial formula_19 with formula_20, define &quot;v&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = k, the order of vanishing at &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;; and &quot;v&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;f&quot; /&quot;g&quot;) = &quot;v&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) − &quot;v&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;g&quot;). Then the valuation ring &quot;R&quot; consists of rational functions with no pole at &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;, and the completion is the formal Laurent series ring F((&quot;x&quot;−&quot;a&quot;)). This can be generalized to the field of Puiseux series &quot;K&quot; (fractional powers), the Levi-Civita field (its Cauchy completion), and the field of Hahn series, with valuation in all cases returning the smallest exponent of &quot;t&quot; appearing in the series.

=== -adic valuation ===
Generalizing the previous examples, let be a principal ideal domain, be its field of fractions, and be an irreducible element of . Since every principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain, every non-zero element &quot;a&quot; of can be written (essentially) uniquely as

:formula_21

where the &quot;e&quot;&#x27;s are non-negative integers and the &quot;pi&quot; are irreducible elements of that are not associates of . In particular, the integer &quot;ea&quot; is uniquely determined by &quot;a&quot;.

The π-adic valuation of &quot;K&quot; is then given by
*formula_22
*formula_23
If π&#x27; is another irreducible element of such that (π&#x27;) = (π) (that is, they generate the same ideal in &quot;R&quot;), then the π-adic valuation and the π&#x27;-adic valuation are equal. Thus, the π-adic valuation can be called the &quot;P&quot;-adic valuation, where &quot;P&quot; = (π).

=== &quot;P&quot;-adic valuation on a Dedekind domain===
The previous example can be generalized to Dedekind domains. Let be a Dedekind domain, its field of fractions, and let &quot;P&quot; be a non-zero prime ideal of . Then, the localization of at &quot;P&quot;, denoted &quot;RP&quot;, is a principal ideal domain whose field of fractions is . The construction of the previous section applied to the prime ideal &quot;PRP&quot; of &quot;RP&quot; yields the -adic valuation of .

==Vector spaces over valuation fields==
Suppose that ∪ {0} is the set of non-negative real numbers under multiplication. Then we say that the valuation is non-discrete if its range (the valuation group) is infinite (and hence has an accumulation point at 0).

Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is a vector space over &quot;K&quot; and that &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are subsets of &quot;X&quot;. Then we say that A&quot; absorbs &quot;B if there exists a &quot;α&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot; such that &quot;λ&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot; and &quot;|λ| ≥ |α|&quot; implies that &quot;B ⊆ λ A&quot;. &quot;A&quot; is called radial or absorbing if &quot;A&quot; absorbs every finite subset of &quot;X&quot;. Radial subsets of &quot;X&quot; are invariant under finite intersection. Also, &quot;A&quot; is called circled if &quot;λ&quot; in &quot;K&quot; and &quot;|λ| ≥ |α|&quot; implies &quot;λ A ⊆ A&quot;. The set of circled subsets of &quot;L&quot; is invariant under arbitrary intersections. The circled hull of &quot;A&quot; is the intersection of all circled subsets of &quot;X&quot; containing &quot;A&quot;.

Suppose that &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are vector spaces over a non-discrete valuation field &quot;K&quot;, let &quot;A ⊆ X&quot;, &quot;B ⊆ Y&quot;, and let &quot;f : X → Y&quot; be a linear map. If &quot;B&quot; is circled or radial then so is formula_24. If &quot;A&quot; is circled then so is &quot;f(A)&quot; but if &quot;A&quot; is radial then &quot;f(A)&quot; will be radial under the additional condition that &quot;f&quot; is surjective.

<doc id="347059" wikidata="Q1446138" url="?curid=347059" title="Extensor hallucis longus muscle">
<text>The extensor hallucis longus muscle is a thin skeletal muscle, situated between the tibialis anterior and the extensor digitorum longus. It extends the big toe and dorsiflects the foot. It also assists with foot eversion and inversion.

== Structure ==
The muscle ends as a tendon of insertion. The tendon passes through a distinct compartment in the inferior extensor retinaculum of foot. It crosses anterior tibial vessels lateromedially near the bend of the ankle. In the foot, its tendon is situated at along the medial side of the dorsum of the foot. Opposite the metatarsophalangeal articulation, the tendon gives off a thin prolongation on either side, to cover the surface of the joint. An expansion from the medial side of the tendon is usually inserted into the base of the proximal phalanx.

=== Origin ===
The extensor hallucis longus muscle arises from the middle portion of the anterior surface of the fibula and adjacent interosseous membrane of the leg. Its origin is medial to the origin of the extensor digitorum longus muscle.

=== Insertion ===
The muscle inserts at the base of the distal phalanx of the great toe.

===Nerve supply===
The muscle receives motor innervation from the deep fibular nerve (L5) (a branch of common fibular nerve).

=== Relations ===
The anterior tibial vessels and deep fibular nerve pass between this muscle and the tibialis anterior muscle.

===Variation===
Occasionally united at its origin with the extensor digitorum longus.

The extensor ossis metatarsi hallucis, a small muscle, sometimes found as a slip from the extensor hallucis longus, or from the tibialis anterior, or from the extensor digitorum longus, or as a distinct muscle; it traverses the same compartment of the transverse ligament with the extensor hallucis longus.

=== Actions/movements ===
The muscle extends/dorsiflects the big toe (primary action), and dorsiflects the foot (secondary action).

<doc id="347060" wikidata="Q2746450" url="?curid=347060" title="Chip's Challenge">
<text>Chip&#x27;s Challenge is a top-down tile-based puzzle video game originally published in 1989 by Epyx as a launch title for the Atari Lynx. It was later ported to several other systems and was included in the Windows 3.1 bundle &quot;Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4&quot; (1992), and the Windows version of the &quot;Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack&quot; (1995), where it found a much larger audience.

The original game was designed by developer Chuck Sommerville, who also made about a third of the levels. Most of the conversions from the Atari Lynx original to other formats were carried out by Images Software in the UK.

The game was re-released on Steam on May 28, 2015, along with a sequel, Chip&#x27;s Challenge 2, which was also designed by Sommerville.

==Gameplay==

The premise of the game is that high-school nerd Chip McCallahan has met Melinda the Mental Marvel in the school science laboratory and must navigate through Melinda&#x27;s &quot;Clubhouse&quot;, a series of increasingly difficult puzzles, in order to prove himself and gain membership to the very exclusive Bit Busters Club.

&quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; consists of a series of 148 two-dimensional levels (149 in Microsoft&#x27;s version) which feature the player character, Nerdy Chip McCallahan, often called just Chip, and various game elements such as computer chips, buttons, locked doors, water and lethal monsters. Gameplay involves using arrow keys, numeric keypad or mouse to move Chip about each of the levels in turn, collecting enough chips to open the chip socket at the end of each level, get to the exit, and move on to the next level.

While the same set of rules applies to each level, there are many different kinds of levels. Some are action-oriented and some are puzzle-oriented. Most levels have a time limit. Levels may include block-pushing puzzles (similar to &quot;Sokoban&quot;), dodging enemies, and moving through mazes. Levels can be skipped by entering an appropriate four-letter non-case-sensitive password. For the PC versions, game progress is automatically saved. If the player has a lot of trouble with a level, the game gives the option to skip to the next level. Progress is measured in terms of completed levels and player score, which is a sum of the scores obtained on each level. Level scores for timed levels can be improved by quickly completing the level, and scores on all levels can be improved by using fewer attempts to complete the level.

==Development==
In 1989, Sommerville led a team of programmers at Epyx to write &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; for Atari Lynx during a ten-week period shortly before the system&#x27;s launch. Sommerville had developed a crude prototype of the game on an Apple II to develop the game&#x27;s logic and to demonstrate to Epyx that it would be fun. Sommerville designed about a third of the levels, Bill Darrah designed another third, and the rest were developed by other Epyx staff.

&quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; was ported to several other systems, including the Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, MS-DOS, and Windows. Most of the conversions from the Atari Lynx original to other formats were carried out by Images Software in the UK, except for the Microsoft Windows version.

Microsoft licensed &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; from Epyx for a Windows 3.1 version of the game, developed by Microsoft under the direction of Tony Garcia. It was coded by Tony Krueger, with artwork by Ed Halley. Entering &quot;TONY&quot; as a password will bring the player to a level that credits the &quot;WEP 4 test team&quot; in the hint for that level and also contains different tiles that spell out developer names, including Doug T., Rob D., Ed H., and Lisa F. According to Doug, a former roommate of Krueger&#x27;s and one of the testers for the game, it was written in a single summer.

The Microsoft version was included in the fourth &quot;Microsoft Entertainment Pack&quot; and &quot;Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack&quot;. This version had significantly different sound and graphics, but became very popular due to the success of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack. The sequel, &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge 2&quot; would be based on this version.

BBS and early Internet forums dedicated to the Microsoft version allowed users to share home-made level editors and unofficial expansion packs, which was an early example of software modding.

==Reception==
&quot;STart&quot;″s Clayton Walnum remarked, &quot;If there&#x27;s one game that will sell Lynxes, &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; is it.&quot; He applauded the consistently high quality of the puzzles, saying that each one is &quot;a visual and intellectual delight.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; a casual game with &quot;a set of addicting, puzzle solving levels ... a quick fix for testing the acceleration speed of one&#x27;s brain&quot;.

&quot;The One&quot; reviewed the Amiga version of &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; in 1990, giving it an overall score of 88%, and expressing that while &quot;It might not look or sound like much, but &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; packs a very addictive punch. The iconic graphics are colorful but little more than functional, and the musical accompaniment is inoffensive if endlessly repetitive – but in this game, frills don&#x27;t count.&quot; &quot;The One&quot; praises &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; gameplay, calling it &quot;a puzzle player&#x27;s dream&quot;, expressing that the game&#x27;s puzzles require &quot;quick thinking&quot; and &quot;experimentation&quot;, and further praises their difficulty.

==Legacy==
Prompted by the popularity of the Microsoft releases, Sommerville created a sequel, &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge 2&quot;, in 1999. Sommerville was unable to release it independently, as the trademark was owned by Bridgestone Multimedia Group. Bridgestone, a Christian publishing company, had purchased Epyx&#x27;s assets when that company folded in order to acquire Bible software produced by the company. Bridgestone had little experience with the video game industry, and required that Sommerville pay a six-figure fee for the right to publish the game, which was not consistent with industry norms. Sommerville resumed negotiations in 2010 and, after five years, Bridgestone and Sommerville&#x27;s company Niffler released &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge 2&quot; via Steam on May 28, 2015, alongside a Steam release of the original game and a level editor.

During the negotiation period, Sommerville&#x27;s company Niffler also developed other similar puzzle games. &quot;Chuck&#x27;s Challenge&quot; was released in 2012 for iOS systems from the iTunes Store. The game was later licensed by Cartoon Network as the basis for a series of official &quot;Ben 10&quot; games called &quot;Ben 10 Game Generator&quot;.

&quot;Chuck&#x27;s Challenge 3D&quot; (2014) was funded through Kickstarter, and released for Windows, Mac, and Linux on Steam, and for Android on Google Play. The game was also a launch title for the Nvidia Shield.

<doc id="347068" wikidata="Q322188" url="?curid=347068" title="Rumpelstiltskin">
<text>&quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; ( ; ) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm in the 1812 edition of &quot;Children&#x27;s and Household Tales&quot;. The story is about an imp who spins straw into gold in exchange for a woman&#x27;s firstborn child.

== Plot ==
In order to appear superior, a miller brags to the king and people of his kingdom by claiming his daughter can spin straw into gold. The king calls for the girl, locks her up in a tower room filled with straw and a spinning wheel, and demands she spin the straw into gold by morning or he will have her killed. When she has given up all hope, a little imp-like man appears in the room and spins the straw into gold in return for her necklace of glass beads. The next morning the king takes the girl to a larger room filled with straw to repeat the feat, and the imp once again spins, in return for the girl&#x27;s glass ring. On the third day the girl is taken to an even larger room filled with straw, and told by the king that if she can spin all this straw into gold he will marry her, but if she cannot she will be executed. While she is sobbing alone in the room, the little imp appears again and promises that he can spin the straw into gold for her, but the girl tells him she has nothing left with which to pay. The strange creature suggests she pay him with her first child. She reluctantly agrees, and he sets about spinning the straw into gold.

The king keeps his promise to marry the miller&#x27;s daughter. But when their first child is born, the imp returns to claim his payment. She offers him all the wealth she has to keep the child, but the imp has no interest in her riches. He finally agrees to give up his claim to the child if she can guess his name within three days.

The queen&#x27;s many guesses fail. But before the final night, she wanders into the woods searching for him and comes across his remote mountain cottage and watches, unseen, as he hops about his fire and sings. He reveals his name in his song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;tonight tonight, my plans I make, tomorrow tomorrow, the baby I take. The queen will never win the game, for Rumpelstiltskin is my name&quot;.

When the imp comes to the queen on the third day, after first feigning ignorance, she reveals his name, Rumpelstiltskin, and he loses his temper at the loss of their bargain. Versions vary about whether he accuses the devil or witches of having revealed his name to the queen. In the 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tales, Rumpelstiltskin then &quot;ran away angrily, and never came back&quot;. The ending was revised in an 1857 edition to a more gruesome ending wherein Rumpelstiltskin &quot;in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two&quot;. Other versions have Rumpelstiltskin driving his right foot so far into the ground that he creates a chasm and falls into it, never to be seen again. In the oral version originally collected by the Brothers Grimm, Rumpelstiltskin flies out of the window on a cooking ladle.

== History ==
According to researchers at Durham University and the NOVA University Lisbon, the origins of the story can be traced back to around 4,000 years ago. A possible early literary reference to the tale appears in Dionysius of Halicarnassus&#x27;s &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;, in the 1st century AD.

== Variants ==



The same story pattern appears in numerous other cultures: &quot;Tom Tit Tot&quot; in the United Kingdom (from &quot;English Fairy Tales&quot;, 1890, by Joseph Jacobs); &quot;Whuppity Stoorie&quot; in Scotland (from Robert Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Popular Rhymes of Scotland&quot;, 1826); &quot;Gilitrutt&quot; in Iceland; and &quot;The Lazy Beauty and her Aunts&quot; in Ireland (from &quot;&quot;, 1870 by Patrick Kennedy), though subsequent research has revealed an earlier published version called &quot;The White Hen&quot; by Ellen Fitzsimon. 

The story also appears as جعيدان (&quot;Joaidane&quot; &quot;He who talks too much&quot;) in Arabic; Хламушка (&quot;Khlamushka&quot; &quot;Junker&quot;) in Russia; &quot;Rumplcimprcampr&quot;, &quot;Rampelník&quot; or &quot;Martin Zvonek&quot; in the Czech Republic; &quot;Martinko Klingáč&quot; in Slovakia; &quot;Cvilidreta&quot; in Croatia; &quot;Ruidoquedito&quot; (&quot;Little noise&quot;) in South America; &quot;Pancimanci&quot; in Hungary (from 1862 folktale collection by László Arany); &quot;Daiku to Oniroku&quot; (大工と鬼六 &quot;The carpenter and the ogre&quot;) in Japan and &quot;Myrmidon&quot; in France.

An earlier literary variant in French was penned by Mme. L&#x27;Héritier, titled &quot;Ricdin-Ricdon&quot;. A version of it exists in the compilation &quot;Le Cabinet des Fées&quot;, Vol. XII. pp. 125–131.

The Cornish tale of Duffy and the Devil plays out an essentially similar plot featuring a &quot;devil&quot; named &quot;Terry-top&quot;.

All these tales are classified in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index as tale type ATU 500, &quot;The Name of the Supernatural Helper&quot;. According to scholarship, it is popular in &quot;Denmark, Finland, Germany and Ireland&quot;.

== Name ==
&quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; is usually explained as literally meaning &quot;little rattle stilt&quot;. The ending &quot;-chen&quot; in the German form Rumpelstiltschen is a diminutive cognate to English &quot;-kin&quot;.

&quot;Rumpelstilzchen&quot; is regarded as containing , diminutive of &quot;stilt&quot;. This etymology seems endorsed by Hans-Jörg Uther&#x27;s handbook on the Grimms &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot;. Uther cites which gives the examples of , &quot;Wasserstelze&quot; (names of birds; stilt) as paralleling examples. However, this was not the etymology hinted at by Jacob Grimm.

Harry Rand&#x27;s book on this fairy suggests that &quot;Rumpel&quot; is not just a noise, but originally a crumpling noise, associated with shrunkenness and dwarfness, as apropos for the imp. So the name Rumpel-stilts is an oxymoronic juxtaposition, embodying the dichotomy of &quot;shortness-tallness&quot;. Succinctly it may also be rendered as &quot;crumpled stalk&quot;.

&quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable&quot; baldly and succinctly states it meaning as &quot;wrinkled foreskin&quot; or &quot;prepuce&quot;, which correlates with the &quot;crumpled stalk&quot; if stalk is considered as a euphemism.

Grimm suggested &quot;-stilt&quot;, &quot;-stiltchen&quot; from Old German &quot;stalt&quot; with some uncertainty, and did not much elaborate. Graff&#x27;s dictionary indicates that Rumpelstilts, or rather the form Rumpelstilz was corrupted phonetically towards &#x27; &#x27;haughtiness&#x27;, but the correct etymology points to &quot;stalt&quot; as Grimm suggested, and this goes to &quot; (1)&quot; meaning &quot;, location, place&quot; and meaning to &quot;set, place&quot;.

The meaning is similar to &quot;rumpelgeist&quot; (&quot;rattle-ghost&quot;) or &quot;poltergeist&quot; (&quot;rumble-ghost&quot;), a mischievous spirit that clatters and moves household objects. The name is believed to be derived from Johann Fischart&#x27;s &quot;Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua&quot; of 1577 (a loose adaptation of Rabelais&#x27;s &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;), which refers to an &quot;amusement&quot; for children, a children&#x27;s game named &quot;Rumpele stilt oder der Poppart&quot;. Thus a &quot;rumpelstilt&quot; or &quot;rumpelstilz&quot; was also known by such names as &quot;pophart&quot; or &quot;poppart&quot;, that makes noises by rattling posts and rapping on planks. (Other related concepts are &quot;mummarts&quot; or &quot;boggarts&quot; and &quot;hobs&quot;, which are mischievous household spirits that disguise themselves.)

=== Translations ===
Translations of the original Grimm fairy tale (KHM 55) into various languages have generally substituted different names for the dwarf whose name is &quot;&quot;. For some languages, a name was chosen that comes close in sound to the German name: &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; or &quot;Rumplestiltskin&quot; in English, &quot;Repelsteeltje&quot; in Dutch, &quot;Rumpelstichen&quot; in Brazilian Portuguese, &quot;Rumpelstinski&quot;, &quot;Rumpelestíjeles&quot;, &quot;Trasgolisto&quot;, &quot;Jasil el Trasgu&quot;, &quot;Barabay&quot;, &quot;Rompelimbrá&quot;, &quot;Barrabás&quot;, &quot;Ruidoquedito&quot;, &quot;Rompeltisquillo&quot;, &quot;Tiribilitín&quot;, &quot;Tremolín&quot;, &quot;El enano saltarín&quot; y &quot;el duende saltarín&quot; in Spanish, &quot;Rumplcimprcampr&quot; or &quot;Rampelník&quot; in Czech.

In Japanese, it is transcribed as , . The Russian name is close to the original German, , .

In other languages, the name was translated in a poetic and approximate way. Thus &quot;Rumpelstilzchen&quot; is known as &quot;Päronskaft&quot; (literally &quot;Pear-stalk&quot;) or &quot;Bullerskaft&quot; (literally &quot;Rumble-stalk&quot;) in Swedish, where the sense of &quot;stilt&quot; or &quot;stalk&quot; of the second part is retained.

Slovak translations use &quot;Martinko Klingáč&quot;. Polish translations use &quot;Titelitury&quot; (or &quot;Rumpelsztyk&quot;) and Finnish ones &quot;Tittelintuure&quot;, &quot;Rompanruoja&quot; or &quot;Hopskukkeli&quot;. The Hungarian name is Tűzmanócska and in Serbo-Croatian &quot;Cvilidreta&quot; (&quot;Whine-screamer&quot;). The Slovenian translation uses &quot;Špicparkeljc&quot; (&quot;Pointy-Hoof&quot;).

In Italian, the creature is usually called &quot;Tremotino&quot;, which is probably formed from the world &quot;tremoto&quot;, which means &quot;earthquake&quot; in Tuscan dialect, and the suffix &quot;-ino&quot;, which generally indicates a small and/or sly character. The first Italian edition of the fables was published in 1897, and the books in those years were all written in Tuscan Italian.

For Hebrew, the poet Avraham Shlonsky composed the name , a compact and rhymy touch to the original sentence and meaning of the story, &quot;My-Adviser My-Midget&quot;, from , , &quot;adviser&quot;, and , , &quot;squat, dumpy, pudgy (about a person)&quot;), when using the fairy-tale as the basis of a children&#x27;s musical, now a classic among Hebrew children&#x27;s plays.

Greek translations have used Ρουμπελστίλτσκιν (from the English) or Κουτσοκαλιγέρης (&quot;Koutsokaliyéris&quot;), which could figure as a Greek surname, formed with the particle κούτσο- (&quot;koútso-&quot; &quot;limping&quot;), and is perhaps derived from the Hebrew name.

Urdu versions of the tale used the name &quot;Tees Mar Khan&quot; for the imp.

== Rumpelstiltskin principle ==
The value and power of using personal names and titles is well established in psychology, management, teaching and trial law. It is often referred to as the &quot;Rumpelstiltskin principle&quot;. It derives from a very ancient belief that to give or know the true name of a being is to have power over it. See Adam&#x27;s naming of the animals in Genesis 2:19-20 for an example.

In this version of the story, Rumpelstiltskin reveals that his mother sent him to camp every summer until he was 18. The miller&#x27;s daughter, who has her father, the king and the king&#x27;s loyal royal advisor help her guess the name of the &quot;weird, little man&quot;, recalls that &quot;a good mother always sews her kid&#x27;s name inside their clothes before sending them off to camp.&quot; Thus, the girl decides to check his clothing, and finds Rumpelstiltskin&#x27;s name inside.

* Rumpelstiltskin appears in &quot;Ever After High&quot; as an infamous professor known for making students spin straw into gold as a form of extra credit and detention. He deliberately gives his students bad grades in such a way they are forced to ask for extra credit.
* The cast of the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Rainbow&quot; acted out the story in a 1987 episode. Zippy played the title character, Geoffrey played the king, Rod played the miller, Bungle played the miller’s daughter, George played the baby, Jane played the maid, and Freddy played a peasant.
* The video game &quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot; has a similar format with the character of Doopliss inspired by Rumpelstiltskin, in which the player has to guess his name correctly, but can only do so by finding the &quot;p&quot; in a chest underground. This reference is more direct in the original Japanese version and other translations, in which the character is named &quot;Rumpel&quot;.

<text>A quadriga is a car or chariot drawn by four horses abreast and favoured for chariot racing in classical antiquity and the Roman Empire. The word derives from the Latin , a contraction of , from &#x27;: four, and&#x27;: yoke. In Latin the word is almost always used in the plural and usually refers to the team of four horses rather than the chariot they pull. In Greek, a four-horse chariot was known as .

The four-horse abreast arrangement in a &quot;quadriga&quot; is distinct from the more common four-in-hand array of two horses in the front plus two horses behind those.

&quot;Quadrigae&quot; were raced in the Ancient Olympic Games and other contests. They are represented in profile pulling the chariot of gods and heroes on Greek vases and in bas-relief. During the festival of the Halieia, the ancient Rhodians would sacrifice a &quot;quadriga&quot;-chariot by throwing it into the sea. The &quot;quadriga&quot; was adopted in ancient Roman chariot racing.

&quot;Quadrigas&quot; were emblems of triumph. Victory or Fame are often depicted as the triumphant woman driving it. In classical mythology, the &quot;quadriga&quot; is the chariot of the gods. The god of the Sun Helios, often identified with Apollo, the god of light, was depicted driving his &quot;quadriga&quot; across the heavens, delivering daylight and dispersing the night.

== Classical sculpture ==

Modern sculptural &quot;quadrigas&quot; are based on the four bronze Horses of Saint Mark or the &quot;Triumphal &quot;Quadriga&quot;&quot;, a set of equine Roman or Greek sculptures.
Their age is disputed. Originally erected in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, possibly on a triumphal arch, they are now in St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice. 

Venetian Crusaders looted these sculptures in the Fourth Crusade, which dates them to at least 1204, and placed them on the terrace of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica. In 1797, Napoleon carried the &quot;quadriga&quot; off to Paris. They were returned after Napoleon&#x27;s fall. Due to the effects of atmospheric pollution, the original &quot;quadriga&quot; was retired to a museum and replaced with a replica in the 1980s.

&quot;Quadrigae&quot; also appear on the frieze of the Libyco-Punic Mausoleum of Dougga, which dates to the 2nd century BC.
== Variations ==
Though &quot;quadrigae&quot; were usually drawn by horses, occasionally, other animals or mythological creatures were employed in spectacles and in art. Elephants were sometimes used to draw &quot;quadrigae&quot; in the Roman imperial period, and more frequently elephant &quot;quadrigae&quot; were depicted on coins and other official images. In art and sculpture, &quot;quadrigae&quot; ridden in by the gods were appropriate to their characters; Neptune&#x27;s &quot;quadriga&quot; was drawn, for example, by hippocampi (mythological sea-horses).
== Modern quadrigas ==
Some of the most significant full-size free-standing sculptures of &quot;quadrigas&quot; include, in approximate chronological order:
* 1793 – The Berlin &quot;Quadriga&quot; was designed by Johann Gottfried Schadow in 1793 as the &quot;Quadriga of Victory&quot;, perhaps as a symbol of peace, represented by the olive wreath carried by Victory. Located atop the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany, it was seized by Napoleon during his occupation of Berlin in 1806, and taken to Paris. It was returned to Berlin by Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher in 1814. Her olive wreath was supplemented with an Iron Cross. The statue suffered severe damage during the Second World War. The association of the Iron Cross with Prussian militarism convinced the Communist government of East Germany to remove this aspect of the statue after the war. The iron cross was restored after German reunification in 1990.
* – The Carrousel &quot;quadriga&quot; is situated atop the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris, France. The arch was built to commemorate the victories of Napoleon. The &quot;quadriga&quot; was sculpted by Baron François Joseph Bosio to commemorate the Restoration of the Bourbons. The restoration is represented by an allegorical goddess driving a &quot;quadriga&quot;, with gilded Victories accompanying it on each side.
* 1819–1829 – The &quot;quadriga&quot; on the General Staff Building on the Palace Square in Saint Petersburg
* 1828–1832 – The &quot;quadriga&quot; on the Alexandrinsky Theater, in Saint Petersburg
* c. 1841 – The Panther &quot;Quadriga&quot; on the Semperoper in Dresden
* 1845–1848 – The &quot;quadriga&quot; on top of Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen by Herman Wilhelm Bissen and Stephan Ussing
* c. 1850 – The &quot;quadriga&quot; on the Bolshoi, above the portico of the Bolshoi Theatre, designed by sculptor Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg 
* c. 1852 – The Siegestor (Victory Gate) in Munich is topped by a lion &quot;quadriga&quot; created by Martin von Wagner.
* 1868 – The &quot;quadriga&quot; on the ducal palace in Braunschweig was destroyed in 1944 during the Second World War. It was reconstructed in 2008 and is considered the largest one in Europe.
* 1888 – &quot;Quadriga&quot; de l&#x27;Aurora as part of the Font de la cascada that is in Parc de la Ciutadella, Barcelona. Erected by Josep Fontserè, with possible contributions by the young Antoni Gaudí.
* 1893 – &quot;Columbus Quadriga&quot; atop the Peristyle Building, World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, Daniel Chester French, sculpture 
* 1895 – The &quot;quadriga&quot; of Brabant, situated on top from Parc du Cinquantenaire (1880–1905). Constructed to mark the 50 years of Belgian Independence, in Brussels, Belgium, was built by Thomas Vinçotte and Jules Lagae.
* c. 1898 – Atop Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Arch at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, New York, lady Columbia, an allegorical representation of the United States, rides in a chariot drawn by two horses. Two winged Victory figures, each leading a horse, trumpet Columbia&#x27;s arrival. The sculptor was Frederick William MacMonnies.
* c. 1900 – Two &quot;quadrigas&quot; on the Grand Palais in Paris, the work of French sculptor Georges Récipon
* 1904 – &quot;Victory and Progress&quot;, horse-drawn chariots by J. Massey Rhind on the Wayne County Building in Detroit, Michigan, though each of the two chariots is drawn by three instead of the customary four horses.
* 1906 – &quot;Progress of the State&quot; at the Minnesota State Capitol is unique for being entirely covered in gold leaf, and is situated above a building entrance rather than a triumphal arch. It was sculpted by Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter.
* 1911–1935 – The Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II (Monument of Victor Emmanuel II, or &quot;Altare della Patria&quot; (Altar of the Nation), or &quot;Il Vittoriano&quot;) in Rome, Italy, features two statues of goddess Victoria riding on &quot;quadrigas&quot;.
* 1912 – The Wellington Arch &quot;Quadriga&quot; is situated atop the Wellington Arch in London, England. It was designed by Adrian Jones. The sculpture shows a small boy, the son of Lord Michelham, the man who funded the sculpture, leading the &quot;quadriga&quot;, with Peace descending upon it from heaven.
* 1919–1923 – The former Banco di Bilbao headquarters at no. 16 Calle de Alcalá in Madrid, now part of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, features two &quot;quadrigas&quot; on a commercial building. The building was designed by Ricardo Bastida, with the sculptor of the chariot Higinio Basterras, and other sculptures by Quentin de la Torre. The charioteers are helmeted men standing on the handrails of the chariots. Height to plinth: about .
* 1926 – The Palace of Justice in Rome, seat of the modern Supreme Court of Cassation, features a bronze &quot;quadriga&quot; by sculptor Ettore Ximenes.

* 2002 – The Warsaw&#x27;s Grand Theatre features a &quot;quadriga&quot; reflecting the original Antonio Corazzi&#x27;s 1833 plans for the building, but not commissioned and executed until 2002.

<doc id="347073" wikidata="Q2345990" url="?curid=347073" title="Seaham">
<text>Seaham ( ) is a seaside town in County Durham, England. Located on the Durham Coast, Seaham is situated south of Sunderland and east of Durham. The town grew from the late 19th century onwards as a result of investments in its harbour and coal mines. The town is twinned with the German town of Gerlingen.

== History ==

The original village of Seaham has all but vanished; it lay between St Mary&#x27;s Church and Seaham Hall (i.e. somewhat to the north of the current town centre). The parish church, St Mary the Virgin, has a late 7th century. The Anglian nave resembles the church at Escomb in many respects.

Until the early years of the 19th century, Seaham was a small rural agricultural farming community whose only claim to fame was that the local landowner&#x27;s daughter, Anne Isabella Milbanke, was married at Seaham Hall to Lord Byron, on 2 January 1815.
Byron began writing his &quot;Hebrew Melodies&quot; at Seaham and they were published in April 1815.
It would seem that Byron was bored in wintry Seaham, though the sea enthralled him.
As he wrote in a letter to a friend:
The marriage was short-lived, producing as its only child the mathematician Ada Lovelace, but it was long enough to have been a drain on the Milbanke estate. The area&#x27;s fortunes changed when the Milbankes sold out in 1821 to the 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, who built a harbour, in 1828, to facilitate transport of goods from locally encouraged industries (the first coal mine was begun in 1845). However, this harbour later proved inadequate to deal with the millions of tonnes of coal and the 6th Marquess commissioned engineers Patrick Meik and Charles Meik to reclaim land and extend and deepen the dock. It was officially opened in 1905. The harbour is of particular interest because it consists of a series of interconnecting locks, rather than the more typical two wall construction.

As early as 1823, the 3rd Marquess had approached the architect John Dobson with a view to his drawing up plans for a town to be built around the harbour. Dobson did so, but the planned approach foundered for lack of funds, and the town instead grew in a more piecemeal fashion. To begin with, the town was itself called Seaham Harbour (to differentiate it from the ancient village); in time, though, the settlement as a whole came to be known as Seaham.

In 1853 John Candlish built the Londonderry Bottleworks in the town. It was the largest glass bottle works in Britain and survived until 1921. Candlish went on to become mayor and, in 1868, Liberal MP for Sunderland. Waste glass from the bottleworks was dumped at sea and is now washed up as glass pebbles, known as sea glass, on local beaches.

In 1928, production started at the last town colliery to be opened, Vane Tempest. By 1992, however, all three pits (Dawdon Colliery, Vane Tempest Colliery and Seaham Colliery – known locally as &quot;the Knack&quot;) had closed, a process accelerated by the British miners&#x27; strike. The pit closures hit the local economy extremely hard.

Seaham Colliery suffered an underground explosion in 1880 which resulted in the loss of over 160 lives, including surface workers and rescuers.

Many local families were affected by the tragic loss of eight men and one boy in the &#x27;Seaham Lifeboat Disaster&#x27;, when the RNLI lifeboat, the &quot;George Elmy&quot;, foundered on 17 November 1962. To commemorate the event, the new coast road was named George Elmy Lifeboat Way.

== Governance and politics ==

An electoral ward with the same name exists. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 8419.

Seaham is part of the Easington parliament constituency and is currently represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom by Labour Member of Parliament, Grahame Morris, who has served since the 2010 general election.

== Education ==

Seaham has one secondary school, without a sixth-form, called Seaham High School (before 2016 known as Seaham School of Technology).

== Sport ==
Seaham&#x27;s main football team is Seaham Red Star F.C., formerly Seaham Colliery Welfare Red Star, located near Seaham&#x27;s Red Star park. The club plays in Northern League Division One.

Seaham has two cricket clubs, Seaham Harbour Cricket club, and Seaham Park Cricket Club. Both senior teams play in the North East Premier League

In the 2019-20 rugby season, Seaham RUFC were promoted from Durham/Northumberland 3 into Durham/Northumberland 2.

== Media coverage ==

The final scene of the 1971 film, &quot;Get Carter&quot;, was shot at Blackhall Rocks beach, which is down the coast from Seaham.

The rich mining history of the town was highlighted in the 2000 film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, which was set during the 1984–85 UK miners&#x27; strike in the fictional County Durham town of Everington but which displayed characteristics particular to East Durham pit communities such as Seaham and Easington Colliery.
Both towns feature as locations in the film, notably Dawdon Miners&#x27; Club, into which Elliot&#x27;s dad runs when he learns his son has won an audition at dance school.
Elliot&#x27;s &quot;angry dance&quot; scene takes place in Dawdon between Embleton Street and Stavordale Street West.

The opening scene in &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992) was filmed on Blast Beach, at Dawdon.
The town has also served as a location for the BAFTA nominated film &quot;Life For Ruth&quot; (1962) starring Janet Munro and Patrick McGoohan.

The town appeared in the BBC Three sitcom &quot;Live!Girls! present Dogtown&quot; which premiered on the channel in autumn 2006. According to the &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot; (11 February 1999), scenes from &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998) were also going to be filmed in Seaham, but government intervention moved production elsewhere.

According to Tom McNee&#x27;s 1992 portrait of the town &quot;The Changing Face of Seaham: 1928–1992&quot;, St. John&#x27;s parish church was used as the setting of a 1985 service recorded for BBC Radio 3. Also, a two-part Channel 4 documentary profiled the town in 1991.

== Landmarks ==

To the south, beside the road to Dalton-le-Dale, are the remains of Dalden Tower, comprising the ruins of a 16th-century tower and fragments of later buildings.

The harbour itself may be said to be the principal landmark of the nineteenth-century town; though the Londonderry Institute in Tempest Road (1853-5 by Thomas Oliver) with its monumental Greek-style portico provides something of a glimpse of the Marquess&#x27;s original vision for the town.
Of a slightly later date, the former Londonderry Offices on the sea front once served as headquarters for the mining and other businesses of the Londonderry family.
A statue of the 6th Marquess stands in the forecourt.
Also dating from an early stage in the town&#x27;s development is the town-centre church of St John, Seaham Harbour (1835–40).
For the very much older St Mary&#x27;s, Seaham, and its neighbour Seaham Hall, see above.

For just over a hundred years the harbour was towered over by a lighthouse on Red Acre Point, immediately to the north, designed by William Chapman. Erected in 1835, it displayed a fixed white light above a revolving red light (an unusual configuration, provided so as to distinguish it from the north pier light at Sunderland); both lights were displayed from the same tower, the upper being and the lower above mean sea level. The lighthouse was gas-lit, with an arrangement of third-order catadioptric lenses provided by Chance Brothers &amp; Co. It was decommissioned in 1905, when the harbour was expanded and the current black-and-white striped pier-head light was constructed. Red Acre lighthouse was left standing, however, to serve as a daymark, until 1940 when the whole structure was swiftly demolished in case it should serve to assist enemy navigators.

A steel statue, &quot;1101&quot; (locally also known as &quot;Tommy&quot;) by local artist Ray Lonsdale, commemorating World War One and initially erected temporarily for three months, was the subject of a local fund-raising drive in 2014 to retain it on the town&#x27;s seafront.

== Notable people==

Between 1929 and 1935, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Seaham (the defunct constituency which covered the area now renamed Easington) was Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.
Easington constituency has only ever returned Labour candidates to Parliament,
and at the 2010 General Election, Labour candidate Grahame Morris was elected with a majority of 14,982 votes.

Seaham has also produced several able footballers, some of whom have gone on to play for the local team, Sunderland, such as Richie Pitt and Gary Rowell. Terry Fenwick and Brian Marwood played for England, with the latter, on retirement from football, working as a commentator for Sky Sports. 
Paul Gascoigne also lived in Seaham in the late 1990s, while playing for Middlesbrough.

Other notable residents include:
* Baritone Sir Thomas Allen was born in Seaham in 1944
* Martin Brammer, musician
* Bob Fox, musician
* Elizabeth Sterling Haynes (born in Seaham in 1897), Canadian theatre activist
* Janie Jones, singer
* William McNally, Victoria Cross winner
* Ian Pattison, cricketer
* Agony aunt and author Denise Robertson lived in the town for many years
* Alex Russell, former professional footballer
* Peter Willey, Northamptonshire and England cricketer, went to Seaham Secondary School

<text>Lake Bracciano () is a lake of volcanic origin in the Italian region of Lazio, northwest of Rome. It is the second largest lake in the region (second only to Lake Bolsena) and one of the major lakes of Italy. It has a circular perimeter of approximately . Its inflow is from precipitation runoff and percolation, and from underground springs, and its outflow is the Arrone.

The lake owes its origin to intense volcanic and tectonic activity from 600,000 to 40,000 years ago, which created many small volcanoes in the &quot;Sabatino&quot; territory. The main magma chamber was situated under the present lake of Bracciano. Its collapse created the depressed area now occupied by the lake, which is not a crater lake. Some small craters and calderas are still recognisable around the lake and in the immediate vicinity (Martignano, Baccano, Sacrofano).

Three towns border the lake, Bracciano, Anguillara Sabazia and Trevignano Romano.

The lake is an important tourist attraction. As it serves as a drinking water reservoir for the city of Rome, it has been under control since 1986 in order to avoid pollution of its waters. The use of motorboats is strictly forbidden (exceptions being made for a few professional fishermen and the authorities), and a centralised sewer system has been built for all the bordering towns in order to avoid any spoiling of the water quality, making Bracciano one of the cleanest lakes in Italy. The absence of motorized navigation favours sailing, canoeing and swimming.

In the last few years, the lake and its surroundings have been brought under further protection by the creation of a regional park, the &quot;Parco Regionale del complesso lacuale di Bracciano Martignano&quot;.

Water from the hills above the lake was transported to Rome by the Aqua Traiana, dedicated in 109 CE. The aqueduct was restored in the early 17th century by Pope Paul V, taking water to the Trastevere area of Rome and (via the Ponte Sisto) to the Rione of Regola.

==History==
===La Marmotta Neolithic settlement===
At La Marmotta, a few hundred meters outside the village of Anguillara Sabazia, remains of an Early Neolithic lakeshore village, datable 5700 BC have been found, in works overseen by Maria Antonietta Fugazzola Delpino, director of the Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography in Rome, and president of the Italian Institute of Prehistory and Protohistory. Thick oak pilings driven more than two meters into the subsoil have survived, thanks to anoxic lake-bottom sediments; dendrochronology dates the settlement very accurately, for local tree-ring sequences have already been thoroughly established. The oldest post-Fugazzola Delpino has discovered at La Marmotta dates from around 5,690 BC, but she thinks ongoing work may yet reveal the village to have been born a century or so earlier. She is more certain of when it died: within a decade or so of 5230 BC. &quot;Since the sixth millennium BC, as the climate has grown wetter, the water level in Lake Bracciano has risen more than , and so the ruins of the Neolithic lakeshore village are now buried in bottom mud offshore&quot; (Delpino 2002).

The strongest evidence that the Marmottans came from far away, probably originally making their way along the Arrone to its source in Lake Bracciano, is simply that their culture was advanced. In the region around Lake Bracciano, according to Fugazzola Delpino, there is no sign of any but hunter-gatherers before the settlement was built at La Marmotta. The builders of the village had at their disposal, from the start, the entire &quot;Neolithic package&quot;: domesticated animals and plants, ceramic pots, polished stone tools, just as though they had unloaded all those things from their boats.

They kept sheep and goats; they brought pigs and cows with them too, and two breeds of dog, and they planted a wide variety of crops— wheat and barley — and collected others in the woods. &quot;They had everything&quot;, says Fugazzola, &quot;They ate grains, vegetables, and also lots of fruit – apples, plums, raspberries, strawberries&quot; Especially in winter they supplemented their diet with acorns, which they stored in large ceramic jars. They cultivated flax to make linen. They planted opium poppies&quot; One of their boats has been recovered. A team of Czech archaeologists built a copy of the boat and sailed it along the Mediterranean coast to test its seaworthiness.

===Roman Era===

The area around the lake was always sparsely populated, but by the late Republic many waterfront villas had been built. The rich volcanic soil and the beautiful environment and views attracted rich patricians from Rome to build elaborate &quot;villae rusticae&quot;. Among these, Domitian&#x27;s villa with thermal spa at Vicarello was the ultimate example.

However around the mid-1st century AD an environmental disaster occurred; the lake&#x27;s water level rose, flooding the shore and many of the villas there more or less permanently.

=== Legends ===
The lake was originally known as &quot;Lake Sabatine,&quot; named after the adjacent Sabatine Mountains and the ancient volcanic system in the area. It is believed that a prosperous city called &quot;Sabate&quot; once stood nearby. 

In the period between the 16th and 17th centuries, a German historian and geographer documented in &quot;Italia Antiqua&quot; that the lake&#x27;s calm waters occasionally revealed the submerged outlines of statues and edifices.

Legend has it that Sabate was a flourishing city whose residents, however, strayed from ethical principles. In response, a deity unleashed a devastating catastrophe that obliterated the city, sparing only a virtuous young woman. She was instructed by the deity to flee and not look back. Pausing to rest where the small church of St. Maria del Riposo would later be built, the woman eventually glanced back towards Sabate. However, in place of the city, she saw a vast lake, which came to be known as Lake Sabatine or Lago di Bracciano (Lake Bracciano.)

<doc id="347084" wikidata="Q3504878" url="?curid=347084" title="Murder of Adam Walsh">
<text>Adam John Walsh (November 14, 1974 July 27, 1981) was an American child who was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall in Hollywood, Florida, on July 27, 1981. His severed head was found two weeks later in a drainage canal alongside Highway 60/Yeehaw Junction in rural Indian River County, Florida. His death garnered national interest and was made into the 1983 television film &quot;Adam&quot;, seen by 38 million people in its original airing. 

Adam&#x27;s father, John Walsh, became an advocate for victims of violent crimes and was the host of the television program &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; and, later, &quot;In Pursuit with John Walsh&quot;. Convicted serial killer Ottis Toole confessed to Adam&#x27;s murder, but was never convicted of the crime because evidence was reportedly lost and Toole later recanted his confession. Toole died in prison of liver failure on September 15, 1996. No new evidence has come to light since then, and police announced on December 16, 2008, that the Walsh case was closed and that they were satisfied that Toole was the killer.

==Case history==
===Kidnapping and murder===
On the afternoon of July 27, 1981, Adam accompanied his mother Revé Drew on a shopping trip to the Hollywood Mall (today Hollywood Hills Plaza) in Hollywood, Florida (). They went to Sears, entering through the north entrance. Revé intended to inquire about a lamp that was on sale and left Adam at a kiosk with Atari 2600 video games on display, where several other boys were taking turns playing them. Revé completed her business in the lamp department around 12:15 pm. She said that she returned to find that Adam and the other boys had disappeared. A store manager informed her that a scuffle had broken out over whose turn it was at the kiosk, and a security guard demanded that the boys leave the store. The security guard asked the older boys if their parents were in the store, and they said that they were not. Adam&#x27;s parents later conjectured that their son had been too shy to speak to the security guard, who presumed that he was in the company of the other boys and made him leave by the same door by which the boys had entered (the Sears west entrance). His parents believe that after the other boys dispersed, he was left alone outside the store at an exit unfamiliar to him. Meanwhile, unable to find Adam in the toy department, Revé had him paged over the public address system and continued to look for him throughout the store. By coincidence, she ran into her mother-in-law Jean, who helped her search for him. After more than 90 minutes of searching and paging failed to locate Adam, Revé called the Hollywood Police at 1:55 pm.

On August 10, a severed head was found in a drainage canal alongside the Florida Turnpike near Vero Beach, almost from Hollywood, by detective Ralph E. Latimer Jr. and an unidentified deputy of the Indian River County sheriff&#x27;s office. Indian River County and St. Lucie County divers searched the canal. On the morning of August 11, John and Revé appeared on national television saying that they still hoped that Adam was alive. A reward was posted for Adam&#x27;s safe return. Soon after, the recovered remains were identified as Adam&#x27;s.

The coroner ruled that the cause of Adam&#x27;s death was asphyxiation. The state of the remains suggested that Adam had died several days before the discovery of his head. The rest of his body was never recovered. The head itself would be kept in the morgue until the case&#x27;s closure in 2008.

===Investigation===
John and Revé believed that the Hollywood police department had botched the treatment of Adam&#x27;s disappearance, first with the missing person investigation, and then with the murder investigation.

After some investigation, police eventually concluded that Adam was abducted by a drifter named Ottis Toole near the front exterior of Sears after being instructed to leave by a security guard. Toole said that he had lured Adam into his white 1971 Cadillac Sedan de Ville (which had a damaged right bumper) with promises of toys and candy, then proceeded to drive north on Interstate 95 toward his home in Jacksonville. According to Toole, Adam, at first docile and compliant, began to panic as they drove on. Toole punched him in the face, but as this just made the situation worse, he then &quot;walloped him unconscious.&quot; While Adam was unconscious, Toole drove north on the Florida Turnpike to a deserted service road just north of the Radebaugh Road overpass in northwest St. Lucie County (). When Toole realized that Adam was still breathing, he strangled him to death with a seat belt, dragged him out of the car and decapitated him with a machete. Toole also claimed to have incinerated the body in an old refrigerator when he returned to Jacksonville. He claimed that he wanted to make Adam his adopted son, but that was not deemed feasible. The source of the blood found in Toole&#x27;s car could not be identified. The police ultimately lost the bloodstained carpet from the car, the machete said to have been used to decapitate Adam and, eventually, the car itself. Toole, a confidant of convicted serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, repeatedly confessed and then retracted accounts of his involvement.

Toole was never charged in Adam&#x27;s case, although he provided seemingly accurate descriptions as to how he committed the crime. The 2019 Netflix miniseries &quot;The Confession Killer&quot; shows footage of him apparently being fed information from interrogators and he later confessed to several cases he had no involvement in. Several witnesses also placed him in the Hollywood area in the days leading up to Adam&#x27;s disappearance. In September 1996, he died in prison of cirrhosis at the age of 49 while serving a life sentence for other crimes. Later, his niece told John Walsh that he made a deathbed confession to Adam&#x27;s murder. His confession was viewed as unreliable, as he and Lucas confessed to or implicated themselves in more than 200 homicides. Most of Lucas&#x27; confessions were later revealed to have been false, having been coerced by the Texas Rangers.

In 1997, Hollywood police chief Rick Stone conducted an exhaustive review of Adam&#x27;s case after the release of John&#x27;s book. At the time, Stone was a 22-year veteran of the Dallas, Texas and Wichita, Kansas police departments and had been appointed Hollywood&#x27;s chief of police in the previous year. Although the crime happened 16 years before the time of his review, he provided an analysis of the evidence, including a review of taped interrogations of Toole by Hollywood detective Mark Smith. Stone says that his review found evidence &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that Toole murdered Adam. Stone noted that both Toole and Lucas were notorious for confessing to crimes that they had committed and then recanting.

In 2007, according to allegations that earned widespread publicity, Jeffrey Dahmer, who was arrested in Wisconsin in 1991 after killing more than a dozen men and boys, was also named as a suspect in Adam&#x27;s murder. Dahmer&#x27;s father called the &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; hotline soon after his son&#x27;s arrest to claim that he believed that his son was a pedophile. Dahmer was living in Miami Beach at the time of Walsh&#x27;s murder, and two eyewitnesses placed him at the mall on the day that Adam was abducted. One claimed to have seen a strange man walking into the toy department. The other said that he saw a young, blond man with a protruding chin throw a struggling child into a blue van and speed off. Both witnesses recognized the man they had seen as Dahmer when pictures of him were released in the newspapers after his arrest. Reports revealed that the delivery shop where Dahmer worked had a blue van at the time. He preyed on young men and boys (the youngest being eight years older than Adam), and his &quot;modus operandi&quot; included severing his victims&#x27; heads. When he was interviewed about Adam Walsh in 1992, Dahmer repeatedly denied his involvement in the crime, even stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve told you everything—how I killed them, how I cooked them, who I ate. Why wouldn&#x27;t I tell you if I did it to someone else?&quot; However it has been reported that Dahmer believed he would be killed in prison as a pedophile if he confessed to Walsh&#x27;s murder. After this rumor surfaced, John Walsh stated that he had &quot;seen no evidence&quot; linking Adam&#x27;s abduction and murder to those that were committed by Dahmer.

On December 16, 2008, Hollywood police chief Chad Wagner, with his friend John present, made the announcement that the case was now closed. An external review of the case had been conducted and police announced that they were satisfied that Toole was the murderer.

==Legacy==

=== Children found ===
The television film &quot;Adam&quot; premiered on October 10, 1983. The film was based on Walsh&#x27;s kidnapping and murder, and it attracted 38 million viewers on its first airing. Each of its three broadcasts in 1983, 1984 and 1985 were followed by pictures and descriptions of missing children. A hotline was also created to take calls that may have materialized into leads for investigators. The pictures and hotline were credited with finding 13 of the 55 children shown. American rapper Bizzy Bone, who was abducted by his stepfather as a child, was reunited with his mother after a babysitter recognized a photo of him during the broadcast.

=== Laws and organizations for missing children ===
In 1984, the U.S. Congress passed the Missing Children&#x27;s Assistance Act, owing in part to the advocacy of the Walshes and other parents of missing children. It allowed the formation of the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC).

The Code Adam program for helping lost children in department stores is named in Adam&#x27;s memory. The U.S. Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act on July 25, 2006, and President George W. Bush signed it into law on July 27. The signing ceremony took place on the South Lawn of the White House, attended by John and Revé. The bill institutes a national database of convicted child molesters, and increases penalties for sexual and violent offenses against children. It also creates a RICO cause of action for child predators and those who conspire with them.

The Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2016, which provides budgetary allotments to continue programs passed in the 2006 Act, was incorporated into H.R. 5578, the Survivors&#x27; Bill of Rights Act of 2016, and was enacted and signed by President Obama on October 7, 2016.

=== Societal impacts ===
The publicity that surrounded Adam&#x27;s case and the widely watched television movie &quot;Adam&quot; also created what was described as a mid-1980s panic over stranger abductions, one out of proportion to the actual numbers and that has persisted for decades. Richard Moran, a criminologist at Mount Holyoke College says: &quot;[The case] created a nation of petrified kids and paranoid parents. Kids used to be able to go out and organize a stickball game, and now all playdates and the social lives of children are arranged and controlled by the parents...the fear still lingers today.&quot; Early estimates by the NCMEC would state that as many as 20,000 children a year were abducted by strangers, and public service spots relayed the perceived danger. A 1986 Pulitzer Prize exposé discussed a &quot;numbers gap&quot; between the claimed number and other statistics, such as that the FBI investigated a total of 67 abductions by total strangers in 1984. By 1988, even as the NCMEC lowered annual estimates of stranger abductions by 80%, &quot;early estimates had a life of their own.&quot; A 1990 study of child abductions found that 99% of them were family-related. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of missing children ultimately killed decreased, partially attributed to the emergence of technologies such as mobile phones that allow calls for help.

<text>John Edward Walsh, Jr. (born December 26, 1945) is an American television presenter, criminologist, victims&#x27; rights activist, and the host/creator of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. He is known for his anti-crime activism, with which he became involved following the murder of his son, Adam, in 1981; in 2008, deceased serial killer Ottis Toole was officially named as Adam&#x27;s killer. Walsh was part-owner of the now defunct National Museum of Crime and Punishment in Washington, D.C. He also anchored an investigative documentary series, &quot;The Hunt with John Walsh&quot;, which debuted on CNN in 2014.

==Early life==
Walsh was born in Auburn, New York, one of four children born to John E. Walsh, Sr. and Jean Walsh. He graduated from Auburn&#x27;s Our Lady of Mount Carmel High School in 1963. He attended the University at Buffalo, from which he graduated in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. He married Revé Drew in 1971. After college, the Walshes settled in South Florida, where John became involved in building high-end luxury hotels.

==Murder of Adam Walsh==

In summer 1981, Walsh was an official with Paradise Island Hotel and Casino in The Bahamas, and worked in Hollywood, Florida. He and his wife, Revé, had a six-year-old son, Adam. On July 27, 1981, Adam was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall (today Hollywood Hills Plaza), across from the Hollywood Police station. Revé had left Adam in the toy department at a model video game console at the Sears while she looked for a lamp. When she returned several minutes later, Adam was missing. Police records in Adam&#x27;s case, released in 1996, show that a 17-year-old security guard instructed four boys to leave the department store. Adam is thought to have been one of them. Sixteen days after the abduction, his severed head was found in a drainage canal away from his home. The rest of his body was never found.

Many names had been mentioned in connection to the case since the murder, but detectives kept returning to that of serial killer Ottis Toole. John Walsh had long said he believed that Toole, a drifter, was responsible for the crime, saying investigators found a pair of green shorts and a sandal similar to what Adam was wearing at Toole&#x27;s home in Jacksonville, Florida. In January 2007, deceased serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer fell under suspicion for the murder of Adam. This speculation was discounted by Walsh in an &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; statement on February 6, 2007.

Toole, the prime suspect in Adam&#x27;s abduction and murder, died in prison in 1996 while serving a life sentence for other crimes. The Hollywood Police Department officially identified him as Adam&#x27;s killer on December 16, 2008, and the case was considered closed. Over the years, Toole had twice confessed to the killing, but both times he later recanted his admissions. In addition to the Walsh murder, Toole had claimed responsibility for hundreds of other murders, but police determined that most of these confessions were lies.

===Aftermath===
Following the crime, the Walsh family founded the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to legislative reform. The centers, originally located in West Palm Beach, Florida; Columbia, South Carolina; Orange County, California; and Rochester, New York; merged with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), where John Walsh serves on the board of directors.

The Walsh family organized a political campaign to help missing and exploited children. Despite bureaucratic and legislative problems, John&#x27;s and Revé&#x27;s efforts eventually led to the creation of the &quot;Missing Children Act of 1982&quot; and the &quot;Missing Children&#x27;s Assistance Act of 1984&quot;.

Today, Walsh continues to testify before Congress and state legislatures on crime, missing children and victims&#x27; rights issues. His latest efforts include lobbying for a Constitutional amendment for victims&#x27; rights.

The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act () was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on July 27, 2006, following a two-year journey through the United States Congress. It was intensely lobbied for by Walsh and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Primarily, it focuses on a national sex offender registry, tough penalties for failing to register as a sex offender following release from prison, and civilian access to state websites that track sex offenders. Critics argue that the system amounts to making offenders wear a lifelong &quot;Scarlet Letter&quot;, regardless of the circumstances of their cases.

By the late 1990s, many malls, department stores, supermarkets, and other such retailers had adopted what is known as a &quot;Code Adam&quot;, a movement first started by Walmart stores in the southeastern United States. A &quot;Code Adam&quot; is announced when a child is missing in a store or if a child is found by a store employee or customer. If the child is lost or missing, all doors will be locked and a store employee is posted at every exit, while a description of the child is generally broadcast over the intercom system. &quot;Code Adam&quot; as a term has become synonymous with a missing child, and is a predecessor to an &quot;Amber Alert&quot;, which serves as a system of broadcast-driven community notification.

==Career in television==
John and Revé Walsh were portrayed by actors Daniel J. Travanti and JoBeth Williams in &quot;Adam&quot;, a 1983 NBC television film dramatizing the days following Adam&#x27;s disappearance. The real Walshes appeared at the end of the broadcast to publicize photographs of other children who had vanished but were still missing. Later, a sequel called &quot;Adam: His Song Continues&quot; was produced and aired.
After securing a deal with Fox, Walsh launched &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; in 1988. By that time, Walsh was already well known because of the murder of his son and his subsequent actions to help missing and exploited children. &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; was the longest-running crime reality show in Fox&#x27;s history and contributed to the capture of more than 1,000 fugitives. Fox canceled the series in June 2011, but aired four specials during the 2011-12 season. On December 2, 2011, the series returned as a regular weekly first-run series on Lifetime. The last episode aired on October 12, 2012; five months later, in March 2013, Lifetime officially canceled the series.

Walsh also hosted his own daytime talk show, &quot;The John Walsh Show&quot;, which aired in syndication (mostly on NBC-owned and affiliated stations, as NBC produced the series) from 2002 to 2004. However, since &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; was still on the air at the time, he found it difficult to host both shows at the same time, so he asked then-NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker to release him from his contract. Zucker granted his request and cancelled &quot;The John Walsh Show&quot;.

In 2003, John Walsh assisted in solving the Kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart on an episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, where Ed Smart showed the picture of Brian David Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Emmanuel&quot; appearance. Mitchell&#x27;s stepchildren saw the episode, identified him, and called the show. This led to the rescue of Elizabeth Smart and the arrests of Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Ilene Barzee. After Elizabeth Smart was reunited with her family, Walsh later met Elizabeth after her family invited him to meet her and mentioned his hand in finding her.

In July 2005, Walsh attempted to assist the family of missing teen Natalee Holloway. Walsh was critical of the Aruban crime investigation and, along with television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, urged Americans to boycott Aruba. Walsh was a special guest on an episode of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; that aired on August 14, 2005. The episode visited the home of Colleen Nick, who is the parent of Morgan Nick, a six-year-old girl who has been missing since 1995. Walsh has featured the Morgan Nick case on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; several times.

Walsh&#x27;s life story was featured on &quot;The E! True Hollywood Story&quot; and &quot;Biography&quot;.

Walsh was later the host of &quot;The Hunt with John Walsh&quot;, a successor to &quot;AMW&quot;, which debuted on July 13, 2014 on CNN. &quot;The Hunt&quot; was in turn succeeded by &quot;In Pursuit with John Walsh&quot;, which premiered in January 2019 on Investigation Discovery.

On December 13, 2023, it was announced that Walsh would replace Elizabeth Vargas as host of the second season of the revival of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted,&quot; with his son Callahan Walsh as co-host. His return marks the first time Walsh has appeared on the show since its March 2013 cancellation. The show premiered on January 22, 2024, with Elizabeth Smart as a guest.

Walsh is also the spokesperson for the American digital multicast network Justice Network.

==Family==
After the murder of Adam, the Walshes had three more children: Meghan (b. 1982), Callahan (b. 1985), and Hayden (b. 1994). &quot;These kids saved our lives,&quot; Walsh has said. He said their home was in foreclosure after the murder as he spent time searching for his son and then for the killer. 

Meghan was born a year after Adam was murdered. Revé Walsh told local newspapers at the time that &quot;there is no substitute for Adam.&quot; She also said, &quot;Meghan will make me miss Adam more. He always wanted a sister.&quot; In a July 27, 2006, family interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Meghan said she was living in North Carolina and had recently gotten engaged to a medical student at the University of North Carolina and was still a &quot;daddy&#x27;s girl&quot;. She described herself as an artist who painted commissioned works. She eventually had four children whom she has said were removed from her custody by Florida officials and the oldest were living with her parents. Meghan, who has had basal cell cancer on her nose, appears in videos in which she rails against her father and his work.

Hayden and Callahan sometimes accompanied their father when filming TV shows, including &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. On a 2006 &quot;Larry King Live show,&quot; Larry King said that Hayden, then 11, resembled Adam. Hayden, a polo player, worked in production and Callahan was a co-host of &quot;In Pursuit With John Walsh&quot; beginning in 2019. The show told the stories of victims and their families looking for justice for their murdered loved ones. Callahan, a graduate of Stetson University, joined his father as co-host of the 2024 reboot of America&#x27;s Most Wanted on Fox. &quot;I&#x27;m lucky to have Callahan,&quot; Walsh told &quot;People.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m such an old bastard and I&#x27;m still cooking, but I got the young legs right here helping me out.&quot; Callahan serves as executive director of the Florida branch of the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children.

==Tributes==
On August 15, 2006, Walsh&#x27;s hometown of Auburn, New York, named a street after him.

In October 2008, he was awarded the Operation Kids 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award for his dedication to protecting children and to raise funds for the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, which Walsh co-founded with his wife.

==Controversy==
Walsh generated a great deal of controversy during a summer press tour in 2006 when he stated to the media he had jokingly told senators to implant &quot;exploding&quot; chips in the anuses of sex offenders. He stated, &quot;I said implant it in their anus and if they go outside the radius, explode it, that would send a big message.&quot; Walsh stated this was a &quot;joke&quot;. Walsh later suggested implanting GPS chips in such criminals.

Walsh also faced criticism when he advised women to never hire a male babysitter, which was seen as a blatantly sexist remark. &quot;It&#x27;s not a witch hunt,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s all about minimizing risks. What dog is more likely to bite and hurt you? A Doberman, not a poodle. Who&#x27;s more likely to molest a child? A male.&quot;

In his book &quot;Tears of Rage&quot;, Walsh openly admits being in a relationship with 16-year-old Revé when Walsh was in his early 20s and aware of the age of consent being 17 in New York. 

Some critics accuse Walsh of creating predator panic through his work. Walsh was heard by Congress on February 2, 1983, where he gave an unsourced claim of 50,000 abducted and 1.5 million missing children annually. He testified that the U.S. is &quot;littered with mutilated, decapitated, raped, strangled children,&quot; when in fact, a 1999 Department of Justice study found only 115 incidences of stereotypical kidnappings perpetrated by strangers, about 50 of which resulted in death or the child not being found. Critics have stated that the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, which started without funding in 1981, generated $1.5 million annually following his testimony before the Congress.

<text>Elaeis () is a genus of palms, called oil palms, containing two species, native to Africa and the Americas. They are used in commercial agriculture in the production of palm oil.

==Description==
Mature palms are single-stemmed, and can grow well over tall. The leaves are pinnate, and reach between long. The flowers are produced in dense clusters; each individual flower is small, with three sepals and three petals.

The palm fruit is reddish, about the size of a large plum, and grows in large bunches. Each fruit is made up of an oily, fleshy outer layer (the pericarp), with a single seed (the palm kernel), also rich in oil.

==Species==
The two species, &quot;E. guineensis&quot; (Africa) and &quot;E. oleifera&quot; (Americas) can produce fertile hybrids. The genome of &quot;E. guineensis&quot; has been sequenced, which has important implications for breeding improved strains of the crop plants.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;E. guineensis&quot; is native to west and southwest Africa, occurring between Angola and Gambia. The American oil palm, &quot;E. oleifera&quot; (), is native to tropical Central and South America from Honduras to northern Brazil, and is used locally for oil production.

==Uses==
===Commercial palm oil cultivation===
Since palm oil contains more saturated fats than oils made from canola, corn, linseed, soybeans, safflower, and sunflowers, it can withstand extreme deep-frying heat and resists oxidation. It contains no trans fat, and its use in food has increased as food-labelling laws have changed to specify trans fat content. Oil from &quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot; is also used as biofuel.

Human use of oil palms may date back to about 5,000 years in coastal west Africa. Palm oil was also discovered in the late 19th century by archaeologists in a tomb at Abydos dating back to 3000 BCE. It is thought that Arab traders brought the oil palm to Egypt.

&quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot; is now extensively cultivated in tropical countries outside Africa, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia which together produce most of the world supply, as well as domestically in the Americas.

==== Controversy ====
Palm oil is typically considered the most controversial of the cooking oils – for political, health, and environmental reasons. Palm oil plantations are under increasing scrutiny for social and environmental harm, particularly because rainforests with high biodiversity are destroyed, greenhouse gas output is increased, and because people are displaced by palm-oil enterprises and traditional livelihoods are negatively impacted. Especially in Indonesia, there is also growing pressure for palm oil producers to prove that they are not harming rare animals in the cultivation process.

In 2018 a Christmas TV advertisement by UK supermarket chain Iceland Foods Ltd, produced by Greenpeace, was banned by the UK advertising watchdog Clearcast, as it was deemed too political. This was an animated short, starring a fictional orangutan named Rang-tan produced to raise awareness of the environmental impact of the production of palm oil, and the dangers orangutans face as a result. Iceland Foods had committed to banning palm oil from its own-brand products by the end of 2018.

Almost all wildlife declines in both diversity and abundance in oil palm plantations.

===Fiber===
&quot;Elaeis&quot; was found to be a cheap source of nanofiber by Fahma et al 2010. It is especially suited to production in Indonesia where cellulosic waste is already an abundant byproduct.

<doc id="347098" wikidata="Q5577884" url="?curid=347098" title="Going postal">
<text>Going postal is an American English slang phrase referring to becoming extremely and uncontrollably angry, often to the point of violence, and usually in a workplace environment. The expression derives from a series of incidents from 1986 onward in which United States Postal Service (USPS) workers shot and killed managers, fellow workers, police officers and members of the general public in acts of mass murder. Between 1970 and 1997, more than 40 people were killed by then-current or former employees in at least 20 incidents of workplace rage. Between 1986 and 2011, workplace shootings happened roughly twice per year, with an average of 1.18 people killed per year.

==Origin==
The earliest known &quot;written&quot; use of the phrase was on December 17, 1993, in the American newspaper the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;:

On December 31, 1993, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said, &quot;Unlike the more deadly mass shootings around the nation, which have lent a new term to the language, referring to shooting up the office as &#x27;going postal&#x27;.&quot;

As a result of two shootings on the same day on May 6, 1993, in 1993 the USPS created 85 Workplace Environment Analysts for domicile at its 85 postal districts. These new positions were created to help with violence prevention and workplace improvement. In February 2009, the USPS unilaterally eliminated these positions as part of its downsizing efforts.

==Notable postal shootings==
===Edmond, Oklahoma, 1986===
On August 20, 1986, postman Patrick Sherrill shot and killed 14 employees and wounded six at the Edmond, Oklahoma, post office. Sherrill then killed himself with a shot to the forehead.

===Royal Oak, Michigan, 1991===

On November 14, 1991, in Royal Oak, Michigan, Thomas McIlvane killed five people, including himself, and injured five others with a rifle in Royal Oak&#x27;s post office, after being fired from the Postal Service for &quot;insubordination&quot;. He had been previously suspended for getting into altercations with postal customers on his route.

For some time before the Royal Oak incident, the service had experienced labor/management and operational problems and customer service complaints. This had drawn the attention of local media. The Office of Senator Carl Levin investigated Royal Oak, the results of which were summarized in a September 10, 1991, staff memorandum. The memorandum documented &quot;patterns of harassment, intimidation, cruelty and allegations of favoritism in promotions and demotions ... [and] testimony relating to wide-ranging delivery and service problems&quot; before the McIlvane shooting.

===Goleta, California, 2006===

Jennifer San Marco, a former postal employee, killed six postal employees before killing herself with a handgun, on the evening of January 30, 2006, at a large postal processing facility in Goleta, California. Police later also identified a seventh victim dead in a condominium complex in Goleta where San Marco once lived. According to media reports, the Postal Service had forced San Marco to retire in 2003 because of her worsening mental problems. The incident is believed to be the deadliest workplace shooting ever carried out in the United States by a woman.

==Analysis==
In 1998, the United States Congress conducted a joint hearing to review the violence in the U.S. Postal Service. In the hearing, it was noted that while the postal service accounted for less than 1% of the full-time civilian labor force, 13% of workplace homicides were committed at postal facilities by current or former employees.

In 2000, researchers found that the homicide rates at postal facilities were lower than at other workplaces. In major industries, the highest rate of 2.1 homicides per 100,000 workers per year was in retail. The homicide rate for postal workers was 0.22 per 100,000 versus 0.77 per 100,000 workers in general. The common depiction of an employee returning to work for revenge on their boss is over-stated. More than half of mass workplace shootings are by current employees, and a little under a quarter are by employees who have been at their job for less than a year.

==Cultural impact==
In the controversial video game series &quot;Postal&quot;, the player takes on the role of a mass murderer in the first game, and in the later series a first-person role performing normally mundane chores (such as picking up a paycheck from work) with an often gratuitously violent twist. In 1997, the USPS sued the creators of the game, Running with Scissors, over the use of the term &quot;postal&quot;. Running with Scissors argued that, despite its title, the game has absolutely nothing to do with the USPS or its employees. The case was dismissed with prejudice in 2003.

The 1994 comedy film &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot; includes a scene where the main character must deal with a series of escalating threats, including the sudden appearance of dozens of disgruntled postal workers randomly firing weapons in every direction.

In the 1996 simulation game &quot;Afterlife&quot;, one of Wrath&#x27;s punishments involves putting two groups of sinful souls in a post office, one in line to send a package and another working in the mail room, expecting both to get frustrated and grab rifles to initiate shootouts.

In the 1995 film &quot;Clueless&quot;, Cher Horowitz, played by Alicia Silverstone, frets, &quot;I had an overwhelming sense of ickiness... like Josh thinking I was mean was making me postal.&quot;

In the 1995 fantasy film &quot;Jumanji&quot;, after the hunter Van Pelt purchases a replacement rifle at the local gun shop and then bribes the clerk into filling out the necessary legal documents for him, the clerk asks Van Pelt whether he is a postal worker.

The 2004 &quot;Discworld&quot; novel &quot;Going Postal&quot; by Terry Pratchett centers around Moist von Lipwig, a con artist and criminal, who as punishment is made the Postmaster General of Ankh-Morpork and forced to revive the Post Office. The phrase &quot;going postal&quot; meaning &quot;to go mad&quot; is used in subsequent books in reference to the events of the novel.

In the &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; episode &quot;USPIS&quot;, self-righteous United States Postal Inspection Service agent Jack Danger (pronounced Donger), who is passionate about his job, is adamant that &quot;going postal&quot; is the term most associated with bringing goodness into people&#x27;s lives, which is a view shared by his co-workers, though not the NYPD Detectives.

Most early removable media, such as floppy disks and optical discs, require a dedicated read/write device (i.e. a drive) to be installed in the computer, while others, such as USB flash drives, are plug-and-play with all the hardware required to read them built into the device, so only need a driver software to be installed in order to communicate with the device. Some removable media readers/drives are integrated into the computer case, while others are standalone devices that need to be additionally installed or connected.

Examples of removable media that require a dedicated reader drive include:
* Optical discs, e.g. Blu-rays (both standard and UHD versions), DVDs, CDs
* Flash memory-based memory cards, e.g. CompactFlash, Secure Digital, Memory Stick
* Magnetic storage media
** Floppy and Zip disks (now obsolete)
** Disk packs (now obsolete)
** Magnetic tapes
* Paper data storage, e.g. punched cards, punched tapes (now obsolete)

Examples of removable media that are standalone plug-and-play devices that carry their own reader hardwares include:
* USB flash drives
* Portable storage devices
** Dedicated external solid-state drives (SSD)
** Enclosured mass storage drives, i.e. modified hard disk drives (HDD)/internal SSDs
* Peripheral devices that have integrated data storage capability
** Digital cameras
** Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and handheld game consoles
** Portable media players
* Other external or dockable peripherals that have expandable removable media capabilities, usually via a USB port or memory card reader
** USB hubs
** Wired or wireless printers
** Network routers, access points and switches

Using removable media can pose some computer security risks, including viruses, data theft and the introduction of malware.

== History ==
The earliest form of removable media, punched cards and tapes, predates the electronic computer by centuries, with the Jacquard loom of 1801 using interlinked cards to control the machine. This followed a loom made by Basile Bouchon in 1725 that used paper tape for its instructions. Punched tape was later used in Colossus, the first electronic computer.

Magnetic tape was developed in the early 20th century in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording invented by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. In 1951, the UNIVAC I was released, using magnetic tape to store data. 8-inch floppy disks were commercially introduced in 1971 by IBM, with them being compacted to -inch by Shugart Associates in 1976. At the same time Compact Cassettes started being used to store data, being popular in the late 1970s and 1980s for holding data for personal computers. In 1982, the -inch floppy disk became commonplace, with its introduction for the Apple Macintosh and Amiga.

The CD-ROM was introduced in 1985, providing much higher capacity than a floppy disk, however could not be written to. This was resolved in 1990 with the introduction of the CD-R. The CD-RW, introduced in 1997 allowed the CD to be written to multiple times, rather than just once, as with the CD-R. DVD versions of these formats introduced in the late 1990s provided further increases in capacity. Additional capacity improvements were achieved with Blu-ray in 2006.

The turn of the millennium saw the widespread introduction of solid-state removable media, with the SD card being introduced in 1999, followed by the USB flash drive in 2000. The capacity of these removable flash drives improved over time, with 2013 seeing Kingston unveiling a 1 terabyte USB flash drive.

== Floppy disk storage ==
Storage is intended to be used to access data that is access less often. Memory on the other hand is used to access data that is used on a more frequent basis. One of the problems with the earliest computers was how to store data. In the 1950s the International Business Machines (IBM) was trying to solve this problem.

The first floppy disk was developed under the supervision of Alan Shugart in the late 1960s. The floppy disk was not introduced to the public until the 1970s by IBM. But, like any man-made product the floppy disk came with its pros and cons, such as it being cheap and portable while also having severely limited data storage.

== Risks ==
The use of removable media creates a risk of data loss in the event that the media is lost or stolen. This can lead to the compromise of large amounts of sensitive data, which can result in significant damage to the reputation of a business, as well as possible financial penalties. This risk can be minimised by company policies that reduce the use of removable media when transporting and storing data, and by encrypting the contents of removable media. Prior to the disposal or reuse of removable media, appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that all data previously stored on the device is not accessible. Additionally, any device holding sensitive data should be kept secure when not in use.

Removable media can also be used as a vector for malware. Attackers generally use social engineering to get someone to put a media device into a computer, for example by leaving an infected drive in a busy location, from which someone may pick up the device and put it into their computer to find its contents, such an attack is known as baiting. Once the device has been plugged in it can be used to infect an entire network. One example of malware that propagates through removable media such as USB flash drives is Stuxnet, which caused significant damage to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. The risk from an attack like this can be reduced by automatically scanning media for malware and prohibiting users from attempting to access the contents of removable media of unknown origin.

<doc id="347102" wikidata="Q1999119" url="?curid=347102" title="Oberon (operating system)">
<text>The Oberon System is a modular, single-user, single-process, multitasking operating system written in the programming language Oberon. It was originally developed in the late 1980s at ETH Zurich. The Oberon System has an unconventional visual text user interface (TUI) instead of a conventional command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI). This TUI was very innovative in its time and influenced the design of the Acme text editor for the Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating system.

The system also evolved into the multi-process, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) capable A2 (formerly &quot;Active Object System&quot; (AOS), then &quot;Bluebottle&quot;), with a zooming user interface (ZUI).

== History ==
The Oberon operating system originated as part of the NS32032-based Ceres workstation project. It was written almost entirely (and in the 2013 version entirely is valid) in the Oberon programming language. 
The basic system was designed and implemented by Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht and its design and implementation is fully documented in their book &quot;Project Oberon&quot;. The user Interface and programmers reference is found in Martin Reiser&#x27;s book &quot;The Oberon System&quot;. The Oberon System was later extended and ported to other hardware platforms
by a team at ETH Zurich and there was recognition in popular magazines.
Wirth and Gutknecht (although being active computer science professors) refer to themselves as &#x27;part-time programmers&#x27; in the book &quot;Project Oberon&quot;. In late 2013, a few months before his 80th birthday, Wirth published a second edition of Project Oberon. It details implementing the Oberon System using a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) CPU of his own design realized on a Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board. It was presented at the symposium organized for his 80th birthday at ETH Zurich. In the meantime, several emulators for this version were implemented.

According to Josef Templ, a former member of the developer group at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and later member of the &quot;Institut für Systemsoftware&quot; of Johannes Kepler University Linz, where one forked version (V4) was maintained, the genealogy of the different versions of the Oberon System is this:
== User interface ==
Oberon has a text user interface (TUI), which is very different from a terminal user interface. It combines the point and click convenience of a graphical user interface (GUI) with the linguistic strength of a command-line interface (CLI) and is closely tied to the naming conventions of the Oberon language. Text appearing almost anywhere on a screen can be edited and used as command input. Commands are activated by a middle-mouse click on a text fragment of the form codice_1 (optionally followed by parameters, which are terminated by codice_2). A command is defined by any procedure which is exported and has an empty argument list. Parameters to the command must be defined before executing the middle click, and must be explicitly scanned and retrieved by the procedure. No checks or questions occur during command execution. This is sometimes called a &quot;non-modal&quot; user interface (UI). Nothing like a command prompt is needed.

Although very different from a command line, the TUI is very efficient and powerful. A steep ascent in the early learning curve makes it a bit difficult at first. No questions are asked: this is a deliberate design decision, which needs getting used to. Most editors ask the user when closing a modified text: this is not the case in the Oberon System. The use of the TUI and programming interface is fully documented in Martin Reiser&#x27;s book &quot;The Oberon System&quot;. A short introduction to the user interface can be found on Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s home page. The later Versions of System Oberon, &quot;Oberon V4&quot; (V4, sometimes also named Linz-Oberon) and &quot;Oberon System 3&quot; (or S3, sometimes also named ETH-Oberon or Spirit of Oberon), enhanced the basic interface with different but incompatible implementations for buttons, drop down menus, and other active elements. V4 used for that purpose a dedicated control character embedded in normal text in contrast to System 3, which extended the kernel by introducing persistent objects. Both extensions include a large set of user interface elements.

Mastering the Oberon user interface, both the purely textual and the so-called Gadgets System (under S3), is non-trivial. Thus, after successfully installing Oberon System 3, it is recommended to study André Fischers Oberon System 3 Tutorial. An expanded version of this tutorial was published as a book, which it is out of print now. The whole book is available in electronic form under a one user license in every installed version of System 3 (Windows, Linux, or Native, i.e., also with the Gadgets toolkit of OLR). More information how to get your own copy of the Oberon Companion may be found in the section of the Oberon Wikibook.

Similar user Interfaces have yet to appear in more commonplace operating systems. Rob Pike&#x27;s Acme system for Plan 9 from Bell Labs was strongly inspired by the Oberon TUI. Whether the worksheet interface of the Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop influenced Oberon&#x27;s TUI or vice versa is difficult to decide: the Oberon System was based on Wirth&#x27;s prior computer design, the Lilith, and both the Apple Macintosh (and its precursor Lisa) and the Oberon System (on Ceres and its precursor Lilith) have the same roots: they were all inspired by the Alto developed at Xerox PARC.

== Versions and availability ==
V1 was the first usable version some time before the Oberon Trilogy was published. A major change in the text model together with the editor named Write yielded V2. As foreshadowed in the table in section History above, there was a major fork in the early 1990s: V4 vs. System 3: The group around Jürg Gutknecht introduced persistent objects and object-libraries thereby extending the kernel. The group around Hanspeter Mössenböck realized similar features by introducing active elements mapped to a special character thereby extending fonts without changing the kernel. System 3 was sometimes also named Spirit of Oberon and later renamed ETH Oberon, whereas V4 was sometimes also named Linz Oberon.

 As of 2017, the Oberon OS is available for several hardware computing platforms, generally in no cost versions and from several sources, which is quite confusing. The Oberon OS is typically extremely compact. Even with an Oberon compiler, assorted utilities including a web browser, TCP/IP networking, and a GUI, the full package can be compressed to one 3.5&quot; floppy disk. There are versions which emulated the Oberon OS on another operating system and versions which run on bare hardware. The latter ones are named Native Oberon. There are native versions for the Ceres, Intel IA-32, and ARM platforms. In 2013, Niklaus Wirth adapted the basic system as described in &quot;Project Oberon&quot; to a current FPGA design. According to the preface of the 2013 edition, the whole system compiles in less than 10 seconds on a Spartan-3 board. This version is sometimes also named V5, despite it being much more similar functionally to the original V1 running on the Ceres than any of the later versions.

===Plugin Oberon and &quot;slim binaries&quot;===
A version of the Oberon System 3, which is more integrated in the Microsoft Windows OS than other implementations was named Plugin Oberon. Plugin Oberon had support for OLE, Netscape Plugins, and the binary format named Oberon Module Interchange (OMI) or &quot;slim binaries&quot;, which allowed portable object code between Intel x86, Motorola 68K, and PowerPC architectures. Slim binaries were invented by Michael Franz in the early 1990s. They were motivated and opposed to the &quot;fat binaries&quot; invented by Apple during the transition from 68k to PowerPC architectures. OMI provided portable code based on a compressed version of the abstract syntax tree. The approach of a compressed abstract syntax tree for portable code representation is revived in the Java world for GraalVM and Truffle.

===Oberon V4===
The version named Oberon V4 (see also History) is closer to the original operating system developed by Wirth and Gutknecht. It was originally developed at ETHZ, but when H.P. Mössenböck went to Institut für Systemsoftware at Johannes-Kepler University in Linz (JKU), the development of V4 moved also. Thus, V4 is sometimes also called Linz-Oberon in contrast to ETH-Oberon. The most recent version of V4 and extensions are available at JKU. Oberon V4 appears to be orphaned, there are almost no changes since 2000. Another repository of V4 is Claudio Nieder&#x27;s Oberon V4, which also shows difference between the different V4 implementations. Since 2013 this page moved to/is mirrored at SourceForge. V4 is closer to what would now be called an integrated development environment than an operating system of its own. There were many extensions written for V4, which are still available from the ftp server of SSW at JKU; some documentation can be found on their web-pages, more information is normally included in the packages and it is given in Oberon&#x27;s special rich text format.

===AOS/Bluebottle/A2===

Around 2010, the computer science department at ETH Zurich began exploring active objects and concurrency for operating systems, and has released an early version of a new language Active Oberon and a new operating system for it, first named &quot;Active Object System&quot; (AOS) in 2002, then due to trademark issues, renamed &quot;Bluebottle&quot; in 2005, then renamed &quot;A2&quot; in 2008. It is available from ETH Zurich with most source via the Internet. Native versions of A2 run on single- and multi-processor IA-32 and x86-64 hardware, both on bare metal and inside virtual machines. It was previously also available for the StrongARM CPU family. Versions which execute as programs under other operating systems are available on Windows (WinAos), Unix (UnixAos), Linux (LinuxAos), and macOS (DarwinAos). More detailed information about A2 is on the Russian Wikipedia pages about A2.

===stailaOS===
As a part of an industrial research project the Native Systems Group of ETH Zurich has developed an application-specific operating system named &quot;stailaOS&quot; which is based on the latest version Oberon OS. It is intended for uses such as real-time analytics, financial applications, main memory based enterprise resource planning (ERP), etc.

===Native Oberon===

Native Oberon is an Oberon System that runs on bare hardware. &quot;PC-Native Oberon&quot; is a version that runs on IA-32 PC hardware. There has never been a V4 Native Oberon, so all information in this section implicitly assumes that it is System 3. Native Oberon has small hardware requirements: 133 MHz Pentium, 100MB hard disk, VESA 2 graphics card with resolution minimum of 1024x768 pixels, optional 3Com network card. The basic system runs from one HD floppy disk, and more software can be installed through a network. The full installation includes the Gadgets GUI. It is written fully in the language Oberon. The latest available version was 2.3.7. It is dated 5. January 2003 and sometimes also labeled as Update/Alpha, especially on the ftp-server of ETHZ. Later versions were incorporated in AOS/BlueBottle/A2.

===LNO===
A version named Linux Native Oberon (LNO) uses Linux as a hardware abstraction layer (HAL). Its goal is to be as compatible as possible to PC-Native Oberon. Other versions of the Oberon System, without &quot;Native&quot; in the name, had partly modified interfaces of low level modules. In 2015, Peter Matthias revitalized LNO under the name Oberon Linux Revival (OLR) as a multi-platform distribution running seamlessly on Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, and RISC-V. It runs well on the Raspberry Pi and on the low cost (discontinued) CHIP computer; with some tweaking (adjusting group membership or/and permissions on some devices) it runs well on Tiny Core Linux. OLR interfaces with Linux kernel by direct system calls. , OLR lacks a network layer.

==Project Oberon 2013==
In 2013, Wirth and Paul Reed completed a re-implementation of the original Oberon System for the Digilent Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA Starter Board. The work includes a revision of &quot;Project Oberon&quot;, identified as Project Oberon (New Edition 2013). In 2015, Reed collaborated with Victor Yurkovsky to create OberonStation, a Xilinx Spartan 3-based computer designed specifically to run Oberon. The system has since been ported to a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA Pepino development board by Saanlima Electronics, and a Xilinx Artix 7-based Digilent Nexys A7-100 FPGA Trainer board by CFB Software. Peter de Wachter implemented an emulator for it, which was also ported to Java and JavaScript by Michael Schierl, running in modern browsers, and ported to Free Pascal/Ultibo by Markus Greim and to Go. Andreas Pirklbauer maintains an experimental version and extensions of Project Oberon 2013 at GitHub.

<text>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu (born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, ; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as Mother Teresa or Saint Mother Teresa, was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun, founder of the Missionaries of Charity and is a Catholic saint. Born in Skopje, then part of the Ottoman Empire, she was raised in a devoutly Catholic family. At the age of 18, she moved to Ireland to join the Sisters of Loreto and later to India, where she lived most of her life and carried out her missionary work. On 4 September 2016, she was canonised by the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. The anniversary of her death, 5 September, is now observed as her feast day.

Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation that was initially dedicated to serving &quot;the poorest of the poor&quot; in the slums of Calcutta. Over the decades, the congregation grew to operate in over 133 countries, , with more than 4,500 nuns managing homes for those dying from HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis, as well as running soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, orphanages, and schools. Members of the order take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give &quot;wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.&quot;

Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. Her life and work have inspired books, documentaries, and films. Her authorized biography, written by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992, and on 6 September 2017, she was named a co-patron of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta alongside St Francis Xavier. However, she was also a controversial figure, drawing criticism for her staunch opposition to abortion, divorce and contraception, as well as the poor conditions and lack of medical care or pain relief in her houses for the dying.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Mother Teresa&#x27;s given name was Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha) Bojaxhiu ( is a cognate of &quot;Agnes&quot;; means &quot;flower bud&quot; in Albanian). She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian family in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the capital of North Macedonia). She was baptised in Skopje the day after her birth. She later considered 27 August, the day she was baptised, her &quot;true birthday&quot;.

She was the youngest child of Nikollë and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai). Her father, who was involved in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, was probably poisoned, an act attributed to Serbian agents, after he had visited Belgrade for a political meeting in 1919 when she was eight years old. He was born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), however, his family was from Mirdita (present-day Albania). Her mother may have been from a village near Gjakova, believed by her offspring to be Bishtazhin.

According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, Anjezë was in her early years when she became fascinated by stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life. Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as she prayed at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimages.

Anjezë left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Ireland, to learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; English was the language of instruction of the Sisters of Loreto in India. She saw neither her mother nor her sister again. Her family lived in Skopje until 1934, when they moved to Tirana. During communist leader Enver Hoxha&#x27;s rule, she was considered a dangerous agent of the Vatican. Despite multiple requests and despite the fact that many countries made requests on her behalf, she was denied a chance to see her family and was not granted the opportunity to see her mother and sister. Both of them died during Hoxha&#x27;s rule, and Anjezë herself was only able to visit Albania five years after the communist regime collapsed. Dom Lush Gjergji in his book &quot;Our Mother Teresa&quot; describes one of her trips to the embassy where she was crying as she was leaving the building, saying:Dear God, I can understand and accept that I should suffer, but it is so hard to understand and accept why my mother has to suffer. In her old age she has no other wish than to see us one last time.She arrived in India in 1929 and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas, where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa&#x27;s School near her convent. She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries; because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its Spanish spelling of Teresa.

Teresa took her solemn vows on 14 May 1937 while she was a teacher at the Loreto convent school in Entally, eastern Calcutta, taking the style of &#x27;Mother&#x27; as part of Loreto custom. She served there for nearly twenty years and was appointed its headmistress in 1944. Although Mother Teresa enjoyed teaching at the school, she was increasingly disturbed by the poverty surrounding her in Calcutta. The Bengal famine of 1943 brought misery and death to the city, and the August 1946 Direct Action Day began a period of Muslim-Hindu violence.

In 1946, during a visit to Darjeeling by train, Mother Teresa felt that she heard the call of her inner conscience to serve the poor of India for Jesus. She asked for and received permission to leave the school. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, choosing a white sari with two blue borders as the order&#x27;s habit.

===Missionaries of Charity===
On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as &quot;the call within the call&quot; when she travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. &quot;I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith.&quot; Joseph Langford, MC, founder of her congregation of priests, the Missionaries of Charity Fathers, later wrote, &quot;Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just become &quot;Mother&quot; Teresa&quot;.

She began missionary work with the poor in 1948, replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums. She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and hungry. At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the &quot;poorest among the poor&quot;.

Her efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including the prime minister. Mother Teresa wrote in her diary that her first year was fraught with difficulty. With no income, she begged for food and supplies and experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to the comfort of convent life during these early months:


On 7 October 1950, Mother Teresa received Vatican permission for the diocesan congregation, which would become the Missionaries of Charity. In her words, it would care for &quot;the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone&quot;.

In 1952, Mother Teresa opened her first hospice with help from Calcutta officials. She converted an abandoned Hindu temple into the Kalighat Home for the Dying, free for the poor, and renamed it Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday). Those brought to the home received medical attention and the opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with their faith: Muslims were to read the Quran, Hindus received water from the Ganges, and Catholics received extreme unction. &quot;A beautiful death&quot;, Mother Teresa said, &quot;is for people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted.&quot;
She opened a hospice for those with leprosy, calling it Shanti Nagar (City of Peace). The Missionaries of Charity established leprosy-outreach clinics throughout Calcutta, providing medication, dressings and food. The Missionaries of Charity took in an increasing number of homeless children; in 1955, Mother Teresa opened Nirmala Shishu Bhavan, the Children&#x27;s Home of the Immaculate Heart, as a haven for orphans and homeless youth.

The congregation began to attract recruits and donations, and by the 1960s it had opened hospices, orphanages and leper houses throughout India. Mother Teresa then expanded the congregation abroad, opening a house in Venezuela in 1965 with five sisters. Houses followed in Italy (Rome), Tanzania and Austria in 1968, and, during the 1970s, the congregation opened houses and foundations in the United States and dozens of countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.

The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a contemplative branch of the Sisters followed in 1976. Lay Catholics and non-Catholics were enrolled in the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa, the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, and the Lay Missionaries of Charity. Responding to requests by many priests, in 1981, Mother Teresa founded the Corpus Christi Movement for Priests and with Joseph Langford founded the Missionaries of Charity Fathers in 1984 to combine the vocational aims of the Missionaries of Charity with the resources of the priesthood.

By 1997, the 13-member Calcutta congregation had grown to more than 4,000 sisters who managed orphanages, AIDS hospices and charity centres worldwide, caring for refugees, the blind, the disabled, the aged, alcoholics, the poor and homeless and victims of floods, epidemics and famine. By 2007, the Missionaries of Charity numbered about 450 brothers and 5,000 sisters worldwide, operating 600 missions, schools and shelters in 120 countries.

===International charity===
Mother Teresa said, &quot;By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong entirely to the Heart of Jesus.&quot;

Fluent in five languages – Bengali, Albanian, Serbo-Croatian, English and Hindi – she made occasional trips outside India for humanitarian reasons. These included, in 1971, a visit with four of her sisters, to Troubles-era Belfast. Her suggestion that the conditions she had found justified an ongoing mission was the cause of some embarrassment. Reportedly under pressure from senior clergy, who believed &quot;the missionary traffic should be in other direction&quot;, and despite local welcome and support, she and her sisters abruptly left the city in 1973.

At the height of the Siege of Beirut in 1982, Mother Teresa rescued 37 children trapped in a front-line hospital by brokering a temporary cease-fire between the Israeli army and Palestinian guerrillas. Accompanied by Red Cross workers, she travelled through the war zone to the hospital to evacuate the young patients.

When Eastern Europe experienced increased openness in the late 1980s, Mother Teresa expanded her efforts to Communist countries which had rejected the Missionaries of Charity. She began dozens of projects, undeterred by criticism of her stands against abortion and divorce: &quot;No matter who says what, you should accept it with a smile and do your own work&quot;. She visited Armenia after the 1988 earthquake and met with Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov.

Mother Teresa travelled to assist the hungry in Ethiopia, radiation victims at Chernobyl and earthquake victims in Armenia. In 1991 she returned to Albania for the first time, opening a Missionaries of Charity Brothers home in Tirana.

By 1996, the Missionaries of Charity operated 517 missions in over 100 countries. The number of sisters in the Missionaries of Charity grew from twelve to thousands, serving the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot; in 450 centres worldwide. The first Missionaries of Charity home in the United States was established in the South Bronx area of New York City, and by 1984 the congregation operated 19 establishments throughout the country.

===Declining health and death===
Mother Teresa had a heart attack in Rome in 1983 while she was visiting Pope John Paul II. Following a second attack in 1989, she received a pacemaker. In 1991, after a bout of pneumonia in Mexico, she had additional heart problems. Although Mother Teresa offered to resign as head of the Missionaries of Charity, in a secret ballot the sisters of the congregation voted for her to stay, and she agreed to continue.

In April 1996, Mother Teresa fell, breaking her collarbone, and four months later she had malaria and heart failure. Although she underwent heart surgery, her health was clearly declining. According to the Archbishop of Calcutta Henry Sebastian D&#x27;Souza, he ordered a priest to perform an exorcism (with her permission) when she was first hospitalised with cardiac problems because he thought she might be under attack by the devil. On 13 March 1997, Mother Teresa resigned as head of the Missionaries of Charity. She died on 5 September.

==== Reactions ====
Mother Teresa lay in repose in an open casket in St Thomas, Calcutta, for a week before her funeral. She received a state funeral from the Indian government in gratitude for her service to the poor of all religions in the country. Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano, the Pope&#x27;s representative, delivered the homily at the service. Mother Teresa&#x27;s death was mourned in the secular and religious communities. Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif called her &quot;a rare and unique individual who lived long for higher purposes. Her life-long devotion to the care of the poor, the sick, and the disadvantaged was one of the highest examples of service to our humanity.&quot; According to former U.N. Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, &quot;She is the United Nations. She is peace in the world.&quot;

==Recognition and reception==
===India===
From the Indian government, under the name of Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, Mother Teresa was issued a diplomatic passport. She received the Padma Shri in 1962 and the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1969. She later received other Indian awards, including the Bharat Ratna (India&#x27;s highest civilian award) in 1980. Mother Teresa&#x27;s official biography, by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992. In Calcutta, she is worshipped as a deity by some Hindus.

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of her birth, the government of India issued a special 5 coin (the amount of money Mother Teresa had when she arrived in India) on 28 August 2010. President Pratibha Patil said, &quot;Clad in a white sari with a blue border, she and the sisters of Missionaries of Charity became a symbol of hope to many—namely, the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families.&quot;

Indian views of Mother Teresa are not uniformly favourable. Aroup Chatterjee, a physician born and raised in Calcutta who was an activist in the city&#x27;s slums for years around 1980 before moving to the UK, said that he &quot;never even saw any nuns in those slums&quot;. His research, involving more than 100 interviews with volunteers, nuns and others familiar with the Missionaries of Charity, was described in a 2003 book critical of Mother Teresa. Chatterjee criticized her for promoting a &quot;cult of suffering&quot; and a distorted, negative image of Calcutta, exaggerating work done by her mission and misusing funds and privileges at her disposal. According to him, some of the hygiene problems he had criticized (such as the reuse of needles) improved after Mother Teresa&#x27;s death in 1997.

Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, mayor of Calcutta from 2005 to 2010, said that &quot;she had no significant impact on the poor of this city&quot;, glorified illness instead of treating it and misrepresented the city: &quot;No doubt there was poverty in Calcutta, but it was never a city of lepers and beggars, as Mother Teresa presented it.&quot; On the Hindu right, the Bharatiya Janata Party clashed with Mother Teresa over the Christian Dalits but praised her in death and sent a representative to her funeral. Vishwa Hindu Parishad, however, opposed the government decision to grant her a state funeral. Secretary Giriraj Kishore said that &quot;her first duty was to the Church and social service was incidental&quot;, accusing her of favouring Christians and conducting &quot;secret baptisms&quot; of the dying. In a front-page tribute, the Indian fortnightly &quot;Frontline&quot; dismissed the charges as &quot;patently false&quot; and said that they had &quot;made no impact on the public perception of her work, especially in Calcutta&quot;. Praising her &quot;selfless caring&quot;, energy and bravery, the author of the tribute criticised Teresa&#x27;s public campaign against abortion and her claim to be non-political.

In February 2015 Mohan Bhagwat, leader of the Hindu right-wing organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, said that Mother Teresa&#x27;s objective was &quot;to convert the person, who was being served, into a Christian&quot;. Former RSS spokesperson M. G. Vaidhya supported Bhagwat&#x27;s assessment, and the organisation accused the media of &quot;distorting facts about Bhagwat&#x27;s remarks&quot;. Trinamool Congress MP Derek O&#x27;Brien, CPI leader Atul Anjan and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal protested Bhagwat&#x27;s statement. In 1991 the country&#x27;s first modern University, Senate of Serampore College (University) awarded a honorary doctorate during registrarship of D. S. Satyaranjan.

===Elsewhere===
Mother Teresa received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Peace and International Understanding, given for work in South or East Asia, in 1962. According to its citation, &quot;The Board of Trustees recognises her merciful cognisance of the abject poor of a foreign land, in whose service she has led a new congregation&quot;. By the early 1970s, Mother Teresa was an international celebrity. She had been catapulted to fame via Malcolm Muggeridge&#x27;s 1969 BBC documentary, &quot;Something Beautiful for God&quot;, before he released a 1971 book of the same name. Muggeridge was undergoing a spiritual journey of his own at the time. During filming, footage shot in poor lighting (particularly at the Home for the Dying) was thought unlikely to be usable by the crew; the crew had been using new, untested photographic film. In England, the footage was found to be extremely well-lit and Muggeridge called it a miracle of &quot;divine light&quot; from Teresa. Other crew members said that it was due to a new type of ultra-sensitive Kodak film. Muggeridge later converted to Catholicism.

Around this time, the Catholic world began to honour Mother Teresa publicly. Pope Paul VI gave her the inaugural Pope John XXIII Peace Prize in 1971, commending her work with the poor, her display of Christian charity and her efforts for peace. She received the Pacem in Terris Award in 1976. After her death, Teresa progressed rapidly on the road to sainthood.
She was honoured by governments and civilian organisations and appointed an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia in 1982 &quot;for service to the community of Australia and humanity at large&quot;. The United Kingdom and the United States bestowed a number of awards, culminating in the Order of Merit in 1983 and honorary citizenship of the United States on 16 November 1996. Mother Teresa&#x27;s Albanian homeland gave her the Golden Honour of the Nation in 1994, but her acceptance of this and the Haitian Legion of Honour was controversial. Mother Teresa was criticised for implicitly supporting the Duvaliers and corrupt businessmen such as Charles Keating and Robert Maxwell; she wrote to the judge of Keating&#x27;s trial requesting clemency.

Universities in India and the West granted her honorary degrees. Other civilian awards included the Balzan Prize for promoting humanity, peace and brotherhood among peoples (1978) and the Albert Schweitzer International Prize (1975). In April 1976, Mother Teresa visited the University of Scranton in northeastern Pennsylvania, where she received the La Storta Medal for Human Service from university president William J. Byron. She challenged an audience of 4,500 to &quot;know poor people in your own home and local neighbourhood&quot;, feeding others or simply spreading joy and love. Mother Teresa continued: &quot;The poor will help us grow in sanctity, for they are Christ in the guise of distress&quot;. In August 1987, Mother Teresa received an honorary doctor of social science degree from the university in recognition of her service and her ministry to help the destitute and sick. She spoke to over 4,000 students and members of the Diocese of Scranton about her service to the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot;, telling them to &quot;do small things with great love&quot;.

During her lifetime, Mother Teresa was among the top 10 women in the annual Gallup&#x27;s most admired man and woman poll 18 times, finishing first several times in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999 she headed Gallup&#x27;s List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century, out-polling all other volunteered answers by a wide margin. She was first in all major demographic categories except the very young.

==== Nobel Peace Prize ====

In 1979, Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace&quot;. She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world&#x27;s needy. When Mother Teresa received the prize she was asked, &quot;What can we do to promote world peace?&quot; She answered, &quot;Go home and love your family.&quot; Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: &quot;Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society – that poverty is so hurtable and so much, and I find that very difficult.&quot;

== Controversial views/practices ==
===Opposition to abortion===
Mother Teresa singled out abortion as &quot;the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because if a mother can kill her own child – what is left for me to kill you and you kill me – there is nothing between.&quot;

Barbara Smoker of the secular humanist magazine &quot;The Freethinker&quot; criticised Mother Teresa after the Peace Prize award, saying that her promotion of Catholic moral teachings on abortion and contraception diverted funds from effective methods to solve India&#x27;s problems. 

At the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Mother Teresa said: &quot;Yet we can destroy this gift of motherhood, especially by the evil of abortion, but also by thinking that other things like jobs or positions are more important than loving.&quot; Abortion-rights groups have also criticised Mother Teresa&#x27;s stance against abortion and contraception.

===Unethical conversions ===
Navin B. Chawla points out that Mother Teresa never intended to build hospitals, but to provide a place where those who had been refused admittance &quot;could at least die being comforted and with some dignity.&quot; He also counters critics of Mother Teresa by stating that her periodic hospitalizations were instigated by staff members against her wishes and he disputes the claim that she conducted unethical conversions. &quot;Those who are quick to criticise Mother Teresa and her mission, are unable or unwilling to do anything to help with their own hands.&quot; 

Similarly, Sister Mary Prema Pierick, the former Superior General of the Missionaries of Charity, also stated that Mother Teresa&#x27;s homes were never intended to be a substitute for hospitals, but rather &quot;homes for those not accepted in the hospital... But if they need hospital care, then we have to take them to the hospital, and we do that.&quot; Sister Pierick also contested the claims that Mother Teresa deliberately cultivated suffering, and affirmed her order&#x27;s goal was to alleviate suffering.

Fr Des Wilson, who had hosted her in Belfast in 1971, argued that &quot;Mother Theresa was content to pick up the sad pieces left by a vicious political and economic system&quot; and he noted that hers was a fate very different to that of Archbishop Óscar Romero of El Salvador. While she got the Nobel Prize, &quot;Romero, who attacked the causes of misery as well as picking up the pieces, was shot in the head&quot;.

===Defence of contentious priests===
In 1994, Mother Teresa argued that the sexual abuse allegations against Jesuit priest Donald McGuire were untrue. When he was convicted of sexually molesting multiple children in 2006, Mother Teresa&#x27;s defence of him was criticised.

===Inadequate care and alleged cruelty===
According to a paper by Canadian academics Serge Larivée, Geneviève Chénard and Carole Sénéchal, Mother Teresa&#x27;s clinics received millions of dollars in donations but lacked medical care, systematic diagnosis, necessary nutrition, and sufficient analgesics for those in pain. 

In the opinion of the three academics, &quot;Mother Teresa believed the sick must suffer like Christ on the cross&quot;. It was said that the additional money might have transformed the health of the city&#x27;s poor by creating advanced palliative care facilities.

One of Mother Teresa&#x27;s most outspoken critics was English journalist Christopher Hitchens, who wrote in a 2003 article: &quot;This returns us to the medieval corruption of the church, which sold indulgences to the rich while preaching hellfire and continence to the poor. [Mother Teresa] was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of . She said that suffering was a gift from God. She spent her life opposing the only known cure for poverty, which is the empowerment of women and the emancipation of them from a livestock version of compulsory reproduction.&quot; Hitchens accused her of hypocrisy for choosing advanced treatment for her heart condition. Hitchens said that &quot;her intention was not to help people&quot; and that she lied to donors about how their contributions were used. &quot;It was by talking to her that I discovered, and she assured me, that she wasn&#x27;t working to alleviate poverty. She was working to expand the number of Catholics. She pursued, &#x27;I&#x27;m not a social worker. I don&#x27;t do it for this reason. I do it for Christ. I do it for the church.

Criticism towards Mother Teresa has been challenged and rebutted by others.

== Spiritual life ==
Analysing her deeds and achievements, Pope John Paul II said: &quot;Where did Mother Teresa find the strength and perseverance to place herself completely at the service of others? She found it in prayer and in the silent contemplation of Jesus Christ, his Holy Face, his Sacred Heart.&quot; Privately, Mother Teresa experienced doubts and struggle in her religious beliefs which lasted nearly 50 years, until the end of her life. Mother Teresa expressed grave doubts about God&#x27;s existence and pain over her lack of faith:

Other saints (including Teresa&#x27;s namesake Thérèse of Lisieux, who called it a &quot;night of nothingness&quot;) had similar experiences of spiritual dryness. According to James Langford, these doubts were typical and would not be an impediment to canonisation.

After ten years of doubt, Mother Teresa described a brief period of renewed faith. After Pope Pius XII&#x27;s death in 1958, she was praying for him at a requiem Mass when she was relieved of &quot;the long darkness: that strange suffering.&quot; Five weeks later her spiritual dryness returned.

Mother Teresa wrote many letters to her confessors and superiors over a 66-year period, most notably to Calcutta Archbishop Ferdinand Perier and Jesuit priest Celeste van Exem (her spiritual advisor since the formation of the Missionaries of Charity). She requested that her letters be destroyed, concerned that &quot;people will think more of me – less of Jesus.&quot;

The correspondence was nevertheless compiled in &quot;Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light&quot;. Mother Teresa wrote to spiritual confidant Michael van der Peet, &quot;Jesus has a very special love for you. [But] as for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great, that I look and do not see – listen and do not hear – the tongue moves [in prayer] but does not speak.[...] I want you to pray for me – that I let Him have [a] free hand.&quot;

In (his first encyclical), Pope Benedict XVI mentioned Mother Teresa three times and used her life to clarify one of the encyclical&#x27;s main points: &quot;In the example of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta we have a clear illustration of the fact that time devoted to God in prayer not only does not detract from effective and loving service to our neighbour but is in fact the inexhaustible source of that service.&quot; She wrote, &quot;It is only by mental prayer and spiritual reading that we can cultivate the gift of prayer.&quot;

Although her order was not connected with the Franciscan orders, Mother Teresa admired Francis of Assisi and was influenced by Franciscan spirituality. The Sisters of Charity recite the prayer of Saint Francis every morning at Mass during the thanksgiving after Communion, and their emphasis on ministry and many of their vows are similar. Francis emphasised poverty, chastity, obedience and submission to Christ. He devoted much of his life to serving the poor, particularly lepers.

==Canonization==
===Miracle and beatification===
After Mother Teresa&#x27;s death in 1997, the Holy See began the process of beatification (the second of three steps towards canonization) and Brian Kolodiejchuk was appointed postulator by the Diocese of Calcutta. Although he said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t have to prove that she was perfect or never made a mistake&quot;, he had to prove that Mother Teresa&#x27;s virtue was heroic. Kolodiejchuk submitted 76 documents, totalling 35,000 pages, which were based on interviews with 113 witnesses who were asked to answer 263 questions.
The process of canonisation requires the documentation of a miracle resulting from the intercession of the prospective saint. In 2002 the Vatican recognised as a miracle the healing of a tumour in the abdomen of Monica Besra, an Indian woman, after the application of a locket containing Teresa&#x27;s picture. According to Besra, a beam of light emanated from the picture and her cancerous tumour was cured; her husband and some of her medical staff, however, said that conventional medical treatment eradicated the tumour. Ranjan Mustafi, who told &quot;The New York Times&quot; he had treated Besra, said that the cyst was caused by tuberculosis: &quot;It was not a miracle ... She took medicines for nine months to one year.&quot; Even though Monica believed in the miracle, Besra&#x27;s husband, &quot;My wife was cured by the doctors and not by any miracle [...] This miracle is a hoax.&quot; Besra said that her medical records, including sonograms, prescriptions and physicians&#x27; notes, were confiscated by Sister Betta of the Missionaries of Charity. According to &quot;Time&quot;, calls to Sister Betta and the office of Sister Nirmala (Teresa&#x27;s successor as head of the order) produced no comment. Officials at Balurghat Hospital, where Besra sought medical treatment, said that they were pressured by the order to call her cure miraculous.

During Mother Teresa&#x27;s beatification and canonisation, the Vatican studied published and unpublished criticism of her life and work. Christopher Hitchens and Chatterjee (author of &quot;The Final Verdict&quot;, a book critical of Mother Teresa) spoke to the tribunal; according to Vatican officials, the allegations raised were investigated by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The group found no obstacle to Mother Teresa&#x27;s canonisation, and issued its on 21 April 1999. Because of the attacks on her, some Catholic writers called her a sign of contradiction. Mother Teresa was beatified on 19 October 2003 and was known by Catholics as &quot;Blessed&quot;.

===Canonization===
On 17 December 2015, the Vatican Press Office confirmed that Pope Francis recognised a second miracle attributed to Mother Teresa: the healing of a Brazilian man with multiple brain tumours back in 2008. The miracle first came to the attention of the postulation (officials managing the cause) during the events of World Youth Day 2013 when the pope was in Brazil that July. A subsequent investigation took place in Brazil from 19–26 June 2015 which was later transferred to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints who issued a decree recognizing the investigation to be completed.

Pope Francis canonised her at a ceremony on 4 September 2016 in St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Vatican City. Tens of thousands of people witnessed the ceremony, including 15 government delegations and 1,500 homeless people from across Italy. It was televised live on the Vatican channel and streamed online; Skopje, Mother Teresa&#x27;s hometown, announced a week-long celebration of her canonisation. In India, a special Mass was celebrated by the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta.

==Co-Patron of Calcutta Archdiocese==
On 4 September 2017, during a celebration honouring the 1st anniversary of her canonisation, Sister Mary Prema Pierick, Superior-General of the Missionaries of Charity, announced that Mother Teresa would be made the co-patron of the Calcutta Archdiocese during a Mass in the Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary on 6 September 2017. On 5 September 2017, Archbishop Thomas D&#x27;Souza, who serves as head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta, confirmed that Mother Teresa would be named co-patron of the Calcutta Diocese, alongside Francis Xavier. On 6 September 2017, about 500 people attended the Mass at a cathedral where Dominique Gomes, the local Vicar General, read the decree instituting her as the second patron saint of the archdiocese. The ceremony was also presided over by D&#x27;Souza and the Vatican&#x27;s ambassador to India, Giambattista Diquattro, who lead the Mass and inaugurated a bronze statue in the church of Mother Teresa carrying a child.

The Catholic Church declared St. Francis Xavier the first patron saint of Calcutta in 1986.

==Legacy and depictions in popular culture==
At the time of her death, the Missionaries of Charity had over 4,000 sisters and an associated brotherhood of 300 members operating 610 missions in 123 countries. These included hospices and homes for people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis, soup kitchens, children&#x27;s and family counselling programmes, orphanages and schools. The Missionaries of Charity were aided by co-workers numbering over one million by the 1990s.

===Commemorations===
Mother Teresa has been commemorated by museums and named the patroness of a number of churches. She has had buildings, roads and complexes named after her, including Albania&#x27;s international airport. Mother Teresa Day (), 5 September, is a public holiday in Albania. In 2009, the Memorial House of Mother Teresa was opened in her hometown of Skopje, North Macedonia. The Cathedral of Blessed Mother Teresa in Pristina, Kosovo, is named in her honour. The demolition of a historic high school building to make way for the new construction initially sparked controversy in the local community, but the high school was later relocated to a new, more spacious campus. Consecrated on 5 September 2017, it became the first cathedral in Mother Teresa&#x27;s honour and the second extant one in Kosovo.
Mother Teresa Women&#x27;s University, in Kodaikanal, was established in 1984 as a public university by the government of Tamil Nadu. The Mother Teresa Postgraduate and Research Institute of Health Sciences, in Pondicherry, was established in 1999 by the government of Puducherry. The charitable organisation Sevalaya runs the Mother Teresa Girls Home, providing poor and orphaned girls near the underserved village of Kasuva in Tamil Nadu with free food, clothing, shelter and education. A number of tributes by Mother Teresa&#x27;s biographer, Navin Chawla, have appeared in Indian newspapers and magazines. Indian Railways introduced the &quot;Mother Express&quot;, a new train named after Mother Teresa, on 26 August 2010 to commemorate the centenary of her birth. The Tamil Nadu government organised centenary celebrations honouring Mother Teresa on 4 December 2010 in Chennai, headed by chief minister M Karunanidhi. Beginning on 5 September 2013, the anniversary of her death has been designated the International Day of Charity by the United Nations General Assembly.

In 2012, Mother Teresa was ranked number 5 in &quot;Outlook&quot; India&#x27;s poll of the Greatest Indian.

Ave Maria University in Ave Maria, Florida is home to the Mother Teresa Museum.

<text>Lorenzo Valla (; also latinized as Laurentius; 1 August 1457) was an Italian Renaissance humanist, rhetorician, educator and scholar. He is best known for his historical-critical textual analysis that proved that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery, therefore attacking and undermining the presumption of temporal power claimed by the papacy. Lorenzo is sometimes seen as a precursor of the Reformation.

== Life ==
Valla was born in Rome, with a family background of Piacenza; his father, Luciave della Valla, was a lawyer who worked in the Papal Curia. He was educated in Rome, attending the classes of teachers including Leonardo Bruni and Giovanni Aurispa, from whom he learned Latin and Greek. He is thought otherwise to have been largely self-taught.

Bruni was a papal secretary; Melchior Scrivani, Valla&#x27;s uncle, was another. But Valla had caused offence, to Antonio Loschi, by championing the rhetorician Quintilian in an early work. In 1431, he was ordained as a priest; the same year Valla tried in vain to secure a position as apostolic secretary to China. He was unsuccessful, despite his network of contacts.

Valla went to Piacenza, and then to Pavia, where he obtained a professorship of eloquence. His tenure at Pavia was made uncomfortable by his attack on the Latin style of the jurist Bartolus de Saxoferrato. He became itinerant, moving from one university to another, accepting short engagements and lecturing in many cities.

Invited to Rome by Pope Nicholas V in 1447, Valla worked there on his &quot;Repastinatio&quot;. He became a papal scribe and, in 1455, a papal secretary.

Valla died in Rome. He was originally buried beneath the monumental bronze &quot;Lex de imperio Vespasiani&quot; behind the altar of Saint John Lateran. His tomb and epitaph were last seen by Seyfried Rybisch in 1570. In 1576, Pope Gregory XIII, a staunch believer in the &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot;, had them destroyed when he removed the bronze to the Palazzo dei Conservatori. Today, there is a memorial to Valla in the Lateran.

==Reputation==
Older biographies of Valla give details of many literary and theological disputes, the most prominent one with Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini, which took place after his settlement in Rome. Extreme language was employed. He appears as quarrelsome, combining humanistic elegance with critical wit and venom, and an opponent of the temporal power of the Catholic Church.

Luther had a high opinion of Valla and of his writings, and Robert Bellarmine called him &quot;Luther&#x27;s precursor&quot;. Erasmus stated in his &quot;De ratione studii&quot; that for Latin grammar, there was &quot;no better guide than Lorenzo Valla&quot;.

==Works==
=== On the Donation of Constantine ===
Between 1439 and 1440, Valla wrote the essay, &quot;De falso credita et ementita Constantini Donatione declamatio&quot;, which analyzed the document usually known as the &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot;. The &quot;Donation&quot; suggests that Constantine I gave the whole of the Western Roman Empire to the Roman Catholic Church. This was supposedly an act of gratitude for having been miraculously cured of leprosy by Pope Sylvester I.

From 1435 to 1445, Valla was employed in the court of Alfonso V of Aragon, who became involved in a territorial conflict with the Papal States, then under Pope Eugene IV. This relationship possibly motivated his work; in any case, he was put on trial before the Catholic Inquisition in 1444, but was protected from imprisonment by the intervention of Alfonso V.

Valla demonstrated that the internal evidence in the &quot;Donation&quot; told against a 4th-century origin: its vernacular style could be dated to the 8th century. Valla argued this thesis in three ways:

# By stating that the Emperor Constantine could not have legally given Pope Sylvester the powers that the &quot;Donation&quot; claimed.
# From the absence of contemporary evidence, Valla reasoned that it was implausible that a major change in the administration of the Western Roman Empire had taken place.
# Valla doubted that Emperor Constantine had given Pope Sylvester anything at all, suggesting a mistake involving an earlier Pope.

Supplementing these points, Valla argued from anachronism: the document contained the word &quot;satrap&quot;, which he believed Romans such as Constantine I would not have used. In addition, Valla believed that the quality of Latin for such a supposedly important text was undeniably poor, evidencing this by the fact that the text constantly switched tenses from &quot;we have proclaimed&quot; to &quot;we decree&quot;, for instance.

===Textual criticism===

A specialist in Latin translation, Valla made numerous suggestions for improving on Petrarch&#x27;s study of Livy. The emendation of Livy was also a topic discussed in book IV of his &quot;Antidotum in Facium&quot;, an invective against Bartolomeo Facio. In this part of the treatise, which also circulated independently under the title &quot;Emendationes in T. Livium&quot;, Valla elucidates numerous corrupt passages and criticises the attempts at emendation made by Panormita and Facio, his rivals at the court of Alfonso V.

In his critical study of the official Bible used by the Roman Catholic Church, Jerome&#x27;s Latin Vulgate, Valla called into question the church&#x27;s system of penance and indulgences. He argued that the practice of penance rested on Jerome&#x27;s use of the Latin word &quot;&quot; (penance) for the Greek &quot;metanoia&quot;, which he believed would have been more accurately translated as &quot;repentance&quot;. Valla&#x27;s work was praised by later critics of the Church&#x27;s penance and indulgence system, including Erasmus.

===Manuscript works===
Valla made a contemporary reputation with two works: his dialogue &quot;De Voluptate&quot; and his treatise &quot;De Elegantiis Latinae Linguae&quot;. Richard Claverhouse Jebb said that his &quot;De Elegantiis&quot; &quot;marked the highest level that had yet been reached in the critical study of Latin&quot;. 
===Printed editions===
Collected editions of Valla&#x27;s works, not quite complete, were published at Basel in 1540 and at Venice in 1592, and &quot;Elegantiae linguae Latinae&quot; was reprinted nearly sixty times between 1471 and 1536.

<text>In finance, valuation is the process of determining the value of a (potential) investment, asset, or security. 
Generally, there are three approaches taken, namely discounted cashflow valuation, relative valuation, and contingent claim valuation.

Valuations can be done for assets (for example, investments in marketable securities such as companies&#x27; shares and related rights, business enterprises, or intangible assets such as patents, data and trademarks) 
or for liabilities (e.g., bonds issued by a company). 
Valuation is a subjective exercise, and in fact, the process of valuation itself can also affect the value of the asset in question.

Valuations may be needed for various reasons such as investment analysis, capital budgeting, merger and acquisition transactions, financial reporting, taxable events to determine the proper tax liability.
In a business valuation context, various techniques are used to determine the (hypothetical) price that a third party would pay for a given company;
while in a portfolio management context, stock valuation is used by analysts to determine the &quot;price&quot; at which the stock is fairly valued relative to its projected and historical earnings, and to thus profit from related price movement.

==Valuation overview==

Common terms for the value of an asset or liability are market value, fair value, and intrinsic value. The meanings of these terms differ. For instance, when an analyst believes a stock&#x27;s intrinsic value is greater (or less) than its market price, an analyst makes a &quot;buy&quot; (or &quot;sell&quot;) recommendation. Moreover, an asset&#x27;s intrinsic value may be subject to personal opinion and vary among analysts. The International Valuation Standards include definitions for common bases of value and generally accepted practice procedures for valuing assets of all types. Regardless, the valuation itself is done generally using one or more of the following approaches:
#Absolute value models (&quot;Intrinsic valuation&quot;) that determine the present value of an asset&#x27;s expected future cash flows. These models take two general forms: multi-period models such as discounted cash flow models, or single-period models such as the Gordon model (which, in fact, often &quot;telescope&quot; the former). These models rely on mathematics rather than price observation. See .
#Relative value models determine value based on the observation of market prices of &#x27;comparable&#x27; assets, relative to a common variable like earnings, cashflows, book value or sales. This result will often be used to complement / revisit the intrinsic valuation. See . 
#Option pricing models, in this context, are used to value specific balance-sheet items, or the asset itself, when these have option-like characteristics. Examples of the first type are warrants, employee stock options, and investments with embedded options such as callable bonds; the second type are usually real options. The most common option pricing models employed here are the Black–Scholes-Merton models, lattice models and Monte Carlo simulations. This approach is sometimes referred to as contingent claim valuation, in that the value will be contingent on some other asset. See .

==Usage==
In finance, valuation analysis is required for many reasons including tax assessment, wills and estates, divorce settlements, business analysis, and basic bookkeeping and accounting. Since the value of things fluctuates over time, valuations are as of a specific date like the end of the accounting quarter or year. They may alternatively be mark-to-market estimates of the current value of assets or liabilities as of this minute or this day for the purposes of managing portfolios and associated financial risk (for example, within large financial firms including investment banks and stockbrokers).

Some balance sheet items are much easier to value than others. Publicly traded stocks and bonds have prices that are quoted frequently and readily available. Other assets are harder to value. For instance, private firms that have no frequently quoted price. Additionally, financial instruments that have prices that are partly dependent on theoretical models of one kind or another are difficult to value and this generates valuation risk. For example, options are generally valued using the Black–Scholes model while the liabilities of life assurance firms are valued using the theory of present value. Intangible business assets, like goodwill and intellectual property, are open to a wide range of value interpretations. Another intangible asset, data, is increasingly being recognized as a valuable asset in the information economy.

It is possible and conventional for financial professionals to make their own estimates of the valuations of assets or liabilities that they are interested in. Their calculations are of various kinds including analyses of companies that focus on price-to-book, price-to-earnings, price-to-cash-flow and present value calculations, and analyses of bonds that focus on credit ratings, assessments of default risk, risk premia, and levels of real interest rates. All of these approaches may be thought of as creating estimates of value that compete for credibility with the prevailing share or bond prices, where applicable, and may or may not result in buying or selling by market participants. Where the valuation is for the purpose of a merger or acquisition the respective businesses make available further detailed financial information, usually on the completion of a non-disclosure agreement.

Valuation requires judgment and assumptions:
* There are different circumstances and purposes to value an asset (e.g., distressed firm, tax purposes, mergers and acquisitions, financial reporting). Such differences can lead to different valuation methods or different interpretations of the method results
* All valuation models and methods have limitations (e.g., degree of complexity, relevance of observations, mathematical form)
* Model inputs can vary significantly because of necessary judgment and differing assumptions

Users of valuations benefit when key information, assumptions, and limitations are disclosed to them. Then they can weigh the degree of reliability of the result and make their decision.

==Business valuation==

Businesses or fractional interests in businesses may be valued for various purposes such as mergers and acquisitions, sale of securities, and taxable events. When correct, a valuation should reflect the capacity of the business to match a certain market demand, as it is the only true predictor of future cash flows. An accurate valuation of privately owned companies largely depends on the reliability of the firm&#x27;s historic financial information. Public company financial statements are audited by Certified Public Accountants (USA), Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) or Chartered Accountants (UK), and Chartered Professional Accountants (Canada) and overseen by a government regulator. Alternatively, private firms do not have government oversight—unless operating in a regulated industry—and are usually not required to have their financial statements audited. Moreover, managers of private firms often prepare their financial statements to minimize profits and, therefore, taxes. Alternatively, managers of public firms tend to want higher profits to increase their stock price. Therefore, a firm&#x27;s historic financial information may not be accurate and can lead to over- and undervaluation. In an acquisition, a buyer often performs due diligence to verify the seller&#x27;s information.

Financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) show many assets based on their historic costs rather than at their current market values. For instance, a firm&#x27;s balance sheet will usually show the value of land it owns at what the firm paid for it rather than at its current market value. But under GAAP requirements, a firm must show the fair values (which usually approximates market value) of some types of assets such as financial instruments that are held for sale rather than at their original cost. When a firm is required to show some of its assets at fair value, some call this process &quot;mark-to-market&quot;. But reporting asset values on financial statements at fair values gives managers ample opportunity to slant asset values upward to artificially increase profits and their stock prices. Managers may be motivated to alter earnings upward so they can earn bonuses. Despite the risk of manager bias, equity investors and creditors prefer to know the market values of a firm&#x27;s assets—rather than their historical costs—because current values give them better information to make decisions.

There are commonly three pillars to valuing business entities: comparable company analyses, discounted cash flow analysis, and precedent transaction analysis. Business valuation credentials include the Chartered Business Valuator (CBV) offered by the CBV Institute, ASA and CEIV from the American Society of Appraisers, and the CVA by the National Association of Certified Valuators and Analysts.

=== Discounted cash flow method ===

This method estimates the value of an asset based on its expected future cash flows, which are discounted to the present (i.e., the present value). This concept of discounting future money is commonly known as the time value of money. For instance, an asset that matures and pays $1 in one year is worth less than $1 today. The size of the discount is based on an opportunity cost of capital and it is expressed as a percentage or discount rate.

In finance theory, the amount of the opportunity cost is based on a relation between the risk and return of some sort of investment. Classic economic theory maintains that people are rational and averse to risk. They, therefore, need an incentive to accept risk. The incentive in finance comes in the form of higher expected returns after buying a risky asset. In other words, the more risky the investment, the more return investors want from that investment. Using the same example as above, assume the first investment opportunity is a government bond that will pay interest of 5% per year and the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the government. Alternatively, the second investment opportunity is a bond issued by small company and that bond also pays annual interest of 5%. If given a choice between the two bonds, virtually all investors would buy the government bond rather than the small-firm bond because the first is less risky while paying the same interest rate as the riskier second bond. In this case, an investor has no incentive to buy the riskier second bond. Furthermore, in order to attract capital from investors, the small firm issuing the second bond must pay an interest rate higher than 5% that the government bond pays. Otherwise, no investor is likely to buy that bond and, therefore, the firm will be unable to raise capital. But by offering to pay an interest rate more than 5% the firm gives investors an incentive to buy a riskier bond.

For a valuation using the discounted cash flow method, one first estimates the future cash flows from the investment and then estimates a reasonable discount rate after considering the riskiness of those cash flows and interest rates in the capital markets. Next, one makes a calculation to compute the present value of the future cash flows.

=== Guideline companies method ===

This method determines the value of a firm by observing the prices of similar companies (called &quot;guideline companies&quot;) that sold in the market. Those sales could be shares of stock or sales of entire firms. The observed prices serve as valuation benchmarks. From the prices, one calculates price multiples such as the price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios—one or more of which used to value the firm. For example, the average price-to-earnings multiple of the guideline companies is applied to the subject firm&#x27;s earnings to estimate its value.

Many price multiples can be calculated. Most are based on a financial statement element such as a firm&#x27;s earnings (price-to-earnings) or book value (price-to-book value) but multiples can be based on other factors such as price-per-subscriber.

=== Net asset value method ===

The third-most common method of estimating the value of a company looks to the assets and liabilities of the business. At a minimum, a solvent company could shut down operations, sell off the assets, and pay the creditors. Any cash that would remain establishes a floor value for the company. This method is known as the net asset value or cost method. In general the discounted cash flows of a well-performing company exceed this floor value. Some companies, however, are worth more &quot;dead than alive&quot;, like weakly performing companies that own many tangible assets. This method can also be used to value heterogeneous portfolios of investments, as well as nonprofits, for which discounted cash flow analysis is not relevant. The valuation premise normally used is that of an orderly liquidation of the assets, although some valuation scenarios (e.g., purchase price allocation) imply an &quot;in-use&quot; valuation such as depreciated replacement cost new. This method is most appropriate in situations where there are no significant intangible assets, or when a company is voluntarily liquidating its assets as a result of ceased operations.

An alternative approach to the net asset value method is the excess earnings method. (This method was first described in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service&#x27;s &quot;Appeals and Review Memorandum&quot; 34, and later refined by Revenue Ruling 68-609.) The excess earnings method has the appraiser identify the value of tangible assets, estimate an appropriate return on those tangible assets, and subtract that return from the total return for the business, leaving the &quot;excess&quot; return, which is presumed to come from the intangible assets. An appropriate capitalization rate is applied to the excess return, resulting in the value of those intangible assets. That value is added to the value of the tangible assets and any non-operating assets, and the total is the value estimate for the business as a whole. See Clean surplus accounting, Residual income valuation.

==Specialised cases==
The approaches to valuation outlined above, are generic and will be modified for the unique positioning and characteristics

of the business in question.

In the below cases, however, more specific valuation-practices have developed 
within the investment industry.
To these, more than elsewhere, real options valuation may be applied;

see .

===Valuation of a suffering company===
Investors in a suffering company, or in other &quot;distressed securities&quot;, may intend 
(i) to restructure the business, with the valuation reflecting its potential thereafter, 
or 
(ii) to purchase the company - or its debt - at a discount, as part of an Investment Strategy aimed at realizing a profit on recovery.

Preliminary to the valuation, the financial statements are initially recast, to &quot;better reflect the firm&#x27;s indebtedness, financing costs and recurring earnings&quot;. 
Here adjustments are made to working capital, deferred capital expenditures, cost of goods sold, non-recurring professional fees and costs, above- or below-market leases, excess salaries in the case of private companies, and certain non-operating income/expense items.

The valuation is built on this base, with any of the standard market-, income-, or asset-based approaches employed. Often these are used in combination, providing a &quot;triangulation&quot; or (weighted) average.
Particularly in the second case above, the company may be valued using real options analysis, serving to complement (or sometimes replace) this standard value; see and Merton model.

As required, various adjustments are then made to this result, so as to reflect characteristics of the firm external to its profitability and cash flow. These adjustments consider any lack of marketability resulting in a discount, and re the stake in question, any control premium or lack of control discount.
Balance sheet items external to the valuation, but due to the new owners, are similarly recognized; these include excess (or restricted) cash, and other non-operating assets and liabilities.

===Valuation of a startup company===
Startup companies such as Uber, which was valued at $50 billion in early 2015, are assigned post-money valuations based on the price at which their most recent investor put money into the company. The price reflects what investors, for the most part venture capital firms, are willing to pay for a share of the firm. They are not listed on any stock market, nor is the valuation based on their assets or profits, but on their potential for success, growth, and eventually, possible profits. 
Many startup companies use internal growth factors to show their potential growth which may attribute to their valuation. 
The professional investors who fund startups are experts, but hardly infallible, see Dot-com bubble.
Valuation using discounted cash flows discusses various considerations here.

The valuation of early-stage startups 

can be more nuanced due to their lack of established track records. One common approach is using comparative valuations, although this method can be less accurate given the uniqueness of each startup. Some methods adjust the average pre-money valuation of pre-revenue startups based on various attributes within the same market. Average pre-money valuations in a particular region or sector, obtained from recent market deals, can also serve as reference points. During Series A funding rounds, the typical valuation for startups is reported to be between $10 million to $15 million.

===Valuation of intangible assets===
Valuation models can be used to value intangible assets such as for patent valuation, but also in copyrights, software, trade secrets, and customer relationships.
As economies are becoming increasingly informational, it is recognized that there is a need for new methods to value data, another intangible asset.

Valuations here are often necessary both for financial reporting and intellectual property transactions.
They are also inherent in securities analysis - listed and private - in cases where analysts must estimate the incremental contribution of patents (etc) to equity value; see next paragraph. 
Since few sales of benchmark intangible assets can ever be observed, one often values these sorts of assets using either a present value model, or by estimating the cost of recreating the asset in question. 
In some cases,
option-based techniques or decision trees may be applied.
Regardless of the method, the process is often time-consuming and costly.
If required, stock markets can give an indirect estimate of a corporation&#x27;s intangible asset value: this can be reckoned as the difference between its market capitalisation and its book value (including only hard assets), i.e. effectively its goodwill; see also PVGO.

As regards listed equity, the above techniques are most often applied in the biotech-, life sciences- and pharmaceutical sectors 

(see List of largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies).
These businesses are involved in research and development (R&amp;D), and testing, that typically takes years to complete, and where the new product may ultimately not be approved (see Contingent value rights).
Industry specialists thus apply the above techniques - and here especially rNPV - to the pipeline of products under development, and, at the same time, also estimate the impact on existing revenue streams due to expiring patents. 
For relative valuation, a specialized ratio is R&amp;D spend as a percentage of sales. 
Similar analysis may be applied to options on films re the valuation of film studios.

===Valuation of mining projects===

In mining, valuation is the process of determining the value or worth of a mining property - i.e. as distinct from a listed mining corporate. Mining valuations are sometimes required for IPOs, fairness opinions, litigation, mergers and acquisitions, and shareholder-related matters. In valuing a mining project or mining property, fair market value is the standard of value to be used.
In general,
this result will be a function of the property&#x27;s &quot;reserve&quot; - the estimated size and grade of the deposit in question - and the complexity and costs of extracting this.
&quot;CIMVal&quot; generally applied by the Toronto Stock Exchange, is widely recognized as a &quot;standard&quot; for the valuation of mining projects. (CIMVal: Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum on Valuation of Mineral Properties
The Australasian equivalent is &quot;VALMIN&quot;; 
the Southern African is &quot;SAMVAL&quot;.
These standards stress the use of the cost approach, market approach, and the income approach, depending on the stage of development of the mining property or project; 
see for further discussion and context.
Real Options analysis
is sometimes 
 
used when there is a need to evaluate the project under different scenarios from inception.

Analyzing listed mining corporates (and other resource companies) is also specialized,
as the valuation requires a good understanding of the company&#x27;s overall assets, its operational business model as well as key market drivers,
and an understanding of that sector of the stock market.
Re the latter, a distinction is usually made based on size and financial capabilities; see .
*The price of a &quot;Junior&quot; mining stock, typically having one asset, will at its early stages be linked to the result of its feasibility study; later, the price will be a function of that mine&#x27;s viability and value, largely applying the above techniques.
*A &quot;Major&quot;, on the other hand, has numerous properties, and the contents of any single deposit will impact stock value in a limited fashion; this due to diversification, access to funding, and, also, since the share price inheres goodwill. Typically, then, the exposure is more to the market value of each mineral in the portfolio, than to the individual properties.

===Valuing financial services firms===
There are two main difficulties with valuing financial services firms.
 

The first is that the cash flows to a financial service firm cannot be easily estimated, since capital expenditures, working capital and debt are not clearly defined: 
&quot;debt for a financial service firm is more akin to raw material than to a source of capital; the notion of cost of capital and enterprise value may be meaningless as a consequence.&quot;
(See related discussion re. the risk management of financial- vs non-financial firms.)
The second is that these firms operate under a highly regulated environment, and valuation assumptions (and model outputs) must incorporate regulatory limits, at least as &quot;bounds&quot;.

The approach taken for a DCF valuation, is to then &quot;remove&quot; debt from the valuation, by discounting at the cost of equity either free cash flow to equity (net income less any reinvestment in regulatory capital) or excess return; a dividend based valuation is often employed. This is in contrast to the more typical approach of discounting free cash flow to the &quot;Firm&quot; where EBITDA less capital expenditures and working capital is discounted at the weighted average cost of capital, which incorporates the cost of debt.

For a multiple based valuation, similarly, price to earnings is preferred to EV/EBITDA.
Here, there are also industry-specific measures used to compare between investments and within sub-sectors; this, once normalized by market cap (or other appropriate result), and recognizing regulatory differences: 
*Insurance companies: embedded value and actuarial reserves
*Banking sector: net interest margin and provision for credit losses
*Wealth- and investment management firms: assets under management
*Investment banks: price to tangible book value and return on tangible equity.

==Mismarking==

Mismarking in securities valuation takes place when the value that is assigned to securities does not reflect what the securities are actually worth, due to intentional fraudulent mispricing.

Mismarking misleads investors and fund executives about how much the securities in a securities portfolio managed by a trader are worth (the securities&#x27; net asset value, or NAV), and thus misrepresents performance.

When a rogue trader engages in mismarking, it allows him to obtain a higher bonus from the financial firm for which he works, where his bonus is calculated by the performance of the securities portfolio that he is managing.

<text>Sir George Cunningham Buchanan (20 April 1865 – 14 April 1940) was a British civil engineer particularly associated with harbour works in Burma, Iraq and Bombay, during the early years of the 20th century.

Buchanan first came to prominence in 1905 when he collaborated with Patrick Meik on designs for the Rangoon River training works in Burma; Meik was consulting engineer and Buchanan was chief engineer. The project reclaimed some 1.2 km² of land behind a wall of rubble long and wide.

At the start of the First World War in 1914, Buchanan was working in India, until called to support the British Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force at Basra in Mesopotamia (now part of modern-day Iraq) with advice on improving shipping channels into the port. After many delays, he was finally able to design and supervise construction of a line of wharves complete with cranes, sheds, roads and railway lines. In 1917, Buchanan was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and was knighted. However, he had already distanced himself from his compatriots by his reputation for egotism and outspokenness, and jealousy of his enormous salary as Director-General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. His military counterpart, General MacMunn, wrote that he: &quot;irritated everyone who came across him or worked for him&quot;. Buchanan later wrote a critical book about the military campaign and his own part in turning it around, &quot;The Tragedy of Mesopotamia&quot; (1938).

Buchanan was a member of the Indian Munitions Board from 1917 – 1919. In 1920, working with Patrick’s brother Charles Meik in a firm renamed CS Meik and Buchanan in 1920, Buchanan was invited to Bombay to investigate a potential land reclamation project, the Bombay Backbay reclamation. The costs of the huge and ambitious scheme, and the time it would take to complete, soon escalated out of control, and a subsequent enquiry blamed Sir George (the project became known as Lloyd’s Folly, after Sir George Lloyd, then governor of Bombay).

At the same time, Sir George Buchanan was alleged to have &quot;criticised and condemned the proposals of another engineer and had offered his services uninvited&quot; – an action which saw him expelled from the British Institution of Civil Engineers. His later career was largely focused overseas, notably in Australia where he prepared an influential report on the country&#x27;s ports in 1926 at the request of the Federal Government.

His ignominious departure from UK engineering circles meant that the name &#x27;Buchanan&#x27; had to be deleted from the company name in 1923 when the firm became CS Meik and Halcrow (William Halcrow had been a partner in the firm from the previous year and went on to take a more controlling interest in what became the Halcrow Group).

Sir George’s nephew, Sir Colin Buchanan was a pioneer in transport planning.

<doc id="347113" wikidata="Q1413754" url="?curid=347113" title="Tiger team">
<text>A tiger team is a team of specialists assembled to work on a specific goal, or to solve a particular problem.

==Origin of the term==

A 1964 paper entitled &quot;Program Management in Design and Development&quot; used the term &quot;tiger teams&quot; and defined it as &quot;a team of undomesticated and uninhibited technical specialists, selected for their experience, energy, and imagination, and assigned to track down relentlessly every possible source of failure in a spacecraft subsystem or simulation&quot;. Walter C. Williams gave this definition in response to the question &quot;How best can advancements in reliability/maintainability state-of-the-art be attained and used with compressed schedules?&quot; Williams was an engineer at the Manned Spacecraft Center and part of the Edwards Air Force Base National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. 

The paper consists of anecdotes and answers to questions from a panel on improving issues in program management concerning testing and quality assurance in aerospace vehicle development and production. The panel consisted of Williams, Col. J. R. Dempsey of General Dynamics, Lt. Gen. W. A. Davis from the Ballistic Systems Div., Norton Air Force Base, A. S. Crossfield from North American Aviation.

==Examples==
* A tiger team was crucial to the Apollo 13 crewed lunar mission in 1970. During the mission, part of the Apollo 13 Service Module malfunctioned and exploded. A team of specialists led by NASA Flight and Mission Operations Director Gene Kranz was formed to address the resulting problems and bring the astronauts back to Earth safely. Kranz and the members of his &quot;White Team&quot;, later designated the &quot;Tiger Team&quot;, received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their efforts in the Apollo 13 mission.
* In security work, a tiger team is a group that tests an organization&#x27;s ability to protect its assets by attempting to defeat its physical or information security. In this context, the tiger team is often a permanent team as security is typically an ongoing priority. For example, one implementation of an information security tiger team approach divides the team into two co-operating groups: one for vulnerability research, which finds and researches the technical aspects of a vulnerability, and one for vulnerability management, which manages communication and feedback between the team and the organization, as well as ensuring each discovered vulnerability is tracked throughout its life-cycle and ultimately resolved.
* An initiative involving tiger teams was implemented by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) under then-Secretary James D. Watkins. From 1989 through 1992 the DOE formed tiger teams to assess 35 DOE facilities for compliance with environment, safety, and health requirements. Beginning in October 1991 smaller tiger teams were formed to perform more detailed follow-up assessments to focus on the most pressing issues. 
* The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) puts together &quot;tiger teams&quot; of engineers and scientists from multiple NASA centers to assist solving complex problems when requested by a project or program.

<doc id="347123" wikidata="Q179422" url="?curid=347123" title="Lymph">
<text>Lymph () is the fluid that flows through the lymphatic system, a system composed of lymph vessels (channels) and intervening lymph nodes whose function, like the venous system, is to return fluid from the tissues to be recirculated. At the origin of the fluid-return process, interstitial fluid—the fluid between the cells in all body tissues—enters the lymph capillaries. This lymphatic fluid is then transported via progressively larger lymphatic vessels through lymph nodes, where substances are removed by tissue lymphocytes and circulating lymphocytes are added to the fluid, before emptying ultimately into the right or the left subclavian vein, where it mixes with central venous blood.

Because it is derived from interstitial fluid, with which blood and surrounding cells continually exchange substances, lymph undergoes continual change in composition. It is generally similar to blood plasma, which is the fluid component of blood. Lymph returns proteins and excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream. Lymph also transports fats from the digestive system (beginning in the lacteals) to the blood via chylomicrons.

Bacteria may enter the lymph channels and be transported to lymph nodes, where the bacteria are destroyed. Metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;lymph&quot; is derived from the name of the ancient Roman deity of fresh water, Lympha.

==Structure==

Lymph has a composition similar but not identical to that of blood plasma. Lymph that leaves a lymph node is richer in lymphocytes than blood plasma is. The lymph formed in the human digestive system called chyle is rich in triglycerides (fat), and looks milky white because of its lipid content.

==Development==
Blood supplies nutrients and important metabolites to the cells of a tissue and collects back the waste products they produce, which requires exchange of respective constituents between the blood and tissue cells. This exchange is not direct, but instead occurs through an intermediary called interstitial fluid, which occupies the spaces between cells. As the blood and the surrounding cells continually add and remove substances from the interstitial fluid, its composition continually changes. Water and solutes can pass between the interstitial fluid and blood via diffusion across gaps in capillary walls called intercellular clefts; thus, the blood and interstitial fluid are in dynamic equilibrium with each other.

Interstitial fluid forms at the arterial (coming from the heart) end of capillaries because of the higher pressure of blood compared to veins, and most of it returns to its venous ends and venules; the rest (up to 10%) enters the lymph capillaries as lymph. (Prior to entry, this fluid is referred to as the lymph obligatory load, or LOL, as the lymphatic system is effectively &quot;obliged&quot; to return it to the cardiovascular network.) The lymph when formed is a watery clear liquid with the same composition as the interstitial fluid. However, as it flows through the lymph nodes it comes in contact with blood, and tends to accumulate more cells (particularly, lymphocytes) and proteins.

==Functions==
===Components===
Lymph returns proteins and excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream. Lymph may pick up bacteria and transport them to lymph nodes, where the bacteria are destroyed. Metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph. Lymph also transports fats from the digestive system (beginning in the lacteals) to the blood via chylomicrons.

===Circulation===

Tubular vessels transport lymph back to the blood, ultimately replacing the volume lost during the formation of the interstitial fluid. These channels are the lymphatic channels, or simply &quot;lymphatics&quot;.

Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed. In some amphibian and reptilian species, the lymphatic system has central pumps, called lymph hearts, which typically exist in pairs, but humans and other mammals do not have a central lymph pump. Lymph transport is slow and sporadic. Despite low pressure, lymph movement occurs due to peristalsis (propulsion of the lymph due to alternate contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue), valves, and compression during contraction of adjacent skeletal muscle and arterial pulsation.

Lymph that enters the lymph vessels from the interstitial spaces usually does not flow backwards along the vessels because of the presence of valves. If excessive hydrostatic pressure develops within the lymph vessels, though, some fluid can leak back into the interstitial spaces and contribute to formation of edema.

The flow of lymph in the thoracic duct in an average resting person usually approximates 100ml per hour. Accompanied by another ~25ml per hour in other lymph vessels, the total lymph flow in the body is about 4 to 5 litres per day. This can be elevated several fold while exercising. It is estimated that without lymphatic flow, the average resting person would die within 24 hours.

==Clinical significance==

Histopathological examination of the lymph system is used as a screening tool for immune system analysis in conjunction with pathological changes in other organ systems and clinical pathology to assess disease status. Although histological assessment of the lymph system does not directly measure immune function, it can be combined with identification of chemical biomarkers to determine underlying changes in the diseased immune system.

==As a growth medium==
In 1907 the zoologist Ross Granville Harrison demonstrated the growth of frog nerve cell processes in a medium of clotted lymph. It is made up of lymph nodes and vessels.

In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert grew vaccinia virus in fragments of tissue culture from guinea pig cornea grown in lymph.

<doc id="347128" wikidata="Q5175070" url="?curid=347128" title="Costate equation">
<text>The costate equation is related to the state equation used in optimal control. It is also referred to as auxiliary, adjoint, influence, or multiplier equation. It is stated as a vector of first order differential equations
:formula_1
where the right-hand side is the vector of partial derivatives of the negative of the Hamiltonian with respect to the state variables.

== Interpretation ==
The costate variables formula_2 can be interpreted as Lagrange multipliers associated with the state equations. The state equations represent constraints of the minimization problem, and the costate variables represent the marginal cost of violating those constraints; in economic terms the costate variables are the shadow prices.

== Solution ==
The state equation is subject to an initial condition and is solved forwards in time. The costate equation must satisfy a transversality condition and is solved backwards in time, from the final time towards the beginning. For more details see Pontryagin&#x27;s maximum principle.

<doc id="347136" wikidata="Q756750" url="?curid=347136" title="List of TCP and UDP port numbers">
<text>This is a list of TCP and UDP port numbers used by protocols for operation of network applications. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) only need one port for bidirectional traffic. TCP usually uses port numbers that match the services of the corresponding UDP implementations, if they exist, and vice versa.

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for maintaining the official assignments of port numbers for specific uses, However, many unofficial uses of both well-known and registered port numbers occur in practice. Similarly, many of the official assignments refer to protocols that were never or are no longer in common use. This article lists port numbers and their associated protocols that have experienced significant uptake.

==Table legend==
==Well-known ports==

The port numbers in the range from 0 to 1023 (0 to 210 − 1) are the &quot;well-known ports&quot; or &quot;system ports&quot;. They are used by system processes that provide widely used types of network services. On Unix-like operating systems, a process must execute with superuser privileges to be able to bind a network socket to an IP address using one of the well-known ports.


==Registered ports==

The range of port numbers from 1024 to 49151 (210 to 215 + 214 − 1) are the registered ports. They are assigned by IANA for specific service upon application by a requesting entity. On most systems, registered ports can be used without superuser privileges.


==Dynamic, private or ephemeral ports==

The range 49152–65535 (215 + 214 to 216 − 1), 16 384 ports, contains dynamic or private ports that cannot be registered with IANA. This range is used for private or customized services, for temporary purposes, and for automatic allocation of ephemeral ports.

<text>The 2003 Newfoundland and Labrador general election was held on October 21, 2003, to elect the 48 members of the 45th General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador. The election was called on September 29 by Premier Roger Grimes of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Opinion polls==
==Results==

This election marked only the third change of government in the 54 years since the province joined Canada. The Liberals, led by Roger Grimes, were soundly defeated by the Danny Williams-led Progressive Conservative Party, who took almost three-quarters of the seats in the House of Assembly and well over half of the popular vote. The Liberals lost seven of their 17 Cabinet ministers, along with the Speaker of the House, from the preceding government. Jack Harris and the New Democrats hopes to increase their seat total from two were frustrated, although their incumbents were re-elected.

<doc id="347140" wikidata="Q1779946" url="?curid=347140" title="Navvy">
<text>Navvy, a clipping of navigator (UK) or navigational engineer (US), is particularly applied to describe the manual labourers working on major civil engineering projects and occasionally in North America to refer to mechanical shovels and earth moving machinery. The term was coined in the late 18th century in Great Britain when numerous canals were being built, which were also sometimes known as &quot;navigations&quot;.

== Nationalities ==
A study of 19th-century British railway contracts by David Brooke, coinciding with census returns, showed that the great majority of navvies in Britain were English. He also stated that &quot;only the ubiquitous Irish can be regarded as a truly international force in railway construction,&quot; but the Irish were only about 30% of the navvies.

By 1818, high wages in North America attracted many Irish workers to become a major part of the workforce on the construction of the Erie Canal in New York State and similar projects. Navvies also participated in building canals in Britain, and by the 20th century, they were the predominant workforce.

== Migration from canal to railway projects ==
The construction of canals in Britain was superseded by contracts to construct railway projects from 1830 onward, which developed into the railway manias, and the same term was applied to the workmen employed on building rail tracks, their tunnels, cuttings and embankments. There were 250,000 navvies employed during the apex of British railway expansion efforts.

Navvies working on railway projects typically continued to work using hand tools, supplemented with explosives (particularly when tunnelling, and to clear obdurate difficulties). Steam-powered mechanical diggers or excavators (initially called &#x27;steam navvies&#x27;) were available in the 1840s, but were not considered cost effective until much later in the 19th century, especially in Britain and Europe where experienced labourers were easily obtained and comparatively cheap. Elsewhere, for example in the United States and Canada, where labour was more scarce and expensive, machines were used. In the States the machine tradition became so strong that &quot;[...] the word navvy is understood to mean not a man but a steam shovel.&quot;

== Navvy culture ==
Being a navvy labourer became a cultural experience unto its own during the 19th century. Most accounts chronicling the life of a navvy worker come from local newspapers portraying navvies as drunk and unruly men, but fail to provide any mention that families were formed and raised despite the navvy&#x27;s travelling demands.

The navvies working on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway were paid daily and their pay reputedly went on ale, leaving little for food. When the workers were unfit to work, monies were subtracted from their wages and meal tokens were issued. These tokens could be handed in at meal caravans for a bowl of soup and a portion of bread. At first the token was a slip of paper called a &quot;flimsy&quot; because of its thickness. In today&#x27;s terms it would be similar to a grade called &quot;bank paper&quot;. As these tokens could be copied by the forgers, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway supplied its contractors with six-sided food tokens that were surrendered for meals. These were cut from brass and had the initials LMR stamped upon them. This reduced the problems of drunken navvies and eliminated the local farm labourers freeloading from the food caravans. Tokens and a description of their use can be found in the Museum of Science &amp; Industry in Manchester.

In the mid-1800s some efforts were made by evangelical Anglicans led by Elizabeth Garnett to administer to the perceived religious needs of navvy settlements, with preaching, a newsletter and charity work. The construction tycoon Sir Samuel Morton Peto encouraged religious services for his workforce, as well as providing some social services to the navvy populations.

=== Living conditions ===
Many of the navvies employed to build the railways in England during the early part of the 19th century lived in squalid temporary accommodations referred to as &quot;shanty towns.&quot; Due in part to constructing through rural areas, and, in part, the navvies negative reputation, two-thirds of the railway construction sites had housing erected specifically for the navvy. Initially, the housing &quot;huts&quot; were constructed quickly and meant to be temporary. As a result, little thought was given to comfort, let alone sanitation, which was actually a prominent issue for everyone during the Victorian era. Shanties &quot;were clearly unhealthy places in which to live, and it was not uncommon for a navvy community to be overtaken by cholera, dysentery or typhus.&quot;

In addition to these unhygienic living conditions, navvies shared housing, some even sleeping on floors. The majority of navvies were Englishmen, with 30% of the group being Irish. While this ratio varied from navvy shanty town to shanty town, sleeping arrangements were segregated. In at least one documented instance, a riot broke out between the two nationalities in one navvy shanty town, causing local magistrates to arrest 12 individuals. Though, this is not necessarily indicative of relations between the English and Irish in all navvy gangs.

Over time, housing arrangements progressed positively, with the structures being built with more care, and even attached land being offered for use so navvies and their families could grow their own food.

=== Working conditions for railway navvies ===
In addition to their nomadic living arrangements, navvies confronted varying degrees of dangerous work environments that depended both on the terrain, and the locals&#x27; reception of them.

Due to limited safety protocols, navvies were frequently injured or killed on the job. For each mile of rail laid, there was an average of three work-related deaths, which was even higher when working on sections that required tunnelling. The particularly high incidence of navvy mortality during the construction of the Woodhead Tunnel prompted the Enquiry of 1846, which eventually led to the need for the formation of and evaluation by a Select Committee on Railway Labourers 1846.

The natural tension between locals and outsiders sometimes bred distrust of the navvies. Occasionally, this strain between the two would result in violence such as riots, or death. One such instance occurred at Sampford Peverell in 1811. John Chave, a local who was regionally well known for living in a &quot;haunted house,&quot; was approached by a group of drunk navvies. The encounter left Chave feeling threatened, so after proceeding home with the navvy group in tow, he used a gun to shoot a warning shot into the crowd, which hit and killed one of the group members causing a riot to ensue. The death was later deemed a justifiable homicide. As newspapers reported on similar conflicts, anticipated tensions grew for the local inhabitants of the regions the navvy worked in, when they arrived.

In many cases, though, as time passed, the local establishments benefited from navvy business, which strengthened relations, and even forged friendships with an occasional local helping teach reading and writing to some navvies.

=== Navvy slang ===

Many slang terms were used as a method of communication among navvies, which facilitated bonding amongst them, as it was frequently used for a laugh, or as a method of asking for someone to watch your back, while you sneaked a smoke break, or went off for a drink.

Much of the terminology appears to be fluid, relying primarily on rhyming with the intended meaning. One example provided by Daniel William Barrett, in his book, &quot;Life and Work Among The Navvies&quot;, contains the following navvy slang; &quot;&#x27;now, Jack, I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to get a tiddley wink of pig&#x27;s ear; keep your mince pies on the Billy Gorman.&#x27;&quot; This means the speaker&#x27;s going for a beer, and asking the person being addressed, to keep his eyes on the foreman. Their exclusionary code usually left outsiders confused.

== Contemporary use of the term &quot;navvy&quot; ==
* An excavating machine or steam shovel, as noted above.
* In Britain, &quot;navvy&quot; sometimes means a workman digging a hole in a public road to get access to buried services such as gas mains or water mains.
* In Britain, the name &quot;navvies&quot; is sometimes given to members of the Inland Waterways Protection Society and other canal restoration societies.
* In Australia, the term &quot;navvy&quot; is still applied to railway workers. Some areas of the country, particularly towns and cities along the sugarcane belt of the state of Queensland, still employ teams of navvies on a permanent basis to lay and maintain the state&#x27;s narrow-gauge cane-train tracks. Whereas Council workers who work on general civic projects advise of their worksites with fluorescent orange &quot;Workers Ahead&quot; signage, navvies use pale blue &quot;Navvies at Work&quot; signs.
* In British Columbia, &quot;navvy jack&quot; is a common term in construction and landscaping trades and in their respective supply stores for ″ and ″ crushed rock and sand to be mixed with Portland cement to make concrete. The usage derives from &quot;Navvy Jack&quot;, by ordinary name Jack Thomas, a former navvy who used a rowboat to mine good-quality gravel from beaches in West Vancouver and infrequently ran a rowboat-ferry for settlers on Burrard Inlet and English Bay.
* A new public space in Archway, London, an area that was historically home to the city&#x27;s navvies, was named &quot;Navigator Square&quot; in 2017.

== In popular culture ==
* Julian Barnes&#x27;s 1995 short story &quot;Junction&quot; (published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, 19 Sep 1994) concerns English navvies building the Paris–Le Havre railway (see the collection &quot;Cross Channel&quot;).

<doc id="347144" wikidata="Q1634834" url="?curid=347144" title="River Weaver">
<text>The River Weaver is a river, navigable in its lower reaches, running in a curving route anti-clockwise across west Cheshire, northern England. Improvements to the river to make it navigable were authorised in 1720 and the work, which included eleven locks, was completed in 1732. An unusual clause in the enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that profits should be given to the County of Cheshire for the improvement of roads and bridges, but the navigation was not initially profitable, and it was 1775 before the first payments were made. Trade continued to rise, and by 1845, over £500,000 had been given to the county.

The major trade was salt. The arrival of the Trent and Mersey Canal at Anderton in 1773 was detrimental to the salt trade at first, but ultimately beneficial, as salt was tipped down chutes from the canal into barges on the river navigation. Access to the river was improved in 1810 by the Weston Canal, which provided a link to Weston Point, where boats could reach the River Mersey at most states of the tide, as the water was deeper. The navigation was completely reconstructed between 1870 and 1900, with the original locks being replaced by five much larger locks, capable of handling 1000-tonne coasters. With the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal, a new lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which gave direct access to the ship canal without having to pass through the docks at Weston Point. All water from the river entered the canal nearby, and any surplus was released into the Mersey through the Weaver sluices, which were located just upstream of the junction.

A notable feature is the Anderton Boat Lift, which is near Northwich, and links the Weaver with the Trent and Mersey Canal some above. It was opened in 1875, to allow canal boats to reach the Weaver, and although closed on safety grounds in 1983, it was refurbished and reopened in 2002. Many of the structures of the navigation are of historical importance, and are grade II listed. They include the Hayhurst swing bridge and Northwich Town bridge, which are believed to be the earliest swing bridges powered by electricity. Both have a sectional pontoon, which is immersed in the river and carries about 80 per cent of the weight of the bridge. Dutton Horse Bridge, which carries the towpath over the weir stream at Dutton, is one of the earliest surviving laminated timber structures. Dutton railway viaduct, which was built by Joseph Locke and George Stephenson for the Grand Junction Railway, is grade II* listed, and a civic celebration was held on its completion, as there had been no deaths and no serious injuries to the workers during its construction.

==Route==
The River Weaver is around long. From its source in the hills of west Cheshire just south of Peckforton Castle, and within a few hundred metres of the source of the River Gowy it initially flows in a south-easterly direction towards the border with Shropshire, fed by tributaries some of which rise in north Shropshire. The first of three canal crossings occurs just before the village of Wrenbury, when the Llangollen Canal crosses its course. After flowing through the village, it passes to the west of the Cheshire village of Audlem, where it starts to flow approximately northwards across the Cheshire Plain. Shortly afterwards, the Shropshire Union Canal is carried over it on Moss Hall aqueduct. The first significant town on the river is the market town of Nantwich, where a watermill was a feature from the 13th century; 100m further north, an early 19th-century stone bridge, with a single span, crosses the river. Continuing northwards, it passes under the Middlewich Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal before the village of Church Minshull. The aqueduct carrying the canal was designed by Thomas Telford and was built of brick with stone bands between 1827 and 1833. The river flows through a central arch, and there are flood relief arches on each side of the channel. The two waterways run roughly parallel for several miles. They diverge near Winsford, the current head of navigation, and at Northwich the river turns to flow north-west across north Cheshire.

Below Winsford, the course of the river has been altered several times, by the construction of cuts and locks, to enable small ships to trade on it. The river formerly joined the River Mersey at Weston Marsh, but since the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, begun in 1887, it has flowed into the canal, from where surplus water enters the Mersey by the Weaver sluices, just upstream of the junction. The tidal river section below Frodsham has been bypassed by the Weston Canal since 1810, and is no longer navigable, as Frodsham Lock is derelict.

==History==
The river runs through the Cheshire salt-producing area, but was not deep enough to allow boats to reach the salt mines. It was tidal for around to Pickering&#x27;s wharf, and salt from the mines was carried by pack horse to the wharf, where it was loaded into barges. These used the ebbing tide to carry them back down the river. By the early 17th century, coal was being transported into the area so that it could be used to evaporate the brine, and as the industry expanded, there were calls to improve the river to simplify this trade. There was opposition to the initial schemes, however, from landowners who feared flooding and from carriers who feared a loss of trade, which resulted in Bills laid before Parliament in 1711, 1715, 1718 and 1720 being defeated.

===Construction===
In 1720 the first act of Parliament, the (7 Geo. 1. St. 1. c. 10) to authorise improvements to the river was obtained by three gentlemen of Cheshire. The act was dated 23 March 1721 and authorised work between Frodsham bridge and Winsford bridge. Rates for tolls were set, which were to be reduced by 20 per cent once the cost of construction had been met, and profits were then to be used to maintain bridges and highways within Cheshire. Each year the justices of the peace were to meet to decide which structures should benefit from this source of revenue. The act included powers to improve the Witton Brook from the Weaver to Witton Bridge. Following a plea by the owner of brine workings near Middlewich, who felt they would be disadvantaged by the new navigation, the River Dane Navigation Act 1720 (7 Geo. 1. St. 1. c. 17) was obtained on 7 June 1721 to authorise improvements to the River Dane, but did not result in any work being undertaken.

Progress was slow, as only Richard Vernon of the original three undertakers was actively engaged on the project, and he could not reach agreement with the commissioners. The stalemate was broken when Vernon died in 1726, and new undertakers were appointed. The work on the Weaver was completed by 1732, at a cost of £15,885. Eleven timber locks and weirs had been constructed, but no work had been carried out on the Witton Brook. The river had been improved by dredging and the construction of a series of cuts, with locks and weirs to manage the drop of around over the between Winsford and the River Mersey. Barges of up to 40 tons could reach Winsford, and boats called Weaver flats were the predominant vessels. These either sailed up the river, or were bow-hauled by teams of men.
The navigation was not initially profitable, and the amount of money owing to the undertakers gradually rose to a peak of £19,659 by 1740. Toll receipts improved, and by 1757, the debts had been reduced to £9,809. In September 1757, merchants from Liverpool complained about the run-down state of the navigation to Liverpool Corporation, who offered to pay for a survey. The merchants then offered to take over the navigation, but the commissioners wanted to keep control of it, and paid £17,000 to the undertakers, which repaid the outstanding debt and bought the navigation rights. The deal was completed on 11 October 1758. The commissioners largely ignored the survey which had been carried out by Henry Berry, and decided to enlarge the locks to wide. Work began on a new cut, lock and weir at Pickerings, but in 1759, the navigation was cut in half by the collapse of a salt pit at Northwich. The commissioners discovered that they could not sue for damages, as the provisions of the 1721 act no longer covered the way in which they were operating, and so a further act of Parliament, the (33 Geo. 2. c. 49) was obtained on 22 May 1760. This changed the way in which the debts were managed, and gave the commissioners powers to sue and to appoint a management committee. It also stipulated that all locks should be with a draught of , but the actual depth exceeded .

Debts continued to increase, as the commissioners borrowed more money to fund the improvements. The new weir and lock at Pickerings failed in 1761 and both had to be rebuilt. Work had started on Witton Brook in 1756, but the plans were revised in 1764 to increase the navigable depth to , and this work was completed in 1765.

===Development===
The proposed Trent and Mersey Canal was seen as a threat by the Trustees of the Navigation, for it ran parallel to the River Weaver for some distance near Anderton. However, the commissioners pressed on with upgrading the river, completing new locks at Barnton in 1771 and at Acton Bridge in 1778. They also set about repaying their debts, which were liquidated in July 1775, resulting in some of the profits being given to the County of Cheshire, as stated in the original act of Parliament.

The Trent and Mersey was completed in May 1777, and had an immediate effect on trade, which dropped by 25 per cent, particularly in the Winsford area. The downturn was short lived, as the salt trade developed, figures reaching their former levels by 1783, and climbing another 40 per cent to 171,719 tons by 1790. Ultimately, the Trent and Mersey generated significant trade for the Navigation, for in 1793 a system of chutes was constructed at Anderton, to enable salt from narrow boats on the canal to be tipped into Weaver flats moored in a dock some below the level of the canal.

The steady increase in traffic encouraged the trustees to press on with improvements. Witton Brook was widened in 1788, and the lock was raised, but subsidence caused by the salt mining resulted in a new lock being needed in 1826. A longer-term solution was provided by the decision to move Northwich lock to a new site below the town. When the work was finished in 1829, Witton Brook lock was no longer necessary, and was removed. New cuts and locks were built through the 1790s at Vale Royal, Newbridge, Hartford and Hunts, and Butty Meadow lock was removed. In response to petitions, the construction of a towing path suitable for horses was started in 1792, and was completed as far as Anderton by mid-1793. It was later extended to Winsford, and bow-hauling of boats by men was ended.

===The Weston Canal===

Below Frodsham, barges carrying salt had to negotiate a tidal section of the river to reach the Mersey, from where the cargo would be taken to Liverpool or Manchester for distribution worldwide. Water levels were inadequate for the Mersey Flats at neap tides, resulting in them having to wait for days at Frodsham. In 1796, users of the navigation suggested that it should be extended to Weston Point, where the water was deeper. The trustees wanted to pay for this extension by raising tolls, but the users objected, and it took several years to work out a deal which suited both parties. Finally, the trustees obtained a third act of Parliament on 8 August 1807, which authorised the construction of a cut from Frodsham to Weston Point. The trustees insisted that their own engineer, John Johnson, should oversee the work, but the project was too large for him, and ran over time and budget. He was sacked in 1809, after serving the navigation for 29 years, and Thomas Telford was asked to complete the work. He managed the project with Samuel Fowls as engineer. At Weston Point, a new lock connected the cut to a basin, and tide gates connect the basin to the Mersey. This cut was called the Weston Canal and was completed in 1810. A fourth act of Parliament was obtained on 2 May 1825, which altered some of the details of the previous act of Parliament, and the (10 Geo. 4. c. lxx) of 22 May 1829 noted that the Weston Canal had been completed. It stated that the trustees had built a basin, piers and a lighthouse at Weston Point, that the Weston Canal was officially a branch of the River Weaver, and that the trustees would make no additional charges for using the section. No tolls had been collected since 1816, once the construction costs had been repaid.

===Progress===
The trustees investigated the idea of a junction canal from Winsford to the Middlewich branch of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal in 1830, but felt that water supply would be a problem. New cuts were constructed at Barnton, Crowton and Aston Grange between 1832 and 1835, and they then planned to construct a second lock beside each of the original locks. William Cubbitt was asked for advice on whether the river could be adapted for seagoing ships, and although he said it could, he did not think it would be cost effective. Work was then started on making the river deep throughout, and building double locks suitable for 100-ton vessels which were . By 1845, Winnington, Acton and Hunts locks had been improved. Trade was good, with tolls generating £38,363 in 1845 from the carriage of 778,715 tons of goods. All of the improvements had been funded from the toll revenue, and over £500,000 had been given to the County of Cheshire, in line with the original act of Parliament.

Further improvements to make the river suitable for coasters began in 1856, when Edward Leader Williams was appointed as engineer. He oversaw the complete reconstruction of the navigation between 1870 and 1900, a programme which was designed to ensure that the river remained attractive to carriers, and which ensured its profitability. The 12 locks of the 1830s were replaced by five much larger locks, and most of the bridges were replaced by swing bridges, which enabled coasters of up to 1000 tons to use the river.

Construction of a connection between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new lift was built over the top of the old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J. A. Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.

It had been expected that use of the chutes to transfer salt between the canal and the river would cease once the lift was opened, but by the turn of the 19th century, although there were 190,000 tons of cargo using the lift each year, 38,000 tons of salt were still being transferred by chute. From the middle of the 19th century, some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways, and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade, but as that source of revenue declined, a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich, which became the major source of income for the Navigation.

===Locks===

The locks on the river are paired, with two lock chambers side by side, and in most cases the larger lock also has intermediate gates, so that ships of varying length can be accommodated, without undue waste of water. The maximum size of the locks is above the Anderton boat lift, and below it. The lock at Weston Point Docks is slightly narrower, at . The boat lift is designed for canal craft rather than ships, and so can hold vessels up to with a draught of .

==Connections==

Access to the navigation was improved for traditional canal boats with the opening of the Runcorn and Weston Canal, which was completed in 1859. The canal left the Weston Canal at Weston Point, and provided a link to Runcorn Docks, near which two flights of locks connected to the Bridgewater Canal. This link was severed in 1966, when the Runcorn to Widnes road bridge was constructed. Half of the Runcorn and Weston Canal was filled in at the same time.

Significant change occurred when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although it is possible for pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.

Situated just below Northwich, the Anderton Boat Lift is now the normal route for leisure boats to reach the river. Following its closure in 1983, a trust was created to campaign for its restoration. The lift became a scheduled monument in 1994, and work eventually started on its refurbishment in 1999. It reopened in 2002, and is once more hydraulically powered. The use of modern hydraulic fluids is expected to prevent the problem of corrosion suffered when it was originally built.

The navigation is managed by the Canal and River Trust (CRT) as far as Winsford Bridge. Beyond this are Winsford Bottom Flash and Winsford Top Flash. Both are shallow lakes, resulting from subsidence in the underlying salt mines. It is possible for some canal boats to explore the Bottom Flash, but the depth of water is limited, and great care is needed. The Flash is used for yacht racing by the Winsford Flash Sailing Club, which is based on the lake.

==Tourism==
The Weaver is a river of contrasts, with quiet wooded reaches and heavily industrialised sites. Commercial shipping has largely ceased, but the ship-sized locks remain. For leisure boaters, most of the movable bridges provide a clearance of , although the swing bridge at Newbridge, on the Vale Royal cut, only has headroom of . Boats which require the bridges to be opened must give prior notice. There is a salt museum at Northwich, which was renamed as the Weaver Hall Museum and Workhouse in 2010, to reflect its expanding scope and the historic building in which it is housed, and a visitor centre at the Anderton lift, which is popular with boaters and non-boaters alike. There are, however, few facilities for the recreational boater.

Rowing is popular on the River Weaver, with competitive clubs in Runcorn, Northwich, and Acton Bridge (The Grange School). Fishing is another pastime which takes place along the river. Several clubs lease fishing rights for different parts of the river from British Waterways, as it holds populations of bream, three types of carp, chub, dace, eels, perch, pike, roach, rudd and tench. Fishing matches are regularly organised at weekends.

The lower reaches of the Weaver between Frodsham railway viaduct and the Manchester Ship Canal are used for sailing. The Weaver Sailing Club is based at Frodsham, and uses a stretch of the river for activities which include youth training and racing of several types of dinghy sailboats. Their training courses are accredited by the Royal Yachting Association.

==Structures==
The navigation has a number of structures which, because of their age, have historic value and are listed on the Listed Building register. At Vale Royal, the lock built in 1860 was retained as a sluice channel when a new lock was built in the 1890s. A swing bridge crosses the chamber. The sluice at the upstream end is supported by two cast iron arches on rusticated piers. A swing bridge, made of wood and iron, crosses the small lock, which was the large lock until the construction of the new large lock in the 1890s. This has three sets of gates, and could accommodate a train of four barges when the outer gates were used. Again, a swing bridge crosses the lock. The gates are opened by a Pelton water turbine mechanism, and other features include a water levelling mechanism and a system for removing rubbish from behind the gates using jets of water which are controlled mechanically. The lock keeper&#x27;s cottage is also grade II listed. It was built in the 1850s, but was moved northwards by during the 1890 reconstruction.

Below the locks, a five-arched red sandstone viaduct, constructed in 1837, crosses the valley. It was built by Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt&#x27;s locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again the movement of the gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.

Northwich railway viaduct spans both the lock cut and the weir stream, and was built in the 1860s. It consists of 48 round arches, constructed of blue bricks and red sandstone, with iron spans over the channels. It is around long, provides of headroom over the navigation, and also crosses the River Dane. Hayhurst swing bridge carries the A5509 road over the navigation, and was manufactured by A Handyside and Co. Ltd., of Derby and London, in 1899. It is an asymmetric bowstring lattice girder bridge, and its timber-framed weatherboarded control cabin is also listed. This and Town bridge, which is located a little further downstream and is of a similar design, are believed to be the two earliest swing bridges in Britain to be powered by electricity. Both bridges were designed by J. A. Saner, who was the Navigation&#x27;s engineer, and incorporate a sectional pontoon, which is immersed in the river and carries about 80 per cent of the weight of the bridge. Because of the risk of subsidence from the salt workings, the bridges are fitted with screw jacks which allow the deck level to be maintained. Hayhurst bridge was refurbished in 2004 at a cost of £33.5 million. Winnington bridge, the next downstream, was built between 1908 and 1909, to replace the first bridge which was built in 1901. The original design was flawed, and hence the bridge was replaced after only 7 years. A pedestrian walkway was later fitted on the downstream side of the new bridge.

Saltersford locks were built in 1874, using red sandstone and limestone, and replaced a lock built on the Barnton cut between 1832 and 1835. The Pelton turbines which control the gates were built to Stoney&#x27;s patent, and carry plates which indicate that they were manufactured by Hanna, Donald &amp; Wilson of Paisley. Acton swing bridge is a symmetrical bowstring girder swing bridge, which was built in situ between 1931 and 1933, on an island in the centre of the river. It was first swung across the channel on 10 August 1933. J. A. Saner was again the designer. Dutton locks are of a similar design and age to those at Saltersford, and the Pelton turbines were made by Northern Foundry Co. Ltd. of Oldham, who are described as turbine makers on the cast-iron covers. Dutton sluice, some to the north-east of the lock, was built in the 1870s, in a similar Baroque style to Hunt&#x27;s weir, but is larger, with eight arches each carrying a sluice gate. Where the weir stream rejoins the main channel, the towpath is carried over it on Horse Bridge, which was designed by J. A. Saner, the Navigation&#x27;s engineer, in 1915, and erected in 1916. It is one of the earliest surviving laminated timber structures, and consists of two arches, both over long. Below the locks, Joseph Locke and George Stephenson built another viaduct for the Grand Junction Railway, which was completed in 1836 and is grade II* listed. It has 20 arches, and was built at a cost of £54,440 by a London civil engineering contractor called David McIntosh. A civic celebration was held on its completion, as there had been no deaths and no serious injuries to the workers during its construction. The navigation has since been re-routed, and now passes through a different arch of the structure.

The weir at Frodsham was built in 1785, although it has been altered subsequently. The main curved section is wide, and there are two sluices at the southern end. The adjacent lock, which was designed by Robert Pownall and George Leigh in 1781, was modified in 1830 and later, but most traffic was using the Weston cut by the time of the 1890s upgrade, and so it retained some of its original features. It is derelict, and water flow is controlled by a concrete and steel sluice erected in the mid 20th century. A red sandstone and limestone bridge carries the A56 road over the channel below the lock. It was built in 1850, and has three arches. The A56 crosses the main channel on Sutton swing bridge, which was built in the 1920s. There have been problems with the stability of the road surface, and options to secure its long-term future and appearance were discussed in 2010. A £4.5 million restoration project began in the summer of 2013, with the construction of a temporary bridge to carry the traffic while the swing bridge was refurbished. Work included fitting a new deck and renovation of the buoyancy tanks on which the bridge swings. During the project, river access was only possible by narrow boats and other small craft. Frodsham viaduct, completed in 1850 and built in brown bricks with a cast-iron central arch, was built for the Birkenhead, Lancs &amp; Cheshire Junction Railway by the contractor Thomas Brassey. The engineer for the project was Alexander Rendel.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency assesses the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Weaver was as follows in 2019.
Reasons for not achieving good quality include agricultural runoff and the discharge of treated effluent from sewage treatment works along the length of the river. Chemical status was rated good until 2016, but is now rated fail, largely due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, which are used as flame retardants in many products, mercury compounds, and the insecticide cypermethrin, all substances which did not form part of the quality checks prior to 2019.

In August 2012, oxygen levels in the river were found to be low, following the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem. This was thought to result from naturally occurring algae, which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend, and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide, which is used to improve oxygen levels in the water, and traces of detergent. The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous. The Winsford and District Angling Association, who use the river for fishing, believe it will take many years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident.

==Points of interest==







==Tributaries==
The following is a list of those named watercourses which enter the river Weaver on its left (L) or right (R) bank. By convention, the left and right banks are as viewed when looking downstream. Tributaries are listed down the page in an upstream direction, i.e. the first tributary listed (Flood Brook) is closest to the sea (or indeed the river&#x27;s entry into the Manchester Ship Canal), and tributaries of tributaries are treated similarly. Where a named watercourse derives from the confluence of two differently named rivers these are labelled as (Ls) and (Rs) for the left and right forks (the rivers on the left and right, relative to an observer facing downstream).

<doc id="347149" wikidata="Q1527859" url="?curid=347149" title="Law enforcement in the United Kingdom">
<text>Law enforcement in the United Kingdom is organised separately in each of the legal systems of the United Kingdom: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Most law enforcement duties are carried out by police constables of a territorial police force.

As of 2021, there were 39 territorial police forces in England, 4 in Wales, one in Scotland, and one in Northern Ireland. Each is responsible for most law enforcement and crime reduction in its police area. In terms of national government the territorial police forces of England and Wales are overseen by the Home Office, although they are operationally independent from government. The British Transport Police (BTP), the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP), and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) provide specialist policing services in England, Scotland and Wales. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is primarily tasked with tackling organised crime and has been compared to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States.

Police constables have certain powers that enable them to execute their duties. Their primary duties are the protection of life and property, preservation of the peace, and prevention and detection of criminal offences. In the British model of policing, police officers exercise their police powers with the implicit consent of the public. &quot;Policing by consent&quot; is the phrase used to describe this. It expresses that the legitimacy of policing in the eyes of the public is based upon a general consensus of support that follows from transparency about their powers, their integrity in exercising those powers and their accountability for doing so.

Most police constables in England, Scotland and Wales do not carry firearms. As of 2022, there were 142,526 police officers in England and Wales, 6,192 of which were firearms authorised.

==History==

In the 18th century, law enforcement and policing were organised by local communities based on watchmen and constables; the government was not directly involved in policing. The City of Glasgow Police, the first professional police, was established following an Act of Parliament in 1800. The first centrally organised police force in the world was created in Ireland, then a part of the United Kingdom, following the Peace Preservation Act in 1814 for which Sir Robert Peel was largely responsible.

London had a population of nearly one and a half million people in the early 19th century but was policed by only 450 constables and 4,500 night watchmen. The concept of professional policing was taken up by Sir Robert Peel when he became Home Secretary in 1822. Peel&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Act 1829 established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the greater London area known as the Metropolitan Police. In March 1839, Sir Edwin Chadwick presented &quot;The Royal Commission on Constabulary Forces&quot; to Parliament. This report was to evaluate how the burgeoning police force would work with &quot;poor law&quot; as well as to make the case to establish a national force based on the Metropolitan Police. Much of his argument was based around the necessity for protection of the developing capitalism that was growing in England at the time. Chadwick also addressed the concern that building out a powerful police state could lead to a reduction in civil and personal liberties, but argued that the fear of crime made English citizens slaves, and so were less free without aggressive policing. Legislation in the 1830s introduced policing in boroughs and many counties and, in the 1850s, policing was established nationally.

The Peelian principles describe the philosophy that Sir Robert Peel developed to define an ethical police force. The principles traditionally ascribed to Peel state that:
* Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests, but on the lack of crime.
* Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount. Hence, Peel&#x27;s most often quoted principle that &quot;The police are the public and the public are the police.&quot;

Nine principles of policing were set out in the &#x27;General Instructions&#x27; issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police from 1829. The Home Office has suggested this list was more likely to have been authored by Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, the first and joint Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police.

The police historian Charles Reith explained in his &quot;New Study of Police History&quot; (1956) that these principles constituted a philosophy of policing &quot;unique in history and throughout the world because it derived not from fear but almost exclusively from public co-operation with the police, induced by them designedly by behaviour which secures and maintains for them the approval, respect and affection of the public&quot;. This approach to policing became known as &quot;policing by consent&quot;.

Other historians, such as Robert Storch, David Philips and Roger Swift, argue that Peel&#x27;s Metropolitan Police were built on his experience of the Royal Irish Constabulary. Storch&#x27;s view is that the English police force is not different to those of other nations and in fact follows a rather typical development as a colonial peacekeeping force. There is extensive documentation of police brutality in the 19th century, including excessive force, racial profiling, and several charges of murder. The controversies that plagued the early years of the police force were much the same as the current complaints against modern policing.

The first women police officers were employed during the First World War. Hull and Southampton were two of the first to towns to employ women police, although Grantham was the first to have a warranted policewoman.

Since the 1940s, police forces in the United Kingdom have been merged and modernised.

Corruption at the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Flying Squad led to a conviction and resignations in 1977 after the Operation Countryman investigations. A Police Complaints Board was set up to handle allegations of malpractice in response.

Changes took place to tighten police procedures in the 1980s, in response to the Scarman Report, to ensure that evidence and interviews were robust, in the introduction of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. In 1989, the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad was disbanded as a series of around 100 criminal cases failed or were subsequently overturned in the West Midlands, after new forensic techniques showed police officers had been tampering with statement evidence to secure convictions, including those of the Birmingham Six.

The Police Complaints Board was replaced by the Police Complaints Authority in 1985, which itself was superseded by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in 2004. On 8 January 2018, the IPCC was replaced by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

== Powers of officers ==
===Territorial police constables===
Most police officers are members of territorial police forces. A person must make a declaration before taking up office as a constable and having any powers; although this is sometimes still known as the police oath, and the process sometimes referred to as &quot;swearing in&quot;, it now takes the form of an &quot;attestation&quot; (in England and Wales and Northern Ireland) or a &quot;declaration&quot; (in Scotland). The process is carried out in the presence of a magistrate, and is usually followed by the issue of a warrant card. This grants the officer all the powers and privileges, duties and responsibilities of a constable in one of the three distinct legal systems - either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, and the territorial waters of that country. The limited circumstances where their powers extend across the border are described in the section above.
===Other constables===

There are many constables who are not members of territorial police forces. The most notable are members of the three forces referred to as special police forces: the British Transport Police, Ministry of Defence Police and Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Such officers have the &quot;powers and privileges of a constable&quot; in matters relating to their work. BTP and MDP officers have additional jurisdiction where requested by a constable of another force, in which case they take on that constable&#x27;s jurisdiction. Upon request from the chief police officer of a police force, members of one of the above three forces can be given the full powers of constables in the police area of the requesting force. This was used to supplement police numbers in the areas surrounding the 2005 G8 summit at Gleneagles.

Many acts allow companies or councils to employ constables for a specific purpose. There are ten companies whose employees are sworn in as constables under section 79 of the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847. As a result, they have the full powers of a constable on land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land. There are also forces created by specific legislation, such as the Port of Tilbury Police (Port of London Act 1968), Mersey Tunnels Police (County of Merseyside Act 1989) and the Epping Forest Keepers (Epping Forest Act 1878).

====Parks Constables====

Under Article 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967, London Borough Councils are allowed to swear in council officers as constables for &quot;securing the observance of the provisions of all enactments relating to open spaces under their control or management and of bye-laws and regulations made thereunder&quot;. Local Authority Parks Constables have all the powers of a constable in relation byelaws regulations and all enactments relating to open spaces, Article 19 of the Act was repealed by section 26(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Local Acts) and the power of arrest for Parks Constables is now contained in Section 24 of P.A.C.E 1984, further amendments to Article 19 covering coming to the aid and assistance of such a constable or officer were repealed by SOCPA 2005, as this provision is already covered in P.A.C.E 1984 (Legal Counsel 2007,2012).
No enforcement agency with a power of arrest or detention can operate outside of the provisions of P.A.C.E 1984; therefore all local powers of arrest and detention were brought into line under section 26(1) P.A.C.E 1984.

===Police staff===
Police forces employ staff who perform many functions to assist officers and support the smooth running of their police force. They do not hold the office of constable. In England &amp; Wales, the chief police officer of a territorial police force may designate any person who is employed by the police authority maintaining that force, and is under the direction and control of that chief police officer, as one of the following:

*Police community support officer (PCSO)
*Policing support officer.

PCSOs were created by the Police Reform Act 2002, with a range of standard powers, as well as additional powers that can be conferred at the discretion of their chief police officer. Unlike a police constable, a PCSO only has powers when on duty and in uniform, and within the area policed by their respective force.

The policing support officer role was originally as three separate roles in Police Reform Act 2002, each with a specific list of discretionary powers that may be awarded by a chief constable: 
*Investigating officer,
*Detention officer
*Escort officer.
The Policing and Crime Act 2017 reformed this and streamlined it to the two roles above, and gave full discretionary powers to Chief Constables, such that they may assign any powers, other than powers reserved for constables only, to any police staff or volunteer.

Until 1991, parking enforcement was primarily conducted by police-employed traffic wardens. Since the passage of the Road Traffic Act 1991, decriminalised parking enforcement has enabled local authorities to take on this role and now very few forces still employ police traffic wardens. These include the Metropolitan Police Service; however, they have combined the role with PCSOs as &quot;traffic community support officers&quot;.

In Scotland, police custody and security officers have powers similar to those of detention officers and escort officers in England and Wales. Similar powers are available in Northern Ireland.
===Accredited persons===
Chief police officers of territorial police forces (and the British Transport Police) can also give limited powers to people not employed by the police authority, under Community Safety Accreditation Schemes. A notable example are officers of the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, who have been given powers to stop vehicles. This practice has been criticised by the Police Federation who described it as &quot;half-baked&quot;.

===Members of the armed forces===
In Northern Ireland only, members of British Armed Forces have powers to stop people or vehicles, arrest and detain people for three hours and enter buildings to keep the peace or search for people who have been kidnapped. Additionally, commissioned officers may close roads. If necessary, they may use force when exercising these powers as long as it is reasonable.

Under the Customs Management Act 1979, members of the armed forces may detain people if they believe they have committed an offence under the Customs &amp; Excise acts, and may seize goods if they believe they are liable to forfeiture under the same acts.

Service police/military police personnel are not constables under UK law and they do not have any police powers over the general public; however, they have the full range of policing powers that constables possess when dealing with service personnel or civilians subject to service discipline, drawing their powers from the Armed Forces Act 2006. The service police do assist territorial police forces in towns in the UK with nearby military barracks where there are likely to be significant numbers of service personnel off duty. In British Overseas Territories, they are sometimes sworn in as constables to assist and/or act as the police force (e.g. the British Indian Ocean Territory Police which is made up of tri-service police personnel and are known as &quot;Royal Overseas Police Officers&quot;) and anywhere that British Forces are stationed or deployed. Generally, when carrying out this assistance, service policemen/women are unarmed, but have a range of PPE including batons, handcuffs and stab vests. 
===Other persons===

====Sworn persons====
*Prison officers of His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service, the Scottish Prison Service, and the Northern Ireland Prison Service have the powers, authority, protection, and privileges of a constable when acting as such.
*Employees of the National Crime Agency can be granted the powers of a constable, immigration officer or customs officer.
*Border Force and Immigration Enforcement officers hold powers as immigration officers and/or customs officers, with certain powers of arrest, detention and search.
*HM Revenue and Customs staff can hold the powers of a customs officer, with widespread powers in relation to customs offences.
*In England and Wales, Environment Agency fisheries enforcement officers have the powers, authority, protection, and privileges of a constable and powers in relation to enforcement of fishing regulations. Scottish water bailiffs have similar powers.
*Court officers, commonly referred to as &quot;bailiffs&quot; — bailiff in Scotland and enforcement agents in England and Wales — can enforce court orders and, in some cases, have powers of arrest.

====Non-sworn persons====

*In England, Traffic Officers are employed by National Highways to maintain traffic flow on trunk roads. Traffic Officer have powers to direct traffic and place road signs, close lanes of an active motorway, and stop vehicles if they believe them to be unroadworthy for the road and condition they are driving in. 
*Some employees of local authorities have powers of entry relating to inspection of businesses under the Sunday Trading Act 1994 and powers to give Fixed Penalty Notices for offences such as littering, graffiti or one of the wide-ranging offences in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. Such powers may be granted under local bylaws or acts of parliament. The Community Safety Accreditation Scheme also led to the proliferation of accredited neighbourhood warden schemes (and supporting enforcement functions) employed by several local authorities (and sometimes social housing providers) across England and Wales, such as Nottingham City Council&#x27;s Community Protection Officers.
*Natural England and Animal and Plant Health Agency wildlife inspectors have certain powers of entry and inspection to investigate wildlife offences and licenses relating to wildlife.
*Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority officers have powers to enforce bylaws and parts of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.
*Employees of fire and rescue services have extensive powers in the event of an emergency, and more limited powers in other circumstances, such as fire investigations.
*The Ministry of Defence Guard Service (MGS) are an unarmed, civilian, security force that protects Ministry of Defence (MOD) sites and persons. They provide access control, patrols and static guarding.
*The Military Provost Guard Service (MPGS) are part of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps Provost Branch, of the British Army, responsible for maintaining physical and armed security at British Armed Forces locations throughout Great Britain.
*Regimental police of the British Army (properly called Regimental Provost Staff) are non-commissioned officers (NCOs) of a regiment or corps that are responsible for regimental discipline and service law enforcement. They belong to the regiment or corps, in which they enforce discipline, rather than the Royal Military Police or its equivalent. They are not to be confused with service/military police.
*Civilian Security Officers (CSO) of the Northern Ireland Security Guard Service whilst on duty hold similar powers to those of a Police Constable, as allowed by the Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1947. A CSO has the powers of arrest under the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (PACE).
*The Military Provost Staff (MPS) are the British Army&#x27;s prison service and specialists in custody and detention. They operate the Military Corrective Training Centre (MCTC) (Colchester, Essex), and the seven regional service custody facilities around the country.
In the United Kingdom, every person has limited powers of arrest if they see a crime being committed: at common law in Scotland, and in England and Wales if the crime is indictable – these are called &quot;every person powers&quot;, commonly referred to as a &quot;citizen&#x27;s arrest&quot;. In England and Wales, the vast majority of attested constables enjoy full powers of arrest and search as granted by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. For the purposes of this legislation, &quot;constables&quot; is defined to mean all police officers, irrespective of rank. Although police officers have wide-ranging powers, they are still subject to the same laws as members of the public (aside from specific exemptions such as the carrying of firearms and certain road traffic legislation). There are additional legal restrictions placed on police officers such as the prohibitions on industrial action and on taking part in active politics.

== Jurisdictions and territories ==
Every geographic place in the United Kingdom is defined in law as part of certain police area. In England and Wales this is currently defined in section1 of the Police Act 1996. A police area defines the geographic area for which a territorial police force is responsible for policing. This is different to legal jurisdiction (see below). Special police forces (such as the BTP) do not have police areas and ultimately the Chief Constable of a territorial police force is responsible for maintaining law and order throughout his/her police area even if, for example, BTP have a presence at railways stations within the police area. Scotland and Northern Ireland have national police forces (see below).

In England, Police forces are funded by a combination of sources including central government and through the &quot;police precept&quot; tax levied as part of Council Tax which is charged by local governments. The local police force precept can be increased via referendum. Since 2013, police forces in England (and Wales) have been overseen by a directly elected Police and crime commissioner (PCC) who holds the force to account for the public. PCCs do not have operational control of the police force, with operational management of the police force the responsibility of the chief constable in most English police forces, although the equivalent position is referred to as commissioner in the London Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police. Administration of police matters is not generally affected by the Government of Wales Act 2006.

=== Current United Kingdom Territorial Police Forces ===
=== Proposed mergers for England and Wales ===
In 1981 James Anderton, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, called for the number of forces to be reduced to nine in England (one for each Region) and one for Wales. A 2004 proposal by the Police Superintendents&#x27; Association for the creation of a single national police force, similar to Garda Síochána was objected to by the Association of Chief Police Officers. The government did not accept the proposal at the time.

From 2005 to 2006, the government considered merging several territorial police forces in England and Wales. The review only concerned policing in outside of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Greater London. Likewise, the major non-territorial forces (British Transport Police, Civil Nuclear Constabulary, Ministry of Defence Police) are responsible to other government departments, and would not have been affected either. The primary argument for merging forces is that forces with 4,000 or more officers would perform better and could save costs. The view was supported by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, who said in September 2005 that the existing structure was &quot;no longer working&quot;.

Merger proposals were announced by the Home Secretary in early 2006. They proposed reducing the number of police forces to less than 25, with Wales and several Regions of England having one force each. The consultation period on this second batch of mergers started on 11 April 2006, and would have finished on 11 August, with a target of April 2008 for the mergers coming into effect.

On 20 June 2006 the then Home Secretary, John Reid, announced that the contested mergers would be delayed for further discussion. The only merger agreed to was with Lancashire Constabulary and Cumbria Constabulary. On 12 July 2006, the Home Office confirmed that all the mergers were to be abandoned, with the entire proposal taken back for consultation.

=== Wales ===
* Dyfed–Powys Police
* Gwent Police
* North Wales Police
* South Wales Police

=== Scotland ===
In 2013, the 8 territorial police forces in Scotland were merged into a single Scottish police force, named &quot;The Police Service of Scotland&quot;, or colloquially Police Scotland. Merging these forces had been first mooted in 2010, and was supported by the Scottish National Party, Scottish Labour Party and Scottish Conservative Party ahead of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. After a consultation process, the Scottish Government confirmed on 8 September 2011 that a single police service would be created in Scotland. The Scottish Government stated that &quot;reform will safeguard frontline policing in communities by creating designated local senior officers for every council area with a statutory duty to work with councils to shape local services. Establishing a single service aims to ensure more equal access to national and specialist services and expertise such as major investigation teams and firearms teams, whenever and wherever they are needed.&quot; The Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Bill was published in January 2012 and was approved on 27 June 2012 after scrutiny in the Scottish Parliament. The Bill received royal assent as the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012. This created a force of approximately 17,000 police officers, the second largest in the United Kingdom after the Metropolitan Police in London.

In March 2015, following the transfer of police oversight powers to the Scottish Government, the Justice Secretary announced proposals to further unify policing in Scotland by merging the British Transport Police&#x27;s operations north of the border with Police Scotland.

=== Northern Ireland ===
=== Cross-jurisdiction powers ===
Territorial police constables have certain powers of arrest in another one of the UK&#x27;s three legal jurisdictions than they were attested in. There are four main provisions for them to do so – arrest with a warrant, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in their home jurisdiction whilst in another jurisdiction, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in another jurisdiction whilst in that jurisdiction, and mutual aid. A fifth power of cross jurisdictional arrest was introduced by section 116 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 which fills a loop hole in arrest powers in certain situations. This power came into force in March 2018. This new power allows a constable from one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction. This power is in relation to more serious offences as listed in the act. The Act sets out how long the person can be detained in custody by the &#x27;arresting force&#x27; in one jurisdiction until constables from the &#x27;investigating force&#x27; in another jurisdiction can travel to re-arrest the person and deal accordingly. Below is a summary of these five powers with a practical example due to the complicated nature of this area of law. Note: this section applies to territorial police constables only, and not to others – except the British Transport Police, who also have certain cross-border powers in addition to their natural powers.

====Arrest with warrant====
Certain warrants can be executed by constables even though they are outside their jurisdiction: arrest warrants and warrants of committal (all); and a warrant to arrest a witness (England, Wales or Northern Ireland); a warrant for committal, a warrant to imprison (or to apprehend and imprison), and a warrant to arrest a witness (Scotland). A warrant issued in one legal jurisdiction may be executed in either of the other two jurisdictions by a constable from either the jurisdiction where it was issued, or the jurisdiction where it is executed.

When executing a warrant issued in Scotland, the constable executing it shall have the same powers and duties, and the person arrested the same rights, as they would have had if execution had been in Scotland by a constable of a police force in Scotland. When executing a warrant issued in England &amp; Wales or Northern Ireland, a constable may use reasonable force and has specified search powers provided by section 139 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

====Arrest without warrant: offences committed in home jurisdiction====
In very simple terms, this power allows constables of one jurisdiction to travel to another jurisdiction and arrest a person they suspect of committing an offence in their home jurisdiction. For example, constables from Cumbria Police investigating an offence of assault that occurred in their police area could travel over the border into Scotland and arrest the suspect without warrant found in Gretna.

If a constable suspects that a person has committed or attempted to commit an offence in their legal jurisdiction, and that person is now in another jurisdiction, the constable may arrest them in that other jurisdiction.

A constable from England &amp; Wales is subject to the same necessity tests for arrest (as under section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) as they would be in England &amp; Wales, a constable from Scotland may arrest if it would have been lawful to do so in Scotland and a constable from Northern Ireland is subject to the same necessity tests for arrest (as under Article 26 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989.) as they would be in Northern Ireland.

A person arrested under the above powers:

* in Scotland, shall be taken to the nearest convenient designated police station or to a designated police station in a police area in which the offence is being investigated (England &amp; Wales or Northern Ireland),
* in England or Wales, shall be taken to the nearest convenient police station (Scotland) or to a police station within a sheriffdom in which the offence is being investigated (Scotland), to the nearest convenient designated police station (Northern Ireland) or to a designated police station in which the offence is being investigated (Northern Ireland), or
* in Northern Ireland, shall be taken either to the nearest convenient designated police station (England &amp; Wales) or to a designated police station in a police area in which the offence is being investigated (England &amp; Wales) or to the nearest convenient police station (Scotland) or to a police station within a sheriffdom in which the offence is being investigated (Scotland).

====Arrest without warrant: offences committed in other jurisdictions (known as reciprocal powers of arrest)====
In simple terms, this power gives a constable of one jurisdiction whilst in another jurisdiction the same power of arrest as a constable of the jurisdiction they are visiting. As a practical example, if constables from Police Scotland are over the border in Cumbria on enquiries and come across a burglary in progress they can arrest the suspect on suspicion of burglary using the same arrest powers as a constable of England or Wales.

A constable from one legal jurisdiction has, in the other jurisdictions, the same powers of arrest as a constable of that jurisdiction would have.

A constable from England or Wales has:

* in Scotland, the same power of arrest as a constable from Scotland
* in Northern Ireland, the same power of arrest as a constable from Northern Ireland would have under Article 26 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (necessity test).

A constable from Scotland has:

* in England and Wales, the same power of arrest as a constable from England or Wales would have under section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (necessity test).
* in Northern Ireland, the same power of arrest as a constable from Northern Ireland would have under Article 26 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (necessity test).

A constable from Northern Ireland has:

* in Scotland, the same power of arrest as a constable from Scotland
* in England and Wales, the same power of arrest as a constable from England or Wales would have under section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (necessity test).

When a constable arrests a person in England &amp; Wales, the constable is subject to the requirements of section 28 (informing of arrest), section 30 (taking to a designated police station) and section 32 (search on arrest). When a constable arrests a person in Scotland, the arrested person shall have the same rights and the constable the same powers and duties as they would have were the constable a constable of a police force in Scotland. When a constable arrests a person in Northern Ireland, the constable is subject to the requirements of Article 30 (informing of arrest), Article 32 (taking to a designated police station) and Article 34 (search on arrest).

==== Arrest without warrant by a constable in his home jurisdiction for an offence committed in another jurisdiction ====
This power allows a constable of one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction. The Policing and Crime Act 2017 sets out which offences this power of arrest will apply to in each jurisdiction (generally serious offences), and how long the person arrested can be kept in custody, with relevant authorities, by the &quot;arresting force&quot; to allow sufficient time for officers from the &quot;investigating force&quot; in another jurisdiction to travel and re-arrest the detained person for the purposes of their investigation.

This relatively new power came into force in March 2018. Until the introduction of this power, there was an issue whereby a constable in his home jurisdiction could not arrest a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction without a warrant.

====Other situations (including Mutual Aid)====
Police forces often support each other with large-scale operations, such as those that require specialist skills or expertise and those that require policing levels that the host-forces cannot provide. Referred to as mutual aid, constables loaned from one force to another have the powers and privileges of a constable of the host force. Constables from the Metropolitan Police who are on protection duties in Scotland or Northern Ireland have all the powers and privileges of a constable of the host police force. A constable who is taking a person to or from a prison retains all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of his office regardless of his location. Regardless of where they are in the United Kingdom, a constable may arrest under section 41 and may stop and search under section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 on suspicion of terrorism (defined by section 40)

==Accountability==
From 22 November 2012, police authorities outside London were replaced by directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners or Police, Fire and Crime Commissioners. In London, the City of London Police continued to be overseen by City of London Corporation, whilst the Mayor of London has responsibility for the governance of the Metropolitan Police. The mayors of Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire also have responsibility for governance.

In Northern Ireland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland is supervised by the Northern Ireland Policing Board.

In Scotland, Police Scotland is overseen by the Scottish Police Authority.

The British Transport Police and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary had their own police authority established in 2004. These forces operate across the United Kingdom and their responsibility is to the specific activities they were established to police.

=== His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorates of Constabulary ===
The official bodies responsible for the examination and assessment of police forces to ensure their requirements are met as intended are:
*His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS): this organisation is responsible to the Home Office for police forces in England and Wales. It also inspects, by invitation, various UK special police forces and elements of the Service (Military) Police. Since 2004, HMICFRS has also had responsibility for examining HM Revenue and Customs and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Inspection services have been provided on a non-statutory basis for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Since July 2017, it has also become responsible for inspecting Fire &amp; Rescue Services in England.
*His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (commonly known as HMICS): this organisation is responsible to the Scottish Government and examines the Police Service of Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority.

As of June 2022, in addition to the London Metropolitan Police, six police forces are in special measures because they are failing. They are Cleveland, Greater Manchester police, Gloucestershire. Staffordshire and Wiltshire forces. London mayor Sadiq Khan said &quot;(...) after 12 years of massive cuts. We&#x27;ve lost 21,000 experienced officers around the country, many of them in London. Because of City Hall funding we&#x27;ve managed to replace many of them, but clearly, with newer, inexperienced officers.&quot;

== Operations ==
===Ranks===
Throughout the United Kingdom, the rank structure of police forces is identical up to the rank of chief superintendent. At higher ranks, structures are distinct within London where the Metropolitan Police Service and the City of London Police have a series of commander and commissioner ranks as their top ranks whereas other UK police forces have assistants, deputies and a chief constable as their top ranks. All commissioners and chief constables are equal in rank.

Police community support officers (PCSOs) were introduced following the passing of the Police Reform Act 2002, although some have criticised these as for being a cheap alternative to fully trained police officers.

===Uniform and equipment===

Uniforms, the issuing of firearms, type of patrol cars, and other equipment, varies by force.

The custodian helmet which is synonymous with the &quot;bobby on the beat&quot; image is frequently worn by male officers in England and Wales (and formerly in Scotland), while the equivalent for female officers is the &quot;bowler&quot; hat. The flat peaked cap is worn by officers on mobile patrol and higher-ranking officers.

Unlike police in most other developed countries, the vast majority of British police officers do not carry firearms on standard patrol; they carry an ASP baton and CS gas or PAVA spray. Officers are becoming increasingly trained in the use of and equipped with the TASER X2 as another tactical option.

==== Firearms ====

Every territorial force has a specialist Firearms Unit, which maintains armed response vehicles to respond to firearms-related emergency calls. The Police Service of Northern Ireland, Belfast International Airport Constabulary, Belfast Harbour Police, Civil Nuclear Constabulary and the Ministry of Defence Police are routinely armed.

London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police firearms unit is the Specialist Firearms Command (SCO19), but every force in the United Kingdom maintains its own armed unit. Metropolitan and City of London Police operate with three officers per armed response vehicle, composed of a driver, a navigator, and an observer who gathers information about the incident and liaises with other units. Other police forces carry two authorised firearms officers instead of three.

Armed police carry various weapons, ranging from semi-automatic carbines to sniper rifles, baton guns (which fire baton rounds) and shotguns. All officers also carry a sidearm. Since 2009, Tasers have been issued to armed officers as an alternative to deadly force.

==== Vehicles ====
The majority of officers on mobile patrol will do so in a marked police vehicle, namely an Incident Response Vehicle (IRV). Officers typically hold a &#x27;response&#x27; permit, allowing them to utilise blue lights and sirens to make an emergency response. Some officers may not have undergone the additional training, and as such are only permitted to use emergency equipment when positioned at a scene or to pull over a vehicle. Officers who have undergone additional training to reach &#x27;initial pursuit phase&#x27; standard are allowed to pursue vehicles, should they fail to stop. Vans are used as IRVs and, more specifically, to transport arrested suspects in a cage, who are unsuitable to be taken to custody in a car.

Some forces utilise Area Cars in addition to IRVs. Like IRVs, they respond to 999 calls and are manned by officers from response teams. However, officers are trained as &#x27;advanced&#x27; drivers – allowing them to drive high-performance vehicles and pursue fleeing vehicles in the tactical phase of a pursuit. Some drivers may also be trained in skills like Tactical Pursuit and Containment (TPAC).

In addition, forces&#x27; specialist units utilise a wide variety of vehicles to help perform their role effectively. Roads Policing Units (RPU) utilise performance vehicles to primarily enforce traffic laws and pursue fleeing suspects. Armed Response Vehicles (ARV) are used to transport armed officers and carry weaponry. Tactical/operational support units use larger vans, equipped with windscreen cages and/or reinforced glass, to transport officers into public order situations.

Forces also utilise unmarked vehicles for a wide-variety of roles. Covert surveillance vehicles are typically not fitted with any emergency equipment, as it is not necessary. Some forces utilise unmarked response vehicles to aid in proactive work. Similarly, some roads policing vehicles and ARVs are unmarked to help officers identity offences and use pre-emptive tactics to stop a suspect fleeing. Additionally, some forces have dedicated road crime units who use high-performance vehicles to primarily focus on organised criminals using the road committing offences.

===Initial training===

====England and Wales====

The College of Policing defines six curricula for new police constables, special constables and police community support officers:
*Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship (PCDA), Degree Holder Entry Programme (DHEP) or a pre-join Policing degree course for police constables
*Initial Learning for the Special Constabulary (IL4SC) for special constables
*PCSO National Learning Programme for police community support officers
A number of alternative programmes exist to join police forces, including Police Now and Fast Track programmes to the rank of Inspector and Superintendent for those with substantial management experience in other sectors.

=====Initial Learning for the Special Constabulary=====
Derived from the IPLDP and although not linked to a formal qualification as such; IL4SC requires the learning outcomes and National Occupational Standards (NOSs) are met in order to become compliant. This curriculum will bring an officer to the &#x27;point of safe and lawful accompanied patrol&#x27;. This course equates to roughly 3.5 weeks of direct learning.

=====PCSO National Learning Programme=====
Successfully completion of the PCSO NLP over a period of six months to a year will result in a non-mandatory Certificate in Policing and this equates to 10 weeks of direct learning and consists of six mandatory units. Four of these units also feature within the IPLDP and being a QCF qualification, this can allow for officers wishing to become police officers for &#x27;Recognition of Prior Learning&#x27; (RPL) and the transfer of such units to the IPLDP scheme.

====Scotland====

All initial probationer training in Scotland is undertaken at the Scottish Police College (or SPC) at Tulliallan Castle. Recruits initially spend 12 weeks at the SPC before being posted to their divisions and over the next two years return to the SPC a number of times to complete examinations and fitness tests. Training is composed of four distinct modules undertaken at various locations with some parts being delivered locally and some centrally at the SPC.

Training for Special Constables is delivered locally at seven locations throughout Scotland over a series of evenings and/or weekends. The training is split into two parts, with the first phase being delivered in a classroom environment before being sworn in as a Special Constable and the second phase is delivered after being sworn in. Upon successful completion of both parts of the training programme Special Constables are awarded a certificate of achievement and would be eligible to complete an abbreviated course at the Scottish Police College should they later wish to join the Police Service of Scotland as a regular officer.

===Organisation of police forces===
As all police forces are autonomous organisations there is much variation in organisation and nomenclature; however, outlined below are the main strands of policing that makes up police forces:

* All police forces have teams of officers who are responsible for general beat duties and response to emergency and non-emergency calls from the public. These officers are generally the most visible and will invariably be the first interface a member of the public has with police. In general terms these officers will normally patrol by vehicle (though also on foot or bicycle in urban areas). They will generally patrol a sub-division or whole division of a police force area or in the case of the Metropolitan Police Service, a borough. Nearly all police officers begin their careers in this area of policing, with some moving on to more specialist roles. The Metropolitan Police Service calls this area of policing &#x27;Response Teams&#x27;, whilst other forces use terms such as &#x27;patrol&#x27;, &#x27;section&#x27; and other variations.
* Most local areas or wards in the country have at least one police officer who is involved in trying to build links with the local community and resolve long-term problems. In London, the Metropolitan Police Service addresses this area of policing with Safer Neighbourhood Teams. This entails each political ward in London having a Police Sergeant, two police constables and a few PCSOs who are ring fenced to address problems and build community links in their respective wards. Other police forces have similar systems but can be named &#x27;Area officers&#x27;, &#x27;Neighbourhood officers&#x27;, &#x27;Beat Constables&#x27; and a number of other variations.
* Criminal Investigation Departments (CID) can be found in all police forces. Generally these officers deal with investigations of a more complex, serious nature; however, this again can differ from force to force. Most officers within this area are detectives. Depending on the force in question this area of policing can be further divided into a myriad of other specialist areas such as fraud. Smaller forces tend to have detectives who deal with a wide range of varied investigations whereas detectives in larger forces can have a very specialist remit.
* All police forces have specialist departments that deal with certain aspects of policing. Larger forces such as Greater Manchester Police, Strathclyde Police and West Midlands Police have many and varied departments and units such as traffic, firearms, marine, horse, tactical support all named differently depending on the force. Smaller forces such Dyfed Powys Police and Warwickshire Police will have fewer specialists and will rely on cross training, such as firearms officers also being traffic trained officers. The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the country, has a large number of specialist departments, some of which are unique to the Metropolitan Police due to policing the capital and its national responsibilities. For example, the Diplomatic Protection Group and Counter Terrorism Command.

====Fixated Threat Assessment Centre====

In the United Kingdom, the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre is a joint police/mental health unit set up in October 2006 by the Home Office, the Department of Health and Metropolitan Police Service to identify and address those individuals considered to pose a threat to VIPs or the Royal Family.
 They may then be referred to local health services for further assessment and potential involuntary commitment. In some cases, they may be detained by police under the section 136 powers of the Mental Health Act 1983 prior to referral.

====Border Force====
As part of the wide-ranging review of the Home Office, the then Home Secretary, John Reid, announced in July 2006 that all British immigration officers would be uniformed. On 1 April 2007 the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) was created and commenced operation. However, there were no police officers in the Agency, a matter that attracted considerable criticism when the Agency was established: agency officers have limited powers of arrest. Further powers for designated officers within the Agency, including powers of detention pending the arrival of a police officer, were introduced by the UK Borders Act 2007.

The Government effectively admitted the shortcomings of the Agency by making a number of fundamental changes within a year of its commencement. On 1 April 2008 the BIA became the UK Border Agency following a merger with UKvisas, the port of entry functions of HM Revenue and Customs. The Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, announced that the UK Border Agency (UKBA) &quot;...will bring together the work of the Border and Immigration Agency, UK Visas and parts of HM Revenue and Customs at the border, &quot; [and] &quot;will work closely with the police and other law enforcement agencies to improve border controls and security.&quot;

Within months of this, the Home Secretary revealed (in a 16-page response to a report by Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of UK terrorism legislation) that the Home Office would issue a Green Paper proposing to take forward proposals by the Association of Chief Police Officers (England &amp; Wales) for the establishment of a new 3,000-strong national border police force to work alongside the Agency.

Following a major enquiry into the UK Border Agency that exposed significant flaws in the operation of border controls, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, announced in 2012 that the Border Force, which is responsible for manning all points of entry into the United Kingdom, would be split from the control of the UKBA and become a separate organisation with direct accountability to ministers and a &quot;law-enforcement ethos&quot;. Brian Moore, the former Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police, was appointed as the first head of the new UKBF.

====Overseas police forces in the UK====
There are certain instances where police forces of other nations operate in a limited degree in the United Kingdom:
*The &#x27;Police aux Frontières&#x27; or PAF (French Border Police), a division of the &quot;Police Nationale&quot;, is permitted to operate in regard to Eurostar rail services through the Channel Tunnel. This includes on Eurostar trains to London, within the international terminal at St Pancras station, at and railway stations, and at the Cheriton Parc Le Shuttle terminal (alongside French Customs officials). The PAF also operates at Dover Ferry terminals. This arrangement is reciprocated to the British Transport Police, UK Border Force, and UK Customs Officers on Paris-bound trains and within the terminal at Paris Gare du Nord, Coquelles (Le Shuttle), Gare de Lille-Europe, Bruxelles-Midi/Brussel-Zuid and the Calais, Dunkerque, and Boulogne ferry terminals. The French police officers, who carry firearms while on duty in France, are not permitted to carry their firearms in the London Terminal; the firearms must be left on the train.
* (Irish Police), under an agreement between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, has the right, alongside the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, to carry out inspections of the Sellafield nuclear facility in Cumbria.
*In 2006 a small number of officers from the Policja (Polish Police) were seconded to the North Wales Police to assist with the supervision of foreign (largely eastern European) truck traffic largely on European route E22 (the A55 road). The Chief Constable of North Wales has publicly stated (November 2006) that he is considering directly recruiting a small number of officers from Poland to assist with policing the substantial population of Polish people that have migrated to his area since Poland&#x27;s accession to the EU in 2004.
*Military Police of forces present in the UK within the terms of the Visiting Forces Act 1952 are permitted to travel to/from relevant premises in uniform and their (usually distinctive) vehicles will occasionally be seen. Their powers (including the carrying of firearms) are generally limited by that and other legislation to those necessary for the performance of duties related to their own forces and to those possessed by the general public.

====Overseas secondments====
UK police officers have often served overseas as part of secondments to United Nations Police (UNPOL), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and European Union Police (EUPOL). These are typically training and mentoring posts, but sometimes involve carrying out executive policing duties.

=====Greater London=====

One of the most common merger proposals is to merge the City of London Police and London operations of the British Transport Police into the Metropolitan Police.

The 2005–06 merger proposals had not included Greater London. This was due to two separate reviews of policing in the capital. The first was a review by the Department of Transport into the future role and function of the British Transport Police. The second was a review by the Attorney-General into national measures for combating fraud (the City of London Police is one of the major organisations for combating economic crime). Both the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, and the Mayor, Ken Livingstone, stated that they would like to see a single police force in London, with the Metropolitan Police also absorbing the functions of the British Transport Police in London. However, the proposal to merge both the BTP and City forces with the Met drew significant criticism from several areas: the House of Commons Transport Select Committee severely criticised the idea of the Metropolitan Police taking over policing of the rail network in a report published on 16 May 2006, while the City of London Corporation and several major financial institutions in the City made public their opposition to the City Police merging with the Met. In a statement on 20 July 2006, the Transport Secretary announced that there would be no structural or operational changes to the British Transport Police, effectively ruling out any merger The interim report by the Attorney General&#x27;s fraud review recognised the role taken by the City Police as the lead force in London and the South-East for tackling fraud, and made a recommendation that, should a national lead force be required, the City Police, with its expertise, would be an ideal candidate to take this role. This view was confirmed on the publication of the final report, which recommended that the City of London Police&#x27;s Fraud Squad should be the national lead force in combatting fraud, to &quot;act as a centre of excellence, disseminate best practice, give advice on complex inquiries in other regions, and assist with or direct the most complex of such investigations&quot;.

Separate from the proposals raised by the Mayor of London and Metropolitan Police Commissioner was a plan by the government to reform policing in the Royal Parks. Since 1872 this had been the responsibility of the Royal Parks Constabulary. A report by former Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Anthony Speed provided three options to reform the RPC, and it was decided that it should be merged with the Metropolitan Police. The Met took over responsibility for policing the Royal Parks on 1 April 2004 with the formation of the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit. The full merger and abolition of the Royal Parks Constabulary took place in May 2006.

In May 2016, following his election, the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan ordered a review, led by Lord Harris, of London&#x27;s preparedness in the face of potential terror attacks. Amongst the recommendations, which were published in October 2016, was a revisiting of the idea of merging the Metropolitan Police, City of London Police and British Transport Police. In commenting, both the City Police and BTP cautioned against the proposal.

=== Funding ===

The police are funded both by central government and by local government. Central government funding is calculated based by a formula, based on several population and socio-economic factors which are used to determine the expected cost of policing the area.

For the 2017/18 fiscal year, the budget for local Police and Crime Commissioners to spend on police is £11 billion, with an extra £1.5 billion allocated to counter-terrorism and other special programmes. The combined funding will reduce from £12.3 billion in 2017/18 to £11.6 billion in 2020/21. His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) estimates that officer numbers will fall by around 2%.

According to the National Audit Office, funding was decreased between 2011 and 2016 by 22% in real terms and police officer numbers fell by 20,000 from 2010 to 2017. Funding levels stayed the same in real terms between 2015 and 2018, with a decrease in central government funding made up for by an increase in local government funding. Increased spending in some areas such as counter-terrorism has been offset by decreased spending in other departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc2/3/2017&quot;&gt;Police &#x27;rationing&#x27; puts public at risk, warns watchdog &quot;BBC&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 further funding cuts will force further cuts in the numbers of police officers. 80% of UK people believe Britain is less safe due to cuts to police funding.

In 2017, a report from the Inspectorate found that most police forces were providing a good service, though it noted that some aspects such as investigations and neighbourhood policing were being compromised by &quot;rationing&quot; and cutbacks. A report from the Inspectorate in March 2018 had similar findings; it reported improvement in neighbourhood policing and highlighted issues with response policing. Several current and former chief constables were raising concerns about whether the police can meet foreseeable challenges with current levels of funding.

==Issues==
===Deaths after contact with the police===
The police service is sometimes criticised for incidents that result in deaths due to police firearms usage or in police custody, as well as the lack of competence and impartiality in investigations &quot;(in England and Wales only)&quot; by the Independent Police Complaints Commission after these events. &quot;The Economist&quot; stated in 2009:


====Controversial shootings====

The policy under which police officers in England and Wales use firearms has resulted in controversy. Notorious examples include the Stephen Waldorf shooting in 1983, the deliberate fatal shootings of James Ashley in 1998, Harry Stanley in 1999, and Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005, and the accidental non-fatal shooting of Abdul Kahar in 2006.

====Deaths in police custody====

From 1990 to July 2012, 950 deaths occurred in police custody.

In 1997/98, 69 people died in police custody or following contact with the police across England and Wales; 26 resulted from deliberate self-harm.

There are two defined categories of death in custody issued by the Home Office:

Category A: This category also encompasses deaths of those under arrest who are held in temporary police accommodation or have been taken to hospital following arrest. It also includes those who die, following arrest, whilst in a police vehicle.

* they have been taken to a police station after being arrested for an offence, or
* they are arrested at a police station after attending voluntarily at the station or accompanying a constable to it, and is detained there or is detained elsewhere in the charge of a constable, except that a person who is at a court after being charged is not in police detention for those purposes.

Category B: Where the deceased was otherwise in the hands of the police or death resulted from the actions of a police officer in the purported execution of his duty.

* when suspects are being interviewed by the police but have not been detained;
* when persons are actively attempting to evade arrest;
* when persons are stopped and searched or questioned by the police; and
* when persons are in police vehicles (other than whilst in police detention).

Hundreds of people kill themselves within 48 hours of being released from police custody.

===Corruption===
===Civil unrest and misconduct===
*The coal miners&#x27; strike (1984–1985) saw thousands of police from various forces deployed to maintain public order and to prevent intimidation of those continuing to work during a national strike by miners, frequently resulting in violent confrontation.
*The Channel 4 Dispatches 2006 documentary &quot;Undercover Copper&quot; showed police officers watching pornography while on duty, raising questions of standards within UK police forces.

===Racism===
The Macpherson Report coined the phrase &quot;institutionalised racism&quot; to describe policies and procedures that adversely affect persons from ethnic minority groups after the death of Stephen Lawrence.

In 2003, ten police officers from Greater Manchester Police, North Wales Police and Cheshire Constabulary were forced to resign after a BBC documentary, &quot;The Secret Policeman&quot;, shown on 21 October, alleged racism among recruits at Bruche Police National Training Centre at Warrington. In March 2005 it was reported that minor disciplinary action would be taken against twelve other officers in connection with the programme, but that they would not lose their jobs. In November 2003, allegations were made that some police officers were members of the British National Party.

In June 2015, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said there was &quot;some justification&quot; in claims that the Metropolitan Police Service is &quot;institutionally racist&quot;:

The question of institutional racism arose again as a topic of controversy during the Covid-19 pandemic. The stop and search rate for all demographics rose, but increased more for certain ethnic (and age) groups. In the first lockdown, the rate of stop and search for Black and Asian people (and individuals aged 18-24) rose by 109% or more, for white people it rose by 89%. Before the pandemic, stop and search was already controversial due to disproportionate applications of it. Further, the style of stop and search used was reported to be cynical and unfair, with numerous incidences of officers using erroneous reasons to conduct a stop. Disproportionality was also noted in the deployment of Fixed Penalty Notices. Additionally, during the pandemic, the Metropolitan Police experienced controversy due to the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, by then serving Metropolitan Police Officer, Wayne Couzens. This led to a report on practices and culture within the Metropolitan Police by Baroness Louise Casey, who concluded that the Metropolitan Police were institutionally racist. The Angiolini Inquiry into Wayne Couzens also discovered racist messages he had sent to other police officers via WhatsApp.

===Privacy===
At the beginning of 2005 it was announced that the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) had signed an eight-year £122 m contract to introduce biometric identification technology. PITO are also planning to use CCTV facial recognition systems to identify known suspects; a future link to the proposed National Identity Register has been suggested by some.

===Freedom of speech===
The police have sometimes been accused of infringing on free speech. In December 2005, author Lynette Burrows was interviewed by police after expressing her opinion on BBC Radio 5 Live that homosexuals should not be allowed to adopt children. The following month, Sir Iqbal Sacranie was investigated by police for stating the Islamic view that homosexuality is a sin.

===Photography of police===

Section 76 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 came into force on 15 February 2009 making it an offence to elicit, attempt to elicit, or publish information &quot;...of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism&quot; about: a member of His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces; a constable, the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service, or Government Communications Headquarters. Any person found guilty faces 10 years imprisonment and an unlimited fine. It is a defence for a person charged with this offence to prove that they had a reasonable excuse for their action. It is not otherwise illegal to photograph or film a police officer in a public place per se. Any film or photography recorded whilst a constable is dealing with an incident may be seized as it becomes evidence under section 19 of PACE 1984.

===Policing of public protests===
Public order policing presents challenges to the approach of policing by consent. In April 2009, a total of 145 complaints were made following clashes between police and protesters at the G20 summit. Incidents including the death of 47-year-old Ian Tomlinson, minutes after an alleged assault by a police officer, and a separate alleged assault on a woman by a police officer, has led to criticism of police tactics during protests. In response, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson asked Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC) to review policing tactics, including the practice of kettling. These events sparked a debate in the UK about the relationship between the police, media and public, and the independence of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. In response to the concerns, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Denis O&#x27;Connor, published a 150-page report in November 2009 that aimed to restore Britain&#x27;s consent-based model of policing.

=== Police undercover conduct ===
During 2010 and 2011, it emerged that, while engaged in covert infiltration of protest groups, undercover police officers had entered into intimate relationships with a number of people on false pretences and under assumed aliases, in some cases sharing a home, making plans for weddings, or fathering children, only to vanish after some years when their role was complete. In 2015 a public inquiry under a senior judge was announced. In November 2015 the Metropolitan Police published an unreserved apology in which it exonerated and apologised to those women who had been deceived and stated the methodology had constituted abuse and a &quot;gross violation&quot; with severely harmful effects, as part of a settlement of their cases. In 2016 new cases continued to come to light.

===Capacity to solve crimes===
Recorded crime rose by almost a third in the three years to 2018, but charges or summons dropped by 26%, and arrests also fell. Neighbourhood policing capacity has fallen on average by at least a fifth since 2010. Neighbourhood policing is important in dealing with terrorism and gang crime, especially in communities where the police are distrusted. Yvette Cooper said the police were &quot;performing a remarkable public service in increasingly difficult circumstances&quot;, though they were &quot;badly overstretched&quot; and responding with difficulty to increasing challenges like online fraud and online child abuse. Only a very small proportion of online fraud cases are investigated and the police are &quot;woefully under-resourced&quot; for the number of online child sexual abuse investigations they must undertake. Che Donald of the Police Federation of England and Wales said the government should acknowledge the &quot;true cost of policing&quot; or officers would be unable to keep the public safe.

===Police sex abuse allegations===
In 2016, allegations of serious sexual abuse were made against hundreds of police officers in England and Wales. Several forces in England and Wales received 436 allegations of abuse of power for sexual gain against 436 police officers, including 20 police community support officers and eight staff in the two years to March 2016. Mike Cunningham, inspector of constabulary and former chief constable of Staffordshire police said: &quot;It&#x27;s the most serious form of corruption. It is an exploitation of power where the guardian becomes an abuser. What can be worse than a guardian abusing the trust and confidence of an abused person? There can be no greater violation of public trust&quot;.

===Brexit===
Prior to Brexit there were concerns that the UK may lose access to important cross border databases of criminals, which would make it harder for the police to keep the public safe. Police leaders warned of &quot;a significant loss of operational capacity&quot; if the UK were to leave the EU without an agreement on policing. The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners sent a letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid stressing the need for co-operation with European policing and justice organisations after March 2019. The letter stated that 32 measures were used daily including the European Arrest Warrant, the Schengen Information System (SIS) – a database giving alerts about individuals – and the European Criminal Records Information System. The letter stressed the importance and mutual benefit of continued cooperation between the UK and Europe to face mutual threats

The loss of access to SIS has led to police officers being unable to see alerts on criminals from EU countries, and vice versa. UK police agencies have replaced these with Interpol, but this comes with additional administrative overhead and reduced powers, and they are unable to know if they are missing any entries that are in SIS but not Interpol systems. The loss of access to European Investigation Orders has been especially damaging. However, the UK has retained access to DNA, fingerprint, vehicle and flight data.

=== Allegations of &#x27;two-tier policing&#x27; ===
During the 2024 United Kingdom riots, MP and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage accused the police services of two-tier policing after suggesting the riots have been dealt with more harshly than other recent protests. This allegation was later refuted by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Conservative former Home Secretary Priti Patel called Farage&#x27;s comments deeply misleading and &quot;simply not relevant right now&quot;. She told Times Radio: &quot;There&#x27;s a clear difference between effectively blocking streets or roads being closed to burning down libraries, hotels, food banks and attacking places of worship. What we have seen is thuggery, violence, racism.&quot;

When asked by a Sky News journalist whether the Metropolitan Police would &quot;end two-tier policing&quot;, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley responded by grabbing the journalist’s microphone and throwing it to the ground.

A YouGov poll of 2070 people conducted over 7-8 August 2024 found partisan differences in beliefs in police bias, with voters of Reform UK and the Conservative Party more likely to believe that the police were more lenient towards Muslims, black people, the far left and climate activists. Labour and Liberal Democrat voters were more likely to disagree with this, and more likely to believe the police were more strict with black people.

Mike Neville, a retired Scotland Yard detective chief inspector described the 2024 Notting Hill Carnival, a celebration of Afro-Caribbean culture, as the &quot;ultimate example of two-tier policing&quot;, and that if the same disorderly behaviour was replicated at football matches or elsewhere it would be banned. Scotland Yard rejected accusations of two-tier policing at the event. Commander Charmain Brenyah told the Telegraph that officers &quot;make arrests whenever necessary&quot;.

After an incident at Manchester Airport in July 2024 in which a police officer was suspended from duty and four men were arrested, Farage accused Greater Manchester Police and the Crown Prosecution Service of two-tier policing for not announcing charges by October. The Home Office refuted these claims, saying it is &quot;right the CPS and the IOPC were able to carry out their investigations independently&quot;.

== Overseas British Territories and Crown Dependencies Police Forces ==
The Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories have their own police forces, the majority of which use the British model. Because they are not part of the United Kingdom, they are not answerable to the British Government; instead they are organised by and are responsible to their own governments (an exception to this is the Sovereign Base Areas Police; as the SBAs&#x27; existence is solely for the benefit of the British armed forces and do not have full overseas territory status, the SBA Police are responsible to the Ministry of Defence). Because they are based on the British model of policing, these police forces conform to the standards set out by the British government, which includes voluntarily submitting themselves to inspection by the HMIC. Their vehicles share similarities with the vehicles owned by forces based in the UK, such as the use of Battenburg markings.

<text>The bullroarer, rhombus, or turndun, is an ancient ritual musical instrument and a device historically used for communicating over great distances. It consists of a piece of wood attached to a string, which when swung in a large circle produces a roaring vibration sound. 

It dates to the Paleolithic period, examples dating from 18,000 BC having been found in Ukraine. Anthropologist Michael Boyd, a bullroarer expert, documents a number found in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australia. In Ancient Greece it was a sacred instrument used in the Dionysian Mysteries and is still used in rituals worldwide. It was a prominent musical technology among the Australian Aboriginal people, used in ceremonies and to communicate with different people groups across the continent. 

Many different cultures believe that the sounds they make have the power to ward off evil influences.

==Design, use, and sound==
A bullroarer consists of a weighted airfoil (a rectangular thin slat of wood about long and about wide) attached to a long cord. Typically, the wood slat is trimmed down to a sharp edge and serrations along the length of the wooden slat may or may not be used, depending on the cultural traditions of the region in question.

The cord is given a slight initial twist, and the roarer is then swung in a large circle in a horizontal plane, or in a smaller circle in a vertical plane. The aerodynamics of the roarer will keep it spinning about its axis even after the initial twist has unwound. The cord winds fully first in one direction and then the other, alternating.

It makes a characteristic roaring vibrato sound with notable sound modulations occurring from the rotation of the roarer along its longitudinal axis, and the choice of whether a shorter or longer length of cord is used to spin the bullroarer. By modifying the expansiveness of its circuit and the speed given it, and by changing the plane in which the bullroarer is whirled from horizontal to vertical or vice versa, the modulation of the sound produced can be controlled, making the coding of information possible.

The low-frequency component of the sound travels extremely long distances, clearly audible over many miles on a quiet night.

==In culture==
Various cultures have used bullroarers as musical, ritual, and religious instruments and long-range communication devices for at least 19,000 years.
This instrument has been used by numerous early and traditional cultures in both the northern and southern hemispheres but in the popular consciousness it is perhaps best known for its use by Australian Aborigines (it is from one of their languages that the name &quot;turndun&quot; comes).

Henry Cowell composed a composition for two violins, viola, two celli, and two bullroarers. A bullroarer featured in the Kate Bush &quot;Before The Dawn&quot; concerts in London 2014.

===Australian Aboriginal culture===
Bullroarers have been used in initiation ceremonies and in burials to ward off evil spirits, and for bad tidings. Bullroarers are considered secret men&#x27;s business by all or almost all Aboriginal tribal groups, and hence forbidden for women, children, non-initiated men, or outsiders to even hear. Fison and Howitt documented this in &quot;Kamilaroi and Kurnai&quot; (page 198). Anyone caught breaching the imposed secrecy was to be punished by death.

They are used in men&#x27;s initiation ceremonies, and the sound they produce is considered in some indigenous cultures to represent the sound of the Rainbow Serpent. In the cultures of southeastern Australia, the sound of the bullroarer is the voice of Daramulan, and a successful bullroarer can be made only if it has been cut from a tree containing his spirit.

The bullroarer can also be used as a tool in Aboriginal art.

Bullroarers have sometimes been referred to as &quot;wife-callers&quot; by Indigenous Australians.

A bullroarer is used by Paul Hogan in the 1988 film &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot;. John Antill included one in the orchestration of his ballet &quot;Corroboree&quot; (1946). See: Corroboree.

An Australian band Midnight Oil included a recording of an imitation bullroarer on their album &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; (1987) at the beginning of the song &quot;Bullroarer&quot;. In an interview, the band&#x27;s drummer Rob Hirst stated &quot;it&#x27;s a sacred instrument... only initiated men are supposed to hear those sounds. So we didn&#x27;t use a real bullroarer as that would have been cultural imperialism. Instead we used an imitation bullroarer that school kids in Australia use. It is a ruler with a piece of rope wrapped around it.&quot;

===Ancient Greece===

In Ancient Greece, bullroarers were especially used in the ceremonies of the cult of Cybele. A bullroarer was known as a &quot;rhombos&quot; (literally meaning &quot;whirling&quot; or &quot;rumbling&quot;), both to describe its sonic character and its typical shape, the rhombus. (&quot;Rhombos&quot; also sometimes referred to the rhoptron, a buzzing drum).

===Great Britain and Ireland===
In Great Britain and Ireland, the bullroarer—under a number of different names and styles—is used chiefly for amusement, although formerly it may have been used for ceremonial purposes. In parts of Scotland it was known as a &quot;thunder-spell&quot; and was thought to protect against being struck by lightning. In the Elizabeth Goudge novel &quot;Gentian Hill&quot; (1949), set in Devon in the early 19th century, a bullroarer figures as a toy cherished by Sol, an elderly farm labourer, who uses it occasionally to express strong emotion; however, the sound it makes is perceived as being both eerie and unlucky by two other characters, who have an uneasy sense that ominous spirits of the air (&quot;Them&quot;) are being invoked by its whirring whistle.

===Scandinavia===

Scandinavian Stone Age cultures used the bullroarer. In 1991, the archeologists Hein B. Bjerck and Martinius Hauglid found a 6.4 cm-long piece of slate that turned out to be a 5000-year-old bullroarer (called a &quot;brummer&quot; in Scandinavia). It was found in Tuv in northern Norway, a place that was inhabited in the Stone Age.

===Mali===
The Dogon use bullroarers to announce the beginning of ceremonies conducted during the &quot;Sigui&quot; festival held every sixty years over a seven-year period. The sound has been identified as the voice of an ancestor from whom all Dogon are descended.

===Māori culture (New Zealand)===
The pūrerehua is a traditional Māori bullroarer. Its name comes from the Māori word for moth. Made from wood, stone or bone and attached to a long string, the instruments were traditionally used for healing or making rain.

===Native North American===
Almost all the native tribes in North America used bullroarers in religious and healing ceremonies and as toys. There are many styles.

North Alaskan Inupiat bullroarers are known as &quot;imigluktaaq&quot; or &quot;imigluktaun&quot; and described as toy noise maker of bone or wood and braided sinew (wolf-scare).

Banks Island Eskimos were still using Bullroarers in 1963, when a 59 year old woman named Susie scared off four polar bears armed only with three seal hooks acting as such accompanied by vocals. Aleut, Eskimo and Inuit used bullroarers occasionally as a children&#x27;s toy or musical instruments, but preferred drums and rattles.

====Pomo====
The inland Pomo tribes of California used bullroarers as a central part of the &quot;xalimatoto&quot; or Thunder ceremony. Four male tribe members, accompanied by a drummer, would spin bullroarers made from cottonwood, imitating the sound of a thunder storm.

===Native South American===
Shamans of the Amazon basin, for example in Tupi, Kamayurá and Bororo culture used bullroarers as musical instrument for rituals. In Tupian languages, the bullroarer is known as &quot;hori hori.&quot;

<text>The People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (, abbr. MPLA), from 1977–1990 called the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola – Labour Party (), is an Angolan social democratic political party. The MPLA fought against the Portuguese Army in the Angolan War of Independence from 1961 to 1974, and defeated the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) in the Angolan Civil War. The party has ruled Angola since the country&#x27;s independence from Portugal in 1975, being the &quot;de facto&quot; government throughout the civil war and continuing to rule afterwards.

==Formation==
On 10 December 1956, in Estado Novo-ruled Portuguese Angola, the underground Angolan Communist Party (PCA) merged with the Party of the United Struggle for Africans in Angola (PLUAA) to form the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola, with Viriato da Cruz, the president of the PCA, as secretary general. Other groups later merged into MPLA, such as the Movement for the National Independence of Angola (MINA) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Angola (FDLA).

The MPLA&#x27;s core base includes the Ambundu ethnic group and the educated intelligentsia of the capital city, Luanda. The party formerly had links to European and Soviet communist parties, but today is a full-member of the Socialist International grouping of social democratic parties. The armed wing of MPLA was the People&#x27;s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA). The FAPLA later (1975–1991) became the national armed forces of the country when the MPLA took control of the government.

In 1961, the MPLA joined the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), its fraternal party in Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde, in direct combat against the Portuguese empire in Africa. The following year, the expanded umbrella group Conference of Nationalist Organizations of the Portuguese Colonies (CONCP) replaced FRAIN, adding FRELIMO of Mozambique and the CLSTP, forerunner of the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP).

In the early 1970s, the MPLA&#x27;s guerrilla activities were reduced, due to the fierce counter-insurgency campaigns of the Portuguese military. At the same time, internal conflicts caused the movement to temporarily split into three factions (Ala Presidencialista or Presidentialist Wing, Revolta Activa or Active Revolt, and Revolta do Leste or Eastern Revolt). By 1974/75, this situation had been overcome with renewed cooperation, but it scarred the party.

==Independence and civil war==
The Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, Portugal in 1974 established a military government. It promptly ceased anti-independence fighting in Angola and agreed to transfer power to a coalition of three pro-independence Angolan movements. 

The coalition quickly broke down and the newly independent Angola broke into a state of civil war. Maintaining control over Luanda and the lucrative oil fields of the Atlantic coastline, Agostinho Neto, the leader of the MPLA, declared the independence of the Portuguese Overseas Province of Angola as the People&#x27;s Republic of Angola on 11 November 1975, in accordance with the Alvor Accords. 

UNITA and FNLA together declared Angolan independence in Huambo. These differences reignited civil war between UNITA &amp; FNLA and the MPLA, with the latter winning the upper hand. Agostinho Neto became the first president upon independence. He was succeeded after his death in 1979 by José Eduardo dos Santos.

In 1974–1976, South Africa and Zaire intervened militarily in favor of FNLA and UNITA. The United States strongly aided the two groups. Cuba in turn intervened in 1975 to aid the MPLA against South African intervention, and the Soviet Union aided both Cuba and the MPLA government during the war. 

In November 1980, the MPLA had all but pushed UNITA into the bush, and the South African forces withdrew. The United States Congress barred further U.S. military involvement in the country, against the wishes of President Ronald Reagan, as the representatives feared getting into a situation similar to the Vietnam War. In 1976 the FNLA withdrew its troops to their bases in Zaire. Part of them joined the 32 Battalion, formed by South Africa in order to receive anti-MPLA Angolans.

At its first congress in 1977, the MPLA adopted Marxism–Leninism as the party ideology. It added &quot;Partido do Trabalho&quot; (Labour Party) to its name.

After Nito Alves&#x27;s attempted &quot;coup&quot; in 1977, Neto ordered the killing of suspected followers and sympathisers of &quot;orthodox communism&quot; inside and outside the party. During the coup, Cuban forces stationed in Angola sided with the MPLA leadership against the coup organizers. Estimates for the number of Alves&#x27; followers killed by Cuban and MPLA troops in the aftermath range from 2,000 — 70,000 dead, with some placing the death toll at 18,000. 

After the violent internal conflict called Fractionism, the MPLA declared that it would follow the socialist, not the communist, model. But it did maintain close ties with the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc, establishing socialist economic policies and a one-party state. Several thousand Cuban troops remained in the country to combat UNITA fighters and bolster the regime&#x27;s security.

When the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union fell, the MPLA abandoned its Marxist–Leninist ideology. On its third congress in December 1990, it declared social democracy to be its official ideology.

The MPLA emerged victorious in Angola&#x27;s 1992 general election, but eight opposition parties rejected the election as rigged. UNITA sent negotiators to Luanda, where they were killed. As a consequence, hostilities erupted in the city, and immediately spread to other parts of the country. Tens of thousands of UNITA and FNLA sympathizers were subsequently killed nationwide by MPLA forces, in what is known as the Halloween Massacre. The civil war resumed. 

The war continued until 2002, when UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi was killed. The two parties agreed to a ceasefire, and a plan was laid out for UNITA to demobilize and become a political party. More than 500,000 civilians were killed during the civil war. Human rights observers have accused the MPLA of &quot;genocidal atrocities,&quot; &quot;systematic extermination,&quot; &quot;war crimes&quot; and &quot;crimes against humanity during the civil war.&quot; Political scientist Rudolph Rummel estimated that the MPLA were responsible for between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths in democide from 1975 to 1987.

==Human rights record==
The MPLA government of Angola has been accused of human rights violations such as arbitrary arrest and detention and torture by international organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The MPLA government hired Samuels International Associates Inc in 2008 to help improve Angola&#x27;s global image and &quot;&#x27;facilitate&#x27; its meetings with senior U.S. officials&quot;.

==Party organizations==
At present, major mass organizations of the MPLA-PT include the Angolan Women&#x27;s Organization (&quot;Organização da Mulher Angolana&quot; or O.M.A.), National Union of Angolan Workers (&quot;União Nacional dos Trabalhadores Angolanos&quot; or U.N.T.A.), Agostinho Neto Pioneer Organization (&quot;Organização de Pioneiros de Agostinho Neto&quot; or O.P.A.), and the Youth of MPLA (&quot;Juventude do MPLA&quot; or J.M.P.L.A.).

==Foreign support==
During both the Portuguese Colonial War and the Angolan Civil War, the MPLA received military and humanitarian support primarily from the governments of Algeria, Brazil, the Bulgarian People&#x27;s Republic, East Germany, Cape Verde, Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the Congo, Cuba, Guinea-Bissau, Mexico, Morocco, the Mozambican People&#x27;s Republic, Nigeria, North Korea, the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, China, the Romanian Socialist Republic, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, the Soviet Union, Sudan, Tanzania, Libya and SFR Yugoslavia. While China did briefly support the MPLA, it also actively supported the MPLA&#x27;s enemies, the FNLA and later UNITA, during the war for independence and the civil war. The switch was the result of tensions between China and the Soviet Union for dominance of the communist bloc, which almost led to war.

== Electoral history ==
In the 1992 election, MPLA-PT won 53.74% of the votes and 129 out of 227 seats in parliament; however, eight opposition parties rejected the 1992 elections as rigged. In the next election, delayed until 2008 due to the civil war, the MPLA won 81.64% of the vote and 191 out of 220 parliamentary seats. In the 2012 legislative election, the party won 71.84% of the vote and 175 of 220 parliamentary seats.

In the 2022 general election, MPLA won 124 parliamentary seats and about 51% of the vote. The largest opposition party, UNITA, secured 44% of the vote and 90 parliamentary seats. The tight race was the MPLA&#x27;s worst showing at the polls in 30 years. However, nearly all opposition parties considered the result to be a fake.

== In popular culture ==
* In 1976, reggae singer Tapper Zukie dedicated the song and album titled &quot;M.P.L.A&quot; to the movement.
* Pablo Moses dedicated the song &quot;We Should be in Angola&quot; (which appeared on his album &quot;Revolutionary Dream&quot;) to the MPLA.
* The Sex Pistols singer John Lydon referred to the MPLA in the lyrics of &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;.
* The reggae band The Revolutionaries devoted an extended dub mix record to the movement entitled &quot;MPLA&quot;, recorded at Channel One, engineered by King Tubby and released on the &quot;Well Charge&quot; label. The bass line and rhythm was based on &quot;Freedom Blues&quot; by Little Richard. The Revolutionaries also released an extended discomix entitled &quot;Angola&quot;. Both tracks were later released on the &quot;Revolutionary Sounds&quot; album featuring Sly and Robbie.
* The video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 2&quot; features a level in which the player fought alongside the UNITA and Jonas Savimbi against the MPLA.
* The video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; sets Missions 13-29 within the environs of the Angola-Zaire border region. Several references to the MPLA, CFA, and UNITA are made--with the in-universe mercenary group Diamond Dogs (led by player character Venom Snake) clashing with or aiding them in different missions.

<text>Irvin Ferdinand Westheimer (September 19, 1879 – December 31, 1980) was an American businessman and social reformer, who is best remembered for being the founder of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.

==Biography ==
Westheimer, an American businessman, banker and philanthropist from Ohio, began the Big Brothers movement on July 4, 1903, when he discovered a young boy rummaging through a garbage pail outside the rear entrance to his office. Westheimer befriended the boy, who had no father, and began to urge his close friends to get involved as &quot;big brothers&quot; with other young boys from fatherless homes.

In 1908, Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt learned of the Big Brothers movement and organized the first &quot;Big Sisters&quot; program in New York City. The two organizations came together in 1977, and merged to become known as the Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America.

==Honours ==
Westheimer was honored by his native city of Cincinnati, Ohio as one of its most important people of the century in 2000. He died at the age of 101.

<doc id="347175" wikidata="Q3534236" url="?curid=347175" title="Pitman shorthand">
<text>Pitman shorthand is a system of shorthand for the English language developed by Englishman Sir Isaac Pitman (1813–1897), who first presented it in 1837. Like most systems of shorthand, it is a phonetic system; the symbols do not represent letters, but rather sounds, and words are, for the most part, written as they are spoken.

Shorthand was referred to as phonography in the 19th century. It was first used by newspapers who sent phonographers to cover important speeches, usually stating (as a claim of accuracy) that they had done so. The practice got national attention in the United States in 1858 during the Lincoln–Douglas Debates which were recorded phonographically. The shorthand was converted into words during the trip back to Chicago, where typesetters and telegraphers awaited them.

Pitman shorthand was the most popular shorthand system used in the United Kingdom and the second most popular in the United States.

One characteristic feature of Pitman shorthand is that unvoiced and voiced pairs of sounds (such as /p/ and /b/ or /t/ and /d/) are represented by strokes which differ only in thickness; the thin stroke representing &quot;light&quot; sounds such as /p/ and /t/; the thick stroke representing &quot;heavy&quot; sounds such as /b/ and /d/. Doing this requires a writing instrument responsive to the user&#x27;s drawing pressure: specialist fountain pens (with fine, flexible nibs) were originally used, but pencils are now more commonly used.

Pitman shorthand uses straight strokes and quarter-circle strokes, in various orientations, to represent consonant sounds. The predominant way of indicating vowels is to use light or heavy dots, dashes, or other special marks drawn close to the consonant. Vowels are drawn before the stroke (or over a horizontal stroke) if the vowel is pronounced before the consonant, and after the stroke (or under a horizontal stroke) if pronounced after the consonant. Each vowel, whether indicated by a dot for a short vowel or by a dash for a longer, more drawn-out vowel, has its own position relative to its adjacent stroke (beginning, middle, or end) to indicate different vowel sounds in an unambiguous system. However, to increase writing speed, rules of &quot;vowel indication&quot; exist whereby the consonant stroke is raised, kept on the line, or lowered to match whether the first vowel of the word is written at the beginning, middle, or end of a consonant stroke—without actually writing the vowel. This is often enough to distinguish words with similar consonant patterns. Another method of vowel indication is to choose from among a selection of different strokes for the same consonant. For example, the sound &quot;R&quot; has two kinds of strokes: round, or straight-line, depending on whether there is a vowel sound before or after the R.

There have been several versions of Pitman&#x27;s shorthand since 1837. The original Pitman&#x27;s shorthand had an &quot;alphabet&quot; of consonants, which was later modified. Additional modifications and rules were added to successive versions. Pitman New Era (1922–1975) had the most developed set of rules and abbreviation lists. Pitman 2000 (1975–present) introduced some simplifications and drastically reduced the list of abbreviations to reduce the memory load, officially reduced to a list of 144 short forms. The later versions dropped certain symbols and introduced other simplifications to earlier versions. For example, strokes &quot;rer&quot; (heavy curved downstroke) and &quot;kway&quot; (hooked horizontal straight stroke) are present in Pitman&#x27;s New Era, but not in Pitman&#x27;s 2000.

==History==
Pitman was asked to create a shorthand system of his own in 1838. He had used Samuel Taylor&#x27;s system for seven years, but his symbols bear greater similarity to an older system created by John Byrom. The first phonetician to invent a system of shorthand, Pitman used similar-looking symbols for phonetically related sounds. He was the first to use thickness of a stroke to indicate voicing (voiced consonants such as and are written with heavier and lighter lines than unvoiced ones such as /p/ and /t/), and consonants with similar place of articulation were oriented in similar directions, with straight lines for plosives and arcs for fricatives. For example, the dental and alveolar consonants are upright: = , = , = , = , = (as in &quot;thigh&quot;), = (as in &quot;thy&quot;).

Pitman&#x27;s brother Benjamin Pitman settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, in the United States and introduced Pitman&#x27;s system there. He used it in the 1865–67 trial of the conspirators behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In Australia the system was introduced by another Pitman brother, Jacob. Jacob Pitman is buried in Rookwood Necropolis, Sydney. His epitaph is written phonetically:
IN LUVING MEMERI OV JACOB PITMAN, BORN 28th NOV. 1810 AT TROWBRIDGE ENGLAND, SETELD IN ADELAIDE 1838, DEID 12TH MARCH 1890. ARKITEKT, INTRODIUST FONETIK SHORTHAND AND WOZ THE FERST MINISTER IN THEEZ KOLONIZ OV THE DOKTRINZ OV THE SEKOND OR NIU KRISTIAN CHURCH WHICH AKNOLEJEZ THE LORD JESUS CHRIST IN HIZ DEVEIN HIUMANITI AZ THE KREATER OV THE YUNIVERS, THE REDEEMER AND REJENERATER OV MEN. GOD OVER AUL, BLESED FOR EVER.

At one time, Pitman was the most commonly used shorthand system in the entire English-speaking world. Part of its popularity was due to the fact that it was the first subject taught by correspondence course. Today in many regions (especially the U.S.), it has been superseded by Gregg shorthand, developed by John Robert Gregg. Teeline has become more common in recent years, as it is based on spelling, rather than pronunciation.

==Writing==
Like Gregg shorthand, Pitman shorthand is phonemic: with the exception of abbreviated shapes called logograms, the forms represent the sounds of the English word, rather than its spelling or meaning. Unlike Gregg, pairs of consonant phonemes distinguished only by voice are notated with strokes differing in thickness rather than length. There are twenty-four consonants that can be represented in Pitman&#x27;s shorthand, twelve vowels, and four diphthongs. The consonants are indicated by strokes, the vowels by interposed dots.

===Logograms (Short Forms)===
Common words are represented by special outlines called logograms (or &quot;Short Forms&quot; in Pitman&#x27;s New Era). Words and phrases which have such forms are called grammalogues. Hundreds exist and only a tiny number are shown above. The shapes are written separately to show that they represent distinct words, but in common phrases (&quot;you are&quot;, &quot;thank you&quot;, etc.) two or three logograms may be joined together, or a final flick added to represent &quot;the&quot;.

===Consonants===
The consonants in Pitman&#x27;s shorthand are pronounced &quot;pee, bee, tee, dee, chay, jay, kay, gay, eff, vee, ith, thee, ess, zee, ish, zhee, em, el, en, ray ar, ing, way, hay,&quot; and &quot;yay&quot;. When both an unvoiced consonant and its corresponding voiced consonant are present in this system, the distinction is made by drawing the stroke for the voiced consonant &quot;thicker&quot; than the one for the unvoiced consonant. (Thus &quot;s&quot; is and &quot;z&quot; is .) There are two strokes for &quot;r&quot;: &quot;ar&quot; and &quot;ray&quot;. The former assumes the form of the top right-hand quarter of a circle (drawn top-down), whereas the latter is like &quot;chay&quot; , only less steep (drawn bottom to top). There are rules governing when to use each of these forms.

===Vowels===
The long vowels in Pitman&#x27;s shorthand are: . The short vowels are . The long vowels may be remembered by the sentence, &quot;Pa, may we all go too?&quot; , and the short vowels may be remembered by the sentence, &quot;That pen is not much good&quot; .

A vowel is represented by a dot or a dash, which is written with either a light stroke (for a short vowel) or heavy stroke (for a long vowel). For example, &quot;sate&quot; is written as &quot;)•|&quot;, but &quot;set&quot; is written as &quot;)·|&quot;; &quot;seat&quot; is written as &quot;).|&quot;, but &quot;sit&quot; is written as &quot;).|&quot;. Vowels are further distinguished by their position relative to the consonant stroke – beginning, middle or end – for a total of 12 possible combinations. 

Another feature of Pitman&#x27;s shorthand allows most vowels to be omitted in order to speed up the process of writing. As mentioned above, each vowel is written next to either the beginning, middle or end of the consonant stroke. Pitman&#x27;s shorthand is designed to be written on lined paper and when a word&#x27;s first vowel is a &quot;first position&quot; vowel (i.e. it is written at the beginning of the stroke), the whole shorthand outline for the word is written above the paper&#x27;s ruled line. For a second position vowel, the outline is written on the line, and for a third position vowel, it is written through the line. In this way, the position of the outline indicates that the first vowel can only be one of four possibilities. In most cases, this means that the first and often all the other vowels can be omitted entirely.

===Diphthongs===
formula_1

There are four diphthongs in Pitman&#x27;s shorthand, representing , , , , as in the words &quot;I enjoy Gow&#x27;s music.&quot; The first three appear as small checkmarks; the &quot;ew&quot; sound is written as a small arch. Both &quot;ie&quot; and &quot;oi&quot; are written in first position, while &quot;ow&quot; and &quot;ew&quot; are written in third position. In the same way, the whole outline is placed above, on or through the paper&#x27;s ruled line. If the diphthong is followed by a neutral vowel, a little flick is added.

===Other shapes===
;Circles: Circles are of two sizes – small and large. A small circle represents &#x27;s&#x27; (&quot;sing&quot;) and &#x27;z&#x27; (&quot;gaze&quot;). A large circle at the beginning of a word represents the double consonant &#x27;sw&#x27; (&quot;sweep&quot;). Elsewhere it represents &#x27;s-s&#x27;: a sequence of two &#x27;s&#x27; or &#x27;z&#x27; sounds with a vowel in between (&quot;crisis&quot;, &quot;crises&quot; or &quot;exercise&quot;). The vowel in the middle may be any of the vowels or diphthongs, though any vowel other than &#x27;e&#x27; must be notated inside the circle.

;Loops:Loops are of two sizes – small and large. The small loop represents &#x27;st&#x27; and &#x27;sd&#x27; (&quot;cost&quot; and &quot;based&quot;). The large loop represents &#x27;ster&#x27; (&quot;master&quot; or &quot;masterpiece&quot;). The &#x27;ster&#x27; loop is not used at the beginning of a word; i.e, it would not be used to notate the word &quot;sterling&quot;.

;Hooks
:Stroke-initial hooks. For straight strokes, an initial hook may be written in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. A clockwise initial hook represents &#x27;r&#x27; after the stroke (&quot;tray&quot;, &quot;Nichrome&quot;, &quot;bigger&quot;). A counter-clockwise initial hook represents &#x27;l&#x27; after the stroke (&quot;ply&quot;, &quot;amplify&quot;, &quot;angle&quot;). For curved strokes, the hook is written inside the curve and a small hook represents &#x27;r&#x27; while a large hook represents &#x27;l&#x27;.
:Stroke-final hooks. For straight strokes, a final hook may be written in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. A clockwise final hook represents &#x27;en&#x27; after the stroke (&quot;train&quot;, &quot;chin&quot;, &quot;genuine&quot;), while a counter-clockwise final hook represents &#x27;eff&#x27; or &#x27;vee&#x27; after the stroke (pave, calf, toughen). For curved strokes, the hook is written inside the curve and it represents &#x27;n&#x27; after the stroke (&quot;men&quot;, &quot;thin&quot;).
:&#x27;Shun&#x27; hook. A large hook written at the end of a stroke represents the sound &#x27;shun&#x27; or &#x27;zhun&#x27;, as in &quot;fusion&quot; or &quot;vision&quot;. The &#x27;shun&#x27; hook is written either to the left or right depending on the positions of other attachments and vowels in the stroke. 

===Halving and doubling===
;Halving: Many strokes (both straight and curved) may be halved in length to denote a final &#x27;t&#x27; or &#x27;d&#x27;. The halving principle may be combined with an initial or final hook (or both) to make words such as &quot;trained&quot; appear as a single short vertical light stroke with an initial and final hook. There are some exceptions to avoid ambiguous forms; for example, a straight-r stroke can&#x27;t be halved if it&#x27;s the only syllable, because that might be confused for some other short-form (logogram) consisting of a short-stroke mark in that direction (&quot;and&quot; or &quot;should&quot;).

;Doubling: If a word contains &#x27;ter&#x27;, &#x27;der&#x27;, &#x27;ture&#x27;, &#x27;ther&#x27;, or &#x27;dher&#x27; — for example, in &quot;matter&quot;, &quot;nature&quot;, or &quot;mother&quot; — the preceding stroke is written double the size. There are exceptions to avoid ambiguous forms; for example, &quot;leader&quot; is not written as a doubled-l but as l plus a hooked-d representing &quot;dr&quot;. In contrast, &quot;later&quot;, for example, is written with a doubled-l. Straight strokes at the beginning of a word are not doubled unless they have a final hook or attached diphthong.

<text>The White Main ( or &quot;Weißmain&quot;, not to be confused with the Weismain), is the larger and shorter of the two headstreams of the river Main. It rises in the Fichtel Mountains and merges near Steinenhausen, southwest of Kulmbach, with the left-hand, southern headstream, the Red Main, to form the Main. The length of the White Main is 51.7 km. The source of the White Main lies on light granite rock, which lends it its white colouration.

== Sources ==
The source of the White Main is a wellspring located at 887 m above NN on the eastern slope of the Ochsenkopf. Margrave Frederick fixed it and had it enclosed in granite blocks in 1717. He also had the Hohenzollern coat-of-arms carved into the granite. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited the spring in 1785, but reckoned the Seehausbrunnen southeast of the Schneeberg as the source of the Main, for he wrote: &quot;...the source of the Main, which rises close to the house here and where the stream here amounts to a no more than a tin washtub, ...&quot;.

Although the Red Main is a few kilometres longer, the source of the larger White Main is seen as that of the Main.

== Course ==

Initially, the &quot;White Main&quot; flows steeply downhill towards the northeast. After about it feeds a small lake near Karches in the municipality of Bischofsgrün. Shortly thereafter, it changes direction abruptly to the northwest and cuts its way through a narrow valley. Just before Fröbershammer it leaves the granite of the central massif. Near Fröbershammer it meets the &quot;Kroppenbach&quot; which enters from the right. Near Rangen it turns towards the southwest and flows through a very, narrow, wild, scenic gorge. At the far end it reaches a mill, the &quot;Glasermühle&quot;, where it is joined from the left by the &quot;Brombergsbach&quot; and, shortly thereafter, by the &quot;Lützelmain&quot;, also known as the &quot;Lützelmainbach&quot;. After that it also picks up the little &quot;Steinbach&quot;. Near Bad Berneck-Schmelz the &quot;Schmelzbach&quot; and the &quot;Zoppatenbach&quot; enter it from the left. The &quot;White Main&quot; now turns northwest, passes through the village of Frankenhammer before reaching Bad Berneck. Here it is joined from the right by the &quot;Ölschnitz&quot; and the &quot;Rimlasgrundbach&quot;. It then passes north of Blumenau, where it merges with the &quot;Obere Wiesenbächlein&quot; and, immediately afterwards, the &quot;Untere Wiesenbächlein&quot;, from the left-hand side.

Near Kremitz it meets the left-hand tributary of the &quot;Kronach&quot; coming from the southeast. It passes through Lanzendorf und Himmelkron, where it is met from the right by the &quot;Streitmühlbach&quot;, near Neuenmarkt-Schlömen and then the &quot;Laubenbach&quot;. Next it alters course towards the west, until it reaches Trebgast, where it picks up the stream of the same name coming from the south. It then swings northwest and flows past Feuln, collecting the waters of the &quot;Feulnerbach&quot;; then the &quot;Veitsgraben&quot; near Ködnitz and the &quot;Mühlgraben&quot;. It travels through Fölschnitz and Kauerndorf, where it is joined by the Schorgast. It now runs in a southwesterly direction past Aichig, where it is fed by the &quot;Teufelsgraben&quot;, and enters Kulmbach. There it is met by the &quot;Purbach&quot; and the Dobrach from the right and the &quot;Kinzelsbach&quot; from the left. At the western edge of Kulmbach, near Steinhausen Castle, the White Main finally merges with the Red Main to form the River Main.
== Fauna ==
The &quot;White Main&quot; is home to the eel, grayling, brown trout, brook trout, barbel, perch, carp bream, pike, carp, rainbow trout, roach, rudd and tench.

<text>Robert Laurence Mills (April 15, 1927 – October 27, 1999) was an American physicist, specializing in quantum field theory, the theory of alloys, and many-body theory. 

While sharing an office at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Frank Yang Chen-Ning and Robert Mills formulated in 1954 a theory now known as the Yang–Mills theory – &quot;the foundation for current understanding of how subatomic particles interact, a contribution which has restructured modern physics and mathematics.&quot;

Mathematically, Yang and Mills proposed a tensor equation for what are now called Yang–Mills fields (this equation reduces to Maxwell&#x27;s equations as a special case; see gauge theory):
: formula_1.

== Biography ==
Mills was born in Englewood, New Jersey, son of Dorothy C. and the american economist Frederick C. Mills. He graduated from George School in Pennsylvania in early 1944, and studied at Columbia College from 1944 to 1948, while on leave from the Coast Guard. Mills demonstrated his mathematical ability by becoming a Putnam Fellow in 1948, and by receiving first-class honors in the Tripos. Mills, who was still a novice theoretical physicist, met Yang and assisted him in polishing Yang&#x27;s hypothesis on non-abelian gauge fields, which later became the Yang-Mills Theory, and consequently the heart of modern physics.

Employing the general field theory developed by him and Yang Cheng Ning in the 1950s, H. Fritzsch and H. Leutwyler, together with american physicist Murray Gell-Mann introduced the concept of colour as the source of a &quot;strong field&quot; into the theory of QCD. Thus, Yang and Robert Mills, together, were key to the progress in the field, by developing a theory in which the carrier particles of a force can themselves radiate further carrier particles. (This is different from QED, where the photons that carry the electromagnetic force do not radiate further photons).

The mathematical ability Mills displayed early on was mastered in his eventual career as a full-time theoretical physicist. He earned a master&#x27;s degree from Cambridge, and a PhD in Physics under Norman Kroll, from Columbia University in 1955. After a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, Mills became professor of physics at Ohio State University in 1956. He remained at Ohio State University until his retirement in 1995.

Mills and Yang shared the 1980 Rumford Premium Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for their &quot;development of a generalized gauge invariant field theory&quot; in 1954.

== Personal life ==
Mills was married to Elise Ackley in 1948. Together they had sons Edward and Jonathan, and daughters Katherine, Susan, and Dorothy. The Mills family lived for many years in Columbus, Ohio during Mills&#x27; tenure as professor at Ohio State University. He was an elder of Indianola Presbyterian Church and active in the international student community in Columbus. 
The family also spent considerable time during the summer and winter breaks at their property on Echo Lake in Charleston, Vermont, where Robert spent his final months.

<text>Kulmbach is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Kronach, Hof, Bayreuth and Lichtenfels.

==History==

The historical centre of the region was the castle of Plassenburg in the city of Kulmbach. In 1135 this castle was first mentioned. The rulers of the castle and the surrounding lands were the counts of Andechs (1135–1248, from 1135 to 1180 Dießen-Andechs, from 1180 to 1248 Andechs-Meranien) and the Thuringian counts of Orlamünde (1260–1340). After the death of the last count of Orlamünde the region fell to the Hohenzollern state.

In 1398 the Hohenzollern state was divided, and in the Franconian area the two states of Ansbach and Kulmbach were founded. When the Hohenzollern family was awarded the margravate of Brandenburg, these states were called Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Kulmbach, but not united with Brandenburg proper. In 1603 the castle of Plassenburg was abandoned, and the capital was moved to the city of Bayreuth. The importance of the city of Kulmbach declined hereafter, although the margraves (and sometimes the population of Kulmbach) often used to take shelter on the castle during the years of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The last margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth (as Brandenburg-Kulmbach was called now) abdicated in 1792 in order to cede his property to his cousin, the king of Prussia. However, this was a short episode. In 1806 Kulmbach surrendered to Napoleon, who ordered the razing of Plassenburg castle. In 1810 the region fell to Bavaria and remained so to date.

The district of Kulmbach was founded soon after. The city of Kulmbach did not belong to the district until 1972, when city and district were merged.

According to a tour guide in Kulmbach, the castle Plassenburg was used by Adolf Hitler as the headquarters for his Highway Department. The highway &quot;A9&quot; was built under Nazi rule, connecting Berlin and Munich, and running past Kulmbach.

After the Second World War, the castle was used as a camp for German prisoners of war under the US military control. One of those stayed employed later as a keeper of natural and biological resources of the castle.

The city is also known for a brewery, producing the strongest beer (11.8% alcohol) available in Germany.

<text>Anita Pallenberg (6 April 1942 – 13 June 2017) was an Italian-German film actress, artist, and model. A style icon and &quot;It Girl&quot; of the 1960s and 1970s, Pallenberg was credited as the muse of the Rolling Stones: she was the romantic partner of the Stones multi-instrumentalist, Brian Jones, and later, from 1967 to 1980, the partner of Stones guitarist Keith Richards, with whom she had three children.

== Early life ==
Pallenberg was born on 6 April 1942 in Rome, according to most sources. However, after her death in 2017, several news sources such as the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Marlon Richards had corrected her place of birth, stating that his mother had in fact been born in Hamburg. Her parents were Arnold &quot;Arnaldo&quot; Pallenberg, a German-Italian sales agent, amateur singer, and hobbyist painter, and Paula Wiederhold, a German embassy secretary. The family was separated because of World War II, and she did not see her father until she was three years old. Her father, a descendant of the Pallenberg family dynasty from Cologne, who were renowned as furniture manufacturers and patrons of the arts, later sent her to a boarding school in Germany so that she would learn the language. She became fluent in four languages at an early age.

Pallenberg was expelled from school when she was 16, after which she spent time in Rome with the &quot;Dolce Vita&quot; crowd, and then went to New York City to hang out with Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory. She then began her career as a fashion model in Paris. She studied medicine, picture restoration and graphic design without ever completing a degree. Before settling in London, she had lived in Germany and Rome, as well as in New York City, where she was active in the Living Theatre, starring in the play &quot;Paradise Now&quot;, which featured onstage nudity, and Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory.

== Film and fashion ==
Pallenberg appeared in over a dozen films over a 40-year span. One of her first appearances was as the Great Tyrant in Roger Vadim&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968); however, the character&#x27;s actual voice was dubbed by Joan Greenwood. She played the sleeper wife of Michel Piccoli in &quot;Dillinger Is Dead&quot; (1969), directed by Marco Ferreri. Pallenberg also had roles in the German crime thriller &quot;A Degree of Murder&quot; (1967), which featured music composed by Brian Jones; the cult film &quot;Candy&quot; (1968) as James Coburn&#x27;s possessive nurse; Volker Schlöndorff&#x27;s &quot;Michael Kohlhaas – Der Rebell&quot; (1969), which was filmed in Slovakia; and the avant-garde &quot;Performance&quot; (1970), in which she played the role of Pherber. &quot;Performance&quot; was shot in 1968, but a nervous studio delayed its release.

Pallenberg appeared in a documentary about the Rolling Stones, &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; (1968), directed by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard. In an interview she gave &quot;The Independent,&quot; which published it on 16 March 2007, she related her encounters in Rome while &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960) was being filmed, with its director Federico Fellini, other filmmakers such as Luchino Visconti and Pier Paolo Pasolini, and with the novelist Alberto Moravia.

In 1985, for the video of &quot;Wild Boys,&quot; Duran Duran used a clip of Pallenberg from
&quot;Barbarella.&quot; She portrayed &quot;The Queen&quot; in the comedy-drama &quot;Mister Lonely&quot; by Harmony Korine, and played a character named Sin in &quot;Go Go Tales&quot; (both 2007).

In the 1990s, Pallenberg returned to education to study fashion. She graduated from Central Saint Martins in London in 1994 with a fashion and textile degree. However, she decided not to forge ahead with a career in fashion, finding it too cutthroat and cruel.

Pallenberg has been portrayed several times by other performers. Monet Mazur played a young Pallenberg in the film &quot;Stoned&quot; (2005), a biographical film about the last year of Brian Jones&#x27;s life, while the NBC television show &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; (2006) included a story arc in which the character Harriet Hayes was hired to play Pallenberg in a film.

== The Rolling Stones ==
=== Romantic relationships ===
Pallenberg is known for her romantic involvement with Rolling Stones band members Brian Jones and later Keith Richards. Pallenberg first met the band in 1965 in Munich, where she was working on a modelling assignment. Jones spoke German and they began a friendship that turned into a two-year relationship. She later recalled that they took a lot of acid during this time, and it caused Jones to have nightmares. She ended her relationship with Jones in 1967 after he became violent toward her during a vacation in Morocco, where he was then hospitalised. He died in 1969.

In Morocco, Keith Richards saw Jones assaulting Pallenberg, pulled her away and then took her back to England, where she moved in with him. In 1981, Richards stated that he still loved Pallenberg, although he had already met his future wife, Patti Hansen.

Pallenberg denied further affairs, both in March 2007 when &quot;Performance&quot; was released on DVD and again during an interview in 2008.

=== Influence on the Rolling Stones ===
Pallenberg&#x27;s burgeoning relationship with Jones encouraged him to experiment musically in their 1966 album &quot;Aftermath&quot;, while her intelligence and sophistication both intimidated and elicited envy from the other Stones. Pallenberg played an unusual role in the male-dominated world of rock music in the late 1960s, with Jagger respecting her opinion enough for tracks on &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; to be remixed after she criticised them. In the 2002 compilation release of &quot;Forty Licks&quot;, Pallenberg is credited as singing background vocals on &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;.

Tony Sanchez&#x27;s account of his time as Richards&#x27;s bodyguard and drug dealer mentions Pallenberg&#x27;s spiritual practices: &quot;She was obsessed with black magic and began to carry a string of garlic with her everywhere—even to bed.&quot; Sanchez goes on to describe Pallenberg as having been &quot;like a life-force, a woman so powerful, so full of strength and determination that men came to lean on her&quot;. 

Jo Bergman, who was the band&#x27;s personal assistant from 1967 to 1973, said of Pallenberg: &quot;Anita is a Rolling Stone. She, Mick, Keith and Brian were the Rolling Stones. Her influence has been profound. She keeps things crazy.&quot;

In the 1977 Toronto heroin arrest, Pallenberg pled guilty to marijuana possession and was convicted and fined several weeks after Richards&#x27; arrest.

Pallenberg was a friend of singer Marianne Faithfull, Jagger&#x27;s girlfriend in the late 1960s. They appeared together in the fourth series (2001) of the BBC sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; in episode four, &quot;Donkey&quot;, with Faithfull playing God and Pallenberg the Devil.

=== Death of Scott Cantrell ===
On 20 July 1979, 17-year-old Scott Cantrell shot himself in the head in Pallenberg&#x27;s bed with a gun owned by Keith Richards, while at the South Salem, New York, house shared by Richards and Pallenberg. The youth had been employed as a part-time groundsman. Richards was in Paris recording with the Rolling Stones and Pallenberg was arrested; however, the death was ruled a suicide in 1980.

== Personal life ==
Pallenberg and Richards had three children: son Marlon Leon Sundeep (born 10 August 1969), daughter Dandelion Angela (who goes by her middle name; born 17 April 1972), and son Tara Jo Jo Gunne (born 26 March 1976 – 6 June 1976). Tara Jo Jo died in his cot ten weeks after birth; the cause of death has been stated as SIDS or pneumonia.

Pallenberg first became pregnant in 1968, but since she had already signed on to be part of the film &quot;Performance&quot; she felt that she was pressured to have an abortion, which caused her to feel extremely resentful. She became pregnant again, with Marlon, during the filming.

After Tara Jo Jo&#x27;s death, Keith&#x27;s mother blamed Pallenberg and said she was an unfit mother, and took Angela to live with her. Pallenberg raised Marlon mostly on the road with the band. When Marlon was eight, she moved into a house on Long Island, New York, so he could have a more routine life and go to school. In later years, she lived principally in Chelsea, London, spending winters in Jamaica.

At one point, Pallenberg expressed interest in writing a memoir, but ultimately decided not to pursue the venture. &quot;The publishers want to hear only about the Stones and more dirt on Mick Jagger and I&#x27;m just not interested&quot;, she said in 2008. &quot;I had several publishers and they were all the same. They all wanted salacious. And everybody is writing autobiographies and that&#x27;s one reason why I&#x27;m not going to do it. If young Posh Spice&quot;.

=== Health problems ===
Pallenberg suffered from hepatitis C, and had two hip surgeries, including a hip replacement, which caused her to walk with a limp. After detoxing in the early 1980s, Pallenberg abstained from drug use but later had a relapse. In 2014, she said she had been 14 years sober from drugs. She stopped drinking in 1987, but had a relapse with alcohol in 2004 after her second hip surgery. She regularly attended AA meetings. In August 2016, she told Alain Elkann in an interview when asked about growing old, &quot;I am ready to die. I have done so much here. My Mum died at 94. I don’t want to lose my independence. Now I am over 70 and to be honest I did not think I would live over 40&quot;.

== Death ==
Pallenberg died on 13 June 2017, aged 75, due to complications from hepatitis C&quot;.
