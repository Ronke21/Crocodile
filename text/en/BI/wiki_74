<text>Henri Déricourt (2 September 1909 − 21 November 1962), code named Gilbert and Claude, was a French agent in 1943 and 1944 for the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive organization during World War II. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially those occupied by Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.

Déricourt was the organiser (leader) of the Farrier network (or circuit) in France. Déricourt&#x27;s job with SOE was air movements officer. He found clandestine landing fields for RAF airplanes and organized receptions for the arrival and departure of flights to convey SOE agents back and forth from England to France. Déricourt also acted as a postman, collecting mail and messages from SOE agents for transmittal to SOE headquarters in London with the airplane pilots. He was highly successful at the job and came into contact with many agents of Prosper, the SOE&#x27;s largest and most important network in France.

In the summer of 1943, the Prosper network was destroyed by the Germans with the arrest of hundreds of Prosper network associates and the execution of many, including Francis Suttill, the leader of the network. 
Déricourt&#x27;s service with SOE was controversial and he is widely believed to have been a German agent. He is accused of betraying the Prosper network to the Germans. After the war he was tried but acquitted of being a double agent who worked for the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD), the intelligence arm of the German SS. The theory has also been advanced by some authors that Déricourt was a triple agent working under British instructions and that the betrayal of many SOE agents was an attempt by the British intelligence agency, MI6, to mislead the Germans about the date of the invasion of France by allied forces. M.R.D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, believed that Dericourt was a German agent but debunked the assertion that Dericourt was a triple agent.

==Early life==
Henri Alfred Eugène Déricourt was born in Coulonges-Cohan, Aisne, France on 2 September 1909. His father worked for the post office and his mother was a domestic servant. He was trained as a military pilot in 1930, but left military service in 1932 to join an aerial circus. In 1935, he joined Air Bleu as a pilot and flew mail around France from then until the beginning of World War II in 1939. In 1936, he also became involved with French intelligence services and delivered aeroplanes to the Spanish Republican Army in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War.

In Paris in 1937 and 1938, according to author Robert Marshall, Déricourt met and became friends with two people who would become important in his life: a British journalist named Nicolas Bodington, later to become the second ranking officer in the French section of SOE, and a German policeman, Karl Boemelburg, assigned to the German Embassy and later the head of the SD in Paris.

On 13 December 1941 Déricourt married a recently divorced woman, Jean Rose &quot;Jeannot&quot; Gamerre. He &quot;was devoted to Jeannot, but never faithful&quot; staying with Julienne Aisner when he was in Paris. He later recruited Aisner to work for him in SOE. Déricourt had the reputation of being a &quot;witty, self-confident and extremely persuasive charmer, particularly with the ladies.&quot; His friend, fellow pilot Hugh Verity, said that Dericourt &quot;was unscrupulous enough and arrogant enough to think that he could outsmart anyone--but that he was by nature a man who would not stab his friends in the back.&quot;

==World War II and SOE==
At the beginning of World War II, Déricourt flew civilian aircraft supplying French soldiers stationed near the border with Germany and later as a test pilot of a new French bomber. With the surrender of France in June 1940, he was involved in black market activities. He renewed his friendship with Boemelburg, now SD chief in Paris. Beginning in July 1941, he was a pilot for an airline in Vichy France, at that time unoccupied by Germany. He also came into contact with American intelligence officials as a source of information.

In August 1942, Déricourt, unhappy in Vichy and leaving his wife behind, was transported by ship to Britain. He was investigated by MI5 (Security Service) which said that it was &quot;unable to guarantee his reliability.&quot; Despite those concerns he was subsequently recruited by MI6 (Secret Intelligence Service) before having his name and credentials passed to the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in November 1942. Déricourt&#x27;s old friend, Nicolas Bodington, now the second in command of SOE&#x27;s French section, endorsed his employment enthusiastically.

===Air operations===
SOE had difficulties with the Royal Air Force which reluctantly supplied the planes and pilots for SOE&#x27;s clandestine operations. The RAF complained about the large number of failed missions. Déricourt with his experience as a pilot and his knowledge of France seemed like a godsend. On the night of 22/23 January 1943, Déricourt was parachuted &quot;blind&quot; (without anybody meeting him) into France near Orléans. He made his way to Paris, reunited with his wife, and, perhaps by coincidence, moved into a house next door to the house where Abwehr spy catcher Hugo Bleicher lived. The SD headquarters of old friend Karl Boemelburg was at 82 Avenue Foch, a short walk away. The two met shortly after Déricourt arrived in Paris. Déricourt lived openly under his own name, saying he was too well known to use an alias.

Déricourt soon assembled his Farrier team, consisting of Aisner as his courier and another old friend, pilot Rémy Clément, as an assistant. He relied on the Prosper network led by Francis Suttill for a radio operator, Jack Agazarian. Andrée Borrel helped Aisner with the courier duties. Through courier Lise de Baissac, Déricourt also established links with the large SOE Scientist network on the Atlantic Ocean coast of France, which also needed his services to move agents. These extensive links among networks, although understandable as Déricourt serviced several networks, violated SOE&#x27;s doctrine that for security reasons networks should be independent of each other with as little contact as possible between and among networks and even among members of the same network.

Déricourt&#x27;s first air operation was the night of 17/18 March 1943 when he met two Westland Lysander airplanes landing near Poitiers which delivered four SOE agents and boarded four others to return to England. The operation was successful and his success continued. Over the next eleven months, he supervised 17 air operations in which 22 aircraft landed at more than six different clandestine airfields and delivered 43 SOE agents to France and took 67 back to England. The air operations were also a means of communications between the London headquarters of SOE and its agents in France. Déricourt was the &quot;postman&quot; who collected letter and reports from agents and gave them to the pilots of the airplanes to take back to England. Unlike wireless messages which were always transmitted in code, most of these letters and reports were in clear language although code names were supposed to be used for people and places.

===Suspicions===
The first known criticism by SOE agents in France of Déricourt was in June 1943 when Jack Agazarian complained to London that Déricourt&#x27;s security was faulty. Several more agents complained in July about &quot;Gilbert&quot; although in the terse language of wireless transmissions it was unclear whether they meant Déricourt, code named Gilbert, or Gilbert Norman, deputy to Francis Suttill, the leader of the Prosper network. In summer 1943, the Prosper network was destroyed by the Germans. Suttill, Norman and many other members and associates of the Prosper network were captured. Francis Suttill&#x27;s son lists approximately 180 SOE agents and French associates arrested of whom about 80 were executed or died in concentration camps, including Suttill and Norman. Given the clandestine involvement of many people, that list is incomplete.

SOE was not immediately aware of the fate of Prosper because the Germans used a captured SOE wireless to feed false information to SOE in London. Déricourt remained at large, and continued to organize aircraft landings into France. In October 1943 veteran resistor Henri Frager took a Déricourt-organized flight to London with the objective of telling SOE that Déricourt was a German agent. Senior SOE staff members and French Section leader Maurice Buckmaster refused to believe the reports and Déricourt continued his work in France until February 1944 when he was recalled to London. An investigation was inconclusive, but he was not allowed to return to France. Buckmaster later said that Déricourt &quot;never once let any of our boys down and that he has by far the finest record of operations completed of any member of SOE.&quot;

===Investigations===
Déricourt&#x27;s complicity in the arrests of SOE agents was revealed after the war, when war crimes investigators received definite information from German sources that Déricourt had been one of their agents and that the information he provided had led to the arrest and execution of many SOE agents and hundreds of their French associates. In fall 1946, SOE spymaster Vera Atkins interviewed Dr. Josef Goetz, formerly an SD officer in Paris and now a captive of the allies in England. Goetz said that agent &quot;Gilbert&quot; worked for Boemelburg. Gilbert&#x27;s task was to photograph all the agent&#x27;s mail and SOE documents given to him to be sent back to England by aircraft. He gave copies to Boemelburg who passed them down to Goetz. Thus, the SD acquired personal and operational information about SOE agents which aided in their capture and interrogation and enabled the SD to conduct a disinformation campaign with captured radios. Goetz had met &quot;Gilbert&quot; on several occasions and identified Déricourt as &quot;Gilbert&quot; from a photograph Atkins showed him.

In January 1947, Atkins located Sturmbannfuhrer Hans Josef Kieffer, who had been a senior German intelligence officer in Paris and commandant of the SD unit at 84 Avenue Foch. She interviewed him in a prison in Germany. She asked him whether there was a traitor among the SOE agents. Kieffer replied, &quot;You know yourself there was one...Gilbert...He was Boemelburg&#x27;s agent...in fact he was more than an agent. He was a friend going back a very long time...He had the symbol BOE-48, Boemelburg&#x27;s 48th agent.&quot; She asked for the identity of &quot;Gilbert&quot; and BOE-48. Kieffer answered: &quot;Of course, you know. It was Henri Déricourt.&quot;

===Trial===
On 22 November 1946, Déricourt was arrested by French police in Paris and on 26 November he was charged with having had &quot;Intelligence With the Enemy&quot; and further investigations were authorized to &quot;establish the consequence of Déricourt&#x27;s treason.&quot; However, by the time of Déricourt&#x27;s June 1948 trial in Paris, Josef Kieffer, Atkin&#x27;s principal source of Déricourt&#x27;s identification as a German agent, had been executed for war crimes. Her other source, Dr. Goetz, had changed his story to say that he did not know whether Agent BOE-48 was in fact Déricourt. &quot;Most extraordinary of all&quot; in the words of author Sarah Helm, nobody representing SOE was at the trial to give evidence against Déricourt. To the contrary, Nicolas Bodington, formerly the deputy in the French section of SOE and Déricourt&#x27;s old friend, testified that he had known and approved of Déricourt&#x27;s contacts with the Germans and said, &quot;I had total trust in Déricourt and recommended he maintain his contacts with the Germans.&quot; Déricourt was quickly acquitted after Bodington&#x27;s testimony. Vera Atkins and other SOE agents were infuriated and accused Bodington as being a &quot;perjurer.&quot;

===Conspiracy theories===
The British foreign policy establishment was never enthusiastic about the existence of SOE, regarding it as a terrorist organization. Historian John Keegan later said that &quot;SOE besmirched Britain.&quot; After World War II, MI6 &quot;could not snuff out its awkward wartime rival fast enough and the Foreign office was delighted to see an end to the organisation that had interfered so much with quiet diplomacy.&quot; Despite those efforts, SOE attracted the attention of many authors and film makers.

Author Jean Overton Fuller tracked down Déricourt in the early 1950s and he told her that he had handed over copies of SOE agent&#x27;s mail to the Germans, but was acting on the instructions of another British agency. The speculation developed that MI6 had planted Déricourt in SOE to keep tabs on its competitor. Later, the speculation expanded to the belief that MI6 employed Déricourt to deceive the Germans about Allied plans to invade France. One version of the speculation as expressed by some authors is that the British government told unwitting SOE agents to prepare for an allied invasion of France in September 1943 (the invasion did not occur until June 1944) with the knowledge that some SOE agents would be captured by the Germans. Under questioning some of the captured agents told the Germans that they believed an invasion was forthcoming in 1943. The objective of the deception was to persuade the Germans to keep soldiers in France to defend against an invasion, rather than transferring them to the eastern front to fight against the Soviet Union which Britain feared was near collapse. Déricourt&#x27;s role was to copy and give to the Germans the correspondence of SOE agents which hinted that an invasion was upcoming. He also gave them personal information about agents.

The theory that SOE was deliberately betrayed by MI6 has been widely criticized. The official SOE historian, M.R.D. Foot said, &quot;if you can believe that, you can believe anything.&quot; The son of SOE agent Francis Suttill, who was captured and executed, also debunked the theory that SOE agents were sacrificed in a disinformation campaign of MI6. However, authors Robert Marshall and Patrick Marnham (writing in 2020) are among those who have asserted the opposite: SOE agents of the Prosper network in France were sacrificed as part of the deception plans of British intelligence.

==Post-war activities==
Despite his acquittal, Déricourt&#x27;s reputation was destroyed and he went through a lean spell before returning to his profession as a pilot. In the 1950s he found employment with Aigle Azur, Air Liban, and SAGETA (&quot;Société Auxiliaire de Gérance et de d&#x27;Exploitation Transport Aeriens&quot;) before becoming involved in drug-running activities in Indochina.

Officially employed by the government-owned airline, Air Laos, Déricourt flew a twin-engined Beech 18 (C-45) for Air Laos Commerciale, a concern that was often referred to by the name &#x27;Air Opium&#x27;. The drug trade was organized by Bonaventure &#x27;Rock&#x27; Francisci of the Corsican Mafia. The loads of raw opium were picked up on dirt strips in Northern Laos and transported to drop points in South Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Gulf of Thailand for onward transport to the Marseilles &#x27;French Connection&#x27; heroin trade.

==Death==
On 21 November 1962, Déricourt took off from Vientiane, Laos for Sayaboury with a load of gold and four passengers, but the plane crashed short of the landing strip due to fuel starvation. There were no survivors. His body was never recovered.

<text>Brian G. Hughes (c. 1849–1924) was an American businessman and practical joker.

Hughes was a paper-box manufacturer and a vice-president, later president of the Dollar Savings Bank.

==Practical jokes==
Once he &quot;donated&quot; a plot of ground in Brooklyn to the Board of Aldermen who planned to have it made a public park. It turned out to be a 2- x 8-foot plot of ground near 6th Avenue and 63rd Street. He also donated a mansion he claimed Marquis de Lafayette had lived in during the American War of Independence - actually a badly kept house at 147th Street and Concord Avenue in the Bronx. A local historical society tried to have him committed to an asylum for this prank.

Hughes might have been the first to drop fake diamonds in front of the Tiffany&#x27;s jewelry store and watch greedy people try to grab them. This prank was later used as a film gag by the Marx Brothers. He placed empty picture frames and tools in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which led to a search for apparently stolen paintings. He also distributed tickets to non-existent events.

He masqueraded as a Prince of Absdam, Cyprus and Aragon and pretended to hoist a title of Princess of the order of St Catherine of Mount Sinai to actress Lavinia Queen.

Hughes &quot;forgot&quot; expensive umbrellas in public places with an expectation that someone would try to take them. They were gimmicked to drop a banner that read &quot;stolen from Brian G. Hughes&quot; when they were opened.

Two of Hughes&#x27;s hoaxes involved animal shows. He once bought an alley cat from a hobo, cleaned the animal up and entered it in a prestigious cat show as &quot;Nicodemus, by Broomstick out of Dustpan by Sweeper, the last of the exotic Brindle breed&quot;. According to Hughes, the cat ate only chicken and ice cream. The cat won a ribbon, but the hoax was eventually exposed. Later, Hughes bought a retired trolley horse and entered it in a horse show as &quot;Orphan Puldeca, out of Metropolitan by Electricity&quot;. The crowd was impressed by the horse&#x27;s ability to respond to bells. The hoax was revealed when a judge deciphered the horse&#x27;s name: Often Pulled the Car.

He claimed to have organized an expedition to South America to find a rare animal called the &quot;reetsa&quot; (&quot;a steer&quot; spelled backwards). According to Hughes, the animal had always avoided capture despite its habit of always walking backward. For over a month, reporters got &quot;progress reports&quot; from Hughes&#x27;s &quot;expedition&quot;. When he returned to New York, Hughes unveiled the animal by having it walk backward down the gangplank.

==Death==
Hughes&#x27;s obituary identified him as &quot;the famous practical joker and banker&quot;.

<doc id="351738" wikidata="Q334530" url="?curid=351738" title="John Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland">
<text>William John Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland (17 September 1800 – 6 December 1879), styled Lord John Bentinck before 1824 and Marquess of Titchfield between 1824 and 1854, was a British Army officer and peer, most remembered for his eccentric behaviour. A recluse who preferred to live in seclusion, he had an elaborate underground maze excavated under his estate at Welbeck Abbey near Clumber Park in North Nottinghamshire.

==Life==
He was born in London, the second son of William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland, and his wife Henrietta, daughter of General John Scott. He was baptised at St George&#x27;s Church, Hanover Square, on 30 September. One of nine children, he was known by his second Christian name, John, as all the male members of the family were named William. He was the brother of Charlotte Denison, future wife of Evelyn Denison, 1st Viscount Ossington.

Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck was educated at home rather than at school. Known as Lord John Bentinck, he served in the army from 1818, entering as an ensign in the Foot Guards and later transferred to the 7th Light Dragoon Guards in 1821, where he became a captain, then the 2nd Life Guards in 1823. He reportedly suffered from lethargy due to his &quot;delicate health&quot;.

In 1824, he became known as Marquess of Titchfield following the death of his elder brother William Henry, and was elected Tory member of parliament (MP) to succeed his brother in King&#x27;s Lynn, a seat traditionally held by a member of his family.

He remained an MP until 1826, when he surrendered his seat on grounds of ill-health to his uncle Lord William Bentinck.

From 1824 to 1834, he also held the rank of captain in the Royal West India Rangers, on half pay, a sinecure, since this regiment had been disbanded in 1819.

After leaving the army, he spent some time in continental Europe, his health being occasionally poor. His ailments included short-term memory loss and sciatica.

On 27 March 1854, he succeeded his father as 5th Duke of Portland. Although the title also gave him a seat in the House of Lords, it took him three years to take his seat, not taking the oaths until 5 June 1857. He showed little interest in taking an active role in politics, although he supported the Whigs and Robert Peel. From 1859 until his death he was also Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire.

==Welbeck Abbey==
The duke&#x27;s major building operations and developments at his estate of Welbeck Abbey in which he took an active involvement appealed strongly to the popular imagination. They cost an enormous sum of money and employed thousands of men from the local area, both skilled and unskilled. While there were occasional labour disputes over wages and hours, the duke was on very good terms with his many employees and earned the nickname &quot;the workman&#x27;s friend&quot;.

===Grounds===
The house&#x27;s kitchen gardens covered encased in high walls with recesses in which braziers could be put to ripen fruit. One of the walls, for peaches, measured over in length.

An immense riding house was constructed, long, wide, and high. It was lit by 4,000 gas jets. His stables held 100 horses but he never rode them in his riding house.

When roller skating became popular, he had a rink installed near the lake for the benefit of his staff, whom he encouraged to use it.

===House===
The duke had all the rooms of Welbeck Abbey stripped of furniture, including tapestries and portraits, which he had stored elsewhere. He occupied a suite of four or five rooms in the west wing of the mansion which were sparsely furnished. By 1879, the building was in a state of disrepair, with the duke&#x27;s rooms the only habitable ones. All the rooms had been painted pink, with bare parquetry floors and no furniture apart from a commode in one corner.

===Underground===
The duke&#x27;s father, believing there would be a shortage of oak, had hundreds of trees planted. His son used the wood to construct a complex of underground rooms and tunnels. The tunnels under the estate were reputed to have totalled , connecting various underground chambers and above-ground buildings. They included a long tunnel between the house and the riding house, wide enough for several people to walk side by side. A more roughly constructed tunnel ran parallel to this for the use of his workmen. A long tunnel ran north-east from the coach house, to emerge at the south Lodge, which was supposedly wide enough for two carriages. It had domed skylights (readily visible on the surface) and by night was illuminated by gaslight.

The underground chambers—all of which were painted pink—included a great hall long and wide, which was originally intended as a chapel, but which was instead used as a picture gallery and occasionally as a ballroom. The ballroom reportedly had a hydraulic lift that could carry 20 guests from the surface and a ceiling that was painted as a giant sunset. The duke never organised any dances in the ballroom.

Other subterranean rooms included a long library, an observatory with a large glass roof, and a vast billiards room.

==Eccentricity==
The duke was highly introverted and well known for his eccentricity; he did not want to meet people and never invited anyone to his home. He employed hundreds through his various construction projects, and though well paid, the employees were not allowed to speak to him or acknowledge him. The one worker who raised his hat to the duke was promptly dismissed. The tenants on his estates were aware of his wishes and knew they were required to ignore him if they passed by. His rooms had double letterboxes, one for in-coming and another for out-going mail. Only his valet was permitted to see him in person in his quarters—he would not even let the doctor in, while his tenants and workmen received all their instructions in writing.

His business with his solicitors, agents, and the occasional politician was handled by post. The duke maintained an extensive correspondence with a wide-ranging network of family and friends, including Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Palmerston. He is not known to have kept company with any ladies and his shyness and introverted personality increased over time. His reclusive lifestyle led to rumours that the duke was disfigured, mad, or prone to wild orgies, but contemporary witnesses and surviving photographs present him as a normal-looking man.

He ventured outside mainly by night, when he was preceded by a lady servant carrying a lantern ahead of him. If he did walk out by day, the duke wore two overcoats, an extremely tall hat, an extremely high collar, and carried a very large umbrella behind which he tried to hide if someone addressed him.

If the duke had business in London, he would take his carriage to Worksop where he had it loaded onto a railway wagon. Upon his arrival at his London residence, Harcourt House in Cavendish Square, all the household staff were ordered to keep out of sight as he hurried into his study through the front hall.

He insisted on a chicken roasting at all hours of the day and the servants brought him his food on heated trucks that ran on rails through the tunnels.

==Children==
There is evidence to believe that the duke had a daughter, Fanny (later Fanny Lawson; 1855–1917), and possibly two sons, William (c. 1852–1870) and Joseph, all of them illegitimate. Fanny had two sons, George and Bertram Lawson, both of whom served with distinction in the military during World War I, and has numerous descendants living today. The duke had numerous intimate and discreet relationships during his lifetime, and his family was told that due to an accident in his youth he would probably be unable to have children. That diagnosis was incorrect; a modern medical opinion considers infertility &quot;unlikely&quot; as a result of that accident.

==Death==
The duke died on 6 December 1879 at his London residence, Harcourt House. He was buried in a simple grave in a large plot at Kensal Green Cemetery close to the Anglican chapel. As his younger brother, Henry William, had died without male issue on 31 December 1870, the title of Duke of Portland devolved upon his cousin William Cavendish-Bentinck.

The department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham, holds a number of papers relating to the 5th Duke: the 5th Duke&#x27;s personal and political papers (Pw K) are part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection; and the Portland (London) Collection (Pl) contains papers relating to the estate business of the 5th Duke, and to the &quot;Druce Case&quot;. The Harley Gallery shows exhibitions from the Portland Collection, in the museum which is situated in the converted site of the Fifth Duke&#x27;s Gas Works.

The Portland Estate Papers held at the Nottinghamshire Archives also contain items relating to the 5th Duke&#x27;s properties.

==Druce case==

In 1897, a widow, Anna Maria Druce, claimed that the duke had led a double life as her father-in-law, Thomas Charles Druce of the furniture business Druce &amp; Co., who had supposedly died in 1864. The widow claimed that the duke had faked the death of his alter ego Druce to return to a secluded aristocratic life and that therefore her son was heir to the Portland estate. Her application to have Druce&#x27;s grave in Highgate Cemetery opened to show that the coffin buried in it was empty and weighted with lead was blocked by Druce&#x27;s executor. The case became the subject of continuing and unsuccessful legal proceedings.

When it was discovered that Druce&#x27;s children by a former wife were living in Australia, Anna Maria Druce&#x27;s claims were backgrounded, but she was placed in an asylum in 1903. The case was taken up by George Hollamby Druce from 1903 onwards, who set up companies to finance his legal proceedings in 1905, and in 1907 even instituted a charge of perjury against Herbert Druce, the elder son of Thomas Charles Druce by his second wife, for having sworn that he had witnessed his father&#x27;s death in 1864. Herbert had been born before his parents&#x27; marriage and thus was not eligible to claim the Portland title even if his father had been the duke.

The photograph which illustrates this article is that produced by the prosecution as being of the duke, but the defence denied this and said it was of Druce. Evidence of a fake burial was given by a witness named Robert C. Caldwell of New York and others, and it was eventually agreed that Druce&#x27;s grave should be opened. This was done on 30 December 1907 under the supervision of Inspector Walter Dew and Druce&#x27;s body was found present and successfully identified. Caldwell&#x27;s evidence was so unreliable that the prosecution disowned him during the trial, and it transpired that he had habitually appeared in court giving sensational, and false, testimony. He was found insane and died in an asylum in 1911. Several witnesses were in turn charged with perjury.

==In popular culture==
* R. Austin Freeman&#x27;s crime novel &quot;Dr. Thorndyke Intervenes&quot; (1933) was based on the Druce-Portland case.
* &#x27;The Portland Millions&#x27;, episode 3 of the 1976 Granada television series &quot;Victorian Scandals&quot;, is entirely devoted to the case.
* In 1997, Mick Jackson published a book loosely based on the duke&#x27;s life called &quot;The Underground Man&quot;, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.
* Bill Bryson discusses him in some detail during a visit to Welbeck Abbey in the travel book &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot;.
* The Druce-Portland case is the subject of detailed examination in the book &quot;The Dead Duke, His Secret Wife, and the Missing Corpse&quot;, published in September 2014.

<doc id="351740" wikidata="Q1747746" url="?curid=351740" title="Robert Coates (actor)">
<text>Robert &quot;Romeo&quot; Coates (1772 – 21 February 1848) was an English eccentric, best remembered for his career as an amateur actor. His self-image included a highly mistaken belief in his own thespian prowess. Born in Antigua in the West Indies and educated in England, he began to appear in plays in Bath in 1809, and became notorious for his fondness for appearing in leading roles. His favourite part was the male lead in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, hence his widely used nickname. After professional theatrical producers failed to cast Coates in roles prominent enough to satisfy him, he used his family fortune to subsidise his own productions in which he was both the producer and the lead actor.

Coates claimed to be the best actor in Britain. He would appear in bizarre costumes of his own design, invent new scenes and dialogue mid-show, and repeat parts of the play he particularly liked—usually dramatic death scenes—up to three or four times a night. His fame quickly spread and people flocked to see whether Coates was really as bad as they had heard. They laughed, jeered, and pelted (i.e. threw things at) him; Coates sometimes turned to the audience and answered in kind. By 1816 audiences had tired of mocking Coates, and theatre managers were no longer willing to let him use their premises. After some years living in France to avoid creditors, he returned to England, married in 1823, and had two children who both predeceased him. Coates died in London in 1848, aged about 76, after a Hansom cab driver hit him outside the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

==Biography==

===Actor===
Robert Coates was born in Antigua in the West Indies, the only surviving child of a wealthy sugar planter, Alexander Coates, and his wife Dorothy. He was educated in England, and on returning to Antigua took part in amateur dramatics. When he inherited his father&#x27;s estate and a large collection of diamonds in 1807, he moved to Bath, England, where he lived as a man of fashion. He eventually drew the attention of the manager of the Theatre Royal, Bath and had begun to appear in plays in 1809, though not as a professional actor.

Later he appeared in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in the part of Romeo – in a costume of his own design. The costume had a flowing, sky-blue cloak with sequins, red pantaloons, a vest of white muslin, a large cravat, and a plumed &quot;opera hat,&quot; according to Captain Rees Howell Gronow – not to mention dozens of diamonds – which was hardly suitable for the part. The garments were too small for Coates and caused him to move stiffly, and at some point, the seat of his pants split open. The audience roared with laughter.

Despite this ridicule, Coates went on to tour the British Isles. If a theatre manager would hesitate to let him show his talents, he would bribe them. Managers, in turn, often called in the police in case things went seriously wrong.
Coates was convinced he was the best actor in business – or at least that is what he claimed. He frequently forgot his lines and invented new scenes and dialogue on the spot. He loved dramatic death scenes and would repeat them – or any other scenes he happened to take a fancy to – three to four times over.

Coates claimed that he wanted to improve the classics. At the end of his first appearance as Romeo he came back in with a crowbar and tried to pry open Capulet&#x27;s tomb. In another of his antics he made the actress playing Juliet so embarrassed that she clung to a pillar and refused to leave the stage. Eventually no actress would agree to play the part with him.

The audience usually answered with angered catcalls, embarrassed jeering, and a large pelting of orange peels – and loads of laughter. His fellow actors would try to make him leave the stage. If Coates thought the audience was getting out of hand, he turned to them and answered in kind.

His fame spread and people would flock to see whether he really was as bad as they had heard. For some reason, Baron Ferdinand de Géramb became his foremost supporter. Even the Prince Regent (the future King George IV) would go to see him. In 1811, when he played the part of Lothario in &quot;The Fair Penitent&quot; in London&#x27;s Haymarket Theatre, the theatre had to turn thousands of would-be spectators away. In another performance in Richmond, Surrey, several audience members had to be treated for excessive laughter.

Coates went on with his antics. Once, when he dropped a diamond buckle when he was going to exit the stage, he crawled around the stage looking for it. During his first performance of Romeo &amp; Juliet, he pulled out his snuff box in the middle of a scene and offered some to the occupants of a box. Then, during Romeo&#x27;s death scene, Coates carefully placed his hat on the ground for a pillow and used his dirty handkerchief to dust the stage before lying on it. Finally, at the invitation of the audience, he acted out Romeo&#x27;s death twice—and was about to attempt a third before his Juliet came back to life and interrupted him. The amusement of the audience was enormous. There is some question as to whether Coates believed he was a great actor as he professed to, or if his performances were brilliant parody.

===Offstage===

Outside the stage Coates tried to amaze the public with his taste in clothing. He wore furs even in hot weather. He went out in a custom-built carriage with a heraldic device of a crowing cock and the motto &quot;While I live, I&#x27;ll crow&quot;. In receptions he glittered from head to toe with diamond buttons and buckles. His predilection for diamonds of all kinds gave him the nickname &quot;Diamond Coates&quot;.

Coates was the victim of a prank orchestrated by Theodore Hook, who had famously coordinated the Berners Street hoax in 1810, a few years before. The Prince Regent was at the time holding &quot;a fête of surpassing magnificence&quot; at Carlton House, and Coates &quot;in his glory- murdering Shakespeare at the Haymarket&quot;; imitating the Chamberlain&#x27;s handwriting, Hook produced a ticket &quot;commanding the presence of Signor Romeo&quot; and, dressing himself in fine scarlet livery, delivered this flattering but fake invitation to Coates in person. Hook waited to watch Coates embark for the event in his carriage, &quot;bedizened in all his finery, with a diamond-hilted sword and the air of Louis le Grand&quot;. Coates was invited in, but on examination of the ticket he was &quot;politely informed that a mistake had occurred&quot;, and turned away. Having sent off his carriage, he was obliged to wait at the Hackney carriage stand. The Prince, unwittingly involved in Hook&#x27;s prank, regretted that Coates had been turned away, observing him to be an &quot;inoffensive gentleman&quot;, and noting that &quot;his presence might have amused many of the guests, and could have done harm to no one.&quot; The Prince sent his secretary the next day, inviting Coates to come and look at the &quot;arrangements and ornaments&quot; which were still all in place; Coates duly went. It was observed of Hook that, &quot;to do him justice&quot;, he &quot;never told the story without some signs of compunction.&quot;

Coates was never a professional actor, and only made his stage appearances in support of charitable causes: his own nickname of choice was &#x27;the Celebrated Philanthropic Amateur&#x27;. After 1816 his performances ceased, as audiences had tired of laughing at him and theatrical managers were wary of allowing him use of their premises. Later he fell into financial difficulties and to avoid creditors moved to Boulogne-sur-Mer, where he met Emma Anne Robinson, daughter of a naval lieutenant. After Coates put his finances back into better order they returned to England and were married on 6 September 1823. The two lived quietly in London, living lastly at his residence, 28 Montagu Square. They had two children, both of whom predeceased Coates. Emma remarried in the year of Coates&#x27;s death, her second husband being Mark Boyd.

Robert Coates died in London in 1848 after a street accident. He was caught and crushed between a Hansom cab and a private carriage as he was leaving a performance at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 15 February, and died at home six days later. At his inquest the coroner brought in a verdict of manslaughter by person or persons unknown. He is buried in an unmarked grave in Kensal Green Cemetery.

<text>Cassie L. Chadwick (10 October 1857 – 10 October 1907) was the most well-known pseudonym used by Canadian con artist Elizabeth Bigley, who defrauded several American banks out of millions of dollars during the late 1800s and early 1900s by claiming to be an illegitimate daughter and heiress of the Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie. Newspaper accounts of the time described her as one of the greatest con artists in American history. She pulled off the scam in the Gilded Age of American history, during which time women were not allowed to vote or get loans from the banks, leading some historians to refer to her bank heist as one of the greatest in American history.

==Early life==

Cassie Chadwick was born Elizabeth Bigley on October 10, 1857, in Appin, Canada West. She was the third daughter in a family of two boys and six girls born to Daniel and Mary Ann Bigley. Daniel was a railroad section hand. Three years later, the Bigleys moved to a small farm near Eastwood, Canada West. At sixteen, Betsy ran away from home, but was apprehended by police after attempting to obtain a $250 promissory note from a prosperous farmer. In 1878, Betsy was arrested for attempting to borrow money on a stolen pocket watch. Her father settled with the victim. Within the year, in Toronto, Betsy attempted to present herself as Elizabeth Cunard of the wealthy shipping family using a forged letter of introduction and a bogus check. After acquiring $10,000 in goods on credit, the scheme collapsed and Betsy fled Toronto. In March 1879, Betsy was arrested in Woodstock, Ontario, for attempting to negotiate forged promissory notes. She supplemented the notes with a calling card that read &quot;Miss Bigley, Heiress to $15,000.&quot; Betsy stood trial on March 22, 1879, for passing forged notes. Her lawyers employed the insanity defense bolstered by Betsy&#x27;s aberrant behavior in court. The jury found her not guilty. Her family sent her to live with her married sister, Alice York, whose husband was a Cleveland machinist.

==Start in the United States==
After a brief stay with her sister and brother-in-law, Chadwick rented the lower floor of a house at 149 Garden Street, Cleveland from a Mrs. Brown. Claiming to be widowed, Chadwick assumed the name Madame Lydia DeVere and set up shop as a clairvoyant with funds from a bank loan on her sister and brother-in-law&#x27;s furniture. 

In 1882, as Lydia DeVere, Chadwick married Dr. Wallace Scott Springsteen in Cleveland. Springsteen was a veteran of the civil war 

The couple exchanged vows before a justice of the peace on 21 November. She took the name Mrs. Lydia Springsteen and moved into the doctor&#x27;s house at 3 Garden Street. A photograph and story of the wedding appeared in &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; newspaper. The article led Chadwick&#x27;s sister, Alice York, and various tradespeople to the home of Springsteen to demand payment for debts his wife had accumulated. After Springsteen confirmed the stories about Chadwick&#x27;s past, he threw her out of the house. Springsteen filed for divorce (which was granted early in 1883) and settled her debts. They had been married twelve days.

After the dissolution of her first marriage, Chadwick re-established herself as a clairvoyant. As Madame Marie LaRose, she married John R. Scott, a farmer from Trumbull County, Ohio. She convinced Scott to sign a prenuptial agreement, citing abuse from her first husband. After four years of farm life, Chadwick went to a lawyer in Youngstown and left a sworn statement confessing adultery. She directed her lawyer to file for divorce from Scott.

After Chadwick&#x27;s marriage to Scott was dissolved, she married yet again to fter divorcing the farmer, she married this time to a wealthy businessman by the name of C.L. Hoover. 

Chadwick would go on to give birth to a son in 1886 or 1887, who went by the name of Emil Hoover in Cleveland. Its unknown if he was the son of Chadwick&#x27;s third husband. At the death of her third husband in 1888, it was claimed that he left Chadwick about $50,000 in his will.

==First U.S. fraud trial==
In 1889 Chadwick was convicted and sentenced to years in a penitentiary in Toledo for forgery. She was paroled in 1893 and returned to Cleveland.

==Chadwick&#x27;s third husband==
Upon returning to Cleveland in 1893, Chadwick assumed the name Mrs. Cassie Hoover and opened a brothel on the city&#x27;s west side. At the brothel, she met her next husband, a wealthy widower doctor named Leroy Chadwick. Knowing of the doctor&#x27;s recent loss, Chadwick played the part of a genteel widow who ran a respectable boarding house for women. When Leroy Chadwick responded that the establishment was a well-known brothel, &quot;Mrs. Hoover&quot; fainted. Once revived, she claimed that she would never run such an establishment. She begged the doctor to immediately take her from the building, lest anyone think she was complicit in its operation.

==As Cassie Chadwick==

In 1897 Cassie and Leroy were married. During her time as the wife of the highly respected Dr. Chadwick, it is unclear whether he knew that she had a son. Also, it is unclear whether Dr. Chadwick knew that Emil was in the care of one of the women at the brothel. When charged with forgery, Chadwick identified herself in court records as single with no children. However, in the 1900 United States census (District 97, Cleveland, Cuyahoga County Ohio), she identified herself as Cassie Chadwick, born 3 February 1862 in Pennsylvania. Her son Emil was enumerated as Emil Chadwick, born September 1886 in Canada. Chadwick&#x27;s spending habits exceeded those of her richer neighbours along Cleveland&#x27;s Euclid Avenue, then known as &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Row&quot;. Instead of being welcomed into the exclusive enclave of the Rockefellers, the Hannas, the Hays and the Mathers, Chadwick was thought of as a curious woman who tried in vain to buy the favors of some of the wealthiest families in the nation. When invited to social events, it was only out of obligation to her husband.

==The Carnegie con==
Following her marriage in 1897, Chadwick began her largest, most successful con game: that of establishing herself as Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s daughter. During a visit to New York City, she asked one of her husband&#x27;s acquaintances, a lawyer named Dillon, to take her to Carnegie&#x27;s home. In reality, Chadwick visited Carnegie&#x27;s housekeeper while ostensibly trying to check credentials. When Chadwick came back, she dropped a paper. Dillon took it up and noticed it was a promissory note for $2 million with Carnegie&#x27;s signature. When Dillon promised to keep Chadwick&#x27;s secret, she &quot;revealed&quot; that she was Carnegie&#x27;s illegitimate child. Carnegie was supposedly so wracked with guilt that he showered huge amounts of money on her. Chadwick also claimed that there was $7 million in promissory notes tucked away in her Cleveland home, and she was to inherit $400 million upon Carnegie&#x27;s death. Dillon arranged a safe deposit box for her document.

The information leaked to the financial markets in northern Ohio, and banks began to offer their services to Chadwick. For the next eight years, she used her fake background to obtain loans that eventually totaled around $2 million ($ in today&#x27;s currency). Chadwick relied on the assumption that no one would ask Carnegie about an illegitimate daughter for fear of embarrassing him. Since the loans also came with usurious interest rates, the bankers would not admit to granting them. Chadwick forged securities in Carnegie&#x27;s name for further proof. Bankers assumed that Carnegie would vouch for any debts and that they would be fully repaid once Carnegie died.

Chadwick carried out a lavish lifestyle as a result of her con. She bought diamond necklaces, enough clothes to fill 30 closets, and a gold organ. She became known as &quot;the Queen of Ohio.&quot; She claimed to give money to the poor and to the suffrage movement.

In November 1904, Chadwick received a $190,000 loan from Herbert B. Newton, a Brookline, Massachusetts banker. Newton was shocked when he learned of the other loans Chadwick had received, and called his loan in. Chadwick could not pay, and Newton sued. At the time, she had accumulated debts over $1 million. It was also discovered that a number of securities being held for her in various banks were worthless. When Carnegie was later asked about her, through a spokesman he denied ever knowing her. Carnegie further stated he had not signed a promissory note in more than 30 years. Chadwick fled to New York, but was soon arrested at her apartment at the Hotel Breslin and taken back to Cleveland. When she was arrested, she was wearing a money belt containing over $100,000. Leroy Chadwick and his adult daughter hastily left Cleveland for a European tour when the scandal broke. He filed for divorce before leaving on the tour.

The news sent shock waves through the Cleveland banking community. Citizen&#x27;s National Bank of Oberlin, which had loaned her $800,000, suffered a massive run that forced it into bankruptcy.

==Second U.S. fraud trial==
Andrew Carnegie attended Chadwick&#x27;s trial, wishing to see the woman who had successfully conned the nation&#x27;s bankers into believing that she was his heir. Other attendees included members of the Millionaires&#x27; Row families from whom she had tried so hard to gain acceptance. The trial was a media circus. On 10 March 1905 a Cleveland court sentenced her to 14 years in prison and a fine of $70,000 for conspiracy to bankrupt the Citizen&#x27;s National Bank and conspiracy against the government (Citizen&#x27;s Bank, as a federally chartered bank, was an agent of the federal government).

==Prison==
On 1 January 1906, Chadwick was sent to the Ohio State Penitentiary in Columbus. She brought with her trunks of goods for her prison cell, including clothing, photographs, and furniture. The prison warden allowed this due to her celebrity status.

As her health deteriorated, Chadwick began writing explicit instructions for her funeral. She instructed her son Emil to send a portion of her hidden funds to Canada for the purchase of a tombstone for the family plot. Chadwick suffered a &quot;nervous collapse&quot; on 17 September 1907, leaving her blind. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on 9 October 1907 that Chadwick was suffering from heart and stomach problems.

==Death==
Chadwick died on her 50th birthday in the Columbus penitentiary, 10 October 1907. The funeral service was officiated by Reverend F.W. Thompson. Her interment was 16 October 1907 in the Episcopal Cemetery (present day Woodstock Anglican Cemetery &quot;A&quot; section VanSittart Avenue) in her birthplace of Woodstock.

==Fallout==
For a time, the Chadwick Mansion on Euclid Avenue and East 82nd Street became a tourist destination. In the early 1920s, it was torn down for the construction of the Euclid Avenue Temple (now Liberty Hill Baptist Church).

Chadwick&#x27;s housekeeper, Mary Londraville, took a satchel apparently for Chadwick&#x27;s son that the receiver wanted as he thought it to have contained valuables.

Andrew Carnegie himself was so distressed about how his name had been misused, he made a gift that helped build the Oberon Carnegie Building, used by Oberlin College Library.

==In popular culture==
ILLEGITIMATE, a feature script based on Cassie Chadwick—who was the greatest female con-artist ever—placed as semi-finalist in the Writer&#x27;s Lab 2021. It is currently in development.

Chadwick was the subject of the Canadian TV movie &quot;Love and Larceny&quot; (1985), where the role of Betsy Bigley was played by Jennifer Dale.
Wendy Crewson portrays Chadwick in &quot;The Murdoch Sting&quot; (January 27, 2014), episode 13 of season 7 of the Canadian television period drama Murdoch Mysteries

In Season 2 of the HBO TV Series The Gilded Age, the character of Maud Beaton is loosely based on Cassie Chadwick.

<text>Maria Monk (June 27, 1816 – summer of 1849) was a Canadian woman whose book &quot;Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk,&quot; or, &quot;The Hidden Secrets of a Nun’s Life in a Convent Exposed&quot; (1836) claimed to expose systematic sexual abuse of nuns and infanticide of the resulting children by Catholic priests in her convent in Montreal. The book is considered by scholars to be an anti-Catholic hoax.

&quot;Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk&quot; was published in January 1836. In it, Monk claimed that nuns of the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph of the Montreal convent of the Hôtel-Dieu, whom she called &quot;the Black Nuns&quot;, were forced to have sex with the priests in the seminary next door. The priests supposedly entered the convent through a secret tunnel. If the sexual union produced a baby, it was baptized and then strangled and dumped into a lime pit in the basement. Uncooperative nuns disappeared.

Monk&#x27;s story contains various inconsistencies. In her account, she stated that there were three convents in Montreal: &quot;1st. The Congregational Nunnery. 2d. The Black Nunnery, or Convent of Sister Bourgeoise. 3d The Grey Nunnery.&quot; The Congregational Nuns were the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal, founded by Marguerite Bourgeoys, not the Sisters of Charity, as Monk stated at the beginning of her text; the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph, whose habits were black but who were not typically called &quot;Black Nuns&quot;, operated the Hotel-Dieu, where Monk claimed that she entered and suffered, and it was not founded by &quot;Sister Bourgeoise [&quot;sic&quot;]&quot;; and it was the Sisters of Charity who were commonly known as the Grey Nuns.

It is known that Monk lived in an asylum in her early years and that one of the nuns mentioned in her story was actually a fellow patient in the asylum. There is some evidence that Monk had suffered a brain injury as a child. One possible result of this alleged injury could be that Monk might have been manipulated, and might not be able to distinguish between fact and fantasy. Another possible result of the alleged injury could be that Monk had little understanding of the devastating result of her claims. It has been suggested, though not proven, that Monk was manipulated into playing a role for profit by her publisher or her ghost writers. Scholars consider the book a hoax.

==Atmosphere of anti-Catholic sensationalism==
Monk’s book was published in an American atmosphere of anti-Catholic hostility (partly fueled by early 19th-century Irish and German Catholic immigration to the U.S.) and followed the 1834 Ursuline Convent Riots near Boston. These were triggered by an incident in which one of the nuns left the convent but was persuaded to return on the following day by her superior, Mother Mary St. George, and by the Bishop of Boston, the Most Reverend Benedict Fenwick. This incident immediately gave rise to the claim that the woman was being held in the convent against her will; a mob invaded and then burned down the convent in an effort to free her.

In 1835, Rebecca Reed published an anti-Catholic, gothic novel, a highly-colored account of her six months as an Episcopalian charity pupil at the Ursuline convent school in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Reed herself died of tuberculosis shortly after the publication of her book; her disease was widely believed to have been caused by the austerities to which she had been subjected at the convent.

Reed’s book became a bestseller, and Monk or her handlers might have hoped to cash in on the evident market for anti-Catholic horror fiction. Monk’s claims might have been modeled on the gothic novels that were popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries, a literary genre that had already been used to stoke anti-Catholic sentiments in such works as Denis Diderot&#x27;s &quot;La Religieuse&quot;. Monk’s story epitomizes the genre-defining elements of a young, innocent woman being trapped in a remote, old, gloomily picturesque estate, where she learns dark secrets and escapes after harrowing adventures.

Monk claimed that she had lived in the convent for seven years, became pregnant, and fled because she did not want her baby destroyed. She told her story to a Protestant minister, Rev. John Jay Slocum, in New York, who encouraged her to repeat it to a wider audience. According to the &quot;American Protestant Vindicator&quot;, by July 1836 the book had sold 26,000 copies. Other publishers later issued books that supported Monk’s claims or were close imitators, or else they published tracts that refuted the tale. Historian Richard Hofstadter called it, in his 1964 essay &quot;The Paranoid Style in American Politics&quot;, &quot;[p]robably the most widely read contemporary book in the United States before &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.&quot; Historian James M. O&#x27;Toole claimed it sold more copies than any book published before the American Civil War, save &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.

==Public furor==
Monk’s book caused a public outcry. Protestants in Montreal, Quebec, demanded an investigation, and the local bishop organized one. The inquiry found no evidence to support the claims, though many American Protestants refused to accept the conclusion and accused the bishop of dishonesty.

Colonel William Leete Stone Sr., a Protestant newspaper editor from New York City, undertook his own investigation. In October 1836, his team entered the convent and found that the descriptions in the book did not match the convent&#x27;s interior. During their first visit, the investigators were denied entry to the basement and the nuns’ personal quarters. There was much dispute regarding the existence of a tunnel leading to the nuns&#x27; residence. There were disputes regarding &quot;renovations to the nuns residence and if the &quot;tunnel &quot; had been filled in or not. Stone returned to New York, interviewed Monk and concluded that she had never been in the convent. On a later visit, he was given total access to all quarters. Stone’s team found no evidence that Monk had ever lived in the convent.

Monk disappeared from the public view. It was later discovered that she had spent the seven-year period in question in the Magdalen Asylum for Wayward Girls. One critic points out that a nun character in her book, Jane Ray, was actually residing with Monk at the Magdalen Asylum, rather than at the Hotel Dieu Nunnery. The Magdalen asylum building was a very small wooden building, quite different from the described nunnery of the book Monk wrote.

Many details of the story seem to have originated with Monk&#x27;s legal guardian, William K. Hoyte, an anti-Catholic activist, and his associates. The writers later sued each other for a share of the considerable profits, while Monk was left destitute.

==Later life==
Monk traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a lover whom historians often identify as Graham Monk. She penned a sequel, &quot;Further Disclosures of Maria Monk&quot;. When she gave birth to another child, Oliver (a brother to William), out of wedlock in 1838, most of her supporters abandoned her.

&quot;The Boston Pilot&quot; published this obituary for her on September 8, 1849: &quot;There is an end of Maria Monk; she died in the almshouse, still cooking as was her wont. Blackwell&#x27;s Island, New York, on Tuesday&quot;.

&quot;Awful Disclosures&quot; remained in print for years afterwards and was occasionally revived. There appear to have been two Australian editions (1920, 1940). The last recorded unsupplemented facsimile edition was published in 1977.

==Bibliography and subsequent editions==
Posthumous editions of &quot;Maria Monk&quot; were published in 1837 (New York: Howe and Bates), 1920 (Melbourne: Wyatt and Watt), 1940? (Brisbane: Clarion Propaganda Series),1962 (Hamden: Archon), and were often reprints or facsimiles of the original. In 1975, a microform format was made available from New Haven, Connecticut.

<doc id="351759" wikidata="Q810945" url="?curid=351759" title="Battersea Bridge">
<text>Battersea Bridge is a five-span arch bridge with cast-iron girders and granite piers crossing the River Thames in London, England. It is situated on a sharp bend in the river, and links Battersea south of the river with Chelsea to the north. The bridge replaced a ferry service that had operated near the site since at least the middle of the 16th century.

The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge commissioned by John, Earl Spencer, who had recently acquired the rights to operate the ferry. Although a stone bridge was planned, difficulties in raising investment meant that a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was initially opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicle traffic in 1772. The bridge was inadequately designed and dangerous both to its users and to passing shipping, and boats often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.

Although dangerous and unpopular, the bridge was the last surviving wooden bridge on the Thames in London, and was the subject of paintings by many significant artists such as J. M. W. Turner, John Sell Cotman and James McNeill Whistler, including Whistler&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and his controversial &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket&quot;.

In 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem &amp; Co. The narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, it is one of London&#x27;s least busy Thames bridges. The location on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.

== Background ==

Chelsea, about west of Westminster on the north bank of the River Thames, has existed as a settlement since at least Anglo-Saxon times. The Thames at this point inflects through a sharp angle from a south–north to an east–west flow, and the slow-moving and relatively easily fordable river here is popularly believed to be the site of Julius Caesar&#x27;s crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain. Chelsea enjoyed good road and river connections to the seat of government at Westminster and the commercial centre of the City of London since at least the 14th century. It was a centre of the British porcelain industry, and a major producer of baked goods – at peak periods almost 250,000 Chelsea buns per day were sold. By the 18th century it had large numbers of very prosperous residents.

Battersea, listed as &quot;Patricesy&quot; (St Peter&#x27;s Water) in the Domesday Book and first mentioned in records of 693 AD, on the south bank of the river opposite Chelsea, was by contrast low and marshy land, prone to flooding. Conditions were ideal for farming asparagus and lavender, and a small market town grew in the area based on the asparagus and lavender industries.

Although Chelsea and Battersea had been linked by ferry since at least 1550, the nearest fixed links between the two were Putney Bridge, upstream and opened in 1729, and Westminster Bridge, downstream, opened in 1746. In 1763 John, Earl Spencer, purchased the manor of Battersea, and consequently acquired ownership of the ferry service between Chelsea and Battersea.

The ferry was old and somewhat dangerous, and in 1766 Spencer formed the Battersea Bridge Company and sought and obtained Parliamentary consent to build &quot;a fine stone bridge&quot; across the Thames. The bridge was to be built between Cheyne Walk and Battersea, at the point where the river&#x27;s course turns sharply east towards Westminster, at a projected cost of £83,000 (about £ in 2025). The Earl had anticipated that many local residents would invest in the project, but soon found that there was widespread scepticism about the scheme. Only 15 investors, including the Earl himself, were willing to invest, and a total of only £17,662 (about £ in 2025) was raised, far less than was needed to finance the ambitious project.

== Old Battersea Bridge ==

Spencer calculated that the money raised would be sufficient to finance a modest timber bridge, and a design was commissioned from rising architect Henry Holland. The bridge was built to Holland&#x27;s designs by John Phillips, whose uncle Thomas Phillips had built the 1729 bridge at Putney. The bridge was opened to pedestrians in November 1771 while still incomplete. In 1772 a chalk and gravel surface was added and the bridge was opened to vehicle traffic. Tolls were charged on a sliding scale, ranging from d for pedestrians to 1 shilling for vehicles drawn by four or more horses. The bridge was never formally named, and was referred to on maps of the period as both &quot;Battersea Bridge&quot; and &quot;Chelsea Bridge&quot;.
The bridge was not a commercial success. It was long and only wide, making it impractical for larger vehicles to use. Holland&#x27;s design consisted of nineteen separate narrow spans, the widest being only wide, and boats found it difficult to navigate beneath the bridge; there were a number of accidents including serious injuries and deaths. Repeatedly rammed by passing shipping, the bridge required frequent costly repairs, and dividends paid to investors were low. During a particularly cold winter in 1795 the bridge was badly damaged by ice, necessitating lengthy and expensive reconstruction, and no dividends at all were paid for the next three years. Concerns were expressed in Parliament about the reliability of the bridge, and the Battersea Bridge Company was obliged to provide a ferry service at the same rate as the bridge tolls, in the event of the bridge being closed for repairs.

In an effort to improve the bridge&#x27;s poor safety record for its customers, oil lamps were added to the deck in 1799, making Battersea Bridge the first Thames bridge to be lit. Between 1821 and 1824 the flimsy wooden fences along the edges of the bridge, which were often breaking, were replaced by sturdy iron railings, and in 1824 the oil lamps were themselves replaced by gas lighting.
In 1873, in an effort to improve navigation around the bridge and reduce accidents, two of the piers were removed, making the widest span a more easily navigated , and the bridge deck was strengthened with iron girders to compensate for the missing piers.

=== Competition and disputes with Vauxhall Bridge ===
In 1806, a scheme was proposed by Ralph Dodd to open the south bank of the Thames opposite Westminster and London for development, by building a new major road from Hyde Park Corner to Kennington and Greenwich, crossing the river at Vauxhall, about halfway between Battersea Bridge and Westminster Bridge. The Battersea Bridge Company were concerned about the potential loss of custom, and petitioned Parliament against the scheme, stating that &quot;[Dodd] is a well known adventurer and Speculist, and the projector of numerous undertakings upon a large scale most if not all of which have failed&quot;, and the bill was abandoned. However, in 1809 a new bill was presented to Parliament for a bridge at Vauxhall, this time obliging the operators of the new bridge to compensate the Battersea Bridge Company for any losses, and the Company allowed it to pass and accepted compensation. The Act obliged the Vauxhall Bridge Company to reimburse the Battersea Bridge Company for any loss in revenue caused by the new bridge.

After many delays and setbacks, the new bridge at Vauxhall (initially named Regent Bridge after George, Prince Regent, but shortly afterwards renamed Vauxhall Bridge) opened on 4 June 1816. However, the Vauxhall Bridge Company failed to pay the agreed compensation to the Battersea Bridge Company and were taken to court. After a legal dispute lasting five years, a judgement was made in favour of the Battersea Bridge Company, with the Vauxhall Bridge Company being obliged to pay £8,234 (about £ in 2025) compensation.

=== Old Battersea Bridge in art ===

Although the bridge was inconvenient for its users and flimsily constructed, as the last surviving wooden bridge on the Thames in the London area it was considered an important landmark, and many leading artists of the period were attracted to it. Camille Pissarro, J. M. W. Turner, John Sell Cotman and John Atkinson Grimshaw produced significant paintings of the bridge. Walter Greaves, whose family owned a boathouse adjacent to the bridge and whose father had been boatman to Turner, painted numerous scenes of the bridge. Local resident and mentor to Greaves James McNeill Whistler created many images of it, including the influential Hokusai-inspired &quot;&quot; (painted –5), in which the dimensions of the bridge are intentionally distorted and Chelsea Old Church and the newly built Albert Bridge are visible through a stylised London fog.
Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Nocturne&quot; series achieved notoriety in 1877, when influential critic John Ruskin visited an exhibition of the series at the Grosvenor Gallery. He wrote of the painting &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket&quot;, that Whistler was &quot;asking two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public&#x27;s face&quot;. Whistler sued for libel, the case reaching the courts in 1878. The judge in the case caused laughter in the court when, referring to &quot;Nocturne: Blue and Gold – Old Battersea Bridge&quot;, he asked Whistler &quot;Which part of the picture is the bridge?&quot;; the case ended with Whistler awarded token damages of one farthing.

In 1905, &quot;Nocturne: Blue and Gold&quot; became the first significant acquisition by the newly formed National Art Collections Fund, and is now in Tate Britain.

=== Takeover and public ownership ===
A more modern and convenient competing bridge opened nearby at Chelsea Bridge in 1858, and usage of Battersea Bridge fell sharply. There were serious public concerns about the safety of the bridge by this time, after an 1844 incident in which a woman was murdered on the bridge in view of one of the toll collectors, who did not intervene because both parties had paid their fares.

The new Albert Bridge opened in 1873, less than from Battersea Bridge. Mindful of the impact the new bridge would have on older bridge&#x27;s financial viability, the 1864 Act of Parliament authorising the Albert Bridge compelled the Albert Bridge Company to purchase Battersea Bridge at the time of the new bridge&#x27;s opening and to compensate the owners of Battersea Bridge with £3,000 (about £ in 2025) per annum until the new bridge opened, and so Battersea Bridge was bought outright by the Albert Bridge Company in 1873. By this time the bridge was in extremely poor condition, and there were many calls from local residents for it to be demolished. As an interim measure, the Albert Bridge&#x27;s architect Rowland Mason Ordish strengthened the foundations of the bridge with concrete while debate continued as to its future.

The Metropolis Toll Bridges Act 1877 (40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. xcix) was passed, which allowed the Metropolitan Board of Works to buy all London bridges between Hammersmith and Waterloo Bridges and free them from tolls, and in 1879 the Board of Works bought Albert and Battersea bridges for a combined cost of £170,000 (about £ in 2025) and the tolls were removed from both bridges.

Inspections by the Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works, Sir Joseph Bazalgette, following the purchase found that Battersea Bridge was in such poor condition that it was unable to be repaired safely. In 1883 it was restricted to pedestrian traffic only, and in 1885 it was demolished to make way for a new bridge designed by Bazalgette.

The contract to build the new bridge was awarded to John Mowlem &amp; Co, and in June 1887 the Duke of Clarence laid a ceremonial foundation stone in the southern abutment and construction work began. Bazalgette&#x27;s design incorporated five arches with cast iron griders, on granite piers which in turn rest on concrete foundations. The roadway itself is wide, and wide footpaths are cantilevered on either side of the bridge, giving the bridge a total width of . The balustrade is a distinctive Moorish-style lattice. Construction work was overseen by Bazalgette&#x27;s son Edward, and cost a total of £143,000 (about £ in 2025).

On 21 July 1890, the bridge was officially opened by future Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, then chairman of the newly formed London County Council. Unlike its predecessor, the new bridge was officially named Battersea Bridge. Although the road was narrow, trams operated on it from the outset. Initially these were horse-drawn, but from 22 June 1911 the electric trams of London County Council Tramways were introduced.

=== Collisions ===

Although the five spans of the current bridge are far wider than the nineteen spans of the original bridge, Battersea Bridge&#x27;s location on a sharp bend in the river still presents a hazard to navigation. In 1948, the &quot;MV Delta&quot; jammed under the bridge, and its master Hendrikus Oostring suffered broken arms and needed to be rescued from the smashed wheelhouse. On 23 March 1950, the collier &quot;John Hopkinson&quot; collided with the central pier, causing serious structural damage, leaving the tram tracks as the only element holding the bridge together. The London County Council was concerned that the entire structure would collapse and closed the bridge until January 1951. Tram services in the area were withdrawn on 30 September 1950, so when the bridge was reopened the tram tracks were lifted. Another serious incident took place on 21 September 2005, when the &quot;James Prior&quot;, a 200-ton barge, collided with the bridge, causing serious structural damage costing over £500,000 to repair. The bridge was closed to all motor vehicles other than buses while repairs were carried out, causing severe traffic congestion; it eventually reopened on 16 January 2006. Brian King, the master of the &quot;James Prior&quot;, was formally cleared of navigating without due care and attention in 2008, when the judge in the case injured his back and was unable to proceed, and prosecutors decided not to re-present the case.

=== Restoration ===

At only wide, Bazalgette&#x27;s bridge is now London&#x27;s narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames, and in 2004 was the fifth least-used Thames bridge in London. In 1983 the bridge was designated a Grade II listed structure, protecting its character from further alterations, and in 1992 English Heritage oversaw a project to renovate the bridge, which for some years had been painted blue and red.

Paint samples were analysed and photographs from the time of opening consulted, and the bridge was restored to its original appearance. The main body of the bridge was painted in dark green, with the spandrels decorated in gilding. The lamp standards, which had been removed during the Second World War, were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts at the ends of the bridge. A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected at the north end of the bridge in 2005.

=== 2006 Thames whale ===

Shortly after its reopening following the collision with the &quot;James Prior&quot;, the bridge briefly attained national prominence on 20 January 2006 when a long female bottlenose whale became stranded at Battersea Bridge. A rescue operation was mounted, and large crowds flocked to the bridge. The whale was successfully transferred to a barge, but died while being transported back to the sea to be released. A year after the whale&#x27;s death, its skeleton was put on public display in the offices of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. Today it resides at the Natural History Museum.

<text>Walter Hamor Piston, Jr. (January 20, 1894 – November 12, 1976), was an American composer of classical music, music theorist, and professor of music at Harvard University.
==Life==
Piston was born in Rockland, Maine at 15 Ocean Street to Walter Hamor Piston, a bookkeeper, and Leona Stover. He was the second of four children. His paternal grandfather was a sailor named Antonio Pistone, who changed his name to Anthony Piston when he came to Maine from Genoa, Italy. In 1905 the composer&#x27;s father, Walter Piston Sr, moved with his family to Boston, Massachusetts.

Walter Jr first trained as an engineer at the Mechanical Arts High School in Boston, but was artistically inclined. After graduating in 1912, he enrolled in the Massachusetts Normal Art School, where he completed a four-year program in fine art in 1916.

During the 1910s, Piston made a living playing piano and violin in dance bands and later playing violin in orchestras led by Georges Longy. During World War I, he joined the U.S. Navy as a band musician after rapidly teaching himself to play saxophone; he later stated that, when &quot;it became obvious that everybody had to go into the service, I wanted to go in as a musician&quot;. While playing in a service band, he taught himself to play most wind instruments. &quot;They were just lying around,&quot; he later observed, &quot;and no one minded if you picked them up and found out what they could do&quot;.

Piston was admitted to Harvard College in 1920, where he studied counterpoint with Archibald Davison, canon and fugue with Clifford Heilman, advanced harmony with Edward Ballantine, and composition and music history with Edward Burlingame Hill. He often worked as an assistant for various music professors there, and conducted the student orchestra.

In 1920, Piston married artist Kathryn Nason (1892–1976), who had been a fellow student at the Normal Art School. The marriage lasted until her death in February 1976, a few months before his own.

On graduating summa cum laude from Harvard, Piston was awarded a John Knowles Paine Traveling Fellowship. He chose to go to Paris, living there from 1924 to 1926. At the Ecole Nationale de Musique in Paris, he studied composition and counterpoint with Nadia Boulanger, composition with Paul Dukas and violin with George Enescu. His &quot;Three Pieces for Flute, Clarinet and Bassoon&quot; of 1925 was his first published score.

He taught at Harvard from 1926 until his retirement in 1960. His students include Samuel Adler, Leroy Anderson, Arthur Berger, Leonard Bernstein, Gordon Binkerd, Elliott Carter, John Davison, Irving Fine, John Harbison, Karl Kohn, Ellis B. Kohs, Gail Kubik, Billy Jim Layton, Noël Lee, Robert Middleton, Robert Moevs, Daniel Pinkham, Mildred Barnes Royse, Frederic Rzewski, Allen Sapp, Harold Shapero, and Claudio Spies, as well as Frank D&#x27;Accone, Ann Ronell, Robert Strassburg, Yehudi Wyner, and William P. Perry. 

In 1936, the Columbia Broadcasting System commissioned six American composers (Aaron Copland, Louis Gruenberg, Howard Hanson, Roy Harris, William Grant Still and Piston) to write works for broadcast on CBS radio. Piston wrote his Symphony No. 1 and conducted its premiere with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on April 8, 1938.

Piston&#x27;s only dance work, &quot;The Incredible Flutist&quot;, was written for the Boston Pops Orchestra, which premiered it with Arthur Fiedler conducting on May 30, 1938. The dancers were Hans Weiner and his company. Soon after, Piston arranged a concert suite including &quot;a selection of the best parts of the ballet.&quot; This version was premiered by Fritz Reiner and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra on November 22, 1940. Leonard Slatkin and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra included the suite in a 1991 RCA Victor CD recording that also featured Piston&#x27;s &quot;Three New England Sketches&quot; and Symphony No. 6.

Piston studied the twelve-tone technique of Arnold Schoenberg and wrote works using aspects of it as early as the Sonata for Flute and Piano (1930) and the First Symphony (1937). His first fully twelve-tone work was the &quot;Chromatic Study on the Name of Bach&quot; for organ (1940), which nonetheless retains a vague feeling of key. Although he employed twelve-tone elements sporadically throughout his career, these become much more pervasive in the Eighth Symphony (1965) and many of the works following it: the Variations for Cello and Orchestra (1966), Clarinet Concerto (1967), &quot;Ricercare for Orchestra&quot;, Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra (1970), and Flute Concerto (1971).

In 1943, the Alice M. Ditson Fund of Columbia University commissioned Piston&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, which was premiered by the National Symphony Orchestra on March 5, 1944 and was awarded a prize by the New York Music Critics&#x27; Circle. His next symphony, the Third, earned a Pulitzer Prize, as did his Symphony No. 7. His Viola Concerto and String Quartet No. 5 also later received Critics&#x27; Circle awards.

Piston was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal for his outstanding contribution to the arts by the MacDowell Colony in 1974.

Piston wrote four books on the technical aspects of music theory which are considered to be classics in their respective fields: &quot;Principles of Harmonic Analysis&quot;, &quot;Counterpoint&quot;, &quot;Orchestration,&quot; and &quot;Harmony&quot;. The last of these introduced for the first time in theoretical literature several important new concepts that Piston had developed in his approach to music theory, notably the concept of harmonic rhythm, and the secondary dominant. This work went through four editions in the author&#x27;s lifetime, was translated into several languages, and (with changes and additions by Mark DeVoto) was still regarded as recently as 2009 as a standard harmony text.

He died at his home in Belmont, Massachusetts on November 12, 1976.

His library and desk are permanently exhibited in the Piston Room, at the Boston Public Library.

<doc id="351767" wikidata="Q7814330" url="?curid=351767" title="Toll bridge">
<text>A toll bridge is a bridge where a monetary charge (or &quot;toll&quot;) is required to pass over. Generally the private or public owner, builder and maintainer of the bridge uses the toll to recoup their investment, in much the same way as a toll road.

== History ==
The practice of collecting tolls on bridges harks back to the days of ferry crossings where people paid a fee to be ferried across stretches of water. As boats became impractical to carry large loads, ferry operators looked for new sources of revenue. Having built a bridge, they hoped to recoup their investment by charging tolls for people, animals, vehicles, and goods to cross it.

The original London Bridge across the river Thames opened as a toll bridge, but an accumulation of funds by the charitable trust that operated the bridge (Bridge House Estates) saw that the charges were dropped. Using interest on its capital assets, the trust now owns and runs all seven central London bridges at no cost to taxpayers or users.

In the United States, private ownership of toll bridges peaked in the mid-19th century, and by the turn of the 20th century most toll bridges were taken over by state highway departments. In some instances, a quasi-governmental authority was formed, and toll revenue bonds were issued to raise funds for construction or operation (or both) of the facility.

Peters and Kramer observed that &quot;little research has been done to quantify the impact of toll collection on society as a whole&quot; and therefore they published a comprehensive analysis of the Total Societal Cost (TSC) associated with toll collection as a means of taxation. TSC is the sum of administrative, compliance, fuel and pollution costs. In 2000 they estimated it to be $56,914,732, or 37.3% of revenue collected. They also found that a user of a toll road is subject to a form of triple taxation, and that toll collection is a very inefficient means of funding the development of highway infrastructure. Nakamura and Kockelman (2002) show that tolls are by nature regressive, shifting the burden of taxation disproportionately to the poor and middle classes.

Electronic toll collection, branded under names such as EZ-Pass, SunPass, IPass, FasTrak, Treo, GoodToGo, and 407ETR, became increasingly prevalent to metropolitan areas in the 21st century. Amy Finkelstien, a public finance economist at MIT, reports that as the fraction of drivers using electronic toll collection increased, typically toll rates increased as well, because people were less aware of how much they were paying in tolls.

Electronic tolling proposals that represented the shadow price of electronic toll collection (instead of the TSC) may have misled decision-makers. The general public has additionally endured an increased administrative burden associated with paying toll bills and navigating toll collection company on-line billing systems. Additionally, visitors to a region may incur e-toll tag fees imposed by their rental car company. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 identified and attempted to address a similar problem associated with the government collection of information. Approvals were to be secured by government agencies before promulgating a paper form, website, survey or electronic submission that will impose an information collection burden on the general public. However, the act did not anticipate and thus address the burden on the public associated with funding infrastructure via electronic toll collection instead of through more traditional forms of taxation.

== Removal and continuation of tolls ==

In some instances, tolls have been removed after retirement of the toll revenue bonds issued to raise funds. Examples include the Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge in Richmond, Virginia which carries U.S. Route 1 across the James River, and the 4.5-mile long James River Bridge 80 miles downstream which carries U.S. Highway 17 across the river of the same name near its mouth at Hampton Roads. In other cases, especially major facilities such as the Chesapeake Bay Bridge near Annapolis, Maryland, and the George Washington Bridge over Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey, the continued collection of tolls provides a dedicated source of funds for ongoing maintenance and improvements.

Sometimes citizens revolt against toll plazas, as was the case in Jacksonville, Florida. Tolls were in place on four bridges crossing the St. Johns River, including I-95. These tolls paid for the respective bridges as well as many other highway projects. As Jacksonville continued to grow, the tolls created bottlenecks on the roadway. In 1988, Jacksonville voters chose to eliminate all the toll booths and replace the revenue with a ½ cent sales tax increase. In 1989, the toll booths were removed, 36 years after the first toll booth went up.

In Scotland, the Scottish Parliament purchased the Skye Bridge from its owners in late 2004, ending the requirement to pay an unpopular expensive toll to cross to Skye from the mainland.

In 2004, the German government cancelled a contract with the &quot;Toll Collect&quot; syndicate after much negative publicity. The term &quot;Toll Collect&quot; became a popular byword among Germans used to describe everything wrong with their national economy.

== Toll collection ==
It has become increasingly common for a toll bridge to only charge a fee in one direction. This helps reduce the traffic congestion in the other direction, and generally does not significantly reduce revenue, especially when those travelling the one direction are forced to come back over the same or a different toll bridge.

== Toll avoidance: shunpiking ==
A practice known as shunpiking evolved which entails finding another route for the specific purpose of avoiding payment of tolls.

In some situations where the tolls were increased or felt to be unreasonably high, informal shunpiking by individuals escalated into a form of boycott by regular users, with the goal of applying the financial stress of lost toll revenue to the authority determining the levy.

One such example of shunpiking as a form of boycott occurred at the James River Bridge in eastern Virginia. After years of lower-than-anticipated revenues on the narrow privately funded structure built in 1928, the state of Virginia finally purchased the facility in 1949 and increased the tolls in 1955 without visibly improving the roadway, with the notable exception of a new toll plaza. The increased toll rates incensed the public and business users alike. Joseph W. Luter Jr., head of Smithfield Packing Company, the producer of Smithfield Hams, ordered his truck drivers to take a different route and cross a smaller and cheaper bridge. Tolls continued for 20 more years, and were finally removed from the old bridge in 1976.

<text>In graph theory, the Robertson–Seymour theorem (also called the graph minor theorem) states that the undirected graphs, partially ordered by the graph minor relationship, form a well-quasi-ordering. Equivalently, every family of graphs that is closed under minors can be defined by a finite set of forbidden minors, in the same way that Wagner&#x27;s theorem characterizes the planar graphs as being the graphs that do not have the complete graph &quot;K&quot;5 or the complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;3,3 as minors.

The Robertson–Seymour theorem is named after mathematicians Neil Robertson and Paul D. Seymour, who proved it in a series of twenty papers spanning over 500 pages from 1983 to 2004. Before its proof, the statement of the theorem was known as Wagner&#x27;s conjecture after the German mathematician Klaus Wagner, although Wagner said he never conjectured it.

A weaker result for trees is implied by Kruskal&#x27;s tree theorem, which was conjectured in 1937 by Andrew Vázsonyi and proved in 1960 independently by Joseph Kruskal and S. Tarkowski.

==Statement==
A minor of an undirected graph &quot;G&quot; is any graph that may be obtained from &quot;G&quot; by a sequence of zero or more contractions of edges of &quot;G&quot; and deletions of edges and vertices of &quot;G&quot;. The minor relationship forms a partial order on the set of all distinct finite undirected graphs, as it obeys the three axioms of partial orders: it is reflexive (every graph is a minor of itself), transitive (a minor of a minor of &quot;G&quot; is itself a minor of &quot;G&quot;), and antisymmetric (if two graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are minors of each other, then they must be isomorphic). However, if graphs that are isomorphic may nonetheless be considered as distinct objects, then the minor ordering on graphs forms a preorder, a relation that is reflexive and transitive but not necessarily antisymmetric.

A preorder is said to form a well-quasi-ordering if it contains neither an infinite descending chain nor an infinite antichain. For instance, the usual ordering on the non-negative integers is a well-quasi-ordering, but the same ordering on the set of all integers is not, because it contains the infinite descending chain 0, −1, −2, −3... Another example is the set of positive integers ordered by divisibility, which has no infinite descending chains, but where the prime numbers constitute an infinite antichain.

The Robertson–Seymour theorem states that finite undirected graphs and graph minors form a well-quasi-ordering. The graph minor relationship does not contain any infinite descending chain, because each contraction or deletion reduces the number of edges and vertices of the graph (a non-negative integer). The nontrivial part of the theorem is that there are no infinite antichains, infinite sets of graphs that are all unrelated to each other by the minor ordering. If &quot;S&quot; is a set of graphs, and &quot;M&quot; is a subset of &quot;S&quot; containing one representative graph for each equivalence class of minimal elements (graphs that belong to &quot;S&quot; but for which no proper minor belongs to &quot;S&quot;), then &quot;M&quot; forms an antichain; therefore, an equivalent way of stating the theorem is that, in any infinite set &quot;S&quot; of graphs, there must be only a finite number of non-isomorphic minimal elements.

Another equivalent form of the theorem is that, in any infinite set &quot;S&quot; of graphs, there must be a pair of graphs one of which is a minor of the other. The statement that every infinite set has finitely many minimal elements implies this form of the theorem, for if there are only finitely many minimal elements, then each of the remaining graphs must belong to a pair of this type with one of the minimal elements. And in the other direction, this form of the theorem implies the statement that there can be no infinite antichains, because an infinite antichain is a set that does not contain any pair related by the minor relation.

==Forbidden minor characterizations==

A family &quot;F&quot; of graphs is said to be closed under the operation of taking minors if every minor of a graph in &quot;F&quot; also belongs to &quot;F&quot;. If &quot;F&quot; is a minor-closed family, then let &quot;S&quot; be the class of graphs that are not in &quot;F&quot; (the complement of &quot;F&quot;). According to the Robertson–Seymour theorem, there exists a finite set &quot;H&quot; of minimal elements in &quot;S&quot;. These minimal elements form a forbidden graph characterization of &quot;F&quot;: the graphs in &quot;F&quot; are exactly the graphs that do not have any graph in &quot;H&quot; as a minor. The members of &quot;H&quot; are called the excluded minors (or forbidden minors, or minor-minimal obstructions) for the family &quot;F&quot;.

For example, the planar graphs are closed under taking minors: contracting an edge in a planar graph, or removing edges or vertices from the graph, cannot destroy its planarity. Therefore, the planar graphs have a forbidden minor characterization, which in this case is given by Wagner&#x27;s theorem: the set &quot;H&quot; of minor-minimal nonplanar graphs contains exactly two graphs, the complete graph &quot;K&quot;5 and the complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;3,3, and the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that do not have a minor in the set {&quot;K&quot;5, &quot;K&quot;3,3}.

The existence of forbidden minor characterizations for all minor-closed graph families is an equivalent way of stating the Robertson–Seymour theorem. For, suppose that every minor-closed family &quot;F&quot; has a finite set &quot;H&quot; of minimal forbidden minors, and let &quot;S&quot; be any infinite set of graphs. Define &quot;F&quot; from &quot;S&quot; as the family of graphs that do not have a minor in &quot;S&quot;. Then &quot;F&quot; is minor-closed and has a finite set &quot;H&quot; of minimal forbidden minors. Let &quot;C&quot; be the complement of &quot;F&quot;. &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;C&quot; since &quot;S&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are disjoint, and &quot;H&quot; are the minimal graphs in &quot;C&quot;. Consider a graph &quot;G&quot; in &quot;H&quot;. &quot;G&quot; cannot have a proper minor in &quot;S&quot; since &quot;G&quot; is minimal in &quot;C&quot;. At the same time, &quot;G&quot; must have a minor in &quot;S&quot;, since otherwise &quot;G&quot; would be an element in &quot;F&quot;. Therefore, &quot;G&quot; is an element in &quot;S&quot;, i.e., &quot;H&quot; is a subset of &quot;S&quot;, and all other graphs in &quot;S&quot; have a minor among the graphs in &quot;H&quot;, so &quot;H&quot; is the finite set of minimal elements of &quot;S&quot;.

For the other implication, assume that every set of graphs has a finite subset of minimal graphs and let a minor-closed set &quot;F&quot; be given. We want to find a set &quot;H&quot; of graphs such that a graph is in &quot;F&quot; if and only if it does not have a minor in &quot;H&quot;. Let &quot;E&quot; be the graphs which are not minors of any graph in &quot;F&quot;, and let &quot;H&quot; be the finite set of minimal graphs in &quot;E&quot;. Now, let an arbitrary graph &quot;G&quot; be given. Assume first that &quot;G&quot; is in &quot;F&quot;. &quot;G&quot; cannot have a minor in &quot;H&quot; since &quot;G&quot; is in &quot;F&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is a subset of &quot;E&quot;. Now assume that &quot;G&quot; is not in &quot;F&quot;. Then &quot;G&quot; is not a minor of any graph in &quot;F&quot;, since &quot;F&quot; is minor-closed. Therefore, &quot;G&quot; is in &quot;E&quot;, so &quot;G&quot; has a minor in &quot;H&quot;.

==Examples of minor-closed families==
The following sets of finite graphs are minor-closed, and therefore (by the Robertson–Seymour theorem) have forbidden minor characterizations:
*forests, linear forests (disjoint unions of path graphs), pseudoforests, and cactus graphs;
*planar graphs, outerplanar graphs, apex graphs (formed by adding a single vertex to a planar graph), toroidal graphs, and the graphs that can be embedded on any fixed two-dimensional manifold;
*graphs that are linklessly embeddable in Euclidean 3-space, and graphs that are knotlessly embeddable in Euclidean 3-space;
*graphs with a feedback vertex set of size bounded by some fixed constant; graphs with Colin de Verdière graph invariant bounded by some fixed constant; graphs with treewidth, pathwidth, or branchwidth bounded by some fixed constant.

==Obstruction sets==

Some examples of finite obstruction sets were already known for specific classes of graphs before the Robertson–Seymour theorem was proved. For example, the obstruction for the set of all forests is the loop graph (or, if one restricts to simple graphs, the cycle with three vertices). This means that a graph is a forest if and only if none of its minors is the loop (or, the cycle with three vertices, respectively). The sole obstruction for the set of paths is the tree with four vertices, one of which has degree 3. In these cases, the obstruction set contains a single element, but in general this is not the case. Wagner&#x27;s theorem states that a graph is planar if and only if it has neither &quot;K&quot;5 nor &quot;K&quot;3,3 as a minor. In other words, the set {&quot;K&quot;5, &quot;K&quot;3,3} is an obstruction set for the set of all planar graphs, and in fact the unique minimal obstruction set. A similar theorem states that &quot;K&quot;4 and &quot;K&quot;2,3 are the forbidden minors for the set of outerplanar graphs.

Although the Robertson–Seymour theorem extends these results to arbitrary minor-closed graph families, it is not a complete substitute for these results, because it does not provide an explicit description of the obstruction set for any family. For example, it tells us that the set of toroidal graphs has a finite obstruction set, but it does not provide any such set. The complete set of forbidden minors for toroidal graphs remains unknown, but it contains at least 17,535 graphs.

==Polynomial time recognition==
The Robertson–Seymour theorem has an important consequence in computational complexity, due to the proof by Robertson and Seymour that, for each fixed graph &quot;h&quot;, there is a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a graph has &quot;h&quot; as a minor. This algorithm&#x27;s running time is cubic (in the size of the graph to check), though with a constant factor that depends superpolynomially on the size of the minor &quot;h&quot;. The running time has been improved to quadratic by Kawarabayashi, Kobayashi, and Reed. As a result, for every minor-closed family &quot;F&quot;, there is polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a graph belongs to &quot;F&quot;: simply check whether the given graph contains &quot;h&quot; for each forbidden minor &quot;h&quot; in &quot;F&quot;’s obstruction set.

However, this method requires a specific finite obstruction set to work, and the theorem does not provide one. The theorem proves that such a finite obstruction set exists, and therefore the problem is polynomial because of the above algorithm. However, the algorithm can be used in practice only if such a finite obstruction set is provided. As a result, the theorem proves that the problem can be solved in polynomial time, but does not provide a concrete polynomial-time algorithm for solving it. Such proofs of polynomiality are non-constructive: they prove polynomiality of problems without providing an explicit polynomial-time algorithm. In many specific cases, checking whether a graph is in a given minor-closed family can be done more efficiently: for example, checking whether a graph is planar can be done in linear time.

==Fixed-parameter tractability==
For graph invariants with the property that, for each &quot;k&quot;, the graphs with invariant at most &quot;k&quot; are minor-closed, the same method applies. For instance, by this result, treewidth, branchwidth, and pathwidth, vertex cover, and the minimum genus of an embedding are all amenable to this approach, and for any fixed &quot;k&quot; there is a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether these invariants are at most &quot;k&quot;, in which the exponent in the running time of the algorithm does not depend on &quot;k&quot;. A problem with this property, that it can be solved in polynomial time for any fixed &quot;k&quot; with an exponent that does not depend on &quot;k&quot;, is known as fixed-parameter tractable.

However, this method does not directly provide a single fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for computing the parameter value for a given graph with unknown &quot;k&quot;, because of the difficulty of determining the set of forbidden minors. Additionally, the large constant factors involved in these results make them highly impractical. Therefore, the development of explicit fixed-parameter algorithms for these problems, with improved dependence on &quot;k&quot;, has continued to be an important line of research.

==Finite form of the graph minor theorem==
 showed that the following theorem exhibits the independence phenomenon by being &quot;unprovable&quot; in various formal systems that are much stronger than Peano arithmetic, yet being &quot;provable&quot; in systems much weaker than ZFC:
:Theorem: For every positive integer &quot;n&quot;, there is an integer &quot;m&quot; so large that if &quot;G&quot;1, ..., &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot; is a sequence of finite undirected graphs, 
:where each &quot;G&quot;&quot;i&quot; has size at most &quot;n&quot;+&quot;i&quot;, then &quot;G&quot;&quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;G&quot;&quot;k&quot; for some &quot;j&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot;.

(Here, the &quot;size&quot; of a graph is the total number of its vertices and edges, and ≤ denotes the minor ordering.)

<text>Richard Vincent &quot;Rick&quot; Mercer (born October 17, 1969) is a Canadian comedian, television personality, political satirist, and author. He is best known for his work on the CBC Television comedy shows &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;. He is the author of four books based on content from the shows and the two part memoir consisting of &quot;Talking to Canadians&quot; (November 2021) and &quot;The Road Years&quot; (October 2023). Mercer has received more than 25 Gemini Awards for his work on television.

==Career==

===Early work===
Mercer first came to national attention in 1990 when he created and presented his one-man stage show &quot;Show Me the Button: I&#x27;ll Push It (or Charles Lynch Must Die)&quot; at the National Arts Centre&#x27;s Atelier in Ottawa. A satirical political commentary on Canadian life after Meech Lake, &quot;Show Me the Button&quot; made Mercer a national star as he toured the show across Canada. In 1992, he created and performed his second stage show, &quot;I&#x27;ve Killed Before, I&#x27;ll Kill Again&quot; at the National Arts Centre&#x27;s Studio Theatre, which also became a popular touring show.

===&quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;===
In 1992, he began to work with former &quot;CODCO&quot; members Cathy Jones and Mary Walsh, and fellow Newfoundlander Greg Thomey, to create a new television series for CBC Television which became &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. In the first eight seasons of &quot;22 Minutes&quot;, Mercer provided some of the show&#x27;s signature moments, including an Internet petition (on the &quot; 22 Minutes&quot; website) to force Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day to change his first name to Doris. The website used for the petition was later repurposed as a way to have Canadians send Christmas cards to peacekeepers in Bosnia. Mercer hand delivered these to the troops in a December 2000 special. In 2001, following an incident in which an aide to federal member of Parliament (MP) Rahim Jaffer posed as the politician in a radio interview, Mercer performed a parody rap based on Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, with the lyrics &quot;Will the real Rahim Jaffer please stand up?

Mercer&#x27;s two-minute &quot;rants&quot;, in which he would speak directly to the camera about a current political issue, shot in a style similar to those Denis Leary used in MTV commercials, quickly became the show&#x27;s signature segment. In 1998, he published a book, &quot;Streeters&quot;, which compiled many of his most famous &quot;22 Minutes&quot; rants. It became a national bestseller. In 2007 he published his second book, &quot;Rick Mercer Report: The Book&quot;.

In November 2010, Mercer contributed a rant he had previously recorded in 2007 on the subject of the bullying of gay and lesbian teens in high schools to Dan Savage&#x27;s It Gets Better Project.

====&quot;Talking to Americans&quot;====

One of Mercer&#x27;s comedy routines on &quot;22 Minutes&quot; was &quot;Talking to Americans&quot;, in which he would travel to a major American city or institution and conduct on-the-street interviews with Americans on topics such as Canadian politics and weather, using the subject&#x27;s ignorance about Canada for comedic effect. One famous example saw Mercer asking Americans&#x27; opinion on whether Canada should change its &quot;20 Hour Clock&quot; to the 24-hour one used by the United States. He received approval from citizens and from the Governor of Iowa, Tom Vilsack. On another occasion he got the support of Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee in calling on Canadians to save the &quot;National Igloo&quot;.

Mercer made international headlines in 2000 when he pulled a &quot;Talking to Americans&quot; stunt on then-presidential candidate George W. Bush. He successfully got Bush to answer questions about non-existent Canadian Prime Minister &quot;Jean Poutine&quot;. Bush was not amused at the time, but he did make a joking reference to this incident during his visit to Canada in 2004. In the same US election campaign, Mercer asked Democratic candidate Al Gore to promise to visit the &quot;Canadian capital city&quot; of Toronto after his election. Gore did not question Mercer&#x27;s incorrect identification of the capital of Canada.

In 2001, Mercer co-produced a CBC special based on &quot;Talking to Americans&quot;, which attracted 2.7 million Canadian viewers—the highest-rated television special in Canadian history. Later, the respected ABC News program &quot;Nightline&quot; would devote a show to it. This was his last major project related to &quot;22 Minutes&quot;—at the end of the 2000–2001 season, he announced his departure from that show to focus on his other television show, &quot;Made in Canada&quot;. &quot;Talking to Americans&quot; was nominated for a Gemini Award, but following the 9/11 attacks, Mercer declined the nomination.

===&quot;Made in Canada&quot;===

Mercer co-created the series &quot;Made in Canada&quot;, which ran for five seasons on CBC Television from 1998 to 2003. The show was a fast-paced situation comedy which self-referentially satirized the Canadian TV production industry, often drawing from details of its own production companies and including thinly veiled parodies of contemporary programs. It was syndicated abroad as &quot;The Industry&quot; and won several Gemini Awards (which were themselves satirized in subsequent episodes).

===&quot;The Rick Mercer Report&quot;===

In 2003, &quot;Made in Canada&quot; ended its run, and Mercer began to work on a new CBC series, &quot;Rick Mercer&#x27;s Monday Report&quot;. Similar in format to &quot;22 Minutes&quot; and &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, the show debuted in January 2004. Also in 2003, Mercer went to Afghanistan to visit the Canadian troops stationed there, resulting in the television special &quot;Christmas in Kabul&quot;.

Despite reports of a long-standing feud Mercer invited Walsh to appear on &quot;Monday Report&quot; as a special guest to promote her own series &quot;Hatching, Matching and Dispatching&quot;.

At the end of its second season, &quot;Monday Report&quot; was the highest rated arts and entertainment show on the CBC. Former Prime Minister Paul Martin gave him a private tour of 24 Sussex Drive and former New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent made snow angels with Mercer on Parliament Hill. Other prominent guests were NDP leader Jack Layton (who was Mercer&#x27;s own MP); Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper (former Prime Minister); Green Party leader Elizabeth May; then-Conservative MP Belinda Stronach; Conservative MP Peter MacKay; former Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams; Olympic gold medallist Kyle Shewfelt; author Pierre Berton; recording artists Jann Arden, Bif Naked, Rush, bassist Geddy Lee, drummer and lyricist Neil Peart, and Sarah McLachlan; publishing mogul Conrad Black; and former prime minister Jean Chrétien. When Mercer hosted a relief benefit concert for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami at the Pengrowth Saddledome in Calgary, musical guests Barenaked Ladies appeared in a segment Mercer shot backstage completely naked.

In 2005, the CBC moved &quot;Monday Report&quot; to Tuesday nights, which caused the show&#x27;s name to be changed to &quot;The Rick Mercer Report&quot;. On his blog, Mercer wrote of the time slot shift that &quot;we ended the season as the highest rated comedy show on the network. Clearly some drastic changes were needed.&quot;

In 2017, it was announced that the &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot; would end production after its 15th season; the last episode aired on April 10, 2018.

===Other film and television work===
Mercer has hosted &quot;It Seems Like Yesterday&quot;, which examines pop-culture from the 1950s to the 1980s. He has appeared in a few films, including &quot;Secret Nation&quot;, &quot;Understanding Bliss&quot;, &quot;How to Be Deadly&quot; and &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot;.

In late 2014, he guest starred in the second to last episode of the Republic of Doyle television series.

In 2022, he launched &quot;Comedy Night with Rick Mercer&quot;, a CBC Television series showcasing stand-up comedy performances by emerging Canadian comedians.

==Books==
A book by Mercer, &quot;Rick Mercer Report: The Book&quot;, based on his television program, was published on September 25, 2007, by Doubleday Canada. This was Mercer&#x27;s first book since &quot;Streeters&quot; of 1998, and contained a collection of Mercer&#x27;s rants from the first four seasons of &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;, together with moments from interviews for the program and other writings by Mercer. On CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot; on September 21, Shelagh Rogers said of the book that &quot;it&#x27;s the most fun I&#x27;ve had in bed in a long time.&quot; The book entered the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; books chart on October 6 at number three. It was number one in the &quot;Globe&quot; bestseller list in the week before Christmas 2007, and reprinted eight times.

An expanded and updated paperback version of &quot;Rick Mercer Report: The Book&quot;, called &quot;Rick Mercer Report: The Paperback Book&quot;, was published by Anchor Canada on September 16, 2008, and immediately entered the top ten of the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; bestseller list. It has been reprinted several times.

Mercer&#x27;s next book, &quot;A Nation Worth Ranting About&quot;, was published by Doubleday Canada on September 18, 2012. It was also a bestseller.

&quot;Rick Mercer Final Report&quot; was published by Doubleday Canada in 2018.

&quot;Talking to Canadians: A Memoir&quot; was published by Doubleday Canada on November 2, 2021.

&quot;The Road Years: A Memoir Continued&quot; was published by Doubleday Canada on October 31, 2023.

==Awards==
Mercer has received more than 25 Gemini Awards for his television work. He has also won the Sir Peter Ustinov Comedy Award, presented to him at the 2003 Banff Television Festival. In 1993, Newfoundland premier Clyde Wells honoured Mercer with the Newfoundland Arts Council&#x27;s Artist of the Year award. In 2004, Mercer was presented with the National Arts Centre Award, a companion award of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards. He donated his $15,000 cash prize to the LSPU hall, the theatre in Newfoundland where Mercer performed his early work.

He holds honorary degrees from Laurentian University in Sudbury, Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John&#x27;s, Brock University in St. Catharines, McMaster University in Hamilton, Bishop&#x27;s University in Lennoxville, the University of British Columbia, the University of Guelph, the University of Western Ontario in London, and the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston He received an honorary high school diploma for his outstanding efforts and determination from Landmark East School in Wolfville, Nova Scotia in 1999.

Mercer was awarded the 30th Annual Bob Edwards Award in Calgary.

In 2007, he was named honorary colonel of the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s 423 Maritime Helicopter Squadron, based at CFB Shearwater in Shearwater, Nova Scotia.

On June 30, 2014, Mercer was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada by David Johnston, Governor General of Canada, for &quot;his ability to inspire and challenge Canadians through humour&quot; and his work with charitable causes. He was formally invested into the Order in a ceremony at Rideau Hall on September 23, 2015. The same year, he was inducted into the Canadian Disability Hall of Fame. In 2019, Mercer received the Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award as part of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards.

His memoir &quot;Talking to Canadians&quot; was the winner of the 2022 Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour.

In 2023, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Spokesperson and endorsements==
Mercer is co-chair, along with Belinda Stronach, in the Spread the Net campaign, partnered through UNICEF, which kicked off at Brock University on September 10, 2008. Spread the Net provides bed nets for $10 each to prevent the spread of malaria among children in Africa.

In December 2004, Mercer appeared on the commercials advertising the One-Tonne Challenge for the Government of Canada. Mercer also appeared as a model in a national ad for men&#x27;s clothing store, Harry Rosen, wearing a Canali suit. All of Mercer&#x27;s fees for the campaign went to Casey House, a hospice in Toronto for people living with AIDS. Casey House was founded by June Callwood, who appeared as a celebrity guest on &quot;Monday Report&quot;.

In September 2005, Mercer became the national spokesperson for the 2005 Walk For Life, a series of 132 fund-raising walks across Canada that raise money for people living with HIV and AIDS. The Walk for Life is a project of the Canadian AIDS Society.

Mercer has narrated an animated science video on climate change for Science North in Sudbury.

In November 2010, Mercer joined the It Gets Better campaign, a series of videos that aim to help gay and lesbian youth overcome bullying.

Since 2011, Mercer has been honorary patron of Hope Air, a charity that provides free non-emergency medical flights for people in financial need.

==Personal life==
Mercer was born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and raised in Middle Cove. His mother, Patricia Cook, is a nurse and his father, Kenneth Mercer, is an executive in the fisheries ministry. Growing up he attended Macdonald Drive Elementary and dropped out of Prince of Wales Collegiate in St. John&#x27;s before completing his diploma requirements. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets during his teen years.

Mercer&#x27;s spouse since 1990 is television producer Gerald Lunz. Although the romantic relationship came first, Lunz is also Mercer&#x27;s long-time partner in business, who discovered him, fostered his career, and was the executive producer of &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;. He regards his personal life as private and says little about it in public beyond acknowledging that he is gay; in a 2011 interview on CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;The Current&quot;, he clarified that he tries &quot;to live [his] life as an out gay man&quot; but doesn&#x27;t specifically mention his sexuality on &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot; because it&#x27;s just &quot;not what the show is about&quot;.

<text>The Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRCNA or CRC) is a Protestant Calvinist Christian denomination in the United States and Canada. Having roots in the Dutch Reformed Church of the Netherlands, the Christian Reformed Church was founded by Dutch immigrants in 1857 and is theologically Calvinist.

==History==

The Christian Reformed Church (CRC) split from the Reformed Church in America (then known as the Dutch Reformed Church) in an 1857 secession. This was rooted in part as a result of a theological dispute that originated in the Netherlands in which Hendrik De Cock was deposed for his Calvinist convictions, leading there to the Secession of 1834–35. For the CRC founders in America, the RCA then appeared to contain problems similar to those that they had seen in the State Church in the old country. Gijsbert Haan (January 3, 1801 – July 27, 1874) was the leader in the 1857 Secession of Dutch-Americans from the Reformed Church in America and the creator of the Christian Reformed Church in the United States and Canada.

In 1857, four churches with about 130 families (about 10 percent of the Dutch immigrant church members in West Michigan at the time) seceded. In March, the Noordeloos church of the Classis of Holland, Michigan, left the Reformed Church in America. On March 19, some members of Second Reformed Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan, organized a church that became First CRC, Grand Rapids, Michigan. On April 8, churches in Graafschap and Polkton also left the Classis of Holland. Two ministers, Koene van den Bosch and Hendrik Klijn, joined the separatists, although Klijn returned to the Reformed Church six months later.

The new denomination that formed from this secession was led by elders and ministers from the churches in the northern Netherlands, especially from the province of Groningen, that had organized after the 1834 secession in the Netherlands, although members of the new denomination came from all parts of the Netherlands. The reasons given for leaving the Reformed Church were the use of hymns (versus Exclusive psalmody) during worship, allowing free access to communion, lax interpretation of grace, permitting membership in Freemasonry, and failure to provide catechetical instruction to young people.

For the two years, the denomination had no corporate name. In 1859, Holland Reformed Church (&quot;Hollandsche Gereformeerde Kerk&quot;) was adopted, which was changed to Free Dutch Reformed Church (no record of a Dutch translation) in 1861. Two years later, True Dutch Reformed Church (&quot;Ware Hollandsche Gereformeerde Kerk&quot;) was approved, which was changed to Holland Christian Reformed Church (&quot;Hollandsche Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk&quot;) in 1880. In 1894 congregations also could use Christian Reformed Church (&quot;Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk&quot;) as well. The full adoption of Christian Reformed Church came in 1904, which became Christian Reformed Church in North America in 1974.

In 1875, the denomination opened a theological school in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Preparatory Department of the school became Calvin College, while the Theological Department became Calvin Theological Seminary. By 1880 the denomination had grown to 42 congregations. Ten years later the number had grown to 100 located in 11 states. During the 1890s congregations from the True Protestant Dutch Reformed Church (located in New York and New Jersey) joined the CRC. During the 20th century a number of congregations from the disbanding German Reformed Churches also joined the CRC.

By 1920, the denomination had grown to 350 congregations. At that time an estimated 350,000 Dutch immigrants had come to the United States, some of whom were in the Dutch Reformed tradition that since the 1880s was influenced by Abraham Kuyper, a Dutch Neo-Calvinist theologian, journalist, and statesman (he served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, 1901-1905). He founded the &quot;Gereformeerde Kerken&quot;, a newspaper, the Free University of Amsterdam, and the Anti-Revolutionary Political Party.

During the early 1920s, the CRC adopted three doctrinal points regarding common grace. Three ministers, Herman Hoeksema, George Ophoff, and Henry Danhof were deposed for rejecting three points as being contrary to the Reformed confessions. The dispute led to the three ministers and their followers leaving the CRC and forming what is now the Protestant Reformed Churches in America.

After the Second World War, a new wave of Dutch Calvinist immigration occurred to Canada, most of which were Kuyperian. By 1960, half of the denomination&#x27;s new congregations (138 of 288) were in Canada.

In the early 1950s, a division within the Protestant Reformed Churches in America led to about three fifths of its members forming the Orthodox Protestant Reformed Church, which joined the CRC in 1961.

==Ecumenical partnerships==
In 1975 the CRC joined the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC), Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA), the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (RPCES) and the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) in forming the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council (NAPARC).

In the last decades of the 20th century, the Synod enacted innovations that were rejected by some of its more conservative members and one-time sister denominations. Out of concern about the state of affairs in the CRC, a group of ministers formed the Mid-America Reformed Seminary in 1981, and around the same time a federation of churches known as the Orthodox Christian Reformed Churches (OCRC), comprising some former CRC congregations, was formed. The 1995 decision to ordain women led to the formation of the United Reformed Churches in North America (URC), and the severing of fraternal relationships between the CRC and the OPC and PCA in 1997. Because of the decision to ordain women, NAPARC suspended the CRC from membership in 1999 and expelled it in 2001. This gradual shift has spurred some of the more conservative congregations to leave; a significant number of these have ended up in the PCA, OPC, or URC. In 2008, the OCRC dissolved and member churches joined the URC.

The CRC was a charter member of the Reformed Ecumenical Council, which organized at Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1946. The CRC joined the World Alliance of Reformed Churches in 2002 after many years of hesitation due to what was seen as the more liberal membership and agenda of that body. In 2010, the Reformed Ecumenical Council and World Alliance of Reformed Churches merged to form the World Communion of Reformed Churches at a joint meeting hosted by the CRC in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The CRC also belongs to the Canadian Council of Churches, the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, the World Reformed Fellowship, and the National Association of Evangelicals. The CRC participates in Christian Churches Together in the United States and in the Global Christian Forum.

As of 2016 the CRC has bilateral relationships with 39 denominations around the globe: 24 are in &quot;ecclesiastical fellowship;&quot; 10 are &quot;in dialogue;&quot; and five are in &quot;corresponding fellowship.&quot; In North America, the CRC is denominational partners with the more mainline Reformed Church in America (from which it had split in 1857) and in ecclesiastical fellowship with the Evangelical Presbyterian Church and .

==Theology==
The Christian Reformed Church is Calvinist, confessional and evangelical in its theology. It places high value on theological study and the application of theology to current issues, emphasizes the importance of careful Biblical hermeneutics, and has traditionally respected the personal conscience of individual members who feel they are led by the Holy Spirit. The Church promotes the belief that Christians do not earn their salvation, but that it is a wholly unmerited gift from God, and that good works are the Christian response to that gift.

Reformed theology as practiced in the CRC is founded in Calvinism. A more recent theologian of great influence on this denomination was Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920). Kuyper, who served as the Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905, promoted a belief in social responsibility and called on Christians to engage actively in improving all aspects of life and society. Kuyper is regarded as a founding father of Christian Democracy political ideology. Current scholars with wider reputations, such as philosophers Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff, as well as Lewis B. Smedes, have associations with this denomination and with Calvin University. Philip Yancey has stated, &quot;I also admire the tradition of the Christian Reformed Church, which advocates &#x27;bringing every thought captive&#x27; under the mind of Christ; that tiny &#x27;transforming&#x27; denomination has had an enormous influence on science, philosophy, and the arts.&quot;

==Doctrinal standards==
The CRC officially subscribes to the Ecumenical Creeds—the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed—as well as three Reformed Confessions, commonly referred as the Three Forms of Unity: the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, and the Canons of Dort.

In 1986, the CRC formulated a statement of faith titled &quot;Our World Belongs to God: A Contemporary Testimony&quot; which addresses issues such as secularism, individualism, and relativism. These issues were seen as &quot;unique challenges of faith presented by the times in which we live&quot;. While not having confessional status, it is meant to give a hymn-like expression of CRC beliefs within the heritage of the Reformed confessions, especially addressing issues that confront the church today. The Contemporary Testimony was reviewed and updated in 2008. The second Contemporary Testimony held by the CRCNA is the Belhar Confession, a testimony written in Afrikaans in 1982 from Reformed churches in South Africa.

==Social issues==
The Christian Reformed Church has stated its position on a number of social issues. Summaries of those positions and references to full reports with exact statements can be found at crcna.org.

The CRC is opposed to abortion except in cases when the &quot;life of the mother is genuinely threatened&quot; by her pregnancy. The church &quot;affirms the unique value of all human life&quot; from the &quot;moment of conception&quot;. Believers are called upon to show &quot;compassion&quot; to those experiencing unwanted pregnancies, even while they speak out against the &quot;atrocity&quot; of abortion. In 2010, the Synod adopted a recommendation &quot;to instruct the Office of Social Justice and Hunger Action (OSJ) to boldly advocate for the church&#x27;s position against abortion, and to help equip churches to promote the sanctity of human life&quot; (Acts of Synod 2010, p. 883).&quot;

Unlike many other Christian denominations, the CRC does not have an official stance on euthanasia. Their Acts of the 1972 Synod, however, can be interpreted as also a condemnation of euthanasia, since it opposes &quot;the wanton or arbitrary destruction of any human being at any stage of its development from the point of conception to the point of death&quot;. (Acts of Synod 1972, p. 64) The CRC already expressed its official opposition to legal euthanasia both in Canada and the United States.

The CRC has a moderate stance on the death penalty: &quot;The CRC has declared that modern states are not obligated by Scripture, creed, or principle to institute and practice capital punishment. It does, however, recognize that Scripture acknowledges the right of modern states to institute and practice capital punishment if it is exercised with utmost restraint.&quot;

The stance of the CRC is that homosexuality is &quot;a condition of disordered sexuality that reflects the brokenness of our sinful world&quot;. Christian homosexuals should not pursue &quot;homosexualism&quot;, defined as &quot;explicit homosexual practice&quot;, which is &quot;incompatible with obedience to the will of God as revealed in Scripture&quot;. Christian homosexuals should be given &quot;loving support&quot; within the church community, compassion, and support &quot;towards healing and wholeness&quot;. Christian homosexuals, like all Christians, are called to discipleship, holy obedience, and the use of their gifts in the cause of the kingdom. Opportunities to serve within the offices and the life of the congregation should be afforded to them as to heterosexual Christians.

The Christian Reformed Church in North America also opposes Freemasonry.

==Political involvement==
The CRC educates its constituency and mobilizes member advocacy on a wide range of social justice issues in Canada and the United States. It does so primarily through its Office of Social Justice and Hunger Action (OSJ) and the Centre for Public Dialogue (CPD) in Canada. Major issues on which the CRC has clear, biblically rooted positions and an active advocacy effort include: Reducing or ending abortion, comprehensive reform of the U.S. immigration system, ending global poverty and hunger, fighting systemic racism in both Canada and the U.S., achieving more justice for aboriginal groups in the U.S. and Canada, organizing for a stronger governmental and private sector response to care for God&#x27;s creation – including climate change, refugee protection and resettlement, and standing in solidarity with those who are persecuted for their faith.

== Missions ==
The CRC has mission efforts and ministries in Nigeria, South America, Southeast Asia, and the Navajo reservation. Among the most prominent reservation churches are the Zuni and Rehoboth missions. Rehoboth was founded in 1903 and has grown significantly into a large church and has an independent school with over 500 students in grades K-12; Zuni has experienced the same in its community. The Rehoboth hospital moved to the neighboring town of Gallup in 1970. Rehoboth built a high-school in 1951, and a new high school, funded by the DeVos family, was built in 2018. The first Rehoboth church was built in 1908, though the congregation moved to a new building in 2005.

==Governance==

Church polity refers to the form of governance and organization of a church. The CRC follows a Presbyterian form of church polity organized under governance by elders, as compared to Episcopal polities organized under governance by bishops (Roman Catholic, United Methodist, and Episcopal denominations) and Congregational polities organized under the governance of the local congregation (Congregational, Baptist, Disciples of Christ). Governance by elders is assumed throughout the Christian Reformed Church Order, but CRC polity is not exactly like that of Presbyterian denominations. Two particular differences include the fact that the CRC has limited tenure for officebearers (so elders and deacons serve &quot;terms&quot;, not &quot;forever&quot;), and ministers are ordained and credentialed by a local congregation, not the regional classis or presbytery. Another key difference is that church polity in the CRC does not have confessional status and, therefore, the Church Order does not have the same authority as the creeds. The Church Order is subordinate to the creeds and confessions, which are subordinate to Scripture.

The Christian Reformed Church has three levels of assembly: the church council (local assembly, composed of a congregation&#x27;s deacons, elders, and ministerial staff), the classis (regional assembly, of which there are 48: 37 in the United States and 12 in Canada, with one straddling the international border), and the synod (bi-national assembly.) The church&#x27;s Synod meets annually in June, with 192 delegates: a minister, an elder and a deacon from each classis, plus one other officebearer.

Central offices of the church are located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Burlington, Ontario. The CRC in North America has sent missionaries to many countries around the world where Christian Reformed churches have been established, but these have organized on their own and are independent from the North American denomination.

==Education and agencies==
Reformed teaching puts an emphasis on education. As such, many CRC members support Christian day schools as well as post-secondary education.

The denomination owns and supports Calvin University as well as Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the denomination&#x27;s U.S. offices are located. Historically most ministers ordained in the CRC were trained at Calvin Seminary. Other colleges associated with the denomination are Kuyper College (also located in Grand Rapids), Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, Illinois; Dordt University in Sioux Center, Iowa; Redeemer University College in Ancaster, Ontario; The King&#x27;s University in Edmonton, Alberta, and the post-graduate Institute for Christian Studies in Toronto, Ontario.

Elim Christian Services in Palos Heights, Illinois, offers a school devoted to the education of those with special needs.

==Demographics==

CRC churches are predominantly located in areas of Dutch immigrant settlement in North America, including Brookfield, Wisconsin, Western Michigan, Chicago, the city of Lynden in Washington State, British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Alberta, Iowa, suburban southern California, Ripon, California, and northern New Jersey. About 75% of the CRCNA congregations are located in the US, while the remaining 25% are in Canada. The church has grown more ethnically diverse with some congregations predominantly Native American, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, African-American and Hispanic. All together, Christian Reformed Churches speak around 20 languages and over 170 congregations speak a language other than English or Dutch. Many churches, particularly in more urban areas, are becoming much more integrated. Emerging from its role as primarily an immigrant church, the church has become more outward focused in recent years.
==Membership trends==
After a time of steady growth during the period of 1963–1992, membership totals have declined, even though the number of churches has grown. In 1992, at the height of its membership, the Christian Reformed Churches had 316,415 members in 981 churches in the United States and Canada. In 2019 membership had dropped to 222,156 members in 1072 churches, marking a loss of 78,164 members (or 26% of its membership) in the last 25 years.

<doc id="351784" wikidata="Q2559328" url="?curid=351784" title="Furman v. Georgia">
<text>Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), was a landmark criminal case in which the United States Supreme Court decided that arbitrary and inconsistent imposition of the death penalty violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. It was a &quot;per curiam&quot; decision. Five justices each wrote separately in support of the decision. Although the justices did not rule that the death penalty was unconstitutional, the &quot;Furman&quot; decision invalidated the death sentences of nearly 700 people. The decision mandated a degree of consistency in the application of the death penalty. This case resulted in a &quot;de facto&quot; moratorium of capital punishment throughout the United States. Dozens of states rewrote their death penalty laws, most of which were upheld in the 1976 case &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;.
The Supreme Court consolidated the cases Jackson v. Georgia and Branch v. Texas with the &quot;Furman&quot; decision, thereby invalidating the death penalty for rape; this ruling was confirmed post-&quot;Gregg&quot; in &quot;Coker v. Georgia&quot;. The Court had also intended to include the case of &quot;Aikens v. California&quot;, but between the time &quot;Aikens&quot; had been heard in oral argument and a decision was to be issued, the Supreme Court of California decided in &quot;California v. Anderson&quot; that the death penalty violated the state constitution; &quot;Aikens&quot; was therefore dismissed as moot, since this decision reduced all death sentences in California to life imprisonment.

==Background==
There were over 600 inmates on death row when &quot;Furman&quot; was decided. Most states at that time did not allow the presentation of mitigating and aggravating evidence that today is a constitutionally required part of individualized consideration at sentencing. 

In &quot;McGautha v. California&quot;, decided thirteen months before &quot;Furman&quot;, the Court held that due process did not require instructions to the jury about standards to guide sentencing in capital cases. The Court also rejected a sentencing phase where mitigating or aggravating evidence could be presented to the jury.

After &quot;McGautha&quot; the infrequency and apparent randomness of sentencing in capital cases raised concerns about arbitrary imposition of the death penalty and the potentially improper influence of factors like race and financial resources on sentencing outcomes.

==Case history==

William Henry Furman, Lucious Jackson and Elmer Branch were three petitioners sentenced to death for aggravated felonies. Furman was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Jackson and Branch were convicted of rape (the victims were white, and in Branch&#x27;s case 65 years old).

The case of Earnest James Aikens was dropped from the &quot;Furman case&quot; because the California Supreme Court decided in &quot;People v. Anderson&quot; that the death penalty was unconstitutional under the state constitution. Because the California Supreme Court knew that &quot;Aikens&quot; and the other cases were pending at the United States Supreme Court the Attorney General filed a petition for certiorari claiming that California had attempted to evade Supreme Court jurisdiction by applying an identical provision in the state constitution. The petition was denied and &quot;Aikens&quot; was remanded to state court.

==Supreme Court decision==
The Court&#x27;s one-paragraph &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion held that &quot;the imposition of the death penalty...in these cases constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.&quot;

A majority of Justices agreed that arbitrariness in capital sentencing violated the Eighth Amendment. However, the justices could not agree as to a rationale. There was not any signed opinion of the court or any plurality opinion as none of the five justices in the majority joined the opinion of any other. It was the longest set of opinions the Court had ever written, over 233 pages.

===Per curiam opinion===
&quot;Furman&quot; ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional if it were arbitrarily applied in a manner that leads to discriminatory results. The median justices Potter Stewart and Byron White were concerned that erratic and arbitrary imposition of the death penalty violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Justice White said the death penalty was imposed so infrequently that the penological justification of deterrence was weakened and there was &quot;no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which it is imposed from the many cases in which it is not&quot;.

Deterrence was not the only penological justification discussed in the opinions. Justice Stewart said retributive punishment was a constitutionally permissible &quot;ingredient&quot; of punishment (a view subsequently supported by only four Justices in the &quot;Gregg&quot; plurality opinion):

I cannot agree that retribution is a constitutionally impermissible ingredient in the imposition of punishment...When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they &quot;deserve&quot;, then there are sown the seeds of anarchy—of self-help, vigilante justice and lynch law.

Justice Stewart was concerned the death penalty was being applied &quot;capriciously&quot;. There was no good explanation for why jurors imposed the death sentence in the three cases before the Court but not other cases &quot;just as reprehensible as these&quot;. In one of the most famous quotes from the case Justice Stewart said &quot;These death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual.&quot; If there was any identifiable basis for why the death penalty was imposed in these cases, it was &quot;the constitutionally impermissible basis of race&quot;.

Three justices raised concerns about racial bias. Justice Douglas said :
It would seem to be incontestible that the death penalty inflicted on one defendant is &#x27;unusual&#x27; if it discriminates against him by reason of his race, religion, wealth, social position, or class, or if it is imposed under such a procedure that gives room for the play of such prejudices. Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall concluded that the death penalty was in itself &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; because it was excessive, served no valid legislative purpose and was incompatible with the evolving standards of decency of a contemporary society. 

In his concurrence Justice Brennan said the low rate of jury imposed sentences, relative to number of death penalty eligible cases, indicated that sentencing outcomes were unconstitutionally arbitrary:

When the punishment of death is inflicted in a trivial number of the cases in which it is legally available, the conclusion is virtually inescapable that it is being inflicted arbitrarily ...When the rate of infliction is at this low level, it is highly implausible that only the worst criminals or the criminals who commit the worst crime are selected for this punishment.

Justice Marshall said Americans &quot;know almost nothing about capital punishment&quot; and would not &quot;knowingly support purposeless vengeance&quot;. Marshall rejected the deterrence justification by concluding &quot;the death penalty is no more effective a deterrent than life imprisonment.&quot; Marshall commented further on the possibility of wrongful execution, writing:
==Dissents==

Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Harry Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell, and William H. Rehnquist, each appointed by President Richard Nixon, dissented. 

They argued that determining the changing standards of decency and public opinion was a legislative function:

The widely divergent views of the Amendment expressed in today&#x27;s opinions reveal the haze that surrounds this constitutional command. Yet it is essential to our role as a court that we not seize upon the enigmatic character of the guarantee as an invitation to enact our personal predilections into law.

Blackmun and Burger also stated that they personally opposed the death penalty, and would vote against it, or &quot;restrict it to a small category of the most heinous crimes&quot;, but that it was constitutional. 

==Subsequent developments==

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision marked the first time the Justices vacated a death sentence under the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, resulting in over 630 death sentences being vacated and reduced to life imprisonment. There were not many cases of serious recidivism, but there were a few homicides, including an especially heinous case in Texas where several young women were raped and strangled.

Many thought the decision heralded the end of capital punishment in the United States. The next day, columnist Barry Schweid wrote that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States but there was a backlash and public support for the death penalty increased dramatically after the &quot;Furman&quot; decision. According to Stephen F. Smith the increase of public support for the death penalty was driven by the &quot;politicization of the death penalty&quot;. He says &quot;the number of executions might well have continued to decline but for the Court&#x27;s effort, in the early 1970s, to impose constitutional limits on capital punishment&quot;.

During the next four years, 35 states and the federal government enacted death penalty statutes intended to overcome the court&#x27;s concerns about the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.

Many of the new statutes that mandated bifurcated trials, with separate guilt-innocence and sentencing phases, and imposed standards guiding juries and judges during the penalty phase, were upheld in a series of Supreme Court decisions in 1976, beginning with &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; where the Court said that &quot;a carefully drafted statute that ensures that the sentencing authority is given adequate information and guidance&quot; would meet the constitutional standard of &quot;Furman&quot;. Other statutes enacted in response to &quot;Furman,&quot; such as Louisiana&#x27;s, which mandated imposition of the death penalty upon conviction of certain crimes, were invalidated for cases of that same year.

<text>Catherine Frederica &quot;Cathy&quot; Jones (born April 6, 1955) is a Canadian actress, comedian and writer. She is known for her work for 28 years on the Canadian television series &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. Jones left the show in 2021.

==Early life and CODCO==
Jones was born on 6 April 1955 in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. She was 17 when her older brother, comedian Andy Jones, put in a good word for her with the Newfoundland Traveling Theatre Company. After a summer touring with this company Cathy joined Tommy Sexton, Greg Malone, Mary Walsh, and Dyan Olsen in Toronto to look for more work in theatre and there in the fall of 1973, they formed the comedy troupe CODCO. Andy Jones and Robert Joy joined the company in early 1974.

==&quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;==
In 1992, Jones, comic Rick Mercer and former &quot;CODCO&quot; co-stars Mary Walsh and Greg Thomey created a new television series, &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. She played many unique characters on the show, and is known for playing both men and women often at the extreme edges of gender identity. Some of her more well known characters include Mrs. Enid, Babe Bennett, Joe Crow, and one of her personal favorites, &#x27;Love Murphy&#x27;, who played a love interest with her female character in the short film &quot;Outport Lesbian&quot;. As of 2005, with the departure of Greg Thomey, Jones was the only remaining original cast member of &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; at the time of her departure. Jones left the show in 2021.

In 2020, Jones reprised her longtime &quot;22 Minutes&quot; character of Miss Enid in the CBC Gem web series &quot;Broad Appeal: Living with E&#x27;s&quot;.

== Other work ==
Jones has toured extensively with her one-woman shows &quot;Wedding in Texas&quot; and &quot;Me, Dad and The Hundred Boyfriends&quot;. Her film career includes the lead role in her brother Mike Jones&#x27; film &quot;Secret Nation&quot;, which aired on CBC Television, and supporting roles in &quot;How to Be Deadly&quot; and Bruce McDonald&#x27;s &quot;Weirdos&quot;. A CBC &quot;Life and Times&quot; biopic titled &quot;Keeping up with Cathy Jones&quot; was produced in 2006 by Lynne Wilson, directed by Barbara Doran, and featured several of her co-stars from both &quot;CODCO&quot; and &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; including Greg Thomey, Rick Mercer, Greg Malone, and Andy Jones.

== Awards and accolades ==

Jones has won 18 Gemini Awards and three Canadian comedy awards for Best Writing in a Comedy Series for her work on &quot;22 Minutes&quot; and &quot;CODCO&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1996, Jones married American-born painter Paul Hannon, with whom she shares their daughter Eleanor. The couple divorced in 2000. For several years after 2004, Jones had a relationship with musician and artist Tom Wilson. They have since separated. Jones&#x27; first daughter, Mara, was born in Newfoundland in 1981.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Jones has been critical of mask wearing, restrictions and vaccines. She commented that &quot;people&#x27;s health should be really in their own hands and not in the hands of the government.&quot;

<text>Colin Andrew Mochrie (; born November 30, 1957) is a Scottish-born Canadian actor, writer, producer and improvisational comedian, best known for his appearances on the British and American versions of the improvisational TV show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;.

Mochrie honed his comedic talents with Vancouver&#x27;s TheatreSports League and Toronto&#x27;s Second City theatre. He has appeared in dozens of television series and films, as well as theatrical shows. With his wife, comedian Debra McGrath, Mochrie co-wrote, co-produced, and co-starred in the Canadian sitcoms &quot;Getting Along Famously&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s the Mayor&quot;. He has written for numerous other series and events, and wrote and performed for the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association dinner.

Mochrie&#x27;s work has been recognized with numerous awards, including two Canadian Comedy Awards, a Gemini Award, and a Writers Guild of Canada award. He was named Canadian Comedy Person of the Year at the 2013 Canadian Comedy Awards.

==Early life==
Colin Mochrie was born in Kilmarnock, Scotland, the oldest of three children. His father was an airline maintenance executive. He was shy as a child, stating that neighbours would have commented that he &quot;watched way too much television.&quot; In 1964, when Mochrie was seven years old, his family emigrated to Canada. They first settled in a neighbourhood just outside Montreal, Quebec, and five years later moved to Vancouver, British Columbia.

Mochrie attended Killarney Secondary School, where he was a self-proclaimed loner who wanted to become a marine biologist. He was persuaded by a friend to try out for a play titled &quot;The Death and Life of Sneaky Fitch&quot; in which Mochrie played the role of the undertaker. He was hooked when he got his first laugh, which inspired him to pursue a career in entertainment. After graduating from high school as valedictorian, Mochrie attended the Studio 58 theatre school at Langara College for four years, where he discovered the art of improvisational comedy.

==Career==
===Improvisational beginnings===
Upon graduation from Studio 58, Mochrie found his first line of work as a member of the Vancouver TheatreSports League. He started working with the group in 1980. Fame was slow to start, as Mochrie &quot;literally had to pull people out of McDonald&#x27;s to come see the shows.&quot; Mochrie originally had parts in plays while working for the group, but working for the TheatreSports League eventually became a full-time job for Mochrie. He met fellow improvisor Ryan Stiles during this time. He was visiting a mutual friend in New Zealand when Stiles was doing comedy at Punchlines. After the two met, Stiles and Mochrie began working at TheatreSports together. Though it has been stated that the two met while members of The Second City, the pair were already close friends, according to both Mochrie and Susan Trimbee, the former manager of The Second City Toronto (1985–1988).

Following Expo &#x27;86, Mochrie ended his tenure with the Vancouver TheatreSports League and moved to Toronto. Once there, Mochrie auditioned for The Second City comedy troupe, where Stiles was working. He began performing with the Second City National Touring Company where he met Debra McGrath, who was the director of the company at the time. The two married in 1989 and had a child, Kinley, in 1990.

Mochrie worked for The Second City for three years, co-writing and starring in three productions and directing three seasons of their national touring company. As a member of the touring company, he performed in many skits, including one where he and two others are at a bar, and they help him to rewrite an anecdote from his youth involving his father taking him to a baseball game; and a five-minute version of a James Bond movie, complete with Mochrie in a downhill ski chase and parachuting off a cliff.

===1988–1998===
Upon finishing his stint with Second City in 1988, Mochrie&#x27;s career was quiet for a while as he spent some time with his new wife and child. In 1989, he auditioned for the new British Channel 4 improv show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; but did not make the cut. Mochrie has stated that the audition was a good learning experience because while improv is about setting other people up to be funny, auditions should be about giving yourself the chance to stand out. He moved to Los Angeles the following year, but again auditioned for the British &quot;Whose Line&quot;, this time making the cut and being asked to fly to London. He appeared on one episode and was again let go. The third time Mochrie auditioned, he earned a regular spot on the show. He spent seven years as a regular on the UK version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; and remained a cast member until the show&#x27;s end in 1998.

After the British version of the show ended its run, Mochrie joined the American version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; hosted by Drew Carey on ABC. He was brought on alongside Ryan Stiles, who was also a regular member of the UK cast. Mochrie appeared on every episode from its debut in August 1998 to its finale in 2006. He noted his favourite games as &quot;Scenes From a Hat&quot;, where he would have to act out scenes based on suggestions by audience members, and &quot;Whose Line&quot; where he and Stiles would act out a scene and have to add in lines written on pieces of paper. He believed his weak spots were the musical segments and the &quot;Hoedown&quot; game, which he said was the only time during the show when he felt total fear. Mochrie, who cannot sing, usually spoke his lines instead of singing them.

Mochrie&#x27;s co-stars on the show would frequently mock him for being Canadian and for his receding hairline. Very early on in the UK version, however, Mochrie still had a fairly full head of hair, and the bald jokes were done at the expense of the UK host, Clive Anderson. In the American version, Mochrie would often perform the female role in certain frequently-performed skits, such as &quot;Whose Line&quot; and &quot;Two Line Vocabulary&quot;. In the few times he played the man in the scene, the producers were making further fun of his baldness (e.g. Colin was Samson, and Ryan was Delilah, and Samson had lost all his strength because Delilah had cut off his hair).

According to Mochrie&#x27;s agent, Jeff Andrews, during the show&#x27;s run Mochrie was better known in Canada as a &quot;commercial king&quot;, performing as characters such the Detergent Crusader for Sunlight detergent. In March 2005, a Nabisco advertising campaign starred Mochrie as the &quot;Snack Fairy&quot;, in which he wears a ballet tutu over ordinary slacks and a shirt. At the end of each commercial, he declares &quot;Snack happy!&quot; and waves his scepter with a smile.

Mochrie remained active elsewhere during his tenure as a &quot;Whose Line&quot; cast member. In early 1994, he played the role of Mike Brady in a musical version of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, directed by fellow Second City member Bruce Pirrie. In the production, Mochrie plays the character as caffeine-fuelled, jittery, and neurotic, an exaggeration of the Mike Brady television character, who often had a coffee in his hand on the show. Shortly before his move to the US version of &quot;Whose Line&quot; in 1998, Mochrie starred in the Canadian comedy series &quot;Supertown Challenge&quot; as the host of game shows, which the show spoofed. He also appeared in several episodes of the Canadian improvisational comedy series &quot;Improv Heaven and Hell&quot;.

===1999–2009===
In an interview, it was revealed that in 1999 Mochrie worked on the Miloš Forman film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, but his scenes were deleted from the final movie. Mochrie was a guest star in three episodes of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;: &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot; (1999), &quot;Drew Live&quot; (1999), and &quot;Drew Live II&quot; (2001). He also appeared on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Figure It Out&quot; as a celebrity guest panelist; in one segment of the show, he was slimed. He had a one-liner in the &quot;Bad Hare Day&quot; episode of &quot;Goosebumps&quot;, and he made special guest appearances in several episodes of &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;.

From 2001 through 2002, Mochrie co-starred in the Canadian comedy series &quot;Blackfly&quot; for the series&#x27; two seasons. He appeared in &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; on CBC Television from 2001 through 2003, and on the WB Television Network series &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Green Screen Show&quot; in 2004.

In 2003, Mochrie, Leslie Nielsen, Wayne Gretzky, and Roy Halladay appeared in print and television advertisements to encourage people to visit Toronto after the SARS outbreak that struck the city.

In May 2004, he hosted a guide to surviving animal attacks on Animal Planet known as &quot;Wild Survival Guide&quot;. He has done a commercial supporting Habitat For Humanity. He appeared briefly in a commercial for Buckley&#x27;s Cough Syrup, and he was featured in a commercial for New York Fries, manning a steamroller. He appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; as the superhero Overly Sensitive Man (inspired by &quot;Whose Line&quot;).

By 2004, Mochrie was appearing in so many media spots that a new Canadian television series, &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, made light of it by having him do a cameo appearance in the tenth episode. In 2005, Mochrie appeared in &quot;Burnt Toast&quot;, a series of eight comedic mini-operas, each depicting a different stage of a romantic relationship in a contemporary setting, produced by Canada&#x27;s Rhombus Media. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;The Surreal Gourmet&quot;. Along with Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Mochrie hosts a video introduction to a tour of the bakery in the Pacific Wharf area of Disney California Adventure Park. In the video, he helps explain how sourdough bread is made. On December 25, 2005, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation premièred the TV movie &quot;The Magical Gathering&quot;. Mochrie starred in this, and his daughter, Kinley, co-starred as Mochrie&#x27;s character at a younger age.

Mochrie starred in &quot;Getting Along Famously&quot; in 2006. In February 2007, he made a guest appearance as a priest in the seventh episode of &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot;, a Canadian television comedy series.

On March 28, 2007, Mochrie and his &quot;Whose Line&quot; costar Brad Sherwood hosted part of the Press Correspondents&#x27; Dinner with the President. At that event, Sherwood and Mochrie featured Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove rapping. Rove&#x27;s only line was &quot;MC Rove&quot;. On August 29, 2007, it was announced that Mochrie would host the Canadian version of the game show &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&quot;. The first of five episodes aired on October 25, 2007. As a result, Mochrie became the fifth member of the American &quot;Whose Line?&quot; cast to become a game show host, after colleagues Brad Sherwood (&quot;The Dating Game&quot; and &quot;The Big Moment&quot;), Greg Proops (&quot;Vs.&quot;, &quot;Head Games&quot; and &quot;Rendez-View&quot;), Wayne Brady (&quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;), and Drew Carey (&quot;Power of 10&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;).

The image of Mochrie&#x27;s face is used extensively in Animutation, a style of Flash animation. Neil Cicierega, the creator of Animutation, would place Mochrie in almost every Animutation he made, making the inclusion of him in Animutation somewhat of a running gag. Mochrie is aware of his status among Animutation artists and fans, having been quoted, &quot;It was very odd when I first saw the animutations. Obviously, the animators are more than a little crazy, but I am very proud of my standing in the animutation arena and hope that some day I can make millions off of it.&quot;

===2010–present===

In 2010, Mochrie acted in the Canadian television sitcom &quot;She&#x27;s the Mayor&quot;, which debuted in 2011. On July 19, 2010, Mochrie starred as the divorce lawyer working on the case of Spinner and Emma in &quot;Degrassi Takes Manhattan&quot;.

In 2011, Mochrie appeared as a regular cast member on &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Improv-A-Ganza&quot; on GSN. In 2012, Mochrie starred in the ABC improv comedy series &quot;Trust Us with Your Life&quot;.

Mochrie returned for the CW network&#x27;s revival of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; in the summer of 2013. He had a recurring role in the short-lived television comedy series &quot;Working the Engels&quot;.

In 2017 Mochrie made a cameo appearance complete with his trademark dry humour, as Ralph Fellows a hotel detective in an episode of the Canadian detective TV series &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot;.

In 2020 he hosted &quot;Mass Hysterical: A Comedic Cantata&quot;, a webcast collaboration between Second City alumni and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra which presented a comedic history of the use of classical and liturgical music in the church, for which he received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Lead Performance in a Web Program or Series at the 10th Canadian Screen Awards in 2022.

He has appeared on the revival of sketch comedy series &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, which was released on Amazon Prime Video on May 13, 2022. Mochrie co-created Hyprov, a comedy show that is a fusion of stage hypnosis and improvisation alongside hypnotist Asad Mecci and often co-stars as the improvisational comedian.

===Ongoing two-man show with Brad Sherwood===
Mochrie and &quot;Whose Line&quot; co-star Brad Sherwood have intermittently toured North America as a two-man stage show since 2002. Initially called &quot;An Evening with Colin and Brad&quot;, they played primarily in small theatre venues. A DVD of their performances, &quot;Colin &amp; Brad: Two Man Group&quot;, was released on March 8, 2011.

As of 2018, Mochrie and Sherwood have continued their performances, billed as the &quot;Scared Scriptless Tour&quot;, and are playing in larger venues such as the Sydney Opera House and London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall.

==Personal life==
Mochrie lives with his wife, Canadian actress Debra McGrath, in Toronto. The two have been married since January 8, 1989, and together they have a daughter, Kinley Mochrie. In 2017, with her permission, Mochrie revealed on Twitter that Kinley is transgender. In 2018, after Mochrie posted a picture with his wife and daughter on Facebook wishing her a happy birthday, he received hateful comments from trolls. He responded by saying in a post the following day, &quot;Thanks to the fans of this page for being supportive and human. To the trolls, my thoughts and prayers to your body for losing its mind and soul so tragically.&quot; When Mochrie competed on &quot;LOL: Last One Laughing Canada&quot; in 2022, he played for Rainbow Camp, an affirming summer camp program for LGBTQ youth in Thessalon.

Mochrie is related to Canadian actor Munro Chambers by marriage. In a 2010 interview, Chambers stated:

&quot;I could say many things... my uncle, for one thing, is Colin Mochrie. He&#x27;s been my inspiration getting into the industry. He&#x27;s my uncle-in-law; his wife is my dad&#x27;s cousin. My dad and his cousin, they were kind of like brother and sister growing up, so he&#x27;s my uncle by law. We have a good relationship.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
Mochrie has been nominated for five Canadian Comedy Awards and has won two. He has also won a Gemini Award and a Writers Guild of Canada award for &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. In 2013, Mochrie was awarded Canadian Comedy Person of the Year at the Canadian Comedy Awards.

<doc id="351798" wikidata="Q1935806" url="?curid=351798" title="Neighbor joining">
<text>In bioinformatics, neighbor joining is a bottom-up (agglomerative) clustering method for the creation of phylogenetic trees, created by Naruya Saitou and Masatoshi Nei in 1987. Usually based on DNA or protein sequence data, the algorithm requires knowledge of the distance between each pair of taxa (e.g., species or sequences) to create the phylogenetic tree.

== The algorithm ==

Neighbor joining takes a distance matrix, which specifies the distance between each pair of taxa, as input.
The algorithm starts with a completely unresolved tree, whose topology corresponds to that of a star network, and iterates over the following steps, until the tree is completely resolved, and all branch lengths are known:

# Based on the current distance matrix, calculate a matrix formula_1 (defined below).
# Find the pair of distinct taxa i and j (i.e. with formula_2) for which formula_3 is smallest. Make a new node that joins the taxa i and j, and connect the new node to the central node. For example, in part (B) of the figure at right, node u is created to join f and g.
# Calculate the distance from each of the taxa in the pair to this new node.
# Calculate the distance from each of the taxa outside of this pair to the new node.
# Start the algorithm again, replacing the pair of joined neighbors with the new node and using the distances calculated in the previous step.

=== The Q-matrix ===
Based on a distance matrix relating the formula_4 taxa, calculate the formula_4 x formula_4 matrix formula_1 as follows:

where formula_8 is the distance between taxa formula_9 and formula_10.

=== Distance from the pair members to the new node ===
For each of the taxa in the pair being joined, use the following formula to calculate the distance to the new node:
and:
: formula_11

Taxa formula_12 and formula_13 are the paired taxa and formula_14 is the newly created node. The branches joining formula_12 and formula_14 and formula_13 and formula_14, and their lengths, formula_19 and formula_20 are part of the tree which is gradually being created; they neither affect nor are affected by later neighbor-joining steps.

=== Distance of the other taxa from the new node ===
For each taxon not considered in the previous step, we calculate the distance to the new node as follows:

where formula_14 is the new node, formula_22 is the node which we want to calculate the distance to and formula_12 and formula_13 are the members of the pair just joined.

=== Complexity ===
Neighbor joining on a set of formula_4 taxa requires formula_26 iterations. At each step one has to build and search a formula_1 matrix. Initially the formula_1 matrix is size formula_29, then the next step it is formula_30, etc. Implementing this in a straightforward way leads to an algorithm with a time complexity of formula_31; implementations exist which use heuristics to do much better than this on average.

== Example ==

Let us assume that we have five taxa formula_32 and the following distance matrix formula_33:

=== First step ===
====First joining====
We calculate the formula_34 values by equation (). For example:
:formula_35
:formula_36

We obtain the following values for the formula_34 matrix (the diagonal elements of the matrix are not used and are
omitted here):

In the example above, formula_38. This is the smallest value of formula_34, so we join elements formula_40 and formula_41.

====First branch length estimation====
Let formula_14 denote the new node. By equation (), above, the branches joining formula_40 and formula_41 to formula_14 then have lengths:

:formula_46
:formula_47

====First distance matrix update====
We then proceed to update the initial distance matrix formula_33 into a new distance matrix formula_49 (see below), reduced in size by one row and one column because of the joining of formula_40 with formula_41 into their neighbor formula_14. Using equation () above, we compute the distance from formula_14 to each of the other nodes besides formula_40 and formula_41. In this case, we obtain:

:formula_56
:formula_57
:formula_58

The resulting distance matrix formula_49 is:

Bold values in formula_49 correspond to the newly calculated distances, whereas italicized values are not affected by the matrix update as they correspond to distances between elements not involved in the first joining of taxa.

=== Second step ===
====Second joining====
The corresponding formula_61 matrix is:

We may choose either to join formula_14 and formula_63, or to join formula_64 and formula_65; both pairs have the minimal formula_61 value of formula_67, and either choice leads to the same result. For concreteness, let us join formula_14 and formula_63 and call the new node formula_70.

====Second branch length estimation====
The lengths of the branches joining formula_14 and formula_63 to formula_70 can be calculated:

:formula_74
:formula_75

The joining of the elements and the branch length calculation help drawing the neighbor joining tree as shown in the figure.

====Second distance matrix update====
The updated distance matrix formula_76 for the remaining 3 nodes, formula_70, formula_64, and formula_65, is now computed:

:formula_80
:formula_81

=== Final step ===
The tree topology is fully resolved at this point. However, for clarity, we can calculate the formula_82 matrix. For example:

:formula_83

For concreteness, let us join formula_70 and formula_64 and call the last node formula_86. The lengths of the three remaining branches can be calculated:

:formula_87

The neighbor joining tree is now complete, as shown in the figure.

=== Conclusion: additive distances ===
This example represents an idealized case: note that if we move from any taxon to any other along the branches of the tree, and sum the lengths of the branches traversed, 
the result is equal to the distance between those taxa in the input distance matrix. For example, going from formula_64 to formula_41 we have formula_92. A distance matrix whose distances agree in this way with some tree is said to be &#x27;additive&#x27;, a property which is rare in practice. Nonetheless it is important to note that, given an additive distance matrix as input, neighbor joining is guaranteed to find the tree whose distances between taxa agree with it.

== Neighbor joining as minimum evolution ==
Neighbor joining may be viewed as a greedy heuristic for the balanced minimum evolution (BME) criterion. For each topology, BME defines the tree length (sum of branch lengths) to be a particular weighted sum of the distances in the distance matrix, with the weights depending on the topology. The BME optimal topology is the one which minimizes this tree length. NJ at each step greedily joins that pair of taxa which will give the greatest decrease in the estimated tree length. This procedure does not guarantee to find the optimum for the BME criterion, although it often does and is usually quite close.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

The main virtue of NJ is that it is fast as compared to least squares, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods.
This makes it practical for analyzing large data sets (hundreds or thousands of taxa) and for bootstrapping, for which purposes other means of analysis (e.g. maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood) may be computationally prohibitive.

Neighbor joining has the property that if the input distance matrix is correct, then the output tree will be correct.
Furthermore, the correctness of the output tree topology is guaranteed as long as the distance matrix is &#x27;nearly additive&#x27;, specifically if each entry in the distance matrix differs from the true distance by less than half of the shortest branch length in the tree.
In practice the distance matrix rarely satisfies this condition, but neighbor joining often constructs the correct tree topology anyway. The correctness of neighbor joining for nearly additive distance matrices implies that it is statistically consistent under many models of evolution; given data of sufficient length, neighbor joining will reconstruct the true tree with high probability.
Compared with UPGMA and WPGMA, neighbor joining has the advantage that it does not assume all lineages evolve at the same rate (molecular clock hypothesis). 
Nevertheless, neighbor joining has been largely superseded by phylogenetic methods that do not rely on distance measures and offer superior accuracy under most conditions. Neighbor joining has the undesirable feature that it often assigns negative lengths to some of the branches.

==Implementations and variants==
There are many programs available implementing neighbor joining. Among implementations of &quot;canonical&quot; NJ (i.e. using the classical NJ optimisation criteria, therefore giving the same results), RapidNJ (started 2003, major update in 2011, still updated in 2023) and NINJA (started 2009, last update 2013) are considered state-of-the-art. They have typical run times proportional to approximately the square of the number of taxa.

Variants that deviate from canonical include:
* BIONJ (1997) and Weighbor (2000), improving on the accuracy by making use of the fact that the shorter distances in the distance matrix are generally better known than the longer distances. The two methods have been extended to run on incomplete distance matrices.
* &quot;Fast NJ&quot; remembers the best node and is O(n^2) always; &quot;relax NJ&quot; performs a hill-climbing search and retains the worst-case complexity of O(n^3). Rapid NJ is faster than plain relaxed NJ.
* FastME is an implementation of the closely related &quot;balanced minimum evolution&quot; (BME) method (see ). It is about as fast as and more accurate than NJ. It starts with a rough tree then improves it using a set of topological moves such as Nearest Neighbor Interchanges (NNI). FastTree is a related method. It works on sequence &quot;profiles&quot; instead of a matrix. It starts with an approximately NJ tree, rearranges it into BME, then rearranges it into approximate maximum-likelihood.

<text>A fractionating column or fractional column is equipment used in the distillation of liquid mixtures to separate the mixture into its component parts, or fractions, based on their differences in volatility. Fractionating columns are used in small-scale laboratory distillations as well as large-scale industrial distillations.

==Laboratory fractionating columns==
A laboratory fractionating column is a piece of glassware used to separate vaporized mixtures of liquid compounds with close volatility. Most commonly used is either a Vigreux column or a straight column packed with glass beads or metal pieces such as Raschig rings. Fractionating columns help to separate the mixture by allowing the mixed vapors to cool, condense, and vaporize again in accordance with Raoult&#x27;s law. With each condensation-vaporization cycle, the vapors are enriched in a certain component. A larger surface area allows more cycles, improving separation. This is the rationale for a Vigreux column or a packed fractionating column. Spinning band distillation achieves the same outcome by using a rotating band within the column to force the rising vapors and descending condensate into close contact, achieving equilibrium more quickly.

In a typical fractional distillation, a liquid mixture is heated in the distilling flask, and the resulting vapor rises up the fractionating column (see Figure 1). The vapor condenses on glass spurs (known as theoretical trays or theoretical plates) inside the column, and returns to the distilling flask, refluxing the rising distillate vapor. The hottest tray is at the bottom of the column and the coolest tray is at the top. At steady-state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray reach an equilibrium. Only the most volatile of the vapors stays in gas form all the way to the top, where it may then proceed through a condenser, which cools the vapor until it condenses into a liquid distillate. The separation may be enhanced by the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.).

==Industrial fractionating columns==

Fractional distillation is one of the unit operations of chemical engineering. Fractionating columns are widely used in chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled. Such industries are petroleum processing, petrochemical production, natural gas processing, coal tar processing, brewing, liquefied air separation, and hydrocarbon solvents production. Fractional distillation finds its widest application in petroleum refineries. In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a complex, multicomponent mixture that must be separated. Yields of pure chemical compounds are generally not expected, however, yields of groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, also called &quot;fractions&quot;, are expected. This process is the origin of the name &quot;fractional distillation&quot; or &quot;fractionation&quot;.

Distillation is one of the most common and energy-intensive separation processes. Effectiveness of separation is dependent upon the height and diameter of the column, the ratio of the column&#x27;s height to diameter, and the material that comprises the distillation column itself. In a typical chemical plant, it accounts for about 40% of the total energy consumption. Industrial distillation is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns (as shown in Figure 2) known as &quot;distillation towers&quot; or &quot;distillation columns&quot; with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 6 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 60 meters or more.

Industrial distillation towers are usually operated at a continuous steady state. Unless disturbed by changes in feed, heat, ambient temperature, or condensing, the amount of feed being added normally equals the amount of product being removed.

The amount of heat entering the column from the reboiler and with the feed must equal the amount heat removed by the overhead condenser and with the products. The heat entering a distillation column is a crucial operating parameter, addition of excess or insufficient heat to the column can lead to foaming, weeping, entrainment, or flooding.

Figure 3 depicts an industrial fractionating column separating a feed stream into one distillate fraction and one bottoms fraction. However, many industrial fractionating columns have outlets at intervals up the column so that multiple products having different boiling ranges may be withdrawn from a column distilling a multi-component feed stream. The &quot;lightest&quot; products with the lowest boiling points exit from the top of the columns and the &quot;heaviest&quot; products with the highest boiling points exit from the bottom.

Industrial fractionating columns use external reflux to achieve better separation of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product that returns to the upper part of the fractionating column as shown in Figure 3.

Inside the column, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficacy of the distillation tower. The more reflux and/or more trays provided, the better is the tower&#x27;s separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials.

The design and operation of a fractionating column depends on the composition of the feed as well as the composition of the desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation can be used. For a multi-component feed, simulation models are used both for design, operation, and construction.

Bubble-cap &quot;trays&quot; or &quot;plates&quot; are one of the types of physical devices, which are used to provide good contact between the upflowing vapor and the downflowing liquid inside an industrial fractionating column. Such trays are shown in Figures 4 and 5.

The efficiency of a tray or plate is typically lower than that of a theoretical 100% efficient equilibrium stage. Hence, a fractionating column almost always needs more actual, physical plates than the required number of theoretical vapor–liquid equilibrium stages. 

In industrial uses, sometimes a packing material is used in the column instead of trays, especially when low pressure drops across the column are required, as when operating under vacuum. This packing material can either be random dumped packing ( wide) such as Raschig rings or structured sheet metal. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing, and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance.

<doc id="351808" wikidata="Q630417" url="?curid=351808" title="Uppingham">
<text>Uppingham is a market town and civil parish in the ceremonial county of Rutland, England, off the A47 between Leicester and Peterborough, south of Oakham. It had a population of 4,745 according to the 2011 census, estimated at 4,853 in 2019. 

The town is known for its eponymous public school. With its art galleries Uppingham has become a popular destination for art lovers. Uppingham was named &quot;best place to live in the Midlands in 2022&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, who commented on the town by calling it &quot;a discerning market town with art, heart and smarts — plus the magnificent Rutland Water&quot;.

== Toponymy ==
The name of the town means &#x27;Homestead/village of the Yppingas (upland people)&#x27;. It stands on a high ridge near Beaumont Chase, hence &quot;upland&quot;.

==History==
A little over to the north-west at Castle Hill are the earthwork remains of a medieval motte and bailey castle. Uppingham became a market town in 1281 when the lord of the manor was given the right to hold a weekly market.
The town has two active churches; The Church of St Peter and St Paul, a largely 14th-century Church of England parish church and the Methodist Church on Orange street, built as a Wesleyan Chapel in 1819 and expanded in the 1870s and 1880s. 

Uppingham Workhouse was first recorded in 1777 with space for 40 inmates. Until 1834 it was a parish workhouse, but in 1836 the Uppingham Poor Law Union began and a Union workhouse was built in Leicester Road to house 158, to a design by architect William Donthorne. In the First World War, the building was used as an auxiliary hospital staffed by a Voluntary Aid Detachment. The workhouse closed in 1929 and the building was taken over by Uppingham School, which uses it as a girls&#x27; boarding house called Constables.
The Eyebrook Reservoir near Uppingham was used by Avro Lancasters flying from RAF Scampton on the final practice run for Guy Gibson&#x27;s 617 Squadron Dambusters before Operation Chastise, the attack on the Ruhr valley dams on the night of the 16–17 May 1943.

==Market==
The weekly market is held on Fridays. The Market Place is transformed once a year in November into the only fatstock show still held in temporary penning in a traditional market town. The first recorded show was in 1889. In 2011, 140 sheep, 24 pigs and 20 cattle were entered. The event attracts farmers from the area to exhibit their prize livestock and then toast their acquaintances in &quot;The Falcon Hotel&quot;.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Uppingham, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Uppingham Town Council and Rutland County Council. The town council is based at Uppingham Town Hall at 49 High Street East. Most local government functions are provided by the county council. The town council is responsible for services such as allotments, cemeteries and open spaces.

Uppingham was an ancient parish. When elected parish and district councils were created under the Local Government Act 1894, Uppingham was given a parish council and included in the Uppingham Rural District.

The rural district council was abolished in 1974 and its functions passed to Rutland District Council (renamed Rutland County Council on becoming a unitary authority in 1997). Also in 1974, Uppingham Parish Council bought the former Church Rooms at 49 High Street East, which had been built in 1932. In 1980, Uppingham Parish Council formally declared the parish to be a town for the purposes of the Local Government Act 1972, allowing it to change its name to Uppingham Town Council and appoint a mayor. The former Church Rooms were renamed the Town Hall at the same time.

==Education==
State schooling in Uppingham is covered by a state secondary school, Uppingham Community College, and two primary schools: Leighfield and Uppingham C of E. A proposal to replace the primaries with a newly built school was rejected in 2007.

Uppingham School is an independent school for boarders aged 13 to 18, founded in 1584, charging fees and mainly for boys. Girls have been admitted since 1975.

== Art ==
Uppingham has several independent and internationally renowned art galleries. The Goldmark Gallery has been selling art from their Uppingham gallery for over 40 years and hold over 50,000 items in stock.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Waltham TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leicester on 104.9 FM, Smooth East Midlands on 106.6 FM, Capital East Midlands on 105.4 FM, Hits Radio East Midlands on 106.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands (which used to be Rutland Radio) on 107.2 FM, and Rutland and Stamford Sound, a community based radio station which broadcast on DAB.

The &quot;Rutland Mercury&quot; and &quot;Rutland Times&quot; are the local newspapers that serve the town.

==Transport==
===Rail===
The nearest railway station is Oakham – north – on the cross-country line between Birmingham, Leicester and Peterborough. Alternatively, Corby station south on the Oakham branch of the Midland Main Line provides frequent services to London.
Uppingham railway station, at the end of a branch line from Seaton, was opened in 1894 and was located at the end of Queen Street. Passenger services were withdrawn in 1960 and the line closed completely in 1964. The station area has now been redeveloped as an industrial estate. Although the operational railway line runs closest to Uppingham at Manton Junction, it has no station.

===Roads===
An east-west A47 bypass opened in June 1982, providing a link to Peterborough and Leicester. The A6003 runs through the town and links Uppingham with Oakham, Corby and Kettering.

===Buses===
Centrebus operates the majority of bus services. The main routes link the town with Oakham, Corby, Leicester (via the 747 Uppingham–Leicester), Peterborough and Stamford.

==Sport==
Uppingham plays host to a number of different sports; in particular football, where Uppingham Town F.C play their games at Tod&#x27;s Piece. Uppingham Town Cricket Club&#x27;s new ground opened in 2011.
Uppingham School&#x27;s new sports centre was opened by Lord Coe in 2010.

==Town Partnership==
&#x27;Uppingham Town Partnership&#x27; is a not-for-profit community group with the support of the Town Council and Rutland County Council, dedicated to ensuring the town is a great place to live, work and play. Its volunteers organise annual events including &quot;Uppingham Feast Day&quot; (a live music festival with street entertainment, food and drink) held in June and Christmas in Uppingham (a festive celebration with late night shopping in the local shops, visiting market-stalls and yuletide street entertainment). The group of volunteers also supports and raises funds for other events such &quot;Uppingham Films&quot; which screens movies in the Town Hall, and supports &#x27;Uppingham in Bloom&#x27; which has become a multiple gold-medal winner with Britain in Bloom. It is not to be confused with Uppingham First, which is an unelected business partnership.

<doc id="351810" wikidata="Q902771" url="?curid=351810" title="Bravo (American TV network)">
<text>Bravo is an American basic cable television network, launched on December 8, 1980. It is owned by the NBCUniversal Media Group division of Comcast&#x27;s NBCUniversal. The channel originally focused on programming related to fine arts and film. Since the 2000s, its has focused heavily on reality series targeted at 25-to-54-year-old women and the LGBTQIA2S+ community at large. Its former sister channels are Nickelodeon and IFC, which are currently owned by Paramount Global and AMC Networks, respectively. , Bravo is available to approximately 70,000,000 pay television households in the United States, down from its 2013 peak of 95,000,000 households.

==History==
=== Launch and early programming ===
Bravo originally launched as a commercial-free premium channel on December 8, 1980. It was originally co-owned by Cablevision&#x27;s Rainbow Media division and Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment; the channel claimed to be &quot;the first television service dedicated to film and the performing arts&quot;. The channel originally broadcast its programming two days a week and—like Bravo&#x27;s former sister network Nickelodeon, which shared its channel space with Alpha Repertory Television Service—shared its channel space with the adult-oriented pay channel Escapade (now Playboy TV), which featured R-rated B movies (of the action, grindhouse and horror genres) and softcore pornographic films. In 1981, Bravo was available to 48,000 subscribers throughout the United States; this total increased four years later to around 350,000 subscribers. A 1985 profile of Bravo in &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that most of its programming consisted of international, classic, and independent film. Celebrities such as E. G. Marshall and Roberta Peters provided opening and closing commentary to the films broadcast on the channel.

Performing arts programs seen on Bravo included the show &quot;Jazz Counterpoint&quot;. During the mid-1980s, Bravo converted from a premium service into a basic cable channel, although it remained a commercial-free service. Bravo signed an underwriting deal with Texaco in 1992 and within a month broadcast the first Texaco Showcase production, a stage adaptation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. By the mid-1990s, Bravo began to incorporate more PBS-style underwriting sponsorships, and then began accepting traditional commercial advertising by 1998.

In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Television&quot;, Megan Mullen perceived certain Bravo programs as &quot;considered too risky or eclectic for mainstream channels&quot;. Those programs were &quot;Karaoke&quot; and &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot;, the final serials by British playwright Dennis Potter shown by Bravo in June 1997, and Michael Moore&#x27;s documentary series &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; from 1999.

===Acquisition by NBC, shift to reality ===

In 1999, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired a 20% stake in the channel, which it subsequently sold back to Rainbow Media in 2001. National Broadcasting Company, Inc. bought the network in 2002 for $1.25 billion; it had owned a stake in the channel and its sister networks for several years up to that point. NBC&#x27;s then-parent company, General Electric, merged the network and its other broadcast and cable properties with Vivendi Universal Entertainment in May 2004 to form NBC Universal.

In 2003, Bravo began airing reruns of &quot;The West Wing&quot; for several years, including running marathons on certain holidays.

Bravo saw a massive success in 2003 with the reality series &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;, which garnered 3.5 million viewers. The network began to add more reality shows to its lineup, some of them also very successful, including &quot;Project Runway&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Million Dollar Listing&quot;, &quot;The Real Housewives of Orange County&quot; and &quot;Top Chef&quot;, all in 2006. All spawned numerous spin-off shows, and some even turned into international franchises. The success of all these shows led Bravo to change its format from focusing on performing arts, drama, and independent film to being focused on reality series, pop culture, fashion and celebrities. In 2009, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put &quot;Bravo reality shows&quot; on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;From Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&#x27;s Fab Five to Project Runway&#x27;s fierce fashionistas to the kvetching, perma-tanned Real Housewives franchise, Bravo&#x27;s quirky reality programming mixes high culture and low scruples to create deliciously addictive television.&quot;

A study released in May 2008 ranked Bravo as the brand most identified as gay-friendly among gay consumers. Bravo&#x27;s age demographic is people 18–54, according to the Cable Television Advertising Bureau&#x27;s cable television profiles.

Other successful reality series followed, including &quot;Shahs of Sunset&quot; (2012), &quot;Vanderpump Rules&quot; (2013), &quot;Married to Medicine&quot; (2013), &quot;Below Deck&quot; (2013), &quot;Southern Charm&quot; (2014), and &quot;Summer House&quot; (2017). Bravo&#x27;s first ever scripted series, &quot;Girlfriends&#x27; Guide to Divorce&quot;, premiered in 2014 and ran until 2018.

On February 7, 2017, coinciding with the premiere of another scripted series, &quot;Imposters&quot;, Bravo updated its imaging with a refresh to its speech bubble-inspired logo, with the letters now all rendered in lowercase (replacing the wordmark text based on the logos used by the channel between 1994 and 2005), and a neutralized imaging to attract more male viewers. The &quot;...by Bravo&quot; marketing tag was also phased out from general use.

On November 20, 2024, NBCUniversal announced that it would spin off most of its cable networks and selected digital properties into a new publicly-traded company (&quot;SpinCo&quot;) owned by Comcast shareholders, with NBCUniversal Media Group chairman Mark Lazarus as CEO. Bravo was notably excluded from the spin-off, due to its position as a major content provider for NBCU&#x27;s streaming service Peacock.

==Controversies==
In August 2023, several of the network&#x27;s reality stars, including Bethenny Frankel, Raquel Leviss, Lisa Rinna, and many others, accused Bravo and its parent company, NBCUniversal, for mistreating and causing a hostile working environment against them. Frankel has also filed a lawsuit against the network and NBC as a result of the allegations.

In January 2024, Caroline Manzo filed a lawsuit against Bravo which alleged that the network and its affiliated companies—Forest Productions, Warner Bros. Entertainment, NBCUniversal Media, Shed Media and Peacock TV— would &quot;regularly ply the Real Housewives cast with alcohol, cause them to become severely intoxicated, and then direct, encourage and/or allow them to sexually harass other cast members because that is good for ratings.&quot; The lawsuit was filed a year after it was reported Brandi Glanville gave Manzo &quot;unwanted kisses&quot; while they participated in season 5 of &quot;The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip&quot;. The lawsuit also accused Bravo of knowing that Glanville had a history of sexual misconduct, but hired her anyway for good ratings.

==Programming==
Bravo&#x27;s programming schedule primarily includes originally produced programming, particularly reality content. Most popularly, the channel is known for its TV franchises &quot;The Real Housewives&quot; and &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, as well as &quot;Top Chef&quot;, &quot;Project Runway&quot;, &quot;Flipping Out&quot;, &quot;Below Deck&quot;, and &quot;Married to Medicine&quot;. The channel also airs reruns of series from parent network NBC and occasionally other NBCUniversal-owned networks, off-network series, including those from NBCUniversal Television Distribution, and feature films, primarily from the Universal Pictures catalog. Bravo utilizes block programming for both new shows and existing ones such as its &quot;Fashion By Bravo&quot; block.

Following its acquisition by NBC, Bravo began to supplement NBC Sports coverage of the Olympic Games, airing live events during the overnight and morning hours during the 2004 Summer Olympics; this coverage continued with the 2006 Winter Olympics. The channel carried no coverage during the 2008 games, as NBC Universal had acquired Oxygen, allowing Bravo to continue to carry its regular programming schedule during NBC coverage of the Games. In 2012, the network served as the near-exclusive home for the Games&#x27; tennis tournament at Wimbledon, with up to 56 hours of coverage except for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles finals, which aired on NBC. During the 2016 Rio Olympics, Bravo served as the exclusive home of the entire tennis tournament.

==International versions==
=== Australia ===
An Australian channel called Arena rebranded its on-air presentation in 2008 to align with Bravo as a result of an agreement with Bravo Media. Arena uses the now-former Bravo slogan &quot;Watch What Happens&quot; and has access to Bravo-produced programming. As of July 2020, the channel had dropped the Bravo-inspired branding, and added content from other providers such as WarnerMedia. In October 2022, it was announced that Australia&#x27;s Seven Network would launch a local version of the network, titled 7Bravo on 15 January 2023, as part of a joint venture with NBCU.

=== Canada ===
A Canadian version of Bravo was launched in 1995 by CHUM Limited. The channel originally aired much of the same arts-focused genres of programming then aired by its American counterpart. Around the same period of its U.S. counterpart&#x27;s channel drift, though particularly after its acquisition by Bell Media, Bravo Canada would pivot its focus toward television dramas, and was later rebranded as CTV Drama Channel in 2019.

Most of Bravo&#x27;s original programming would be acquired by other Canadian speciality channels and domestic platforms. Corus Entertainment&#x27;s Slice and Food Network Canada would acquire such shows as &quot;The Real Housewives&quot; franchise and &quot;Top Chef&quot;, respectively, and would also commission domestic adaptations (&quot;The Real Housewives of Vancouver&quot; and &quot;Toronto&quot;; &quot;Top Chef Canada&quot;) of these franchises. In 2018, NBCUniversal&#x27;s streaming service Hayu, would launch in Canada; and feature several shows and franchises from Bravo and its siblings. 

On June 10, 2024, Rogers Sports &amp; Media announced that it had acquired Canadian rights to the Bravo brand and original programming, and that it planned to relaunch the network in September 2024, with Rogers later announcing that Bravo would replace OLN (a channel originally established as the Canadian version of a different now-defunct Comcast network).

=== New Zealand ===
MediaWorks New Zealand announced that it would close the youth-oriented free to air channel Four in July 2016 and replace it with Bravo as part of a deal with NBCUniversal. The New Zealand channel is currently co-owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.

=== Brazil ===
A Brazilian version of Bravo was launched in 1996 by a partnership between TVA - then Grupo Abril&#x27;s television arm -, TV Cultura and the original American network. The channel produced original programming like the Brazilian version of Inside Actors Studio called Studio Brasil. In August 1999, Bravo was rebranded as Film&amp;Arts after Bravo Networks took the fully control of channel&#x27;s administration.

== Bravo&#x27;s A-List Awards ==
In 2008, Bravo&#x27;s A-List Awards were created to honor celebrities &quot;who have made an unforgettable mark&quot; in various fields of pop culture such as beauty, design, fashion, and cooking.

<text>Coalville is a town in the district of North West Leicestershire, Leicestershire in the East Midlands of England. In 2011, it had a population of 34,575. It lies on the A511 between Leicester and Burton upon Trent, close to junction 22 of the M1 motorway where the A511 meets the A50 between Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Leicester. It borders the upland area of Charnwood Forest to the east of the town.

Coalville is twinned with Romans-sur-Isère in southeastern France.

==History==
Coalville is a product of the Industrial Revolution. As its name indicates, it is a former coal mining town and was a centre of the coal-mining district of north Leicestershire. It has been suggested that the name may derive from the name of the house belonging to the founder of Whitwick Colliery: &#x27;Coalville House&#x27;. However, conclusive evidence is a report in the &quot;Leicester Chronicle&quot; of 16 November 1833: &#x27;Owing to the traffic which has been produced by the Railway and New Collieries on Whitwick Waste, land which 20 years ago would not have fetched , is now selling in lots at from , for building upon. The high chimneys, and numerous erections upon the spot, give the neighbourhood quite an improved appearance. We hear it is intended to call this new colony &quot;COALVILLE&quot; - an appropriate name.&#x27;

===Pre-industrial period===
In the early nineteenth century, the area now known as Coalville was little more than a track known as Long Lane, which ran approximately east–west, stretching between two turnpikes, Bardon and Hoo Ash. Long Lane divided the parishes of Swannington and Whitwick (both lying to the north of Long Lane) from the parishes of Snibston and Ibstock (both lying to the south). Hugglescote and Donington-le-Heath were part of Ibstock parish until 1878. A north-south track or lane stretching from Whitwick to Hugglescote crossed Long Lane, at the point where the clock tower war memorial now stands. This track or lane is now Mantle Lane and Belvoir Road. The Red House, an eighteenth-century building, close to this cross-roads, was one of very few buildings then standing.

Samuel Fisher, writing his memoirs at the end of the nineteenth century, described what the area looked like in 1832. Standing close to the position of the present-day clock tower, Fisher describes how, on looking down Long Lane towards Ashby, &quot;we see a large tract of waste on both sides of the road, still traceable, covered with gorse-bushes, blackberry brambles, etc., with not a single house on either side of the way&quot; until arriving at the Hoo Ash turnpike. Then, looking toward Hugglescote (down a track that is now Belvoir Road), &quot;we see a magnificently timbered lane without a single house, with the exception of White Leys Farm and the Gate Inn on the Ashby Turnpike&quot;. In the direction of Bardon, there were no houses until arriving at a group of five or six cottages on the corner of what is now Whitwick Road and Hotel Street, and in the direction of Whitwick (the modern day Mantle Lane) there was nothing apart from a smithy and a carpenter&#x27;s shop, and the houses of these tradesmen. These would have stood on the site of what is now The Springboard Centre (formerly Stablefords wagon works). From this wilderness emerged the modern town of Coalville, on a rapid scale, following the advent of deep coal mining.

Despite its emergence as one of the largest towns in Leicestershire, Coalville&#x27;s history was not well documented until the establishment of historical societies in the 1980s, though some information had been put on record by a few independent local historians. In more recent years, a wealth of material charting the town&#x27;s history has been published through the combined efforts of the Coalville 150 Group and the Coalville Historical Society and in 2006, these two groups amalgamated to form the Coalville Heritage Society.

===Coal-mining===
Coal has been mined in the area since the medieval period, a heritage also traceable in the place name Coleorton, and examples of mine workings from these times can be found on the Hough Mill site at Swannington near the Califat Colliery site. A life-sized horse gin has been built on the Hough Mill site and craters can be seen in the ground, where the medieval villagers dug out their allocation of coal.

The seam is at ground level in Swannington, but gradually gets deeper between Swannington and the deepest reserves at Bagworth; consequently, it was not until mining technology advanced that shafts were sunk in the district now known as Coalville, beginning with Whitwick in 1824 and at Snibston in 1831.

Deep coal mining was pioneered by local engineer William Stenson who sank the Long Lane (Whitwick) Colliery on a relative&#x27;s farm land in the 1820s. In doing so, Stenson ignored an old miner&#x27;s dictum of the day, &quot;No coal below stone&quot;, and sank his shaft through a layer of &#x27;Greenstone&#x27; or &#x27;Whinstone&#x27; to the coal below. This effectively opened up the &#x27;concealed coalfield.&#x27; This was followed by the mine at Snibston, by George Stephenson in the early 1830s, and Stephenson was also responsible for the creation of the Leicester and Swannington Railway at the same time.

Quarrying, textile and engineering industries, such as railway wagon production, also grew in the town during the 19th century. Stenson is sometimes described as &#x27;the Father of Coalville&#x27;.

Coal-mining came to an end in Coalville during the 1980s. Six collieries – Snibston, Desford, Whitwick, Ellistown, South Leicester and Bagworth – closed in and around Coalville in an eight-year period from 1983 to 1991, resulting in about five thousand men being made redundant.

The disused colliery at Snibston was regenerated into Snibston Discovery Park but controversially closed in 2015 by Leicestershire County Council. The area formerly occupied by Whitwick Colliery has been redeveloped as the Whitwick Business Park and which incorporates a Morrison&#x27;s supermarket. There is also a small memorial garden here, established in memory of 35 men who died in the Whitwick Colliery Disaster of 1898, which occurred as a result of an underground fire, though the etched metal plaque commemorating this terrible calamity has (of 2014) been removed from the large granite memorial boulder.

===Leicester and Swannington Railway===

The Leicester and Swannington Railway – Leicestershire&#x27;s first railway – opened in 1832, reaching Coalville in 1833, and had a small station at Long Lane (now High Street) in Coalville. Snibston Colliery opened in 1833. The railway was extended to Burton upon Trent in 1845, placing Coalville on an important route between Burton and Leicester. Heavy coal traffic encouraged the construction of further railways linking Coalville to Nuneaton and, later, Loughborough, over the Charnwood Forest Railway.

In the 20th century the railways to Nuneaton and Loughborough were closed and dismantled. Passenger services were withdrawn from the Leicester to Burton line in September 1964, but it remains open for goods traffic.

After 1993 there was a plan to restore passenger trains on the Leicester-Burton line through Coalville as an extension of Leicestershire&#x27;s Ivanhoe Line. In 2013 a passenger train made a very rare pass through because of a cut off elsewhere and in the same year, a group known as &#x27;The Campaign for Better Transport&#x27; petitioned for the freight track to be upgraded to mark the 50th anniversary of the network cuts introduced by Dr Beeching. The Leicester to Burton track was one of ten lines that this group called to be re-opened, with a proposal for it to be renamed the National Forest line. However, a spokesman for the County Council said, &quot;We have been unable to reintroduce Leicester to Burton passenger trains because the costs of about £50 million to upgrade the route and £4 million per year to operate services do not represent good value for money.&quot;

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Coalville, at district and county level: North West Leicestershire District Council and Leicestershire County Council. The district council meets at Stenson House on London Road in Coalville.

===Administrative history===
When the development of Coalville began in the 19th century, the area straddled the four parishes or townships of Whitwick, Hugglescote and Donington, Snibston and Swannington. The parish of Whitwick was made a local government district in 1864, which therefore had authority over the north-eastern parts of Coalville which lay within that parish.

In 1892 the Whitwick local government district was abolished and replaced by a larger Coalville district, covering the whole parish of Whitwick and parts of the neighbouring parishes of Hugglescote and Donington, Ravenstone with Snibston and Swannington.

Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894. Also in 1894, the parishes in the area were reorganised to stop parishes straddling district boundaries, after which there were three parishes in the urban district: a reduced Whitwick parish to the north, a reduced Hugglescote and Donington parish in the south, and a new Coalville parish in the centre. These three were urban parishes and so did not have parish councils of their own but were instead directly administered by the Coalville Urban District Council. In 1936 Thringstone was absorbed into the urban district, alongside boundary changes with other neighbouring parishes. At the same time the parishes within the urban district were merged into a single parish of Coalville.
The urban district council built itself a headquarters called Municipal Offices on London Road in 1934, designed by Herbert Langman.

Coalville Urban District was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the new district of North West Leicestershire. No successor parish was created for the former urban district, and so it became an unparished area. New parishes have since been created from parts of the old urban district, being Ellistown and Battleflat in 2002 and Hugglescote and Donington le Heath and Whitwick, both created in 2011. Thringstone and the central part of Coalville remain unparished.

The old Municipal Offices were extended to become the headquarters of North West Leicestershire District Council, and were renamed Stenson House after Coalville&#x27;s founder, William Stenson, whose house had stood on the site. Since 2012, the building has also served as the town&#x27;s register office.

==Economy==
Within thirty years of the town&#x27;s birth as a result of the collieries, many additional industries became established within the town, such as flour milling, brick making, engineering and the manufacture of elastic web.

During the twentieth century, Coalville was home to Palitoy, a toy manufacturer that made Action Man, Action Force, Tiny Tears, Pippa, Tressy, Merlin, Star Wars figures and the Care Bears. The company was founded by Alfred Edward Pallett in 1909 to produce celluloid and fancy goods. Their first toy was in 1920 and the first doll in 1925. The Palitoy site was closed in 1994.

Aggregate Industries has its headquarters at Bardon Hill Quarry and is one of the five largest construction material suppliers in the UK. The company was originally established in 1858, though an early reference to a granite quarry at Bardon Hill appeared in 1622, in William Burton&#x27;s &quot;Description of Leicestershire&quot;.

TEREX Pegson Limited is a UK manufacturer of mobile crushing machines, and is part of the Terex Corporation. Pegson is headquartered in Coalville, with a distribution centre for North America in Louisville, Kentucky. The manufacturing plant has been located for many years on Mammoth Street, off the Whitwick Road and the company is able to trace its origins to the company of Samuel Pegg and Son, which was originally set up on Alexander Street, Leicester in 1830, when its main concern was connected with hosiery machinery.

Tulip Foods (formerly Belvoir Bacon) on Mantle Lane was incorporated as a limited company on 1 July 1954, having started about twenty years previously, as a slaughterhouse supplying pork products to a local shop in Coalville owned by the Bloor family. By the 1960s the factory had begun to distribute its products nationally. The factory became known locally as &quot;Piggy Bloor&#x27;s&quot;. The Belvoir name was replaced by Tulip in 2003. In 2023 the factory was closed down and its future is not known.

Numerous business parks and industrial estates have been established in and around Coalville following the decline of coal-mining and allied industries. Calder Colours, based on the Coalville Business Park, are manufacturers of art and craft materials. In 2014 this company produced the hundreds of litres of red top coat and terracotta base coat paint for the commemorative art installation at the Tower of London entitled &quot;Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red&quot;, marking the centenary of the outbreak of World War I.

In October 2016, Amazon opened in Coalville its biggest fulfilment Centre in the United Kingdom (named BHX2). Reportedly occupying an area equivalent to 19 football fields, the centre employs hundreds of citizens in the Leicestershire region and is operational twenty four hours a day.

==Transport==
Arriva Midlands are the main operator for services from Coalville. Its buses operate to Leicester, Loughborough and Swadlincote. Roberts Travel Group operate service 159 to Hinckley and 125 to Leicester and Castle Donington. Trent Barton operate the Skylink bus service to East Midlands Airport and Nottingham.

The nearest passenger railway station is Loughborough, about northeast of Coalville. There have been calls to reinstate passenger services through the town on the Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line. However, following Leicestershire County Council&#x27;s 2009 report citing construction costs of £50 million and a large operational subsidy, the scheme was dropped, prompting outcry from proponents.

==Religion==
In the 2011 census, the electoral ward of Coalville had 5988 inhabitants with religious affiliation as follows: 60.1% Christian, 32.4% No religion, 0.6% Hindu, 0.3% Buddhist, 0.2% Muslim, 0.1% Agnostic, 0.1% Sikh. The town has a rich and diverse history of Christian places of worship. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, numerous non-conformist chapels were established, some of which gave rise to break-away factions. Following the decline in the membership of traditional non-conformist societies, the town has seen the establishment of numerous evangelical free churches in more recent years. An official town guide, produced by the Coalville Urban District Council, circa 1968, has proved to be a useful source in chronicling the development and histories of early religious groups. The Anglican, Evangelical, Roman Catholic and &#x27;non-conformist&#x27; churches in the district co-operate in an ecumenical alliance known as Coalville Christian Church Unity. The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Spiritualist Church in the town are unconnected with this movement.

===Church of England===
Coalville was in earlier times divided between the parishes of Snibston and Whitwick. The parish of Christ Church, Coalville, was established in the mid-19th century. Since 1926 Coalville has been in the Diocese of Leicester; from 1539 to 1926 it was in the Diocese of Peterborough.

====Parish church====

Coalville&#x27;s parish church, Christ Church on London Road, was built between 1836 and 1838. The architect was H. I. Stevens of Derby. In 1853, a chancel was added, making the building cruciform, and the church was restored between 1894 and 1895. Vestries for the clergy and choir were erected on the north side of the chancel in 1936.

The building is a plain and routine example of Early English style revival, comprising nave, transepts, chancel and western tower. The nave is fairly unusual in that its north and south aisles are not separated from the nave by arcades. The tower contains four bells, played on a clavier and has embattled parapets; access to the church is via the main west door, located in the ground floor stage of the tower. The local historian, Edgar Hawthorn, claims that construction of the church was funded by George Stephenson, though this assertion has been called into question by more recent historians.

The tower contained a single bell until 1936, when a further three bells were presented by Dr Francis E. Knowles of America. Dr Knowles had ordered these bells from the foundry of John Taylor at Loughborough, but in the meantime, the church in America was destroyed by a tornado. Through the influence of the then vicar, the Reverend W. A. J. Martyr, Dr Knowles (originally of Melbourne in Derbyshire) was persuaded to present them to Christ Church, Coalville.

The church houses a brass memorial plaque to the victims of the Whitwick Colliery Disaster (1898) and the gravestone of James Stephenson, who came here through the influence of his brother, George Stephenson, the engineer, to work as an official at the Snibston Colliery.
There is a memorial to the fallen of the parish of both World War I and II in the Lady Chapel. This is in the form of a reredos behind the chapel altar. In 1859, an Act of Parliament decreed that &#x27;for the protection of the public health&#x27;, no further burials should take place in the church yard, &#x27;with the exception of the part of the ground on the south of the church, in which no burial shall take place, except in brick graves, in which each coffin shall be separately entombed in an air-tight manner&#x27;. The same legislation also ordered that &#x27;burials be wholly discontinued in the General Baptist Chapel Burial-ground&#x27;, which was located just a short distance away from the church, near the present day council offices.

The small churchyard contains the grave of Amos Clarke, who, although blind from the age of eight days, was organist at Christ Church for some fifty years. Following his death in 1930, he was buried on the south side of the church as near to the organ as possible – at his own request.

The longest serving vicar of Christ Church was the Reverend William Gardner, who held the living for thirty-three years. The east window was installed as a memorial to Gardner, his wife and daughter.

====Vicars====
====All Saints&#x27; Mission Church====
Due to the rapid growth of the town in the 19th century, a mission church known as &quot;All Saints&#x27;&quot; was erected on Ashby Road in 1895, on a site given by Messrs T. and J. Jones of Coalville. This was served by the clergy of the parish church.

====St Mary&#x27;s, Snibston====

St Mary&#x27;s, Snibston is an ancient parish church set in a rural location close to Coalville. The church building is notable for being very small, no longer than twenty-four feet, comprising a nave and chancel in one. The fabric is mainly medieval, though the current lancet windows were installed in 1847. The foundations of a tower were discovered in 1930. Until a Coalville parish (the Christ Church parish) was created, Snibston parish covered much of the south-westerly part of the area that is now Coalville.

====St David&#x27;s, Broom Leys====
St David&#x27;s (Church of England, founded in 1933) is in a northerly suburb of Coalville. The present building was built in the 1960s.

===Baptists===
There were, at one time, three different Baptist churches within the town of Coalville – belonging to General Baptists, Strict Baptists and Particular Baptists.

The General Baptist chapel in Coalville was built on land provided by the Whitwick Colliery Company and occupied a site close to the present day council offices, at the junction of London Road and Whitwick Road. This church, which became known as the London Road Baptist Chapel, became the first permanent place of worship in Coalville when services began in 1836. Built at a cost of £560, the chapel had 600 sittings and a Sunday School attached. For many years after its demolition, the junction on which it had stood was still referred to as &#x27;Chapel Corner&#x27;.

Following the chapel&#x27;s closure, the congregation transferred to a new premises at Greenhill known as the Charnborough Road Baptist Church, which was registered for solemnising marriages on 15 March 1955. This church is still in use and is now known as the Greenhill Community Church, being affiliated to the Baptist Union.

In 1852, a society of Strict Baptists built a chapel known as &quot;Cave Adullam&quot; on the opposite side of the road to the General Baptist Chapel on London Road. According to local writer, Elizabeth Hewes, this was erected by William Stenson – the founder of Whitwick Colliery – who was a staunch baptist, as a more &quot;select place of worship&quot; for himself and his wife. Stenson lived just a very short distance away, also on the London Road, on a site which is today marked by a brass plaque. The local historian, Dennis Baker does not mention Stenson&#x27;s involvement with this chapel, attributing its formation to a break-away movement from the General Baptist chapel as a result of doctrinal differences. Stenson was undoubtedly a pioneer of the Baptist mission in Coalville however, and his grave can be found in the old Baptist cemetery off Grange Road, Hugglescote.

This chapel was still flourishing in 1907, when it was redecorated, with &quot;Strict Baptist&quot; newly painted on the door. It was probably this chapel that was the one referred to as a &quot;Calvinist chapel&quot; in Kelly&#x27;s Directory of 1881. Another source has it as a &quot;Calvinistic&quot; chapel.
The building still exists and is now occupied by the Balti Tower Indian restaurant and an oriental food store. For many years after its closure, part of the building was occupied by &quot;Kemp&#x27;s grocery store&quot;. The stone plaque, bearing the name, &quot;Cave Adullam&quot; can still be seen set above the frontage; this term has its origins in the Bible (I Samuel, 22:I).

In 1879, further doctrinal differences led to 149 members of the General Baptist Chapel being erased from their communion.
Seventy three of these individuals then formed themselves into a Particular Baptist Chapel and went on to build the Ebeneezer Baptist Church on Ashby Road, which was completed in 1881. Whilst the church was being built, services were conducted in an old wagon repair shop. Structural alterations and additions were made to the building in 1908 and instead of two entrances to the church, one main entrance was made, as it is today. The church once played a prominent part in the musical life of the town, and it was here that the Snibston Colliery Miner&#x27;s Welfare Silver Prize Band was formed.

===Congregationalist (United Reformed Church)===
Congregationalism would appear to have been the first Protestant non-conformist religion active in the Coalville district.

Following Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, the re-establishment of the bishops, and Parliament&#x27;s attempt in 1662 to impose a single form of religious observance throughout England (the Act of Uniformity 1662), the vicar of Ravenstone (John Shuttlewood or Sittlewood) was removed from office in 1660, the vicar of Whitwick (John Bennett) was removed from office in 1662 and William Sheffield (a former rector of Ibstock, but who had moved to Stoke Golding where he was a curate) was suspended on 13 October 1662. All three became Nonconformist or Dissenting preachers. Shuttlewood and Bennett were both later imprisoned for Nonconformity.

The moated old Bardon Hall at Bardon Park became a place of Dissenting worship, and was registered as such after persecution of Dissent had eased. After the events known as the Glorious Revolution (1688) and the Act of Toleration 1689, the owner of Bardon Hall and Park built the Bardon Park chapel or meetinghouse at the gate of his estate, as a place for non-conforming worship.

The Bardon Park Chapel, situated about from Coalville, is a Grade II Listed building, widely regarded as being the oldest non-conformist place of worship in Leicestershire. Built in about 1694, the chapel was affiliated to the Congregational Union from about 1830. In 1972, the Congregationalists united nationally with the Presbyterians to form the United Reformed Church. The &quot;Bardon Chapel&quot; thus serves as the modern day United Reformed Church for the communities of Coalville and North West Leicestershire.

Around 1800, the then minister at the Bardon Park Chapel opened a chapel at Donington-le-Heath. This building was relatively short-lived and was eventually demolished. Its exact location is unknown. From the 1840s until circa 1870, the Bardon Park Chapel operated a day-school at Bardon Park, in the hall to the rear of the chapel. This school was affiliated to the British and Foreign School Society. (BFSS schools were often known as &quot;British Schools&quot;, distinguishing them from the &quot;National Schools&quot; affiliated to the Church of England). A painted alphabet board on the wall of the old schoolroom at Bardon Park Chapel dates from the 1840s. 

Around 1900, the Bardon Park Congregational Chapel became concerned that it was not sufficiently influencing the spiritual life of the town of Coalville and opened a new chapel in the town. This was &quot;an iron building which used to stand on what is now the flower plot at the corner of Broom Leys Road and London Road&quot; and the building was also used as a place of worship by a society of United Methodists, before they built their own church on the London Road in 1910. A house called &quot;Hazeldine Villa&quot;, adjacent to the iron building, was the residence of the Congregationalist minister. The mission proved to be a short lived venture however, as Hazeldine and the iron chapel were sold off in 1909.

===Free churches===

Coalville Evangelical Church, is an independent church affiliated with the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches, located on Belvoir Road, having taken over from a now defunct Open Brethren congregation on the site.

‘’’Living Rock Church’’’ is an evangelical church which meets on the first Sunday of each month at Rothley House (the former Palitoy factory off Jackson Street. Their website is www.livingrock.church

The New Life Church is an evangelical free church on Margaret Street, which occupies a premises which was formerly a working men&#x27;s club.

A Pentecostal church, &quot;Full Gospel Mission&quot;, affiliated with the Elim Pentecostal Churches of Great Britain, meets in a building established in James Street in the late 1950s. It was extended and upgraded in the 1980s.

The Yesterday, Today and Forever Church is an independent evangelical church which was established in the former Salvation Army Hall on Gutteridge Street.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===

Jehovah&#x27;s Winesses have a modern &#x27;Kingdom Hall&#x27; on Albert Road, replacing one which formerly stood on Ashby Road. The building comprises a brick built rectangular hall, with a gabled entrance lobby on the west side, which is faced with stone ashlar and within which is a castellated brick façade containing the main door. 

===Methodism===
There were, at one time, three different Methodist factions active within the town of Coalville – the Primitive Methodists, the United Methodists and the Wesleyan Methodists – and each had its own chapel. All of these societies united nationally in 1932 and their buildings became known simply as &#x27;Methodist Churches&#x27;. The three Methodist congregations all eventually amalgamated locally and were assimilated within the church in Marlborough Square, which is the present day Coalville Methodist Church.

Another Methodist faction – the Wesleyan Reform Methodists – did not enter into the national Methodist Union of 1932 and this organisation still has an independent church on the outskirts of the town, at New Swannington (at the Whitwick end of Thornborough Road), which was built in 1906. There are also Wesleyan Reform chapels in the nearby townships of Ellistown and Ibstock.

The Primitive Methodists originally had a place of worship on Ashby Road, and also a Sunday School, in a building that later became known as the &#x27;Snibstone Band Room&#x27;. This was used from 1832 until 1861 and was eventually sold to the Baptists and is now the site of the Ebenezer Baptist Church.

In 1861, a Primitive Methodist Church was built next to the railway crossing on Belvoir Road. This structure still exists, with lancet windows still visible at the rear of the premises as one walks along the footpath which follows the route of the old railway line. This church was in turn replaced by a new building in Marlborough Square in 1903, and which is now known as the Marlborough Square Methodist Church. This was built to seat 600 people, with school hall, vestries and classrooms.

The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel building (erected in 1881) still exists on Belvoir Road and is now used as a community resource, known as the Marlene Reid Centre, named in commemoration of Marlene Reid of Whitwick who died in 1986, and whose own disability inspired her to pioneer local voluntary services, also earning her Leicestershire&#x27;s &#x27;Woman of the Year&#x27; award in 1983.
The United Methodists had a church on London Road. This was founded in 1910 on land acquired by the United Methodist Church in Loughborough. Following the Methodist national union in 1932, the London Road Church continued to be served from Loughborough until 1943, when the chapel was transferred to the Coalville circuit and was served by a minister who lived opposite, at No. 76 London Road
. The church was once known for its lovely garden, but closed some years ago and has since been demolished, the site subsequently being used for new housing. 

===Plymouth Brethren===
A congregation is recorded meeting in a room in Hugglescote in the 1880s and 1890s, and by the turn of the century in a room in Coalville. This may have been the same meeting place, as the boundaries of Coalville had been extended through the local government reforms. A permanent meeting place was built on Belvoir Road to house an &quot;Open&quot; Brethren congregation; named in typically utilitarian fashion as &quot;Belvoir Road Hall&quot;. Its congregation steadily reduced during the 1960s and 70&#x27;s, becoming unsustainable and eventually selling the building to Coalville Evangelical Church (see above).

===Roman Catholicism===
The neighbouring parish of Whitwick was a focal point in the Roman Catholic revival early in the nineteenth century due to the zealous missionary work instigated by Ambrose de Lisle of Gracedieu Manor, a mission which eventually spread to encompass the new town of Coalville.
Until 1887, the small community of Catholics residing in Coalville had to travel to Whitwick to celebrate Mass. In that year, Mass was first celebrated in a private house on Ashby Road and services were subsequently held in a local dance hall and later in a theatre owned by Mr Charles Tyler. After a few years, Mr Edwin de Lisle offered to build a temporary church, entirely at his own expense, on a site on Highfields Street, which had previously been acquired by Father Matthew O&#x27;Reilly, the parish priest at Whitwick. This was an oblong building of corrugated iron.

In the year 1900, again through the generosity of Mr de Lisle, a new church was erected on the site and which was opened by Edward Bagshawe, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nottingham in the presence of a large gathering of the general public. This church was built of simple pitch pine, though had a highly decorative interior. Later enlarged and furnished by the Reverend Joseph Degen, it was dedicated to Saint Saviour (San Salvador) under the title of the Transfiguration. The high altar in this church had formerly belonged to the reformatory school for boys, which was at one time connected with Mount Saint Bernard&#x27;s Abbey and there are references to this altar in &#x27;Household Words&#x27; by Charles Dickens.

In 1913, Coalville became a Roman Catholic parish in its own right, under the guidance of Father Joseph Degen, a local activist who championed the cause of the local mining community. Under his guidance, the Catholic community grew substantially and in 1956 a church hall was erected on Ibstock Road in Ellistown, to relieve the congestion in the church of Saint Saviour&#x27;s.

In June 1961, the modern day Saint Wilfrid of York Catholic Church by Desmond Williams was built on London Road, next to the Coalville Park. The church is noted as having some architectural merit, and preserving much of its original character. The western facade of the church is clad in green Swithland slate with a carved stone statue of St Wilfrid in the gable by Michael Clark, and the side walls comprise a series of shallow curved bays with two tiers of segment-headed windows.

Another important development within the Coalville Roman Catholic community was the founding of the Convent of the Poor Clares, on Forest Road, close by the railway bridge &quot;where the Sisters dedicate themselves to the education of the children of Saint Wilfred&#x27;s Parish&quot;. The present school was opened and formally blessed by the Right Reverend Bishop McGuiness in May 1976. The Cistercian monastery of Mount Saint Bernard Abbey is also close to the town, on the fringe of Charnwood Forest.

====Roman Catholic Priests of Coalville====


===Salvationist===
The Salvation Army formerly had a purpose-built hall on Gutteridge Street, though due to a decline in its membership this building was recently sold off and is now used by an evangelical free church. A small group of people formerly associated with the Gutteridge Street church now meet for worship on Sunday afternoons at the Saint Wilfred of York Roman Catholic Church in the town. 

===Spiritualist===
There is also the Spiritualists&#x27; National Union on Bridge Road. The Bridge Road building was formerly a Unitarian chapel.

===Unitarian and Free Christian===
A Unitarian hall was opened on Bridge Road in September 1908 and functioned until 1946. A Spiritualist congregation subsequently took over the building. 

==Education==
The town has a Further and Higher Education College, Stephenson College, now known as Stephenson Campus which operates approximately 800 different courses in academic, vocational and industry-specific subjects. The college moved from former mining college buildings near the town centre of what is now Adam Morris Way to the purpose built building located beside the A511. Part of the campus was inhabited by Stephenson Studio School, which opened to students in September 2011, and catered for ages 14–18. The school closed in 2024. 

The Castle Rock School (formerly Castle Rock High School and King Edward VII Science and Sport College) caters for 11–18-year-olds, providing GCSEs, A-Levels and a number of vocational courses. The Newbridge School (formerly Newbridge High School) caters for 11–18-year-olds, with a student population of around 600. It celebrated its centenary as a school building in 2009, having originally opened as the Coalville Grammar School.

The town has a number of primary schools including All Saints Church of England Primary School, Belvoirdale Primary School, Broom Leys Primary School, Warren Hills Primary School and St Clare&#x27;s Catholic Primary School.

In the nineteenth century, a day-school operated in the premises of the Bardon Park Chapel (see Other places of worship/Congregationalist, below) from the 1840s until around the time of the Elementary Education Act 1870. This day-school was affiliated to the British and Foreign School Society.

==Museums==
Snibston Discovery Museum, was located off Ashby Road and was built on part of the site of the former Snibston Colliery. It featured interactive exhibits, an 0-4-0ST steam locomotive, a fashion gallery and more. The museum focused on technology and design and how it affects everyday life.

Early 2015, Conservative-controlled Leicestershire County Council announced that the museum would be closed due to its £900,000 annual running cost. The cabinet member for museums, Councillor Richard Blunt, said that it was hoped a smaller mining heritage museum would replace the existing museum. He also asserted that the country park would be preserved and expanded and that the Century Theatre would remain open.

The Discovery Museum closed on 31 July 2015.
It was reported that the council had dropped the idea of having a mining heritage museum to replace Snibston and had insisted that there were no long-term plans for the site&#x27;s redevelopment.
Demolition of the main hall commenced in March 2016.

Donington le Heath Manor House Museum is based on a medieval manor house dating back to about 1280 and which was a family home for 700 years. The site was acquired by the local authority in the late twentieth century having fallen into a state of disrepair, and was subsequently redeveloped into a museum. The house is believed to have once been owned by Sir Everard Digby, a member of the group responsible for the Gunpowder Plot of 1605.

==Culture==
The Coalville Male Voice Choir, (Formerly known as the Coalville and District Male Voice Choir), was formed in 1944. Paul Hayward is only the sixth musical director in the choir&#x27;s seventy four-year history, having succeeded Dr Georgie Lorimer, Cynthia Moseley, Aubrey Ward, Les Anderson and Harry Toon. The town is also home to the Broom Leys Choral Society.

The town also has a tradition of brass band history and is home to the Desford Colliery Band, founded in 1898. Their club, known as &#x27;The Brass House&#x27;, is located on Albert Road.

The Coalville Amateur Operatic Society was formed in 1919, and has been staging operas, modern musicals and concerts in the Coalville area ever since. The society currently meets for rehearsals on Monday evenings at The Brass House, Albert Road, and on Thursday evenings at The Methodist Church in Malborough Square, both venues located near the town centre.

The Old Adult School Hall and Theatre on Bridge Road is the home of the Coalville Drama Group, formerly known as the Coalville Adult School Drama Group. The Drama Group has been presenting plays, dramas, comedies, pantomimes and other productions since the mid fifties. The Drama Group meets on Tuesday and Friday evenings. The Drama Group enjoys a long and unbroken history of presenting plays at the Hall, four times a year.

===Gastronomy===
Historian William George Hoskins had little complimentary to say about Coalville in his &quot;Shell Guide&quot; (1970), aside from remarking that &quot;excellent pork pies&quot; were produced there. A food and drink festival was held in the town in November 2013.

==Media==
Established in 1893, the Coalville Times is a weekly newspaper that covers the town and the whole of North West Leicestershire, as well as areas of South Derbyshire and Hinckley and Bosworth. It is situated on Bridge Road, Coalville, where the Ashby Times and Swadlincote Times are also produced.

Television signals can only be received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter which broadcast BBC West Midlands and ITV Central (West) from Birmingham. However, BBC East Midlands and ITV Central (East) are also received through cable and satellite television such as Freesat and Sky.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leicester on 104.9 FM, Smooth East Midlands on 101.4 and 106.6 FM, Capital Midlands on 102.8 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands on 106.0 FM, Hits Radio East Midlands on DAB, Fosse FM and Carillon Radio which broadcast to hospital patients at the Coalville Hospital in the town. 

Launched on 14 November 2009, Hermitage FM was the community broadcaster for North West Leicestershire. It had a community coffee lounge based in its premises in Memorial Square. It was announced in early 2024 that both the radio station and coffee lounge will close.

==Sport==

Coalville Town Football Club – known as &#x27;The Ravens&#x27; currently play in the Southern League Premier Division Central. In 2010–11, Coalville reached the FA Vase final becoming the first Leicestershire team to achieve a place in the final. Coalville have reached the 1st round of the FA Cup on two occasions in 2004 and 2022.

The Coalville Rugby Football Club was founded in 1902 and has a modern clubhouse off Hall Lane, Whitwick, replacing one that had previously stood on Broom Leys Road.

The District Council&#x27;s Hermitage Leisure Centre off Silver Street, Whitwick, was officially opened on 30 April 1981 by Olympic athlete Sebastian Coe. Facilities included four squash courts, a multi-purpose room with weight training equipment and a bar. Sebastian Coe returned in 1987 to open a further phase, incorporating a multi-purpose sports hall and health suite. External facilities included a floodlit all-weather play area, fishing lake and sports pitches.

In February 2022, the council announced the opening of a £22.5 million flagship leisure development, the Whitwick and Coalville Leisure Centre, based around an eight-lane, 25-metre competition swimming pool. The old Hermitage Leisure Centre building and surrounding playing fields are to close, with the future usage undecided.

A fishing lake occupied the site of a former clay quarry which filled with water after disuse for some years following the demise of the adjacent brick-making works, all trace of which has now disappeared following the development of the Hermitage sports complex.

The Coalville Greyhound Stadium existed on Belvoir Road from 1927 until 1990. The greyhound racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) but it was a popular venue within the flapping (nickname for independent tracks) fraternity despite being unaffiliated. Afghan hound races also took place here.

Leicestershire County Cricket Club have played first-class cricket at three venues in Coalville: the Fox and Goose Ground, the Town Ground and Snibston Colliery Ground.

==Political history==
Traditionally, district of Coalville was a Labour Party stronghold, and until the 1990s, Labour held 36 out of the 40 seats on the district council, with its industrial and coal-mining heritage seen as a deterministic factor in its political profile. In the early twenty first century however, the localised political landscape changed drastically, with control of the district council ceding to the Conservatives. In 2015, the council&#x27;s website shows that there are currently 20 Conservative councillors compared to 16 for Labour and 1 for the Liberal Democrats, with 1 member sitting as an independent. In 2009, the British National Party gained its first seat on the Leicestershire County Council, when their candidate, Graham Partner, took the Coalville seat from the Labour Party with a majority of 86. Labour regained the seat in the council elections of 2013 however, with Partner (who had by then defected to the British Democrats) coming in fourth place and UKIP coming second.

Election result for the division of Coalville – Leicestershire County Council, 2 May 2013

Election Result for the Division of Coalville – Leicestershire County Council, 4 June 2009

Coalville has been part of two parliamentary constituencies since the end of the World War I], which has seen the election of representatives from all three traditional political parties. From 1918 until 1983, Coalville had been part of the Bosworth parliamentary constituency, which was represented by Liberal, Labour and Conservative members of parliament throughout this period. Since 1983, Coalville has lain within the parliamentary constituency of North West Leicestershire, which has been represented by both Conservative and Labour members of parliament (MPs), the current MP being Amanda Hack of the Labour Party.

Coalville voted to leave in the 2016 European Union membership referendum.

==Buildings and landmarks==
Coalville has few listed buildings. The central core of the town is characterised by streets of homogeneous terraced housing, built toward the end of the nineteenth century and during the early part of the twentieth century, with detached housing concentrated on the London Road and Forest Road.

In June 2014, it was reported that consideration was being given by the local district council to the designation of the Coalville town centre as a conservation area, something which English Heritage has encouraged. In a letter to the council, English Heritage stated, &quot;Coalville is a good example of the type of commercial and industrial settlement that grew up rapidly in the 19th century following the discovery of coal, but which in Leicestershire is somewhat unusual and it has a number of 19th and 20th century gems, such as the Rex Cinema&quot;.

A well-known landmark at the centre of the town is the clock tower, a war memorial in memory of Coalville residents who gave their lives in the 20th century&#x27;s two world wars: The memorial clock tower was designed by Henry Collings and built by W Moss Ltd in 1925 at a cost of £2,250. It was designed to replace the first cenotaph to The Fallen which had been installed in the boundary wall of the railway station in 1919. The memorial clock was officially opened by Mrs Booth of Gracedieu Manor at a memorial service on 31 October 1925. Ten thousand people attended and the Coalville Company of the 5th Leicestershire Regiment led a procession, headed by the regimental band. A procession of ex-servicemen and a detachment of C squadron of the Leicestershire Yeomanry marched from Whitwick and another party of ex-servicemen, including 22 surviving members of the &#x27;first fifty&#x27; was led from the Fox and Goose public house by The Hugglescote and Ellistown Band. The tower rises 68 feet above pavement level and is a Grade II listed building. The building was admired by the architectural critic and historian, Nikolaus Pevsner.

In addition to the clock tower war memorial, three other buildings in Coalville have been given Grade II listed status; the parish church of Christ Church, the former Railway Hotel and the Castle Rock Sixth Form College, formerly a country house, attributed to Pugin.

Broom Leys House (now known as Broom Leys School) is possibly the best example of a wealthy Victorian&#x27;s house in the area. The house was built on the site of an eighteenth-century farmhouse purchased by William Whetstone in 1845 and designed by the eminent architect, Joseph Goddard. Whetstone was the owner of Ibstock Colliery and a former Lord Mayor of Leicester. In 1908, the house was bought by Horace Rendall Mansfield, the Member of Parliament for Spalding, Lincolnshire, subsequently being purchased by the Whitwick Colliery Company in 1911. In 1914, it was loaned from the mining company to house Belgian refugees during the First World War and in 1915, the house started to be used as a hospital for the war wounded. Following the First World War, the house became a school and is now one of the largest primary schools in Leicestershire.

Coalville Grammar School was built on Forest Road in 1909 and replaced the Harley Charity Grammar School at Osgathorpe. This imposing building was built at a cost of £7,145 by J.E Johnson of Loughborough and a &#x27;Harley Memorial Tablet&#x27; was unveiled inside the building. The first headmaster was Mr L Storr-Best, D. Lit, M.A. Following the transferral of the grammar school to a new site at Warren Hills in the 1960s, the building became the home of Newbridge High School. An arson attempt nearly destroyed the building in 1984 and led to reconstruction of the upper storey and a new bell turret.

The former Belvoir Road Co-operative Store is a three-storey building which stands as an expression of interwar social and economic confidence in the town, being the organisation&#x27;s fourth town centre premises, opened in 1916 and designed by Thomas Ignatius McCarthy. Despite alterations to its ground floor and a modern addition at its southern end, the building maintains a significant presence in the street scene with its brick and faience triple gabled frontage.

The former Co-operative Bakery near Mantle Lane is a large three-storey stone and brick building, built by the Coalville and District Working Men&#x27;s Co-operative Society to provide bread and confectionery to the local district. Built in 1930, this is currently derelict. A section of the old bakery was the Palitoy Consumer Services Department during the 70s.

Standing a short distance from the old Co-operative Bakery, on the corner of Market Street and Wolsey Road are the former East Midland Housing Association Offices, which was provided with a third storey extension, circa 1990. Founded in 1946 as a traditional housing association by a group of homeless ex-servicemen with an initial capital of just £39 and 10 shillings, this organisation has since transferred its headquarters to Memorial House on the Whitwick Business Park and is now a huge concern known as the East Midlands Group, acting as landlord for 18,000 homes.
The former Leicestershire Miners&#x27; Association building at No. 8 Bakewell Street was built between 1926 and 1927 at a cost of £4000 Founded as the Coalville and District Miners&#x27; Association in 1887, this became the Leicestershire Miners&#x27; Association in about 1907 and held its meetings in a variety of venues around the district until the Bakewell Street premises was built. In 1945, this building became the headquarters for the Leicestershire Area of the National Union of Mineworkers. It is now home to a company called Stirling Solutions, which produces software for the road haulage industry.

The Mantle Lane Signal Box has stood for more than a century overlooking the railway bridge on north side of Memorial Square. Opened in 1910, this is a &#x27;Midland Railway Type 4c box&#x27;, fitted with a 28 lever frame. Another signal box, dating from 1907, and which had stood at the crossing on Hotel Street, was dismantled several years ago and re-erected in the grounds of the Snibston Discovery Park.
The Market Hall, housing the town&#x27;s general market, was constructed in 1975 at a cost of approximately £300,000. According to a contemporary publication, &quot;the construction of the twin hyperbolic paraboloid main roofs is unique&quot;. Situated next to the railway line, close to the site of the original station, it has been suggested that the Market Hall would make an ideal modern station should the railway be re-opened to passenger services. 

The Marlene Reid Centre on the corner of Belvoir Road and Melbourne Street was erected in 1881 as a Wesleyan Methodist chapel. This is a neat red brick structure, with rounded windows in the classical style forming an attractive feature in its upper storey frontage.

The Methodist Church in Marlborough Square is a good example of design by the local architect, Thomas Ignatius McCarthy, and together with the art deco cinema houses and former Lloyds bank forms a group of characterful buildings, though their impact is possibly detracted by the use of the square as a public car park. The Methodist Church, built as a Primitive Methodist chapel in 1903, contains a gallery extending around the interior, accessed by two polygonal towers either side of a large, four-light lancet widow on the frontal facade.

The Miners&#x27; Memorial Statue is a bronze sculpture situated on the site of the old railway station and which was officially unveiled by David Taylor MP and the Right Reverend William Down, Assistant Bishop of Leicester, in 1998 to mark the one hundredth anniversary of the Whitwick Colliery Disaster, in which thirty five men and boys lost their lives. The inscription reads: &quot;This memorial is dedicated to all miners of Leicestershire who gave their lives winning the coal&quot;. The statue was sculpted by Judith Holmes Drewry. A measure of criticism has been aired by some of the former mining community that the representation of a man, standing with a raised pickaxe, does not reflect the true conditions of the narrow seams of the district, in which men would have more typically been forced to hew coal from a prostrate or kneeling position.

The Mother and Child is a bronze sculpture standing outside the public library, and which won the Sir Otto Beit Prize for 1963. The statue is by Robert John Royden Thomas and represents a mother looking forward, with her child looking behind her at a string bag she holds, which contains lumps of coal, a bobbin, books, a baby doll and another item, representing the mining, elastic, web weaving, toy manufacturing (Palitoy) and other industries of the town&#x27;s past. The sculpture was unveiled on 11 October 1963 by Colonel P H Lloyd, Chairman of Leicestershire County Council, and stood in the New Broadway Shopping Centre until it was moved to its present location on High Street in 1988.

On Owen Street stands the former billiard hall (and dance hall) where Palitoy first started making soft-bodied dolls in 1937. Palitoy continued to make toys in the new factory which was built after WWII behind the Owen Street factory, with access from Jackson Street, until 1985. The old billiard hall was transformed into the Palitoy Design, Research and Development Department in the 70s.

The disused Municipal Cemetery off London Road contains some interesting monuments, such as those marking the graves of several victims of the Whitwick Colliery Disaster of 1898, and also the grave of William Bees, a recipient of the Victoria Cross. The cemetery also contains three Commonwealth war graves from World War I.

The Belvoir Centre shopping precinct occupies a large part of the town centre, with two main entrances on High Street and Belvoir Road. Though now regarded as outdated, this development was the first modern shopping precinct of the post-war era in Leicestershire and its construction cost approximately £1,000,000 in 1963. The precinct was formally opened by TV star, Noele Gordon. It contains seventy one shopping units and was overhauled in about 1990, when slate roof canopies were added around the precinct interior.

The former Rex Cinema in Marlborough Square retains numerous original art deco fittings and features. This was a Dunelm Mill shop until its closure in June 2016. The cinema was built by Walter Moss and Son at a cost of approximately £25,000 and was capable of seating 1,250 people. The cinema was opened on 2 February 1938.

Another building of note is the former Regal Cinema, which also stands in Marlborough Square. The revised edition of Pevsner&#x27;s &#x27;Buildings of England&#x27; draws attention to the building&#x27;s faux Egyptian façade. The Regal was built on the site of the former Olympia picture house (which had been built in 1910) and opened on 2 November 1933, with a seating capacity of 1,200. The &#x27;Cinema Treasures&#x27; website notes: &quot;the Regal Cinema had a brick and artificial stone facade with a pylon on the right to accommodate the entrance. Fountain motifs here were repeated inside the two-level auditorium as ante-proscenium grilles above balconettes, lit by Holophane colour lighting. Foyer murals of Italian gardens were by scenic artist George Legge of Bryan’s Adamanta, Birmingham&quot;. In 1992, the building was acquired by Flutters Bingo.

The headstocks and nineteenth century pithead buildings of the former Snibston Mine form a prominent feature to the west of the town and in 2012, work commenced on a £1.4 million restoration scheme, the buildings having appeared on English Heritage&#x27;s annual &quot;at risk&quot; register due to the state of the pithead structures, which had reached an advanced state of decay. However, though still ‘at risk’ the site is now a scheduled ancient monument.
The colliery was sunk in 1831 and closed in December 1983 although it was still used as a drift for Whitwick colliery until 1986. The Pithead Baths on the north side of Ashby Road are by J W M Dudding and date from 1940. These have now been used to accommodate local business ventures.

The Springboard Centre on Mantle Lane occupies a large Victorian building that was formerly occupied by Stableford and Co. – a wagon works established in 1862, which had manufactured railway rolling stock for home, colonial and foreign railways, employing 900 to 1,200 men. In 1985, the derelict premises was acquired by the Leicestershire County Council, the local district council, British Coal and other backers and used as a venue for the establishment of small businesses. The centre originally contained twenty one units and has since grown to accommodate businesses occupying more than seventy units; since its opening, over four hundred and thirty businesses and organisations have been based within the centre and the annual average number of jobs based with or connected with the Springboard Centre is in excess of three hundred and sixty. The row of houses adjoining the Springboard Centre were built by W.D Stableford to house the families of men who came from the Black Country to work at his waggon works.

Stephenson College is a modern building beside Thornborough Road. In March 2006 the architects, Pick Everard, received the Leicestershire and Rutland Society of Architects&#x27; President&#x27;s Award for the &#x27;cutting edge&#x27; design work on the college, which was completed in 2005.

The Whitwick Business Park, which incorporates the Morrison&#x27;s Supermarket and the adjacent retail complex, occupies a redeveloped part of the town which, for more than one hundred and fifty years, had been occupied by Whitwick Colliery. Officially opened on 6 November 1990, the Morrisons store comprises some 70,000 square feet and is a prominent feature overlooking the Stephenson Way, with a clock tower containing four faces at its south-west corner. Morrisons recently launched its own national clothing brand, &#x27;Nutmeg&#x27;, choosing to locate its headquarters close to the Coalville store.

The former St James&#x27; Church on Highfield Street, an Anglican church built in 1915 to serve the parish of Snibston, is a brick-built structure, by Stockdale Harrison and Son. Pevsner refers to its &quot;interesting internal arrangements with the roof supports forming passage aisles&quot;. The interior woodwork is of Columbian pine and a sanctuary, vestry and sacristry were added in 1966. The church closed, and the building is converted to a multi-occupancy business centre.

<text>Mount Kyllini or Mount Cyllene (; , ), also known as Mount Ziria (, ), is a mountain on the Peloponnese in Greece famous for its association with the god Hermes. It rises to above sea level, making it the second highest point on the peninsula. It is located near the border between the historic regions of Arcadia and Achaea—in the northeast of Arcadia, and entirely within modern Corinthia. It is located west of Corinth, northwest of Stymfalia, north of Tripoli, and south of Derveni. Several modern places are also named &quot;Kyllini&quot;.

==Description==
Much of the mountain is barren and rocky, although the area below is largely forested. There is an observatory at , at 22.67 east longitude and 37.97 north latitude. From the top a large portion of northeastern Peloponnesus is visible, including the eastern part of Achaia and Chelmos, the Gulf of Corinth and most of Corinthia, the southern part of Corinthia and parts of northeastern Arcadia. The nearest mountain ranges are Oligyrtos to the south and Chelmos/Aroania to the west. Roads pass near the southern and western slopes, but there are not many on the mountain itself, as much of the mountain is part of a park. The municipal boundary of Stymfalia–Feneos–Evrostini and Xylokastro passes through the mountain.

== Mythology ==

Cyllene (or Kyllene) herself was a mountain nymph who had taken for her consort Pelasges in the most ancient times recounted by Greek mythographers.
There was a port in Elis in antiquity named Cyllene near the mouth of the Alfeios, where the traveler Pausanias noted the image of Hermes, &quot;most devoutly worshiped by the inhabitants, is merely the male member upright on the pedestal.&quot;

In Greek mythology, Hermes was born in a sacred cave on the mountain, and so &quot;Cyllenius&quot; is a frequent epithet of his. The Homeric Hymn &quot;Hymn to Pan&quot; recalled that &quot;Hermes ... came to Arkadia ... there where his sacred place is as god of Kyllene. For there, though a god, he used to tend curly-fleeced sheep.&quot; 
In ancient times there was a temple and statue dedicated to him on the mountain&#x27;s summit, which by the time of Pausanias had fallen into ruins: 
:The highest mountain in Arkadia is Kyllene, on the top of which is a dilapidated temple of Hermes Kyllenios (of Mt Kyllene). It is clear that Kyllenos, the son of Elatos, gave the mountain its name and the god his surname. In days of old, men made wooden images, so far as I have been able to discover, from the following trees ebony, cypress, cedar, oak, yew, lotus. But the image of Hermes Kyllenios is made of none of these, but of juniper wood. Its height, I conjecture, is about eight feet.
This temple was said to be of the oldest temples ever built: 
:Those who first built temples to the gods . . . Lycaon [the mythical first king of Arkadia], son of Pelasgus, built a temple [the first] to Mercurius [Hermes] of Cyllene in Arcadia.
The Pleiades were born on Mount Kyllini. Gaius Julius Hyginus records that it was on Cyllene that the seer Tiresias changed sex when he struck two copulating snakes.

<doc id="351842" wikidata="Q5404386" url="?curid=351842" title="Ethnological Society of London">
<text>The Ethnological Society of London (ESL) was a learned society founded in 1843 as an offshoot of the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society (APS). The meaning of ethnology as a discipline was not then fixed: approaches and attitudes to it changed over its lifetime, with the rise of a more scientific approach to human diversity. Over three decades the ESL had a chequered existence, with periods of low activity and a major schism contributing to a patchy continuity of its meetings and publications. It provided a forum for discussion of what would now be classed as pioneering scientific anthropology from the changing perspectives of the period, though also with wider geographical, archaeological and linguistic interests.

In 1871 the ESL became part of what now is the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, merging back with the breakaway rival group the Anthropological Society of London.

==Background==
At the time of the Society&#x27;s foundation, &quot;ethnology&quot; was a neologism. The Société Ethnologique de Paris was founded in 1839, and the Ethnological Society of New York was founded in 1842. An earlier Anthropological Society of London existed from 1837 to 1842; Luke Burke who was a member published an &quot;Ethnological Journal&quot; in 1848.

The Paris society was set up by William Frederic Edwards, with a definite research programme in mind. Edwards had been lecturing for a decade on the deficiency of considering the races as purely linguistic groups. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records the term &quot;ethnology&quot; used in English by James Cowles Prichard in 1842, in his &quot;Natural History of Man&quot;, for the &quot;history of nations&quot;. The approach to ethnology current at the time of the Society&#x27;s founding relied on climate and social factors to explain human diversity; the debate was still framed by Noah&#x27;s Flood, and the corresponding monogenism of human origins. Prichard was a major figure in looking at human variability from a diachronic angle, and argued for ethnology as such a study, aimed at resolving the question of human origins.

The early days of ethnology saw it in the position of a fringe science. Prichard commented in 1848 that the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) still classed ethnology as a subdivision of natural history, as applied to man. It stayed in Section D for a period, but in 1851 it was classed in a new Section E for Geology and Geography, after lobbying by supporters including Roderick Murchison. The overlap of interests between the ESL and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) was reflected by common membership.

Around 1860 the discovery of human antiquity and the publication of the &quot;Origin of Species&quot; caused a fundamental change of perspective, with the older historical approach looking hopeless given the emergence of prehistory, but the biological issue gaining in interest.

==Tensions in the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society==

The Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society (APS) was set up as a result of parliamentary committee activity, and was largely the initiative of Thomas Fowell Buxton. It produced reports, but in the wake of the Niger expedition of 1841 some of its supporters believed a case made on science was being sidelined in the activities of the APS. The APS was founded by Quakers in order to promote a specific social and political agenda. The Ethnological Society, though primarily a scientific organization, retained some of its predecessor&#x27;s liberal outlook and activist bent.

==Foundation==
An ethnological questionnaire was produced by the BAAS in 1841, arising from a committee led by Thomas Hodgkin of the APS, and drawing on prior work in Paris by W. F. Edwards. A prospectus for the Ethnological Society was issued in July 1842 by Richard King; King had been a student under Hodgkin at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. The Society first met in February 1843 at Hodgkin&#x27;s house; or on 31 January, when Ernst Dieffenbach read a paper &quot;On the Study of Ethnology&quot;.

Among the other founders were James Cowles Prichard, John Beddoe and John Brown. Apart from Hodgkin, King and Dieffenbach, the other significant common member with the APS was William Aldam, another Quaker. The Society had Corresponding Members, who counted as Fellows; they later included Hermann Welcker. In the early days the Society had rooms at 27 Sackville Street, which were rented through King to the Westminster Medical Society.

==1840s==
John Briggs became a Fellow of the ESL in 1845, and Brian Houghton Hodgson, also representing the ethnology of India, was at some point made an Honorary Fellow. William Augustus Miles was a member and published a paper on the aboriginal Australian culture.

After Prichard&#x27;s death in 1848, the intellectual leader in the Society became Robert Gordon Latham. Links to the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society were retained through the common membership of Hodgkin and Henry Christy, though the break was not completely amicable. The Ethnological Society in its early years lacked good contacts with officialdom, certainly compared to the RGS and its good working relationship with the Colonial Office. Governor George Grey was helpful to the Society, but he was an exception: it took until the end of the decade for the Society to begin to appreciate its marginal position with respect to the flow of information from the British colonies. Grey was an active member of the ESL while abroad as a colonial administrator, and his network included William Ellis, another member.

==1850s==
In 1850 the Society was based at 17 Savile Row. It saw a period of decline in the middle of the decade. Among active members on the Council was William Devonshire Saull, who died in 1855. George Bellas Greenough was a vice-president. Richard Cull&#x27;s 1852 report mentioned Singapore connections, in particular James Richardson Logan.

Thomas Richard Heywood Thomson delivered a paper in 1854 to the Society on interfertility, casting doubt on comments of Paweł Edmund Strzelecki about female infertility among Aboriginal Australians after they had given birth to a child with a white father. The communication was well received, but as a contribution to the ongoing debate on race, was far from settling the significant underlying issue.

James Hunt joined the ESL in 1854, and became a divisive figure because of his attacks on humanitarian attitudes of missionaries and abolitionists. He served as secretary from 1859 to 1862. He found an ally in John Crawfurd, who had retired from service as colonial diplomat and administrator for the East India Company. Crawfurd came to ethnology through its section in the BAAS. His published views on race were discordant with the Quaker and APS tradition in the ESL. Hunt and Crawfurd in 1858 tried to dislodge the President Sir James Clark at an ESL meeting, unsuccessfully, while Hodgkin was out of the country.

==1860s==
The 1860s saw a revived interest in ethnology, triggered by recent work, such as that involving flint implements and the antiquity of man. The Ethnological Society became a more of meeting-place for archaeologists, as its interests kept pace with new work; and during this decade the Society became a very different institution. The society&#x27;s original members had mainly been military officers, civil servants, and members of the clergy, but by the early 1860s younger scientists had supplanted them. The background was of continuing encounters worldwide with many peoples; John Thomson the photographer who was recording them became a member in 1866. Thomas Henry Huxley, Augustus Lane Fox, Edward Tylor, Henry Christy, John Lubbock, and Augustus Wollaston Franks all figured prominently in the society&#x27;s affairs after 1860.

The ESL&#x27;s meetings and journal served as a forum for sharing new ideas, and as a clearing-house for ethnological data. In 1868 the Society set up a Classification Committee to try to get on top of the issues caused by haphazard reporting, and lack of systematic fieldwork. This initiative was a proposal of Lane Fox.

==Split and merger==
In the years after the publication of the &quot;Origin of Species&quot; in 1859, the &quot;Ethnologicals&quot; generally supported Charles Darwin against his critics, and rejected the more extreme forms of scientific racism. The movement towards Darwinism was not one way, however, as evidenced by the Honorary Fellowship given to Robert Knox in 1860.

The Anthropological Society of London (ASL) was founded in 1863 as an institutional home for those who disagreed with the Ethnological Society&#x27;s politics (in terms of party loyalties, Stocking makes the political complexion of the ESL 75% Liberal to 25% Conservative, with the proportions reversed in the ASL). On the topic of race, the Ethnological Society retained views descending from Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, who had a five-race theory but was a monogenist, and from Prichard. The post-Darwin concept of human speciation was unacceptable to those forming the Anthropological Society.

The two societies co-existed warily for several years. The X Club, with members in common, supported the Ethnological Society&#x27;s side of the debate. Both societies took an interest in sexual morality as a topic, but the attitude of social evolutionism was very largely restricted to the Ethnological Society, where John Ferguson McLennan was a member, with the exception of Charles Staniland Wake who made little impact at the time. Huxley made efforts to merge the societies in 1866, but was blocked by Crawfurd; the attempt was renewed in 1868 after Crawfurd&#x27;s death. The Ethnological Society and Anthropological Society merged in 1871 into the Anthropological Institute. A small group of past supporters of Hunt broke away in 1873, forming a London Anthropological Society that lasted two years.

==Publications==
Initially the Ethnological Society did not aim to publish its own learned journal. Instead it adopted a suggestion of Robert Jameson, who edited the &quot;Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal&quot;, to have its transactions published there. The early flow of published papers was in fact sparse. Volume 46 from 1848 contained papers by George Ruxton and James Henry Skene contributed via the Ethnological Society.

The &quot;Journal of the Ethnological Society of London&quot; was published in the years 1848 to 1856, a period in which four volumes appeared, and the Society&#x27;s scientific activities were less marginal. It was edited by Thomas Wright. It then was published once more, under the title &quot;Transactions of the Ethnological Society of London&quot;, from 1861 to 1869; it was renamed and published, from 1869 to 1870, again as &quot;Journal of the Ethnological Society of London&quot;, and was edited by George Busk.

<text>Alex Grey (born November 29, 1953) is an American visual artist, author, teacher, and Vajrayana practitioner known for creating spiritual and psychedelic artwork such as his 21-painting &quot;Sacred Mirrors&quot; series. He works in multiple forms including performance art, process art, installation art, sculpture, visionary art, and painting. He is also on the board of advisors for the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics, and is the Chair of Wisdom University&#x27;s Sacred Art Department. He and his wife Allyson Grey are the co-founders of The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors (CoSM), a non-profit organization in Wappingers Falls, New York.

==Early life and education==
Grey was born Alexander Velzy on November 29, 1953, in Columbus, Ohio. His father was a graphic designer and artist. Grey was the middle child. He attended the Columbus College of Art and Design for two years before dropping out. Grey went on to study art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts in Boston in 1975. At the end of art school, Grey met his wife Allyson at a party where they both ingested LSD and later bonded over the experience. He reported that the LSD was initially given to him by his professor.

==Career==
Grey learned anatomy by working to prepare cadavers for dissection at Harvard Medical School&#x27;s anatomy department, a position he held for five years. He worked as a medical illustrator for approximately ten years in order to support his studio art practice. Grey also taught anatomy and figure sculpture at New York University for a period of ten years.

Grey is best known for his psychedelic paintings and illustrations. In 1986 Grey&#x27;s artwork was exhibited at the New Museum in New York City.

Alex and Allyson Grey have worked collaboratively and have openly supported the use of entheogens. 

&quot;Mending the Heart Net,&quot; an interactive installation artwork by Alex and Allyson Grey, was displayed at Baltimore&#x27;s American Visionary Art Museum in 1998–99 as part of the exhibition &quot;Love: Error and Eros&quot;.

In 1999, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego held a mid-career retrospective of Grey&#x27;s work titled &quot;Sacred Mirrors: The Visionary Art of Alex Grey&quot;. That same year, Grey was noticed by guitarist Adam Jones of the progressive metal band Tool, who later featured his artwork on their albums &quot;Lateralus&quot; and &quot;10,000 Days.&quot;

Illustrations created by Grey have been selected to appear on albums for musical groups such as the Beastie Boys and Nirvana, as well as Meshuggah and The String Cheese Incident. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, and the Discovery Channel, have featured his artwork. His images have been printed onto sheets of blotter acid and have been used on flyers to promote Rave events.

Grey&#x27;s artwork has been exhibited worldwide, including at Feature Inc., Tibet House US, Stux Gallery, P.S. 1, the Outsider Art Fair, the Grand Palais in Paris, and the Sao Paulo Biennial in Brazil.

Grey has been a keynote speaker at conferences in Tokyo, Amsterdam, Basel, Barcelona and Manaus. In the 2012 book &quot;Psychedelia&quot;, author Patrick Lundborg credits Grey as &quot;the leading psychedelic artist of today, and also one of the foremost proponents of Visionary Art as a style.&quot;

Since 2020, Alex Grey and Allyson Grey have created a podcast that features a variety of topics. Episodes include musings about religion, science, visionary art, nature, meditations, and full moon ceremonies.  Mr. and Mrs. Grey have interviewed artists, philosophers, YouTubers, musicians, and PhD candidates. 

=== The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors ===
Grey founded the Foundation for Sacred Mirrors (CoSM), a 501(c)3 as a place to permanently display the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors. Additionally, he created the Church of Sacred Mirrors (CoSM).

CoSM allows visitors a place of respite and worship while admiring Grey’s artwork and writings. Other invited artists can display their works at the CoSM. According to CoSM’s website, “The mission of CoSM is to build an enduring sanctuary of visionary art to inspire a global community.”

Located in Wappinger, New York, visitors can stroll the 40 acres while enjoying art by Alex Grey, Allyson Grey, and Amy Senn, to name a few. Alex Grey, Allyson Grey, and various other artists created murals that can be found in the cafeteria at CoSM.  The property contains a 10 bedroom Victorian guest home that is decorated with art in the visionary style of Grey. A large amount of Grey’s work is displayed in Entheon, a converted carriage house on the property.  The Greys are currently raising funds for the completion of Entheon. Visitors will enter through bronze doors (see below) that display “Creating a Better World” by Alex Grey.

While in Entheon, visitors can also admire Grey’s works &quot;Kissing&quot;, &quot;Copulating&quot;, &quot;Pregnancy&quot;, &quot;Birth&quot;, &quot;Gaia&quot;, &quot;Net of Being&quot; (featured by the band Tool), and &quot;Nursing&quot;.” Viewers will also be able to enter the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors.

Grey&#x27;s project The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors (CoSM) first opened to the public in Chelsea, New York in 2004 and drew visionary and psychedelic art fans to the site for four years until its closure in December 2008. The CoSM featured 20 life-size paintings of standing human figures Grey created in the early 1980s.

The Greys reopened CoSM in Wappingers Falls, New York, a community within Hudson Valley.

=== Painting ===

Grey&#x27;s paintings are a blend of sacred art, visionary art, postmodern art and psychedelic art. He is best known for his paintings of glowing anatomical human bodies, images that &quot;x-ray&quot; the multiple layers of reality. His art is a complex integration of body, mind, and spirit. The &quot;Sacred Mirrors&quot;, a life-sized series of 21 paintings, took 10 years to complete, and examines in detail the physical and metaphysical anatomy of the individual. &quot;The inner body is meticulously rendered - not just anatomically precise but crystalline in its clarity&quot;. Many of his paintings include detailed representations of the skeleton, nervous system, cardiovascular system, and lymphatic system. Grey applies this multidimensional perspective to paint the universal human experience. His figures are shown in positions such as praying, meditating, kissing, copulating, pregnancy, birth, and death.

Grey&#x27;s work incorporates many religious symbols, including auras, chakras, and icons with geometric shapes and tessellations in natural, industrial, and multicultural situations. Grey&#x27;s paintings are permeated with an intense and subtle light.

&quot;It is the light that is sublime in Grey’s oeuvre - which is the most important innovation in religious light since the Baroque - and that makes the mundane beings in them seem sublime, in every realistic detail of their exquisite being&quot;.

His highly detailed paintings are spiritual and scientific in equal measure, revealing his psychedelic, spiritual and super-natural view of the human species.

In 2002, Holland Cotter, &quot;New York Times&quot; art critic wrote, &quot;Alex Grey&#x27;s art, with its New Age symbolism and medical-illustration finesse, might be described as psychedelic realism, a kind of clinical approach to cosmic consciousness. In it, the human figure is rendered transparently with X-ray or CAT-scan eyes, the way Aldous Huxley saw a leaf when he was on mescaline. Every bone, organ and vein is detailed in refulgent color; objects and space are knitted together in dense, decorative linear webs.&quot;

===Writing===
In 1990 Grey published a large format art book, &quot;Sacred Mirrors: The Visionary Art of Alex Grey&quot;. The book included essays on the significance of Grey&#x27;s work by Ken Wilber, and by New York art critic, Carlo McCormick.

Grey&#x27;s &quot;The Mission of Art&quot;, a philosophy of art, originally published in 1998 with a foreword by Ken Wilber was reissued in 2017. The book traces the evolution of human consciousness through art history, explores the role of an artist&#x27;s intention and conscience, and reflects on the creative process as a spiritual path. He promotes the mystical potential of art and argues that the process of artistic creation has an important role to play in the enlightenment of both the artist and the broader culture.

In &quot;Transfigurations,&quot; published in 2001, Grey addresses his portrayals of light bodies, performance works, his collaborative relationship with Allyson Grey, and their quest to build a Chapel of Sacred Mirrors.

Sounds True has released &quot;The Visionary Artist&quot;, a CD of Grey&#x27;s reflections on art as a spiritual practice.

Grey co-edited the book, &quot;Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics&quot; (Chronicle Books, 2002, reprinted by Synergetic Press, 2015).

Alex Grey has published a 10 volume journal that features his own artistic works and the works of other visionary thinkers and philosophers.

===Film===
As an advocate for sacred art, Grey was the subject of the 2004 documentary &quot;ARTmind: the healing potential of sacred art.&quot;

Grey and the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors gallery in New York City were featured in the 2006 documentary &quot;CoSM The Movie&quot;, directed by Nick Krasnic.

Grey appeared in the 2006 film &quot;Entheogen: Awakening the Divine Within&quot;, a documentary about rediscovering an enchanted cosmos in the modern world.

He also appeared in the film &quot;, &quot;in which he talked about the importance of the substance DMT in the past and present world, as well as describing some of his personal experiences with the substance and how it influenced his painting.

Grey appeared in the 2016 documentary film &quot;Going Furthur&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 2008, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that Grey lived in New York City with his wife, painter Allyson Grey. They have one daughter, Zena Grey. Grey is a member of the Integral Institute, formed by his friend Ken Wilber.

==In the media==
The &quot;Viking Youth Power Hour&quot; interviewed Alex and Allyson Grey about the role of sacred art, the holy shenanigans of Burning Man, and the development of his process.

In &quot;Variable Star&quot;, a 2006 science fiction novel written by Spider Robinson based on a story outline by Robert A. Heinlein, Robinson devotes several pages to his protagonist&#x27;s discovery of Grey&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Mirrors&quot; and &quot;Progress of the Soul&quot; series, and to using them to enhance meditation.

In 2013 Grey appeared on the podcast of Joe Rogan.

It gives its name to the wider Bromsgrove District, of which it is the largest town and administrative centre. In the Middle Ages, it was a small market town, primarily producing cloth through the early modern period. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it became a major centre for nail making.

== History ==
===Anglo-Saxon===
Bromsgrove is first documented in the early ninth century as Bremesgraf. An &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; entry for 909 AD mentions a &quot;Bremesburh&quot;; possibly also referring to Bromsgrove. The Domesday Book of 1086 references &quot;Bremesgrave&quot;. The name means &quot;Bremi&#x27;s grove&quot;. The grove element may refer to the supply of wood to Droitwich for the salt pans.

During the Anglo-Saxon period the Bromsgrove area had a woodland economy; including hunting, maintenance of haies and pig farming.
At the time of Edward the Confessor, the manor of Bromsgrove is known to have been held by Earl Edwin, who became Earl of Mercia in 1062.

===Norman and medieval===
After the Norman conquest, the manor that later held the town of Bromsgrove was held by the King. The royal manor of Bromsgrove and King&#x27;s Norton covered from Woodcote to Deritend. Among the manor&#x27;s possessions were thirteen salt pans at Droitwich, with three workers, producing 300 mits. The king had the right to sell the salt from his pans before any other salt in the town.
Bromsgrove is sited at the centre of a very large parish, with its church, St John the Baptist, standing at a prominent point in the local landscape. Bromsgrove, along with all the towns in north Worcestershire, was committed to defending the city of Worcester, and is recorded to have contributed burgesses to Droitwich in 1086. There may also have been Anglo-Saxon or Norman fortifications in Bromsgrove, but no archaeological evidence remains outside the literature.

Bromsgrove and the surrounding area was put under forest law when the boundaries of Feckenham Forest were extended hugely by Henry II. Forest law was removed from the Bromsgrove area in 1301 in the reign of Edward I, when the boundaries were moved back.

Bromsgrove was one of the smallest urban settlements in the county, and had no formal status as a borough. A market day was first granted in 1200; however, even at this time, there is little record of an urban settlement. Later, in the 1230s, Henry III arranged that the rectory manor of St. John was transferred to Worcester Priory, to support the remembrance of his father King John, who was buried there. This meant that the town which grew up around this period was divided between two jurisdictions and landlords, the royal manor in the east, and the rectory manor controlled by Worcester Priory in the west. The division ran along the High Street. Nevertheless, records show no sign of an urban settlement in 1240–1250. New initiatives to establish a market took place in 1250, and Bromsgrove residents appear in the tax records by 1275.

The town appears to have been founded as a series of plots of sizes between , marked out along the current High Street. These plots can still be discerned today, in the sizes of the frontages of the buildings. The road entering Bromsgrove from the west appears to have been diverted to ensure that it met Bromsgrove at the furthest point north, forcing travellers to pass south through the whole High Street if intending to continue west.
The town probably benefited from the growth of the local agricultural population in the early medieval period, which began to establish new farmland in places like Stoke Prior and Hanbury through assarting (creating clearings in) Feckenham Forest. Similarly, the number of minor aristocratic, gentry and ecclesiastical estates grew, which would have needed to buy and sell goods. Hanbury alone had six manor houses and two granges in the 1200s. The Priory Manor itself would have been a potential customer, as would Grafton Manor just south of the town. Nevertheless, not all the local trade would have passed directly through Bromsgrove, as the Priory for instance would often take locally produced goods directly to Droitwich or Worcester, or purchase them directly at other larger centres with particular specialisms.

In 1317, it was given the right hold a Tuesday market and three-day fair every 29 August at the Decollation of St. John the Baptist. The market place and tollhouse were located at the junction of St. John Street and the High Street. Its market was especially used by the surrounding area to sell surplus oats, which were increasingly produced in the area, while wheat was grown in southern Worcestershire. The area was known for the high quality of its pigs.

Common trades can be traced from surnames in this period, and included in the years to 1327 bakers, tanners, carpenters, drapers, dyers, butchers, masons, smiths, shoemakers and fullers. The town had a large number of tanneries and cloth was also produced. Tanneries and breweries were located on the Priory manor side of the town, with access to the Spadesbourne brook. This created significant problems of pollution.

Bromsgrove benefited from sales to travellers, for instance of beer, bread, horsebread, meat and cheese. Brewing and selling ale seems to have been predominantly done by women in Bromsgrove, perhaps to supplement the main income of the household. Between 22 and 29 people are recorded in the 1300s at the Court Leet paying &#x27;fines&#x27; for selling ale for more than the fixed price; this seems to have been applied in effect as a tax. Women were able to hold property, sometimes as widows or jointly with their husbands, and owned up to 10% of Bromsgrove&#x27;s plots at various times.

After the Black Death, the social structure of the Bromsgrove&#x27;s hinterland changed. Farms tended to merge and become larger, and moved from producing crops to raising livestock. This resulted in higher value goods like wool, leather and meat being sold through Bromsgrove&#x27;s market and contributed to the town&#x27;s prosperity in the later Middle Ages. The town&#x27;s population would have fell, but can still be estimated as around 400 in the later 1300s. The aftermath of the Black Death also caused traders to attempt to hike their prices, which the courts attempted to suppress.

Even in later years, Bromsgrove did not grow a market in luxury goods, except for one haberdasher. Its markets did not compete with the larger centres for the highest value goods, such as wines or jewellery.

Church court records show that Bromsgrove had an urban underclass, including prostitutes and beggars. Assaults, murders and burglaries are also recorded. Servants, often young people, feature particularly in the records of disorderly behaviour. However, violence was not confined to the lower and middle orders; other courts issued warrants for the arrest of two of the Staffords of Grafton Manor in the 1401 and 1450, along with their followers, some natives of Bromsgrove, for politically motivated violence.
Governance of the town itself is difficult to discern. Manorial records give evidence for courts, rents and fines, but do not present evidence about the organisation of matters that relate to the town itself, such as the maintenance of roads and other facilities. The main representative post appears to be that of Bailiff. The royal manor, with its Court Leet, dealt with the majority of financial matters including tolls and revenues from the market, after disputes with the Priory manor over rights to various revenues and fines were settled. The royal manor would therefore have paid for the upkeep of the market and the tollhouse, which also served at some points as a jail.

Christopher Dyer suggests that local societies may have grown up to deal with some of its organisational issues. There was for instance a guild in the town during the 1300s. There were three crosses erected in the town, and reports of well-paved roads in the 1400s, so Dyer concludes that the town&#x27;s voluntary self-organisation seems to have been adequate to deal with its key problems.

Bromsgrove in the Middle Ages probably reached a population of no more than 600. It was not especially wealthy. Taxation records show that most families, even among the richest, had relatively moderate incomes, compared to other towns in the Midlands. It did, however, have an urban character, and attracted people into the town from the surrounding area.

===Early modern===
By the end of the Middle Ages, Bromsgrove was a centre for the wool trade. Manufacture of cloth, particularly narrow cloth and friezes is first recorded in 1533. Nailmaking was probably introduced in the region in the sixteenth century and was taking place in Bromsgrove in the seventeenth century. It provided an alternative trade for the rural poor, who would initially have supplemented other work with the nail trade.

At the Reformation, around 1540, the Priory Manor was given to the new Dean and Chapter. Tithe collection and rents would have carried on in a similar fashion.

One major change was the political fortunes of the Talbot family, who chose to remain Catholics. They were connected to the Wintours by marriage, with the result that they were suspected of involvement in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605.

====Civil War, Restoration and dissenting religion====

Bromsgrove did not play a major military role in the English Civil War, although it was a town involved in the support of the Trained Bands, the system of local militias used for law enforcement. In 1642, as preparations for war were made, Parliament surveyed the capabilities of the trained bands and documented that Bromsgrove had a store of munitions, including ten barrels of powder. The Royalists occupied the county in late 1642, following the Battle of Edgehill. In February 1643, Charles I ordered that Bromsgrove&#x27;s vicar John Hall be removed from his post as a rebel.

The town would have been subject to the deprivations of the county in the wars, such as high taxation, pressing of men into military service and requisitioning of food and other property as armies passed through the area. For instance, in 1643, the Worcestershire Committee complained to the King about the &quot;plunderings and abuses&quot; of the Royalist troops of Sir Thomas Aston, which had made it impossible for Bromsgrove and other places to pay their monthly contributions. The following year, Parliamentary forces briefly imposed themselves on northern Worcestershire. In June 1644, General William Waller&#x27;s force of around 10,000 men pursued the King&#x27;s army across the county as it retreated from Oxford. Waller&#x27;s army during June lived off whatever they could requisition, first in the Vale of Evesham, then Bromsgrove and Kidderminster.

The Talbot family who held Grafton became central figures in the county&#x27;s military organisation under the Royalists. The promotion of Catholics and recusants like the Talbots was a source of controversy in Worcestershire, referred to, for instance, by the clubmen in their attempts to resist the demands of both armies in the later part of the first war. In the third civil war of 1649, the Talbots joined King Charles II at the Battle of Worcester with a force of local men and had a role in his escape. The battle was traumatic for the county, as the Scottish troops in support of Charles looted as they traversed the county.

Afterwards, as some of the Scots dispersed trying to escape, further skirmishes occurred as they were arrested or killed. Local tradition recounts that Battlefield Brook and Battlefields Farm was named after one of the encounters, although it is unclear whether before or after.

Disputes about the vicarage continued through the Interregnum and Protectorate. John Hall was vicar again until 1652. John Hall&#x27;s successor John Spilsbury, previously a fellow of Magdalen College, was unpopular with some of Bromsgrove&#x27;s churchgoers, who attempted unsuccessfully to eject him. Spilsbury was removed after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, and left the Church of England by refusing to conform to the Act of Uniformity along with around 2,000 other Anglican ministers from the Commonwealth period. He was confined to his house, banished from the county and finally imprisoned for his non-conformism. The toll on his health may have led to illness and death. He did return to Bromsgrove, where he was annually visited by Hall&#x27;s son, an Anglican bishop. He was licensed as a Congregationalist teacher in 1672 in Bromsgrove and died in 1699. A Congregationalist chapel was established in Bromsgrove in 1693.

====18th century====
 Cloth manufacture fell into decline in the 1700s. By 1778, 140 hands (i.e., people) were employed in the manufacture of linsey and linen employed 180. By comparison, nail making employed 900 hands by this time and had become a thriving industry.

Market day changed several times over the period, settling on Tuesday from 1792 onwards. Fairs were held twice yearly, in June and October by the eighteenth century, with the modern pleasure fairs originating from the June horse and pleasure fair.

===Industrial revolution and Victorian===
Dugdale described the town in 1819 as &quot;a large and dirty place, full of shops and manufacturers of needles, nails, sheeting and other coarse linen.&quot; By 1897, Robert Sherard depicts a town that appears rather bucolic and &quot;bright and sweet and clean.&quot; However, approaching the nailmaker&#x27;s cottages, one could &quot;pass in one minute from prosperous burgherdom to the lowest slavery&quot;.

====Water-powered manufacturing====

Bromsgrove and the outlying area along the Spadesbourne and Battlefield Brook had a series of around 14 watermills that supported small and medium-sized manufacturing. Some of these were corn mills, others processed linen and lint. These continued to provide employment through most of the nineteenth century, but declined towards the end.

Within the town, Cotton Mill was used for cotton and worsted until around 1830, reopening briefly in the 1850s. The 6-to-7-acre pool located in what is now Sanders Park was drained in 1865. It was a five-storey building, demolished in 1892. Near Charford, Moat Mill served as a flour mill with five grindstones until around 1913, and the Lint Mill, at what is now South Bromsgrove High School, was a corn and worsted mill. The Lint Mill closed after the Second World War.

The oldest mill, the King&#x27;s Mill or Town Mill, had been part of the rectory manor. It was demolished around 1881.

====Nailmaking====

Bromsgrove and the Black Country were centres of nail production, made by hand, usually as a family enterprise. Nailmakers in Bromsgrove lived in slum conditions in small cottages in courtyards off the High Street, and in Sidemoor and Catshill. Their sheds were attached to the cottages. As a result, the pollution and dirt was hard to control.

Nailmakers would purchase their iron from the nailmasters and sell their nails to nailmasters at set prices, effectively at a piece-rate. The basic technique of nail production did not change much, involving in essence heating iron rods, making a point, half cutting the nail off, fully cutting it and hammering a head. Simple nails might take a few blows and take a matter of seconds to make, while complex nails could involve twelve to twenty blows. Both men and women made nails, men making the more complex nails requiring greater physical effort, and women producing the simpler, smaller nails.

Mechanisation quickly put the industry into decline from the 1840s. Nailmasters resorted to measures such as paying workers in tokens, redeemable only at their own stores, to maintain their profitability. 

The industry lasted longer in Bromsgrove, being the dominant occupation in the town through most of the 1800s due to lack of alternative work. As mechanisation took over, nailmakers produced nails that were still hard to produce by machine. Despite this, there was a great deal of pressure on wages, which became low, causing an industry-wide strike in 1842, when nailmasters attempted to reduce their purchase prices by 10%. Fifteen thousand nailers attended a meeting in Dudley Market Place, including around 1,500 from Bromsgrove. The nailers brought caltrops, known to them as the &#x27;tis-was&#x27;, to prevent the 6th Hussars from charging and breaking up their protest. The Hussars were prevented from breaking up the assembly. However, after ten weeks of strike, the nailers returned to work without any concessions.

Six more major strikes followed in the years to 1891. The longest three included a twenty-week strike in 1860, and a twelve-week strike in 1868. In 1869, a ten-week strike was caused after nail prices were cut by 20% in the &#x27;Starvation list&#x27;. A meeting of 4,500 people at Crown Close led to the formation of a Nailers&#x27; Union. Nailers also vowed not to teach their children the trade, a promise swiftly broken due to the lack of alternative employment. Further strikes took place in 1877 and 1878 due to a further 10% cut. When Bromsgrove&#x27;s nailers were offered the old prices, they returned to work, despite the fact that the Black Country nailers had not received the same offer, which caused much resentment. The Bromsgrove nailers continued to pay into the strike fund, however.

The poor working conditions prompted a Parliamentary investigation and report in 1888. Shortly after, a final 16-week strike in 1891–92 was supported by the &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot; who paid £100 into the strike fund, and the chainmakers of Brierley Hill contributed a further £25. Events were organised and a soup kitchen provided, alongside strike pay. The nailmasters offered increased prices of 20% and eventually agreed 30–40%; however, the increased rates may have hastened the demise of the industry.
The industry featured in Robert Sherard&#x27;s book &quot;The White Slaves of England&quot; in 1897, which includes a detailed picture of nailmaking in its final years. At this time, working weeks of 70–90 hours were commonplace and poverty still widespread. Their diet was typically bread, margarine and tea, with cheese as an occasional supplement, and sometimes meat. Chickens and pigs were often kept as another way to supplement their diet.

Nailmakers would often make supplementary income in the summer picking fruit at Dodford, at the former Chartist plots.

&quot;Foggers&quot;, or middle men who typically owned general stores, would buy nails at a 30% discount from nailers, and often pay in tokens to redeem in their shops, despite the Truck Act, which had banned such practices. They were able to do this largely because they offered credit to the impoverished nailmakers. Nailmakers, even when supplying directly to nailmasters, were subject to arbitrary decisions. A particular grievance was that they would sometimes reject a week&#x27;s work essentially due to oversupply, perhaps claiming the quality was low, leaving the nailmaker with no income and the need to purchase new iron.

Some found comfort in religion; Sherard quotes one as saying: &quot;when I get to heaven I shall get my reward, and my Oppressor will get his&quot;. Hymn singing while working was common, and the &quot;Doxology&quot; was a particular favourite.

The industry finally declined in the early twentieth century, as jobs in the car industry at Longbridge and elsewhere became available. Most of the nailmaker&#x27;s cottages were demolished in slum clearances in the twentieth century.

====Canals and railways====

The canals did not quite reach Bromsgrove&#x27;s town, although several plans were made. The nearest points on the network were Tardebigge and Stoke Works on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, built between 1792 and 1815. Canals did connect Birmingham, Droitwich and Worcester. Plans to add a link to Bromsgrove were dropped once the railways started to meet local transport needs instead.

The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway built the Lickey Incline, which opened in 1840. It was an engineering compromise, designed under protest by the company&#x27;s engineer Captain Moorsom, to reduce the costs of construction by heading straight upwards, rather than meandering to take the gradient slowly. The design was mocked by leading engineers such as Stephenson and Brunel. The 1 in 37½ gradient imposed long-term costs on the operation of the railway, particularly the need for extra engines to push freight and passengers up the hill.
 Two railwaymen, Tom Scaife and Joseph Rutherford, were killed by an explosion that took place on 10 November 1840 while they were inspecting a steam locomotive named &quot;Surprise&quot;. It was being considered for sale to the new railway. One died instantly, the other a day later.

Another accident occurred at the nascent works in March 1841, when a botched repair caused steam to escape from one of the locomotives onto the drunken William Creuze, causing his death. The result was that the works were reorganised under a new manager GD Bischopp and a foreman recruited from Manchester, James McConnell. Working practices were very unsafe, as well as difficult and expensive, as a result of the incline and the previous mismanagement. McConnell took charge of reorganising the use of the line&#x27;s engines. He introduced a number of innovations, in the face of a board that was intent on severe cost cutting, by presenting many of the needs he had as means to save money, which often they were. He also persuaded them to allow him to build a house to his own design, which stood by the old Bromsgrove station.
McConnell rebuilt some of the engines as saddle tanks as a cost-saving measure to remove the need for the bankers to haul engine tenders with them up the incline. In 1845, he built a new banker &quot;Great Britain&quot;, which became very well known among engineers, some of whom visited to view it in summer 1846. Probably after this, McConnell persuaded Stephenson and others to set up the Institute of Mechanical Engineers at his home in Bromsgrove.

McConnell left at the end of 1846. Bromsgrove railway works was then leased for a period, but later became a maintenance facility and wagon works for the Midland Railway. The works provided employment for many people in Bromsgrove.

====Other industrial history====
The Bromsgrove Union Workhouse, on the Birmingham Road, was opened in 1838 and closed in 1948 and is in use as an office building today.

====Church and Chapel building====
The expansion of Bromsgrove&#x27;s population resulted in church building and restoration projects. Major restoration of the mostly 13th-to-14th-century St. John the Baptist church was carried out in 1858 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Worcester Road was built by Gilbert Blount in 1858. All Saints Church was constructed by John Cotton in 1872–74.

The Congregationalist chapel at Chapel Street from 1693 was rebuilt in 1832. A Baptist Chapel was built on New Road in 1866–67.

===Evolution of location government, 19th and 20th centuries===

Bromsgrove was an ancient parish, which covered a large rural area as well as the town itself. In 1846 a body of improvement commissioners was established to provide infrastructure and other local government functions for the built-up area of the town. The commissioners&#x27; district was reconstituted as a local government district in 1859, with the commissioners being replaced by an elected local board. A separate local government district covering the rest of the parish was created in 1863, known as &quot;Bromsgrove Country&quot;.

Such districts were converted into urban districts in 1894. The Bromsgrove Country Urban District was renamed North Bromsgrove Urban District in 1896. It was subsequently abolished in 1933, being split between the Bromsgrove Urban District and several neighbouring parishes. Bromsgrove Urban District Council initially met at the Town Hall, which stood at the corner of High Street and St John&#x27;s Street. The council moved to the former vicarage of St John&#x27;s Church on St John&#x27;s Street in the 1920s, after which the Town Hall was demolished. Bromsgrove Urban District was abolished in 1974, merging with the surrounding Bromsgrove Rural District to become the modern Bromsgrove District.

===20th century===

Bromsgrove was home from 1898 to 1966 to the Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts, a company of craftsmen who produced many fine works of sculpture, ironwork, etc., including the gates of Buckingham Palace (the locks of which are stamped with the Guild&#x27;s name), the lifts on the &quot;Lusitania&quot;, the Liver Birds on the Royal Liver Building and the famous statue adorning the Fortune Theatre in Drury Lane.

Nearly all nail making had ceased by the 1920s, with the very last workers dying in the 1950s. The last of the water mills, the Lint Mill, closed by the 1950s. The wagon works closed in 1964, as a result of the Beeching rail reorganisation, the government&#x27;s response to the shift to road transport. The site was demolished and cleared in the 1980s.

During the twentieth century, many people in Bromsgrove were employed in Birmingham, for instance at Longbridge&#x27;s car factory. Other allied employment came from Garringtons, a drop forge plant in Aston Fields, from the 1940s. Garringtons closed in 2002.

Motorways came to Bromsgrove with the construction of the M5 motorway to Lydiate Ash in 1962, and northwards from 1967 to 1970. The M42 motorway joining the A38 at the north end of Bromsgrove was opened in 1987 and in December 1989 the link to the M5 was opened. A relief road on the west of the town was built to direct traffic away from the High Street, and a bypass was constructed on the eastern side of the town allowing traffic to avoid the town centre entirely.

The town&#x27;s population expanded rapidly from the 1980s to present, with new housing estates added to the south of the town, and infilling industrial areas such as the former railway works and Garringtons in Aston Fields.

== Governance and politics ==

There are two tiers of local government covering Bromsgrove, at district and county level: Bromsgrove District Council and Worcestershire County Council. The district council is based at Parkside, at the corner of Market Street and Stourbridge Road. The main part of the urban area of Bromsgrove is an unparished area, although the urban area does extend into the neighbouring civil parish of Stoke.

Bromsgrove&#x27;s current Member of Parliament was elected in the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Bradley Thomas of the Conservative Party was elected to represent the Bromsgrove constituency, replacing Savid Javid. Albeit at a largely reduced majority. As a largely rural constituency with affluent residential areas, Bromsgrove District is strongly Conservative-supporting area, with further seats being won by the party in the local elections at the expense of &#x27;other&#x27; candidates.

The Bromsgrove constituency was last represented by Labour by Terry Davis, who defeated the Conservative Hal Miller as the result of 10.1% swing in a by-election in 1971. Miller was elected to the new Bromsgrove and Redditch constituency in 1974, and represented the Bromsgrove constituency from 1983 to 1992. He was succeeded by Roy Thomason, who was censured by the House of Commons Select Committee on Standards and Privileges for failing to declare loans made to him. He decided not to re-stand after the local Conservative Association opened nominations to other candidates. He was succeeded by Julie Kirkbride in 1997. She did not contest the seat in 2010 following the Westminster expenses scandal, in which she was found to have over-claimed by £29,243.

Bromsgrove has its own youth branch of Conservatives called Bromsgrove Conservative Future, a Labour Party and Labour club and a Liberal Democrat Party. Labour voting is strongest in the Hill Top, Sidemoor, Rock Hill and Charford wards of the town.

The town was also the host in the 2000s for the annual conference of the &quot;Bromsgrove Group&quot;, an organisation of monetary reformers, campaigning against debt-money, members of which have been suspected of far-right links.

== Demography ==
According to the 2001 census, the population of Bromsgrove is 29,237 and the population for the larger Bromsgrove District is 87,837, which grew to 99,200 in the 2021 census.

In Bromsgrove, White British is by far the largest ethnicity, at 96% of the district population (87,837) with 4% (3,734) from an ethnic minority.

== Geography ==
The solid geology of Bromsgrove is that of the Triassic (late Scythian to early Ladinian) Bromsgrove Sandstone. It shows red bed facies and was probably laid down by rivers flowing through an arid landscape or in ephemeral, shallow lakes. The uppermost beds were deposited by a brief marine transgression. The soil is very good for market gardening and growing vegetables due to Marl bands. The district is at a general elevation of between to above sea level.

=== Climate ===
Bromsgrove experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to almost all of the United Kingdom.

=== Landmarks ===

There is a statue of Alfred Edward Housman in the high street, which was erected in 1985. There is also a sculpture of a dryad and boar in the high street, commemorating the work of the Bromsgrove Guild.

Bromsgrove is home to Grafton Manor which dates back to the 14th century. It has a rich history, with one of the daughters of John Talbot married to Robert Wintour, who was involved in the Gunpowder plot.

== Economy ==
In 2004, 33,175 people in Bromsgrove District were in employment. Manufacturing, retail, and services were the biggest sectors of employment in 2001.

Many of Bromsgrove&#x27;s residents find employment in Birmingham, Redditch, Worcester and other places along the motorway network. MG Rover was a major employer of Bromsgrove residents until its collapse in May 2005. Bromsgrove is still home to LG Harris Ltd, a paint brush and decorator&#x27;s tool manufacturer in Stoke Prior (known locally as &quot;Harris Brush&quot; or just &quot;The Brush&quot;). Business parks in Aston Fields and Buntsford Hill are helping to revitalise the local economy, in addition to newer developments such as Saxon and Harris Business Parks. Bromsgrove District Council is aiming to create a technology corridor along the A38 to take advantage of the area&#x27;s road links.

== Facilities ==

=== Municipal facilities ===
Bromsgrove has a public community library situated in the centre of the town. The library offers not only books but also music CDs, spoken word, foreign-language tapes, and videos and DVDs for adults and children. There are 25 computers available with internet access.

Bromsgrove has a municipal park, Sanders Park. Facilities include: basketball courts, tennis courts, a skate park, children&#x27;s play area and football pitches. A bonfire night is held annually with a large fireworks display and fairground rides. Other events are held such as big band afternoons featuring bands playing in the bandstand.

There is a large public leisure centre and sports centre in the town called Bromsgrove Sports and Leisure Centre, formerly known as The Dolphin Centre. It has two swimming pools and a large sports hall. Numerous activities and clubs are held here, such as the Bromsgrove Swimming Club. It is owned by Bromsgrove District Council. Formerly run by Wychavon Leisure, the management of the centre was handed over to Everyone Active in 2017 as part of a £13.7 million refurbishment and renovation.

=== Transport ===
Bromsgrove is intersected by the A38 which was bypassed to the east of the town in 1980, the M5 motorway borders the west side and the M42 motorway starts at the north of the town.

Bromsgrove railway station is situated to the south of the town. It sits at the foot of the Lickey Incline which is the steepest Incline on the British mainline network meaning most freight trains require assistance from a locomotive at the rear. Between 1919 and 1956 this was operated by a purpose built locomotive known by drivers as Big Bertha. There are frequent trains to Birmingham New Street, Worcester Foregate Street and Hereford. On 4 May 2007, Network Rail announced that a new station would be built, to replace the existing structure, at a cost in the region of £10–12 million. The station opened in July 2016. Following completion of the electrification project, Bromsgrove is served by trains on the Cross City Line towards Lichfield. (These services previously terminated at Longbridge.)

There is also a bus station adjacent to the High Street. Buses operate to Redditch, Worcester, Kidderminster, Halesowen and Stourbridge operated by various operators. However the historic bus service 144, between Worcester and which continued to Birmingham remains in the hands of First Midland Red, the successor to Midland Red. From 1 May 2022, service 144 terminates at Catshill and no longer serves Birmingham.

<text>Newport is the county town of the Isle of Wight, an island county off the south coast of England. The town is slightly north of the centre of the island, located in the civil parish of Newport and Carisbrooke. It has a quay at the head of the navigable section of the River Medina, which flows northwards to Cowes and the Solent. The 2021 census recorded a population of 25,407.

==History==
Mousterian remains, featuring tools made by Neanderthals at least 40,000 years ago, were found at Great Pan Farm in the 1970s.

There are signs of Roman settlement in the area, which was probably known as &quot;Medina&quot;. They include two known Roman villas, one of which, Newport Roman Villa, has been excavated and opened to the public.

Information on the area resumes after the Norman Conquest. The first charter was granted in the late 12th century. In 1377 an invading French force burnt down much of the town while attempting to take Carisbrooke Castle, then under the command of Sir Hugh Tyrill. A group of Frenchmen were captured and killed, then buried in a tumulus later nicknamed Noddies Hill, a &quot;noddy&quot; being medieval slang for a body. This was later corrupted to Nodehill, the present name for a part of central Newport – a name that seems inappropriate, as the area is flat.

In 1648 Charles I and a group of Parliamentary Commissioners concluded the Treaty of Newport, an attempt to reach a compromise in the Civil War that was undermined by Charles&#x27;s negotiations with the French and Scots to intervene on his behalf. The Treaty was repudiated by Oliver Cromwell upon returning from defeating the Scots at the Battle of Preston. This led to Charles&#x27;s execution.

The town had been incorporated as a borough in 1608. The town&#x27;s position as an area of trade accessible to the sea meant it rapidly took over from nearby Carisbrooke as the main central settlement, eventually absorbing the latter as a suburb. The borough ceased to exist in 1974 when it was incorporated into the larger Borough of Medina, which was itself superseded in 1995 by a single unitary authority covering the whole of the Isle of Wight.

A school known as the Blue school focusing on the education of poor girls opened in the town in 1761. It closed in 1907.

The Drill hall in Newport opened as the headquarters of the Isle of Wight Rifle Volunteers in 1860.

Newport since the 1960s has acquired new shopping facilities and a pedestrianised central square. Through road traffic has ceased in many of the narrow streets. Newport Quay has been redeveloped with art galleries such as the Quay Arts Centre, and new flats converted from old warehouses.

The Queen Victoria Memorial was designed by local architect Percy Stone (1856–1934).

==Geography==
Geographically located in the centre of the Isle of Wight, at 50.701°N, 1.2883°W, Newport is the principal town on the island. It has public transport connections with all the island&#x27;s major towns. It serves as the island&#x27;s main shopping centre and location for public services. The main A3020 and A3054 roads converge as Medina Way between the busy roundabouts at Coppins Bridge and St Mary&#x27;s Hospital.

Newport railway station was the hub of the Island&#x27;s rail network until the mid-20th century, but closed in 1966. The site is now occupied by the dual-carriageway A3020 Medina Way.

The nearest city to the town is Portsmouth, about north-east on Portsea Island, adjoining the mainland. More locally, Ryde, the island&#x27;s largest town, is to the north-east. Sandown and Shanklin are to the east and Cowes to the north.

The River Medina runs through Newport. North of its confluence with the Lukely Brook at the town&#x27;s quay, it becomes a navigable tidal estuary.

Distance from surrounding settlements
*Cowes – 4.5 miles, 7 km
*East Cowes – 5 miles, 8 km
*Ryde – 7 miles, 11 km
*Shanklin – 9 miles, 15 km
*Sandown – 10 miles, 16 km
*Ventnor – 11 miles, 18 km
*Yarmouth, Isle of Wight – 10 miles, 16 km

==Prisons==
The town&#x27;s suburb of Parkhurst houses two Category B men&#x27;s prisons: Parkhurst Prison and Albany. Together they make up HMP Isle of Wight, which is one of the largest prisons in the UK. Parkhurst and Albany were once among the few top-security prisons in the United Kingdom. Camp Hill was another prison in the area, but it closed in 2013.

==Amenities==

Seaclose Park in Newport, on the east bank of the River Medina, has since 2002 been the location for the revived Isle of Wight Music Festival, which is held once a year. Newport is home to the Postal Museum, possibly the largest private collection of vintage postal equipment and post boxes in the world.

Newport bus station is the town&#x27;s central bus terminus. It acts as the hub of the Southern Vectis network, with routes from across the Island terminating there.

===Sport===
St George&#x27;s Park is the home of Newport Football Club, the most successful of the Island&#x27;s football teams, currently play in the Wessex League. The stadium has a capacity of 3,000. In 2018, an application was approved unanimously by the Isle of Wight council for a new stadium off the racecourse roundabout near Newport. This will be the new stadium for Newport (IW) F.C., so that St George&#x27;s Park can be turned into an out-of-town retail area. The town is also represented by Newport Cricket Club, which plays at Victoria recreation ground. Its two teams compete in Harwoods Renault Divisions 1 and 2. The Isle of Wight County Cricket Ground is located at Newclose, on the outskirts of the town.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the nearby Rowridge TV transmitter which is situated south west of the town. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Solent on 96.1 FM, Heart South on 97.5 FM, Capital South on 103.2 FM, Easy Radio South Coast on 107.4 FM, Nation Radio South Coast on 106.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South on 105.2 FM and community based stations: Vectis Radio on 104.6 FM and Isle of Wight Radio on 102.0 FM. 

The town is served by these local newspapers, &quot;Isle of Wight County Press&quot;, &quot;Isle of Wight Observer&quot; and &quot;Island Echo&quot;.

===Schools===
The town of Newport and the adjoining village of Carisbrooke together have seven primary schools, three secondary schools, a sixth-form campus, a further education college and two special schools. The primary schools located close to the town centre are Newport C of E Primary and Nine Acres Community Primary. Barton Primary is on Pan estate, while Summerfields Primary is nearby on the Staplers estate, both to the east of the town. Hunnyhill Primary is situated in Forest Road to the north of the town. There are two primary schools in Carisbrooke: Carisbrooke C of E Primary in Wellington Road and St Thomas of Canterbury Catholic Primary in the High Street, in the village centre.

The three secondary schools are Carisbrooke College, Medina College and Christ the King College. Carisbrooke College is located on a large site on the outskirts of Carisbrooke village, whilst Christ the King is just down the road, occupying two former middle school sites on opposite sides of Wellington Road. Medina College is situated to the east of the town, just off Fairlee Road, along with Medina Leisure Centre and Medina Theatre. The Island Innovation VI Form Campus is the joint sixth form for the Carisbrooke and Medina colleges. It is located in the town centre, on the site of the former Nodehill Middle School.

The Isle of Wight College stands to the north of the town centre, close to St Mary&#x27;s Roundabout and the large industrial estate. Medina House School is located between Pan and Staplers, and St Georges School to the south of the town in the suburban Watergate Road.

==Governance==
===Parliamentary representation===


From the Middle Ages the Parliamentary Borough of Newport had two seats in the House of Commons. Between 1807 and 1811 they were held by two future prime ministers: Arthur Wellesley, later to become the Duke of Wellington (who was also elected to two other seats at the same time) and Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston. Palmerston was eligible as an MP because his late father did not convert his Irish peerage into a United Kingdom peerage, which would have confined him to the House of Lords. The local patron arranging the deal was Sir Leonard Holmes, who made it a condition that they never visited the borough.

The borough was also represented by two other future prime ministers in the 1820s. George Canning was MP for Newport when appointed Prime Minister in 1827. However, under the law as it then stood, a minister accepting office automatically vacated his seat and had to stand for re-election to the Commons, and Canning chose to stand at Seaford, a government pocket borough in Sussex, rather than fight Newport again. However, in the by-election that followed at Newport, the town elected the Hon. William Lamb, later 2nd Viscount Melbourne, whose father had also represented the borough in the 1790s. However, Lamb remained MP for Newport for only two weeks, before also being elected for Bletchingley, which he preferred to represent.

Newport&#x27;s representation in Parliament was cut to one seat in 1867 and abolished altogether as a separate constituency in 1885. It was part of the Isle of Wight parliamentary constituency until 2024, and now belongs to the Isle of Wight West constituency.

===Local council===

Newport has had a variety of local government administrations.
*Until 1974 Newport had its own local authority, Newport Borough Council, which until 1967 was based at Newport Guildhall.
*In 1974–1995 Newport was under Medina Borough Council.
*In 1995 this was abolished and the Isle of Wight Council, based at County Hall, took over responsibility. Newport remained unparished until 2008.
*Newport Town Management Committee was established in April 2006 by the Isle of Wight Council as an interim body for the town until the Government gave approval for a parish or town council. The Management Committee had no formal powers and was technically no more than an advisory committee to the Isle of Wight Council. However, it was treated as a transitional authority, which acted in many ways as a town or parish council.
*The first election to Newport Parish Council occurred on 1 May 2008.

<doc id="351853" wikidata="Q1067156" url="?curid=351853" title="Dominated convergence theorem">
<text>In measure theory, Lebesgue&#x27;s dominated convergence theorem gives a mild sufficient condition under which limits and integrals of a sequence of functions can be interchanged. More technically it says that if a sequence of functions is bounded in absolute value by an integrable function and is almost everywhere point wise convergent to a function then the sequence converges in formula_1 to its point wise limit, and in particular the integral of the limit is the limit of the integrals. Its power and utility are two of the primary theoretical advantages of Lebesgue integration over Riemann integration.

In addition to its frequent appearance in mathematical analysis and partial differential equations, it is widely used in probability theory, since it gives a sufficient condition for the convergence of expected values of random variables.

==Statement==
Lebesgue&#x27;s dominated convergence theorem. Let formula_2 be a sequence of complex-valued measurable functions on a measure space . Suppose that the sequence converges pointwise to a function formula_3 i.e. 
:formula_4
exists for every formula_5. Assume moreover that the sequence formula_6 is dominated by some integrable function formula_7 in the sense that
: formula_8
for all points formula_9 and all formula_10 in the index set. 
Then formula_11 are integrable (in the Lebesgue sense) and
:formula_12.
In fact, we have the stronger statement
: formula_13
Remark 1. The statement &quot;formula_7 is integrable&quot; means that the measurable function formula_7 is Lebesgue integrable; i.e since formula_16.
:formula_17

Remark 2. The convergence of the sequence and domination by formula_7 can be relaxed to hold only formula_19-almost everywhere i.e. except possibly on a measurable set formula_20 of formula_19-measure formula_22. In fact we can modify the functions formula_6 (hence its point wise limit formula_3) to be 0 on formula_20 without changing the value of the integrals. (If we insist on e.g. defining formula_3 as the limit whenever it exists, we may end up with a non-measurable subset within formula_20 where convergence is violated if the measure space is non complete, and so formula_3 might not be measurable. However, there is no harm in ignoring the limit inside the null set formula_20). We can thus consider the formula_6 and formula_3 as being defined except for a set of formula_19-measure 0.

Remark 3. If formula_33, the condition that there is a dominating integrable function formula_7 can be relaxed to uniform integrability of the sequence (&quot;fn&quot;), see Vitali convergence theorem.

Remark 4. While formula_3 is Lebesgue integrable, it is not in general Riemann integrable. For example, order the rationals in formula_36, and let formula_6 be defined on formula_36 to take the value 1 on the first n rationals and 0 otherwise. Then formula_3 is the Dirichlet function on formula_36, which is not Riemann integrable but is Lebesgue integrable.
Remark 5 The stronger version of the dominated convergence theorem can be reformulated as: if a sequence of measurable complex functions formula_6 is almost everywhere pointwise convergent to a function formula_3 and almost everywhere bounded in absolute value by an integrable function then formula_43 in the Banach space formula_44

==Proof==
Without loss of generality, one can assume that &quot;f&quot; is real, because one can split &quot;f&quot; into its real and imaginary parts (remember that a sequence of complex numbers converges if and only if both its real and imaginary counterparts converge) and apply the triangle inequality at the end.

Lebesgue&#x27;s dominated convergence theorem is a special case of the Fatou–Lebesgue theorem. Below, however, is a direct proof that uses Fatou’s lemma as the essential tool.

Since &quot;f&quot; is the pointwise limit of the sequence (&quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;) of measurable functions that are dominated by &quot;g&quot;, it is also measurable and dominated by &quot;g&quot;, hence it is integrable. Furthermore, (these will be needed later),
: formula_45
for all &quot;n&quot; and
: formula_46
The second of these is trivially true (by the very definition of &quot;f&quot;). Using linearity and monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral,
: formula_47
By the reverse Fatou lemma (it is here that we use the fact that |&quot;f&quot;−&quot;fn&quot;| is bounded above by an integrable function)
: formula_48
which implies that the limit exists and vanishes i.e.
: formula_49
Finally, since
: formula_50
we have that
: formula_51
The theorem now follows.

If the assumptions hold only everywhere, then there exists a set such that the functions &quot;fn&quot; 1&quot;S&quot; \ &quot;N&quot; satisfy the assumptions everywhere on &quot;S&quot;. Then the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) defined as the pointwise limit of &quot;fn&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for and by for , is measurable and is the pointwise limit of this modified function sequence. The values of these integrals are not influenced by these changes to the integrands on this μ-null set &quot;N&quot;, so the theorem continues to hold.

DCT holds even if &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot; converges to &quot;f&quot; in measure (finite measure) and the dominating function is non-negative almost everywhere.

==Discussion of the assumptions==
The assumption that the sequence is dominated by some integrable &quot;g&quot; cannot be dispensed with. This may be seen as follows: define for &quot;x&quot; in the interval and otherwise. Any &quot;g&quot; which dominates the sequence must also dominate the pointwise supremum . Observe that
: formula_52
by the divergence of the harmonic series. Hence, the monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral tells us that there exists no integrable function which dominates the sequence on [0,1]. A direct calculation shows that integration and pointwise limit do not commute for this sequence:
: formula_53
because the pointwise limit of the sequence is the zero function. Note that the sequence (&quot;fn&quot;) is not even uniformly integrable, hence also the Vitali convergence theorem is not applicable.

==Bounded convergence theorem==
One corollary to the dominated convergence theorem is the bounded convergence theorem, which states that if (&quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a sequence of uniformly bounded complex-valued measurable functions which converges pointwise on a bounded measure space (i.e. one in which μ(&quot;S&quot;) is finite) to a function &quot;f&quot;, then the limit &quot;f&quot; is an integrable function and

:formula_54

Remark: The pointwise convergence and uniform boundedness of the sequence can be relaxed to hold only almost everywhere, provided the measure space is complete or &quot;f&quot; is chosen as a measurable function which agrees μ-almost everywhere with the everywhere existing pointwise limit.

===Proof===
Since the sequence is uniformly bounded, there is a real number &quot;M&quot; such that for all and for all &quot;n&quot;. Define for all . Then the sequence is dominated by &quot;g&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;g&quot; is integrable since it is a constant function on a set of finite measure. Therefore, the result follows from the dominated convergence theorem.

If the assumptions hold only everywhere, then there exists a set such that the functions &quot;fn&quot;1&quot;S&quot;\&quot;N&quot; satisfy the assumptions everywhere on &quot;S&quot;.

==Dominated convergence in &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;-spaces (corollary)==
Let formula_55 be a measure space, a real number and formula_2 a sequence of formula_57-measurable functions formula_58.

Assume the sequence formula_2 converges formula_19-almost everywhere to an formula_57-measurable function formula_3, and is dominated by a formula_63 (cf. Lp space), i.e., for every natural number formula_10 we have: formula_65, μ-almost everywhere.

Then all formula_6 as well as formula_3 are in formula_68 and the sequence formula_2 converges to formula_3 in the sense of formula_68, i.e.:

:formula_72

Idea of the proof: Apply the original theorem to the function sequence formula_73 with the dominating function formula_74.

==Extensions==
The dominated convergence theorem applies also to measurable functions with values in a Banach space, with the dominating function still being non-negative and integrable as above. The assumption of convergence almost everywhere can be weakened to require only convergence in measure.

The dominated convergence theorem applies also to conditional expectations.

<doc id="351855" wikidata="Q737510" url="?curid=351855" title="Pulmonary aspiration">
<text>Pulmonary aspiration is the entry of solid or liquid material such as pharyngeal secretions, food, drink, or stomach contents from the oropharynx or gastrointestinal tract, into the trachea and lungs. When pulmonary aspiration occurs during eating and drinking, the aspirated material is often colloquially referred to as &quot;going down the wrong pipe&quot;.

Consequences of pulmonary aspiration include no injury at all, chemical pneumonitis, pneumonia, or even death from asphyxiation. These consequences depend on the volume, chemical composition, particle size, and presence of infectious agents in the aspirated material, and on the underlying health status of the person.

In healthy people, aspiration of small quantities of material is common and rarely results in disease or injury. People with significant underlying disease or injury are at greater risk for developing respiratory complications following pulmonary aspiration, especially hospitalized patients, because of certain factors such as depressed level of consciousness and impaired airway defenses (gag reflex and respiratory tract antimicrobial defense system). About 3.6 million cases of pulmonary aspiration or foreign body in the airway occurred in 2013.

== Causes and Risk Factors ==

=== Neurologic Impairment ===
Any condition that results in depressed level of consciousness (such as traumatic brain injury, alcohol intoxication, drug overdose, medical sedation, stroke, and general anesthesia) can result in pulmonary aspiration of pharyngeal secretions. Neurologic conditions that affect muscle coordination and posture (such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, muscular dystrophies, etc.) can also increase risk of aspiration.

=== Pulmonary Disease ===
Patients with a poor ability to clear their airway of secretions are at an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration. This includes patients with pulmonary disease resulting in a weak cough, or poor forced expiratory volume. Any condition requiring mechanical ventilation is also at risk for aspiration.

=== Oropharyngeal Disorders ===
Conditions which disrupt coordination of swallowing above the glottis put a patient at increased risk for aspiration. This is referred to as oropharyngeal dysphagia and can be a result of structural abnormalities (strictures, stenosis, mediastinal and neck masses, etc.), connective tissue diseases, neuropathy, or other central nervous system-related disorders (stroke, head injury, ALS, Guillain-Barre, etc.).

=== Medications ===
Drugs can increase a person&#x27;s risk of aspiration through multiple mechanisms. Medications including sedatives, hypnotics, and antipsychotics can result in decreased level of consciousness and loss of cough and swallow reflexes. Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors can lead to overgrowth of gastric bacteria and increase risk of aspiration. Antihistamines and antidepressants can cause xerostomia (decreased oral secretions) which can also lead to aspiration.

=== Foreign-Body Aspiration ===
Particularly common in children, foreign-body aspiration occurs when an object is inhaled from the mouth into the airway. Objects commonly include food, coins, toys and balloons. Age and developmental delays are therefore also considered risk factors for aspiration. The lumen of the right main bronchus is more vertical and slightly wider than that of the left, so aspirated objects are more likely to end up in this bronchus or one of its subsequent bifurcations.

== Presentation ==
Uncomplicated aspiration events commonly present with symptoms including wheezing and coughing. Signs and symptoms that aspiration is complicated can include dyspnea (shortness of breath), hypoxemia (low oxygen in the blood), tachycardia (high heart rate), fever, and crackles or wheezes on lung exam.

== Evaluation ==
Evaluation and diagnosis of aspiration and aspiration-related complications may include imaging or laboratory studies.

=== Imaging ===
Radiologic studies may be done to image the chest wall, lungs, and airway to evaluate and diagnose conditions that may be contributing to aspiration, and also to diagnose complications of previous aspiration.

Chest X-rays can be useful in the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia but may be negative early in the course. Chest CT Scan can identify the presence of a pneumonia as well, and can also assist in characterizing abscesses, foreign objects, or pleural disease.

A fluoroscopic swallow study can be done in cases where dysphagia or motility disorders are thought to be the source of aspiration. Food and drink are mixed with barium contrast and monitored using x-ray to evaluate swallowing. Aspiration can be diagnosed if contrast is seen coursing below the vocal cords into the trachea.

=== Laboratory Studies ===
Microbiologic studies may be obtained in the case of suspected aspiration-related pulmonary infection. Labs may include infectious cultures of patient blood, sputum, or pleural fluid depending on the patient case and clinical judgement of the treatment team.

== Complications ==
=== Aspiration Pneumonia ===
Aspiration pneumonia is when bacteria is carried into the respiratory tract via aspiration and subsequently causes an infection of the lung. Any substance or object that is aspirated into the airway has the potential of carrying infectious agents with it into the respiratory tract. It primarily affects older adults and can be especially severe in patients with learning disabilities, or disorders of abnormal swallowing.

=== Aspiration Pneumonitis ===
Aspiration pneumonitis (Mendelson&#x27;s syndrome) is chemical injury of lung tissue secondary to aspiration of regurtitated gastric acid. The syndrome was first described among pregnant patients after the administration of anesthesia, though it can occur in any scenario where gastric contents are aspirated.

=== Death ===

Aspiration can result in patient death through a variety of mechanisms. It is important to recognize and diagnose early in order to improve patient outcomes. Death from aspiration and aspiration-related syndromes is most common in elderly patients with known baseline risk factors, though it frequently goes unrecognized.

== Prevention ==
The lungs are normally protected against aspiration by a series of &quot;protective reflexes&quot; such as coughing and swallowing. Significant aspiration can only occur if the protective reflexes are absent or severely diminished (in neurological disease, coma, drug overdose, sedation or general anesthesia). In intensive care, sitting patients upright reduces the risk of pulmonary aspiration and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Measures to prevent aspiration depend on the situation and the patient. In patients at imminent risk of aspiration, tracheal intubation by a trained health professional provides the best protection. A simpler intervention that can be implemented is to lay the patient on their side in the recovery position (as taught in first aid and CPR classes), so that any vomitus produced by the patient will drain out their mouth instead of back down their pharynx. Some anesthetists will use sodium citrate to neutralize the stomach&#x27;s low pH and metoclopramide or domperidone (pro-kinetic agents) to empty the stomach. In veterinary settings, emetics may be used to empty the stomach prior to sedation.

One strategy for prevention of aspiration in hospitalized patients with neurological disorders that impact swallowing is to place patients on a thickened fluids diet after swallowing assessment by a speech-language pathologist. However, the impact of diet-alteration is debated and may have an impact on patient quality of life. Also, pharyngeal residue is more common with very thickened fluids: this may subsequently be aspirated and lead to a more severe pneumonia.

== Management ==
See also: Choking § Treatment, Basic Life Support, Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support

Treatment of foreign body aspiration is determined by the age of the patient and the severity of obstruction of the airway involved.

=== Basic management ===

An airway obstruction can be partial or complete. In partial obstruction, the patient can usually clear the foreign body with coughing. In complete obstruction, acute intervention is required to remove the foreign body.

If foreign body aspiration is suspected, finger sweeping in the mouth is not recommended due to the increased risk of displacing the foreign object further into the airway.

For choking children less than 1 year of age, the child should be placed face down over the rescuer&#x27;s arm. Back blows should be delivered with the heel of the hand, then the patient should be turned face-up and chest thrusts should be administered. The rescuer should alternate five back blows followed by five chest thrusts until the object is cleared. The Heimlich maneuver should be used in choking patients older than 1 year of age to dislodge a foreign body. If the patient becomes unresponsive during physical intervention, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started.

=== Advanced management ===
In the event that the basic measures do not remove the foreign body, and adequate ventilation cannot be restored, need for treatment by trained personnel becomes necessary. Laryngoscopy should be performed in unresponsive patients if non-invasive airway clearance techniques are unsuccessful. Laryngoscopy involves placing a device in the mouth to visualize the back of the airway. If the foreign body can be seen, it can be removed with forceps. An endotracheal tube should then be placed in order to prevent airway compromise from resulting inflammation after the procedure. If the foreign body cannot be visualized, intubation, tracheotomy, or needle cricothyrotomy can be done to restore an airway for patients who have become unresponsive due to airway compromise.

If non-invasive measures do not dislodge the foreign body, and the patient can maintain adequate ventilation, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia should be performed. Supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and a pulse oximeter should be applied to the patient. Efforts should be made to keep the patient calm and avoid agitating the patient to prevent further airway compromise. Flexible rather than rigid bronchoscopy might be used when the diagnosis or object location are unclear. When flexible bronchoscope is used, rigid bronchoscope is typically on standby and readily available as this is the preferred approach for removal. Rigid bronchoscopy allows good airway control, ready bleeding management, better visualization, and ability to manipulate the aspirated object with a variety of forceps. Flexible bronchoscopy may be used for extraction when distal access is needed and the operator is experienced in this technique. Potential advantages include avoidance of general anesthesia as well as the ability to reach subsegmental bronchi which are smaller in diameter and further down the respiratory tract than the main bronchi. The main disadvantage of using a flexible scope is the risk of further dislodging the object and causing airway compromise. Bronchoscopy is successful in removing the foreign body in approximately 95% of cases with a complication rate of only 1%.

After the foreign body is removed, patients should receive nebulized beta-adrenergic medication and chest physiotherapy to further protect the airway. Steroidal anti-inflammatories and antibiotics are not routinely administered except in certain scenarios. These include situations such as when the foreign body is difficult or impossible to extract, when there is a documented respiratory tract infection, and when swelling within the airway occurs after removal of the object. Glucocorticoids may be administered when the foreign body is surrounded by inflamed tissue and extraction is difficult or impossible. In such cases, extraction may be delayed for a short course of glucocorticoids so that the inflammation may be reduced before subsequent attempts. These patients should remain under observation in the hospital until successful extraction as this practice can result in dislodgement of the foreign body. Antibiotics are appropriate when an infection has developed but should not delay extraction. In fact, removal of the object may improve infection control by removing the infectious source as well as using cultures taken during the bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic choice. When airway edema or swelling occur, the patient may have stridor. In these cases, glucocorticoids, aerosolized epinephrine, or helium oxygen therapy may be considered as part of the management plan.

Patients who are clinically stable with no need for supplemental oxygen after extraction may be discharged from the hospital the same day as the procedure. Routine imaging such as a follow-up chest x-ray are not needed unless symptoms persist or worsen, or if the patient had imaging abnormalities previously to verify return to normal. Most children are discharged within 24 hours of the procedure.

<text>Mouthbrooding, also known as oral incubation and buccal incubation, is the care given by some groups of animals to their offspring by holding them in the mouth of the parent for extended periods of time. Although mouthbrooding is performed by a variety of different animals, such as the Darwin&#x27;s frog, fish are by far the most diverse mouthbrooders. Mouthbrooding has evolved independently in several different families of fish.

==Mouthbrooding behaviour==
Paternal mouthbrooders are species where the male looks after the eggs. Paternal mouthbrooders include the arowana, various mouthbrooding bettas and gouramies such as &quot;Betta pugnax&quot;, and sea catfish such as &quot;Ariopsis felis&quot;. Among cichlids, paternal mouthbrooding is relatively rare, but is found among some of the tilapiines, most notably the black-chin tilapia &quot;Sarotherodon melanotheron&quot;.

In the case of the maternal mouthbrooders, the female takes the eggs. Maternal mouthbrooders are found among both African and South American cichlids. African examples are the haplochromines, such as the mbuna, &quot;Astatotilapia burtoni&quot;, and the dwarf mouthbrooders &quot;Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor&quot;, and some of the tilapiines, such as &quot;Oreochromis mossambicus&quot; and &quot;Oreochromis niloticus&quot;. The South American maternal mouthbrooders are all members of the subfamily Geophaginae (commonly known as &quot;eartheaters&quot; on account of their substrate-sifting feeding mode) such as &quot;Gymnogeophagus balzanii&quot; and &quot;Geophagus steindachneri&quot;.

Biparental mouthbrooding occurs where both parents take some of the eggs. This is relatively rare, but is found among the cichlid genus &quot;Xenotilapia&quot;, and a single catfish, the spatula-barbled catfish (&quot;Phyllonemus typus&quot;).

Typically, after courtship, the male fertilises the eggs and then collects them in his mouth, holding onto them until they hatch. During this time he cannot feed. Among the maternal mouthbrooding cichlids, it is quite common (e.g., among the mbuna) for the male to fertilise the eggs only once they are in the female&#x27;s mouth. Some cichlids are able to feed while mouthbrooding the eggs, but invariably they feed less often than they would otherwise do, and after mouthbrooding one batch of eggs, all mouthbrooding fish are underweight and require a period of time to feed and make up for the depletion of their energy reserves.

In all cases, the eggs are protected until they hatch and the fry become free swimming. Only in some cases does the parent extend protection to mobile juveniles. Among the cichlids and arowanas, extension of brood care to the fry is common, and they have behavioural cues to tell fry swimming and feeding away from the parent that danger is approaching and that they should return to their parent&#x27;s mouth. By caring for their offspring in this way, mouthbrooding fish are able to produce smaller numbers of offspring with a higher chance of survival than species that offer no broodcare.

==Aquaculture==
Some commercially important fish are mouthbrooders, most notably among the tilapiines and arowanas. Fry harvesting, getting the brooding fish to open its mouth and release the fry, is important if the fry are to be reared artificially. In the case of endangered species, such as Asian arowana, harvesting may be supervised by an official to certify that the fish farm is a genuine producer of captive-bred fish.

==Brood parasites==
Some fish have evolved to exploit the mouthbrooding behaviour of other species. &quot;Synodontis multipunctatus&quot;, also known as the cuckoo catfish, combines mouthbrooding with the behavior of a brood parasite: it eats the host mouthbrooder&#x27;s eggs, while spawning and simultaneously laying and fertilizing its own eggs. The mouthbrooder (typically a cichlid) incubates the cuckoo catfish young, the catfish eggs hatch earlier than the cichlid&#x27;s eggs, and eat the as-yet unhatched cichlid eggs before being set free.

==Families of mouthbrooding fish==
Families of fish known to include mouthbrooding species include:
* Apogonidae (cardinalfish): All paternal mouthbrooders
* Ariidae (sea catfish): All paternal mouthbrooders
* Bagridae (Bagrid catfish): the only mouthbrooding species in the family is &quot;Bagrus meridionalis&quot;, which is a biparental mouthbrooder
* Cichlidae (cichlids): Numerous species are mouthbrooders, typically maternal mouthbrooders. Some are paternal mouthbrooders e.g. &quot;Sarotherodon melanotheron&quot;, or biparental mouthbrooders e.g. eretmodine cichlids.
* Channidae (snakeheads): Some members of &quot;Channa&quot; are paternal mouthbrooders.
* Liparidae (snailfish): &quot;Careproctus ovigerus&quot; is the only species known to be a mouthbrooder (specifically paternal), but the breeding behavior of many other species in the family is unknown.
* Opistognathidae (jawfishes): All paternal mouthbrooders
* Osphronemidae (gouramis): A few genera (notably &quot;Betta&quot;, by far the largest genus) contain or consist entirely of paternal mouthbrooders. Two species of &quot;Sphaerichthys&quot; are maternal mouthbrooders.
* Osteoglossidae (arowanas): Some members are paternal mouthbrooders

<text>Kingsbridge is a market town in the South Hams district of Devon, England, with a population of 6,116 at the 2011 census. Two electoral wards bear the name of &quot;Kingsbridge&quot; (East &amp; North). Their combined population at the above census was 4,381. It is situated at the northern end of the Kingsbridge Estuary, a ria that extends to the sea south of the town. It is the third largest settlement in the South Hams and is southwest of Torquay and southeast of Plymouth.

==History==

The town formed around a bridge which was built in or before the 10th century between the royal estates of Alvington, to the west, and Chillington, to the east, hence giving it the name of Kyngysbrygge (&quot;King&#x27;s bridge&quot;). In 1219 the Abbot of Buckfast was granted the right to hold a market there, and by 1238 the settlement had become a borough. The manor remained in possession of the abbot until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when it was granted to Sir William Petre. Kingsbridge was never represented in Parliament or incorporated by charter, the local government being by a portreeve. It lay within the hundred of Stanborough.

Kingsbridge is in fact a combination of two towns, Kingsbridge and Dodbrooke. Dodbrooke was granted its own market in 1257 and had become a borough by 1319. While Dodbrooke was originally considered to be the dominant of the two, Kingsbridge later expanded to include it. The town consists of two ecclesiastical parishes: St. Edmund&#x27;s in the west and St. Thomas Becket at Dodbrooke in the east. St. Edmund&#x27;s Church, in mainly Perpendicular style, retains some 13th-century features including a font, but was enlarged and reconsecrated around 1414 and was mostly rebuilt in the 19th century. The parish church of St. Thomas Becket displays a particularly well-preserved rood screen, restored in 1897.

In 1798 the town mills were converted into a woollen manufactory, which produced large quantities of cloth, and serge manufacture was introduced early in the 19th century. During the 19th century the town had an active coastal shipping trade, shipbuilding, a tannery, other industries and a large monthly cattle market. The chief exports were cider, corn, malt, and slate.

Kingsbridge was used by Anthony Trollope as the setting for his novel &quot;Rachel Ray&quot; (1863) and by Rachel Joyce as the setting for her 2012 novel &quot;The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry&quot;. In October 2021 Embankment Films started filming in Kingsbridge for the big screen version of &quot;The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry&quot;, starring Jim Broadbent, Penelope Wilton, Monika Gossmann and Bethan Cullinane. The film was released in April 2023.

The town centre retains many 18th and 19th century buildings. The Shambles, or market arcade, was rebuilt in 1796 but retains its 16th century granite piers. The former grammar school, now a museum, was founded and built by Thomas Crispin in 1670.

==Modern day==
Kingsbridge has been the main market town in the area for centuries. Being situated within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and with its proximity to the south Devon coast and sailing venues such as Salcombe, the town has developed into a popular tourist destination. Its attractions include several restaurants, pubs, a cinema housed in the old Kingsbridge Town Hall building, and a museum devoted to the chemist William Cookworthy who was born in the town in 1705.

There are two supermarkets in Kingsbridge: a Morrisons and a Tesco Store, which opened in 2010. It also has a large secondary school, Kingsbridge Community College, which has over 1,000 pupils and serves the surrounding area. Kingsbridge was home to &quot;the only nightclub in the South Hams&quot;, &quot;Coast&quot; (which has since closed), with the next nearest club being in Torquay.

The town is linked to Plymouth and Dartmouth by the A379 road, and to Salcombe and Totnes by the A381. For seventy years it had a railway station until the branch line, via South Brent, was closed in 1963 as part of the Beeching cuts. An industrial estate now occupies the site of the former station yard, but a railway bridge and a short section of overgrown embankment can still be seen.

Kingsbridge has its own Parish Council with an elected Town Mayor.

<text>South Hams is a local government district on the south coast of Devon, England. Its council is based in the town of Totnes, although the largest town is Ivybridge. The district also contains the towns of Dartmouth, Kingsbridge and Salcombe and numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

Much of the district&#x27;s landscape is recognised for its natural beauty; the north of the district includes part of Dartmoor National Park, the district&#x27;s coastline and adjoining areas form most of the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and part of the west of the district lies within the Tamar Valley AONB. The district&#x27;s coast includes the promontories of Start Point and Bolt Head.

The neighbouring districts are Torbay, Teignbridge, West Devon, Cornwall (across the Tamar–Tavy Estuary) and Plymouth.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Ham&quot; is an Old English term which can mean a homestead, river meadow or peninsula. The settled farming areas either side of the largely uninhabited wilderness of Dartmoor were anciently termed the &quot;North Hams&quot; and &quot;South Hams&quot; respectively. The name North Hams fell out of general usage, but the name South Hams continued to be used for the area between Dartmoor and the south coast.

==History==
The South Hams were formerly part of the Brythonic (Celtic) Kingdom of Dumnonia. Post-Roman settlement on coastal promontory hillforts, such as Burgh Island, followed the established pattern of trading (particularly of tin) found across the western Atlantic coastal regions. The Anglo-Saxon conquest of south Devon was completed in the late 7th and early 8th centuries. In the later Anglo-Saxon era, the South Hams was a feudal estate consisting of all of the land between the River Plym and River Dart and south of Dartmoor with the English Channel forming the southern boundary. As a result of claims made by 19th century antiquarian Richard Polwhele, there is a popular belief that Cornish continued to be spoken in the area until the later middle ages and as late as the 14th century. However, there is, in fact, no evidence supporting this.

In 1917, the village of Hallsands was abandoned after much of it was lost to the sea following the removal of the shingle bank protecting the shore to help build Devonport dockyard.

In 1944 several villages were evacuated so that training for D-Day could be carried out in secret. The area was chosen because of the resemblance of its beaches to those of Normandy. Preparations were disrupted, and secrecy nearly compromised, by a devastating E-boat attack during Exercise Tiger.

The modern local government district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of seven former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Dartmouth Municipal Borough
*Kingsbridge Rural District
*Kingsbridge Urban District
*Plympton St Mary Rural District
*Salcombe Urban District
*Totnes Municipal Borough
*Totnes Rural District
The new district was named South Hams, using the long-established name for the area.

==Governance==
South Hams District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Devon County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the Dartmoor National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the Dartmoor National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 19-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1994 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at Follaton House, a large converted house on the outskirts of Totnes. The main house dates back to the early nineteenth century and is a Grade II* listed building. The building had been bought by the old Totnes Rural District Council for £26,000 in 1965 and converted to become its offices, transferring to the new South Hams District Council on local government reorganisation in 1974.

==Geography==
The district&#x27;s geography can be described in terms of three loosely-defined bands: a coastal band of bays, headlands, birdlife, fishing and small harbour towns with the estuaries and rias; a middle band with the main, well-conserved towns; and a sparsely populated band of upland National Park moorland in the north. For over a century its tourism was concentrated around the railway, with most stations built here from 1847 to 1872 so tourism to its beaches and fishing villages began in earnest later than to the &#x27;English Riviera&#x27; east of the area. South Hams&#x27; widespread tourism multiplied on the dualling of the A38 and time-cutting construction of the M5 and A303 across other parts of south-west England.

The South Hams, along with nearby Broadsands in Paignton, is the last British refuge of the cirl bunting.

==Parishes and settlements==
The whole district is covered by civil parishes. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council. The parish councils for Dartmouth, Ivybridge, Kingsbridge, Salcombe and Totnes take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

Settlements in the district include:
* Ash, Aish, Allaleigh, Ashprington, Aveton Gifford
* Badworthy, Bantham, Beesands, Beeson, Berry Pomeroy, Bickleigh, Bigbury-on-Sea, Bittaford, Blackawton, Blackpool, Bolberry, Brixton, Broadhempston, Buckland-Tout-Saints

* Ugborough, Uphempston
* Washbourne, Wembury, West Alvington, Woodleigh, Woolston Green, Wotter, Wrangaton
* Yealmpton

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 31 councillors representing 20 wards, with each ward election one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The South Hams district straddles the two parliamentary constituencies of South West Devon and Totnes.

In the 2016 EU Referendum it voted to remain with a very high (80.3%) turnout.

===Wards===
Some of the district&#x27;s wards are coterminous with civil parishes, though most consist of multiple parishes or parts of parishes. The following table lists the electoral wards of South Hams and the associated civil parishes.

<text>Argilophilus is a genus of western North American earthworms of the family Megascolecidae that are characteristically found under native vegetation.

The genus also occurs in subcontinental India, however, the single Australian report of the type species, Argilophilus marmoratus, is erroneous.

One enigmatic species, Argilophilus hyalinus Eisen, 1900, is reported from Guatemala - known only from the description of a single, macerated specimen.

&quot;Argilophilus&quot; and several other native genera form a close-knit group with nearest relatives apparently in Australia and Southeast Asia.

<text>Greg Thomey (born May 8, 1961) is a Canadian comedian, actor and playwright and a founding member of the long-running television program &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. He has been a recipient of numerous Gemini Awards.

Born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Thomey has been part of the comedy scene there for many years beginning as a writer and performer with the comedy troupe &quot;CODCO&quot; and as an actor and playwright.

He played the role of Brother Glackin in the film &quot;The Boys of St. Vincent&quot;. His original stage play &quot;Hanlon House&quot;, which was first produced by the Resource Centre for the Arts in St. John&#x27;s, went on to be produced as a short film, winning the Best Short Film award at the Atlantic Film Festival in 1992, and the Local Heroes Award at the Yorkton Film Festival in 1993. &quot;Hanlon House&quot; was aired on CBC-TV&#x27;s Arts program later that year.

In 1992, he began to work with Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer and Mary Walsh to create a new television series, which became &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. Thomey played anchorperson Frank MacMillan and created many memorable characters such as Jerry Boyle (of the Newfoundland Separation Federation) and Eddie from &quot;That Show Sucked&quot;. He left the show as an on-screen performer in 2005 but he returned to &quot;This Hour&quot; as a writer for the 2013/2014 season.

In addition to his work on &quot;22 Minutes&quot;, in 1996 Thomey also starred in a six-part series called &quot;Daily Tips for Modern Living&quot; that aired on CBC TV.

Thomey was not hired back for &quot;22 Minutes&quot; in August 2018, as several other long-time talent such as Shaun Majumder and multiple veteran writers were also not hired back.

In 2023, Thomey portrayed the character of Uncle Huey in the music video for Adam Baldwin&#x27;s song Lighthouse in Little Lorraine.

==Personal life==
In 2014, he was a co-complainant in a legal case in Nova Scotia in which a couple was accused of defrauding several investors including Thomey.

<text>Mary Cynthia Walsh (born May 13, 1952) is a Canadian actress, comedian, and writer. She is known for her work on &quot;CODCO&quot; and &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes.&quot;

== Early life ==
Walsh was born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, the daughter of Mary and Leo Walsh. Leo was a merchant marine turned firefighter on commercial vessels. She is the seventh of eight children, and is of Irish ancestry. She is a past member of Girl Guides of Canada.

==Career==
Walsh studied theatre in Toronto at Ryerson University but dropped out to work with the CODCO comedy troupe on a series of stage shows, which eventually evolved into a sketch comedy series. The &quot;CODCO&quot; series ran from 1988 to 1993 on CBC Television.

===&quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;===
In 1992, she began to work with former co-star Rick Mercer and former &quot;CODCO&quot; co-stars Cathy Jones and Greg Thomey to create a new television series called &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. The show was a parody of the nightly news, and poked fun at Canadian and international politics. &quot;22 Minutes&quot; received strong ratings during its earlier seasons and Walsh&#x27;s character Marg Delahunty became famous for buttonholing politicians and submitting them to satirical interviews. Usually Marg Delahunty would recite a scripted piece intended to humiliate the politician, often by providing criticism and &quot;grandmotherly&quot; advice. Sometimes Marg appeared as &quot;Marg, Princess Warrior&quot;, a parody of the title character of &quot;&quot; portrayed by Lucy Lawless. Walsh is also noted for her comical segment chronicling the Canadian Auto Workers Union&#x27;s tense blockade of the Volvo Halifax Assembly plant in 1998. In 2007, she revived Marg Delahunty for the Royal Canadian Air Farce&#x27;s 300th episode. On October 24, 2011, Walsh was once again in the spotlight as she reprised the role of Marg Delahunty conducting an ambush interview of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford at his home. Ford&#x27;s reaction and alleged verbal abuse directed at a 911 operator made national headlines. She also reprised Marg, Princess Warrior for an episode of the 25th season of &quot;22 Minutes&quot; in December 2017.

In 2020, Walsh reprised her longtime &quot;22 Minutes&quot; character of Miss Eulalia in the CBC Gem web series &quot;Broad Appeal: Living with E&#x27;s&quot;, for which she received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Lead Performance in a Web Program or Series at the 10th Canadian Screen Awards in 2022.

=== Other work ===
Walsh&#x27;s other television work included the short-run sitcoms &quot;Dooley Gardens&quot; (1999); &quot;Hatching, Matching and Dispatching&quot; (2006); and a guest starring role as Miranda Cahill on the CBC television series &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot;. She currently has a recurring role on CBC&#x27;s &quot;Little Dog&quot;. She created the CBC program &quot;Mary Walsh: Open Book&quot;, a talk show about books and literature, in 2003. Walsh revived the Fury family from &quot;Hatching, Matching, and Dispatching&quot; by writing and starring in &quot;A Christmas Fury&quot; in 2017&quot;.&quot;

Besides TV acting, she has worked on movies such as &quot;Mambo Italiano&quot;, &quot;Geraldine&#x27;s Fortune&quot;, &quot;Rain, Drizzle and Fog&quot;, &quot;Buried on Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Divine Ryans&quot;, &quot;Young Triffie,&quot; &quot;Violet,&quot; and &quot;The Grand Seduction&quot;.

2004 saw Walsh host a segment on the CBC documentary series &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;, in which she championed the case for Sir Frederick Banting (the Nobel prize-winning discoverer of insulin) as the greatest Canadian who ever lived.

In June 2007, she hosted the Pride Toronto Gala &amp; Awards ceremony.

On December 15, 2007, Walsh made national news with a story about her upcoming special, &quot;Nudity, Sexuality, Violence and Coarse Language&quot;, in which a large group of people who went and stripped naked standing next to St. John&#x27;s Harbour in −11 °C (12 °F) weather to be filmed as a part of the show&#x27;s closing. Walsh herself did not go nude.

In 2017, Walsh published her debut novel, &quot;Crying for the Moon&quot;.

===Directing===
Walsh made her feature directorial debut with the 2007 movie &quot;Young Triffie&quot;. She was the first Newfoundlander in six years to have a film in general release across Canada.

==Personal life==
Walsh has battled alcoholism. &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; reported that the end of CODCO coincided with the end of Walsh&#x27;s active alcoholism, with Walsh stating &quot;which was a damn good thing because I could have never done &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; if I&#x27;d been drinking.&quot;

== Honours ==

She won Best Supporting Actress at the Atlantic Film Festival in 1992 for her performance in Mike Jones&#x27; &quot;Secret Nation&quot;.

She has also served as a spokesperson for Oxfam, Canada&#x27;s human rights campaign, and in 2010 received Oxfam&#x27;s Spirit of Change Award, in recognition of her years of dedication to eradicating poverty and ensuring public services for all.

On May 29, 1998, Mary Walsh received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Trent University.

McGill University honoured Walsh with an honorary doctorate during the November 2008 convocation ceremony. Her speech to the class of 2008 focused on political satire.

===National Honours===
Mary Walsh was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada on 27 April 2000. This gave her the Post Nominal Letters &quot;CM&quot; for Life. She was awarded the Canadian Version of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002. She was awarded the Canadian Version of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

<doc id="351872" wikidata="Q3481577" url="?curid=351872" title="Shaun Majumder">
<text>Shaun Majumder is a Canadian actor and comedian. He is best known for his role on &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes,&quot; where he worked from 2003 until 2018. He won a Gemini Award for his work on the series in 2006.

==Early life==
Majumder was raised in Burlington, Newfoundland by his mother Marian Bartlett, a European-Canadian woman from Newfoundland, and Mani Majumder, a Bengali Hindu Indian father, originally from West Bengal. His parents separated after seven years. Majumder has an older sister named Rani.

Majumder has said that because he was raised by a white mother and around white people, he had no idea he &quot;was anything but white&quot;. In his standup acts, he jokes about joining his schoolmates in chanting racist slurs before realizing that he was the victim they were talking about. 
Majumder was very close to his mother who he says raised them selflessly so that he and his sister were unaware of the extreme poverty in which they lived. His mother died of a heart attack in 2003. 
Majumder feels a debt of love to Newfoundland which has influenced him and his work, and has given him a rhythm of appreciation for what he has.

==Career==
Majumder started his entertainment career as an announcer for the YTV game show &quot;CLIPS&quot;, and soon was hosting the network&#x27;s popular morning kids show &quot;Brain Wash&quot;, where he was known as Ed Brainbin. He also hosted the &quot;Slime Tour&quot; segments on the popular game show &quot;Uh Oh!&quot;. Eventually he joined &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; in 2003, and also hosted 15 episodes of the &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; specials on television and participated in the Comedy festivals in Montreal. He was also a star of &quot;Cedric the Entertainer Presents&quot;, aired in the United States on the Fox network, and appeared in an NFB documentary on aspiring Canadian comics, &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot;.

Majumder has also starred in the CBC comedy pilot &quot;Hatching, Matching and Dispatching&quot; and the short film &quot;Plain Brown Rapper,&quot; as well as playing Kumar&#x27;s brother in the 2004 comedy &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&quot;.

Majumder often plays an alter ego called Raj Binder. Binder is an awkward, nervous and usually excessively sweaty Indian reporter with a strong accent. Binder first appeared in a sketch from a comedy showcase with some former YTV costars called &quot;The Bobroom&quot;, and also appeared on &quot;Just For Laughs&quot; and &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. Majumder caused some minor controversy when &quot;Raj&quot; posed in the MegaStars group picture during the 2003 Heritage Classic NHL outdoor ice-hockey game. In 2006, Majumder won a Gemini Award for his work on &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;.

Majumder made a guest appearance on two episodes of the television series &quot;24&quot;, playing Hasan Numair. He also played Dr. Freddy Sahgal in the short-lived Fox TV series &quot;Unhitched&quot;, which aired in March 2008.

In 2010, Majumder had a guest starring role as Benny Natchie in &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot;, and from 2010 to 2011 starred in the American TV series &quot;Detroit 1-8-7&quot; as Detective Vikram Mahajan.

In the summer of 2011 Majumder was cast in &quot;The Firm&quot;, a Canadian-American co-production, in the recurring role of Andrew Palmer, the lawyer at the firm who befriends Josh Lucas&#x27; character Mitch McDeere. The show ran for one season.

From 2013 to 2014, Majumder starred in the documentary TV series &quot;Majumder Manor&quot;, which documented his quest to develop the tourism potential in his picturesque hometown of Burlington, Newfoundland. The show also featured his family, friends, and community.

In December 2016, Majumder starred in a controversial satirical short produced by &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, titled &quot;Beige Power&quot;, which called for white supremacists to &quot;embrace the beige&quot; and accept that humans will all &quot;look the same by the year 3000&quot;. The short received mixed reviews, with some criticising it for being racist, and others finding it humorous.

In August 2018, Majumder was not hired back for the next season of &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; after he sent a letter to the producers with suggestions on the future direction of the show. Citing creative differences with Majumder, the production team chose to cut ties.

==Personal life==
On 21 December 2012, Majumder married American actress Shelby Fenner. They have two daughters.

<doc id="351873" wikidata="Q264766" url="?curid=351873" title="Theresa May">
<text>Theresa Mary May, Baroness May of Maidenhead (; ; born 1 October 1956), is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from 2016 to 2019. She previously served as Home Secretary from 2010 to 2016. She was Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidenhead from 1997 to 2024, and has been a member of the House of Lords since August 2024. May was the second female British prime minister, after Margaret Thatcher, and the first woman to have held two of the Great Offices of State. May is a one-nation conservative.

May grew up in Oxfordshire and attended St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. After graduating in 1977, she worked at the Bank of England and the Association for Payment Clearing Services. She also served as a councillor on Merton London Borough Council. After two unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the House of Commons, she was elected MP for Maidenhead at the 1997 general election. From 1999 to 2010, May held several roles in shadow cabinets and was Chair of the Conservative Party from 2002 to 2003. Following the formation of the coalition government after the 2010 general election, May was appointed home secretary and minister for women and equalities, giving up the latter role in 2012. Reappointed after the Conservatives won the 2015 general election, she became the longest-serving home secretary in more than 60 years. During her tenure as home secretary, she pursued reform of the Police Federation, implemented a harder line on drugs policy and further restricted immigration. She oversaw the introduction of elected police and crime commissioners, the deportation of Abu Qatada and the creation of the College of Policing and the National Crime Agency. Although she supported the Remain campaign, May supported Brexit following the outcome of the 2016 referendum. She was elected and appointed prime minister unopposed, succeeding David Cameron.

As prime minister, May began the process of withdrawing the UK from the EU, triggering Article 50 in March 2017. In April, she announced a snap general election, with the aim of strengthening her hand in Brexit negotiations and highlighting her &quot;strong and stable&quot; leadership. This resulted in a hung parliament with the number of Conservative seats reduced to 317 from 330, despite the highest vote share since 1983 and the largest increase in electoral support enjoyed by a governing party since 1832. The loss of an overall majority prompted her to enter a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Following the 2017 election, May&#x27;s premiership continued to be dominated by Brexit, in particular by her government&#x27;s negotiations with the EU, adhering to the Chequers plan, which led to a draft Brexit withdrawal agreement. Other events that occurred during May&#x27;s premiership included terrorist attacks in Westminster, the Manchester Arena and London Bridge, and the Grenfell Tower fire and Windrush scandal. Her government announced the NHS Long Term Plan and was responsible for negotiating and approving the near-entirety of the UK&#x27;s terms of exit from the EU. May was also a prominent figure in leading the international condemnation and response to Russia over the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March 2018. May survived two votes of no confidence in December 2018 and in January 2019, but after versions of her draft withdrawal agreement were rejected by Parliament three times and her party&#x27;s poor performance in the 2019 European Parliament election, she left office in July and was succeeded by Boris Johnson, her former foreign secretary.

May remained in the House of Commons as a backbencher until she stood down at the 2024 general election. She was elevated to the House of Lords later that year as Baroness May of Maidenhead. In historical rankings of prime ministers, academics and journalists have ranked May in the bottom fourth quartile.

==Early life and education==
Theresa May was born on 1 October 1956 in Eastbourne, Sussex. She is the only child of Zaidee Mary (née Barnes; 1928–1982) and Hubert Brasier (1917–1981). Her father was a Church of England clergyman (and an Anglo-Catholic) who was chaplain of an Eastbourne hospital. He later became vicar of Enstone with Heythrop and finally of St Mary&#x27;s at Wheatley, to the east of Oxford. May&#x27;s mother was a supporter of the Conservative Party. Her father died in 1981, from injuries sustained in a car accident, and her mother of multiple sclerosis the following year. May later stated she was &quot;sorry they [her parents] never saw me elected as a Member of Parliament&quot;.

May initially attended Heythrop Primary School, a state school in Heythrop, followed by St. Juliana&#x27;s Convent School for Girls, a Roman Catholic independent school in Begbroke, which closed in 1984.

At the age of 13, May won a place at the former Holton Park Girls&#x27; Grammar School, a state school in Wheatley. During her time as a pupil, the Oxfordshire education system was reorganised, and the school became the new Wheatley Park Comprehensive School. May attended the University of Oxford, read geography at St Hugh&#x27;s College, and graduated with a second class BA degree in 1977. She was taught political geography at St Hugh&#x27;s by John Patten, Baron Patten, a future Conservative Secretary of State for Education under John Major. At St Hugh&#x27;s, May&#x27;s contemporaries included the barrister Alicia Collinson, wife of May&#x27;s future deputy Damian Green; businesswoman Louise Patten; and Emma Hood, wife of former Oxford University Vice-Chancellor John Hood.

May worked at a bakery on Saturdays to earn pocket money and was a &quot;tall, fashion-conscious young woman who from an early age spoke of her ambition to be the first woman prime minister,&quot; according to those who knew her. A university friend, Pat Frankland, said, &quot;I cannot remember a time when she did not have political ambitions.&quot;

==Early career==
Between 1977 and 1983, May worked at the Bank of England. From 1985 to 1997, she was a financial consultant at the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS). She served as Head of the European Affairs Unit from 1989 to 1996 and Senior Adviser on International Affairs from 1996 to 1997 in the organisation.

May served as a councillor for Durnsford ward on the Borough Council of the London Borough of Merton from 1986 to 1994, where she was Chairman of Education (1988–1990) and Deputy Group Leader and Housing Spokesman (1992–1994).

In the 1992 general election May was the Conservative Party candidate for the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, placing second to incumbent MP Hilary Armstrong, with future Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron placing third. May then stood at the 1994 Barking by-election, which was prompted by the death of Labour MP Jo Richardson. The seat had been continuously held by Labour since it was created in 1945, and Labour candidate Margaret Hodge was expected to win easily, which she did. May placed a distant third.

===Election===
Around 18 months ahead of the 1997 general election, May was selected as the Conservative candidate for Maidenhead, a new seat which was created from parts of the safe seats of Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham. She was elected comfortably with 25,344 votes (49.8%), almost double the total of second-placed Andrew Terence Ketteringham of the Liberal Democrats, who took 13,363 votes (26.3%). Despite this, her party suffered their worst defeat in over 150 years.

===Early parliamentary career===
Having entered Parliament, May became a member of William Hague&#x27;s front-bench Opposition team, as Shadow Spokesman for Schools, Disabled People and Women (1998–1999). She became the first of the 1997 MPs to enter the Shadow Cabinet when in 1999 she was appointed Shadow Education and Employment Secretary. After the 2001 election the new Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith kept her in the Shadow Cabinet, moving her to the Transport portfolio.

May was appointed the first female Chairman of the Conservative Party in July 2002. During her speech at the 2002 Conservative Party Conference, she explained why, in her view, her party must change: &quot;You know what people call us? The Nasty Party. In recent years a number of politicians have behaved disgracefully and then compounded their offences by trying to evade responsibility. We all know who they are. Let&#x27;s face it, some of them have stood on this platform.&quot; She accused some unnamed colleagues of trying to &quot;make political capital out of demonising minorities&quot;, and charged others with indulging themselves &quot;in petty feuding or sniping instead of getting behind a leader who is doing an enormous amount to change a party which has suffered two landslide defeats&quot;. She admitted that constituency selection committees seemed to prefer candidates they would &quot;be happy to have a drink with on a Sunday morning&quot;, continuing to say, &quot;At the last general election 38 new Tory MPs were elected. Of that total, only one was a woman and none was from an ethnic minority. Is that fair? Is one half of the population entitled to only one place out of 38?&quot;

In 2003, after Michael Howard&#x27;s election as Conservative Party and Opposition Leader in November that year, May was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Transport and the Environment.

In June 2004, she was moved to become Shadow Secretary of State for the Family. Following the 2005 general election she was also made Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. After David Cameron&#x27;s election as Conservative Party and Opposition Leader, he appointed May as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons in December 2005 and as Shadow Minister for Women and Equality in July 2007. In January 2009, May was made Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.

On 6 May 2010, May was re-elected MP for Maidenhead with an increased majority of 16,76960% of the vote. This followed an earlier failed attempt by the Liberal Democrats to unseat her in 2005, as one of that party&#x27;s leading &quot;decapitation-strategy&quot; targets.

==Home Secretary==
Following the formation of the coalition government after the 2010 general election on 12 May 2010, May was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities by Prime Minister David Cameron as part of his first Cabinet. She became the fourth woman to hold one of the British Great Offices of State, after Margaret Thatcher (Prime Minister), Margaret Beckett (Foreign Secretary) and Jacqui Smith (Home Secretary). As Home Secretary, May was also a member of the National Security Council. She was the longest-serving Home Secretary for over 60 years, since James Chuter Ede who served over six years and two months from August 1945 to October 1951. May&#x27;s appointment as Home Secretary was somewhat unexpected, with Chris Grayling having served as shadow Home Secretary in opposition.

May&#x27;s debut as Home Secretary involved overturning several of the previous Labour government&#x27;s measures on data collection and surveillance in England and Wales. By way of a government bill which became the Identity Documents Act 2010, she brought about the abolition of the Labour government&#x27;s National Identity Card and database scheme and reformed the regulations on the retention of DNA samples for suspects and controls on the use of CCTV cameras. In May 2010, May announced the adjournment of the deportation to the United States of alleged computer hacker Gary McKinnon. She also suspended the registration scheme for carers of children and vulnerable people, with May saying that the measures were &quot;draconian. You were assumed to be guilty until you were proven innocent, and told you were able to work with children.&quot; On 4 August 2010, it was reported that May was scrapping the former Labour government&#x27;s proposed &quot;go orders&quot; scheme to protect women from domestic violence by banning abusers from the victim&#x27;s home.

In June 2010, May faced her first major national security incident as Home Secretary with the Cumbria shootings. She delivered her first major speech in the House of Commons as Home Secretary in a statement on this incident, later visiting the victims with the Prime Minister. Also in June 2010, May banned the Indian Muslim preacher Zakir Naik from entering the United Kingdom.

According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, a Home Office official who disagreed with this decision was suspended. In late June 2010, May announced plans for a temporary cap on UK visas for non-EU migrants. The move raised concerns about the impact on the British economy.

In August 2013, May supported the detention of David Miranda, partner of &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Glenn Greenwald, under the Terrorism Act 2000, saying that critics of the Metropolitan Police action needed to &quot;think about what they are condoning&quot;. Lib Dem peer and former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald accused May of an &quot;ugly and unhelpful&quot; attempt to implicate those who were concerned about the police action of &quot;condoning terrorism&quot;. The High Court subsequently acknowledged there were &quot;indirect implications for press freedom&quot; but ruled the detention legal. A 2016 ruling by the Court of Appeal found that the provision of the Terrorism Act used for Miranda&#x27;s detention was &quot;incompatible with the European convention on human rights&quot;, but that the detention itself was lawful.

May also championed legislation popularly dubbed the Snooper&#x27;s Charter, requiring internet and mobile service providers to keep records of internet usage, voice calls, messages and email for up to a year in case police requested access to the records while investigating a crime. The Liberal Democrats had blocked the first attempt, but after the Conservative Party obtained a majority in the 2015 general election May announced a new Draft Investigatory Powers Bill similar to the Draft Communications Data Bill, although with more limited powers and additional oversight.

===Police and crime===

Speaking at the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) conference in June 2010, May announced radical cuts to the Home Office budget, likely to lead to a reduction in police numbers. In July 2010, May presented the House of Commons with proposals for a fundamental review of the previous Labour government&#x27;s security and counter-terrorism legislation, including &quot;stop and search&quot; powers, and her intention to review the 28-day limit on detaining terrorist suspects without charge.

In July 2010, May announced a package of reforms to policing in England and Wales in the House of Commons. The previous Labour Government&#x27;s central crime agency, Soca (Serious Organised Crime Agency), was to be replaced by a new National Crime Agency. In common with the Conservative Party 2010 general election manifesto&#x27;s flagship proposal for a &quot;Big Society&quot; based on voluntary action, May also proposed increasing the role of civilian &quot;reservists&quot; for crime control. The reforms were rejected by the Opposition Labour Party.

Following the actions of some members of Black Bloc in vandalising allegedly tax-avoiding shops and businesses on the day of the March 2011 TUC march, the Home Secretary unveiled reforms curbing the right to protest, including giving police extra powers to remove masked individuals and to police social networking sites to prevent illegal protest without police consent or notification.

In 2012, despite inquiries by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruling that there was no new evidence to warrant further investigation, after discussions with Doreen Lawrence, May commissioned Mark Ellison to review Scotland Yard&#x27;s investigations into alleged police corruption. The report was presented to Parliament by May on 6 March 2014. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police said the report, which has prompted an inquiry into undercover policing, was &quot;devastating&quot;.

In July 2013, May welcomed the fact that crime had fallen by more than 10% under the coalition government, while still being able to make savings. She said that this was partly due to the government removing red tape and scrapping targets to allow the police to concentrate on crime-fighting.

In 2014, May delivered a speech to the Police Federation, in which she criticised aspects of the culture of the police force. In the speech, she said:

On 9 December 2010, in the wake of violent student demonstrations in central London against increases to higher-education tuition fees, May praised the actions of the police in controlling the demonstrations but was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;under growing political pressure&quot; due to her handling of the protests.

In December 2010, May declared that deployment of water cannon by police forces in mainland Britain was an operational decision which had been &quot;resisted until now by senior police officers.&quot; She rejected their use following the widespread rioting in summer 2011 and said: &quot;the way we police in Britain is not through use of water cannon. The way we police in Britain is through consent of communities.&quot; May said: &quot;I condemn utterly the violence in Tottenham... Such disregard for public safety and property will not be tolerated, and the Metropolitan Police have my full support in restoring order.&quot;

In the aftermath of the riots May urged the identification of as many as possible of the young criminals involved. She said: &quot;when I was in Manchester last week, the issue was raised to me about the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of crimes of this sort. The Crown Prosecution Service is to order prosecutors to apply for anonymity to be lifted in any youth case they think is in the public interest. The law currently protects the identity of any suspect under the age of 18, even if they are convicted, but it also allows for an application to have such restrictions lifted, if deemed appropriate.&quot; May added that &quot;what I&#x27;ve asked for is that CPS guidance should go to prosecutors to say that where possible, they should be asking for the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of criminal activity to be lifted&quot;.

====Anti-social behaviour====
In July 2010, May proposed to review the previous Labour Government&#x27;s anti-social behaviour legislation signalling the abolition of the &quot;Anti-Social Behaviour Order&quot; (ASBO). She identified the policy&#x27;s high level of failure with almost half of ASBOs breached between 2000 and 2008, leading to &quot;fast-track&quot; criminal convictions. May proposed a less punitive, community-based approach to tackling social disorder. May suggested that anti-social behaviour policy &quot;must be turned on its head&quot;, reversing the ASBO&#x27;s role as the flagship crime control policy legislation under Labour. Former Labour Home Secretaries David Blunkett (who introduced ASBOs) and Alan Johnson expressed their disapproval of the proposals.

====Drug policy====
In July 2013, May decided to ban the stimulant khat, against the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The council reached the conclusion that there was &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; it caused health problems. Explaining the change in the classification May said: &quot;The decision to bring khat under control is finely balanced and takes into account the expert scientific advice and these broader concerns&quot;, and pointed out that the product had already been banned in the majority of other EU member states, as well as most of the G8 countries including Canada and the US. A report on khat use by the ACMD published in January 2013 had noted the product had been associated with &quot;acute psychotic episodes&quot;, &quot;chronic liver disease&quot; and family breakdown. However, it concluded that there is no risk of harm for most users, and recommended that khat remain uncontrolled due to lack of evidence for these associations.

Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker accused May of suppressing proposals to treat rather than prosecute minor drug offenders from a report into drug policy commissioned by the Home Office. The Home Office denied that its officials had considered this as part of their strategy. Baker cited difficulties in working with May as the reason for his resignation from the Home Office in the run-up to the 2015 general election.

===Immigration===
In 2010, May promised to bring the level of net migration down to less than 100,000. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported in February 2015, &quot;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014—up from 210,000 in the previous year.&quot; In total, 624,000 people migrated to the UK in the year ending September 2014 and 327,000 left in the same period. Statistics showed &quot;significant increases in migration among both non-EU citizens—up 49,000 to 292,000—and EU citizens, which rose by 43,000 to 251,000.&quot;

In May 2012 she told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of her intention &quot;to create here in Britain a really hostile environment for illegal migration&quot;.

May rejected the European Union&#x27;s proposal of compulsory refugee quotas. She said that it was important to help people living in war-zone regions and refugee camps but &quot;not the ones who are strong and rich enough to come to Europe&quot;. In May 2016, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that she had tried to save £4m by rejecting an intelligence project to use aircraft surveillance to detect illegal immigrant boats.

====Family migration====
In June 2012, May announced that new restrictions would be introduced to reduce the number of non-European Economic Area family migrants. The changes were mostly intended to apply to new applicants after 9 July 2012.

The newly introduced rules came into effect on 9 July 2012 allowing only those British citizens earning more than £18,600 to bring their spouses or their children to live with them in the UK. This figure would rise significantly in cases where visa applications are also made for children. They also increased the current two-year probationary period for partners to 5 years. The rules also prevent any adult and elderly dependents from settling in the UK unless they can demonstrate that, as a result of age, illness or disability, they require a level of long-term personal care that can only be provided by a relative in the UK.

The House of Lords was concerned about the immigration issue and therefore addressed the PM in Parliament as to whether she had examined the impact on communities and families on modest incomes, but it received no direct response. The human rights group Liberty concluded that the new rules showed scant regard to the impact they would have on genuine families. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration conducted an evidence based inquiry into the impact of the rules and concluded in their report that the rules were causing very young children to be separated from their parents and could exile British citizens from the UK.

====Deportation decisions====

At the Conservative Party Conference in October 2011, while arguing that the Human Rights Act needed to be amended, May gave the example of a foreign national who the Courts ruled was allowed to remain in the UK, &quot;because—and I am not making this up—he had a pet cat&quot;. In response, the Royal Courts of Justice issued a statement, denying that this was the reason for the tribunal&#x27;s decision in that case, and stating that the real reason was that he was in a genuine relationship with a British partner, and owning a pet cat was simply one of many pieces of evidence given to show that the relationship was &quot;genuine&quot;. The Home Office had failed to apply its own rules for dealing with unmarried partners of people settled in the UK. Amnesty International said May&#x27;s comments only fuelled &quot;myths and misconceptions&quot; about the Human Rights Act and Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke subsequently called May&#x27;s comments &quot;laughable and childlike.&quot;

In June 2012, May was found in contempt of court by Judge Barry Cotter, and stood accused of &quot;totally unacceptable and regrettable behaviour&quot;, being said to have shown complete disregard for a legal agreement to free an Algerian from a UK Immigration Detention Centre. As she eventually allowed the prisoner to be freed, May avoided further sanctions including fines or imprisonment.

May responded to a Supreme Court decision in November 2013 to overturn her predecessor Jacqui Smith&#x27;s revocation of Iraqi-born terror suspect Al Jedda&#x27;s British citizenship by ordering it to be revoked for a second time, making him the first person to be stripped twice of British citizenship.

May was accused by Lord Roberts of Llandudno of being willing to allow someone to die &quot;to score a political point&quot; over the deportation of mentally ill Nigerian man Isa Muazu. According to Muazu&#x27;s solicitor, May had arranged for the asylum seeker, who was said to be &quot;near death&quot; after a 100-day hunger strike, to be deported by a chartered private jet. To strengthen the Home Office&#x27;s tough stance, an &quot;end of life&quot; plan was reportedly offered to Muazu, who was one of a number of hunger strikers at the Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre.

====Abu Qatada deportation====
In July 2013, Abu Qatada, a radical cleric arrested in 2002, was deported to Jordan after a decade-long battle that had cost the nation £1.7 million in legal fees, and several prior Home Secretaries had not resolved. The deportation was the result of a treaty negotiated by May in April 2013, under which Jordan agreed to give Qatada a fair trial, by not using evidence that may have been obtained against him through torture.

May pointed to Qatada&#x27;s deportation as a triumph, guaranteeing in September 2013 that &quot;he will not be returning to the UK&quot;, and declaring in her 2016 leadership campaign announcement that she was told that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t deport Abu Qatada&quot; but that she &quot;flew to Jordan and negotiated the treaty that got him out of Britain for good&quot;. The Qatada deportation also shaped May&#x27;s views on the European Convention on Human Rights and European Court of Human Rights, saying that they had &quot;moved the goalposts&quot; and had a &quot;crazy interpretation of our human rights laws&quot;, as a result, May has since campaigned against the institutions, saying that British withdrawal from them should be considered.

====&quot;Go Home&quot; advertisements====

In August 2013, the Home Office engaged in an advertising campaign directed at illegal immigrants. The advertisements, in the form of mobile advertising hoardings on the back of lorries, told illegal immigrants to &quot;go home or face arrest&quot;, with an image of a person in handcuffs, and were deployed in six London boroughs with substantial ethnic minority populations. They were widely criticised as creating a hostile atmosphere for members of ethnic minority groups. The shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, described their language as being reminiscent of that used by the National Front in the 1970s. An adjudication by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that &quot;the claim [that 106 arrests were made last week] was misleading and had not been substantiated&quot; was followed by the advertisements being withdrawn after being banned by the ASA.

====Passport backlog====
In mid 2014, the Passport Office faced a backlog in developing processing passport applications, with around 30,000 applications hit by delays. David Cameron suggested this had come about due to the Passport Office&#x27;s receiving an &quot;above normal&quot; 300,000-rise in applications. It was revealed, however, that May had been warned the year before, in July 2013, that a surge of 350,000 extra applications could occur owing to the closure of processing overseas under Chancellor Osborne&#x27;s programme of cuts. Around £674,000 was paid to staff who helped clear the backlog.

====Windrush scandal====

In April 2018, May&#x27;s hostile environment policy became the focus of British politics in what came to be known as the Windrush scandal, in which members of the Windrush generation of Afro-Caribbean Britons were threatened with deportation by the Home Office and in at least 83 cases, illegally deported from the UK. The policy also affected the lives of many thousands of people who were in the United Kingdom legally by causing them to be sacked from employment, preventing access to health care, illegally demanding money, exiling them and preventing their return to the UK, and leaving them destitute. The scandal led to the resignation of May&#x27;s successor Amber Rudd as Home Secretary, and her replacement by Sajid Javid. Responding to questions in Parliament on the Windrush scandal on 25 April, May maintained that the hostile environment policy would remain government policy.

===Birmingham schools row===
In June 2014, an inflamed public argument arose between Home Office and Education Ministers about responsibility for alleged extremism in Birmingham schools. Prime Minister David Cameron intervened to resolve the row, insisting that May sack her Special Advisor Fiona Cunningham (now Hill) for releasing on May&#x27;s website a confidential letter to May&#x27;s colleagues, and that Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, apologise to the Home Office&#x27;s head of Security and Counter-Terrorism, Charles Farr, for uncomplimentary briefings of him appearing on the front page of &quot;The Times&quot;.

=== Minister for Women and Equalities ===
May held the office of Minister for Women and Equalities in parallel to her office of Home Secretary from 2010 to September 2012, when this role was taken over by Maria Miller.

May&#x27;s appointment as Minister for Women and Equalities was controversial, and was met with criticism by many in the LGBT community due to May&#x27;s record of consistently opposing LGBT rights from 1997 to 2004: she voted against equalising the age of consent in 1998, she spoke in favour of Section 28 in 2001, and she spoke against greater adoption rights for homosexuals in 2002. May later stated, during an appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; in 2010, that she had &quot;changed her mind&quot; on gay adoption. Writing for &quot;PinkNews&quot; in June 2010, May detailed proposals for improving LGBT rights including measures to tackle homophobia in sport, advocating British society&#x27;s need for &quot;cultural change&quot;.

In July 2010, May stated she would be supporting the previous Labour Government&#x27;s Anti-Discrimination Laws enshrined in the Equality Act 2010 despite having previously opposed it. The Equality Act came into effect in England, Wales and Scotland on 1 October 2010. She did however announce that a clause she dubbed &quot;Harman&#x27;s Law&quot; which would have required public bodies to consider how they can reduce socio-economic inequalities when making decisions about spending and services would be scrapped on the grounds that it was &quot;unworkable&quot;.

===Leadership bid===
In June 2016, May announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party to succeed David Cameron, who resigned following the outcome of the European Union membership referendum in which 52 per cent of voters voted in favour of leaving the EU. May emphasised the need for unity within the party regardless of positions on leaving the EU, saying she could bring &quot;strong leadership&quot; and a &quot;positive vision&quot; for the country&#x27;s future. Despite having backed a vote to remain in the EU, she insisted that there would be no second referendum, saying: &quot;The campaign was fought... and the public gave their verdict. There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door... Brexit means Brexit&quot;. An opinion poll that day found 47 per cent of people choosing May as their preferred candidate to be prime minister.

May&#x27;s supporters included a number of Cabinet ministers, such as Amber Rudd, Chris Grayling, Justine Greening, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Fallon and Patrick McLoughlin. She received the most votes in the first round of voting on 5 July, receiving support from 165 MPs, with rivals Andrea Leadsom receiving 66 votes and Michael Gove 48. The two candidates with the fewest votes, Liam Fox and Stephen Crabb, immediately announced their support for May. May came in first place in the second ballot on 7 July with an overwhelming majority of 199 MPs, compared with 84 for Leadsom and 46 for Gove, who was eliminated. Afterwards, May stated that she was delighted with her support among MPs, and she progressed to a vote of the Conservative Party membership against Leadsom.

In July, Leadsom announced her withdrawal from the leadership contest hours after May had made her first official campaign speech, saying her lack of support amongst Conservative MPs compared to May would be too great a hindrance to becoming a credible prime minister. As the sole remaining candidate, May was formally declared Leader of the Conservative Party that evening.

==Premiership (2016–2019)==
===Appointment===

On 13 July 2016, two days after becoming Leader of the Conservative Party, May was appointed prime minister by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher. Addressing the world&#x27;s media outside 10 Downing Street, May said that she was &quot;honoured and humbled&quot; to become prime minister. On becoming prime minister, May became the first woman to have held two of the Great Offices of State.

Responding to some calls for an early general election, &quot;sources close to Mrs May&quot; said there was no need for such an election. In a speech after her appointment, May emphasised the term &quot;Unionist&quot; in the name of the Conservative Party, reminding all of &quot;the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&quot; By 15 July, May had travelled to Edinburgh to meet with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to reinforce the bond between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. &quot;I&#x27;m coming here to show my commitment to preserving this special union that has endured for centuries,&quot; she explained.

===Cabinet changes===
May&#x27;s first Cabinet appointment was described by Reuters as &quot;one of the most sweeping government reshuffles for decades&quot;, and called &quot;a brutal cull&quot; by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Nine of Cameron&#x27;s ministers, including several prominent members, were sacked or resigned from their posts. The early appointments were interpreted both as an effort to reunite the Conservative Party in the wake of the UK&#x27;s vote to leave the EU and as &quot;a shift to the right,&quot; according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. ITV&#x27;s Political Editor Robert Peston commented: &quot;Her rhetoric is more left-wing than Cameron&#x27;s was, her cabinet is more right-wing than his was.&quot; Although May had supported remaining in the EU, she appointed several of the most prominent advocates of Brexit to key Cabinet positions responsible for negotiating the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union, including Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary, David Davis as Brexit Secretary, and Liam Fox as International Trade Secretary, the latter two being new positions. Other key appointees included Amber Rudd as Home Secretary and Philip Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

=== First term (2016–2017) ===

The First May ministry delayed the final approval for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in July 2016, a project which May had objected to when she was Home Secretary. Her political adviser Nick Timothy wrote an article in 2015 to oppose China&#x27;s involvement in sensitive sectors. He said that the government was &quot;selling our national security to China&quot; without rational concerns and &quot;the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies&quot;.

In July 2016, when George Kerevan asked her whether she would be prepared to authorise the killing of a hundred thousand innocent persons by a nuclear strike; during the &quot;Trident debate&quot; inside the House of Commons, May said &quot;Yes. And I have to say to the honourable gentleman: the whole point of a deterrent is that our enemies need to know that we would be prepared to use it. Unlike some suggestions that we could have a nuclear deterrent but not actually be willing to use it, which come from the Labour Party frontbench.&quot;

On 20 July, May attended her first Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions since taking office, then afterwards made her first overseas trip as prime minister, visiting Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. During the visit, May said that she would not trigger Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon—the process for withdrawing from the European Union—before 2017, suggesting it would take time for the UK to negotiate a &quot;sensible and orderly departure&quot; from the EU. However, although Merkel said it was right for the UK to &quot;take a moment&quot; before beginning the process, she urged May to provide more clarity on a timetable for negotiations. Shortly before travelling to Berlin, May had also announced that in the wake of the referendum, Britain would relinquish the presidency of the Council of the European Union, which passes between member states every six months on a rotation basis, and that the UK had been scheduled to hold in the second half of 2017.

May supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and defended selling arms to Saudi Arabia, which is accused of committing war crimes in Yemen, insisting that Britain&#x27;s close relationship with Saudi Arabia was &quot;helping keep people on the streets of Britain safe&quot;.
On 21 January 2017, following the inauguration of Donald Trump as US President, the White House announced that May would meet the President on 27 January, making her the first foreign leader to meet Trump since he took office on 20 January. In a joint press conference, May indicated an interest in increased trade between the United States and the United Kingdom. She also affirmed a desire to maintain an American involvement in NATO. May was criticised by members of major parties, including her own, for refusing to condemn Trump&#x27;s Executive Order 13769, as well as for inviting Trump to a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II.

In January 2017, when it came to light that a Trident test had malfunctioned in June 2016, May refused to confirm whether she knew about the incident when she addressed parliament.

May&#x27;s Chancellor, Philip Hammond, continued government policies of freezing benefits in his 2017 budget.

===2017 general election===

In May announced that she would call a parliamentary vote to hold an early general election on 8 June, saying that it was the &quot;only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead&quot;. May had previously ruled out an early election on five occasions over nine months. The election was the first snap election held under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 after MPs gave May the two-thirds super-majority required.

Unveiling the Conservative manifesto in Halifax on 18 May, May promised a &quot;mainstream government that would deliver for mainstream Britain&quot;. It proposed to balance the budget by 2025, raise spending on the NHS by £8bn per annum and on schools by £4bn per annum by 2022, remove the ban on new grammar schools, means-test the winter fuel allowance, replace the state pension &quot;triple lock&quot; with a &quot;double lock&quot; and require executive pay to be approved by a vote of shareholders. It also contained May&#x27;s previously-announced flagship energy reform of a cap on gas and electricity bills for households on standard variable tariffs. It dropped the 2015 pledge to not raise income tax or national insurance contributions but maintained a commitment to freeze VAT. New sovereign wealth funds for infrastructure, rules to prevent foreign takeovers of &quot;critical national infrastructure&quot; and institutes of technology were also proposed. The manifesto was noted for its intervention in industry, lack of tax cuts and increased spending commitments on public services. On Brexit it committed to leaving the single market and customs union while seeking a &quot;deep and special partnership&quot; and promised a vote in parliament on the final agreement.

The manifesto also proposed reforms to social care in England that would raise the threshold for free care from £23,250 to £100,000 while including property in the means test and permitting deferred payment after death. After attracting substantial media attention, four days after the manifesto launch May stated that the proposed social care reforms would now include an &quot;absolute limit&quot; on costs in contrast to the rejection of a cap in the manifesto. She criticised the &quot;fake&quot; portrayal of the policy in recent days by Labour and other critics who had termed it a &quot;dementia tax&quot;. &quot;Evening Standard&quot; editor George Osborne called the policy change a &quot;U-turn&quot;. &quot;The Financial Times&quot; contrasted her &quot;Strong and Stable&quot; leadership slogan with her own record of nine rapid U-turns claiming she was &quot;making a habit of retreating from policies.&quot;

The general election in June resulted in a hung parliament, prompting her to broker a deal with Northern Ireland&#x27;s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), involving £1 billion of additional public funding for Northern Ireland.

=== Second term (2017–2019) ===
Less than two weeks after the 2017 State Opening of Parliament, May ordered a full public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal. For this she was widely praised as successive governments going back to the 1980s had refused such an inquiry, some though speculated that May had simply been forced to announce the inquiry after a group legal action and news of fresh evidence were brought by Jason Evans. Additionally, Andy Burnham had threatened to take evidence to the police if an inquiry were not announced. With over 1,000 core participants, the Infected Blood Inquiry is the biggest public inquiry ever held in the UK.

==== Myanmar ====
May is the first British prime minister to visit Buenos Aires after the Falklands War. In November 2017, May said the actions of Myanmar Army and police against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar &quot;looks like ethnic cleansing&quot;. According to May, &quot;it is something for which the Burmese authorities – and especially the military – must take full responsibility.&quot; From the 2017 general election to December 2017, May suffered no defeats in whipped votes in the House of Commons. On 13 December 2017, May lost a vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill by 309 votes to 305, due to 11 Conservatives voting against the government, including Stephen Hammond who was then vice-chairman of the Conservative Party.

==== Russia ====

May accused Russia of &quot;threatening the international order&quot;, &quot;seeking to weaponise information&quot; and &quot;deploying its state-run media organisations to plant fake stories&quot;. She further suggested the country had been meddling in the 2017 German federal election in contradiction of German government officials and security experts, who had dismissed the possibility.

May&#x27;s government accused Russia for orchestrating the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The UK&#x27;s official assessment of this incident was supported by 28 other countries, who expelled an unprecedented total of 153 Russian diplomats. May said in the House of Commons on 12 March:

==== China ====
May promised to confront China on human rights but was praised in Communist Party-controlled media for &quot;sidestepping&quot; human rights in China during her first official visit to the country. The &quot;Global Times&quot; said: &quot;For the Prime Minister, the losses outweigh the gains if she appeases the British media at the cost of the visit&#x27;s friendly atmosphere.&quot;

==== Assassination plot ====
In 2017, Islamic State terrorist Naa&#x27;imur Zakariyah Rahman was foiled in a plot to assassinate May at Downing Street.

==== Turkey ====
In May 2018, during a three-day state visit to the UK by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, May declared that Britain is a &quot;true friend&quot; of Turkey, but she added that &quot;It is important that in defence of democracy, which has been facing extraordinary pressures from the failed coup, instability across the border from Syria and from Kurdish terrorism, Turkey does not lose sight of the values it is seeking to defend.&quot;

====Contempt of Parliament====
On 4 December 2018, on a motion passed by MPs by 311 to 293 votes, the May Government was found in contempt of Parliament; the first government to be found in contempt in history. The vote was triggered by the government failing to lay before Parliament any legal advice on the proposed withdrawal agreement on the terms of the UK&#x27;s departure from the European Union, after a humble address for a return was unanimously agreed to by the House of Commons on 13 November 2018. The government then agreed to publish the full legal advice for Brexit that was given to the Prime Minister by the Attorney General during negotiations with the European Union.

====Vote of confidence (Conservative Party)====
In December 2018, May faced a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party over opposition to her negotiated Brexit deal, after the number of Conservative MPs exceeded the 48 no-confidence letter threshold that the 1922 Committee Chairman, Sir Graham Brady required for the vote of confidence to be held. May won the vote with 200 Conservative MPs voting for her, compared to 117 voting against. As part of her speech to the Parliamentary Conservative Party before the confidence vote was opened, it was reported that May conceded that she would step down as prime minister after delivering Brexit and would not lead the Conservative Party into the next General Election in exchange for Conservative MPs voting to have confidence in her leadership so that she would be able to keep the party, Parliament and the UK stable during the final stages of Brexit. May later confirmed this to BBC News Political editor, Laura Kuenssberg after meeting EU leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels.

====Vote of no confidence (House of Commons)====

On 17 December 2018 in the House of Commons, the Leader of the Opposition and Labour Party Leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tabled a motion of no confidence in May&#x27;s premiership, citing May&#x27;s refusal to set the date for the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal before Christmas, and instead pushing it back to mid-January. The following day the government refused to allow time for the motion to be debated. John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, confirmed that they were under no obligation to do so. Following the defeat of May&#x27;s Brexit deal on 15 January 2019, Corbyn tabled a motion of no confidence in the Government, to be voted on by parliament the following evening. The motion was defeated by 325 votes to 306; a majority of 19.

====Brexit deal defeats====

In January 2019, May&#x27;s government was defeated in the House of Commons by a margin of 230 votes (202 in favour and 432 opposed) in a vote on her deal to leave the European Union (&quot;first meaningful vote&quot;). It was the largest majority against a United Kingdom government in history.

In March, May was again defeated in the Commons by 149 votes (242 in favour and 391 against) on her latest deal after she secured last-minute concessions from the EU (&quot;second meaningful vote&quot;). May was then again defeated by 58 votes in the Commons (286 in favour and 344 against) on the withdrawal deal but not the political declaration (&quot;third meaningful vote&quot;).

====Resignation====


On 27 March 2019 at a meeting of the 1922 Committee, May confirmed that she will &quot;not lead the UK in the next stage of Brexit negotiations&quot;, meaning she was expected to resign after the third meaningful vote, if it had passed successfully. However, no date was stated, and her reported wording was ambiguous and thus carried no binding force. On 29 March, the third meaningful vote was defeated, and while May did not state anything in regards to standing down, Corbyn stated that if May could not find an alternative to her deal &quot;she must go, not at an indeterminate date in the future but now.&quot;

On 22 April it was announced that the leaders of 70 Conservative Associations had signed a petition calling for a vote of no confidence. Under party rules an Extraordinary General Meeting must be convened if one is demanded by 65 associations. The non-binding vote, to be determined by 800 of the party&#x27;s senior officials, would be the first time such an instance has occurred. On 24 April, the party&#x27;s 1922 Committee ruled out changing the leadership challenge rules, but its chair, Graham Brady, asked for clarity on when May would step down from office.

On 24 May she confirmed that she would resign as Conservative Party leader on 7 June, stating, &quot;it is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort.&quot; She continued to serve as prime minister until she tendered her resignation to the Queen on 24 July. This coincided with the arrival of Boris Johnson as prime minister, who was elected by the Conservative Party membership. By constitutional convention May did not step down until she assured the Queen that Johnson would be able to command the confidence of the House of Commons.

In one of May&#x27;s last Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, Barry Sheerman, the Labour MP for Huddersfield, urged May not to &quot;cut and run&quot; and instead reconsider her resignation. May responded by saying she would return to the role of a backbench MP after leaving office.

On 24 July 2019, May ended her consecutive service at the frontbench since 1998 when she had been appointed Shadow Spokesman for Schools, Disabled People and Women. Mick Davis, who was the Chairman of the British Conservative Party which selected her premiership, exited that post along with May.

===Ministerial resignations===

May&#x27;s premiership had 51 resignations with 33 relating to Brexit. These included 12 departures from the Cabinet. The pace and number of resignations have been described as &#x27;unprecedented&#x27; by the Institute for Government, with resignations impacting the functioning of the government. In less than three years, May received more resignations than Thatcher (11 years) or Blair (10 years). The Chief Whip Julian Smith described May&#x27;s Cabinet as exhibiting the &#x27;worst cabinet ill-discipline in history&#x27;.

=== Public opinion ===
May had a high approval rating during her first week as prime minister. The results of an Ipsos MORI survey released in July 2016 indicated that 55% of those surveyed believed that May was a suitable PM while only 23% believed that the Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn would make a good prime minister.

A &quot;ComRes&quot; poll taken in September 2016 after her election suggested May was seen as substantially more &quot;in touch with ordinary British people&quot; than her predecessor David Cameron and a majority of voters saw her as &quot;the right person to unite the country&quot;.

At the beginning of 2017, nearly six months after becoming prime minister, a ComRes found May was the most popular UK politician with a net rating of +9 which was described as the longest honeymoon period enjoyed by any sitting Conservative prime minister since the end of the Second World War.

The Conservative Party had a 21-point lead over Labour in a poll released the day before May announced a snap election but this lead narrowed substantially. In mid-June, following the election, a YouGov poll showed that May&#x27;s popularity had dropped to a rating of −34. In April 2018, May had a higher approval rating than Corbyn for the first time since the general election, leading him by −13 to −23.

Plans to reform social care came to dominate the Conservative election campaign during the 2017 snap election, with some arguing it ultimately cost May her majority. May&#x27;s promised green paper on the future of adult social care was plagued by frequent delays, ultimately never materialising during her premiership. A December 2019 poll by learning disabilities charity Hft found that 59% of social care providers in England believed that the situation in social care worsened under May&#x27;s premiership, compared to just 3% who said it was slightly better.

==Political positions==

May has identified herself with the one-nation conservative position within her party.

Since coming into prominence as a front-bench politician, May&#x27;s public image has divided media opinion, especially from some in the traditionalist right-wing press. Commenting on May&#x27;s debut as Home Secretary, Anne Perkins of &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed that &quot;she&#x27;ll be nobody&#x27;s stooge&quot;, while Cristina Odone of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; predicted her to be &quot;the rising star&quot; of the Coalition Government. Allegra Stratton, then with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, praised May as showing managerial acumen.

Describing her as a liberal Conservative, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; characterised May as a &quot;non-ideological politician with a ruthless streak who gets on with the job&quot;, in doing so comparing her to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Conversely, in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Rebecca Glover of the Policy Innovation Research Unit contrasted May to Boris Johnson, claiming that she was &quot;staunchly more conservative, more anti-immigration, and more isolationist&quot; than he was.

During her leadership campaign, May said that &quot;We need an economy that works for everyone&quot;, pledging to crack down on executive pay by making shareholders&#x27; votes binding rather than advisory and to put workers onto company boards (although she later claimed that the last pledge was not to be mandatory), policies that &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes as going further than the Labour Party&#x27;s 2015 general election manifesto.

After she became prime minister, May&#x27;s first speech espoused the left, with a promise to combat the &quot;burning injustice&quot; in British society and to create a union &quot;between all of our citizens&quot; and promising to be an advocate for the &quot;ordinary working-class family&quot; and not for the affluent in the UK. &quot;The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives ... When we take the big calls, we&#x27;ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws we&#x27;ll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes we&#x27;ll prioritise not the wealthy but you.&quot;

May has described herself as a personal supporter of fox hunting with hounds, saying that foxes&#x27; numbers had to be controlled and that hunting them with dogs was the most humane way to do it. The Conservative manifesto for the 2017 election included a pledge to hold a parliamentary vote to repeal the Hunting Act 2004, which prohibits a range of hunting activities.

After the Conservatives&#x27; manifesto for the 2017 election was released, some people, including Fraser Nelson of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, called her a &quot;red Tory&quot;, saying that she had moved her party to the left in politics. &quot;Politico&quot; called her policies &quot;Mayism&quot;, saying that Mayism was &quot;a working-class conservatism openly critical of the &quot;cult of individualism&quot; and globalization&quot;.

May praised the former prime minister Winston Churchill and has a portrait of Churchill on the wall of her study. May&#x27;s spokesman said: &quot;The prime minister has quoted and referenced Sir Winston Churchill on many occasion and acknowledged him as one of the great prime ministers of the 20th century.&quot;

May welcomed the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, saying that &quot;no one is above the law.&quot; Assange had fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012 after being accused of sexual assault in Sweden. He is also wanted by the US for &quot;conspiracy to commit computer intrusion&quot; relating to the Wikileaks release of classified material in 2010, including footage of US soldiers killing civilians in Iraq.

===Foreign policy===
In 2003, May voted to approve the invasion of Iraq and in 2013 voted in favour of British military intervention in the Syrian civil war.

The May Ministry delayed the final approval for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in July 2016, a project which May had objected to when she was Home Secretary. Her political adviser Nick Timothy wrote an article in 2015 to oppose People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s involvement in sensitive sectors. He said that the government was &quot;selling our national security to China&quot; without rational concerns and &quot;the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies.&quot;

Politicians and human rights activists urged Theresa May&#x27;s government to vote against Saudi Arabian retention of the membership of the UN Human Rights Council. Amnesty International&#x27;s UK Foreign Policy Programme Director Polly Truscott said: &quot;Rather than turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s continuing bully tactics, the UK should publicly hold the Saudi authorities to account for its appalling human rights record and the ongoing war crimes in Yemen and should stop selling weapons to Saudi as a matter of urgency.&quot; May defended selling arms to Saudi Arabia stating that close ties with the country &quot;keep people on the streets of Britain safe&quot;.

===Economic policy===
Prior to her premiership, May outlined plans to backtrack on the longstanding government plan to achieve a surplus by 2020, following the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union. With uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has suggested that the government&#x27;s Autumn Statement may be used to &quot;reset&quot; economic policy.

In 2015, while May was Home Secretary, an 18% funding cut in the police force had taken place with the loss of around 20,000 police officers. Before the Manchester Arena bombing and after the Paris attacks, she was warned by a Manchester senior police officer that the cuts in the force and community policing risked terror attacks in the city due to the lack of resources to undertake proper intelligence and anti-terrorist measures.

In May and Hammond&#x27;s 2017 budget, continued government policies were confirmed regarding freezing benefits.

May&#x27;s government published a Green Paper in November 2016 which considered forcing companies to reveal the difference between what their CEOs are paid and what their ordinary workers are paid. On 1 January 2019 new regulations came into force for UK listed companies with over 250 employees to annually disclose the ratio of their CEO&#x27;s pay to the median, lower quartile, and upper quartile pay of their UK employees.

===Workers&#x27; representatives===
Before her premiership began, May said that she planned to have workers represented on company boards, saying &quot;If I&#x27;m prime minister ... we&#x27;re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well.&quot; May aimed to put workers&#x27; and consumers&#x27; representatives on boards to make them more accountable. Nils Pratley, a journalist at &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote in July &quot;Fundamental principles of Britain&#x27;s boardroom governance are being rethought. It is a very welcome development. In the more enlightened quarters of the UK corporate world, they can see that boardroom pay has eroded trust in business.&quot; Workers&#x27; representatives, it appeared, would have made UK companies more like those in Germany and France. May was accused of backtracking in November 2016 when she said that firms would not be forced to adopt the proposal, saying &quot;there are a number of ways in which that can be achieved&quot;.

===Environmental policy===
Following the impact of &quot;Blue Planet II&quot; in 2017, the May administration outlined plans to approve further green policy. A particular focus has been on plastic and its impact on the environment. Her government&#x27;s &quot;25 Year Environment Plan&quot; was published in January 2018: targets were set for achievement of a number of environmental benefits with dates ranging from 2025 to 2060. In March 2018, May announced plans for a plastic deposit scheme modelled on a similar policy in Norway to boost recycling.

===EU and Brexit===

May publicly stated her support for the UK remaining in the EU during the 2016 referendum campaign, but did not campaign extensively in the referendum and criticised aspects of the EU in a speech. It was speculated by political journalists that May had sought to minimise her involvement in the debate to strengthen her position as a future candidate for the Conservative party leadership. Some in David Cameron&#x27;s ministry likened May to a &quot;submarine&quot; on the issue of Brexit due to her perceived indifference towards the referendum and the EU.

In a leaked recording prior to the Brexit referendum, May stated:
May also said Britain was more secure as part of the EU due to the European arrest warrant and Europe-wide information sharing among other factors. She said, &quot;There are definitely things we can do as members of the European Union that I think keep us more safe&quot;.

May&#x27;s public reticence during the referendum campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled that she would support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later went on to say before the 2017 United Kingdom general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that &quot;no deal is better than a bad deal. We have to be prepared to walk out&quot;. The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was &quot;disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market.&quot; Phil Wilson for the Open Britain group said, &quot;It&#x27;s good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government&#x27;s negotiating position.&quot;
On 22 September 2017, May officially made public the details of her Brexit proposal during a speech in Florence, urging the European Union to maintain a transitional period of two years after Brexit during which trade terms remain unaltered. During this period, the UK would also continue to honour its budget commitments of about €10 billion per annum, and accept immigration from Europe. Her speech was criticised by leading Eurosceptic Nigel Farage. The European Union&#x27;s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed May&#x27;s proposal as &quot;constructive,&quot; but said it also &quot;must be translated into negotiating positions to make meaningful progress.&quot;

May did not initially wish to give MPs a vote on withdrawal from the European Union. Nicky Morgan stated &quot;in 2016 MPs aren&#x27;t asking for a veto but they do want a say and we hope the Prime Minister will remember her earlier words&quot;. Anna Soubry and Nick Clegg also called for more parliamentary involvement. In November 2016, the High Court ruled in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union that parliament must vote on the decision to leave the EU but May appealed to the Supreme Court. Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish First Minister has joined the case as did representatives from Wales and Northern Ireland. Sturgeon felt that the Scottish Parliament should also consent to the UK triggering of Article 50. She said she was not seeking to prevent England and Wales leaving but wanted to preserve Scotland&#x27;s place in the EU. In the end the Supreme Court required a vote in the UK parliament.

May was accused of not having a plan if Brexit talks broke down. There were fears that if talks failed Britain could be left trading under WTO rules which it was feared by some analysts would seriously damage jobs and livelihoods in Britain and Europe. May&#x27;s ministers repeatedly promised to walk away from a bad final deal but, it was argued by some commentators, had no plans for how to manage without a deal. Ivan Rogers described May&#x27;s Brexit strategy as &quot;an accident waiting to happen&quot;. He said completing Brexit was &quot;guaranteed&quot; to take a decade and alleged May&#x27;s hopes of a trade deal made to order meant that instability in the next few months was &quot;quite likely&quot;.

In late October 2018, the National Audit Office claimed that it was already too late to prepare the necessary Irish border security checks in the event of a No-deal scenario—a weakness that could be exploited by criminals.

On 5 February 2019, May gave a speech to business leaders in Belfast to address Brexit stating the United Kingdom&#x27;s relationship with Ireland was closer than the 26 other members of the EU. She affirmed the government&#x27;s &quot;absolute&quot; commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and stated that Britain would seek to have no hard border in Northern Ireland.

It was reported in 2020 that former MI6 operative Christopher Steele accused May, while Boris Johnson was foreign secretary, of ignoring claims that Russia may have secretly funded Brexit. Steele accuses May&#x27;s government of selling British interests short by not taking matters further: &quot;In this case, political considerations seemed to outweigh national security interests. If so, in my view, HMG made a serious mistake in balancing matters of strategic importance to our country.&quot;

In July 2020 the Intelligence and Security Committee report on Russia was released. It stated that the British government and intelligence agencies failed to conduct any assessment of Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum. It stated the government &quot;had not seen or sought evidence of successful interference in UK democratic processes&quot;. Stewart Hosie, SNP member said &quot;The report reveals that no one in government knew if Russia interfered in or sought to influence the referendum because they did not want to know&quot;. However, the report stated no firm conclusion could be ascertained on whether the Kremlin had or had not successfully interfered in the referendum.

===Feminism===
In 2005, May co-founded the mentoring and pressure group Women2Win. This group and May&#x27;s personal efforts have been credited with increasing the number of Conservative women MPs and with supporting them. In government she lobbied for improvements to maternity leave, and as Home Secretary she acted on FGM and introduced a law on coercive control. However, she has been criticised for the financial cuts made by her government, which have been claimed to have had the greatest impact on poor and vulnerable women.

===Same-sex relationships===
In 1998, May voted against lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts. May was also a supporter of Section 28, calling a failed repeal in 2000 to be &quot;a victory for commonsense&quot;. She was absent for the vote when it was successfully repealed in 2003. She also voted against the Adoption and Children Act 2002 that allowed same-sex couples to adopt.

Beginning in 2012, however, May expressed support for the introduction of same-sex marriage by recording a video for the Out4Marriage campaign, in which she stated &quot;I believe if two people care for each other, if they love each other, if they want to commit to each other... then they should be able to get married and marriage should be for everyone&quot;. In May 2013, May voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, which legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales. In 2017, May apologised for her past votes while taking credit for helping advance LGBT rights within her party.

==Post-premiership (2019–present)==

After leaving 10 Downing Street, May took her place on the backbenches, remaining an MP to &quot;devote her full time&quot; to her constituency of Maidenhead, Berkshire. In the 2019 general election she was re-elected as the constituency&#x27;s MP.

In May 2020, May criticised Dominic Cummings when he broke lockdown rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. She abstained in the vote on the second lockdown in Parliament.

On 13 July 2021, May was one of 24 Conservative MPs who voted against their party, defying the whip for the first time in 24 years, over the government&#x27;s proposal to cut its foreign aid budget. She criticised the government, saying in an address to Parliament, &quot;We made a promise to the poorest people in the world. The Government have broken that promise.&quot;

Amid the Partygate scandal, May was critical of Boris Johnson after the publication of the summary of the Sue Gray report, stating &quot;either my right honourable friend had not read the rules or didn&#x27;t understand what they meant and others around him, or they didn&#x27;t think the rules applied to Number 10. Which was it?&quot;

On 16 March 2022, Russia banned May from visiting the country over its invasion of Ukraine.

In September 2023, the House of Commons official portrait of May by artist Saied Dai was unveiled. In a radio interview with Nick Robinson she said that her Brexit deal would have been better and that she regretted saying &quot;nothing has changed&quot;. Also in that month, May&#x27;s book titled &quot;The Abuse of Power - Confronting Injustice in Public Life&quot; was published. In October 2023, May appeared as the guest star in 2 episodes of The Rest Is Politics: Leading, hosted by Alastair Campbell, and a former minister in her government, Rory Stewart.

In March 2023, May was reselected as the Conservative candidate for Maidenhead at the 2024 general election, however in March 2024, May announced that she would not seek re-election as an MP at the general election, joining a record number of Conservative MPs standing down at the election. May said she is spending much of her time on causes &quot;close to my heart&quot;: &quot;These causes have been taking an increasing amount of my time. Because of this, after much careful thought and consideration, I have realised that, looking ahead, I would no longer be able to do my job as an MP in the way I believe is right and my constituents deserve.&quot; Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called May a &quot;relentless campaigner&quot; who had been &quot;fiercely loyal&quot; to Maidenhead, and added that she &quot;defines what it means to be a public servant&quot;. Her predecessor David Cameron called her &quot;a brilliant public servant&quot; who could &quot;hold her head high&quot;, and said she had done much to &quot;modernise the Conservative Party and promote women in public life&quot;. Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer thanked May for her service, saying that she had &quot;served this House and her constituents with a real sense of duty&quot; and added that her &quot;unwavering commitment to ending modern slavery is commended by all of us.&quot; She was succeeded as MP for Maidenhead by Liberal Democrat Joshua Reynolds, the first liberal MP to be elected to represent this constituency in over 100 years.

May has been mentioned as a possible candidate to replace NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg following his retirement. In June 2021, British Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace expressed support for a potential May candidacy, saying &quot;she would be an excellent candidate.&quot;

===Peerage===
May was nominated for a life peerage in Rishi Sunak&#x27;s 2024 Dissolution Honours. She was created &quot;Baroness May of Maidenhead, of Sonning in the Royal County of Berkshire&quot;, on 21 August 2024 and introduced to the House of Lords on 12 September 2024.

==Personal life==
May has been married to Sir Philip May, an investment relationship manager, since 6 September 1980. It has been reported that former prime minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto introduced the two during their time at Oxford. May credits future Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull for encouraging Philip to propose to her. May has expressed regret that she and her husband did not have children. The Mays are passionate walkers, and they regularly spend their holidays hiking in the Swiss Alps. May is also a cricket fan, stating that Sir Geoffrey Boycott was one of her sporting heroes. She also enjoys cooking, and has said that she owns 100 cookery books. Philip has said that she &quot;is a very good cook&quot;.

May and her husband reside in the Thames village of Sonning which is within her former constituency. She is the first cousin once removed of the Labour MP Alistair Strathern.

May is a member of the Church of England and regularly worships at church (usually at St Andrew&#x27;s, Sonning) on Sundays. The daughter of an Anglican priest, Hubert Brasier, May has said that her Christian faith &quot;is part of me. It is part of who I am and therefore how I approach things&quot;. She was raised in the Anglo-Catholic or High Church tradition of Anglicanism, of which her Mirfield-trained father was a proponent.

May is known for a love of fashion, and in particular of distinctive shoes; she wore leopard-print shoes at her &#x27;Nasty Party&#x27; speech in 2002, as well as her final Cabinet meeting as Home Secretary in 2016. On &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 2014, she chose a subscription to &quot;Vogue&quot; as her luxury item. However, she has been critical of the media focusing on her fashion instead of her achievements as a politician.

May was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1 in November 2012. She is treated with daily insulin injections.

She was nominated as one of the Society&#x27;s Inspiring Women of 2006. In February 2013, BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; described her as Britain&#x27;s second-most powerful woman after Queen Elizabeth II; May was Home Secretary at the time, and the most senior woman in that government.

In 2001 she was made a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Marketors.

In September 2017, she was listed by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the second most powerful woman in the world, behind Angela Merkel.

<text>The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad , commonly known as The Consolidated, or simply as the New Haven, was a railroad that operated principally in the New England region of the United States from 1872 to 1968. Founded by the merger of the New York and New Haven and Hartford and New Haven railroads, the company had near-total dominance of railroad traffic in Southern New England for the first half of the 20th century.

Beginning in the 1890s and accelerating in 1903, New York banker J. P. Morgan sought to monopolize New England transportation by arranging the NH&#x27;s acquisition of 50 companies, including other railroads and steamship lines, and building a network of electrified trolley lines that provided interurban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated more than of track, with 120,000 employees, and practically monopolized traffic in a wide swath from Boston to New York City.

This quest for monopoly angered Progressive Era reformers, alienated public opinion, raised the cost of acquiring other companies and increased the railroad&#x27;s construction costs. The company&#x27;s debt soared from $14 million in 1903 to $242 million in 1913, while the advent of automobiles, trucks and buses reduced its profits. Also in 1913, the federal government filed an antitrust lawsuit that forced the NH to divest its trolley systems.

The line became bankrupt in 1935. It emerged from bankruptcy, albeit reduced in scope, in 1947, only to go bankrupt again in 1961. In 1969, its rail assets were merged with the Penn Central system, formed a year earlier by the merger of the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad. Already a poorly conceived merger, Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970, becoming the largest U.S. bankruptcy until the Enron Corporation superseded it in 2001. The remnants of the system now comprise Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s New Haven Line, much of the northern leg of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, Connecticut&#x27;s Shore Line East and Hartford Line, parts of the MBTA, and numerous freight operators such as CSX and the Providence and Worcester Railroad. The majority of the surviving system is now owned publicly by the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, with other surviving segments owned by freight railroads; many abandoned lines have been converted into rail trails.

==History==

=== Predecessors and formation (1839–1872) ===

The New Haven system was formed by the merger of two railroads that intersected in New Haven, Connecticut: the Hartford and New Haven Railroad, which began service between New Haven and Hartford in 1839 and reached Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1844, and the New York and New Haven Railroad, which opened in 1848 between its namesake cities. The two companies had a history of cooperation; for a time, they jointly leased the New Haven and Northampton Railroad and coordinated their steamship services with each other.

An initial merger attempt between the two in 1870 was rejected by the Connecticut General Assembly, largely over fears that the merged railroad would form a monopoly. But the legislature approved a second attempt just two years later, and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad was formed on July 24, 1872. The newly combined railroad owned a main line from New York City to Springfield via New Haven and Hartford, and also reached New London, Connecticut via a lease of the Shore Line Railway (leased in 1870 by the New York and New Haven Railroad).

=== Expansion and acquisitions (1872–1900) ===
The company later leased more lines and systems, eventually forming a virtual monopoly in New England south of the Boston and Albany Railroad. In 1882, the railroad leased the Boston, New York and Airline Railroad, the last railroad in New Haven not controlled by the NYNH&amp;H. This new acquisition gave the New Haven Railroad a connection to Willimantic, Connecticut. Two more companies, the Naugatuck Railroad and the Connecticut Valley Railroad, were leased by the New Haven in 1887. With these two leases, the New Haven was in control of 10 of the 22 railroads in Connecticut at the time.

=== Early 20th century (1900–1935) ===

Around the beginning of the 20th century, New York investors led by J. P. Morgan gained control, and in 1903 installed Charles S. Mellen as President. Charles Francis Murphy&#x27;s New York Contracting and Trucking company was awarded a $6 million contract in 1904 to build rail lines in the Bronx for the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. An executive at the railroad said the contract was awarded to avoid friction with New York City’s Tammany Hall political machine. In response to this contract, the New York State Legislature amended the city&#x27;s charter so that franchise-awarding power was removed from the city council and given to the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, which only became defunct in 1989. Morgan and Mellen achieved a complete monopoly of transportation in southern New England, purchasing other railroads and steamship and trolley lines. More than 100 independent railroads eventually became part of the system before and during these years, reaching 2,131 miles at its 1929 peak. Substantial improvements to the system were made during the Mellen years, including electrification between New York and New Haven. Morgan and Mellen went further and attempted to acquire or neutralize competition from other railroads in New England, including the New York Central&#x27;s Boston and Albany Railroad, the Rutland Railroad, the Maine Central Railroad, and the Boston and Maine Railroad. But the Morgan-Mellen expansion left the company overextended and financially weak.

In 1914, 21 directors and ex-directors of the railroad were indicted for &quot;conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce by acquiring the control of practically all the transportation facilities of New England.&quot;
In 1925, the railroad created the New England Transportation Company as a subsidiary to operate buses and trucks on routes where rail service was no longer profitable.

=== Financial difficulties (1935–1969) ===

Under the stress of the Great Depression the company became bankrupt in 1935, remaining in trusteeship until 1947. Common stock was voided and creditors assumed control. During the 88 stations case, the railroad closed 88 stations in Massachusetts and 5 in Rhode Island in 1938, and unsuccessfully attempted to abandon the Boston-area portion of the Old Colony Division. The twelve-year reorganization resulted in &quot;eight Supreme Court decisions, fourteen circuit court decisions, five district court decisions, and eleven ICC reports.&quot; The railroad emerged in September 1947 under a reorganization plan approved in federal court, without the vast majority of its previous non-railroad interests, and with a number of unprofitable passenger operations on marginal branches replaced with bus service.

In 1948, the company operated 644 locomotives, 1,602 passenger cars and 8,796 freight cars on 1,581 miles of track. After 1951, both freight and passenger service lost money. The earlier expansion had left NH with a network of low-density branch lines that could not pay their own maintenance and operating costs. The freight business was short-haul, requiring switching costs that could not be recovered in short-distance rates. They operated major commuter train services in New York and Boston (as well as New Haven, Hartford and Providence), but these had always lost money; though heavily patronized, these services operated only during the morning and evening rush hours, and were unable to recover their infrastructure costs. The demise of the New Haven was likely hastened by the 1958 opening of the Connecticut Turnpike, largely paralleling the railroad’s mainline across the state, and the subsequent construction of other interstate highways. With decades of inadequate investment, the New Haven could not compete against automobiles or trucks.In 1954, the brash Patrick B. McGinnis led a proxy fight against incumbent president Frederic C. &quot;Buck&quot; Dumaine Jr., vowing to return more of the company&#x27;s profit to shareholders. McGinnis won control of the railroad and appointed Arthur V. McGowan, a longtime acquaintance, Vice President. McGinnis attempted to accomplish many of his financial goals by deferring all but the most essential maintenance. Under McGinnis, Knoll Associates was retained to design a new visual identity for the company. Green and gold trim on rolling stock was replaced by black, red-orange and white, accompanied by a stylized &quot;NH&quot; emblem. Knoll employed architect Marcel Breuer to design the interiors and exterior styling of the three experimental trainsets – the &quot;Dan&#x27;l Webster&quot;, &quot;John Quincy Adams&quot;, and &quot;Roger Williams&quot; – that were ordered in 1955. Breuer also designed new station buildings for Rye and New London, neither of which were built, as well as the interior of a never-built design for articulated commuter coaches. When McGinnis departed in 1956, he left the company financially wrecked, a situation exacerbated by severe damage from the 1955 Connecticut floods.

In 1959, the New Haven discontinued passenger service on the Old Colony Railroad network in southeastern Massachusetts. That year, the company reported close to $11 million in losses. Asked by the Connecticut Public Utilities Commission in February 1960 if the company&#x27;s survival was in imminent danger, the New Haven&#x27;s comptroller replied, &quot;Yes, even with the best of management&quot;. Continuing financial problems forced the New Haven into bankruptcy on July 7, 1961, and federal court judge Robert P. Anderson assumed trusteeship. The railroad reported it would have only $9,262,000 in funds to cover expenses of $33,480,000 at the year&#x27;s end. Company president George Alpert blamed &quot;government subsidies direct and indirect to our competitors, and inequitable taxes&quot; for the railroad&#x27;s deficits, pointing to billions of dollars in federal funding for highways and airports.

===Merger with Penn Central (1969–1976)===

At the insistence of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the New Haven was merged into Penn Central on December 31, 1968, ending rail operations by the corporation. Penn Central was bankrupt by 1970 and the New Haven corporate entity remained in existence throughout the 1970s as the Trustee of the Estate pursued just payment from Penn Central for the New Haven&#x27;s assets. Leased by the New Haven since before 1900, the Providence and Worcester Railroad (P&amp;W) successfully exited its lease under Penn Central and resumed operating its own line in 1973.

A substantial portion of the former New Haven main line between New York and Boston was transferred to Amtrak in 1976 and now forms the northern leg of the electrified Northeast Corridor, hosting high-speed &quot;Acela Express&quot; and regional rail service. The main line between New Rochelle and New Haven is jointly owned by the state of Connecticut and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York, and is served by the Metro-North Railroad’s New Haven Line and Shore Line East, providing commuter service from Manhattan’s Grand Central Terminal as far eastward as New London, Connecticut. The New Haven Line is coded red on Metro-North timetables and system maps, a nod to the red livery used by the New Haven for the last decade of its history. MBTA&#x27;s Providence/Stoughton Line provides commuter service between Providence and South Station in Boston.

Amtrak took over passenger service on the New Haven–Springfield Line in 1976, and was joined by the state of Connecticut&#x27;s Hartford Line in 2018.

On August 28, 1980, American Financial Enterprises, Inc., acquired the remaining assets of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company when the plan for reorganization was approved by the court and the company was reorganized. This brought to an end the 108-year corporate history of the storied railroad, and the end to the 19-year saga of its second bankruptcy reorganization. American Financial Enterprises would become the largest single stockholder of Penn Central Company shares by the mid-1990s, controlling 32% of the stock of the company.

===The Conrail era and beyond (1976–present)===

Freight operations on former New Haven lines passed to Conrail with its government-overseen creation on April 1, 1976. During the subsequent 23 years, Conrail withdrew from much of that territory, abandoning some track and handing other lines over to the Providence &amp; Worcester, Bay Colony, Boston &amp; Maine, Connecticut Central, Pioneer Valley, Housatonic and Connecticut Southern railroads. Those lines still operated by Conrail in 1999 became part of CSX Transportation as the result of the breakup of the Conrail system.
The state of Connecticut frequently alludes to the New Haven in its modern transportation projects; much of the state’s commuter equipment is painted in McGinnis-era livery, while the iconic &quot;NH&quot; logo appears on everything from rolling stock, station signage, to tourism materials for the city of New Haven itself.

The Connecticut Department of Transportation has painted its diesel commuter rail locomotives used on the non-electrified Danbury and Waterbury Metro-North branches, as well as its Shore Line East operation, in the &quot;McGinnis Scheme,&quot; composed of white, black, and orange-red stripes with the iconic NH logo. Although a new livery was introduced with the opening of the Hartford Line commuter service in 2018, much of its equipment is shared with Shore Line East, of which some continue to bear the McGinnis livery and the rest have been repainted into the new &quot;CT Rail&quot; livery. All of these lines were formerly owned by the New Haven.

The Valley Railroad, a preservation line based in Essex, Connecticut that runs both steam and diesel traction, has painted the authentic script-lettering insignia of the original &quot;New York, New Haven and Hartford&quot; railroad on the tenders of its resident steam locomotives, 2-8-0 Consolidation type Number 97 and 2-8-2 Mikado type number 40. There is a third steam locomotive in restoration to running order; a Chinese SY-class Mikado, formerly known as the 1658, it is being renumbered and painted as New Haven 3025, and is to be based on a Mikado-type engine that was typical to the New Haven.

The name of the Hartford Yard Goats Minor League Baseball team reflects the old New York, New Haven and Hartford railroad history and the design of its logo is based on the original NYNHH logo. The team plays in downtown Hartford at Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Park, which is adjacent to Hartford Yard, originally built by NYNHH.

==Operations==
===Passenger===

* Passenger trains ran between Grand Central Terminal and Boston&#x27;s South Station via Providence, Springfield or Willimantic.
* Several passenger trains a day, including the overnight &quot;Federal&quot;, ran between Washington, D.C. and New York (Penn Station) via PRR and on to Boston.
* Passenger service operated from Grand Central Terminal to Hartford, Springfield and beyond.
* The premier New York–Boston passenger service was the &quot;Merchants Limited&quot;, leaving Grand Central and South Station simultaneously at 5 PM. Also prominent was the &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot;, with 1 PM departures. For many years these trains carried no coaches, only parlor cars, dining and lounge cars.

NH introduced ideas for passenger rail travel, including early use of restaurant and parlor cars in the steam era, and more during the transition to diesel. NH was a pioneer in many ways; in streamliners with the Comet, in the use of diesel multiple units (DMUs) in the U.S. with both Budd&#x27;s regular Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) and the all-RDC &quot;Roger Williams&quot; trainset, in the use of rail-adapted buses, in lightweight trains such as the Train X-equipped &quot;Dan&#x27;l Webster&quot;, and in experimentation with Talgo-type (passive tilt) equipment on the train &quot;John Quincy Adams&quot;.

An audacious experiment was the UAC TurboTrain, which with passive tilt, turbine engines and light weight attempted to revolutionize medium—distance railway travel in the U.S. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Turbo Train holds the U.S. railway speed record of 170 mph, set in 1968. The NH never operated the Turbo in revenue service, as the NH was purchased by PC, which operated the train.

*Commuter service from Boston went to destinations on the OC system of Greenbush, Plymouth, Brockton/Campello, Middleboro, Hyannis/Woods Hole on Cape Cod, Fall River, Newport, New Bedford and Providence, Woonsocket, Needham Heights, West Medway and Dedham.

====Yale Bowl trains====
Beginning November 21, 1914, the railroad operated special trains to bring football fans to and from the new Yale Bowl stadium in New Haven. Passengers rode extra trains from Springfield, Boston, and especially New York to the New Haven Union Station, where they transferred to trolleys for the ride to the Bowl. On November 21, 1922, for example, such trains carried more than 50,000 passengers. &quot;There is nothing which can be compared with the New Haven&#x27;s football movement except a record of one of the mass-movements incidental to the European war,&quot; one observer wrote in 1916.

===Freight===

* Major freight yards were at South Boston, Taunton, Fall River, New Bedford, Providence (Northup Avenue Yard), Worcester, Springfield, Hartford, Waterbury, New Haven (the major Cedar Hill hump classification yard), Maybrook (another hump yard and interchange point for western connections), New York Harlem River and New York Bay Ridge (where interchange was made with the PRR and other railroads in New Jersey, via barge (car float)).
* Multiple through freight trains traveled at night between New York or Maybrook and Cedar Hill yard and on to Boston. Other through freights served the yards above as well as intermediate points and also State Line (New York Central interchange), Brockton, Framingham and Lowell (B&amp;M interchange for traffic for Taunton, New Bedford and Fall River).

<doc id="351879" wikidata="Q6767200" url="?curid=351879" title="Mark Critch">
<text>Mark Critch (born May 14, 1974) is a Canadian comedian, actor, and writer. He is best known for his work on the comedy series &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, initially as a writer and then as a regular cast member beginning in 2003.

==Family life==
He is the son of Mike Critch, a longtime journalist for radio station VOCM in St. John&#x27;s, and the younger brother of Mike Critch Jr., a radio DJ for VOCM-FM who uses the name Mike Campbell on the air.

== Career ==
Critch has been a guest on CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;Madly Off in All Directions&quot;, the CBC Television show &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot;, and is the host of CBC TV&#x27;s Halifax Comedy Festival. He performed at the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal and the Winnipeg Comedy Festival. He played the recurring role of Gary Breakfast on the CTV sitcom &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. He appeared in several films, including &quot;Anchor Zone&quot;, &quot;Rare Birds&quot; and &quot;Above and Beyond&quot;. In 2013, Critch played Henry Tilley in &quot;The Grand Seduction&quot;, a remake of Jean-François Pouliot&#x27;s French-Canadian &quot;La Grande Séduction&quot; (2003) directed by Don McKellar. Critch and fellow Newfoundland actor Allan Hawco featured in a documentary entitled &quot;Trail of the Caribou&quot;, which followed the Newfoundland Regiment&#x27;s journey in the First World War. It was released in 2016 to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of the Regiment&#x27;s tragedy at Beaumont Hamel. Critch also appeared in director Matt Johnson&#x27;s 2023 film &quot;BlackBerry&quot;, portraying NHL commissioner Gary Bettman.

Critch reached national notoriety after a &quot;22 Minutes&quot; piece aired in which Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) Carolyn Parrish stepped on a President George W. Bush doll, later causing her to be removed from caucus. He is most famous for his road pieces on the show, in which he accosts celebrities such as John Kerry, Michael Douglas, Alec Baldwin, former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, Howard Dean, Avril Lavigne, Hillary Clinton and Justin Trudeau. Critch&#x27;s impressions are another recurring feature on &quot;22 Minutes&quot;, including those of Donald Trump, Rex Murphy, Don Cherry and former Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams.

== Book and adaptation ==
In 2018, Critch announced the release of his early life memoir, &quot;Son of a Critch&quot;. Published by Penguin Random House Canada, it was released on October 2, 2018, and immediately entered the Globe and Mail bestseller list, where it remained for several weeks. &quot;Son of a Critch&quot; was the winner of the &quot;Margaret and John Savage First Book Award (non-fiction)&quot; at the &quot;Atlantic Book Awards&quot;, and shortlisted for both the 2019 Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour and the 2019 Kobo Emerging Writer Prize. It was also longlisted for the 2019 RBC Taylor Prize. His second book, &quot;An Embarrassment of Critches&quot;, was also shortlisted for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour in 2022.

In 2021, CBC Television and Lionsgate Films announced the production of &quot;Son of a Critch&quot;, a television series adaptation of the book. Critch plays his father (Mike Critch) in the series, while child actor Benjamin Evan Ainsworth plays the young Critch.

== Recognition ==
* David Renton Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor at the Atlantic Film Festival for his role in &quot;The Grand Seduction&quot;.
* Gemini Award
* Canadian Comedy Award
* Writers Guild of Canada Award

== Charitable work ==
Critch is known in Newfoundland and Labrador for his charitable efforts, including serving as honorary chair of the Victoria Park Foundation in St. John&#x27;s, and the honorary fundraising patron of the O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Farm Foundation. He was named the Honorary Chairperson for the Cancer Society of Canada&#x27;s &quot;One Night Stand Against Cancer&quot; campaign to raise funds for Nova Scotia&#x27;s Sobey Cancer Support Centre. He has hosted and/or spearheaded fundraising campaigns for the Parkinson&#x27;s Society of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Heart and Stroke Foundation.

On December 7, 2017, the Wonderful Grand Band released a re-recorded version of Babylon Mall for the 50th anniversary of the Avalon Mall, with Critch on vocals. Proceeds from the song remake were donated to the Tommy Sexton Centre.

<text>Mildred Hillary Davis (February 22, 1901August 18, 1969) was an American actress who appeared in fifteen of Harold Lloyd&#x27;s classic silent comedies and eventually married him.

==Early life and career==
The daughter of Howard Beckett Davis, she was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and educated at the Friends School in Philadelphia. After spending several years studying, she traveled to Los Angeles in the hopes of securing a role in a film. After appearing in several small roles, she caught the attention of Hal Roach, who pointed her out to comedian Lloyd. Lloyd was looking for a leading lady to replace Bebe Daniels, and cast Davis in his comedy short &quot;From Hand to Mouth&quot; in 1919. It would be the first of fifteen films they would star in together. 

On February 10, 1923, Davis married Lloyd. After marrying, Lloyd announced that Davis would not appear in any more motion pictures. After much persuasion by Davis (and much grief) she received Lloyd&#x27;s consent for her return to the screen in &quot;Too Many Crooks&quot;, which Lloyd produced through his production company. It was the only acting role she undertook after becoming married.

==Death==
On August 18, 1969, Davis died in St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, California.

<text>Automotive engineering, along with aerospace engineering and naval architecture, is a branch of vehicle engineering, incorporating elements of mechanical, electrical, electronic, software, and safety engineering as applied to the design, manufacture and operation of motorcycles, automobiles, and trucks and their respective engineering subsystems. It also includes modification of vehicles. Manufacturing domain deals with the creation and assembling the whole parts of automobiles is also included in it. The automotive engineering field is research intensive and involves direct application of mathematical models and formulas. The study of automotive engineering is to design, develop, fabricate, and test vehicles or vehicle components from the concept stage to production stage. Production, development, and manufacturing are the three major functions in this field.

==Disciplines==

===Automobile engineering===
Automobile engineering is a branch study of engineering which teaches manufacturing, designing, mechanical mechanisms as well as operations of automobiles.
It is an introduction to vehicle engineering which deals with motorcycles, cars, buses, trucks, etc. It includes branch study of mechanical, electronic, software and safety elements.
Some of the engineering attributes and disciplines that are of importance to the automotive engineer include:

Safety engineering: Safety engineering is the assessment of various crash scenarios and their impact on the vehicle occupants. These are tested against very stringent governmental regulations. Some of these requirements include: seat belt and air bag functionality testing, front and side-impact testing, and tests of rollover resistance. Assessments are done with various methods and tools, including computer crash simulation (typically finite element analysis), crash-test dummy, and partial system sled and full vehicle crashes.

Fuel economy/emissions: Fuel economy is the measured fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon or kilometers per liter. Emissions-testing covers the measurement of vehicle emissions, including hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides (), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (), and evaporative emissions.

NVH engineering (noise, vibration, and harshness): NVH involves customer feedback (both tactile [felt] and audible [heard]) concerning a vehicle. While sound can be interpreted as a rattle, squeal, or hot, a tactile response can be seat vibration or a buzz in the steering wheel. This feedback is generated by components either rubbing, vibrating, or rotating. NVH response can be classified in various ways: powertrain NVH, road noise, wind noise, component noise, and squeak and rattle. Note, there are both good and bad NVH qualities. The NVH engineer works to either eliminate bad NVH or change the &quot;bad NVH&quot; to good (i.e., exhaust tones).

Vehicle electronics: Automotive electronics is an increasingly important aspect of automotive engineering. Modern vehicles employ dozens of electronic systems. These systems are responsible for operational controls such as the throttle, brake and steering controls; as well as many comfort-and-convenience systems such as the HVAC, infotainment, and lighting systems. It would not be possible for automobiles to meet modern safety and fuel-economy requirements without electronic controls.

Performance: Performance is a measurable and testable value of a vehicle&#x27;s ability to perform in various conditions. Performance can be considered in a wide variety of tasks, but it generally considers how quickly a car can accelerate (e.g. standing start 1/4 mile elapsed time, 0–60 mph, etc.), its top speed, how short and quickly a car can come to a complete stop from a set speed (e.g. 70-0 mph), how much g-force a car can generate without losing grip, recorded lap-times, cornering speed, brake fade, etc. Performance can also reflect the amount of control in inclement weather (snow, ice, rain).

Shift quality: Shift quality is the driver&#x27;s perception of the vehicle to an automatic transmission shift event. This is influenced by the powertrain (Internal combustion engine, transmission), and the vehicle (driveline, suspension, engine and powertrain mounts, etc.) Shift feel is both a tactile (felt) and audible (heard) response of the vehicle. Shift quality is experienced as various events: transmission shifts are felt as an upshift at acceleration (1–2), or a downshift maneuver in passing (4–2). Shift engagements of the vehicle are also evaluated, as in Park to Reverse, etc.

Durability / corrosion engineering: Durability and corrosion engineering is the evaluation testing of a vehicle for its useful life. Tests include mileage accumulation, severe driving conditions, and corrosive salt baths.

Drivability: Drivability is the vehicle&#x27;s response to general driving conditions. Cold starts and stalls, RPM dips, idle response, launch hesitations and stumbles, and performance levels all contribute to the overall drivability of any given vehicle.

Cost: The cost of a vehicle program is typically split into the effect on the variable cost of the vehicle, and the up-front tooling and fixed costs associated with developing the vehicle. There are also costs associated with warranty reductions and marketing.

Program timing: To some extent programs are timed with respect to the market, and also to the production-schedules of assembly plants. Any new part in the design must support the development and manufacturing schedule of the model.

Design for manufacturability (DFM): DFM refers to designing vehicular components in such a way that they are not only feasible to manufacture, but also such that they are cost-efficient to produce while resulting in acceptable quality that meets design specifications and engineering tolerances. This requires coördination between the design engineers and the assembly/manufacturing teams.

Quality management: Quality control is an important factor within the production process, as high quality is needed to meet customer requirements and to avoid expensive recall campaigns. The complexity of components involved in the production process requires a combination of different tools and techniques for quality control. Therefore, the International Automotive Task Force (IATF), a group of the world&#x27;s leading manufacturers and trade organizations, developed the standard ISO/TS 16949. This standard defines the design, development, production, and (when relevant) installation and service requirements. Furthermore, it combines the principles of ISO 9001 with aspects of various regional and national automotive standards such as AVSQ (Italy), EAQF (France), VDA6 (Germany) and QS-9000 (USA). In order to further minimize risks related to product failures and liability claims for automotive electric and electronic systems, the quality discipline functional safety according to ISO/IEC 17025 is applied.
Since the 1950s, the comprehensive business approach total quality management (TQM) has operated to continuously improve the production process of automotive products and components. Some of the companies who have implemented TQM include Ford Motor Company, Motorola and Toyota Motor Company.

==Job functions==

===Development engineer===
A development engineer has the responsibility for coordinating delivery of the engineering attributes of a complete automobile (bus, car, truck, van, SUV, motorcycle etc.) as dictated by the automobile manufacturer, governmental regulations, and the customer who buys the product.

Much like the Systems engineer, the development engineer is concerned with the interactions of all systems in the complete automobile. While there are multiple components and systems in an automobile that have to function as designed, they must also work in harmony with the complete automobile. As an example, the brake system&#x27;s main function is to provide braking functionality to the automobile. Along with this, it must also provide an acceptable level of: pedal feel (spongy, stiff), brake system &quot;noise&quot; (squeal, shudder, etc.), and interaction with the ABS (anti-lock braking system)

Another aspect of the development engineer&#x27;s job is a trade-off process required to deliver all of the automobile attributes at a certain acceptable level. An example of this is the trade-off between engine performance and fuel economy. While some customers are looking for maximum power from their engine, the automobile is still required to deliver an acceptable level of fuel economy. From the engine&#x27;s perspective, these are opposing requirements. Engine performance is looking for maximum displacement (bigger, more power), while fuel economy is looking for a smaller displacement engine (ex: 1.4 L vs. 5.4 L). The engine size however, is not the only contributing factor to fuel economy and automobile performance. Different values come into play.

Other attributes that involve trade-offs include: automobile weight, aerodynamic drag, transmission gearing, emission control devices, handling/roadholding, ride quality, and tires.

The development engineer is also responsible for organizing automobile level testing, validation, and certification. Components and systems are designed and tested individually by the Product Engineer. The final evaluation is to be conducted at the automobile level to evaluate system to system interactions. As an example, the audio system (radio) needs to be evaluated at the automobile level. Interaction with other electronic components can cause interference. Heat dissipation of the system and ergonomic placement of the controls need to be evaluated. Sound quality in all seating positions needs to be provided at acceptable levels.

===Manufacturing engineer===
Manufacturing engineers are
responsible for ensuring proper production of the automotive components or complete vehicles. While the development engineers are responsible for the function of the vehicle, manufacturing engineers are responsible for the safe and effective production of the vehicle. This group of engineers consist of process engineers, logistic coordinators, tooling engineers, robotics engineers, and assembly planners.

In the automotive industry manufacturers are playing a larger role in the development stages of automotive components to ensure that the products are easy to manufacture. Design for manufacturability in the automotive world is crucial to make certain whichever design is developed in the Research and Development Stage of automotive design. Once the design is established, the manufacturing engineers take over. They design the machinery and tooling necessary to build the automotive components or vehicle and establish the methods of how to mass-produce the product. It is the manufacturing engineers job to increase the efficiency of the automotive plant and to implement lean manufacturing techniques such as Six Sigma and Kaizen. 

===Other automotive engineering roles===
Other automotive engineers include those listed below:
* Aerodynamics engineers will often give guidance to the styling studio so that the shapes they design are aerodynamic, as well as attractive.
* Body engineers will also let the studio know if it is feasible to make the panels for their designs.
* Change control engineers make sure that all of the design and manufacturing changes that occur are organized, managed and implemented...
* NVH engineers perform sound and vibration testing to prevent loud cabin noises, detectable vibrations, and/or improve the sound quality while the vehicle is on the road.
==The modern automotive product engineering process==
Studies indicate that a substantial part of the modern vehicle&#x27;s value comes from intelligent systems, and that these represent most of the current automotive innovation. To facilitate this, the modern automotive engineering process has to handle an increased use of mechatronics. Configuration and performance optimization, system integration, control, component, subsystem and system-level validation of the intelligent systems must become an intrinsic part of the standard vehicle engineering process, just as this is the case for the structural, vibro-acoustic and kinematic design. This requires a vehicle development process that is typically highly simulation-driven.

===The V-approach===
One way to effectively deal with the inherent multi-physics and the control systems development that is involved when including intelligent systems, is to adopt the V-Model approach to systems development, as has been widely used in the automotive industry for twenty years or more. In this V-approach, system-level requirements are propagated down the V via subsystems to component design, and the system performance is validated at increasing integration levels. Engineering of mechatronic systems requires the application of two interconnected &quot;V-cycles&quot;: one focusing on the multi-physics system engineering (like the mechanical and electrical components of an electrically powered steering system, including sensors and actuators); and the other focuses on the controls engineering, the control logic, the software and realization of the control hardware and embedded software.

<text>Westerplatte (, , ) is a peninsula in Gdańsk, Poland, located on the Baltic Sea coast mouth of the Dead Vistula (one of the Vistula delta estuaries), in the Gdańsk harbour channel. From 1926 to 1939, it was the location of a Polish Military Transit Depot (WST), sanctioned within the territory of the Free City of Danzig (now Gdańsk).

It is famous for the Battle of Westerplatte, which was the first clash between Polish and German forces during the invasion of Poland and thus the beginning and the first battle of World War II.

==History==

===Resort===
The resort was established on the Westerplatte peninsula around 1830 which had a beach, a forested park, a seaside bath complex and health spa facilities.

===The transit depot===
Following the reestablishment of Polish independence in the aftermath of World War I, much of the surrounding region became a part of the Second Polish Republic. The city of Danzig (present day Gdańsk), a historically important port city, at that time predominantly ethnically German, became an independent city state, the Free City of Danzig. The Free City was nominally run by the League of Nations, but over time became increasingly allied with Germany.

In 1921, the League of Nations granted Poland the right to install an ammunition depot near Gdańsk, and station a garrison there. Despite some objections from the Free City, this right was confirmed in 1925, where the location was agreed on with the choice of Westerplatte. Westerplatte was primarily separated from the New Port of the Free City of Danzig by the harbour channel, with only a small pier connecting them to the mainland; the Polish-held part of the Westerplatte was separated from the territory of Danzig by a brick wall. The depot was completed in November 1925 and became operational in January 1926. The Polish garrison&#x27;s size was set at 88 soldiers, and Poland was not allowed to construct fortifications.

On 6 March 1933, in what became known as the westernmost incident (or crisis), the Polish government landed a marine battalion, briefly strengthening the outpost to about 200 men. This was done to demonstrate the Polish resolve to defend the outpost in response to recent comments by German politicians and media figures about the need of border adjustment and Poland and France were secretly discussing preventive war against Germany; on a local level this was also done to put pressure on the Danzig government which was trying to renounce prior agreement on shared Danzig-Polish control over harbor police and take sole control of that unit. Polish troops were withdrawn by 16 March, after protests from the League, Danzig and Germany, in exchange for Danzig withdrawing its objections to the harbor police agreement. According to another source, on 14 March 1933 the League did authorize Poland to strengthen the garrison.

Over the years, the Poles also constructed clandestine fortifications. These were not very impressive: there were no real bunkers or tunnels, but only five small concrete outposts (guardhouses) hidden in the peninsula&#x27;s forest and a large barracks prepared for defence, supported by a network of field fortifications such as trenches and barricades. Several of the buildings were reinforced with concrete. With tensions rising, in early 1939, the garrison was placed on alert.

===Battle of Westerplatte===

On 1 September 1939, only minutes after the German Luftwaffe (air force) had begun the invasion of Poland by dropping bombs in a series of raids on the city of Wieluń by Junkers Ju 87 Stukas, at 04:48 local time, the battleship &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot;, then on a courtesy visit to the Free City of Danzig, without warning opened fire on the Polish garrison. This was followed by an attack by &quot;Oblt.&quot; Wilhelm Henningsen’s storm unit from the Schleswig-Holstein and the &quot;Marinestosstruppkompanie&quot;. Soon after crossing the artillery-breached brick wall, the attackers were ambushed by the Polish defenders, with small arms, mortar and machine-gun fire from concealed and well-positioned firing points that caught them in a crossfire. Another two assaults that day were repelled as well, with the Germans suffering unexpectedly high losses.

Over the coming days, the Germans repeatedly bombarded Westerplatte with naval artillery and heavy field artillery along with dive-bombing raids by Stukas. Repeated attacks by 570 German soldiers were repelled by the 180 Polish soldiers for seven days. Major Henryk Sucharski had been informed that no help from the Polish Army would come. Cut off, with no reinforcements or chance of resupply, he continued his defence, keeping the main German force stalled at Westerplatte and so preventing further attacks along the Polish coast.

On 7 September, the Major decided to surrender, due to lack of ammunition and supplies. As a sign of honour for the soldiers of Westerplatte, the German commander, Gen. Eberhardt, allowed Major Sucharski to keep his sword while being taken prisoner.

===Post-war===
The ruins of the defenders&#x27; barracks and guardhouses are still there. After the war, one of the guardhouses (#1) was converted into a museum. Two 280mm shells from the &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; prop up its entrance.

A Monument of the Coast Defenders (&quot;Pomnik Obrońców Wybrzeża&quot;) was unveiled in 1966.

Westerplatte Museum dedicated to the 1939 battle was created in 2015.

<doc id="351887" wikidata="Q4168796" url="?curid=351887" title="Friendly artificial intelligence">
<text>Friendly artificial intelligence (friendly AI or FAI) is hypothetical artificial general intelligence (AGI) that would have a positive (benign) effect on humanity or at least align with human interests such as fostering the improvement of the human species. It is a part of the ethics of artificial intelligence and is closely related to machine ethics. While machine ethics is concerned with how an artificially intelligent agent &quot;should&quot; behave, friendly artificial intelligence research is focused on how to practically bring about this behavior and ensuring it is adequately constrained.

== Etymology and usage ==

The term was coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky, who is best known for popularizing the idea, to discuss superintelligent artificial agents that reliably implement human values. Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig&#x27;s leading artificial intelligence textbook, &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot;, describes the idea:

Yudkowsky (2008) goes into more detail about how to design a Friendly AI. He asserts that friendliness (a desire not to harm humans) should be designed in from the start, but that the designers should recognize both that their own designs may be flawed, and that the robot will learn and evolve over time. Thus the challenge is one of mechanism design—to define a mechanism for evolving AI systems under a system of checks and balances, and to give the systems utility functions that will remain friendly in the face of such changes.

&quot;Friendly&quot; is used in this context as technical terminology, and picks out agents that are safe and useful, not necessarily ones that are &quot;friendly&quot; in the colloquial sense. The concept is primarily invoked in the context of discussions of recursively self-improving artificial agents that rapidly explode in intelligence, on the grounds that this hypothetical technology would have a large, rapid, and difficult-to-control impact on human society.

== Risks of unfriendly AI ==

The roots of concern about artificial intelligence are very old. Kevin LaGrandeur showed that the dangers specific to AI can be seen in ancient literature concerning artificial humanoid servants such as the golem, or the proto-robots of Gerbert of Aurillac and Roger Bacon. In those stories, the extreme intelligence and power of these humanoid creations clash with their status as slaves (which by nature are seen as sub-human), and cause disastrous conflict. By 1942 these themes prompted Isaac Asimov to create the &quot;Three Laws of Robotics&quot;—principles hard-wired into all the robots in his fiction, intended to prevent them from turning on their creators, or allowing them to come to harm.
In modern times as the prospect of superintelligent AI looms nearer, philosopher Nick Bostrom has said that superintelligent AI systems with goals that are not aligned with human ethics are intrinsically dangerous unless extreme measures are taken to ensure the safety of humanity. He put it this way:

Basically we should assume that a &#x27;superintelligence&#x27; would be able to achieve whatever goals it has. Therefore, it is extremely important that the goals we endow it with, and its entire motivation system, is &#x27;human friendly.&#x27;

In 2008, Eliezer Yudkowsky called for the creation of &quot;friendly AI&quot; to mitigate existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence. He explains: &quot;The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.&quot;

Steve Omohundro says that a sufficiently advanced AI system will, unless explicitly counteracted, exhibit a number of basic &quot;drives&quot;, such as resource acquisition, self-preservation, and continuous self-improvement, because of the intrinsic nature of any goal-driven systems and that these drives will, &quot;without special precautions&quot;, cause the AI to exhibit undesired behavior.

Alexander Wissner-Gross says that AIs driven to maximize their future freedom of action (or causal path entropy) might be considered friendly if their planning horizon is longer than a certain threshold, and unfriendly if their planning horizon is shorter than that threshold.

Luke Muehlhauser, writing for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, recommends that machine ethics researchers adopt what Bruce Schneier has called the &quot;security mindset&quot;: Rather than thinking about how a system will work, imagine how it could fail. For instance, he suggests even an AI that only makes accurate predictions and communicates via a text interface might cause unintended harm.

In 2014, Luke Muehlhauser and Nick Bostrom underlined the need for &#x27;friendly AI&#x27;; nonetheless, the difficulties in designing a &#x27;friendly&#x27; superintelligence, for instance via programming counterfactual moral thinking, are considerable.

== Coherent extrapolated volition ==
Yudkowsky advances the Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) model. According to him, our coherent extrapolated volition is &quot;our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted&quot;.

Rather than a Friendly AI being designed directly by human programmers, it is to be designed by a &quot;seed AI&quot; programmed to first study human nature and then produce the AI that humanity would want, given sufficient time and insight, to arrive at a satisfactory answer. The appeal to an objective through contingent human nature (perhaps expressed, for mathematical purposes, in the form of a utility function or other decision-theoretic formalism), as providing the ultimate criterion of &quot;Friendliness&quot;, is an answer to the meta-ethical problem of defining an objective morality; extrapolated volition is intended to be what humanity objectively would want, all things considered, but it can only be defined relative to the psychological and cognitive qualities of present-day, unextrapolated humanity.

== Other approaches ==

Steve Omohundro has proposed a &quot;scaffolding&quot; approach to AI safety, in which one provably safe AI generation helps build the next provably safe generation.

Seth Baum argues that the development of safe, socially beneficial artificial intelligence or artificial general intelligence is a function of the social psychology of AI research communities and so can be constrained by extrinsic measures and motivated by intrinsic measures. Intrinsic motivations can be strengthened when messages resonate with AI developers; Baum argues that, in contrast, &quot;existing messages about beneficial AI are not always framed well&quot;. Baum advocates for &quot;cooperative relationships, and positive framing of AI researchers&quot; and cautions against characterizing AI researchers as &quot;not want(ing) to pursue beneficial designs&quot;.

In his book &quot;Human Compatible&quot;, AI researcher Stuart J. Russell lists three principles to guide the development of beneficial machines. He emphasizes that these principles are not meant to be explicitly coded into the machines; rather, they are intended for the human developers. The principles are as follows:

The &quot;preferences&quot; Russell refers to &quot;are all-encompassing; they cover everything you might care about, arbitrarily far into the future.&quot; Similarly, &quot;behavior&quot; includes any choice between options, and the uncertainty is such that some probability, which may be quite small, must be assigned to every logically possible human preference.

== Public policy ==
James Barrat, author of &quot;Our Final Invention&quot;, suggested that &quot;a public-private partnership has to be created to bring A.I.-makers together to share ideas about security—something like the International Atomic Energy Agency, but in partnership with corporations.&quot; He urges AI researchers to convene a meeting similar to the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, which discussed risks of biotechnology. 

John McGinnis encourages governments to accelerate friendly AI research. Because the goalposts of friendly AI are not necessarily eminent, he suggests a model similar to the National Institutes of Health, where &quot;Peer review panels of computer and cognitive scientists would sift through projects and choose those that are designed both to advance AI and assure that such advances would be accompanied by appropriate safeguards.&quot; McGinnis feels that peer review is better &quot;than regulation to address technical issues that are not possible to capture through bureaucratic mandates&quot;. McGinnis notes that his proposal stands in contrast to that of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which generally aims to avoid government involvement in friendly AI.

== Criticism ==
Some critics believe that both human-level AI and superintelligence are unlikely and that, therefore, friendly AI is unlikely. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alan Winfield compares human-level artificial intelligence with faster-than-light travel in terms of difficulty and states that while we need to be &quot;cautious and prepared&quot; given the stakes involved, we &quot;don&#x27;t need to be obsessing&quot; about the risks of superintelligence. Boyles and Joaquin, on the other hand, argue that Luke Muehlhauser and Nick Bostrom’s proposal to create friendly AIs appear to be bleak. This is because Muehlhauser and Bostrom seem to hold the idea that intelligent machines could be programmed to think counterfactually about the moral values that human beings would have had. In an article in &quot;AI &amp; Society&quot;, Boyles and Joaquin maintain that such AIs would not be that friendly considering the following: the infinite amount of antecedent counterfactual conditions that would have to be programmed into a machine, the difficulty of cashing out the set of moral values—that is, those that are more ideal than the ones human beings possess at present, and the apparent disconnect between counterfactual antecedents and ideal value consequent.

Some philosophers claim that any truly &quot;rational&quot; agent, whether artificial or human, will naturally be benevolent; in this view, deliberate safeguards designed to produce a friendly AI could be unnecessary or even harmful. Other critics question whether artificial intelligence can be friendly. Adam Keiper and Ari N. Schulman, editors of the technology journal &quot;The New Atlantis&quot;, say that it will be impossible ever to guarantee &quot;friendly&quot; behavior in AIs because problems of ethical complexity will not yield to software advances or increases in computing power. They write that the criteria upon which friendly AI theories are based work &quot;only when one has not only great powers of prediction about the likelihood of myriad possible outcomes but certainty and consensus on how one values the different outcomes.

The inner workings of advanced AI systems may be complex and difficult to interpret, leading to concerns about transparency and accountability.

Gubarev graduated from the Soviet Naval Aviation School in 1952 and went on to serve with the Soviet Air Force. He undertook further studies at the Gagarin Air Force Academy before being accepted into the space programme.

<text>Lieutenant Roméo Sabourin (January 1, 1923 – September 14, 1944) was a Canadian soldier and spy during World War II.

== Biography ==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Sabourin joined the Canadian Army, serving in the Canadian Intelligence Corps. Because of his training and fluency in both the French and the English languages, he was recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE).

From London, he was parachuted into occupied France where he worked with the French Resistance, but was captured by the Gestapo with members of the Robert Benoist group and shipped to Buchenwald concentration camp on August 27, 1944.

Twenty-one-year-old Roméo Sabourin was executed by the Nazis on September 14, 1944, along with two other Canadian SOE agents, Frank Pickersgill and John Kenneth Macalister.

Lieutenant Sabourin is honored on the Groesbeek Memorial in the Groesbeek Canadian War Cemetery in the Netherlands. As one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of France, Lieutenant Sabourin is listed on the &quot;Roll of Honor&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre département.
