<text>The Inter-American Court of Human Rights (I/A Court H.R.) is an international court based in San José, Costa Rica. Together with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, it was formed by the American Convention on Human Rights, a human rights treaty ratified by members of the Organization of American States (OAS).

Pursuant to American Convention, the Inter-American Court works with the Inter-American Commission to uphold and promote basic rights and freedoms. It has jurisdiction within around 20 of the 35 member states in the American continent that have taken steps to accede to its authority, the vast majority in Latin America. The court adjudicates claims of human rights violations by governments, and issues advisory opinions on interpretations of certain legal matters. Twenty-nine OAS members are also members of the wider-scale International Criminal Court.

== Purpose and functions ==

The Organization of American States established the Court in 1979 to enforce and interpret the provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights. Its two main functions are thus adjudicatory and advisory. Under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it. Under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states.

=== Adjudicatory function ===
The adjudicatory function requires the Court to rule on cases brought before it in which a state party to the convention, and thus has accepted its jurisdiction, is accused of a human rights violation.

In addition to ratifying the convention, a state party must voluntarily submit to the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction for it to be competent to hear a case involving that state. Acceptance of contentious jurisdiction can be given on a blanket basis – to date, Argentina, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela and Uruguay have done so (though Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela have subsequently withdrawn) – or, alternatively, a state can agree to abide by the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction in a specific, individual case.

Under the convention, cases can be referred to the Court by either the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights or a state party. In contrast to the European human rights system, individual citizens of the OAS member states are not allowed to take cases directly to the Court.

The following conditions must be met:
*Individuals who believe that their rights have been violated must first lodge a complaint with the commission and have that body rule on the admissibility of the claim.
*If the case is ruled admissible and the state deemed at fault, the commission will generally serve the state with a list of recommendations to make amends for the violation.
*Only if the state fails to abide by these recommendations, or if the Commission decides that the case is of particular importance or legal interest, will the case be referred to the Court.
*The presentation of a case before the Court can therefore be considered a measure of last resort, taken only after the commission has failed to resolve the matter in a non-contentious fashion.

Proceedings before the Court are divided into written and oral phases.

==== Written phase ====
In the written phase, the case application is filed, indicating the facts of the case, the plaintiffs, the evidence and witnesses the applicant plans to present at trial, and the claims for redress and costs. If the application is ruled admissible by the Court&#x27;s secretary, notice thereof is served on the judges, the state or the commission (depending on who lodged the application), the victims or their next-of-kin, the other member states, and OAS headquarters.

For 30 days following notification, any of the parties in the case may submit a brief containing preliminary objections to the application.
If it deems necessary, the Court can convene a hearing to deal with the preliminary objections.
Otherwise, in the interests of procedural economy, it can deal with the parties&#x27; preliminary objections and the merits of the case at the same hearing.

Within 60 days following notification, the respondent must supply a written answer to the application, stating whether it accepts or disputes the facts and claims it contains.

Once this answer has been submitted, any of the parties in the case may request the Court president&#x27;s permission to lodge additional pleadings prior to the commencement of the oral phase.

==== Oral phase ====
The president sets the date for the start of oral proceedings, for which the Court is considered quorate with the presence of five judges.

During the oral phase, the judges may ask any question they see fit of any of the persons appearing before them. Witnesses, expert witnesses, and other persons admitted to the proceedings may, at the president&#x27;s discretion, be questioned by the representatives of the commission or the state, or by the victims, their next-of-kin, or their agents, as applicable. The president is permitted to rule on the relevance of questions asked and to excuse the person asked the question from replying, unless overruled by the Court.

===Ruling===

After hearing the witnesses and experts and analyzing the evidence presented, the Court issues its judgment.
Its deliberations are conducted in private and, once the judgment has been adopted, it is notified to all the parties involved.
If the merits judgment does not cover the applicable reparations for the case, they must be determined at a separate hearing or through some other procedure as decided on by the Court.

The reparations the Court orders can be both monetary and non-monetary in nature. The most direct form of redress are cash compensation payments extended to the victims or their next-of-kin. However, the state can also be required to grant benefits in kind, to offer public recognition of its responsibility, to take steps to prevent similar violations occurring in the future, and other forms of non-monetary compensation.

For example, in its November 2001 judgment in the Barrios Altos case – dealing with the massacre in Lima, Peru, of 15 people at the hands of the state-sponsored Colina Group death squad in November 1991 – the Court ordered payments of US$175,000 for the four survivors and for the next-of-kin of the murdered victims and a payment of $250,000 for the family of one of the victims.
It also required Peru:
* to grant the victims&#x27; families free health care and various forms of educational support, including scholarships and supplies of school uniforms, equipment, and books;
* to repeal two controversial amnesty laws;
* to establish the crime of extrajudicial killing in its domestic law;
* to ratify the International Convention on the Nonapplicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity;
* to publish the Court&#x27;s judgment in the national media;
* to publicly apologize for the incident and to undertake to prevent similar events from recurring in the future;
* and to erect a memorial monument to the victims of the massacre.

While the Court&#x27;s decisions admit no appeal, parties can lodge requests for interpretation with the Court secretary within 90 days of judgment being issued. When possible, requests for interpretation are heard by the same panel of judges that ruled on the merits.

=== Advisory function ===

The Court&#x27;s advisory function enables it to respond to consultations submitted by OAS agencies and member states regarding the interpretation of the convention or other instruments governing human rights in the Americas; it also empowers it to give advice on domestic laws and proposed legislation, and to clarify whether or not they are compatible with the convention&#x27;s provisions. This advisory jurisdiction is available to all OAS member states, not only those that have ratified the convention and accepted the Court&#x27;s adjudicatory function. The Court&#x27;s replies to these consultations are published separately from its contentious judgments, as advisory opinions.

==Ratification and membership==
The American Convention on Human Rights entered into force in 1978. All Latin American countries but Cuba are members, as are Suriname and a few Anglophone countries in the Caribbean.

The following Latin American nation-builders were concerned to build the rule of law: Simón Bolívar, Antonio José de Sucre, Mariano Moreno, Mariano Gálvez, and Dionisio de Herrera.
Trinidad and Tobago signed the convention on 28 May 1991 but suspended its ratification on 26 May 1998 (effective 26 May 1999) over the death penalty.

In 1999 under President Alberto Fujimori Peru announced it was withdrawing its acceptance of the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction. This decision was reversed by the transitional government of Valentín Paniagua in 2001.

Venezuela withdrew from the convention in 2013 under the Nicolás Maduro government. On 15 May 2019, the National Assembly (opposition Guaidó government) nullified the withdrawal.

The Dominican Republic stated in 2014 that it was withdrawing from the I/A Court H.R., the withdrawal would have come into effect the following year. However, the I/A Court H.R. notes that the withdrawal was never legally implemented, and as of its 2017 annual report, the I/A Court H.R. still counted the Dominican Republic as a member.

The United States signed but never ratified the American Convention on Human Rights.

== Composition ==

The court consists of seven judges, held to the highest moral judgement who have a high competency in human rights law. These judges are elected to six-year terms by the OAS General Assembly; each judge may be reelected for an additional six-year term.

Recent policy changes state, when serving on the court, judges are expected to act as individuals, not representing their state. They must be OAS member states&#x27; nationals; however, they do not need to be individuals of a state that has ratified the American Convention or accepted jurisdiction of the Court. Judges are required to recuse themselves from cases involving their home country. States parties are no longer permitted to name a judge ad hoc to their case if a sitting judge is not from their country. If a judge is a national of one of the State Parties to the case, the State Parties can only designate a judge ad hoc if there are inter-state complaints. In order to be nominated as a judge, one must be a national of a member state of OAS, a jurist, have the &#x27;highest moral authority&#x27;, have high competency of human rights law, have &#x27;the qualifications required for the exercise of the highest judicial functions in conformity with the law of the state of which they are nationals or of the state that proposes them as candidates&#x27;.

&#x27;Highest Moral Authority&#x27; is loosely defined by the ACHR as never having never been convicted of a crime, suspended or expelled from the legal profession, or dismissed from public office.

Judges are elected by State Parties to the convention from a list of nominated candidates. Each State Party may nominate up to three candidates, but if nominating three, at least one of the three must be a national of a state other than the nominating state. The Secretary General of the OAS organizes the candidates alphabetically and forwards it to the State Parties. The election consists of a secret ballot, requiring an absolute majority of the State Parties to the convention. Those who receive the most votes are elected.

After the Convention came into force on 18 July 1978, the first election of judges took place on 22 May 1979. The new Court first convened on 29 June 1979 at the Organization of American States Headquarters in Washington, D.C., United States.

== Criticism ==

The Court&#x27;s behaviour has also been criticized. Among other issues, some authors have criticized the politicization of the Court. Furthermore, the process of nomination and election is a subject of criticism. It is not a transparent or accountable process at both the National and International levels. There is a push for the OAS to create an independent group in charge of evaluating candidates. Another independent group in charge of overseeing the national processes and ranking the candidates that is separate from OAS is a proposed initiative by scholars to address these criticisms. These would ensure that all candidates have been through two reviews on the National and International level before being able to be elected.

Fair representation when it comes to candidates is also a point of contention. Scholars have stated that State Parties should strive for equal representation in terms of geographic sub-regions, different ethnic and cultural groups, and female and male judges; however, this should be done without straying from the high standards and qualifications required for candidates.

&quot;Highest Moral Authority&quot;, a requirement for nomination, is often criticized because its vagueness. The necessary qualifications are not clearly defined and vary from country to country. The minimum age ranges from none to 45 years old and the number of years of experience ranges from 10 to 15 years and only Paraguay requires candidates to have a PhD.

Some of the latest criticisms come from Peru and Venezuela. Venezuela subsequently withdrew from the system after President Hugo Chávez declared the court&#x27;s decision to rule Venezuela guilty of holding a prisoner in inhumane jail conditions as invalid. Up to then, Trinidad and Tobago had been the only state to withdraw. Peru tried to do so, but did not follow the appropriate procedure.

<doc id="340072" wikidata="Q1612516" url="?curid=340072" title="Wayne and Shuster">
<text>Wayne and Shuster were a Canadian comedy duo formed by Johnny Wayne and Frank Shuster. They were active professionally from the early 1940s until the late 1980s, first as a live act, then on radio, then as part of &quot;The Army Show&quot; that entertained troops in Europe during World War II, and then on both Canadian and American television.

Wayne (born Louis Weingarten; May 28, 1918 – July 18, 1990) and Shuster (September 5, 1916 – January 13, 2002) were well known in Canada, and were Ed Sullivan&#x27;s most frequently recurring guests, appearing a record 67 times on his show. Despite repeated suggestions that they should move to the United States to further their careers, the duo chose to stay in Canada.

==Beginnings==
Wayne and Shuster were born in the same neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and met in grade school. In 1931, while students at Harbord Collegiate Institute, they performed their first skit together for their Boy Scout troop, and, as part of the school drama club, continued to entertain fellow students. They both studied at the University of Toronto, where they wrote and performed as &quot;Shuster and Wayne&quot;.

==Radio==

In 1941, they made their radio debut on CFRB in their own show, &quot;The Javex Wife Preservers&quot;, for which they were each paid $12.50 per week to dispense household hints in a humorous fashion. Their popularity on CFRB, at the time a top-rated Toronto radio station, soon landed the pair on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (CBC) Trans-Canada Network as part of the Buckingham Cigarette &quot;Blended Rhythm Show&quot;.

They enlisted in the Canadian Army in 1942, and were immediately assigned to &quot;The Canadian Army Radio Show&quot;, which was produced in Montreal. Shuster and Wayne wrote most of the music, lyrics and skits, and were part of a cast that featured the singers Jimmie Shields and Raymonde Maranda. The radio show was a success, resulting in &quot;The Army Show&quot;, a touring stage version that opened in Toronto in April 1943 to popular acclaim. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; called it &quot;a high-spirited, always likeable, often lavish soldier show... Two Toronto sergeants, 26-year-old Frank Shuster and 24-year-old Johnny Wayne, had authored a peppy book, some perky tunes and lyrics.&quot; The revue travelled across Canada in 1943 to entertain troops and help with the sale of Victory Bonds, and included a stop at the Quebec Conference. In addition to Shuster and Wayne, the cast included the singer Roger Doucet, Brian and Dennis Farnon, Denny Vaughan, and Lois Hooker (who later, as Lois Maxwell, starred as Miss Moneypenny in fourteen James Bond films). In late 1943, the revue was split up into five units and sent to England to entertain troops. Shuster and Wayne again prepared most of the material for all the units, and were assigned to a unit that followed Canadian troops into France following D-Day. The duo often performed close enough to the front lines that they had to contend with snipers, strafing and even a relatively close encounter with an exploding V-1 &quot;buzz bomb&quot;.

After demobilization, Shuster and Wayne returned to Toronto and started &quot;The RCA Victor Show&quot; on CBC Radio. An advertising executive suggested that &quot;Wayne &amp; Shuster&quot; sounded better than &quot;Shuster &amp; Wayne&quot;. Since the order of their names wasn&#x27;t important to the two, they agreed to the change. (Alex Barris later recalled that they had a CBC office with two doors — one read &quot;Wayne &amp; Shuster&quot;, the other was &quot;Shuster &amp; Wayne&quot;.) Their popularity rapidly grew and CBC changed the name of their radio programme to &quot;The Wayne &amp; Shuster Show.&quot; By 1950, their Canadian weekly audience numbered 3 million. They also began to make a name for themselves in the U.S. when they were hired to make a radio network series to replace William Bendix&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; while it was on summer hiatus in 1947.

==Television==
Wayne &amp; Shuster first appeared on television in 1950, but not in Canada, which did not have network TV until 1952. Their radio sponsor, Toni Home Permanent, also sponsored an American television show, &quot;Toni Twin Time&quot;, hosted by Jack Lemmon. The sponsor asked the duo to make regular appearances on the TV program, which was not doing well. After two shows, a sponsor executive asked them to take over the hosting duties from Lemmon, who was young, inexperienced, and obviously nervous. However, they were unsure about this new medium of television, and turned down the offer.

In 1952, CBC producer Mavor Moore approached them about doing a regular live comedy show on the new CBC Television network, but after watching Milton Berle dealing with all of the details of lighting, sound, music and audience while broadcasting live from New York City, the two were even more concerned about the demands of live television. They agreed to make an appearance in one CBC television show in 1952 in Montreal, but turned down the opportunity to produce a regular show in Toronto. Wayne said, &quot;You guys don&#x27;t know anything about television. We don&#x27;t either. Why don&#x27;t we wait until we both know something about it?&quot;

Two years later, in 1954, they finally agreed to host a regular comedy show on CBC. In 1955, on one of their shows, they presented a Shakespearean spoof called &quot;Rinse the Blood Off My Toga&quot;, which they also presented on British television the same year. A literary mashup of William Shakespeare and Mickey Spillane, the sketch features a hard-boiled Roman private eye hired by Brutus to investigate the murder of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March. As with many of their scripts, &quot;Rinse the Blood Off My Toga&quot; assumed the audience had a working knowledge of history, Shakespeare, and sometimes even Latin. In 1958, in response to the opening of the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario, they created &quot;A Shakespearean Baseball Game&quot;, written in iambic pentameter and rhyming couplets, and featuring lines lifted from &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;. (&quot;O, what a rogue and bush league slob am I!... O, curséd fate, that I, who led the league, should bat .208.&quot;) In later years, they considered this their favourite script.

Lorraine Thomson, who often appeared on their live broadcasts in the 1950s, called their writing &quot;a kind of cross between a more erudite British sense of humour and the more American vaudevillian sense of humour. They treated their audiences with respect.&quot;

In 1958, they signed a one-year contract with Ed Sullivan to appear regularly on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; for $7,500 a show; that included a handshake agreement that Sullivan would not cut or edit their sketches, which tended to run 12 minutes or longer; their first sketch was a 14-minute re-run of the sketch they had done for CBC and British television, &quot;Rinse the Blood Off My Toga&quot;. (Singer Eartha Kitt once asked Frank Shuster, &quot;What have you got on Ed Sullivan?&quot; after Sullivan cut one of her songs from a program, but left Wayne &amp; Shuster&#x27;s 12-minute sketch intact.) The only time Sullivan asked for an edit was in order to remove a joke about Southern lynchings; he was worried about offending network stations in the Southern U.S. Sullivan loved the Canadian duo and renewed their contract repeatedly; they appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; a record 67 times over the next 11 years. Frank Shuster later disputed this, telling TV critic Jim Bawden that &quot;We were on Ed 58 times. The record books say 67, but that&#x27;s wrong.&quot;

Ed Sullivan advised the two, despite their success in the U.S., to remain in Toronto. They took his advice and turned down many offers to move to the United States permanently. In later years, Shuster often told the story of one agent who tried to get them to move to Hollywood, insisting, &quot;You know, Frank, there&#x27;s more to life than happiness.&quot;

Regardless of their home address, in 1962, and again in 1963, they were ranked as the best comedy routine in America by Motion Picture Daily and Television Today, and co-starred in a CBS-TV sitcom, &quot;Holiday Lodge&quot;, which aired as a summer replacement for (and was produced by) Jack Benny in 1961.

In 1964, Wayne &amp; Shuster created a series of six short documentaries for CBC Television (later presented on CBS during the 1966 summer season) about comedians such as W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers, with music scored by John Williams, titled &quot;Wayne &amp; Shuster Take an Affectionate Look at...&quot;. They made another six episodes the following year. In 1965 &quot;The Wayne &amp; Shuster Hour&quot; won the Silver Rose at the Rose d&#x27;Or Television Festival.

In 1962 and again in 1965, the pair went to Britain and produced Wayne &amp; Shuster specials for the BBC.

In the 1960s, they moved from a weekly television show to monthly &quot;Wayne &amp; Shuster&quot; comedy specials on CBC Television. By the 1970s, they were producing three to four comedy specials per year, which often drew Canadian television ratings of more than two million viewers.

Wayne and Shuster&#x27;s skits often employed large casts of characters, and supporting players included Canadian actors Don Cullen, Jack Duffy, Tom Harvey, Bill Kemp, Paul Kligman, Ben Lennick, Sylvia Lennick, Pegi Loder, Les Rubie, Eric Christmas, Joe Austin, Larry Mann, Paul Soles, Marilyn Stuart, Roy Wordsworth, John Davies, Carol Robinson, Lou Pitoscia, Peggy Mahon, Don Ewer, Howard Swinson and Keith Hampshire. For many years, their music director was Canadian jazz artist Norman Amadio.

Wayne and Shuster were infamous for their vociferous arguments during scriptwriting sessions, television production and editing sessions. Wayne especially was particularly exacting during production and often took the studio crew to task for perceived faults. The technicians often responded by refusing to work overtime at the end of the day. During one sketch, some crew members were instructed to throw fruit and vegetables at both of the comedians from off-camera. Instead, the crew only hurled fruit at Wayne. One floor director remembered Wayne as &quot;two people. On the [studio] floor he was a son of a bitch, but outside he was one of the nicest guys you could meet.&quot; Despite their temperamental reputation in the studio, both were friendly, thoughtful and welcoming outside of work.

Because of their combative natures in the studio, the two agreed early on to not mix socially. Shortly after their CBC radio show became popular, Wayne told Shuster that he was organizing a party, but that he wasn&#x27;t going to invite his partner &quot;because we&#x27;re always together and we&#x27;ll start in about the business. So, to hell with that.&quot; Shuster agreed, and from that point on, they led completely separate lives away from work, with different interests and hobbies.

==Later career==
By the late 1970s, critics were calling their comedy irrelevant and out of date, but their Canadian TV ratings remained strong. In 1980, CBC re-packaged their material into 80 half-hour specials that were syndicated worldwide.

The pair continued to produce comedy specials until Wayne&#x27;s death from cancer in 1990. After Wayne&#x27;s death, Shuster went back into the editing suite and from almost 40 years of their television shows, produced a retrospective series of twenty-two shows, which he also hosted. In 1999, three years before his death, he hosted a one-hour compendium of their work, &quot;Wayne &amp; Shuster: The First Hundred Years&quot;.

== Awards ==

*After Wayne&#x27;s death in 1990, the duo received a special Gemini Award for their outstanding contribution to Canadian television.
*In 1996, Shuster accepted the Margaret Collier Award for the duo&#x27;s comedy writing
*In 1996, Shuster was named an officer of the Order of Canada.
*In 1999, Wayne and Shuster were inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.
*In 2012, the duo were recognized with a Heritage Toronto plaque at their old high school, Harbord Collegiate Institute.
*In 2019, a lane in the Bathurst/Harbord area where they grew up was named Wayne and Shuster Lane.

==Other media==
In 2000, Australian music group The Avalanches created a track called &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot;, which was built on various samples of previously recorded material, most noticeably the Wayne &amp; Shuster sketch &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot;. (Audio clips of two other Wayne and Shuster sketches were also used in creating the track, along with samples of dozens of pieces of music.) &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot; was released as a single, and became a hit in the UK, reaching No. 18 on the charts. Johnny Wayne vocalizes the song&#x27;s repeated refrain &quot;that boy needs therapy&quot;; both Wayne and Frank Shuster are the featured voices throughout verses one and two.

<text>Johnny Wayne (born Louis Weingarten, also given as John Louis Weingarten; May 28, 1918 – July 18, 1990) was a Canadian comedian and comedy writer best known for his work as part of the comedy duo Wayne and Shuster alongside Frank Shuster (1916–2002).

== Personal life ==

The son of a successful clothing manufacturer who spoke several languages, Charles Bryon Weingarten and mother Sarah, and the eldest of seven children, Johnny Wayne was born in downtown Toronto, in the College/Spadina area, and attended Harbord Collegiate Institute, where he met his future comedy partner, and later attended the University of Toronto, majoring in English literature.

Starting with entertaining scouts, he and Shuster wrote some original scores and performed at the university&#x27;s &quot;Hart House Follies&quot;.

== Professional life == 

Wayne and Shuster began working together in the 1930s and continued their successful collaboration on stage, radio, and television until Wayne&#x27;s death. Wayne played to Shuster&#x27;s straight man.

During World War II Wayne enlisted with the Canadian Army with Shuster, assigned to The Army Show (1942–1945), a troop entertainment unit like ENSA, including stage-performing soon after the Normandy landings of June 1944.

Following the war, they produced material for the Department of Veteran Affairs, before rejoining CBC Radio in 1946, producing 39 half-hour episodes a year, until 1953. Wayne with Shuster went to the new medium of television in the mid-1950s.

The duo appeared in &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in May 1958, and were considered as Canada&#x27;s comedy ambassadors, later going on to produce for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation until 1989. 

He had musical talents and was a successful songwriter in the 1950s, including co-writing Bobby Gimby&#x27;s 1958 hit &quot;Jimbo&quot;. In 1964 he recorded the song &quot;Charlottetown&quot;, which he wrote and sang for the Canadian Confederation Centennial.

In 1999 the pair were given a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

== Later life == 

Wayne was a curling enthusiast and was a commentator alongside Alex Trebek and Doug Maxwell during the 1968 CBC Curling Championship.

He married Beatrice Lokash, in 1946. They were married until her death from cancer in 1980.

They were parents to three children, one of whom is notable historian Michael Wayne.

Wayne died from brain cancer in 1990. He is buried at Holy Blossom Cemetery, in his home town of Toronto.

<text>Frank Shuster, (September 5, 1916 – January 13, 2002) was a Canadian comedian best known as a member of the comedy duo Wayne and Shuster, alongside Johnny Wayne. Wayne played to Shuster&#x27;s straight man. 

== Early life ==
Shuster was born to a Jewish immigrant family in Toronto, Ontario, and spent part of his childhood in Niagara Falls. Shuster was originally Shusterovich. His family returned to Toronto in the College/Spadina area, in time for Shuster to attend high school at Toronto&#x27;s Harbord Collegiate Institute, where he met Johnny Wayne in 1930. 

The two would soon be performing sketches and routines at school talent shows, continuing to do the same when they both attended the University of Toronto, majoring in English literature. Starting with entertaining scouts, he and Shuster wrote some original scores and performed at the university&#x27;s &quot;Hart House Follies&quot;.

== Professional career == 

By the early 1940s Wayne and Shuster began appearing on local radio station CFRB, and during World War II they joined the Canadian Army as performers, entertaining Canadian troops, and performed on the CBC Radio series &quot;The Army Show&quot;. 

After the war, the duo appeared on CBC radio and television, becoming a network fixture with regular appearances from the 1940s through the 1980s. They appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; 66 times. The duo would remain a comedy team for 50 years, until Wayne&#x27;s death in 1990. 

In 1996, Shuster was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

== Later life ==

Shuster was married to Ruth Shuster , and had two children, Rosie and Steve. Rosie Shuster (b. 1950) was a comedy writer for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and other television programs, and former wife of Lorne Michaels. Steve Shuster, a standup comic, writer, musician, and actor, died in 2017 at the age of 67.

He was also the cousin of Joe Shuster, co-creator of &quot;Superman&quot;.

Shuster died on January 13, 2002, in Toronto, Ontario, at the age of 85.

<text>The A23 road is a major road in the United Kingdom between London and Brighton, East Sussex, England. It is managed by Transport for London for the section inside the Greater London boundary, Surrey County Council and West Sussex County Council for the section shadowed by the M23 motorway, National Highways (as a trunk road) between the M23 and Patcham, and by Brighton and Hove Council from the A27 to the centre of Brighton.

The road has been a major route for centuries, and seen numerous upgrades, bypasses and diversions.

== Route ==
The A23 begins near Lambeth North tube station. Formerly, it started as &quot;Westminster Bridge Road&quot; near Waterloo station, but this is now part of the A302. Almost immediately it turns south; the straightness of much of the heading south shows its Roman origins.

The road becomes:
* Kennington Road: long; near Kennington Park it joins the A3 (&quot;Kennington Park Road&quot;), but soon bears south again, becoming in turn over the next :
* Brixton Road
* Brixton Hill
* Streatham Hill
* Streatham High Road
* at Norbury the road becomes &quot;London Road&quot;; after , at
* Thornton Heath the Croydon bypass, &quot;Thornton Road&quot; and then Purley Way (known for its superstores, particularly IKEA, and for the site of Croydon Airport) takes the place of the original road through Croydon, now the A235, rejoining the A23 at Purley near the Purley War Memorial Hospital, now named Brighton Road.
* continuing south through Coulsdon on the Farthing Way (the relief road for Coulsdon town centre, opened in 2006), over the North Downs to Hooley, the start of the M23 motorway.
** &quot;here is now Surrey&quot;
* through the built-up areas of Merstham, Redhill and Salfords, skirting Horley
** &quot;here is now West Sussex&quot;
* making an end-on connection with the M23 spur to Gatwick Airport the A23 becomes a dual carriageway as it is diverted round the airport; it rejoins the original route at Lowfield Heath and continues south into Crawley as &quot;London Road&quot;
* Crawley bypass: the original road was through the town
* Pease Pottage, southern junction with the M23
* through the relatively rural countryside of West Sussex, before following along valleys to cross the South Downs and entering Brighton
**&quot;here is now East Sussex&quot;
* becomes the London Road, Brighton, passing under the London Road railway viaduct 
* the road ends at Old Steine, Brighton, at a roundabout intersecting with the coastal A259 road, and opposite the entrance to the Palace Pier.

== Major roads intersected by the A23 ==
* A3 and A202 at Kennington
* A205 South Circular Road at Streatham Hill
* A214 at Streatham
* A232 at Waddon
* M23 close to Junction 7 (no southbound access)
* A25 at Redhill
* A264 at Crawley
* M23 at Pease Pottage
* A272 at Bolney
* A27 Brighton Bypass at Mill Road Roundabout

==History==
What is now the A23 became an arterial route following the construction of Westminster Bridge in 1750 and the consequent improvement of roads leading to the bridge south of the river by the turnpike trusts. The increase in population of Brighton in the late eighteenth century, which transformed it from a small fishing village to a large seaside resort, enhanced the importance of this road, as did the residence there of George IV, as Prince of Wales, who made Brighton a place of fashion.

When roads were originally classified, the A23 started at Purley Cross. The road north of this section, including Purley Way, which opened to traffic in April 1925, was part of the A22. The current route north to Westminster Bridge dates from April 1935.

The A23 in London has frequently been one of the city&#x27;s most congested roads. The M23 motorway was originally proposed to run as far north as Streatham, relieving congestion on the route, but the section north of Hooley was never built. At junction 7 of the M23 motorway, signs for the northbound M23 (which terminates a few miles to the north) simply read &quot;Croydon&quot; with no other London destinations marked.

In July 2000, control of the section of road inside the Greater London boundary was transferred from the Highways Agency to Transport for London. This caused delays to a planned relief road of Coulsdon, which had been announced in 1998. The then mayor, Ken Livingstone apologised in 2002 that TfL was unable to construct the relief road due to a lack of funds. The road was eventually completed in 2007, and which under TfL&#x27;s ownership had acquired a bus lane that suffered ridicule for not having any buses actually running on it.

On 18 March 2010, plans to widen the section between Handcross and Warninglid in West Sussex to three lanes, removing an accident prone bend, were given the go ahead. Work started in autumn 2011 and the scheme was completed and opened in October 2014, with a better-than-expected improvement to safety.

==London to Brighton Veteran Run==
The road from London to Brighton forms the basis of the route of the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. This is featured in the film &quot;Genevieve&#x27;:, although most of the rural motoring scenes were shot in Buckinghamshire. The A23 is also used for various other London to Brighton events, although in many cases part of the route diverges to parallel roads to reduce congestion or add variety.

<text>The A38, parts of which are known as Devon Expressway, Bristol Road and Gloucester Road, is a major A-class trunk road in England.

The road runs from Bodmin in Cornwall to Mansfield in Nottinghamshire. It is long, making it the longest two digit A road in England. It was formerly known as the &quot;Leeds–Exeter Trunk Road&quot;, when this description also included the A61. Before the opening of the M5 motorway in the 1960s and 1970s, the A38 formed the main &quot;holiday route&quot; from the Midlands to Somerset, Devon and Cornwall.

Considerable lengths of the road in the West Midlands closely follow Roman roads, including part of Icknield Street. Between Worcester and Birmingham the current A38 follows the line of a Saxon salt road.

For most of the length of the M5 motorway, the A38 road runs alongside it as a single carriageway road.

==Route description==

===Bodmin to Birmingham===

The road starts on the eastern side of Bodmin at a junction with the A30 before traversing the edge of the town to meet the A30 again. It travels through the picturesque Glynn Valley to Dobwalls and Liskeard, which are bypassed by a dual carriageway. The Dobwalls section contains a bat bridge. The A38 continues through the Cornish countryside, bypassing the centre of Saltash and continuing through the Saltash Tunnel. Immediately after the tunnel the River Tamar is crossed using the Tamar Bridge where the route resumes dual carriageway status. The section from Plymouth to Exeter is known locally as the Devon Expressway; it forms the southern border of Dartmoor National Park, and serves as a southward extension of the M5 motorway opening in 1977. It is long and was completed in the early 1970s. There are several grade separated junctions along its length mainly for local traffic; including a three-level stacked roundabout for the A386, which heads out towards Dartmoor National Park. The route was reserved for the Parkway as early as 1943, when it was included in the Plan for Plymouth.

In the early 1990s, the Marsh Mills junction was significantly remodelled, reducing the size of the roundabout and building a flyover over the top of it, allowing free flowing access from the Plympton bypass onto the Parkway. The viaducts carrying the A38 over the River Plym, which after the construction of the Marsh Mills flyover became the Exeter bound sliproads, were built in 1969–70 as part of the Plympton bypass. They were replaced in the 1990s due to suffering from Alkali Silica Reaction, and the project, completed in February 1996 at a cost of £12.25 million, involved the world&#x27;s largest sideways bridge slide at the time for the , 5,500 tonne bridge. This required the road to be closed for only 48 hours, which won it an AA National Motoring Award in 1996 for innovation and minimisation of traffic congestion.

The road widens to a three-lane dual carriageway for the Plympton bypass. This opened in 1971 and was the first section of the Devon Expressway to be built on a new alignment, as well as being the first sizeable dual carriageway section of the route. Before Ivybridge, the route roughly parallels the original route, bypassing the village of Lee Mill which is now home to a large trading estate. The Ivybridge bypass opened in 1973 and the South Brent bypass in 1974, both on new alignments. The A38 passes Endsleigh Garden Centre, which used to have direct access from the dual carriageway, although since the early 2000s this has been closed and the garden centre is accessed from the Westover junction for Ivybridge. The route originally ended at the Marsh Mills roundabout, which when opened was the largest in Europe.

The section of the A38 between the A382 junction and Ashburton was built on a new alignment parallel to the old road, and was opened in 1974. Trago Mills, a locally well known retailer, is passed by the road. The Ashburton bypass, much like the Kennford bypass, uses the alignment of a much older 1930s single carriageway bypass, which was subsequently upgraded to dual carriageway by 1974. At the town of Buckfastleigh, the route once again bypasses on a new alignment, although due to the challenging topography of the area, the road crosses part of the town on a viaduct. The road occupies part of the alignment of the former Totnes to Ashburton railway line. From Buckfastleigh to the A385 junction, the current road follows the route of original single carriageway, with the majority of this section being upgraded between 1973 and 1974, although a small section at Dean Prior was upgraded between 1966 and 1967. This section is of a poor quality when compared to the majority of the route between Exeter and Plymouth, containing several side turnings with short exit/entry slips, and properties which back onto the road.

The town of Chudleigh and the village of Chudleigh Knighton are bypassed on a new alignment, which opened in 1973, and the following section at Heathfield up to the A382 junction was upgraded from the original route between 1966 and 1968. Some of this section follows part of the old Teign Valley Line railway.

Before Kennford, the route splits, with the A38 heading for Plymouth and the A380 heading towards Torbay. At this point, the road becomes a dual two-lane road although a third-lane emerges immediately for uphill traffic as the route climbs Haldon Hill, which has an average gradient of 1 in 20 over a 4 km distance, and a maximum gradient of around 1 in 10 (the adjacent A380 Telegraph Hill has about the same maximum gradient). The third lane is lost at the top of the hill, and the next section, the Harcombe bends is an original dual carriageway section, older than the rest of the route and this is evident with its sharp bends.

The Devon Expressway ends near the village of Kennford, south of Exeter, at the terminus of the M5. This initial section was opened in 1977, along with the remaining section of the M5, and is a three-lane dual carriageway. The village of Kennford is bypassed, on an alignment of a 1930s bypass, which was upgraded to a dual-carriageway in the 1960s and then widened to a dual three-lane road in 1975.

A junction to the south of Exeter represents a third meeting point of the A38 with the A30, from which point the A38 multiplexes with the M5 before re-emerging from junction 27 near Waterloo Cross, north of Exeter. From junction 27 the A38 heads north via Wellington, Taunton, Bridgwater, Highbridge and Bristol. From Waterloo Cross to Birmingham, the road is paralleled by the M5, where the A38 has reverted to taking local traffic only.

From Bristol, it continues north via Gloucester, Tewkesbury, Worcester and Bromsgrove to Birmingham. Between Worcester and Birmingham the A38 followed the line of an identified Saxon Salt road, one of six leading out of Droitwich. At Bromsgrove, it meets the M42 and the B4096 at junction 1 at Lickey End.
It passes through Upper Catshill and meets the M5 at junction 4 (along with the A491 road) near Lydiate Ash. From here to Edgbaston, the road is mostly dual carriageway, single-lane sections having been replaced in the first decade of the 21st century (see history section, below). Following completion of the Selly Oak bypass, the A38 deviates from its original route and briefly multiplexes with the A4040 outer Ring Road before forming the new bypass which is controversially named New Fosse Way. (The old route is designated B384 having been briefly B38).
In the centre of Birmingham, a section of the road becomes the Aston Expressway A38(M) motorway, running from the north-eastern side of the Inner Ring Road through Aston to the junction with the M6 motorway at Gravelly Hill Interchange, better known as &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;.

The West Midlands section of the A38 is one of the areas chosen by the Highways Agency to monitor the effectiveness of driver location signs in assisting motorists to communicate their location to the emergency services.

===Birmingham to Mansfield===
From Birmingham the road bypasses Sutton Coldfield and Lichfield, before taking up the route of the Roman road, Ryknild Street, (also spelt &quot;Icknield&quot; or &quot;Rykneld&quot;), as far as Derby. At Wychnor, the road crosses the River Trent and enters the district of East Staffordshire. At Barton Turn, near the B5016 junction, the road runs right alongside the Cross Country Route for around . This railway line follows the line of the A38 from Derby to Plymouth. From Alrewas to Burton, the path called The Way for the Millennium follows the northbound carriageway.

From Clay Mills, the road passes through the district of South Derbyshire, passing the grade separated junction with the A5132 for Willington. There is the Derby with Burton services at the Burnaston A50 interchange. The road enters the City of Derby borough north of the Littleover interchange. For nearly , the A38 forms part of Derby&#x27;s outer ring road, including three roundabouts: Kingsway (or &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;) for the A5111; Markeaton for the A52; and Little Eaton (or &quot;Abbey Hill&quot;) for the A61 and B6179. The section of road between Kingsway roundabout to just north of Markeaton is urban in nature and thus subject to a speed limit.

Originally terminating in Derby at the junction of &quot;Babington Lane&quot; with &quot;St Peter&#x27;s Street&quot; (formerly the A6), the road enters the district of Amber Valley where it passes Drum Hill just north of Little Eaton and is crossed at this point by the Midshires Way and Centenary Way. There is a junction for the B6179 to Ripley and Belper. At Alfreton, there is a grade separated junction with the A61, A615 and B6179. The section from Alfreton to the M1, the Alfreton–South Normanton Bypass, opened as the A615 in the late 1960s. This section has a grade separated junction with the B600 for Somercotes and the Cotes Park industrial estate, and where it crosses the Nottingham spur of the Midland Main Line it enters the district of Bolsover.

As a 1970s upgrade to the route of the A61 north of Derby (which became the B6179), the A38 bypasses Ripley passing through former opencast mining land, before joining end-on with the former A615 Alfreton bypass at Watchorn Intersection. The road crosses the M1 at junction 28. Into Nottinghamshire, the road bypasses Sutton-in-Ashfield, dropping to a single carriageway configuration of 1980s construction, including multiple traffic light controlled junctions – such as the Mansfield, Ashfield Regeneration Route (&quot;MARR&quot;). The final section of the A38 from Sutton, past King&#x27;s Mill Hospital into Mansfield, is purely urban in nature and is single carriageway, joining the A6009 in Mansfield Town Centre at the end of the route from Cornwall to the northern Midlands.

==History==
When first designated in 1922, the A38 ran from the centre of Plymouth to Derby. It was later extended west from Plymouth on the former route of the A389 over the Torpoint Ferry to a junction with the A30 at Bodmin. When the Tamar Bridge was opened in 1961, the A38 was rerouted on the former line of the A374, through Tideford, over the new bridge and through Crownhill, joining the old route at Plympton. The old route of the A38, via Torpoint and the centre of Plymouth, was redesignated the A374.

The A38 was extended north from Derby to the M1 motorway and Mansfield in 1977, partly on the former line of the A615.

===Cornwall===

The Liskeard bypass, stretching for from the west of Liskeard to Trerulefoot, opened in June 1976.
A public inquiry was held for the Dobwalls bypass in February 2005, which was expected to cost £32 million. The bottleneck was removed when the bypass, linking the existing Liskeard bypass to the current single carriageway section through the Glynn Valley opened in the Winter of 2008. A campaign to open this road was started by villagers in Dobwalls in 1930, but planning for building the road was not granted until 2006, the work starting on 15 November that year. Two bat bridges and one bat house were added as the road cut through existing bat flight lines. After opening the Dobwall bypass experienced problems with surface water. This led to lane closures in winter due to risk of ice. A major scheme to reconstruct a mile of the bypass started in September 2014 and is expected to last until May 2015. It is thought it will cost an extra £10.6 million.

In a separate improvement within the Glynn Valley, the Highways Agency stabilised a section of the road near Bodmin Parkway railway station. The work, which commenced in October 2007, was carried out to shore up the verge, which had been built on an embankment supported by dry stone walling and the root systems of large trees. It was completed in May 2008 seeing the installation of kerbing, road drainage gulleys, safety barriers as well as increasing the verge width to allow for a new surface water drainage system.

===Devon===

The A38 in Devon runs between Tamar Bridge outside Plymouth and junction 31 of the M5, where the motorway ends; this section is known as the Devon Expressway. It is mainly a two-lane dual carriageway which runs between Exeter and Plymouth serving as a continuation of the M5 motorway. It is a popular route for tourists travelling to Cornwall, though those wanting to use a continuous dual carriageway route to Cornwall can use the A30 rather than using the Devon Expressway before joining the less major roads over the border in Cornwall. It then runs concurrently with the M5 until junction 27, where it splits and enters Somerset independent but parallel to the M5.

During the mid-1960s, small sections of the route between Plymouth and Exeter were upgraded to dual carriageway, such as those at Dean Prior and Heathfield. This was followed by the construction of Plympton bypass in 1970–71, with the majority of realignment, such as the Ivybridge and Buckfastleigh bypasses, being completed during 1973–74. The route, now known as the Devon Expressway, was largely complete by 1975, with the final section between Kennford and the M5 opening in 1977, coinciding with the completion of the final section of the M5 around Exeter during the same year. Whilst many of the sections were newly constructed realignments, some sections such as the Ashburton and Kennford bypasses were upgraded from the original 1930s single carriageway bypasses. The Parkway, the section of dual carriageway through the suburbs of Plymouth between the Tamar Bridge and Marsh Mills, was constructed in 1983–84, along a route which had been reserved for this road since 1943. This was followed by the construction of a flyover over Marsh Mills roundabout in 1992, providing a non-stop route between the Plympton bypass and the Parkway.

The Plympton bypass opened in 1971, and was used for a stage in the 1974 Tour de France, with a stretch closed to traffic in order to allow the visit of the race to the United Kingdom.

The viaducts carrying the A38 over the River Plym, which after the construction of the Marsh Mills flyover became the Exeter bound sliproads, were built in 1969–1970 as part of the Plympton bypass. They were replaced in the 1990s due to suffering from Alkali Silica Reaction, and the project, completed in February 1996 at a cost of £12.25million, involved the world&#x27;s largest sideways bridge slide at the time for the , 5,500 tonne bridge. This required the road to be closed for only 48 hours, winning it an AA National Motoring Award in 1996 for innovation and minimisation of traffic congestion.

As with any major road, accidents are likely to occur; however due to the substandard design of some sections of the route between Exeter and Plymouth, the accident rate has been identified as being above the national average for the type of road. A spate of accidents in April 2009 heightened local awareness of the issue, with local MP Gary Streeter calling for a review of the road. A number of improvements have been made along the route in recent years, mainly being the replacement of worn-out road surfaces, such as those at Buckfastleigh and Ivybridge. These projects have also included the replacement of signage, and the reconstruction of exit/entry slips for side turnings, in a bid to make the road safer.

Presently, the route between Plymouth and the end of M5 is all dual carriageway, and branded the Devon Expressway, being the primary route that links Plymouth to the rest of the country.

Beyond the end of the M5, the road runs concurrently with and as the M5 until junction 27. The original route between Exeter and junction 27 of the M5 (Waterloo Cross) was downgraded to become the B3181 when the M5 was opened in 1977

===Somerset===
From Junction 27 of the M5 to East Brent, the A38 runs broadly parallel to the motorway: junctions 22 to 27 are mostly spurs connecting to the road and all no further than from it. The A38 runs around Wellington, through the county seat of Taunton, North Petherton and Highbridge. Beyond Highbridge and junction 22, the road departs the motorway and resumes primary status, going through Winscombe, Churchill and Lower Langford where it crosses the A368 between Weston-super-Mare and Bath. This route is the suggested route for accessing the south of Bristol and Bristol Airport from the South West.

The centre of Bridgwater was a notorious bottleneck on the &quot;holiday route&quot; as traffic from both the A38 and the A39 had to negotiate through the town centre in order to cross the River Parrett. The construction of a new reinforced concrete road bridge, the Blake Bridge, which opened in March 1958 as part of a southern bypass took much of the traffic away from the centre of Bridgwater. The opening of the M5 in 1974 further reduced the traffic pressure. This is complemented by a link road (Western Way) linking the A38 and the A39 north and west of the town respectively.

Much of the A38 through Somerset was built as single carriageway, with some three-lane passing points. However, the construction of the M5 through Somerset, in the early 1970s, led to the building of links between the A38 and the M5 in the form of new roundabouts on the A38 linking into adjacent junctions on the M5.

===Bristol===
The A38 serves Bristol Airport to the southwest of the city, and enters the city itself at Highridge, along Bedminster Down and into Bedminster. It runs through central Bristol before leaving northwards along North Street, Stokes Croft and Gloucester Road. It runs past the former Filton Airport in South Gloucestershire to meet the M5 again at junction 16. Thereafter it runs through Almondsbury and by-passes Thornbury to enter Gloucestershire.

====South of Bristol====
South of Bristol, the road was diverted in 2001 to cater for an extension of the runway and installation of a category 3 landing system at Bristol Airport. The route south of the city, despite serving the airport, is single-carriageway and suffers from heavy volume of traffic at peak times, and congestion along Bedminster Down. From Bedminster Down the A38 follows West Street and East Street through the centre of Bedminster, but drivers from the south were advised by road signs not to follow the A38 into the city, but to use the A3029 (Winterstoke Road) to enter from the west, as this route had a greater capacity. As part of the &quot;Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study&quot;, a link road had been under consideration to the south of Bristol. This is in part due to the congestion at Winterstoke Road and Barrow Gurney, both of which are very busy, especially the latter where the road can only accommodate travelling at one direction at a given time; and the incomplete Bristol Ring Road (A4174). This road, named the South Bristol Link, was subsequently opened in 2017 and now surpasses the A3029 (Winterstoke Road) as the main route from Bristol Airport to the city centre and the motorway network north of Bristol. 

====Central Bristol====
In central Bristol, the original route from Bedminster Bridge ran up Redcliffe Hill and then along Redcliff Street to Bristol Bridge. In the 1950s Redcliff Street was declassified, following completion of the Inner Circuit Road. The route resumes at The Centre. It then follows Rupert Street to the St James Barton roundabout and Stokes Croft.

====North of Bristol====
The route to the north of the city is also very busy: it runs as a single carriageway up to the junction with the A4174 ring road at Filton, and where it runs as Gloucester Road is a busy shopping parade. Beyond the ring road, it runs as dual-carriageway past Filton Airport which lies in South Gloucestershire, which contains bases for Royal Mail, Airbus, Rolls-Royce and others. Beyond junction 16 of the M5 it runs as a broad single carriageway, again parallel to the M5 in route towards Gloucester.

The present road from Bristol through Horfield was one of the additional roads added to the Bristol turnpike roads in 1749. This passed through Thornbury to Stone, just beyond the boundary of South Gloucestershire, where it met one of the Gloucester turnpike roads. From Almondsbury, the road approximately follows the line of the Roman road from Sea Mills to Gloucester. The previous main route out of Bristol (one of twelve roads from the city, turnpiked in 1727) was Stapleton and Hambrook to the upper end of Tytherington and thence to Stone. This seems to be parts of B4058, B4424, and then unclassified roads. However, Ogilby&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; shows a route following the B4058 as far as Cromhall, then through Stinchcombe Bottom, Dursley, and Cam before joining the present road.

===Gloucestershire===
The Bristol turnpike roads were continued by a turnpike road established in 1727, described as &quot;from the City of Gloucester to the village of Stone being the great road from the north to west of this kingdom&quot;. Much of the road, follows a Roman road, but deviates from it between Buckover and Whitfield.

The A38 was rerouted along the Gloucester Bypass when it was built, and the old route through the city became the A430. In 2007 the Gloucester South Western Bypass opened to traffic, costing £43 million. Though it is numbered A430 and not technically part of the A38, traffic wishing to continue on the A38 on the other side of the city is signed to use the bypass, rather than the existing A38.

Beyond Gloucester, the A38 was probably only improved in 1756 under an Act (29 Geo. 2. c. 58) dealing with roads from that city towards Cheltenham and Tewkesbury. The next section (from Coombe Hill) was improved as one of the Tewkesbury roads, again from 1727. The Act refers to this as the Upper Way to Gloucester in contrast to the Lower Way, which went via Wainsload Bridge. When this Act was renewed in 1756, the road from Tewkesbury to a farmhouse called the Old Blue Ball (now Bluebell Farm) was also included. This was in Earls Croome, Worcestershire, and was where one of the Worcester turnpikes ended. Much of this stretch of the road originated as a Roman road, but the later road left the Roman line near Naunton in Ripple. The name Stratford Bridge on the county boundary confirms its Roman origin there. The A38 into Tewkesbury has been diverted away from the now declassified Gloucester Road along a new link road to the A438 east of the town centre. The A38 resumes in Tewkesbury town centre where the A438 has always met the A38 near the Abbey.

===Worcestershire===
The current A38 road follows from the southern end of one of the Worcester turnpike trust&#x27;s roads which was originally set in 1726, by the Worcester Roads Act 1725 (12 Geo. 1. c. 14), at Severn Stoke, but an act of Parliament of 1737, the Worcester Roads Act 1736 (10 Geo. 2. c. 5), extended it to Upton Bridge (taking it past Bluebell Farm).

North of the city, the road was a particularly important one as it connected the saltmaking centre of Droitwich with the River Severn. In 1706, this was described as heavily used for the &#x27;carriage of salt, iron, coals and other wares&#x27;. The first Turnpike Act for this road was an extremely early one, being passed in 1713 and recites:

When it was renewed by the Worcester to Droitwich Road Act 1725 (12 Geo. 1. c. 20), it was extended from the Tything of Whistons to the Lower Slip of the Quay of Worcester; from Droitwich to Dyers Bridge (M5 Junction 5) near Bromsgrove; and through the town of Droitwich from &quot;Netherwith&quot; [Netherwich] Bridge to a place called &quot;Chapel on the Bridge&quot;. In 1749, this was again extended, by the Worcestershire Roads Act 1748 (22 Geo. 2. c. 43), through the town of Bromsgrove to Spadebourne Bridge, immediately north of the town. Where the road leaves Worcester, it again does not follow the line of the Roman road in the same direction until it picks up the Roman line, just south of Martin Hussingtree. The Roman road took a more direct line over Rainbow Hill and through Blackpole, now B4550. From Martin Hussingtree, the A38 closely follows the Roman line to beyond Bromsgrove. The present road deviates from its line when it was originally classified at Droitwich where the main road is a bypass, the old road now mostly being B4090. This happens again at Bromsgrove, where A38 is again a bypass, the old line mostly now being B4091 and Bromsgrove High Street (now partly pedestrianised, then through the town centre. The Bromsgrove Eastern Bypass was constructed in 1980. 

A short distance north of where the old A38 (now declassified) joins the Bromsgrove bypass, is Lickey End, where an old highway intersection has been replaced by junction 1 of M42 motorway. Here, the road is joined from the southeast by the B4096, Alcester Road, which was from 1754 one of the roads of the Alcester turnpike trust. The continuation northwards of B4096 is called Old Birmingham Road, because it was the original route of the turnpike to Birmingham, climbing to a pass in the Lickey Hills. The Roman road also went through the same pass, but its route to the pass was probably rather straighter. Beyond the motorway junction, the A38 was turnpiked, not as the turnpike to Birmingham, but to Halesowen and Dudley, by the Bromsgrove and Birmingham Roads Act 1726 (13 Geo. 1. c. 15) that also turnpiked Old Birmingham Road. The Worcester and Warwick Roads Act 1741 (15 Geo. 2. c. 7) appointed separate trustees for the Dudley Road in 1742 and the Bromsgrove to Birmingham Roads Act 1747 (21 Geo. 2. c. 22) appointed trustees for the Birmingham Road in 1748. The road continues from the M42 Junction 1 towards Catshill and up a short incline at which there is a fork. Prior to the construction of the M5 motorway in the early 1960s, the Halesowen Road continued West whilst Birmingham Road continued North to meet the existing dual carriageway just South of Rubery. After the M5 was constructed, all traffic was diverted along Halesowen Road (then the A459) which was widened and lit to provide a direct route for the A38 to meet the M5 at Junction 4 at Lydiate Ash, with the dual carriageway continuing North to Rubery. The original Birmingham Road survives to this day, but is noticeably lightly trafficked due to its cul-de-sac nature. Its considerable width makes it a very popular route for learner drivers and as such is affectionately named by local people as &quot;Learners Mile&quot;.

The road from Lydiate Ash to Longbridge was laid out as a new road in the early 1960s to collaborate with the construction of the M5 motorway which opened in 1962. The road passed through the centre of Rubery until the £770,000 (£ in ), Rubery Bypass opened in December 1965.

Lydiate Ash was the northern end of the M5 for many years in the 1960s, with traffic transferring onto the A38, which was diverted at this point to link with the M5.

===Birmingham===

At Longbridge, new turnpike joined the Roman road and the original turnpike, and runs straight towards the city centre. Hutton, the Birmingham historian described the road:
[Birmingham] to Bromsgrove 13 miles [is] made extremely commodious for the first four miles under the patronage of John Kettle esq in 1772 at an expense of £5000, but afterwards is so confined that two horses cannot pass without danger; the sun and winds are excluded, and the rivers lie open to the stranger and he travels through dirt at midsummer. The Northfield bypass, taking traffic away from the congested town centre opened on 11 April 2007. Between Northfield and Selly Oak, the road is likely to have been in use in the medieval period as the road approximately follows the boundary of the former Weoley Park, the great park belonging to Weoley Castle. A dual carriageway bypass () of the narrow section from Selly Oak to Bournbrook opened in August 2011. This required new bridges to carry the Worcester and Birmingham Canal and the Cross-City railway line over the road. The destination of the Roman road was clearly Metchley Fort, but A38 turns away towards the city centre.

After Selly Oak, the A38 takes the Bristol Road into the city as far as the Belgrave Interchange with the A4540 Middleway ring road. The city centre section takes a novel line, laid out as part of extensive reconstruction works in the 1960s, and is one of the few remaining pieces of the original &quot;concrete collar&quot; inner ring road. Thanks to being mostly underground, travelling through an underpass at Holloway Head and the two Queensway tunnels at Paradise Circus and Snow Hill, plus a flyover at Lancaster Circus, the A38 is able to travel straight through the city centre uninterrupted, eventually meeting, at a final underpass beneath Dartmouth Circus, the A38(M) Aston Expressway. The old road took a largely similar line as far as what is now Paradise Circus, before zig-zagging in a less direct and much slower route through the city centre, taking in the north side of New Street Station and then travelling along Corporation street to briefly rejoin its modern alignment.

Between exiting the city centre and the M6 junction 6 (&quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;) at Salford (on the border between Aston and Erdington), the modern route follows the A38(M) Aston Expressway, an unusual seven-lane, single carriageway (and speed limited to ) urban motorway which uses an electronic signage-controlled tidal flow system to provide three lanes each way off-peak, and a 4/2 lane split at peak times (prioritising citybound traffic in the morning, and outbound traffic at night). This merges directly onto the M6 in both directions, as well as the A5127 and A38 surface streets, via an intertwined series of flyovers, meaning there is an uninterrupted run from the motorway and these suburban feeder roads all the way to the southern ring road junction. The original route is now taken by the A5127, starting and terminating at the same points but providing a somewhat slower ride through mixed industrial and residential areas with several roundabout and traffic light controlled at-grade crossings, and since signed and re-engineered with a focus on local access, public transport and non-motorway traffic.

Beyond Salford Circus, the A38 used to pass through Erdington, Wylde Green and particularly Sutton Coldfield town centres (and then Four Oaks, Mere Green and Shenstone) on its way towards Lichfield, before the extensive Sutton Coldfield Bypass was built. This passes far to the east of its namesake town, as well as many other north Birmingham suburbs from Erdington through to Four Oaks, requiring an extensive diversion and use of redesignated link roads to access. The old route between Salford and Lichfield is now the A5127, with the A38 designation being transferred to the Kingsbury/Tyburn Roads (former A4097) at the south end between Aston and the bypass origin at Minworth, and the London Road (former A446) at the north end between its terminus at Bassett&#x27;s Pole and the Lichfield turn, where it (and, via the A5148 link road, the A5127, A5, and now M6 Toll) joins the A38 Lichfield bypass, with the old London road continuing into Lichfield as the A5206. Along the way, it has large roundabout interchanges with the A453 (Sutton-Tamworth, locally) and A5 roads, the latter having been upgraded with a free-flow underpass for the A38 to ease congestion, in concert with the former A5 through Hints being superseded by a dual carriageway bypass starting at the A38.

The bypass is two-lane dual carriageway throughout, offers a speed limit from Salford to Minworth, and is national speed limit ( for light vehicles) for most of the rest of its run. It is not, however, well-grade separated; all junctions as far as Minworth are at-grade, and although most minor local roads pass over or under the rural section without interacting with it at all (or at least are limited to left-in/left-out access only), a new underpass has been built at Weeford, and many gaps have been stopped up, there still remains some flat junctions with major crossroads and right-turn gaps in the central reservation even as far as the Lichfield junction itself (beyond which, the road is of a somewhat higher standard).

In Erdington and Sutton Coldfield, the original A5127 has been bypassed a second time by more minor urban relief roads, easing congestion in and allowing partial pedestrianisation of their respective town centre shopping areas. A further bypass between Sutton centre and the northern junction with the A453 Tamworth Road has long been under consideration to remove pressure from the narrow, mediaeval &quot;high street&quot; section (that features a pair of historic coaching inns and was, originally, part of the A38), but no actual plans have yet been confirmed even after many decades of discussion.

The bypass itself has been partly superseded, initially by the M42 further to the east, and in more recent years by the M6 Toll, which intersects it at junction T3, runs directly alongside part of the former A446 section between Bassett&#x27;s Pole and Weeford Island, where it veers off (and has a further junction, T4) to shadow the A5 instead, also crossing the A5127 (at the limited-access junction T5) a few miles later on. The bypass has been effectively slightly downgraded as a result, first with the at-grade, signalised roundabouts of junction T3 interrupting traffic flow, and soon after by the imposition of a , SPECS-enforced average speed limit (ostensibly because of a substandard alignment – parts of the southbound carriageway were formed directly from the old A446 – and in order to discourage illegal car and motorcycle racing) on the A453-to-A5 section, making the toll road a slightly faster option even during off-peak hours.

Historically, it is not clear which turnpike trust was responsible for the section of road from Birmingham to Lichfield, or even whether it &quot;was&quot; a turnpike. Also, the A5127 out of Sutton picks up the Roman road route a little north of Mere Green (having itself diverted via Metchley Fort, the modern suburbs of Perry Barr and Kingstanding, then Sutton Park and Four Oaks/Little Aston), and follows it to Lichfield. The point south of Lichfield where it interchanges with the A5 (once a staggered junction, altered to a simpler crossroads roundabout by the Wall Bypass, then complicated once more by the coming of the A38/A5148 and M6 Toll) marks the crossing of two Roman streets, with the old A5 continuing to the historic fort of Wall, a mile or so after branching off to the west.

===Staffordshire===
The road (now A5127) from the county boundary at Shenstone Woodend, through Shenstone to Lichfield was one of the roads of the Lichfield Turnpike Trust, established in 1729. However, this section of the old A38 has been replaced by new dual carriageways.

Beyond Lichfield, the old A38 (now A5127) joins the Roman Ryknild Street at Streethay and immediately after that A5127 joins the present A38. Ryknild Street had to that point run roughly parallel to A38, but following a different line from Metchley through Wall, its line sometimes being used by modern roads (including B4138).

The section from Lichfield to Alrewas was dualled in 1958. The £500,000 (£ in ), section from Alrewas to Wychnor Farm near Wychnor Hall, and the £150,000 (£ in ),section from Wychnor Farm to Barton Turn both opened in 1962. The further section of the route was improved to dual carriageway standard, including the £350,000, section from Barton Turn (near Barton-under-Needwood) to Branston in February 1964, bypassing Burton upon Trent in June 1967 (costing £2.6 million (£ in ),), which stretched from Branston to Clay Mills and actually shortened the route – now the A5121 – by ), and in recent years many of the at-grade junctions have been upgraded or stopped-up.

This long stretch of road closely follows Ryknild Street (whose destination was the Roman fort at Little Chester) until just short of Branston where A38 swings west, perhaps to avoid low ground. The Roman road is used by minor roads through the suburbs of Burton upon Trent and then A5121 to rejoin the present A38 beyond the river Dove near Clay Mills. The road from Lichfield to Burton upon Trent was another of the roads maintained by the Lichfield Turnpike Trust from 1729. This diverged from the present line at Branston, taking the road through the town centre, and is now classified as A5121. The road from Burton to Derby was turnpiked in 1753. Beyond the start of the Derby bypass, the old A38 has been reclassified as A5250. This follows Ryknild Street as far as Littleover.

===Derbyshire===
In March 1969, the &#x27;Allestree Link Road&#x27;, from the A6 at Allestree to the former A61 was opened, crossing the River Derwent and Midland Main Line.

Further improvements in the late 1960s and 1970s saw construction of the £5.2 million (£ in ) Mickleover bypass to the south-west of Derby opened on 19 February 1975. Although the government had approved the section through Allestree as early as 1974, before the Mickleover bypass had been completed, this section had many objections from nearby residents, delaying its construction (from the A52 to the A6). It was opposed directly by Derby Borough Council and the former Derby Higher Education College. The £17 million (£ in ) road was eventually opened on 7 September 1983, known as &quot;Queensway&quot;. An extension of the A38 northwards, crossing the M1 at Junction 28, and ending in Mansfield was built. The £3 million (£ in ) Little Eaton-Holbrook Improvement opened on 3 October 1977.

The £12 million (£ in ) Ripley-Swanwick Bypass was opened by Eric Varley (MP for Chesterfield) on 21 October 1977, although the section from Alfreton to the Hartshay Hill roundabout with the A610 had been open to traffic since 5 September 1977.

===Nottinghamshire===
To the east of Junction 28 of the M1, the road used to be the A615 until October 1977. The alignment of this road is relatively modern as the dangerous junction with Berristow Lane was improved to grade-separated in the late 1990s, incorporating access to a busy shopping centre.

<doc id="340086" wikidata="Q1824663" url="?curid=340086" title="M5 motorway">
<text>The M5 is a motorway in England linking the Midlands with the South West. It runs from junction 8 of the M6 at West Bromwich near Birmingham to Exeter in Devon. Heading south-west, the M5 runs east of West Bromwich and west of Birmingham through Sandwell Valley. It continues past Bromsgrove (and from Birmingham and Bromsgrove is part of the Birmingham Motorway Box), Droitwich Spa, Worcester, Tewkesbury, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Bristol, Portishead, Clevedon, Weston-super-Mare, Bridgwater, Taunton, Tiverton, Cullompton terminating at junction 31 for Exeter.
==Route==
The M5 quite closely follows the route of the A38 road. The two deviate slightly around Bristol and the area south of Bristol from junctions 16 to the Sedgemoor services north of junction 22. The A38 goes straight through the centre of Bristol and passes by Bristol Airport, while the M5 skirts both, with access to the airport from junctions 18, 19 or 22. The A38 continues south into Devon from junction 31, near Exminster. 
Junction 15 of the M5 is a large four-level stack interchange, named the Almondsbury Interchange, where the M5 meets the M4. 
The Avonmouth Bridge, between junctions 18 and 19, is often a bottleneck during heavy traffic periods, due mainly to lane drops at either end of the bridge for the respective junctions, and the sharp angle in the centre of the bridge, which causes larger vehicles to slow considerably. There are split-level carriageways where the M5 ascends the hillsides above the Gordano Valley, between Portishead, junction 19 and Clevedon, junction 20.
Between junction 21, Weston-super-Mare and junction 22, Burnham-on-Sea, the M5 passes by an isolated landmark hill called Brent Knoll and crosses the western end of the Mendip Hills. The Willow Man sculpture is visible from both carriageways, and acts as a landmark just to the south of junction 23, which had degraded and lost its head and arms.

==History==

===Construction===
The first of the M5 motorway was constructed as a dual two-lane motorway with Worcestershire County Council acting as engineer. This sectionfrom junction 4 (Lydiate Ash) in the north to a trumpet junction with the M50 in the southopened in July 1962. This original section of the M5, from junctions 4 to 8, was widened to provide six lanes in the early 1990s. During this work, the northbound Strensham services were rebuilt further away from the modified M50 junction.

Worcestershire County Council, the police and particularly the county surveyor of Worcestershire made repeated representations that a dual three-lane standard motorway was appropriate. The Ministry of Transport insisted that a dual two-lane motorway would be built at a cost of around £8million. The Motorways Archive also records that the carriageways were also built to a lower overall width of rather than to reduce the loss of agricultural land. When the decision became necessary to widen the Worcestershire section of M5, it cost £123million.

The dual two-lane section between junctions 16 and 17 built at Filton, near Bristol, was also opened in 1962, and was intended to replace the pre-war Filton bypass. Gloucestershire County Council acted as engineer for this section, which was widened to a dual three-lane motorway in 1969.

North of junction 4 the M5 was constructed in sections, from 1967 to 1970, together with the Frankley services. Much of the northern section beyond junction 3, from about Oldbury to the junction with the M6 motorway, was constructed as an elevated dual three-lane motorway over Birmingham Canal (Old Main Line), Birmingham Canal (New Main Line), and Titford Pool using concrete pillars.

The M5 was also extended southwards, in sections, from 1967 to 1977, through Gloucestershire and Somerset, to Exeter in Devon as a dual three-lane motorway, together with the Strensham services.

The section from Huntworth (J24) to Blackbrook, on the east of Taunton, (J25) was built by A. Monk Ltd, of Padgate, with a contract for £5,721,086 in May 1973 for seven miles. The southbound lane opened on Tuesday 4 November 1975, and the northbound lane opened on Tuesday 25 November 1975. But the motorway section was not legally a motorway for the first few weeks, as it was incomplete. The northbound lane was not fully finished until Easter 1976. Monk Ltd had asked for two extensions to the commercial contract, and some construction subcontractors had entered into liquidation.

The short section between junctions 27 and 29 was built between 1967 and 1969, by Devon County Council, as the &quot;A38 Cullompton Bypass&quot;, with the intention that it should become part of the M5. The termini for this section have since been removed, although part of the southern terminal roundabout is now used as an emergency access. The section was developed to motorway standards, and incorporated into the M5 in 1975.

=== Naming ===
When the initial English motorway system, including the now-M5, was being planned, no numbering system had been agreed. A 1958 Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation memo suggested basing motorway numbers on the existing A road numbering scheme, suggesting that &quot;M5&quot; would be either the section of the London-Doncaster motorway (now the M1) south of Birmingham or the spur from it to Birmingham (now part of the M6), and that the Birmingham to Bristol motorway, now the M5, could be the M38. However, by 1959, the name M5 for the Birmingham to Bristol motorway had been agreed. Rather than take its number from the sector radiating from London, as would be the case for a non-motorway road, it formed (along with the Bristol Channel and the M6) the boundary of a new numbering sector for motorways. 

===Operational history===

Junction 1 surrounds a surviving gatehouse from the former Sandwell Hall. The section from junctions 16 and 18 was illuminated in about 1973 as part of a wider policy announced by Minister for Transport Industries, John Peyton, in 1972 to illuminate the of UK motorway particularly prone to fog.

In the late 1980s, junction 4a was built as part of the M42 motorway construction project. The route of the M42 was decided as early as 1972 but, owing to planning delays, the short section of the M42 north of Bromsgrove did not open until December 1989.

As the M5 traffic increased in the 1980s, junction 11, the main Gloucester and Cheltenham access (via the A40 Golden Valley by-pass) became increasingly congested. At the same time there were plans for large scale business and housing developments at Brockworth, near Gloucester. To relieve junction 11 of some of the new traffic generated, &amp; avoid more congestion around both Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, a new junction, 11A, south of junction 11, was constructed and opened in the mid-1990s. A further feature of this junction was to create a new route from the south west Midlands to London and central southern England via the A417, A419 and the M4 at junction 15. 
The Avonmouth Bridge was converted to eight lanes (four lanes in each direction) in the early 2000s. Later, in 2005–2006, parts of the M5 between junctions 17 and 20 were widened to 7 lanes (four lanes climbing the hills and three lanes descending the hills); variable message signs were added and parts of the central reservation was converted to a concrete step barrier. During this stage of construction the M5 became Britain&#x27;s longest contraflow system,
spanning between junctions 19 and 20. The M5 contraflow was said to be the most complicated ever built in the UK as the motorway is on a split level around the steep hills of the Gordano Valley; meaning four lanes plus an additional emergency vehicle lane were squeezed into that section.
In 2002, extended exits for junction 12 were constructed. The Highways Agency did not anticipate the traffic flows through the junction and the resultant queues soon extended back onto the motorway.

The Cullompton services are signed on the motorway in the northbound direction only. This was implemented to reduce congestion at the low capacity junction, although there is still access available to the services southbound through the junction. Also, the northbound exit slip to the junction was reduced to one lane instead of two to reduce traffic on the small roundabout at the west side of the junction.

In 2009, it was announced that the lighting between junctions 30 and 31 would be turned off between midnight and 05:00 to save energy.

Proposals were announced in September 2009 for a new Gloucester Services between junctions 11a and 12. A planning application was submitted in December 2009. Stroud District councillors approved the services in August 2010. The Services opened in May 2014

In September 2020, Highways England announced that the section between junctions 1 and 2 in the West Midlands will be one of four in England to have its speed limit reduced to in a bid to reduce high levels of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide in the particular area.

==Future developments==
In 2020, it was announced that junction 10 would be undergoing significant roadworks as part of a redevelopment project on the A4019. The works will involve making the interchange full-access and dualling the A4019 east of the junction into Cheltenham. Works will commence in 2023 (subject to permission being granted) and be completed in 2024, according to the Gloucestershire County Council.

There have been suggestions that the Government extend the M5 south, to the city of Plymouth, which currently relies on the A38 road. The argument for such an extension has intensified in light of the closure of Plymouth City Airport in 2011, and the 2014 breaching of the South Devon Railway sea wall following storms that in turn, cut off Plymouth and Cornwall&#x27;s rail access. However this would involve a number of reconstruction works including realignment where the current route of the A38 follows tight bends. 

Improvements to junction 25 at Taunton were approved with an £18million programme that will include the enlargement of the junction roundabout, the widening of the eastern junction slip road exit, and an additional roundabout southeast of the junction to provide access to a new business park and to a proposed bypass of the hamlet of Henlade.

==Incidents and events==

===Discovery of bones===

In October 2009, workmen clearing vegetation from the slip road at junction 14 discovered human bones in a black bin bag dumped in the bushes. The police were called soon after, and it was soon established that the bones were those of a young female. A few days later, DNA found on the remains confirmed that the body was that of Melanie Hall, a Bath hospital worker who disappeared in June 1996 after a night out in Bath, and who had been declared dead in absentia in 2004. Dental records confirmed that the body was hers, and the police began a formal investigation into her murder. As of 2016 no one has been prosecuted in connection with this case. Some keys were also discovered and the police contacted Ford to help them trace the vehicle.

===2011 multi-vehicle collision===

On the evening of Friday 4 November 2011, seven people were killed and a further 51 injured in a major crash involving over 50 vehicles which included cars, vans and large goods vehicles near junction 25 in West Monkton, near Taunton. Several vehicles were burnt out in the fire which developed at the scene as the result of a series of explosions, and the road surface was seriously damaged, not just by the fire and explosions, but also by fuel spillage. The cause of the crash, which took place in wet foggy conditions close to a firework display, was investigated. One person was charged for breach under health and safety laws and found not guilty.

<text>The A34 is a major road in England. It runs from the A33 and M3 at Winchester in Hampshire, to the A6 and A6042 in Salford, close to Manchester City Centre. It forms a large part of the major trunk route from Southampton, via Oxford, to Birmingham, The Potteries and Manchester. For most of its length (together with the A5011 and parts of the A50, and A49), it forms part of the former Winchester–Preston Trunk Road. Improvements to the section of road forming the Newbury Bypass around Newbury were the scene of significant direct action environmental protests in the 1990s. It is 151 miles (243 km) long.

== Route ==

The road is in two sections. The northern section runs south through Manchester and Cheadle, and bypasses Handforth, Wilmslow and Alderley Edge, before passing through Congleton, Newcastle-under-Lyme, and the southern suburbs of Stoke-on-Trent. It then continues south via Stone, Stafford, Cannock and Walsall, passes through the middle of Birmingham (where it briefly merges with the A41), before meeting the M42 motorway at junction 4 south of Solihull.
The northern section of the road in effect combines with the motorway network and then resumes with the southern section.

The southern section begins SSE of the northern section, at junction 9 of the M40 motorway. It continues south as the western part of the Oxford Ring Road, crossing the River Thames on the A34 Road Bridge. It then bypasses Abingdon, Didcot, and Newbury before finishing at junction 9 of the M3 motorway. This part of the A34 forms the E05 European route. It is a dual carriageway throughout.

Together with parts of the M3 and the M40, the A34 forms an important route carrying freight from Southampton to the Midlands. Because of the volume of traffic, bypasses were built along this route – at Newbury on the A34, and at Twyford Down near Winchester on the M3 – but these were controversial for environmental reasons. Notably instead of cutting a short road tunnel through Twyford Down, the escarpment was carved out for the road traffic of the motorway, though the route of the old A33 closed as a result.

In 2004, the junction with the M4 motorway was re-engineered from a roundabout to free-flowing grade separated junction.
===Future===
The idea that the cancelled Oxford–Cambridge Expressway (linking the current A34 near Oxford to the A14 near Cambridge) would have been designated as A34, did not have any official status.

== History and renumbering ==


The original (1922) route of the A34 was Winchester to Oxford, much shorter than it is today. It was extended to Manchester on 1 April 1935, replacing part of the A42 (Oxford to Birmingham through Shipston-on-Stour, Stratford-upon-Avon and Henley-in-Arden), A455 (Birmingham to Stafford), part of the A449 (Stafford to Newcastle-under-Lyme) and A526 (Newcastle to Manchester).

By 1953 the route was as follows:

When the Oxford Ring Road was completed to the west of Oxford in 1962, the old route through the city was renumbered the A4144. On completion of the Abingdon Bypass in the 1970s, the old route from the Oxford Ring Road through Abingdon and Steventon to Chilton was partly declassified (for ) and the rest renumbered A4183, B4017, A4130 and A4185.

In 1987, the A34 between Walsall and Bloxwich swapped routes with the parallel B4210.

In 1991, shortly after the completion of the M40 motorway, the road between Oxford and Solihull was renumbered. Between Chipping Norton and Solihull the road lost its primary route status and was renumbered A3400, and south of Chipping Norton the route became part of an extended A44. The A34 was diverted north from the Oxford Ring Road to the M40 along parts of the former routes of the A43 (which had originally followed the route of the present B430) and A421. Much of the long-distance traffic formerly carried by the present A3400 now uses the M40 to Birmingham, and the M42 and M6 to by-pass the city.

When the Newbury Bypass was opened in 1998, the old route through Newbury became part of the A339 and the B4640.

The long planned and often postponed Alderley Edge bypass was completed in November 2010, ahead of schedule and within the £52 million budget. The official opening ceremony was conducted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, on 19 November 2010.

<doc id="340091" wikidata="Q1881080" url="?curid=340091" title="M8 motorway (Scotland)">
<text>The M8 is the busiest motorway in Scotland. It connects the country&#x27;s two largest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, and serves other large communities including Airdrie, Coatbridge, Greenock, Livingston and Paisley. The motorway is long. A major construction project to build the final section between Newhouse and Baillieston was completed on 30 April 2017. The motorway has one service station, Heart of Scotland Services, previously named Harthill due to its proximity to the village.

==History==
With the advent of motorway-building in the United Kingdom in the late 1950s, the M8 was planned as one of a core of new motorways, designed to replace the A8 road as a high-capacity alternative for intercity travel. The motorway was constructed piecemeal in several stages bypassing towns, beginning in 1965 with the opening by Minister of State for Scotland George Willis of the bypass of Harthill. In 1968 the Renfrew Bypass was opened as the A8(M), becoming part of the M8 when the motorway to the west was connected. The Glasgow inner city section was constructed between 1968 and 1972, using a scheme outlined in the Bruce Report, which was published as the Second World War was closing, and which set out a series of initiatives to regenerate the city. Bruce&#x27;s scheme evolved into what would become the Glasgow Inner Ring Road, a motorway &quot;box&quot; which would encircle the city centre, connected to the Renfrew Bypass at its south western corner, and the Monkland Motorway (built over the former route of the Monkland Canal) towards Edinburgh at its north eastern corner. Together, these three sections of motorway make up the present day M8.

Most of the motorway&#x27;s length was complete by 1980. Since then, there has been a new interchange with the M80 motorway added in 1992, a eastern extension from Newbridge to the then-new Edinburgh City Bypass in 1995, and the new junction on the approach to the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow connecting to the new M74 extension in 2011. As part of the Scottish Government&#x27;s &#x27;M8 M73 M74 Motorway Improvements programme&#x27;, on which construction began in early 2015, the remaining unfinished section between Baillieston (J8) and Newhouse (J6) was built, alongside other major improvements enhancing connectivity to the local road network, M73, and M74. The new section was fully opened on 30 April 2017. On 6 December 2019, the Southbar interchange (J29a) was reopened to facilitate regeneration in the Bishopton area, having been previously closed during the 1970s.

==Route==
From the Edinburgh City Bypass, the road runs west to junction with the M9 motorway (for the Forth Road Bridge), bypassing to the north of Livingston and south of Bathgate. It continues across Scotland&#x27;s Central Belt. The next section – originally designated the Monkland Motorway – begins on the boundary of the Glasgow City council area at the M73 motorway junction (the main interchange for all routes south via the M74 motorway) before passing through the districts of Barlanark, Riddrie, Dennistoun and Townhead (following the route of the abandoned Monkland Canal) on the way directly into the city centre. The central section – the uncompleted Glasgow Inner Ring Road – contains numerous junctions serving local communities including Cowcaddens, Garnethill, Kelvingrove and Anderston. It then crosses the River Clyde on the Kingston Bridge, runs west through Kinning Park, Bellahouston and Hillington before leaving Glasgow. Continuing west, it bypasses Renfrew and Paisley (carrying traffic directly over what was the main runway at Renfrew Airport, closed in 1966) before serving Glasgow International Airport, running to the south of Erskine, and terminating at Langbank, around east of Greenock.

The M8 nominally comprises sections of the international E-road network, namely E05 (Langbank-Baillieston) and E16 (Baillieston-Edinburgh), although neither is signposted – no such roads are in the United Kingdom.

==Criticism==
The central Glasgow section of the M8 is unusual amongst UK motorways (and more similar to many US Interstates) in that it directly bisects an urban city centre, whereas most other motorways bypass such centres. This section is mainly elevated on a concrete viaduct, lowering pollution concentrations but exposing some public spaces, roof terraces and other parts of buildings to noise and shading.

Some slip roads in the Glasgow section unusually enter and exit from the overtaking (right-hand) lane.

The motorway includes one of the busiest river crossings in Europe, Glasgow&#x27;s Kingston Bridge.

Several incomplete structures were built around the motorway - at least 3 have been demolished or reused from the 1960s dubbed Bridges to Nowhere. A few incomplete structures remain.

The cause of most traffic congestion on the urban section is traffic from the M73 and M80 routes onto the eastern section of M8 which within reduces from five lanes to two on the Kingston Bridge approaches. Prior to the construction of the M74 extension, attempts were made to minimise delays on this section; these included restricting exits around the Kingston Bridge, a ramp metering programme, and expanded use of electronic signing above and beside the motorway as part of the CITRAC (&quot;Centrally Integrated TRAffic Control&quot;) system.

The M8 is also criticised as a barrier to wildlife access (for example the reintroduced beaver) from the north of Scotland to the Southern Uplands.

==Problems solved==
Successive failed attempts were made to build the southern flank of the Glasgow Inner Ring Road envisaged by the Bruce Report of the late 1940s. The eastern section had been planned to run north/south close to the High Street of Glasgow, through or under Glasgow Green to the southside of the Clyde. Public opinion was strongly against this and the eastern section was shelved, with a much later M74 connecting the far-eastern areas of Glasgow. This section, which is an extension of the M74 was built to a different route, intended to funnel long-distance traffic from the north and south which is bound for the southern Clyde Coast and allow it to bypass the urban section of the M8. Following many years of intensive political discussion and legal battles, the M74 completion began in 2008 and opened in June 2011. Indications are that the new road has been successful in reducing traffic levels on the urban section of the M8.

<text>The A44 is a major road in the United Kingdom that runs from Oxford in southern England to Aberystwyth in west Wales.

==History==
The original (1923) route of the A44 was Chipping Norton to Aberystwyth. No changes were made to the route of the A44 in the early years. After the Second World War, the section between Rhayader and Llangurig was renumbered A470, as part of the long road in Wales that connects Cardiff on the south coast to Llandudno on the north coast. The A44 was extended to Oxford in the 1990s, replacing part of the A34 when the M40 motorway was completed.

==Route==

===Oxford–Evesham===

The road begins at a roundabout junction with the A40 road on the northern section of Oxford&#x27;s ring road in Oxfordshire. It has a grade separated junction with the A34 road (leading to the M40 motorway and Winchester). From here, the road runs northwest, and has a section of dual-carriageway through the villages of Yarnton and Begbroke before reaching the town of Woodstock, home to Blenheim Palace. The road then reaches the main market street in Chipping Norton before entering the Cotswolds. The road here has many hills and turns, and is single-carriageway with some tight bends, with not much opportunity for overtaking.

The road then enters Gloucestershire, and the town of Moreton in Marsh, before sweeping up through woodland until it reaches Fish Hill near Broadway in Worcestershire. At this point, it becomes 3-lane and descends steeply through some sharp bends. It then bypasses Broadway before meeting up with the A46/A435 Evesham bypass.

===Evesham–Leominster===

On reaching the northern end of the Evesham bypass the A44 heads northwest, passing Wyre Piddle and the town of Pershore before reaching the crossroads near Spetchley. The road then crosses the M5 motorway and onto Worcester&#x27;s eastern bypass (A4440). It then turns south along the bypass before rejoining its original line west into the city itself. The road passes the Cathedral, crosses the River Severn and then meets the western end of the bypass.

After leaving Worcester, the A44 continues west past the village of Broadwas, following the River Teme until Knightwick where enters Herefordshire as it climbs over Bringsty Common before descending towards Bromyard. The A44 bypasses Bromyard town centre and heads west over the downs to Bredenbury. It then crosses the River Lugg before meeting the A49 Leominster bypass, where it turns left and heads through the town centre.

===Leominster–Rhayader===
After leaving Leominster, the A44 crosses the River Arrow to bypass Monkland. The road then heads towards the black and white villages of Eardisland and Pembridge. After Pembridge the A44 meanders west, passing numerous orchards en route, before reaching Lyonshall, where the road meets the A480 and passes Offa&#x27;s Dyke. A couple of miles later and the A44 meets Kington. The road bypasses the town and follows the River Arrow before reaching the Welsh border. 

Leaving Herefordshire and entering Powys, the road continues through Walton and passes the village of New Radnor, before turning south to Llanfihangel Nant Melan. The road then turns northwest to do some serious hill-climbing before winding its way downhill to a plateau. A few miles later it reaches Penybont and Crossgates, where it meets the A483 road. Eight miles further the A44 reaches Rhayader.

A spoof sign on this section of the road, announcing &quot;Llandegley International Airport 2½ &quot;, has attracted international press coverage and been mentioned in Parliament.

===Rhayader–Aberystwyth===

On reaching the centre of Rhayader, traffic heads to the left of the clock tower before immediately turning right, where the road passes through the town and joins the A470 for to Llangurig, following the course of the River Wye. Leaving Llangurig, the road starts clinging to hillsides as it winds its way through the Cambrian Mountains.

The road enters Ceredigion and the next hamlet is Eisteddfa Gurig which, at 1339 feet (408 metres) above sea level, is its highest point and the location of the iconic Elvis Rock. The A44 then descends into the remote settlement of Ponterwyd. The road passes several abandoned mines en route to the villages of Goginan and Capel Bangor, where it meets the River Rheidol. The road then passes the village of Llanbadarn Fawr, continuing for the last mile through the outskirts of Aberystwyth before terminating on the A487 at Penglais Hill.

==Former routes==

===Bypasses and realignments===
* Evesham: the route used to go through the centre of the town, but now runs to the north.
* Evesham–Worcester: the route used to run on a road to the south. The old route is now known as the B4084.
* Leominster–Kington: for west of Barons&#x27; Cross the road formerly followed a more northerly route, crossing the River Arrow at Eardisland.
* Kington, Herefordshire, the road bypasses the centre of the town using the former Leominster and Kington Railway trackbed north of the town.
* Wyre Piddle. In 2003 the A44 was rerouted down the A4538 between Evesham and Worcester and therefore no longer goes down Pershore High Street.

<text>The estimated time of arrival (ETA) is the time when a ship, vehicle, aircraft, cargo, person, or emergency service is expected to arrive at a certain place.

==Overview==
One of the more common uses of the phrase is in public transportation where the movements of trains, buses, airplanes and the like can be used to generate estimated times of arrival depending on either a static timetable or through measurements on traffic intensity. In this respect, the phrase or its abbreviation is often paired with its complement, estimated time of departure (ETD), to indicate the expected start time of a particular journey. This information is often conveyed to a passenger information system as part of the core functionality of intelligent transportation systems.

For example, a certain flight may have a calculated ETA based on the speed by which it has covered the distance traveled so far. The remaining distance is divided by the speed previously measured to roughly estimate the arrival time. This particular method does not take into account any unexpected events (such as new wind directions) which may occur on the way to the flight&#x27;s destination.

ETA is also used metaphorically in situations where nothing actually moves physically, as in describing the time estimated for a certain task to complete (e.g. work undertaken by an individual; a computation undertaken by a computer program; or a process undertaken by an organization). The associated term is &quot;estimated time of accomplishment&quot;, which may be a backronym.

==Applications==
Accurate and timely estimations of times of arrival are important in several application areas:
*In air traffic control arrival sequencing and scheduling, where scheduling aircraft arrival according to the first-come-first-served order of ETA at the runway minimizes delays.
*In airport gate assignment methods, to optimize gate utilization.
*In elevator control, to minimize the average waiting time or journey time of passengers (destination dispatch).

<text>The A57 is a major road in England. It runs east from Liverpool to Lincoln via Warrington, Salford and Manchester, and then through the Pennines over the Snake Pass (between the high moorlands of Bleaklow and Kinder Scout), around the Ladybower Reservoir, through Sheffield and past Worksop. Between Liverpool and Glossop, the road has largely been superseded by the M62, M602 and M67 motorways. Within Manchester a short stretch becomes the Mancunian Way, designated A57(M).

==Route==

===Liverpool–Warrington===
The A57 begins at The Strand (A5036) near the River Mersey, as part of Water Street. It forms an east–west route through the north of the city centre with another one-way road system as Tithebarn Street (passing part of Liverpool John Moores University), Great Crosshall Street and Churchill Way in the east direction and Churchill Way and Dale Street in the west direction. The connecting roads Moorfields and Hatton Garden are also part of the A57, which join the east and west directions. In both directions, Churchill Way crosses the A59 near the entrance of the Queensway Tunnel. It overlaps briefly with the A580 as Islington, separated as two one-way roads, then becomes Prescot Street, passing the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. At the junction with the B5340, it becomes Kensington, meeting the A5089 to the south and B5188 to the north, becoming Prescot Road. It crosses a railway at Fairfield passing St Anne&#x27;s Church on the left, overlapping with the B5189 Green Lane to the north. It meets the A5047 to the south near a Tesco and the B5189 at Old Swan. At the junction with the A5058 Queens Drive it enters Knotty Ash (with Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital to the north), becoming East Prescot Road and a trunk road. There is a roundabout and it enters Dovecot before it passes through Huyton. It meets the A526 Seth Powell Way to the north (for the M57), becoming Liverpool Road, At junction two of the M57, it meets the B5194 Knowsley Lane to the north and B5199 Huyton Lane to the south, and the start of the A58. It passes through Prescot as the non-trunk Derby Street then High Street. It meets the A58 again and becomes a trunk road, then meets the B5200 (former route of the A57) at a roundabout, becoming Warrington Road. It crosses the Liverpool to Wigan Line near Scotchbarn Leisure Centre. It meets the B5201 to the north opposite Whiston Hospital. It passes through Rainhill, meeting the B5413 near the railway station. It passes Rainhill High School to the left, then St Bartholomew RC Primary School. At junction 7 of the M62, it meets the A557 (for Widnes) and the St Helens Linkway A570 (for St Helens). The road runs along the road from junction 7 for about , then it meets the B5419 at a crossroads, and the A569 to the left at Bold Heath near the Griffin Inn. At Lingley Green it enters as Liverpool Road, passing the Trigger Pond pub on the left. It crosses the Liverpool to Manchester Line (southern route). At Great Sankey, it becomes a dual-carriageway and meets the A562 at a roundabout.

===Warrington–Manchester===

The original route through Warrington town centre included the narrow Sankey Street, which required special narrow buses to be operated. The road now bypasses Warrington town centre via a new elevated road, Midland Way, before emerging at a roundabout junction with the A49. The road loses its trunk road status and becomes School Brow. Warrington Parish Church, St Elphin, is to the right, near the right turn for Church Street. The road becomes Manchester Road, and meets the A50 at crossroads. It passes through Bruche, home of a former police training centre, and its running track. At Paddington, the road becomes dual-carriageway as New Manchester Road, passing close to Woolston Community High School. In Woolston, it becomes Manchester Road. It passes a speed camera near Woolston Leisure Centre and enters Martinscroft. At junction 21 of the M6, it becomes a trunk road and meets the B5210 Woolston Grange Avenue at a roundabout, then passes the Mascrat Manor at another roundabout. It traverses Rixton Moss, passing Ramswood Nurseries. It passes briefly through Rixton, with a right turn for Warburton over the Warburton toll bridge, and becomes dual-carriageway at Hollins Green. At the end of the dual-carriageway is a left turn for the B5212 for Glazebrook and its railway station, and then it crosses Glaze Brook] as Liverpool Road, entering the metropolitan district of Salford.
There is a new roundabout with the former road through Cadishead, and a new section of the A57 follows the Manchester Ship Canal, on the route of the MSC Railway. The former route is partly the B5417 (and the B5320 is an earlier route), continuing as Liverpool Road. The £11.3 million Cadishead Way opened on 16 September 2005. It meets the B5417 at a roundabout near Northbank Industrial Estate. It passes under the railway near the junction of the River Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal, and there is a left turn for the B5311. There is a new roundabout next to Irlam Locks and the Boat House pub and another with the B5320 at the end of the Cadishead Way, which bypasses Irlam. Entering Eccles as Liverpool Road, it passes Boysnope Park Golf Club on Barton Moss, where the road becomes dual-carriageway. It passes the City Airport Manchester on the left (AKA Barton Aerodrome before March 2007). At Peel Green, it meets the M60 at junction 11, with the Barton High Level Bridge and Barton-upon-Irwell close by to the south.
Soon after this junction the road enters Patricroft and is no longer a trunk road, passing the Unicorn pub. It meets the B5211 at crossroads (Patricroft Bridge) and crosses the Bridgewater Canal, then there is a left turn for the B5231 (Green Lane) towards Patricroft railway station and Monton. Before long it enters the centre of Eccles proper, splitting into two as Church Street and Irwell Place going east, passing the library and a Morrisons, and Corporation Road going west. It meets a roundabout near the Eccles terminus of the Manchester Metrolink. It becomes the dual-carriageway Bentcliffe Way, meeting the A576 (for Trafford Park. It leaves the A576 near junction 2 of the M602, heading east as the single-carriageway Eccles New Road. It passes the Ladywell tram stop on the right and meets the A5185 to the left. The Metrolink follows the road on the right hand side. There is the B5228 to the left near the Weaste station. In Weaste, there is the Langworthy tram stop near the A5186 left turn where the Metrolink leaves the road to the south. The road runs parallel to the M602 100m to the north.
The road becomes the trunk road dual carriageway Regent Road at the junction with the terminus of the M602 and the A5063 (Albion Way north for the A6, and Trafford Road south for Salford Quays). It is now the main route into Manchester from the west, meeting the A5066 at crossroads, passes a Sainsbury&#x27;s on the left, then meets the B5461 and crosses the River Irwell where it enters the city of Manchester. There is a left turn for the A6143 Water Street (for Castlefield) and it becomes Dawson Street, is crossed by the Metrolink (for Altrincham), passes over the Bridgewater Canal and Cheshire Ring, then becomes Egerton Street. It runs into the A57(M) – the Mancunian Way at the GSJ with the A56 Bridgewater Way. The Beetham Tower Manchester is seen nearby to the left.

===Manchester–Sheffield===

It leaves the A57(M) at the A6 exit and follows Downing Street, and Ardwick Green South, passing through Brunswick and the Ardwick Green Barracks of the King&#x27;s and Cheshire Regiment. The A6 leaves at a roundabout, and the road temporarily loses its trunk status. At the Ellen Wilkinson High School, it meets the A665, and becomes a trunk road as Hyde Road. It crosses under a railway and meets the A6010 at crossroads. It passes through Belle Vue, meets the B6178 (for Levenshulme), crosses a railway near the Belle Vue railway station, entering Gorton. It meets the B6167 (for North Reddish). It enters the borough of Tameside, becoming the dual-carriageway Manchester Road.

It meets the M60 at junction 24, and divides into two east and west routes next to Denton railway station on the left and a Sainsbury&#x27;s on the right, either side of the M67. They meet and the road loses its trunk status, entering Denton, passing the Christ Church Denton] on the right. It meets the A6017 at crossroads, becoming Hyde Road with a Morrisons on the right. It meets junction 2 of the M67, which follows the road, near the church of St Anne and crosses the River Tame, becoming Manchester Road. It crosses the Peak Forest Canal and goes under the Hope Valley Line near Hyde Central railway station. The A627 overlaps and there it meets junction 3 of the M67 with an Asda on the right as it passes through Hyde as Market Street and Union Street and passes Tameside College on the right. It leaves the A627 to the right as Mottram Road, with a Morrisons on the left next to the M67, entering Godley and passing under the Glossop Line near Godley railway station and Godley Reservoir. It passes through Hattersley, and mets the final junction of the M67 – junction 4 – at a roundabout with the dual-carriageway A560 (for Stockport).
It resumes its trunk road status as Hyde Road, passing through Mottram in Longdendale, where there are crossroads at traffic lights with the B6174. Leaving Mottram, it meets the A6018 to the left (from Stalybridge) at traffic lights. It becomes Mottram Moor and at the next junction, it leaves to the right, with the A628 continuing straight on. It loses trunk road status and becomes Woolley Lane, passing through part of Hollingworth. It crosses the River Etherow, entering Derbyshire and the High Peak district. It enters Brookfield and meets the A626 (for Marple) from the right. It passes under the Glossop Line, at the Dinting viaduct, again near Dinting railway station as it passes through Dinting and the primary school. The A6016 leaves to the right and the road enters Glossop as High Street West passing a Tesco on the left. It meets the A624 (for Hayfield) and the B6105 at crossroads in the middle of the town, near Norfolk Square and the railway station. It becomes High Street East, passing Glossop Leisure Centre on the right. There is a roundabout and it becomes Sheffield Road, then Woodcock Road as it leaves Glossop and enters the Peak District National Park (Dark Peak). There is a sharp bend to the right and it becomes Snake Pass.

It climbs up Holden Clough and at Featherbed Moss, it is crossed by the Pennine Way at the summit at 1550 ft, with the hills of Bleaklow to the left and Kinder Scout to the right. Here it enters the National Trust&#x27;s High Peak Estate. It passes the Doctor&#x27;s Gate and follows the Lady Clough valley downhill to a point where Lady Clough meets the River Ashop, passing the Snake Pass Inn on the left. It follows the River Ashop closely to the north in the Woodlands Valley for about , and leaves the High Peak Estate. It crosses the River Alport. It crosses Ladybower Reservoir at Ashopton Bridge. It meets the A6013 (for Bamford) and passes the Ladybower Inn. It climbs the valley and passes over Cutthroat Bridge. It is at about 1200 ft as it enters South Yorkshire and the city of Sheffield. It follows down the hill as Manchester Road past Hollow Meadows.
Following the hill down into Sheffield, it passes the New Norfolk Arms on the left, with the Rivelin Dams on the right with the Rivelin Rocks high on the left, and leaves the Peak District National Park. At the Rivelin Mill Bridge it crosses the River Rivelin and the A6101 leaves to the left. It passes the Bell Hagg Inn on the left, then the Sportsman in Crosspool. It enters Tapton Hill and passes the Lydgate Junior School and Tapton School. It meets Fulwood Road in Broomhill. The B6069 leaves to the right, and it becomes Whitham Road.

It passes Weston Park Hospital and as Western Bank, it passes Sheffield Children&#x27;s Hospital then the Octagon Centre on the right and becomes the dual-carriageway Brook Hill, passing straight through the University of Sheffield with its Arts Tower and Alfred Denny Building seen to the left, and the Hicks Building seen to the right. It becomes Broad Lane in Netherthorpe, passing the former Jessop Hospital and then St George&#x27;s Church in Portobello (now part of Sheffield University). At a roundabout it passes the City Plaza, becoming Tenter Street then Westbar Green. It becomes West Bar, passing the Law Courts on the left, then the police headquarters and former Castle Market on the right as Bridge Street. It passes close to the River Don on Castlegate, becoming Exchange Place. It becomes the Sheffield Parkway (built in 1974), Sheffield&#x27;s main route to the M1, meeting a roundabout.

===Sheffield–Worksop===

It meets the A6102 at a GSJ, near the Sheffield Park Academy. At Bowden Housteads Woods, it leaves to the right at a GSJ, passing Athelstan Primary School becoming single-carriageway (three lanes). It passes the City School in Richmond and meets the B6064 at a roundabout, being followed by the Trans Pennine Trail. It passes Hackenthorpe and meets the B6053 (for Crystal Peaks) at a roundabout, becoming a short section of dual-carriageway until another nearby roundabout at Beighton. It crosses the River Rother, entering the borough of Rotherham, and meets a roundabout.
It crosses the Sheffield to Lincoln Line and at the roundabout at Swallownest with the former route (B6200) turns right onto Aston Way. At Aston, it meets the A618 from the left, then the A618 leaves to the right at the next roundabout. The Aston Relief Road ends where it meets the M1 at junction 31, just after the junction for the former route (B6067). It becomes the dual-carriageway Worksop Road, and now the level of traffic increases as it is a major east–west route. It becomes single-carriageway and meets the B6463 from the left, near Todwick and Red Lion Inn. At South Anston, it meets the B6059 at the Shell Worksop Road station. It crosses a railway and Lindrick Common near Woodsetts.

===Worksop–Lincoln===

The £11.3 million Worksop Southern Bypass opened in May 1986. It starts at the roundabout with the B6041 (for Gateford and the former route through Worksop). The next short section is dual-carriageway to the Shireoaks roundabout, which also has access to the Gateford and Dukeries industrial estates. It becomes single-carriageway and crosses the Sheffield to Lincoln Line, at the junction with the Robin Hood Line, and over the Chesterfield Canal. It meets the A60 (for Worksop) at the Rhodesia Roundabout, near Rhodesia, a Sainsbury&#x27;s and a McDonald&#x27;s. The next short section, overlapping with the A60 and crossing the River Ryton, is dual-carriageway to the roundabout with the A60 (for Mansfield) and B6024, near the Shell Dukeries Garage and the Worksop Little Chef. From here, it is single carriageway (excluding the A1 section). There is a roundabout with the B6034 (for Ollerton) near Worksop College and Portland School.
It passes the former site of Manton Colliery, and a large B&amp;Q depot on the left. There is a roundabout with the B6040 (former route through Worksop), which has access to Manton Wood Enterprise Zone. It passes a large Wilkos depot on the left and goes through Clumber Park. It meets the A1 at the Apleyhead Junction, with the A614, also known as Five Lanes End. The former roundabout was grade-separated in November 2007. Via the A1, it passes Elkesley (on the former route) with two 50 mph speed cameras and the Retford Gamston Airport, where it crosses the River Idle. Prior to the A1(M) Doncaster bypass opening in August 1961, this section of the road was the A57 – the A1 (now A638) went straight through Retford. Near to West Drayton it crosses the River Maun; this section shared with the A1 was dualled in the late 1950s, and the West Drayton Diversion was a completely new section, with the bridge over the Maun and Markham Moor roundabout, and opened in February 1957. At the next roundabout with the A638 (for Retford) and B1164 (for West Markham) at Markham Moor (again being grade-separated) there is the Markham Hotel and two Little Chefs, including one (originally a petrol station) designed by Sam Scorer with a hyperbolic paraboloid-shaped roof that was threatened with demolition but was listed by the Department for Culture Media and Sport in 2012. The Markham Hotel is currently situated on the former pre-1957 route, 330 yards to the north, and there are two large Markham Moor Shell stations. It leaves up the steep Cliff Gate to the left, which now has a crawler lane over Beacon Hill. It bypasses East Markham (on the former route to the south), and crosses the East Coast Main Line. 550 yards east of the village it resumes its former route. It meets the A6075 (for Tuxford and Ollerton) from the right west of Darlton where it passes St Giles&#x27; Church. There are turns for East Drayton to the left and Ragnall on the right, and the power stations of Cottam and (former) High Marnham are to the north and south, with many lines of pylons following the Trent.
It goes through Dunham on Trent, where it passes the White Swan, Bridge Inn and St Oswald&#x27;s Church; the width of road through the village is not suited for the volume of traffic. It crosses the River Trent at Dunham Bridge (toll, rebuilt in the mid-1970s), entering Lincolnshire and the district of West Lindsey as Dunham Road. The Trent Valley Way joins at Dunham and leaves to the south at the other end of the bridge. It meets the A1133 (for Gainsborough) at a staggered junction at Newton on Trent; the former route of both routed went through the village along High Street – 330 yards east of the junction it resumes the former route (Southmoor Road further to the south). On entering the parish (but not the village) of Kettlethorpe the road formerly followed the turn for Thorney (in Nottinghamshire) to the right, and then further to the south, with the new section of road resuming the old route close where it crosses Darnsdyke. The road follows the boundary of Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire for about , and this section of Lincolnshire encloses former parishes in Nottinghamshire. The Fossdyke Navigation runs alongside from the junction with the A156; the road becomes Gainsborough Road passing Drinsey Nook, with the A156 taking priority from the left (north) at the traffic-light-controlled junction. On the bend at Drinsey Nook, the road briefly re-enters Nottinghamshire – the Fossdyke is the boundary. At the junction with the B1190 at Tom Otter&#x27;s Bridge, the boundary follows the B1190 to the south, along Ox Pasture Drain. It approaches Saxilby and crosses the Sheffield to Lincoln Line and Fossdyke, meeting the B1241, for Sturton by Stow.
It crosses the River Till as Lincoln Road; a former section of the road from here passed closer to Odder Farm to the north. There is a roundabout, where the road rejoins the old route, for Burton, and Burton Waters marina, then the road enters the borough of Lincoln at the bend in the road to the left before Bishop Bridge (over Catchwater Drain and Main Drain) and meets the A46 Lincoln Bypass at a roundabout. It enters Lincoln as Carholme Road passing the Total Winning Post Service Station, with Carholme Golf Club to the right, then meets the B1273 Lincoln inner ring road, becoming Newland, where it passes the offices of Lincolnshire County Council on the left. It follows the dual-carriageway Wigford Way next to Brayford Pool and the University of Lincoln, over the River Witham, where it meets the B1262 High Street. It becomes St Mary&#x27;s Street and passes the railway station on the right. It splits into Oxford Street, Pelham Street and Norman Street where it meets the A15 at Pelham Bridge, close to the large Siemens engineering company.

Although the terminus of the road is in Lincoln, most of the A57 follows the former Liverpool-Skegness trunk road, created by the 1946 Trunk Roads Act. The road from Lincoln to Skegness was formerly also known as the A158.

==History==
===1979 - Snake Pass potential closure===
In 1979, the Department for Transport considered closing the Snake Pass section with traffic to be diverted to use the A628. 

===1985 - Opening of Aston relief road===
The £4 million Aston relief road in Sheffield opened in mid-1985, with the old route now designated as the B6200.

===2017 - Transpennine road upgrade===
In 2017, Highways England announced a consultation for upgrades to road in the Transpennines. This includes: 
*Upgrades to the Westwood roundabout near Sheffield; packaged with technology improvements along the A628, A616 and A61, including electronic signs and improved closure gates
*Creation of two new link roads at the western end of the A57/A628 route, to provide a dual carriageway bypass around Mottram in Longdendale

<text>The A90 road is a major north-to-south road in eastern Scotland, running from Edinburgh to Fraserburgh, through Dundee and Aberdeen. Along with the A9 and the A82 it is one of the three major north–south trunk roads connecting the Central Belt to northern destinations. The A90 is not continuous: there is a gap between Dalmeny and Perth, but the M90 connects those two places.

==Background==
The creation and development of the A90 road has to be understood in terms of the development of the economy of the North-East of Scotland, which had resulted in an increase in traffic along the route between Perth and Aberdeen. In recognition of this, in 1979, the British government announced that it was giving priority to the upgrading of the route to dual carriageway standard. It had already been decided that the trunk route between Dundee and Stonehaven, which had previously followed the same route as the railway line between the two towns, would now follow an inland route through Forfar and Laurencekirk. The new route would incorporate the A85 from Perth to Dundee, the A929 between Dundee and Forfar, the A94 between Forfar and Stonehaven, and the A92 from Stonehaven to Aberdeen; in 1994, the confusion of numbers was resolved with the renumbering of these roads and the creation of the A90 (M90) Edinburgh to Aberdeen trunk road. The coastal route from Dundee to Stonehaven was detrunked in 1978, at the same time as the inland route was trunked.

== History ==
In 1994, it was stated that £139 million had been spent since 1979 on upgrades to the then-A90 between Perth and Aberdeen (the section between Stonehaven and Aberdeen has since become part of the A92).

A grade-separated junction at Longforgan was opened in 1996.

The section of the A90 between Balmedie and Tipperty was upgraded to dual carriageway in 2018. On 3 September 2018, the former section of the A90 between Stonehaven and Blackdog was renumbered A92 in preparation for the opening of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, which became the new route of the A90.

==Route==
From Edinburgh, the A90 travels west and connects to the M90 motorway bypass route that leads to the M9: however, it is only possible to travel northbound when reaching this connection. After connecting with the M90, it runs as a short section of A-road before turning into the M90 properly at the Queensferry Crossing. At Perth, beneath Kinnoull Hill, the M90 again becomes the A90, now running north east to Dundee and through the Kingsway road system. It then passes Forfar, Brechin and Stracathro.

After crossing the Cowie Water just north of Stonehaven, a new junction, opened in 2019, reroutes the A90 road north as part of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR), bypassing the city to its west past the suburban developments of Peterculter, Milltimber, Westhill and Kingswells, turning east past Aberdeen Airport and Dyce. The section of road previously part of the A90 was made part of the A92 and continues via Newtonhill, Portlethen, Cove Bay, the urban area of Aberdeen and the Bridge of Don before rejoining the A90 at Blackdog Junction, where the A&#x27;PRT terminates. Continuing north, the route crosses the Ythan Estuary near Ellon where it becomes a single carriageway, skirting Peterhead (and crossing Balmoor Bridge) on its way to Fraserburgh. The A952 road via Mintlaw is one of Aberdeenshire&#x27;s principal freight routes.

The Dundee to Aberdeen stretch of the A90 has many speed cameras. Previously, the trip from Dundee to Aberdeen along the A90 entailed over a dozen speed cameras including a majority of fixed Gatso types as well as locations used by mobile camera vans. These cameras were found on long fast stretches of road, and shortly before dangerous junctions, such as at the Laurencekirk junction where a speed limit is in force. This was introduced due to this junction&#x27;s appalling safety record. A similar speed restriction was imposed at Forfar until two new grade-separated junctions were built, after which the restriction was lifted. In 2017 Average Speed Cameras were erected between Dundee and Stonehaven, with 15 per side, spaced approximately every for a total of 30 cameras. BBC News reported in January 2018 that speed limit compliance had increased from 2 in 5 to 99 in 100 drivers.

A short stretch of the A90, from the southern terminus of the M90 to Barnton Junction (a junction with the A902), is part of Euroroute E15, which runs from Inverness to Algeciras in Spain. The E15 continues northwards on the M90, and southwards on the A902 leading to the Edinburgh City Bypass.

The A90 ran along the coast and through Aberdeen until the city was bypassed with the opening of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route in 2018. The former stretch of A90 from Stonehaven through to just north of Aberdeen is now part of the A92.

==Future==
In January 2016 the Scottish Government announced £24 million for the design and construction of a new grade-separated junction at Laurencekirk on the A90. Ground investigations were carried out in 2019 in preparation for upgrading the flat junction between the A90 and the A937 to a flyover after a number of deaths. This followed years of local campaigning. However, in 2021 it was announced that work had been delayed. The proposed flyover would require the closure of a flat crossing at Oatyhill Farm which is now the sole access point to some properties after the nearby 170-year-old Oatyhill Bridge, which crosses the Dundee–Aberdeen line, was closed to road traffic in 2020. However, supplementary draft Orders and an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (Addendum) was published in December 2024 to facilitate the necessary works required at Oatyhill to allow the flyover to be built.

Dualling of the section north of Aberdeen has been subject to studies since the 1980s. A proposal was published in 2007 for dualling the section between Balmedie and Tipperty. While the Balmedie to Tipperty segment was eventually dualled as part of wider AWPR works, in 2023 the Scottish Government said it had no plans to dual the route north of Ellon.

==River crossings==
A90 bridges span numerous rivers, estuaries and burns including:
*Carron Water
*Cowie Water
*Burn of Muchalls
*Burn of Pheppie
*Burn of Elsick
*River Dee
*River Don
*Ythan Estuary
*River Tay (via Friarton Bridge)
*Firth of Forth (via Queensferry Crossing)
*River North Esk
*River Ugie (via Balmoor Bridge)

<text>The following is a list of [[professional body|professional bodies]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Membership of a professional body does not necessarily mean that a person possesses qualifications in the subject area, nor that they are legally able to practice their profession.

<text>The Sächsische Schweiz () is a former district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the south of Saxony, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from west clockwise) Weißeritzkreis, the district-free city Dresden and the districts Kamenz and Bautzen. To the south it borders the Czech Republic.

== History ==
The district was created in 1994 when the two districts Sebnitz and Pirna were merged. In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Sächsische Schweiz and Weißeritzkreis were merged into the new district Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge.

== Geography ==
The district is named after the landscape – the &quot;Saxon Switzerland&quot; – as it is the most mountainous region of Saxony. To the west are the Ore Mountains, and to the east the Lusatian Highlands. The river Elbe flows through the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and separates the two mountain ranges. The highest elevation of the district is the high &quot;Oelsener Höhe&quot; in the southwest of the district, the lowest elevation is the valley of the Elbe at the boundary to Dresden which is above sea level.

<doc id="340108" wikidata="Q7371650" url="?curid=340108" title="Rouzbeh Yassini">
<text>Rouzbeh Yassini (), known as the &quot;Father of the Cable Modem&quot;, is an Iranian-American inventor, engineer, and author, who has gained international reputation as a &quot;broadband visionary&quot; for his pioneering work in broadband industry and inventing the cable modem, establishing the cable modem industry standards (DOCSIS) through Cable Television Laboratories (CableLabs), the Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). He is executive director of the University Of New Hampshire Broadband Center Of Excellence and Founder and board member of the YAS Foundation. Yassini is the author of &quot;Planet Broadband&quot; (Cisco Press, 2003), a humanized look at broadband technology and its contributions to the society, as well as &quot;Broadband Intelligent Series&quot;, a series of white papers on digital services (voice, data, video). He is a worldwide speaker and is often interviewed and quoted in the press for his vision on the future of broadband. His lifetime vision and dream is that all the people in the world have ubiquitous access to the broadband and be connected all the time. He believes that broadband connectivity is a fundamental right for all the human beings, what he has referred to it frequently as &quot;Broadband Equality&quot;.
Yassini was founder, CEO, and president of LANcity,
the early pioneer in cable modems (acquired by Bay Networks in 1996). He has worked with Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs) a research arm of the cable television industry in charge of the DOCSIS and on CableHome projects as the cable industry&#x27;s point man on standardizing the cable modem&#x27;s global footprint. He served as a senior executive consultant to the cable industry&#x27;s CEOs while being president and CEO of YAS Corporation.
He also has worked with Comcast and Cablevision on numerous programs relating to innovation of broadband technologies. From 2004 to 2007, Yassini worked with the CTO&#x27;s office at Comcast to create the first industry standard IP-Set top Box specification known as the RNG specification. He has been involved in managing and advising companies ranging from $100 million to $50 billion and served as member of the board of directors on BAS (acquired by ADC in 2000), TrueChat (acquired by Terayon in 2001), and Entropic from 2001 to 2008 (IPO 2007), and UPC Technical Advisory Committee. He created and chaired the Vendor and Operator Executive Advisory Forum of the U.S. Cable Center. He was a member of the Liberty Global Inc. (LGI) advisory technology board from 2001 to 2017. Yassini was director of Visteon from January 2015 to December 2020. As CEO and Chairman of Irystec, a Montreal-based firm founded in 2015 specializing in perceptual display processing technology, Yassini was able to successfully have the French auto company Faurecia acquire the company in 2020, despite the Covid pandemic.
Working for more than 30 years in the broadband industry and achieving major accomplishments, Yassini received many awards from different organizations. In 2024, he received Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy® Award, from the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. In the same year, he was inducted to the Cable Hall of Fame. He also was inducted to the Light Reading Hall of Fame, in 2019. He was named multiple times as CED Broadband 50 designate. CED Magazine named him &quot;1998 Man of the Year&quot; for creating and fostering the multibillion-dollar cable modem broadband industry. The National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NCTA) awarded Yassini with a 2004 Vanguard Award, the Cable Industry&#x27;s highest honor in recognition of his contributions and dedication to the industry. The Cable Television Pioneers also inducted Yassini into the class of 2012 for his tremendous and meaningful contributions to the cable industry. He is a member of the Lane Department Academy as well as West Virginia University Academy of Distinguished Alumni.

==Life and career==
Born in Tehran, Iran, Yassini went to Kharazami high school and attended University of Pahlavi for one year before immigrating to the United States in 1977. Settling in Morgantown, WV, he continued his education at WVU, pursuing a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Science and Electrical Engineering. As a senior, he was fascinated by the burgeoning satellite communications industry, and toiled with classmates to build one of the first 3.7 – 4.2 GHz down converters.

Upon graduation in 1981, he was recruited by General Electric, the place that entered him into high-tech industry. In 1984 he had his first brush with the cable TV industry, working with GE&#x27;s Comband division developing the company&#x27;s first 5,000-gate custom designed set-top chip. After numerous promotions, as the &quot;Engineering Manager for Cable TV systems and microwave&quot; he left GE in 1986 to work for Proteon a data networking company manufacturing token ring networking products like routers and bridges.

It was at Proteon, that the idea of using the same cable for transmitting video and data came to him. Though, people told him video and data couldn&#x27;t mix. From 1988 to 1990 he oversaw Applitek, a data networking company, as president and CEO where he was persuaded that mixing video and data is possible, although the vision remained on hold until 1990 when he bought Applitek&#x27;s assets and formed LANcity where the cable modem was born and the DNA of broadband was built.

==LANcity==

In 1990, Yassini founded LANcity, introducing the first high-speed communications modem designed to integrate with cable television networks, spawning a new consumer electronics technology category known as the cable modem used today by more than 12 million U.S. households. Yassini knew that he had to build a product that was based on industry standards, and not proprietary protocols. Hence, the priority of his small company with 13 employees was to develop an &quot;Ethernet bridge&quot; that interfaced between an Ethernet data network on one side, and the broadband cable TV network on the other. His vision and tremendous effort in Cable Technology and Data Networking eventually resulted in the invention of cable modems, creation of the broadband industry and the era of the high-speed cable modem.

The first generation of modems cost $15,000 for LANcity, and was not compatible with all cable configurations. Yassini took assistance from DEC to build the second generation modems. However, with the advent of personal computers, DEC faced financial problems, so Yassini brought in John Ulm from Hewlett Packard to redesign the modem, and Kurt Baty was hired to develop a new 200,000-gate silicon chip. With his new team and more than a decade of his vision in cable and data technology, in 1993 LANcity launched its second generation modems, at $5000 which was more affordable and more reliable and drew the attention of respected industry engineers. By 1995, LANcity deployed its third-generation &quot;plug-and-play&quot; modem for less than $500, obtained 80 percent of the admittedly small cable modem market share. Bringing the technology from $15,000 to $500 within five years and making it more affordable for personal use was a great achievement for LANcity that was acquired by Bay Networks in mid-1996.

==DOCSIS==
In late 1996 Yassini was invited to join Cable Television Laboratories (CableLabs) to establish the Cable Modem Industry Standards DOCSIS. He worked 18-hour days at the CableLabs office in Denver, CO, driving a team of volunteer staff from 400 suppliers and 20 cable operators, and key contributors to establish Data over Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS), a pillar of today&#x27;s worldwide, multibillion-dollar broadband industry. His tremendous effort within the first six years of working with CableLabs with responsibility over strategic vision, tactical execution, and budgeting resulted in a fully interoperable cable modem standard, a complex document that is used by many cable operators to transfer data over their cable infrastructures. Yassini also worked through the Society of Cable and Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to establish DOCSIS as an international standard. His prominent contribution to DOCSIS and his pioneering work in cable broadband technology as founder and CEO of LANcity, earned him the title of &quot;Father of Cable Modem&quot;. Yassini worked with CableLabs to improve DOCSIS to address the issues on Bandwidth and business quality Services from (1996–2003).

==YAS Corporation, LLC==
In 1996, Yassini founded YAS Corporation, LLC in Boston, MA where he served as CEO and president from 1997 to 2017. As founder, president and CEO of &quot;YAS&quot; (which refers to a pleasant-smelling Iranian flower Of Jasmine), Yassini was instrumental in the creation of multiple start-up companies that have either been acquired or have successfully staged initial public stock offerings. He also led hundreds of strategic and tactical projects that improved the quality of life for citizens across the world. He served as senior executive consultant and member of the board of directors on a number of privately and publicly held companies, ranging from small innovative start-ups (Broadband Access Systems, TrueChat, Entropic Communications, and others) to leading broadband service providers such as Comcast, Cablevision Systems Corp., Cox Communications and Time Warner Cable, which collectively serve tens of millions of customers. He is currently a member of the Liberty Global Inc. (LGI) advisory technology board and UPC Technical Advisory Committee.

== Yassini Broadband Knowledge Center (YBKC) ==
In the spring of 2008, Yassini opened the Yassini Broadband Knowledge Center (YKBC), in Boston, MA. The Broadband Academy, which is the research division of YAS, built and operated the first ever broadband building with 50 Broadband applications showcasing TRUE POWER OF Broadband, and offering grants and facilities to advance and promote broadband technologies, services, and applications. The center was transferred later to the University of New Hampshire in 2012, through the Broadband Center of Excellence (UNHBCoE).

== UNHBCoE ==
To further the pursuit of his long-term vision to ensure global, ubiquitous broadband connectivity for all, in September 2013 Yassini announced the opening of the University Of New Hampshire Broadband Center Of Excellence (UNHBCoE) in Durham, N.H where he acts as its executive director and board member, oversees the center&#x27;s efforts to investigate fresh ideas in broadband Internet technology and make the technology available to everyone, everywhere.

At UNHBCoE, Yassini with a team of researchers, professors, and broadband pioneers (the same team at YKBC) put all his effort to extend broadband to unserved and under-served communities, promotes UNH as a fully broadband-enabled university and home to the UNH Interoperability Laboratory, a world-recognized independent networking and data communications testing facility and to show how an entire city or state can use broadband services and improve the quality of life. His lifetime dream is that all the people in the world are connected to the broadband 24×7 no matter where they are located.

<text>The Navy Lark is a radio sitcom about life aboard a British Royal Navy frigate named HMS &quot;Troutbridge&quot; (a play on HMS &quot;Troubridge&quot;, a Royal Navy destroyer) based in HMNB Portsmouth. In series 1 and 2, the ship and crew were stationed offshore at an unnamed location known simply as &quot;The Island&quot;. In series 2 this island was revealed to be owned by Lt. Cdr. Stanton.

The programme was transmitted on the BBC Light Programme and subsequently BBC Radio 2. It was produced by Alastair Scott Johnston. 

Jon Pertwee is frequently quoted as having suggested the idea of a forces comedy based on the Royal Navy, but Alastair Scott Johnston and writer Lawrie Wyman both contemplated an Air Force- and an Army-themed sitcom before going to the BBC with &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;. Wyman included ideas based on excuses for late return from leave and other misdemeanours from HMS &quot;Troubridge&quot; bulletins. He worked with George Evans (Pertwee&#x27;s personal scriptwriter) from quite early on, but Alastair Scott Johnston did not want him named until the 12th series onward. 

For most of its run the show starred Leslie Phillips, Jon Pertwee and Stephen Murray, whose names rotated in order of precedence with each new episode over the entire 15-series run. Stephen Murray&#x27;s daughter, Amanda Murray, also appeared in a few episodes.

Episodes of &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; series are regularly replayed on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

==Plot==
Episodes were self-contained, although there was continuity within the series, and sometimes a reference to a previous episode might be made. A normal episode consisted of Sub Lt Phillips, scheming Chief Petty Officer Pertwee, and bemused Lt. Murray trying to get out of trouble they created for themselves without their direct superior, Commander (later Captain) &quot;Thunderguts&quot; Povey finding out. Scenes frequently featured a string of eccentric characters, often played by Ronnie Barker or Jon Pertwee. Over the course of the programme Lt Murray marries Admiral Ffont-Bittocks&#x27; daughter Rita.

The Republic of Potarneyland, a country situated somewhere on the Indian subcontinent, is featured in several episodes. Over the course of the series, it is revealed that Potarneyland had recently been granted independence from Great Britain, and had joined NATO because the Potanis considered it to be a &quot;free gift scheme&quot;. During Series 3 of &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;, a Potarneyland frigate, the &quot;Poppadom&quot;, appears in several episodes manned by various Potani officers voiced by Michael Bates and Ronnie Barker.

==Production==

The series used accents and characterised voices to supplement the humour, as well as a good deal of innuendo.

The show&#x27;s theme tune was &quot;Trade Wind Hornpipe&quot; written and performed by Tommy Reilly on a Barry Music compilation of short interlude pieces published in 1958 on BMC118. In one episode, The Return of Sir Frederick Flatley, a brief snippet of the theme tune is heard when Lieutenant Bates tries to connect the ship to a whaling ship by radio and accidentally &quot;connects&quot; to the actual radio. 

The programme was strong on creating identifiable characters; the listener was able to clearly differentiate each person Laurie Wyman created, many of whom acquired enduring catchphrases, most notably from Sub Lieutenant Phillips: &quot;Corrrrr&quot;, &quot;Ooh, nasty...&quot;, &quot;Oh lumme!&quot;, and &quot;Left hand down a bit&quot;. &quot;Ev&#x27;rybody down!&quot; was a phrase of CPO Pertwee&#x27;s, necessitated by a string of incomprehensible navigation orders by Phillips, and followed by a sound effect of the ship crashing. Also, whenever Pertwee had a menial job to be done, Able Seaman Johnson was always first in line to do it, inevitably against his will: &quot;You&#x27;re rotten, you are!&quot;. The telephone response from Naval Intelligence (Ronnie Barker), was always an extremely gormless and dimwitted delivery of Ello, Intelligence &#x27;ere&quot; or &quot;This is intelligence speakin.

Other recurring verbal features were the invented words &quot;humgrummit&quot; and &quot;floggle-toggle&quot; which served to cover all manner of unspecified objects ranging from foodstuffs to naval equipment. Unspecified illnesses include &quot;the twingeing screws&quot;, an illness to which Pertwee was a martyr, especially when hearing about being under sailing orders. Ronnie Barker&#x27;s versatile contributions were recognised and Laurie Wyman (later known as Lawrie Wyman) was asked by the producer to write more parts for Barker.

Dennis Price returned for a guest appearance in the fourth series episode &quot;A Hole Lieutenant&quot;. Other &#x27;guest stars&#x27; included April Walker, Norma Ronald and June Whitfield.

==Radio spin-offs==
===&quot;The TV Lark&quot;===
&quot;The TV Lark&quot; was intended to be a replacement for &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; starting with what would have been the programme&#x27;s fifth series. This situation came about due to the head of light entertainment believing that &quot;forces&quot;-based humour had become dated and television was the next &quot;big thing&quot;, so Lawrie Wyman was ordered to create a show with the same cast in an independent TV station situation. Alastair Scott Johnston and Wyman tried to stop this but were overruled: hence, the arrival of &quot;The TV Lark&quot;.

The entire crew had been drummed out of the service and hired by Troutbridge TV Ltd. Janet Brown joined the cast due to the absence of Heather Chasen for this series. However, mainly due to public pressure, the production team of Alastair Scott Johnston and Laurie Wyman managed to revert the show to nautical capers. Storylines in &quot;The TV Lark&quot; nudged back to naval origins across the ten episodes until they were finally reunited with &quot;Troutbridge&quot;, which continued for another six episodes as the fifth series of &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;.

===&quot;The Embassy Lark&quot;===
Also written by Wyman, three series of &quot;The Embassy Lark&quot; were broadcast from 1966 to 1968. It starred Frank Thornton and Derek Francis.

The show was set in the British Embassy in the fictional country of &quot;Tratvia&quot; and was concerned with the various (mis)adventures of the British Ambassador Sir Jeremy Crichton-Buller (Francis) and his First Secretary Henry Pettigrew (Thornton) as they tried to keep smooth relations between Tratvia, Whitehall and the other Embassies (China, the USSR and the U.S.). Ronnie Barker, Stephen Murray, Lawrie Wyman and Leslie Phillips reprised their &quot;Navy Lark&quot; roles in two episodes. Frank Thornton also appeared in character as Sir Henry Pettigrew in one episode of &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;.

===&quot;The Big Business Lark&quot;===
Another Wyman creation, &quot;The Big Business Lark&quot; was broadcast as one series in 1969. It starred Jimmy Edwards and Frank Thornton

The show is set in the boardroom of fictional company British United Plastics, and concerns the business machinations of the chairman, Sir Charles Boniface (Edwards), and his son and deputy chairman, Frank Boniface (Thornton).

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
In 1959, a film version was released, also called &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;. Written by Laurie Wyman and Sid Colin and directed by Gordon Parry, it stars Cecil Parker, Ronald Shiner, Elvi Hale, Leslie Phillips and Nicholas Phipps. The setting was changed where &quot;The Island&quot; was named Boonsey, a fictional Channel Island. According to Jon Pertwee&#x27;s co-written memoir, published shortly after his death in 1996, the film was also supposed to star Pertwee and Dennis Price. However, according to Pertwee the film&#x27;s producer Herbert Wilcox refused to employ Price &quot;because he was gay.&quot; Pertwee was among those who objected to Price not being in the film and believed that this contributed to his own replacement in the cast by Shiner. Pertwee noted that the film &quot;bombed&quot; and said audiences did not consider the film to be &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; due to the absence of himself, Price and Stephen Murray.

Wyman co-wrote with three other writers a television sitcom &quot;HMS Paradise&quot; (Associated-Rediffusion, 1964–5) set in a naval shore establishment in which Caldicot played Captain Turvey, but only one series was made. The entire series is considered lost.

===Radio adaptations===
The show was cut from 30 to 27 minutes by BBC Transcription services, then the discs were exported around the world except for South Africa. Springbok Radio broadcast to English speaking listeners from their Durban studios, but because it was a commercial station, the BBC refused to allow the station to re-broadcast the recorded shows. However, the station acquired the scripts from Wyman and edited them to around twenty-five minutes each, to accommodate the commercial breaks. The revised show was recorded by local actors in front of a live audience. All the UK associations were kept for the South African audiences.

<text>A god game is an artificial life game that casts the player in the position of controlling the game on a large scale, as an entity with divine and supernatural powers, as a great leader, or with no specified character (as in &quot;Spore&quot;), and places them in charge of a game setting containing autonomous characters to guard and influence.

== Definition ==
God games are a subgenre of artificial life game, where players use supernatural powers to indirectly influence a population of simulated worshippers. It has also been categorized as a subgenre of strategy video games, though unlike other strategy video games, players are unable to tell specific units what to do. The genre is also separate from construction and management simulations, because gameplay revolves around growing and utilizing their supernatural powers to indirectly influence their worshippers, such as by placing a target marker or goal for the worshippers to conquer, or affect those of their opponents, such as by creating natural disasters. God games are typically single-player games played against a computerized opponent, but some involve competition between many rival players.

== Game design ==
God games allow players to take on the role of a god with limited powers, similar to the gods from the mythology of ancient Greece. The player&#x27;s power comes from simulated worshippers, who are usually simple or tribal in nature. It is common for most people in god games to look alike. Early god games only featured models for full-grown men and women, while &quot;Black and White&quot; introduced children. Players must economize quantities of power or mana, which are derived from the size and prosperity of their population of worshippers. The player consumes this power by using godly powers to help their worshippers, such as blessing their crops or flattening hills to make better farmland. This results in a positive feedback loop, where more power allows the player to help their population grow which helps them gain more power. However, more powerful abilities typically require more power, and these usually take the form of natural disasters that can damage rival populations rather than improve life for the player&#x27;s worshippers. Games typically utilize an aerial top-down perspective, similar to a real-time strategy game.

God games are classified as a subgenre of artificial life game because players tend to a population of simulated people that they control only indirectly. Although god games share qualities with both construction and management simulation games and real-time strategy games, players in god games are only able to exercise indirect control over their population. They cannot tell specific units what to do, as seen in strategy games, although players may sometimes compete against other players with their own population of supporters. Moreover, players are given godlike powers not seen in construction or management games, such as the ability to control the weather, transform the landscape, and bless or curse different populations.

== History ==
Although there are many influences on the god game genre, the first god game is widely considered to be &quot;Populous&quot; from 1989. Developed by Peter Molyneux of Bullfrog Productions, the game established the gameplay template where the player&#x27;s godlike powers would grow in proportion to the population of their worshippers. The game gives players supernatural powers over land and nature that could be used for good or evil, and some of this gameplay was emulated by other real-time strategy games with more direct control. Notable hybrids of the genre include &quot;ActRaiser&quot; for the Super NES in 1990. It was also an influence on the real-time strategy hybrid &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, developed by Molyneux in 1997.

Both Molyneux&#x27;s &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; and &quot;Godus&quot; were heavily influenced by the &quot;Populous&quot; series.

<text>Thomas George Prince, MM (October 25, 1915 – November 25, 1977) was an Indigenous Canadian war hero and the most decorated soldier in the First Special Service Force or Devil&#x27;s Brigade, an elite American-Canadian commando unit, during World War II. He was Canada&#x27;s most decorated First Nations soldier, serving in World War II and the Korean War. Prince was one of only three Canadians to receive both the Canadian Military Medal and the American Silver Star during WWII. Prince&#x27;s military deeds as a scout and as a forward combatant were unique and of major strategic importance. He has been described as &quot;perhaps Canada&#x27;s greatest soldier&quot;. 

Tommy Prince was descended from First Nations in Canada chiefs. Prince&#x27;s grandfather had negotiated treaty rights in Manitoba with representatives of The Crown. Prince himself would also represent First Nations concerns in Ottawa as Chairman of both the Manitoba Indian Association (currently Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs) and the First Nations of Canada national delegation. He advocated for the abolition of the governing &quot;Indian Act&quot; in Canada and proposed respect for the traditional Crown treaties as the basis of First Nations rights. Prince&#x27;s position, although considered radical at the time, has been vindicated in subsequent decades by Supreme Court of Canada rulings in support of the Crown treaties and is now accepted as government policy.

==Early life==
Born in the Brokenhead Ojibwe Nation, he was one of 11 children of Henry and Arabella Prince of the Peguis First Nation (Brokenhead Ojibwe Nation) near Scanterbury, Manitoba. He was the great-grandson of the Indigenous Chief, Peguis, who, as a very young chief, had led his nation of about 200 people from Sault Ste. Marie, currently in Ontario, on a long distance migration to the southern end of Lake Winnipeg in the late 1790s, keeping their French name, the Saulteaux. Chief Peguis, who lived until 1864, gave his own name to his people, but created the Anglicized name &quot;Prince&quot; for his sons and successors. Tommy Prince was the grandson of Chief Henry Prince, also known as Mis-koo-kenew or Red Eagle, a son of Chief Peguis, who was an original signatory and a principal negotiator of First Nations Treaty 1 at Lower Fort Garry, Manitoba on behalf of the Peguis or Saulteaux tribe on 3 August 1871. The treaty as negotiated reserved hunting and fishing rights for the indigenous tribes of Manitoba, as well as land rights. Chief Henry Prince was also an original signatory to Treaty 2 on 23 August 1875, which reaffirmed the promises contained in Treaty 1. Tommy Prince&#x27;s father Henry Prince was also a chief of the Saulteaux nation.

Tommy Prince&#x27;s family members had a strong military tradition, and had served in the Canadian armed forces in support of the Crown during the 1870 Red River Rebellion. Chief William Prince (a first cousin of Tommy Prince&#x27;s father) had led the Nile Expedition Voyageurs in the relief of General Gordon at the Siege of Khartoum in 1885. During WWI Prince&#x27;s family members had served in France.

Growing up, Prince became a superb marksman with exceptional tracking and stealth skills learned from countless days spent hunting in the wilderness around his Indigenous reserve. Prince&#x27;s father would teach him marksmanship and he developed the skill to shoot five bullets through a target the size of a playing card at 100 metres. He attended Elkhorn Residential School, completing grade eight, where he studied agricultural science and machinery. He joined the student Royal Canadian Army Cadets and later stated, &quot;As soon as I put my uniform on, I felt like a better man. I even tried to wear it to class.&quot; He continued with the Army Cadets throughout his teenage years. Prince had aspirations to become a lawyer, but had to leave school at age 16 due to circumstances of the time, dire family finances during the Great Depression. He was employed at a variety of manual-labour positions but primarily as a tree feller.

==World War II==
===First Special Service Force (FSSF) creation===

At the start of World War II in September 1939 Prince volunteered to fight with the Canadian Army, although First Nations members were not subject to any conscription for national defence and were not required to join the armed forces. He easily met the requirements for recruitment, but was turned down several times. He was finally accepted on 3 June 1940 at a time when the war had reached a crisis for British and Canadian forces with defeat in the Fall of France. Prince was shortly afterwards transported by ship to England. He was originally a member of the Royal Canadian Engineers, trained as a &quot;sapper&quot; or member of a combat engineering platoon. He was promoted to lance corporal in February 1941. Prince eventually became bored with the routine duties spent mostly behind a desk or a lathe, and joined organized Canadian Army sports activities such as running and boxing. Later in 1942 he learned of the creation of a new unit which interested him, and he volunteered for duty with a parachute unit designated the 2nd Canadian Parachute Battalion. This designation was used to disguise the true reason for the recruitment of parachute volunteers in the UK at that time: the United States and Canada had begun the formation of a special force to conduct secret sabotage and raids against German deuterium plants or heavy water production being used in atomic weapons research in German-occupied Norway. Men were recruited in Canada and in the overseas Canadian Army in Britain for this unit secretly named the First Special Service Force. The Canadians involved with this training continued to be listed on the rosters of their prior units. Although later given an official title of the 2nd Canadian Parachute Battalion for administrative purposes, no such unit actually existed. Prince then reported to the UK&#x27;s parachute school at RAF Ringway, near Manchester. Out of 100 initial volunteers, Prince was one of the nine graduates of the parachute course to be chosen to continue with the selection program.

In September 1942 he returned to Canada where his enlistment was registered as the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion (1CPB), and was promoted to sergeant. He then formally but unofficially volunteered for the still confidential and unknown 1st Canadian Special Service Battalion and proceeded to Fort Benning, Georgia, where they were forming. The Canadians were well below strength due to injuries in training and washouts of substandard recruits. They agreed to bolster the 1st Special Service Force (later known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;) commando unit by allowing men to volunteer, and were transported to Helena, Montana where the Americans in the Force were training. Due to security and secrecy concerns, the Americans and Canadians were transported to Montana by trains with the windows blacked out, so that no one would know where they were headed. The modern American and Canadian special operations forces trace their heritage to this unit. The Force initially consisted of 1,800 men, 900 Americans and 900 Canadians, and one-half of the officers were Canadian and the Brigade second-in-command was a Canadian. As casualties reduced the size of the Force during combat, the Canadian contingent could not be completely replaced due to manpower restrictions in the Canadian Army, and eventually about two-thirds of the brigade were American and one-third Canadian.

The Brigade commander was Robert T. Frederick, who had masterminded the creation of the unit. Frederick would later be hailed by Winston Churchill as &quot;the greatest fighting General of all time&quot;. American equipment, arms, and uniforms were used and provided by the U.S. government with a Canadian financial contribution. Prince and the other men of this unit were originally chosen for their rugged outdoor backgrounds and received rigorous training, often under live fire. Only single men were chosen for the Force, married men were not accepted. All members of this elite commando force received intensive instruction in stealth tactics, hand-to-hand combat, the use of explosives for demolition, amphibious warfare, rock climbing and mountain fighting and as ski troops. They were trained meticulously in the operation and assembly of German weapons, in the event that it became necessary to use German weapons on the battlefield during combat. This training in German weapons would later prove to be of critical importance in some of the Force&#x27;s battles. Prince became a &quot;Reconnaissance Sergeant&quot;—or, in the Force table of organization, a &quot;Scout&quot;—responsible for moving into forward positions and reporting on the movements of the enemy.

===Warrior Traditions===
Prince&#x27;s Ojibwe First Nations warrior traditions would be assimilated into his combat skills. The Ojibwe/Algonkian warrior traditions emphasized the skills of stealth and invisibility in their tactical methods. Even in large scale battles, once the action commenced the fighting was undertaken on a single combat basis by individual warriors. The causes and resolutions of the battle were determined by individual grievances, and loss of life was deliberately circumscribed to resolve the issues with a minimum of casualties.

===Italy deployment===
The Norwegian operations were cancelled due to changes in Allied strategy against the German deuterium plants which were instead destroyed by Norwegian commandos. To prevent the Force from being disbanded, Frederick then volunteered the FSSF to fight against the Japanese in Alaska. Following reassignment, the 1st Special Service Force was initially deployed in the Aleutians for possible actions against Japanese forces, but no battlefield situations materialized. 

The unique capabilities of the Force in mountain warfare were finally recognized by Allied commanders in the Italian campaign, and the Force then moved to Italy in November 1943. They would take part in the stalled Allied offensive against the Bernhard or Winter Line, which had effectively obstructed the Allied push towards Rome. In December and January, the 1st Special Service Force would be assigned to assault enemy positions which were regarded as impregnable, Monte la Difensa, Hill 720, Monte Majo and Monte Vischiataro, assignments which large assaulting formations of Allied soldiers had failed to attain, and had sustained enormous and sometimes catastrophic casualties in the attempts.

After a temporary posting in Naples, the Force moved on 20 November 1943 to a permanent base at the Italian Artillery School barracks approximately one-half mile west of Santa Maria well north of Naples near Monte Cassino. It was from this location that Tommy Prince initially discovered and developed his capabilities of entering enemy locations at night without making any sound and without the enemy being aware of his presence. Prince&#x27;s ability to move in complete silence wearing traditional Ojibwe moccasins into situations where the enemy could be threatened became known to senior officers such as Lt. Col. Tom Gilday, who commanded Prince&#x27;s battalion. Gilday established a close working relationship with Prince and would assign him to special tasks requiring his unusual abilities.

===Monte Majo===
Monte Majo and Monte la Difensa were the critical twin mountain peaks which anchored the German defensive lines in Italy. The 1st Special Service Force managed to succeed in the Battle of Monte La Difensa on 3 to 9 December 1943 by scaling a steep cliff at night and attacking the German forces on the summit. The other principal objective planned for early January 1944 was the taking of Monte Majo, which was assigned to the Canadian contingent of the Devil&#x27;s Brigade, and was an almost insurmountable problem. German artillery and machine-gun emplacements had been arranged in layers on the steep slopes. An attack on any one of them would alert the other defenses and also the main German positions on the summit. Any assaulting force would be met with withering fire.

Lt. Col. Gilday, desperate to devise some strategy for the assault, assigned Tommy Prince to lead a patrol and move at night in an attempt to create a pathway for an assault on Monte Majo by eliminating the enemy gun emplacements on the lower and middle slopes of Monte Majo blocking the intended route. This would require Prince to execute his orders without making any sound or arousing the other German positions. If Prince&#x27;s mission succeeded, it would allow an assault by the Force to follow immediately and climb up the steep mountain side. The offensive was planned for 8 January 1944.

The commanding officer for the attack on Monte Majo, Cpt. Mark Radcliffe, remarked that Tommy Prince &quot;moved just like a shadow&quot; as he led his patrol away from the forward outpost into the night. Under cover of darkness, Prince led his patrol partway up the lower slopes to a position where he left his men behind as a supporting group, should they be needed to provide covering fire. Prince then single-handedly approached and entered the successive German gun emplacements one after another, commencing with the gun pits on the lower slopes and then proceeding with the higher emplacements on the middle slopes. He successfully dispatched all of the gunners and soldiers in the artillery and machine gun bunkers with complete silence and without eliciting any enemy alarms or defensive fire. Prince then returned with his patrol to Cpt. Radcliffe&#x27;s forward post before dawn and reported that his mission was accomplished. All of the German gun pits located on the intended route of the Force&#x27;s assault at the base and the middle of Monte Majo had been neutralized, with only the German positions on the summit remaining to defend the mountain.

When the Force commenced their movement up the slopes of Monte Majo, they passed by the now silent German machine gun and artillery bunkers, and Radcliffe became aware that Prince had done &quot;a beautiful job&quot;. Radcliffe never learned the exact details of how Prince had managed to accomplish this stunning result, beyond the fact that Prince had entered the gun emplacements and had then eliminated the gun platoons. Radcliffe&#x27;s company leading the attack was able to ascend to the summit of Monte Majo without firing a single bullet. According to an interview with Radcliffe, “We were...ordered to attack Monte Majo. There was no cover, just a bald hill. I sent scouts forward to take out the German machine gun positions. The Germans didn’t even know we were on them, the attack was that well executed.” By 05:30 the last enemy positions were overrun. Prince&#x27;s silent feat of arms enabled the daring assault by the Brigade on Monte Majo to proceed, the enemy taken by complete surprise.

Once in control of the summit, the Force made use of captured German heavy machine guns which had been abandoned during the enemy retreat to repel a long series of fierce German counter-attacks over a period of several days. The distinctive sound of the German heavy guns were identified by the German counter-assault soldiers, who would shout out in confusion to the Force soldiers holding the summit, in German, &quot;Stop shooting at us! We are Germans!&quot; Prince would also be involved in these later actions to defend the summit against counter-attack. Following the taking of Monte Majo and the intense battle in defence of the position, the 1st Special Service Force had been reduced from 1,800 men at the start of the winter campaign to only 400 as a result of casualties.

The 1st Special Service Force was awarded the Battle Honour &quot;Mount Majo&quot; for this action by both the U.S. and Canadian governments. Tommy Prince did not receive any individual award or medal for his unparalleled and essential contribution to the successful outcome. Prince&#x27;s special skills and acts of stealth at Monte Majo would have been regarded as classified information related to a secret mission. The nature of Prince&#x27;s assignment at Monte Majo could not have been described in a medal nomination or citation without compromising the security of future operations. In recent years, special operations soldiers are often awarded high decorations in secret, but are not awarded the highest decorations to avoid public exposure. The 1st Special Service Force, a unit in which heroic acts were commonplace, earned many unit awards which were shared by the entire Brigade, but comparatively infrequently awarded individual medals to its men. Prince&#x27;s accomplishments at Monte Majo were of singular status which surpassed the range of any existing medal.

In November, 2019, a Bravery In Arms documentary was produced of the First Special Service Force assault on Monte Majo. In the documentary, Prince&#x27;s accomplishment was described while showing the actual location of the battle.

===Anzio===
After breaking through the German Bernhard Line, the 1st Special Service Force was then moved to Anzio, where a U.S. and Allied landing had been contained and was heavily under attack. The 1st Special Service Force, now comprising about 1,200 men, was tasked with holding several miles of perimeter against a full German division. 

On 5 February 1944, near Littoria, Prince was sent forward by Lt. Col. Gilday to report the location of several German assembly points, including artillery positions. When Prince failed to return the following day, Gilday feared that he had been killed or captured by the Germans. However, Prince suddenly emerged from the darkness into Gilday&#x27;s post two nights later and reported to Gilday how he had found a deserted farm house close to major German gun positions. With Prince still observing from inside the farmhouse, German patrols had then arrived and occupied the house. Prince had managed to elude the Germans searching the house without being discovered and had then hid in the attic for another day until the Germans left. 

The following night after this report, Prince was sent back by Gilday to the same farmhouse bearing thousands of feet of communications wire. From the abandoned farmhouse about from the enemy assembly area, he could report the location of their emplacements using of telephone wire. The next day, an artillery duel developed as the Allies attempted to knock out the guns reported by Prince, and one of these rounds cut the telephone wire. Prince discovered some farmer&#x27;s clothes in a closet in the house, found some tools in the farm shed, and walked out dressed as a farmer weeding the crops. Locating the damaged wires, he rejoined them while pretending to tie his shoelaces. He made a show of shaking his fist at the nearby Germans, then again toward the Allied lines. Returning to his lookout spot he continued his reports, and over the next 24 hours four German batteries were knocked out of action. In all he spent three days behind enemy lines. 

When Prince returned to the Force positions and made his report, Lt. Col. Gilday asked Prince about the identity of the Italian farmer who had been observed near his position. When Prince replied that it was himself in disguise, Gilday pointed out to Prince that if he had been apprehended by the Germans while in the peasant clothes, he would have been executed as a spy. 

For this action he was awarded the Military Medal, his citation reading (in part) &quot;Sergeant Prince&#x27;s courage and utter disregard for personal safety were an inspiration to his fellows and a marked credit to his unit.&quot; Gilday&#x27;s decision to recommend Prince for this medal immediately launched the reputation of Tommy Prince among the soldiers in the 1st Special Service Force as well as in other Allied units.

During the Anzio campaign, Prince would change his boots and don moccasins which he carried in his backpack whenever requiring silent movement. He would reportedly sneak past German security guards at night and enter enemy sleeping locations, leaving messages or warnings, stealing boots, and sometimes using his knife to dispatch an enemy soldier. These psychological warfare attacks earned the nickname of &quot;Geist&quot; (&quot;ghost&quot; in English) or &quot;Teufel&quot; (&quot;devil&quot; or &quot;demon&quot; in English) from the German soldiers.

Prince would also maintain a regular sniping schedule at Anzio, under his own initiative. He would venture out at night into no-man&#x27;s land between the opposing armies, choose a hidden vantage point, and target any German who wandered within his sights. 

On one occasion he went searching for a German sniper who had been targeting the Force positions. The two ace snipers exchanged fire in a personal duel, with Prince eventually shooting the German who fell dead from a tree. 

Before long, the German division opposing the 1st Special Service Force had retreated nearly two and a half miles away from direct contact, apparently shaken by the night activity of the Devil&#x27;s Brigade.

===France===
After being the vanguard of the US forces liberating Rome on 4 June 1944, the FSSF was moved to southern France as part of Operation Dragoon. First they would assault the Hyères Islands before going ashore at Sylvabelle on the French Riviera. There the force was ordered, as part of the 1st Airborne Task Force, to push eastward toward the Franco-Italian border.

On 1 September Prince and a private were sent forward through the German lines to scout the enemy positions near L&#x27;Escarène and came across an encampment area of an enemy reserve battalion. Prince conducted a detailed observation of this German battalion at close quarters using natural foliage as a cover. He avoided being detected by the enemy.

On the way back to report this discovery, Prince and the private came upon a battle between some German platoons and a squad of French partisans.
Prince, an expert sniper, and the private started sniping the Germans from behind, killing about 12 of them and wounding many others, and the startled Germans eventually withdrew. Prince made contact with the French leader, who asked Prince where the rest of his company was located. When Prince pointed to the private and said &quot;Here,&quot; the French commander exclaimed that he had thought there were about 50 men involved in his relief. The French commander recommended Prince for the Croix de Guerre, but the courier was killed en route and the message never reached the French Commander-in-Chief, Charles de Gaulle.

Prince continued on and penetrated the German lines to rejoin the Force positions. He then led it back to the encampment of the German reserve forces and, together with the French squad of resistance fighters which Prince had rescued, joined in the battle which was on 5 September. As a result, the entire German battalion of about 1,000 men was killed or captured. From start to end Prince had been without food, water or sleep for 72 hours and had walked over 70 km across rugged, mountainous terrain. Afterwards he was recommended for the American Silver Star, his citation reading:
With the severe reduction in the number of highly trained original FSSF soldiers due to combat and their replacement by untrained men, General Frederick determined that both US and Canadian personnel would be better suited if they were dispersed to units in their own forces. The 1st Special Service Force was disbanded in December 1944.

===WWII Awards=== 
After returning to the United Kingdom, Prince was summoned to Buckingham Palace on 12 February 1945, where King George VI presented him with his Military Medal. When King George VI made his medal presentations, they would consist of a smile and a handshake, as they did for the other recipients on this occasion. However, when the King came to Tommy Prince, he stopped and discussed for several minutes with Prince his various wartime exploits with the Force, and also asked Prince about current conditions on the Brokenhead Reserve. Prince would later receive his Silver Star from US Brigadier-General E.F. Koenig (on behalf of the American President) on 24 April 1945; he was one of 59 Canadians to receive this award during the war, and one of only three to receive both the Silver Star and Military Medal.

In addition to the Military Medal and Silver Star Decorations, Prince was Mentioned in Dispatches on several occasions. As a member of the 1st Special Service Force, he received the Battle Honour &quot;Mount Majo&quot; for that extraordinary action, although for security reasons he received no individual award for his single-handed secret mission which neutralized the German defences in the battle. He received six service medals for his service in the Italian and North West Europe theatres of war, The 1939-1945 Star, The Italy Star, The France and Germany Star, The Defence Medal, The Canadian Volunteer Service Medal with Overseas Clasp, and The War Medal 1939-1945. The First Special Service Force as a unit was awarded the French Croix de Guerre with Silver-Gilt Star, as well as the Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism.

Prince was reportedly recommended for the French Croix de Guerre for his actions in rescuing a French military unit from German attack in September, 1944, but the courier carrying the information was killed before reaching General de Gaulle. However, in 2002 the Government of France issued an official certificate acknowledging the bravery and contributions of Tommy Prince to the French people and to their freedom from German occupation during WWII, which the French Ambassador to Canada presented to the Prince family. In 2006, the Canadian members of the 1st Special Service Force were each awarded the U.S. Army Combat Infantryman Badge in honour of their service in combat roles in WWII. On 3 February 2015, the U.S. Congress Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to the First Special Service Force as a unit.

The war in Europe ended while Prince was in England.

== Post World War II ==
===Business===
Prince was honourably discharged on June 15, 1945, and returned to his home on the Brokenhead Reserve, working in a pulpwood camp. At this time, his father had recently died while Prince was still overseas, and Prince divorced his first wife. In 1946, a woman attacked him at a dance and cut his cheek with a beer bottle, requiring 64 stitches. After this incident he left the reserve and moved to Winnipeg, although he retained his status as a &quot;Treaty Indian&quot; and did not become a member of Canadian general society.

No longer residing on the reserve, he was then eligible to apply for and receive some start-up business funding from the Department of Veteran&#x27;s Affairs. Prince began a small but relatively prosperous cleaning service.

===Parliamentary Committees and the &quot;Indian Act&quot;===
In 1946 he was elected vice-president of the Manitoba Indian Association (currently Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs). Prince was then appointed chairman of the national delegation representing First Nations of Canada at the 1946 joint Senate and House of Commons Parliamentary Committees in Ottawa which were set up to review the &quot;Indian Act&quot; and to suggest ways to improve the conditions for Native peoples. He traveled across the country and consulted with Canadian First Nations organizations to lobby Ottawa for changes to the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. The &quot;Indian Act&quot; had imposed a paternalistic system on the First Nations, regarding them as &quot;wards of the government&quot;.

Prince advocated for the abolition of the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. The Act had made the First Nations essentially dependent upon the government to manage their lands and resources, and in the process had removed First Nations rights of access to capital markets, investment possibilities, and property ownership outside the reserves. Prince insisted that the traditional Crown treaties with the First Nations should be honoured and respected, and that the Crown treaties should form the basis of a new system for First Nations peoples. Tommy Prince&#x27;s grandfather Chief Henry Prince had been a principal negotiator and signatory of Treaty 1 and Treaty 2 in Manitoba. The treaty rights had been absorbed into the &quot;Indian Act&quot; and were administered by a federal government department, the Department of Indian Affairs, on behalf of the First Nations, often with poor results. The leases and development of First Nations mineral resources were awarded to private companies owned by non-First Nations venture capitalists outside the reserves.

While Prince succeeded in obtaining several revisions to the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, removing some of the more offensive and outdated provisions of the Act, little fundamental restructuring followed immediately from the 1946 deliberations. It would not be until 1959 that First Nations members obtained the right to vote in Canadian elections without any conditions by an amendment passed by the Canadian Parliament, a revision made with a different political party in power in Ottawa. Beginning in 1960, First Nations men and women could vote no matter where they lived, without having to renounce their Indian status to vote.

In the Parliamentary deliberations with respect to the &quot;Indian Act&quot; and possible amendments, Prince made a positive and powerful impression during the committee meetings, his arguments cogent and well-organized. Government officials considered offering him a position with the Department of Indian Affairs. However, Prince&#x27;s opposition to the &quot;Indian Act&quot; was in conflict with government policy, and in the end, no job offer eventuated. In later decades, the Canadian government would come to accept a policy of eventually phasing out the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, while at the same time affirming the traditional First Nations treaty rights as supported by Supreme Court of Canada rulings. These later developments would constitute belated vindication of Prince&#x27;s position on the issues.

Frustrated with the red tape of Ottawa, he returned to Winnipeg to discover that his cleaning business had folded in his absence because the friends Prince had entrusted to operate it had crashed the truck and sold the parts as scrap metal and had also sold the supplies and equipment, pocketing the money. Prince worked in lumber camps and a concrete factory to make ends meet.

He also continued to work on occasion with the Manitoba Indian Association and when a tribe in northern Manitoba was in trouble for violating provincial hunting regulations, Prince successfully interceded for them in representations to the Manitoba government.

==Korean War==
In August 1950 Prince returned to the Canadian Army to fight with the United Nations troops in the Korean War. &quot;I owed something to my friends who died&quot; in WWII, he stated. Re-instated to his previous rank of sergeant, Prince was now a member of the 2nd Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), the first Canadian battalion to be assigned active duty in the war zone.

===Night Assaults===

In February 1951 the Patricia&#x27;s joined the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade on the battlefield. Prince was sergeant and second in command of his rifle platoon, and he soon resumed his special form of stealth missions. Shortly after his arrival on the battlefield in Korea he selected, trained and led an eight-man night &quot;snatch patrol&quot; into an enemy encampment under cover of darkness and with silent movements. The successful mission returned with two captured heavy machine guns taken from a position which had been heavily defended by Chinese soldiers. After seizing the guns, Prince and his men returned to the Canadian lines without alerting or arousing the enemy. The stealth tactics devised by Prince and executed by his special team resulted in the complete elimination of a strong Chinese defensive position in total silence, without firing any shots, while Prince and his force sustained no casualties. Prince went on to lead his special force on several more successful nocturnal demoralization raids against Chinese forces, again with the complete neutralization of enemy positions accomplished without the loss of any casualties by Prince&#x27;s assaulting force. In 2022, a 2 PPCLI Korean War veteran credited Tommy Prince with saving his life due to the special training which Prince had given him.

Although his company commanding officer was aware of Prince&#x27;s renown as a nocturnal operative, the company CO was unfamiliar with and professed shock at Prince&#x27;s bold methods of operation. Eventually the CO began to assign Prince to lead fewer patrols because he objected that they contained too many risks which could threaten the lives of the soldiers. However, the soldiers of the platoon were impressed with Prince&#x27;s battlefield skills and were supportive of Prince in this disagreement. One military historian later concluded that there existed some jealousy between the officers and Prince because the men of the company respected Prince&#x27;s fighting ability and his reputation. Prince&#x27;s company commanding officer refused to nominate him for any awards or medals for masterminding and leading the unparalleled and successful night raids on Chinese positions. Prince prepared his own report of the dispute and submitted it to Lt. Col. James Stone, the battalion commander. Stone was a veteran of the WWII Italian campaign, where he had won fame with creative offensive tactics, sometimes receiving objections from his superior commanding generals.

===Battle of Kapyong===

Tommy Prince held a prominent role with the 2 PPCLI when it became the first Canadian unit awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation for distinguished service in the Battle of Kapyong on 22–27 April 1951. The battalion defended an important strategic position on Hill 677 despite heavy assault from Chinese forces. The Kapyong Valley provided a potential route for the enemy to encircle the U.S. forces in Korea which were at that point in general retreat across the entire Korean front. The Canadian 2 PPCLI, consisting of about 700 infantrymen and several machine guns, was opposed in the Kapyong River valley by a large Chinese force consisting of two divisions and about 20,000 soldiers. Supporting UN forces initially consisted of a Royal Australian Regiment infantry battalion, fifteen Sherman tanks from an American tank regiment, and two companies of U.S. artillery. However, the Australians were hurriedly withdrawn from the Kapyong battlefield after a fierce firefight with the attacking Chinese, who chased the Australians in hot pursuit. The American tanks came under heavy assault and retreated from the battlefield. Some of the American tanks fired upon the Canadians, wounding one man, before retreating from the battlefield. The two American artillery companies simply fled on foot without firing a single round, abandoning their big guns and mortars, equipment and 50 trucks loaded with ammunition to the enemy. The U.S. artillery companies hiked about ten miles to the east, apparently convinced that a major Chinese breakthrough was imminent at Kapyong. Neither the Australians nor the Americans notified the Canadian forces of their sudden retreat, which left the Canadians encircled and alone in a two-day siege to hold the key position.

Brigadier Burke, who commanded the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, personally flew over the Canadian soldiers and shouted at them through a loudspeaker that they were now cut off and would receive no support. This action angered and unsettled the Canadian soldiers, who jeered Burke as he flew away. Tommy Prince was credited with steadying and motivating many of the nervous young Canadians who voiced a desire to run in the face of overwhelming odds of about 30 to 1. The Canadian battalion commander Lt. Col. James Stone ordered his men to fight in a last stand with the words, &quot;No retreat, no surrender.&quot;

The fighting was fierce and often hand-to-hand with bayonets, the Chinese gaining access to the summit of Hill 677 through the numerous ravines along the sides of the 2,000 ft. hill. Thousands of Chinese soldiers swarmed the Canadian positions, with the Canadians running low on ammunition. The Canadian unit would three times take shelter in their shallow trenches scraped from the rocky ground and call in supporting long-distance artillery fire from 4.5 miles away targeted directly onto their own locations. The forward platoons of the 2 PPCLI were completely overrun by mass attacks of Chinese soldiers. The 2 PCCLI, with their ammunition and supplies exhausted, managed to repel the attacks and the Chinese divisions withdrew with enormous casualties of about 5,000 Chinese soldiers killed and many more wounded during the assaults on Hill 677. By contrast, the 2 PPCLI suffered 12 killed and 35 wounded. The Chinese leadership were not aware of how close to victory they had achieved against the Canadians, who were now without ammunition or supplies, and did not launch a final large-scale assault against the Canadian positions. The enemy divisions withdrew on 25 April. Brigadier Burke had been summarily removed from command while the battle was in progress and UN relief forces were sent to Hill 677 on 26 April.

===Second Battle of the Hook===
Prince&#x27;s wartime duty was taking a toll on his body, and his knees were subject to painful swelling and premature arthritis. He was hospitalized after a medical examination in May 1951. He was later returned to Canada, despite his vigorous protest, and assigned to administrative duties where he served as a platoon sergeant at The Officer Candidate School Canadian Forces Base Borden in Ontario. Here his knees improved, so in March 1952 he volunteered for a second tour of duty in the Far East. He sailed for Korea that October with the 3rd Battalion PPCLI.

Though the battalion was officially still training in November 1952, when Chinese forces attacked a vital sector on the Sami-chon River known as &quot;the Hook&quot; the 3rd PPCLI was called to assist British UN forces in the Second Battle of the Hook to recover the exposed forward position. The Patricia&#x27;s had five members killed in the daylight counter-attack, but were able to recapture the post by November 19. Prince was among the nine wounded in the battalion with shrapnel wounds to his legs, although he continued to fight until the outpost was retaken by Prince and his men. Prince refused evacuation for medical treatment, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t have time for that.&quot;, evidently unwilling to abandon his position at the outpost. He removed shrapnel from his legs with his bayonet by himself. Despite his wounds, he carried another wounded 3 PCCLI soldier on his back to the military medical station. Although he recovered from these wounds, he was hospitalized for several weeks in early 1953 for treatment on his knees. The armistice was signed during this period.

Following the Korean Armistice Agreement, he remained in the army, working as an instructor of new recruits in Winnipeg, Manitoba, until his honorable discharge on October 28, 1953. He continued to work at a personnel depot in Winnipeg until September 1954. He was granted a small military disability pension due to his injured knees.

===Korean War Awards===
Prince&#x27;s company commanding officers in Korea refused to nominate him for any individual award or medal for devising and leading the successful silent night assaults against Chinese forces in March/April 1951, or for leading his men in the recovery of the exposed UN forward position in the Second Battle of The Hook in November 1952.

In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation for the Battle of Kapyong, Prince and his fellow 2 PPCLI members were mentioned in the December 2016 designation of Lt. Col. Stone as an official Korean War Hero by the Government of South Korea Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs. The citation of this award stated that the 2 PPCLI &quot;achieved a milestone victory when they won the Battle of Gapyeong (Kapyong) against formidable attacks from Chinese troops&quot; and that &quot;with their victory in the Battle of Gapyeong (Kapyong), Stone and his soldiers are remembered as the Legends of Gapyeong to this day.&quot; Prince additionally received the Korea Medal (Canadian version) and the United Nations Korea Medal for his service. He was entitled, posthumously, to the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal for Korea after it was created in 1991.

==Later life==
===Access to Government Programs===
Adjusting to civilian life was not easy for Prince after World War II and Korea, and with painfully arthritic knees as a result of the long, harsh conditions during his military service, his capabilities were limited. Although he had been granted a small military disability pension due to his knee injuries, as a First Nations member he was unable to access other programs. Prince was effectively denied access to the special Canadian armed forces WWII veteran benefits programs, which included WWII veterans employment programs, WWII veterans educational support, land purchase support for WWII military veterans, and supplementary income support programs for WWII veterans. The information and application forms for these programs were available only at local Royal Canadian Legion chapters. First Nations members were forbidden entrance to Royal Canadian Legion locations under the terms of the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, as alcohol was present on Legion premises. For this reason, Royal Canadian Legion chapters maintained their own bylaws forbidding the presence of First Nations members due to alcohol on the premises. These bylaws were formally removed nation-wide in 1966, some 20 years after the end of WWII. The requirement by the government to access special war veterans programs solely through Royal Canadian Legion premises, where First Nations veterans were forbidden entrance, appears to have been designed as a ruse to exclude First Nations from participation.

===Reduced circumstances===
After his active military service ended in 1953, Prince married Verna Sinclair, with whom he had five children. At the same time, Prince found a permanent position at a Winnipeg ice cream factory. However, partly due to discrimination against Native people at the time, Prince occasionally encountered hostility from his co-workers who were not aware of his military achievements. Prince never used his military record to promote his interests in civilian life, even with his own family and friends. Although the ice cream plant owner supported him, Prince eventually left the position, unable to tolerate the personal barbs. This occupational failure changed his personal outlook on society in general.

In June 1955 Tommy Prince made the news for his heroism in saving a man from drowning in the Red River at the Alexander Docks in Winnipeg, using an army &quot;stranglehold&quot; to drag the struggling, resisting man to safety. Afterwards he quietly walked away before the media could descend on the scene. However, a bystander had recognized him and gave Prince&#x27;s name to the police and also to the newspapers. In an interview resulting from this, Prince explained his decision to intervene, &quot;I knew how I&#x27;d have felt if I were in the water unable to swim and someone just stood looking at me, not doing a thing.&quot;

His life became increasingly difficult, ultimately ending in his estrangement from his family due to financial problems. Prince and his wife separated in 1964 and his children were placed in foster homes. The movement of his children to different foster homes over short periods of time made it difficult for him to keep in touch with them, although his daughter Beryl remained in one foster home and he visited her every month. Unlike other famous Canadian war heroes who also struggled in their civilian lives after the war ended, Prince was not assisted by well-off friends or offered positions by the government. His advocacy on behalf of First Nations and against the &quot;Indian Act&quot; had placed him as an opponent of prevailing government policies of the day.

He spiraled into a depression, and like many war veterans, he experienced post battle stress symptoms and combat nightmares which caused him to awaken in a sweat and in terror. His personal life continued to deteriorate with alcoholism and homelessness. Winnipeg police officers knew him personally and also of his heroic war service, and would refuse to hold him for intoxication or vagrancy, instead providing transport to a Salvation Army facility. His final years were spent virtually alone, living in a Salvation Army hostel room 6&#x27; by 8&#x27; and subsisting on temporary employment such as janitorial labour. Prince&#x27;s son Tommy Prince Jr. and his girlfriend offered to accommodate his father at their own address, but Prince declined, not wanting to be a burden on his family.

Through courage and perseverance, Prince eventually overcame his alcoholism and would later give coherent media interviews and reminiscences of his military deeds. In order to support himself, he sold off his war medals. Despite his straitened finances, Prince remained generous to others and would give cash to people whom he judged to be worse off than himself.

Prince would attend the annual Remembrance Day reunions with his PPCLI comrades-in-arms. Claude Petit, a former fellow soldier from the Korean War, later stated that he was aware of Prince&#x27;s struggles. Petit believed that &quot;someone should have done something...especially the regiment...he spent his life in there, that&#x27;s all he knew.&quot;

On one occasion at night in 1976 on the Winnipeg streets, Prince was assaulted and beaten by a street gang who were unaware of his identity. Later, in another incident, he was stabbed by a young man who had mistaken him for another First Nations man whom he had been targeting. These serious acts of violence possibly contributed to Prince&#x27;s demise the following year at the age of 62.

===Provincial State Funeral===
He died in 1977 at Winnipeg&#x27;s Deer Lodge Centre, a health care facility specializing in geriatric care and treatment of veterans, and was interred in Brookside Cemetery, Winnipeg. Despite the reduced circumstances of his later years, he had retained his fame and he was given a provincial state funeral, a notable event with significant official representatives and more than 500 people in attendance. At his state funeral service, a delegation from the Princess Patricia&#x27;s Brigade served as his pallbearers. A group of men from the Saulteaux nation sang the &quot;Death of a Warrior&quot; song while his body was lowered into the grave. The PPCLI officer in charge of the military funeral service presented Prince&#x27;s daughter Beverley Prince with the folded flag which had been draped over Tommy Prince&#x27;s coffin. Official representatives included the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba on behalf of The Crown, senior officers of the Canadian Army, and the Consuls of France, of Italy and of the United States representing the respect for Prince of those nations. Prince&#x27;s daughters Beryl and Beverley Prince were astonished at the impressive public response at the funeral of a man who had subsisted on menial jobs during his later years and they wondered where public officials had been during Prince&#x27;s years of struggle with war wounds and unemployment. Prince had never discussed his war record with his daughters, and they were unaware of his status as a public hero before the funeral.

==Honours and legacy==
In 1976, one year before his death, Tommy Prince was awarded the Certificate of Merit by the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood (currently Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs) &quot;for his years of dedicated service to the Indian people of Manitoba.&quot; Prince once stated later in his life, &quot;All my life I had wanted to do something to help my people recover their good name.&quot;

Since his passing, a number of honours have been bestowed in his name. Some of them are:

* Sgt. Tommy Prince Street – Winnipeg, Manitoba
* Sgt. Tommy Prince School – Scanterbury, Manitoba
* The &quot;Tommy Prince Barracks&quot; at Canadian Forces Base, Petawawa, Ontario
* The &quot;Tommy Prince Drill Hall&quot; at the 3rd Canadian division Training Center in Wainwright, Alberta
* Government of Canada &quot;Sergeant Tommy Prince Army Training Initiative&quot; for aboriginal recruiting
* The &quot;Tommy Prince Award&quot;: An Assembly of First Nations scholarship
* The &quot;Tommy Prince Scholarship&quot; at Sault College, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario
* 553 Sgt. Tommy Prince PPCLI Cadet Corps, Winnipeg, Manitoba
* Tommy Prince Road in the Valour Park/Victoria Cross Park – a mixed-use development of Currie Barracks in Calgary, Alberta (2010)
* Tom Prince Drive - Petersfield, Manitoba

In 1968, a major Hollywood film entitled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; was produced, although Tommy Prince, the most decorated member of the Brigade, was not represented in the story line. Early in the film, an American soldier was featured in a soldier gambling scene, whose nickname was &quot;Chief&quot;, perhaps a weak reference to Prince and his royal ancestry.

In 1998, the television documentary &quot;Fallen Hero: The Tommy Prince Story&quot; was aired and was nominated for three Leo Awards. 
The film is available on loan from the Canadian War Museum and from various university libraries.

After Prince&#x27;s death, his military medals changed hands several times before coming up for auction in 2000 in London, Ontario. His nephew, Jim Bear, organized a pledge drive and purchased the medals on 10 August, 2000, for $75,000 on the third bid, an extraordinary bid level for military medals at the time. The bid was backed by pledges from Aboriginal groups, by the Royal Canadian Legion, and by the Canadian government Veterans Affairs Canada Minister Ron Duhamel, the latter two organizations now offering some form of support to the Prince family. The Prince war medals were verified as originals by the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa. Bear then entrusted them for permanent display purposes to the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg, the medals remaining the property of the Prince family.

In 2002, the French Ambassador to Canada presented the Prince family with an official certificate from the Government of France acknowledging the bravery and contributions of Tommy Prince to the French people and to their freedom from German occupation during WWII.

In 2004, the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba unanimously passed a resolution honouring and recognizing Prince &quot;for his contribution and sacrifice to both Canada and to the Province of Manitoba&quot;.

In 2005 Historica Canada released a Heritage Minute on Prince.

On 10 February 2010, it was announced that Canadian actor Adam Beach, who is (like Prince) a Manitoban of the Ojibwe and Salteaux nations, would portray the Canadian war hero in an upcoming movie about his life. Beach had previously portrayed Ira Hayes in the Clint Eastwood film &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;. According to Bay Film Studios, the movie would be a &quot;true account of Canada&#x27;s most highly decorated First Nations soldier&quot;. Beach, 37, said he was honoured to play Prince, calling him a positive role model for all First Nations. The Canadian Armed Forces agreed to participate in the production of the film. The film was later reported delayed by reshooting of scenes and the film studio in bankruptcy.

In 2011, Dan Bjarnason, a military historian who had interviewed Prince, described him as &quot;perhaps Canada&#x27;s greatest soldier.&quot; 

In 2013, the United States Congress passed a bill to award the 1st Special Service Force the Congressional Gold Medal.

In 2016, a play about Prince by playwright Alanis King, &quot;Tommy Prince Story&quot;, was published and critically acclaimed.

In 2016, a plaque honouring Tommy Prince was installed in the main floor of the Legislative Building of the Province of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

In 2019, Tommy Prince was named one of the Persons of National Historic Significance of Canada, on the advice of the national Historic Sites &amp; Monuments Board of Canada.

In November 2019, a Bravery in Arms documentary was produced of the First Special Service Force assault on Monte Majo, in which Prince&#x27;s unparalleled forward combat achievement had prepared the way for a strategically crucial action. In the documentary, Prince&#x27;s accomplishment was described while showing the actual location of the battle.

In June 2020, a group of Conservative Party of Canada Members of Parliament started a petition and sent a letter to Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Governor of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem advocating for Prince&#x27;s face to be displayed on the Canadian $5 bill.

On 17 October 2022 it was announced that Tommy Prince would be the subject of a postage stamp to be issued 28 October 2022, by Canada Post. The stamp shows Prince in his 2 PPCLI uniform from his Korean War period with a background of the Northern Lights (aurora borealis), his name with the designation MM (Military Medal), his decorations and mention of the Silver Star. The official presentation ceremony of the Tommy Prince postage stamp was attended and featured speeches by Prince&#x27;s son Tommy Prince Jr. and by singer Willam Prince, a cousin of the family, who sang a song by Buffy Sainte Marie at the event.

<text>The Steel Bridge is a through truss, double-deck vertical-lift bridge across the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, United States, opened in 1912. Its lower deck carries railroad and bicycle/pedestrian traffic, while the upper deck carries road traffic (on the Pacific Highway West No. 1W, former Oregon Route 99W), and light rail (MAX), making the bridge one of the most multimodal in the world. It is the only double-deck bridge with independent lifts in the world and the second oldest vertical-lift bridge in North America, after the nearby Hawthorne Bridge. The bridge links the Rose Quarter and Lloyd District in the east to Old Town Chinatown neighborhood in the west.

==History==
The bridge was completed in 1912 and replaced the previous Steel Bridge built in 1888 as a double-deck swing-span bridge. The 1888 structure was the first railroad bridge across the Willamette River in Portland. Its name originated because steel, instead of wrought iron, was used in the original bridge&#x27;s construction, which was very unusual for the time. When the current Steel Bridge opened, it was simply given its predecessor&#x27;s name.

The bridge was designed by the engineering firm of Waddell &amp; Harrington, which was based in Kansas City, Missouri, but also had an office in Portland. The structure was built by Union Pacific Railroad and the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company (OWR&amp;N) at a cost of $1.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ). It opened in July 1912 to rail traffic and on August 9, 1912, to automobiles.

The 1888 Steel Bridge (upper deck) had been crossed by horse-drawn streetcars from the time of its opening and then by the city&#x27;s first electric streetcar line starting in November 1889. When the present Steel Bridge opened in 1912, the streetcar lines (all electric by then) moved to it, starting on September 8, 1912. Streetcar service across the Steel continued until August 1, 1948, when the last car lines using it, the Alberta and Broadway Lines, were abandoned. A single line of Portland&#x27;s once-extensive trolley bus system also used the bridge; the Williams Avenue line crossed the Steel Bridge from 1937 until October 9, 1949. (Many years later, in 1986, electric transit vehicles returned to the bridge in the form of MAX Light Rail and later the Portland Vintage Trolley.)

The lower deck of the bridge was threatened by major floods in 1948, 1964, and 1996. The bridge was closed for three days because of the danger during the February 1996 floods.

In 1950, the Steel Bridge and its newly reconstructed approaches became part of a new U.S. 99W highway connecting Harbor Drive and Interstate Avenue.

In the 1960s, the bridge was sought for use by Interstate 5, which was later moved to the Marquam Bridge. Construction of the freeway instead brought the addition to the Steel Bridge of a new viaduct leading onto I-84 from the bridge&#x27;s eastbound lanes.

In 1972, the bridge became part of Route 99W, replacing the US 99W designation. Harbor Drive, and by extension the ramps onto it from the bridge, was demolished from 1972 to 1974. It was replaced by Tom McCall Waterfront Park.
In the mid-1980s, the bridge underwent a $10 million renovation, including construction of the MAX light rail line of TriMet. Beginning in June 1984, the span was closed to all traffic for two years. It reopened on May 31, 1986. Completion and testing of the light-rail tracks and overhead wires across the bridge took place during the next three months and the light rail line opened for service on September 5, 1986. The renovation also saw the crossing gates blocking the roadway and sidewalks during raising of the upper-deck lift replaced and automated. For the current bridge&#x27;s first 72 years, the gates had been manually operated, rotated horizontally across the roadway by two &quot;gate tenders&quot;, one on each side of the lift span. Small shacks for the gatekeepers were positioned on the roadway deck, between the inner and outer traffic lanes, but these were removed during the 1980s rebuilding and replaced by a new gate tender house positioned above the roadway, in the west lift tower. Powered crossing gates replaced the manual ones, and operation of the gates is now controlled remotely, by the bridge operator.

A single-lane viaduct that connected the bridge&#x27;s east approach to another viaduct (still in existence) that takes traffic from southbound Interstate 5 to Interstate 84 was closed in 1988 and was demolished in 1989, as part of roadway changes intended to improve traffic flow around the Oregon Convention Center. The center was under construction at that time and opened in 1990.

In 2001, a and cantilevered walkway was installed on the southern side of the bridge&#x27;s lower deck as part of the Eastbank Esplanade construction, raising to three the number of publicly accessible walkways across the bridge, including the two narrow sidewalks on the upper deck. The bridge is owned by Union Pacific with the upper deck leased to Oregon Department of Transportation, and subleased to TriMet, while the City of Portland is responsible for the approaches.

The average daily traffic in 2000 was 23,100 vehicles (including many TriMet buses), 200 MAX trains, 40 freight and Amtrak trains, and 500 bicycles. The construction of the lower-deck walkway connected to the Eastbank Esplanade resulted in a sharp increase in bicycle traffic, with over 2,100 daily bicycle crossings in 2005. MAX traffic has tripled since 2000, when only the Gresham–Hillsboro line (now the Blue Line) was using the bridge, to 605 daily crossings (weekdays) as of 2012. This resulted from the addition of three more MAX lines during that period: the Red, Yellow, Green Lines.

In the summer of 2008, the upper deck was closed for three weeks to allow a junction to be built at the west end connecting the existing MAX tracks with a new MAX line on the Portland Transit Mall. A change made at that time was that the two inner lanes became restricted to MAX trains only, with cars, buses and other motorized traffic permitted only in the two outer lanes.

In 2012, the Steel Bridge celebrated its 100th birthday. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; called it the &quot;hardest-working&quot; bridge on the Willamette River: &quot;Cars, trucks, freight trains, buses, Amtrak, MAX, pedestrians, bicycles — you carry it all.&quot;

==Structure and lift operation==

The lift span of the bridge is long. At low river levels, the lower deck is above the water, and of vertical clearance is provided when both decks are raised. Because of the independent lifts, the lower deck can be raised to , telescoping into the upper deck but not disturbing it. Each deck has its own counterweights, two for the upper and eight for the lower, totaling .

The machinery house sits atop the upper-deck lift truss. The operator&#x27;s room is suspended from the top of the lift-span truss, directly below the machinery house, so that the operator can view river traffic as well as the upper deck. After the 2001 addition of a pedestrian walkway on the lower deck, cameras and closed-circuit television monitors were added to allow the operator to view the lower-deck walkway.

<text>In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, a Bernstein polynomial is a polynomial expressed as a linear combination of Bernstein basis polynomials. The idea is named after mathematician Sergei Natanovich Bernstein.

Polynomials in Bernstein form were first used by Bernstein in a constructive proof for the Weierstrass approximation theorem. With the advent of computer graphics, Bernstein polynomials, restricted to the interval [0, 1], became important in the form of Bézier curves.

A numerically stable way to evaluate polynomials in Bernstein form is de Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm.

==Definition==
=== Bernstein basis polynomials ===

The formula_1 Bernstein basis polynomials of degree formula_2 are defined as

: formula_3 for formula_4

where formula_5 is a binomial coefficient.

So, for example, formula_6

The first few Bernstein basis polynomials for blending or values together are:
: formula_7

The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree formula_2 form a basis for the vector space formula_9 of polynomials of degree at most formula_10 all with real coefficients.

=== Bernstein polynomials ===

A linear combination of Bernstein basis polynomials

:formula_11

is called a Bernstein polynomial or polynomial in Bernstein form of degree formula_12 The coefficients formula_13 are called Bernstein coefficients or Bézier coefficients.

The first few Bernstein basis polynomials from above in monomial form are:
: formula_14

==Properties==
The Bernstein basis polynomials have the following properties:
* formula_15 if formula_16 or if formula_17
* formula_18 for formula_19
* formula_20
* formula_21 and formula_22 where formula_23 is the Kronecker delta function: formula_24
* formula_25 has a root with multiplicity formula_26 at point formula_27 (note: when formula_28 there is no root at ).
* formula_25 has a root with multiplicity formula_30 at point formula_31 (note: if formula_32 there is no root at ).
* The derivative can be written as a combination of two polynomials of lower degree: formula_33
* The -th derivative at : formula_34
* The -th derivative at 1: formula_35
* The transformation of the Bernstein polynomial to monomials is formula_36 and by the inverse binomial transformation, the reverse transformation is formula_37
* The indefinite integral is given by formula_38 
* The definite integral is constant for a given : formula_39 for all formula_40
* If formula_41 then formula_42 has a unique local maximum on the interval formula_43 at formula_44 This maximum takes the value formula_45
* The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree formula_2 form a partition of unity: formula_47
* By taking the first formula_48-derivative of formula_49 treating formula_50 as constant, then substituting the value formula_51 it can be shown that formula_52
* Similarly the second formula_53-derivative of formula_54 with formula_50 then again substituted formula_51 shows that formula_57
* A Bernstein polynomial can always be written as a linear combination of polynomials of higher degree: formula_58
* The expansion of the Chebyshev Polynomials of the First Kind into the Bernstein basis is formula_59

==Approximating continuous functions==
Let &quot;ƒ&quot; be a continuous function on the interval [0, 1]. Consider the Bernstein polynomial
:formula_60

It can be shown that
:formula_61

uniformly on the interval [0, 1].

Bernstein polynomials thus provide one way to prove the Weierstrass approximation theorem that every real-valued continuous function on a real interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] can be uniformly approximated by polynomial functions over formula_62.

A more general statement for a function with continuous &quot;k&quot;th derivative is
:formula_63
where additionally
:formula_64
is an eigenvalue of &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;; the corresponding eigenfunction is a polynomial of degree &quot;k&quot;.

===Probabilistic proof===

This proof follows Bernstein&#x27;s original proof of 1912. See also Feller (1966) or Koralov &amp; Sinai (2007).

====Motivation====

We will first give intuition for Bernstein&#x27;s original proof. A continuous function on a compact interval must be uniformly continuous. Thus, the value of any continuous function can be uniformly approximated by its value on some finite net of points in the interval. This consideration renders the approximation theorem intuitive, given that polynomials should be flexible enough to match (or nearly match) a finite number of pairs formula_65. To do so, we might (1) construct a function close to formula_66 on a lattice, and then (2) smooth out the function outside the lattice to make a polynomial. 

The probabilistic proof below simply provides a constructive method to create a polynomial which is approximately equal to formula_66 on such a point lattice, given that &quot;smoothing out&quot; a function is not always trivial. Taking the expectation of a random variable with a simple distribution is a common way to smooth. Here, we take advantage of the fact that Bernstein polynomials look like Binomial expectations. We split the interval into a lattice of &quot;n&quot; discrete values. Then, to evaluate any &quot;f(x)&quot;, we evaluate &quot;f&quot; at one of the &quot;n&quot; lattice points close to &quot;x&quot;, randomly chosen by the Binomial distribution. The expectation of this approximation technique is polynomial, as it is the expectation of a function of a binomial RV. The proof below illustrates that this achieves a uniform approximation of &quot;f&quot;. The crux of the proof is to (1) justify replacing an arbitrary point with a binomially chosen lattice point by concentration properties of a Binomial distribution, and (2) justify the inference from formula_68 to formula_69 by uniform continuity. 

====Bernstein&#x27;s proof====

Suppose &quot;K&quot; is a random variable distributed as the number of successes in &quot;n&quot; independent Bernoulli trials with probability &quot;x&quot; of success on each trial; in other words, &quot;K&quot; has a binomial distribution with parameters &quot;n&quot; and &quot;x&quot;. Then we have the expected value formula_70 and
:formula_71

By the weak law of large numbers of probability theory,
:formula_72

for every &quot;δ&quot; &gt; 0. Moreover, this relation holds uniformly in &quot;x&quot;, which can be seen from its proof via Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality, taking into account that the variance of  &quot;K&quot;, equal to  &quot;x&quot;(1−&quot;x&quot;), is bounded from above by irrespective of &quot;x&quot;.

Because &quot;ƒ&quot;, being continuous on a closed bounded interval, must be uniformly continuous on that interval, one infers a statement of the form
:formula_73

uniformly in &quot;x&quot; for each formula_74. Taking into account that &quot;ƒ&quot; is bounded (on the given interval) one finds that
: formula_75
uniformly in &quot;x&quot;. To justify this statement, we use a common method in probability theory to convert from closeness in probability to closeness in expectation. One splits the expectation of formula_76 into two parts split based on whether or not formula_77. In the interval where the difference does not exceed &quot;ε&quot;, the expectation clearly cannot exceed &quot;ε&quot;.
In the other interval, the difference still cannot exceed 2&quot;M&quot;, where &quot;M&quot; is an upper bound for |&quot;ƒ&quot;(x)| (since uniformly continuous functions are bounded). However, by our &#x27;closeness in probability&#x27; statement, this interval cannot have probability greater than &quot;ε&quot;. Thus, this part of the expectation contributes no more than 2&quot;M&quot; times &quot;ε&quot;. Then the total expectation is no more than formula_78, which can be made arbitrarily small by choosing small &quot;ε&quot;.

Finally, one observes that the absolute value of the difference between expectations never exceeds the expectation of the absolute value of the difference, a consequence of Holder&#x27;s Inequality. Thus, using the above expectation, we see that (uniformly in &quot;x&quot;)
: formula_79

Noting that our randomness was over &quot;K&quot; while &quot;x&quot; is constant, the expectation of &quot;f(x)&quot; is just equal to &quot;f(x)&quot;. But then we have shown that formula_80 converges to &quot;f(x)&quot;. Then we will be done if formula_80 is a polynomial in &quot;x&quot; (the subscript reminding us that &quot;x&quot; controls the distribution of &quot;K&quot;). Indeed it is:
:formula_82

====Uniform convergence rates between functions====

In the above proof, recall that convergence in each limit involving &quot;f&quot; depends on the uniform continuity of &quot;f&quot;, which implies a rate of convergence dependent on &quot;f&quot; &#x27;s modulus of continuity formula_83 It also depends on &#x27;M&#x27;, the absolute bound of the function, although this can be bypassed if one bounds formula_84 and the interval size. Thus, the approximation only holds uniformly across &quot;x&quot; for a fixed &quot;f&quot;, but one can readily extend the proof to uniformly approximate a set of functions with a set of Bernstein polynomials in the context of equicontinuity.

=== Elementary proof ===

The probabilistic proof can also be rephrased in an elementary way, using the underlying probabilistic ideas but proceeding by direct verification:

The following identities can be verified:

# formula_85 (&quot;probability&quot;)
# formula_86 (&quot;mean&quot;)
# formula_87 (&quot;variance&quot;)

In fact, by the binomial theorem

formula_88

and this equation can be applied twice to formula_89. The identities (1), (2), and (3) follow easily using the substitution formula_90.

Within these three identities, use the above basis polynomial notation

:formula_91

and let

:formula_92

Thus, by identity (1)

:formula_93

so that

:formula_94

Since &quot;f&quot; is uniformly continuous, given formula_95, there is a formula_96 such that formula_97 whenever
formula_98. Moreover, by continuity, formula_99. But then

:formula_100

The first sum is less than ε. On the other hand, by identity (3) above, and since formula_101, the second sum is bounded by formula_102 times

:formula_103

:(Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality)

It follows that the polynomials &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot; tend to &quot;f&quot; uniformly.

== Generalizations to higher dimension ==
Bernstein polynomials can be generalized to dimensions – the resulting polynomials have the form . In the simplest case only products of the unit interval are considered; but, using affine transformations of the line, Bernstein polynomials can also be defined for products . For a continuous function on the -fold product of the unit interval, the proof that can be uniformly approximated by

:formula_104
is a straightforward extension of Bernstein&#x27;s proof in one dimension.

<text>The Legitimists () are royalists who adhere to the rights of dynastic succession to the French crown of the descendants of the eldest branch of the Bourbon dynasty, which was overthrown in the 1830 July Revolution. They reject the claim of the July Monarchy of 1830–1848 which placed Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans, head of the Orléans cadet branch of the Bourbon dynasty, on the throne until he too was dethroned and driven with his family into exile.

Following the movement of Ultra-royalists during the Bourbon Restoration of 1814, Legitimists came to form one of France&#x27;s three main right-wing factions, which were principally characterized by their counter-revolutionary views. According to historian René Rémond, the other two right-wing factions were the Orléanists and the Bonapartists.

Legitimists believe that the traditional rules of succession, based on the Salic law, determine the rightful King of France. The last ruling king whom Legitimists acknowledge as legitimate was Charles X, and when the line of his heirs became extinct in 1883 with the death of his grandson Henri, Count of Chambord, the most senior heir to the throne according to the Blancs d&#x27;Espagne was Infante Juan, Count of Montizón, a descendant of Louis XIV through his grandson Philip V of Spain. 

The fact that all Legitimist claimants since 1883 have been members of the Spanish royal dynasty, the allegation that their patrilineal descent from Louis XIV has been in question since 1936, and the belief that Philip V renounced claims to the French throne for himself and his heirs-male in the Treaty of Utrecht, are all irrelevant according to Legitimists; however, these facts have prompted other French royalists to pivot to support of the Orléans line, who would be next in the traditional line of succession if Philip V&#x27;s heirs were excluded.

The current Legitimist pretender is Prince Louis, Duke of Anjou, the senior great-grandson of Alfonso XIII of Spain by male primogeniture, whose line was excluded from the Spanish succession due to the physical disability, political commitments, and morganatic marriage of Prince Jacques, Duke of Anjou and Segovia.

== History ==


=== Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830) ===

Following the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, a strongly restricted census suffrage sent to the Chamber of Deputies an Ultra-royalist majority in 1815–1816 (&quot;la Chambre introuvable&quot;) and from 1824 to 1827. Known to be more royalist than the king (&quot;plus royalistes que le roi&quot;), the Ultras were the dominant political faction under Louis XVIII (1815–1824) and Charles X (1824–1830). Opposed to the constitutional monarchy of Louis XVIII and to the limitation of the sovereign&#x27;s power, they hoped to restore the Ancien Régime and cancel the liberal, republican and democratic ideas of the French Revolution. While Louis XVIII hoped to moderate the restoration of the Ancien Régime to make it acceptable to the population, the Ultras would never abandon the dream of an integral restoration, even after the 1830 July Revolution which set the Orléanist branch on the throne and sent the Ultras back to private life in their country chateaux. Their importance during the Restoration was in part due to electoral laws which largely favored them (on one hand a Chamber of Peers composed of hereditary members and on the other a Chamber of Deputies elected under a heavily restricted census suffrage which permitted approximately 100,000 voters).

Louis XVIII&#x27;s first ministers, who included Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, duc de Richelieu and Élie, duc Decazes, were replaced by the &quot;Chambre introuvable&quot; dominated by the Ultras. Louis XVIII finally decided to dissolve this chaotic assembly, but the new liberals who replaced them were no easier to govern. After the 1820 assassination of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, the ultra-reactionary son of the comte d&#x27;Artois (Louis XVIII&#x27;s brother and future Charles X) and a short interval during which Richelieu governed, the Ultras were back in government headed by the Jean-Baptiste de Villèle.

The death in 1824 of the moderate Louis XVIII emboldened the Ultra faction. In January 1825, Villèle&#x27;s government passed the Anti-Sacrilege Act which punished by death the theft of sacred vessels (with or without consecrated hosts). This anachronistic law (according to Jean-Noël Jeanneney) was in the end never applied (except on a minor point) and repealed in the first months of Louis Philippe&#x27;s reign (1830–1848). The Ultras also wanted to create courts to punish radicals and passed laws restricting the press.

After the 1830 July Revolution replaced the Bourbons with the more liberal Orléanist branch, the Ultras&#x27; influence declined, although it survived until at least the 16 May 1877 crisis and 1879. They softened their views and made the restoration of the House of Bourbon their main aim. From 1830 on, they became known as Legitimists.

=== Legitimists under the July Monarchy (1830–1848) ===
During the July Monarchy of 1830 to 1848, when the junior Orléanist branch held the throne, the Legitimists were politically marginalized, many withdrawing from active political life. Until 1844, the situation was complicated by debate as to who the Bourbon heir was, as Charles X and his son, the Dauphin Louis-Antoine had both abdicated during the 1830 Revolution in favor of Charles&#x27;s young grandson, Henri, Count of Chambord. Until the deaths of Charles X and his son in 1836 and 1844, many Legitimists continued to recognize each of them in turn as the rightful king, ahead of Chambord.

=== Legitimists under the Second Republic and the Second Empire (1848–1871) ===
The fall of King Louis Philippe I in 1848 led to a strengthening of the Legitimist position. Although the childlessness of Chambord weakened the hand of the Legitimists, they came back into political prominence during the Second Republic. Legitimists joined with Orleanists to form the Party of Order which dominated parliament from the elections of May 1849 until Bonaparte&#x27;s coup on 2 December 1851. They formed a prominent part of Odilon Barrot&#x27;s ministry from December 1848 to November 1849, and in 1850 were successful in passing the Falloux Law which brought the Catholic Church back into secondary education.

Through much of this time there was discussion of fusion with the Orléanist party in their common interest of a monarchical restoration. This prospect prompted several sons of Louis Philippe to declare their support for Chambord, but fusion was not achieved, and after 1850 the two parties again diverged. The most committed Orléanists supported the candidacy of Louis Philippe&#x27;s third son, François d&#x27;Orléans, Prince of Joinville, for the presidency while the Legitimists largely supported allowing Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to run for a second term. In spite of this support for Bonaparte&#x27;s ambitions, they opposed his scheme to restore universal suffrage in the last months of 1851, and their leaders, like those of the Orléanists, were arrested during Bonaparte&#x27;s coup.

The period of the Second Empire saw the Legitimists once again cast out of active political life.

=== Legitimists under the Third Republic (1871–1940) ===
Nevertheless, the Legitimists remained a significant party within elite opinion, attracting the support of the larger part of the remaining Ancien Régime aristocracy. After the Siege of Paris in 1870 and the 1871 Paris Commune, the Legitimists returned one final time to political prominence. The 8 February 1871 election, held under universal manhood suffrage, gave the National Assembly a royalist majority supported by the provinces while all the Parisian deputies were republican. This time the Legitimists were able to agree with the Orléanists on a program of fusion largely because of the growing likelihood that the Chambord would die without children. The liberal Orléanists agreed to recognize Chambord as king and the Orléanists claimant himself Prince Philippe, Count of Paris (1838–1894) recognized Chambord as head of the French royal house. In return, Legitimists in the Assembly agreed that should Chambord die childless, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans would succeed him as king. Unfortunately for French monarchism, Chambord&#x27;s refusal to accept the tricolor as the flag of France and to abandon the &quot;fleur-de-lys&quot;, symbol of the Ancien Régime, made restoration impossible until after his death in 1883, by which time the monarchists had long since lost their parliamentary majority due to the 16 May 1877 crisis. The death of Chambord effectively dissolved the Legitimists as a political force in France.

Affected by sinistrisme, few conservatives explicitly called themselves right-wing during the Third Republic as it became a term associated with the counter-revolution and anti-republican feelings and by the 1900s was reserved for reactionary groups. Those Legitimists who had rallied to the Republic in 1893, after Chambord&#x27;s death ten years before still called themselves or (Constitutional or Republican Right). However, they changed their name in 1899 and entered the 1902 elections under the name (Liberal Action). By 1910, the only group which openly claimed descent from the right wing gathered only nostalgic royalists. From 1924 on, the term right-wing practically vanished from the parliamentary right&#x27;s glossary.

By this time, the vast majority of Legitimists had retired to their country chateaux and abandoned the political arena. Although the (French Action) remained an influential movement throughout the 1930s, its motivations for the restoration of monarchy were quite distinct from older Legitimists&#x27; views and Charles Maurras&#x27; instrumental use of Catholicism set them at odds. Thus, Legitimists participated little in the political events of the 1920s and 1930s, in particular in the 6 February 1934 riots organized by far-right leagues. The royalist aristocrats clearly distinguished themselves from the new ultra right which was influenced by the emerging movements of fascism and Nazism. However, Legitimists joined Maurras in celebrating the fall of the Third Republic after the 1940 Battle of France as a divine surprise and many of them entered Philippe Pétain&#x27;s Vichy administration, seeing a golden opportunity to impose a reactionary program in occupied France.

=== Legitimists under Vichy and after World War II (1940–1989) ===
French royalism largely receded to irrelevance in World War II and beyond. While before World War II, many French conservatives and other members of the right also harbored royalist aspirations, conservative movements dropped this platform during and after the war. Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s center-rightist Gaullism explicitly repudiated monarchism, and far-right organizations disdained the old aristocratic elite. According to historian René Rémond&#x27;s studies of right-wing factions in France, Legitimists strongly supported the Vichy regime; nevertheless, they received little from the Vichy government, and the regime emphasized Catholic traditionalism rather than a return to aristocracy. 

Legitimism revived after the Second World War for several reasons. 

* In 1946, the senior Capetian heir, Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, the eldest surviving son of King Alfonso XIII of Spain, who 13 years earlier had renounced his rights to the throne of Spain on account of his deafness, took up the courtesy title of Duke of Anjou. 
* The academic work of historians like Hervé Pinoteau, jurists like Guy Augé and Stéphane Rials or genealogists like Patrick Van Kerrebrouck challenging the Orléanist theses have received a certain response from the public.
* The positions taken by Henri d&#x27;Orléans, Count of Paris, in particular in favor of General de Gaulle, Algerian independence and François Mitterrand shocked certain royalists.
* During the Capetian millennium of 1987, the then senior Capetian heir, Alfonso de Bourbon, Duke of Anjou and Cadiz, elder son of the aforementioned Infante Jaime, made himself known by presiding over numerous commemorative ceremonies. In the wake of the Capetian millennium, media personalities like Thierry Ardisson popularized Legitimist conceptions.

Since the accession of King Juan Carlos I of Spain in 1975, the senior Capetian heirs have not laid claim to the throne of Spain. The Legitimist suitor having had French nationality (which he had since birth, owing to his French mother) in 1987, and passing the nationality on to his son (the current suitor), certain arguments of the partisans of Orléans would have become obsolete.

According to René Rémond, Marcel Lefebvre&#x27;s Society of Saint Pius X, founded in 1970, shares aspects with the Legitimist movement. Nevertheless, Legitimism is a largely spent force.

=== Legitimism from 1989 to present, under the pretendence of Louis de Bourbon ===

Current legitimism has several instances:
* The private secretariat of Louis de Bourbon, which takes care of his public affairs (diary, outings and official participation in the various events to which he is invited).
*The Secretariat also manages the Prince&#x27;s communication and in particular his official website www.legitimite.fr as well as his presence on social networks.
* On the cultural level, the Institute of the House of Bourbon (IMB) was founded in 1973 at the request of Jacques-Henri de Bourbon. It was recognized as being of public utility in 1997. Its honorary president is Prince Louis, Duke of Anjou and its president, Charles Emmanuel, Duke of Bauffremont (born 1946), who succeeded his father in this position. In order to make better known the work of the kings who made France, the IMB organizes symposiums, conferences, travel exhibitions, and various commemorations. It also has a sponsorship and heritage protection action (commemorative plaques, restoration of graves, monuments, etc.)
* The Union of Legitimist Circles of France (UCLF), founded in 1979 by Gérard Saclier de La Bâtie. Its objective is to encourage the study of French historical legitimacy and to make the monarchy known. It brings together a large number of associations and circles and organizes political training days and demonstrations.
* (CAL), founded in 2012 by Loïc Baverel. Originally conceived as a branch of the UCLF, Loïc Baverel wanted to change militant methods by creating his own Circle. The objective of the CAL is political and aims to professionalize the militant approach in order to promote Legitimist principles.

== Spanish Bourbons ==

A remnant of Legitimists, known as the (Whites of Spain), by repudiating Philip V&#x27;s renunciation of the French throne as and contrary to the fundamental French monarchical law, upheld the rights of the eldest branch of the Bourbons, represented as of 1883 by the Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne. This group was initially minuscule, but it began to grow larger after World War II due both to the political leftism of the Orléanist pretender Henri, Count of Paris and to the active efforts of the claimants of the elder line after extinction of the Carlist male line—Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, the disinherited second son of Alfonso XIII of Spain; and his son Prince Alphonse, Duke of Anjou—to secure Legitimist support, such that by the 1980s the elder line had fully reclaimed for its supporters the political title of Legitimists.

The Spanish-born Prince Luis Alfonso is the Bourbon whom the French Legitimists consider to be the &quot;de jure&quot; king of France under the name &quot;Louis XX&quot;. A 1987 attempt by the Orléanist heir (and other Bourbons, none of the elder branch) to contest Louis-Alphonse&#x27;s use of the Anjou title and to deny him use of the plain coat of arms of France was dismissed by the French courts in March 1989 for lack of jurisdiction (the courts did not address the merits of the claims). He is a French citizen through his paternal grandmother and is generally recognised as the senior legitimate representative of the House of Capet.

== Dynastic arguments ==

Legitimists consider the valid rationale for restoration and the order of succession to the French throne derives from fundamental laws of the Ancien Régime, which were formed in the early centuries of the Capetian monarchy.

According to these rules, monarchy is the basic form of government and the monarch the indispensable executive of government, succession to the throne being hereditary and passing by Salic primogeniture. Thus, females and any male who is not the (i.e. the legitimate eldest descendant of the most senior Capetian line) are excluded from the throne. The king must also be Catholic.

Other tenets of the Legitimist position are the following:
* Continuity (or immediacy) of the crown as upon the death of a monarch his heir automatically and immediately becomes king without the need of any formal act of investiture and even if political circumstances would not allow him to actually take power.
* Unavailability (or inalienability) of the crown as it is not the personal property of the king, therefore nobody, not even the king himself, can alter the line of succession by abdication, renunciation, or appointment of an heir of his own choosing. This argument is crucial for Legitimists regarding the continuing validity of the rights of succession of the Spanish line of Philip V and his descendants. According to this view, Philip&#x27;s renunciation of his rights of succession to the French throne in the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 was null and void and therefore his descendants still retain their claim to the French throne ahead of the Orléans line.

It has been a point of contention within the Legitimist camp to what extent French nationality constitutes a precondition for royal succession. While adherents of the Spanish Anjou line argue that princes of foreign nationality can still succeed to the French crown, others hold that French nationality of both the claimant and his ancestors is a requirement.

== List of Legitimist claimants to the French throne ==
In the 1870s, the rival Legitimist and Orléanist claimants agreed for the sake of restoration of the monarchy in France to end their rivalry. Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Count of Paris and grandson of Louis Philippe I, accepted the prior claim to the throne of Chambord, who remained childless; Chambord in turn acknowledged that Philippe would claim the right to succeed him as heir, and after his death many Legitimists accepted the descendants of Philippe as the rightful pretenders and became known as Unionists.

Those Legitimists who did not accept the Orléanist line as the successors of Chambord argued that the renunciation of the French throne by Philip V of Spain, second grandson of Louis XIV, was invalid; in 1883 (when Chambord died childless), the throne passed by right to Philip V&#x27;s heirs in the male-line. In 1883, the senior male of the Spanish branch of Bourbons was Infante Juan, Count of Montizón. His father, Infante Carlos, Count of Molina (second son of Charles IV: grandson of Philip V), had lost Spain&#x27;s throne in favour of his niece, the non-Salic heiress of his elder brother, Isabella II and his lineage became known as the Carlist pretenders in Spain.

When the Carlist branch died out in 1936, the French claim was reunited with that of the Isabelline Spanish line through her grandson Alfonso XIII of Spain, who was also (officially) the grandson of her consort Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz (grandson Charles IV via his third son, Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain) and thus the most senior male-line descendant of Philip V (although by that time Alfonso had been dethroned by the Second Spanish Republic). The French and Spanish claims separated again at Alfonso&#x27;s death as his eldest surviving son Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia renounced his claim to the Spanish throne due to physical disability and some years later asserted a claim to the French succession based on Legitimist principles. The present French Legitimist claimant descends from Jaime while the present king of Spain descends from his younger brother Don Juan.

== Biography ==
Adleman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A photographer and tail gunner in the Army Air Forces during World War II, he became a businessman and a historian, and began a collaboration with U.S. Army Colonel George Walton to write books about World War II, the most successful of which was 1966&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade.&quot; A story about the 1st Special Service Force nicknamed the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, the book would be turned into a motion picture of the same name in 1968 and starred William Holden and Cliff Robertson.

Adleman was co-owner and president of Robinson, Adleman, and Montgomery, a Philadelphia public relations and advertising firm. An innovator, he constantly started new ventures including publishing of &quot;The Record-Breeze and Mall Journal newspapers; produced forerunner of &quot;Today&quot; TV show, &quot;Modern Living&quot;, and chain of fast food restaurants, &quot;Take Out Kitchens&quot; and &quot;Hush Puppy House.&quot; He also owned the Bessie V.

<text>The Carolinas, also known simply as Carolina, are the U.S. states of North Carolina and South Carolina considered collectively. They are bordered by Virginia to the north, Tennessee to the west, and Georgia to the southwest. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east.

Combining North Carolina&#x27;s population of 10,439,388 and South Carolina&#x27;s of 5,118,425, the Carolinas have a collective population of 15,557,813 as of 2020. If the Carolinas were a single state of the United States, it would be the fifth-most populous state, behind California, Texas, Florida, and New York.

The Carolinas were known as the Province of Carolina during America&#x27;s early colonial period, from 1663 to 1712. Prior to that, the land was considered part of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia, from 1609 to 1663. The province was named &quot;Carolina&quot; to honor King Charles I of England. Carolina is taken from the Latin word for &quot;Charles&quot;, &quot;Carolus&quot;.

==History==

The region was claimed as part of the Spanish territory named &quot;La Florida&quot; by Ponce de Leon in 1513. Santa Elena, a Spanish settlement on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina, was the capital of La Florida from 1566 to 1587. It was founded by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, the first governor of Spanish Florida. There had been a number of earlier attempts to establish colonies in the area by both the Spanish and the French, who had been inspired by earlier accounts of the plentiful land of Chicora. Menéndez&#x27;s Santa Elena settlement shifted the focus of Spanish colonial efforts northward from St. Augustine, which had been established in 1565 to drive the French from their colony of Fort Caroline. Santa Elena was ultimately built at the site of the abandoned French outpost of Charlesfort, founded in 1562 by Jean Ribault.

The establishment of Santa Elena followed the destruction of the French Fort Caroline by Menéndez in 1565. The Spanish settlement housed a sizeable community, and became the base of operations for the Jesuits and military working in the northern zone of Spanish Florida. From this base the Spanish founded a number of other ephemeral forts as far inland as the Appalachian Mountains, but resistance from local Native American tribes and the lack of interest of Spain in the area, caused these to be abandoned, relocated or destroyed. Santa Elena was ultimately abandoned in 1587, with its survivors relocating to St. Augustine. The Spanish never pressed their colonial claims to the area again, focusing on other areas of the American continent. The territory was thereafter left to the native Americans until October 30, 1629, when Charles I granted a patent to his attorney-general, Sir Robert Heath, for the lands south of 36 degrees and north of 31 degrees, &quot;under the name, in honor of that king, of Carolana&quot;.&quot; &quot;Carolus&quot; is Latin for &#x27;Charles&#x27;. The charter was unrealized and later ruled invalid.

On March 24, 1663, Charles II issued a new charter to a group of eight English noblemen, granting them the land of Carolina, as a reward for their faithful support of his efforts to regain the throne of England. The eight were called &quot;Lords Proprietor&quot; or simply &quot;Proprietors&quot;. The 1663 charter granted the Lords Proprietor title to all of the land from the southern border of the Virginia Colony at 36 degrees north to 31 degrees north (along the coast of present-day Georgia). The establishment of separate colonies did not officially occur until 1729, when seven of the Lords Proprietors sold their interests in Carolina to the Crown, and both North Carolina and South Carolina became royal colonies.

In 1665, the charter was revised slightly, with the northerly boundary extended to 36 degrees 30 minutes north to include the lands of the Albemarle Settlements along the Albemarle Sound, which had been settled mainly by Virginians migrating south. Likewise, the southern boundary was moved south to 29 degrees north, just south of present-day Daytona Beach, Florida, which had the effect of including the existing Spanish settlement at St. Augustine, an unenforceable overreach of English power. The charter also granted all the land, between these northerly and southerly bounds, from the Atlantic Ocean, westward to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, an even more unenforceable overreach.

Between 1663 and 1729 there were many disagreements relating to defense, governance and the difference between the two differing agrarian styles employed by the inhabitants of the Colony of Virginia and that practiced by the planters arriving to Charles Town from the West Indies and Barbados.

In 1729 the Province of Carolina was divided when the descendants of seven of the eight Lords Proprietors sold their shares back to the Crown. Only the heirs of Sir George Carteret retained their original rights to what would become the Granville District. Both the Province of North Carolina and the Province of South Carolina became British Crown Colonies in 1729.

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), South Carolina was the first Southern state to secede from the Union, while North Carolina was the second to last state to secede. South Carolina was generally one of the strongest supporters of the Confederacy. The war began in Charleston, South Carolina, where cadets of the South Carolina Military Academy, known as The Citadel, fired the opening shots at the Union Ship &quot;Star of the West&quot;. North Carolina was also a key Confederate state, raising and supplying many regiments of soldiers to the Confederacy. At Gettysburg, one in four Confederate soldiers was from North Carolina, despite the fact that some North Carolinians (especially in the western part of the state) refused to support the Confederacy. North Carolina&#x27;s Civil War governor, Zebulon Vance, was an outspoken critic of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and frequently refused to obey Davis&#x27;s orders for reinforcements and supplies; Vance insisted the soldiers and supplies would be needed for North Carolina&#x27;s Confederate effort. However, during the seven days&#x27; battles, North Carolina did send large numbers of troops for the general aid of the South as a whole. The Carolinas were both instrumental in keeping the Confederacy alive, because of their deepwater ports in Wilmington and Charleston. These two cities were key in supplying Southern armies with weapons, clothing, and ammunition, and producing food and provisions for Southern civilians.

A Unionist presence would persist throughout North Carolina during the Civil War, with North Carolina forming its own Union Army regiments. In South Carolina, no Union Army regiments were formed due to a smaller unionist presence, although the Upstate region of the state was a haven for Confederate Army deserters and resisters, as they used the Upstate topography and traditional community relations to resist service in the Confederate ranks.

==Culture==
The culture of the Carolinas is a distinct subset of larger Southern culture. Notably, the coastal Carolinas region was settled by Europeans over a century before the inland regions of the South. There was a particular early influence of Caribbean culture, especially from the English colony of Barbados; from which came many of the early governors during the unified period.

Though the two states both make up part of the Southern United States, there are historically a number of differences in the settlement patterns, political development, and economic growth between North and South Carolina.

==Politics==
During most of the 20th century, South Carolina was a bastion of the &quot;solid Democratic South&quot; with almost no Republican officeholders, and the state frequently elected politicians who were outspoken supporters of racial segregation. North Carolina, while mostly Democratic, contained a large Republican minority – the state voted Republican in the presidential election of 1928 and elected several Republican congressmen, governors, and senators from 1868 to 1928 – and North Carolina was widely known as one of the more progressive Southern states on the issue of segregation and civil rights. In 1947, the journalist John Gunther wrote, &quot;that North Carolina is by a good deal the most progressive Southern state will, I imagine, be agreed to by almost everybody.&quot; On the other hand, he described South Carolina as &quot;one of the poorest American states, and probably one of the balkiest.&quot; In describing the differences between the two states, Gunther noted that, in 1947, divorce in North Carolina &quot;may be granted simply on the ground of absence of cohabitation; South Carolina is the one American state in which divorce is not possible.&quot;

Despite North Carolina being a swing state in presidential elections since the early 21st century, and South Carolina being one that reliably votes for Republican presidential candidates, they are technically the country&#x27;s two most politically similar states, according to a comparison of the states along a range of 19 variables performed by the statistician Nate Silver in 2008.

==Economy==
Historically, like much of the South, the Carolinas economy was one based around agriculture production. The predominance of certain crops would help influence the regional economy:
Like other [Southern] states, until after World War II, North Carolina remained primarily a region of small farms and factories heavily dependent on just a few labor-intensive crops, relying on sharecropping and tenancy, especially for black laborers. The Carolinas are distinct for their economic dependence on tobacco as well as on cotton and rice, and for their many small-scale furniture, textile, and tobacco factories.
These industries gave the Carolinas, particularly North Carolina, a more significant industrial base than most Southern states. As mechanization increased in farming, along with textiles, apparel, and furniture jobs shifting because of globalization, combined with the decline of the tobacco industry, many rural and small urban communities suffered economically. During the late 20th century, both states began to experience growth in the technological and banking sectors, bringing jobs, population growth, and new economic industries. These changes, as with earlier industrialization, were more pronounced in North Carolina, with South Carolina experiencing a slower rate of economic growth for several years.

Since the 1980s, North Carolina has emerged as a financial hub with Charlotte becoming the second-largest financial district in the United States after New York City. Charlotte is headquarters to several major publicly traded corporations such as Bank of America, Truist Financial, and the East Coast operations of Wells Fargo, and Centene Corporation, as well as six other Fortune 500 companies, including Lowe&#x27;s, Duke Energy, Nucor, Honeywell, Brighthouse Financial, and Sonic Automotive.

==Boundary between the states==

===Plotting the boundary===
According to the Prefatory Notes to Volume 5 of the &quot;Colonial Records of North Carolina&quot;, the process of determining the boundary between North and South Carolina began in 1720 &quot;when the purpose to erect a
third Province in Carolina, with Savannah for its northern boundary&quot; began. On 8 January 1730 an agreement between the two colonies said for the border &quot;to begin southwest of the Cape Fear River, and to be run at that parallel distance the whole course of said river;&quot; The next June Governor Robert Johnson of South Carolina said the border should start southwest of the source of the Cape Fear &quot;due west as far as the South Sea&quot;, unless the &quot;Waccamaw River lyes [sic] within of the Cape Fear river,&quot; which would make the Waccamaw the boundary. North Carolina agreed to this until the discovery that the Cape Fear headwaters were very close to Virginia, which would not have &quot;permitted any extension on the part of North Carolina to the westward.&quot; In 1732, Governor George Burrington of North Carolina stated in &quot;Timothy&#x27;s Southern Gazette&quot; that territory north of the Waccamaw was in North Carolina, to which Johnson replied that South Carolina claimed the land. Johnson also said that when the two met before the Board of Trade in London two years earlier, Burrington had &quot;insisted that the Waccamaw should be the boundary from its mouth to its head,&quot; while South Carolina agreed the border should be located from the mouth, not the source. Johnson said this was &quot;only a mistake in wording it.&quot;

Both Carolinas selected commissioners to survey the line between them. The plan called for the line to run northwest to 35 degrees latitude, unless the Pee Dee River was reached first, in which case it would run along the Pee Dee to 35 degrees north. Then the line would run west to Catawba town, though if the town were north of the line, the line was to run around Catawba to keep it in South Carolina.

In May 1735, the surveyors went from the Cape Fear westward along the coast. Then they turned northwest and marked the location with stakes. The surveyors agreed to meet again on September 18. However, only the North Carolina team returned at that time, extending the line northwest . The South Carolina team arrived in October and followed the previous line for only because they had not been paid. A deputy surveyor marked where the Pee Dee crossed the 35th parallel. An extension of the line in 1737 ran to a stake in a meadow. However, the stake placed at the endpoint of the survey was too far south.

In 1764, a second extension ran westward. In 1772, after making adjustments to keep the Catawba Indians in South Carolina, &quot;extended in a due west course from the confluence of the north and south forks of the Catawba River to Tryon Mountain.&quot; However, this extension was based on the erroneous position of the 1737 stake, removing from South Carolina. Joseph Caldwell, president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, found that the line west of the Pee Dee did not run along the 35th parallel, but to the south. However, the western part of the line ran far enough to the north to make up for the difference. West of this point the border was shifted to run north of the 35th parallel so that the total areas of the states would return to what was intended, although the accuracy of this part of the survey was marred by a magnetic anomaly in the Charlotte, North Carolina area.

North Carolina did not agree to the line of 1772 until 1813. A 1905 survey determined the border between Scotland County, North Carolina and Marlboro County, South Carolina. A 1928 survey decided the border between Horry County, South Carolina and Brunswick and Columbus counties in North Carolina.

===Recent history===
In the mid-1990s, Duke Power determined that the border between the Carolinas needed to be re-surveyed, as the company was selling and donating land in the Jocassee Gorge area, which included parts of both states. Also, with more people living outside cities, the precise boundaries of fire, tax, and school district lines needed to be known. This was especially a problem in the mountains, where people had previously lived in valleys, not on the ridges where the border was. A 15-year plan to re-establish the boundary began, using maps from the 1813–1815 survey and GPS technology. A few stone markers still read, &quot;NC/SC 1815 AD&quot; but other locations were marked with trees which no longer stand.

South Carolina had recently been involved in a costly legal battle with Georgia over a small number of islands in the Savannah River, and wanted to avoid the expense of a lawsuit regarding the North Carolina border, so the two states agreed in 1993 to cooperate in resurveying the border. The effort included using colonial-era maps to reconstruct the positions of trees marking the border that had long since died, and tracking down the original positions of stone markers that had been moved.

After 18 years and $980,000, it was predicted that the process of determining the border between the Carolinas would be complete in 2012. Financial problems delayed the last survey until October 2012, meaning the results were not expected to be known until Spring 2013. It was found that a gas station and 30 homes could change states. Lake Wylie Mini Market has been located in South Carolina, along U.S. Route 321, and the move to North Carolina would result in higher gas taxes and change laws on beer and fireworks. The state legislatures involved expect to pass laws alleviating the concerns those changing states would face.

The Joint Boundary Commission met in February 2014 in Monroe, North Carolina, to determine what actions still needed to be taken. The persons living in 50 homes that changed states would have to get driver&#x27;s licenses and register to vote in their new states. Legislative action could allow people to keep utilities, avoid back taxes to the new state, and continue in the same schools. Lake Wylie Minimarket could be grandfathered, or Congress could change the defined border at the store&#x27;s location, though the commission intended to avoid such an action. As of August 2014, the states were expected to pass legislation to mitigate many of the negative impacts to affected landowners.

On June 1, 2016, the South Carolina House of Representatives passed a bill setting the border. North Carolina&#x27;s Senate also passed a bill, which also had to clear the House. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory signed his state&#x27;s bill in June. Three families who actually lived in North Carolina had South Carolina addresses, and 16 South Carolina residents had believed they lived in North Carolina. On December 9, 2016, McCrory announced that he signed a four-page executive order formally defining the border between the two states based on the 20 years of work.

== Professional sports ==

The Carolinas have three professional sports teams in the Big Four major leagues: the Carolina Panthers of the NFL, the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA, and the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL. Supported by both states, the three teams are all based in NC, with two in Charlotte and the third in Raleigh.

Professional sports franchises in the Carolinas first formed during the late 20th century. The oldest pro team in the Carolinas, the NBA&#x27;s Charlotte Hornets, were established in 1988, while the youngest, Major League Soccer&#x27;s Charlotte FC, were established in 2019. The Hornets were known as the Bobcats from 2004 to 2014, and were renamed the Hornets again in May 2014, one season after the former New Orleans Hornets decided to rebrand themselves as the Pelicans. At that time, the Hornets also regained sole ownership of the pre-relocation history of the original Charlotte Hornets. The Hurricanes formed in 1971 as the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association. After the NHL-WHA merger in 1979, they joined the NHL as the Hartford Whalers until 1997 when they relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina. Currently, the Hurricanes are the most successful after their 2006 Stanley Cup championship marked the first professional sports title for the region. In 2019, a Major League Soccer team was awarded to Charlotte, and begin play in 2022.

Bank of America Stadium currently hosts three major sporting events, the Duke&#x27;s Mayo Bowl, the Belk Kickoff Game and the ACC Championship Game.

Charlotte Motor Speedway hosts three major NASCAR events, the Coca-Cola 600, the NASCAR All-Star Race, and the Bank of America Roval 400.

<text>John Hart (March 31, 1879 – April 7, 1957) was the 23rd premier of British Columbia, Canada, from December 9, 1941, to December 29, 1947.

==Biography==
John Hart was born in Mohill, County Leitrim, Ireland, the son of an Irish farmer who was also named John Hart. He came to Victoria in 1898.

Hart worked in the finance industry and founded his own firm in 1909. In 1908, he married Harriet McKay. He entered politics in the 1916 election, elected to the provincial legislature as a Liberal member from Victoria City. He served as minister of finance from 1917 to 1924, and from 1933 to 1946. Hart retired from politics to attend to his business from 1924 to 1933. At various times, he also served as Minister of Industries (1922 to 1924 and 1933 to 1937), Minister of Lands (1944), Minister of Public Works (1942) and Minister of Railways (1942).

Hart became premier following the 1941 election when Pattullo&#x27;s Liberals failed to win a majority. Unlike Pattullo, Hart was willing to form a coalition government with the Conservative Party. This allowed the Liberal-Conservative coalition to govern with a majority in order to block the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation from forming the government.

From 1941 to 1945, Hart governed at a time of wartime scarcity, when all major government projects were postponed. Hart&#x27;s coalition government was re-elected in the 1945 election by a decisive margin. In that contest, Liberals and Conservatives ran under the same banner for the first time in BC history.

After 1945, Hart undertook an ambitious program of rural electrification, hydroelectric and highway construction. Hart&#x27;s most significant projects were the construction of Highway 97 to northern British Columbia (which is named in his honour) and the re-launch of the Bridge River Power Project, which was the first major hydroelectric development in British Columbia. He established the BC Power Commission, a forerunner of BC Hydro, to provide power to smaller communities that were not serviced by private utilities.

In December 1947, he retired as both finance minister and premier. Hart was named speaker for the assembly in 1948. He did not seek reelection in 1949 and returned to business.

Hart was one of the few BC premiers who left office neither defeated nor under a cloud. He died in Victoria in 1957, aged 78 years, having led a distinguished life of public service. He is interred in the Royal Oak Burial Park in Saanich.

The 405 km John Hart Highway between Prince George and Dawson Creek is named for him, as is the Hart Highlands neighbourhood of Prince George and the John Hart Dam (Hydroelectric) in Campbell River.

<text>The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is an insectivorous mammal native to Central and South America. It is one of four living species of anteaters, of which it is the largest member. The only extant member of the genus Myrmecophaga, it is classified with sloths in the order Pilosa. This species is mostly terrestrial, in contrast to other living anteaters and sloths, which are arboreal or semiarboreal. The giant anteater is in length, with weights of for males and for females. It is recognizable by its elongated snout, bushy tail, long fore claws, and distinctively colored pelage.

The giant anteater is found in multiple habitats, including grassland and rainforest. It forages in open areas and rests in more forested habitats. It feeds primarily on ants and termites, using its fore claws to dig them up and its long, sticky tongue to collect them. Though giant anteaters live in overlapping home ranges, they are mostly solitary except during mother-offspring relationships, aggressive interactions between males, and when mating. Mother anteaters carry their offspring on their backs until weaning them.

The giant anteater is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Threats to its survival include habitat destruction, fire, and poaching for fur and bushmeat, although some anteaters inhabit protected areas. With its distinctive appearance and habits, the anteater has been featured in pre-Columbian myths and folktales, as well as modern popular culture.

==Taxonomy==
The giant anteater got its binomial name from Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its generic name, &quot;Myrmecophaga&quot;, and specific name, &quot;tridactyla&quot;, are both Greek, meaning &quot;anteater&quot; and &quot;three fingers&quot;, respectively. &quot;Myrmecophaga jubata&quot; was used as a synonym. Three subspecies have been suggested: &quot;M. t. tridactyla&quot; (Venezuela and the Guianas south to northern Argentina), &quot;M. t. centralis&quot; (Central America to northwestern Colombia and northern Ecuador), and &quot;M. t. artata&quot; (northeastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela). The giant anteater is grouped with the semiarboreal northern and southern tamanduas in the family Myrmecophagidae. Together with the family Cyclopedidae, whose only extant member is the arboreal silky anteater, the two families comprise the suborder Vermilingua.

Anteaters and sloths belong to order Pilosa and share superorder Xenarthra (cladogram below) with the Cingulata (whose only extant members are armadillos). The two orders of Xenarthra split 66 million years ago (Mya) during the Late Cretaceous epoch. Anteaters and sloths diverged around 55 Mya, between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. The lineages of &quot;Cyclopes&quot; and other extant anteaters split around 40 Mya in the Oligocene epoch, while the last common ancestor of &quot;Myrmecophaga&quot; and &quot;Tamandua&quot; existed 10 Mya in the Late Miocene subepoch. Though most of their evolutionary history, anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent. Following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 3 Mya, anteaters of all three extant genera invaded Central America as part of the Great American Interchange.

The fossil record for anteaters is generally sparse. Known fossils include the Pliocene genus &quot;Palaeomyrmidon&quot;, a close relative to the silky anteater, &quot;Protamandua&quot;, which is closer to the giant anteater and the tamanduas from the Miocene, and &quot;Neotamandua&quot;, which is believed have close affinities to &quot;Myrmecophaga&quot;. &quot;Protamandua&quot; was larger than the silky anteater, but smaller than a tamandua, while &quot;Neotamandua&quot; was larger, falling somewhere between a tamandua and a giant anteater. &quot;Protamandua&quot; did not appear to be specialized for walking or climbing, but it may have had a prehensile tail. &quot;Neotamandua&quot;, though, is unlikely to have had a prehensile tail and its feet were similar in form to both the tamanduas and the giant anteater. The species &quot;Neotamandua borealis&quot; was suggested to be an ancestor of the latter. Another member of the genus &quot;Myrmecophaga&quot; has been recovered from the Montehermosan Monte Hermoso Formation in Argentina and was described by Kraglievitch in 1934 as &quot;Nunezia caroloameghinoi&quot;. The species was reclassified as &quot;Myrmecophaga caroloameghinoi&quot; by S. E. Hirschfeld in 1976.

The giant anteater is the most terrestrial of the living anteater species; specialization for life on the ground appears to be a new trait in anteater evolution. The transition to life on the ground could have been aided by the expansion of open habitats such as savanna in South America and the abundance of native colonial insects, such as termites, that provided a larger potential food source. Both the giant anteater and the southern tamandua are well represented in the fossil record of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene.

== Characteristics==

The giant anteater can be identified by its large size, long, narrow muzzle, and long bushy tail. It has a total body length of . Males weigh and females weigh , making the giant anteater the biggest extant species in its suborder. The head of the giant anteater, at long, is particularly elongated, even when compared to other anteaters. Its cylindrical snout takes up most of its head. Its eyes, ears and mouth are relatively small. It has poor eyesight, but has a powerful sense of smell; 40 times that of a human. While there is some difference in size and shape between the sexes, males being larger and more robust, telling them apart from a distance can be difficult. The male&#x27;s genitals are located within its body and upon closer examination, its urogenital opening is smaller and farther from the anus than the female&#x27;s. The female&#x27;s two mammary glands are located between the front legs.

Even for an anteater, the neck is especially thick compared to the back of the head, and a small hump protrudes behind the neck. The coat is mostly greyish, brown or black with mottled white. They have white front legs with black ringed wrists and hands, and dark hind legs. From the throat to the shoulders is a thick black mark with white outlines and sharp tips. The body ends in a brown tail. The coat hairs are long, especially on the tail, which makes the appendage look larger than it actually is. An erect mane stretches along the back. The bold pattern was thought to be disruptive camouflage, but a 2009 study suggests it is warning coloration.

The giant anteater has broad ribs. It has five toes on each foot. Three toes on the front feet have claws, which are particularly large on the third digits. It walks on its front knuckles similar to gorillas and chimpanzees. This allows the giant anteater to walk without scraping its claws on the ground. The middle digits, which support most of its weight, have long metacarpophalangeal joints and bent interphalangeal joints. Unlike the front feet, the hind feet have short claws on all five toes and walk plantigrade. As a &quot;hook-and-pull&quot; digger, the giant anteater has a large supraspinous fossa which gives the teres major more leverage—increasing the front limbs&#x27; pulling power—and the triceps muscle helps control the thickened middle digit.

The giant anteater has a low body temperature for a mammal, about , a few degrees lower than a typical mammalian temperature of . Xenarthrans in general tend to have lower metabolic rates than most other mammals, a trend thought to correlate with their dietary specializations and low mobility.

=== Feeding anatomy ===

The giant anteater has no teeth and is capable of very limited jaw movement. It relies on the rotation of the two halves of its lower jaw, held together by a ligament connecting the rami, to open and close its mouth. This is accomplished by its chewing muscles, which are relatively underdeveloped. Jaw depression creates an oral opening large enough for the slender tongue to flick out. It has a length of around and is more triangular in the back but becomes more rounded towards the front and ends in a rounded tip. The tongue has backward-curving papillae and is extremely moist due to the large salivary glands.

The tongue can only move forwards and backwards due to the tiny mouth and shape of the snout. During feeding, the animal relies on the direction of its head for aim. When fully extended, the tongue reaches , and can move in and out around 160 times per minute (nearly three times per second). A unique sternoglossus muscle, a combination of the sternohyoid and the hyoglossus, anchors the tongue directly to the sternum. The hyoid apparatus is large, V-shaped and flexible, and supports the tongue as it moves. The buccinator muscles loosen and tighten, allowing food in and preventing it from falling out. When retracted, the tongue is held in the oropharynx, preventing it from blocking respiration.

The anteater presses its tongue against its palate to smash the insects for swallowing. Unlike other mammals, giant anteaters swallow almost constantly when feeding. The giant anteater&#x27;s stomach, similar to a bird&#x27;s gizzard, has hardened folds to crush food, assisted by some sand and soil. The giant anteater cannot produce stomach acid of its own, but digests using the formic acid of its prey.

== Distribution and status ==

The giant anteater is native to Central and South America; its known range stretches from Honduras to Bolivia and northern Argentina, and fossil remains have been found as far north as northwestern Sonora, Mexico. It is largely absent from the Andes and has been fully extirpated in Uruguay, Belize, El Salvador, and Guatemala, as well as in parts of Costa Rica, Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The species can live in both tropical rainforests and arid shrublands, provided enough prey is present to sustain it.

The species is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, due to the number of regional extirpations, and under Appendix II by CITES, tightly restricting international trade in specimens. By 2014, the total population declined more than 30 percent &quot;over the last three generations&quot;. In 1994, some 340 giant anteaters died due to wildfires at Emas National Park in Brazil. The animal is particularly vulnerable to fires as its coat can easily catch ablaze and it is too slow to escape.

Human-induced threats include collision with vehicles, attacks by dogs and destruction of habitat. One study of anteater mortality along roads found that they are likely to be struck on linear roads near native plants. A 2018 study in Brazil found that: (1) roads were more likely to be detrimental to anteaters because of habitat fragmentation rather than vehicle accidents, (2) 18–20% of satisfactory anteater habitat did not reach minimum patch size (3) 0.1–1% of its range had dangerously high road density, (4) 32–36% of the anteater&#x27;s distribution represented critical areas for its survival and (5) more conservation opportunities existed in the north of the country. A 2020 study in the Brazilian &quot;cerrado&quot; found that road mortality can cut population growth by 50 percent at the local level.

The giant anteater is commonly hunted in Bolivia, both as a trophy and food. The animal&#x27;s thick, leathery hide is used to make horse-riding equipment in the Chaco. In Venezuela, it is slain for its claws. Giant anteaters are also killed for their perceived danger, particularly during threat displays. The biggest ecological strengths of the species is its wide range and adaptability. The Amazon, Pantanal and the &quot;cerrado&quot; have various protected areas where the anteater finds refuge. In Argentina, some local governments list it as national heritage species, affording it official protection.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Despite its iconic status, the giant anteater is little studied in the wild and research has been limited to certain areas. The species may use multiple habitats. A 2007 study of giant anteaters in the Brazilian Pantanal found that the animals move and forage in open areas and rest in forest; the latter provide shade when the temperature rises and retain heat when the temperature drops. Anteaters may travel an average of per day. Giant anteaters can be either diurnal or nocturnal. A 2006 study in the Pantanal found them to be mostly nocturnal when it is warm, but became more active in daylight hours as the temperature dropped. Diurnal giant anteaters have been observed at Serra da Canastra. Nocturnality in anteaters may be a response to human disturbances.

Giant anteaters prefer dense brush to sleep in, but when it gets cooler, they may use tall grass. When they need to rest, they carve a shallow cavity in the ground. The animal sleeps curled up with its bushy tail over its body; both to keep it warm and camouflage it from predators. One anteater was recorded sleeping flat on its side with the tail unfolded on a morning; possibly to allow its body to absorb the sun&#x27;s rays for warmth. Giant anteaters sometimes enter water to bathe and even swim across wide rivers. They are also able to climb and have been recorded ascending both termite mounds and trees while foraging. One individual was observed attempting to climb a tree by rearing up and grabbing onto a branch above it.

=== Spacing ===

Giant anteater home ranges vary in size depending on the location, ranging as small as in Serra da Canastra National Park, Brazil, to as large as in Iberá Natural Reserve, Argentina. Individuals mostly live alone, aside from young who stay with their mothers. Anteaters keep in contact with secretions from their anal glands and tree markings. They appear to be able to recognize each other&#x27;s saliva by scent.

Females are more tolerant of each other than males are, and thus are more likely to be found closer together. Males are more likely to engage in agonistic behaviors, which start with the combatants approaching and circling each other while uttering a &quot;harrr&quot; noise. This can escalate into chasing and actual fighting. Combat includes wrestling and slashing with the claws. Fighting anteaters may emit roars or bellows. Males are possibly territorial.

=== Foraging ===

This animal is an insectivore, feeding mostly on ants or termites. In areas that experience regular flooding, like the Pantanal and the Venezuelan-Colombian Llanos, anteaters mainly feed on ants, which are more numerous. Conversely, termites are more numerous in the grasslands of Emas National Park and hence are a more important food source for anteaters there. At Serra da Canastra, during the wet season (October to March) anteaters eat mainly ants, while during the dry season (May to September) they switch to termites.

Anteaters track prey by their scent. After finding a nest, the animal tears it open with its claws and inserts its long, sticky tongue to collect its prey (which includes eggs, larvae and adult insects). An anteater attacks up to 200 nests in one day, for as long as a minute each, and consumes a total of around 35,000 insects. The anteater may be driven away from a nest by the chemical or biting attacks of soldiers. Termites may rely on their fortified mounds for protection or use an underground tunnel system to escape.

Other prey include the larvae of beetles and western honey bees. Anteaters may target termite mounds with bee hives. Captive anteaters are fed mixtures of milk and eggs as well as mealworms and ground beef. To drink, an anteater may dig for water when none at the surface is available, creating waterholes for other animals.

=== Reproduction and parenting ===

Giant anteaters mate all year. A male trails an estrous female, who then partially raises her tail. Courting pairs are known to share the same insect nest during feeding. Mating involves the female laying sideways and the male hunching over. A couple may stay together for up to three days and mate multiple times during that period. Giant anteater have a 170–190 day gestation period which ends with the birth of a single pup. There is some evidence that the species can experience delayed implantation. Females give birth standing upright. 

Pups are born weighing with eyes closed for the first six days. The mother carries its dependent young on its back. The pup camouflages against its mother by aligning its black and white band with hers. The mother grooms and nurses her young, which communicates with her using sharp whistles. After three months, grooming declines and the young starts to eat more solid food. Both grooming and nursing bouts end at 10 months, which is also when the young leaves its mother. They are sexually mature in 2.5–4 years.

===Mortality===
Giant anteaters may live around 15 years in the wild, but can live twice that in captivity. The adult giant anteater has few predators. Adults are hunted only by jaguars and pumas. They typically flee from danger by galloping, but if cornered, will rear up on their hind legs and attack with the claws. The front claws of the giant anteater are formidable weapons, capable of potentially killing a jaguar. The giant anteater is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasites &quot;Gigantorhynchus echinodiscus&quot; and &quot;Moniliformis monoechinus&quot;.

== Interactions with humans ==
===Attacks===
Although they are usually not a threat to humans, giant anteaters can inflict severe wounds with their front claws. Between 2010 and 2012, two hunters were killed by giant anteaters in Brazil; in both cases, the attacks appeared to be defensive behaviors. In April 2007, an anteater at the Florencio Varela Zoo slashed and killed a zookeeper with its front claws.

=== In culture ===

In the mythology and folklore of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon Basin, the giant anteater is depicted as both a trickster and a comical figure due to its appearance. In one Shipib tale, an anteater stole a jaguar&#x27;s coat after challenging it to a diving contest and left the jaguar with its own pelt. In a Yarabara myth, the evil ogre Ucara is punished by the sun and turned into an anteater so he will have been unable to speak with his long snout and small mouth. The Kayapo people wear masks of various animals and spirits, including the anteater, during naming and initiation ceremonies. They believe women who touched anteater masks or men who fall while wearing them would die or be disabled.

During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the giant anteater was among the native fauna taken to Europe for display. It was popularly thought that there were only female anteaters and they reproduced with their noses, a misconception corrected by naturalist Félix de Azara. In the 20th century, Salvador Dalí wrote imaginatively that the giant anteater &quot;reaches sizes bigger than the horse, possesses enormous ferocity, has exceptional muscle power, is a terrifying animal.&quot; Dalí depicted an anteater in the style of &quot;The Great Masturbator&quot;. It was used as a bookplate for André Breton, who compared the temptations a man experiences in life to what &quot;the tongue of the anteater must offer to the ant.&quot;

The 1940 Max Fleischer cartoon &quot;Ants in the Plants&quot; features a colony of ants fighting off a villainous anteater. It may have been a commentary on France&#x27;s Maginot Line during the Phoney War. An anteater is also a character in the comic strip &quot;B.C.&quot; This character was the inspiration for Peter the Anteater, the University of California, Irvine team mascot. In the Stephen King miniseries &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot;, the character Antubis appears in the form of an anteater-like creature with razor-sharp teeth.

<doc id="340169" wikidata="Q334836" url="?curid=340169" title="Sing Buri province">
<text>Sing Buri (, ) is one of the central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Nakhon Sawan, Lopburi, Ang Thong, Suphan Buri, and Chai Nat.

==Toponymy==
The word &quot;sing&quot; originates from Sanskrit &quot;singh&quot; meaning &#x27;lion&#x27; and &quot;buri&quot;, from Sanskrit &quot;puri&quot; meaning &quot;buri mueang&quot; &#x27;fortified city&#x27; or &#x27;town&#x27;. Hence the literal translation is &#x27;lion city&#x27;, sharing the same root as Singapore.

==Geography==
Sing Buri is located on the flat river plain of the Chao Phraya River valley. Eighty percent of the areas are wide flat areas, of which the soil is suitable for agriculture. There are a small number of slopes in swamps of different sizes. The highest average height of the area is 17 meter above sea level. Floods will occur during the rainy season. The total forest area is or 0.5 per mille of provincial area.

==Climate==
Sing Buri province has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification category Aw). Winters are dry and warm. Temperatures rise until May. The monsoon season runs from May through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm. Climate statistics: the maximum temperature is 41.4 °C (106.5 °F) in April and the lowest temperature is 10.2 °C (50.4 °F) in December. The highest average temperature is 36.8 °C (98.2 °F) and the minimum average temperature is 20.6 °C (69.1 °F). Annual average rainfall is 1,125 millimeters with mean rainy days is 17.6 in September. Maximum daily rainfall is 203.4 millimeters in October.

==History==
The area of Sing Buri held an important position in early Thai history from the Dvaravati period down to the Ayutthaya period. The city was originally on the banks of the Chaksi River. The first relocation was to the west of the Noi River (south of Sing Sutthara Temple) and later moved to Pak Bang Krathong, Ton Pho subdistrict. In 1869 the districts In Buri, Phrom Buri and Sing Buri were merged. In 1895 the three districts came under control of Krung Kao province (&quot;Old capital&quot;), monthon Krung Kao. In 1896 the city was moved to its final destination in Bang Phutsa subdistrict. In 1917 Mueang district changed its name to Bang Phutsa district. In 1938 the government changed the name of the capital district to be the same as the name of the province. So Bang Phutsa district uses the name Mueang Sing Buri until today. In 1939 Sing district was renamed Bang Rachan district.

==Symbols==

The provincial seal presents the history of Khai Bang Rachan. When the Burmese attacked Ayutthaya in 1765, 11 leaders with villagers from Bang Rachan fought the army when it stopped north of Ayutthaya. They managed to delay them for five months before they were finally defeated, soon thereafter Ayutthaya fell as well. Annually on 4 February a ceremony is held in remembrance of these local heroes. This story was also made into a movie in Thailand.
* Old seal was created in 1940, shows the fort Khai Bang Rachan.
* New seal was adopted in 2004, shows the eleven leaders who fought the Burmese.

The provincial tree is the Red Sandalwood Tree (&quot;Adenanthera pavonina&quot;). &quot;Pla chon mae la&quot; (Mae la snakehead fish) is the native snakehead fish variety that originated in the Lam Mae La, an long branch of the Chao Phraya River that flows through the three districts of Sing buri. This type of snakehead is an ingredient that can be used in a variety of dishes, both savory and sweet. It is the provincial good stuff and souvenir. Therefore, the aquatic life of Sing Buri is the snakehead fish (&quot;Channa strita&quot;).

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into six districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further subdivided into 45 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 364 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Sing Buri Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 8 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Sing Buri and Bang Rachan have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 6 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 33 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="340172" wikidata="Q2576656" url="?curid=340172" title="Mysians">
<text>Mysians (; , &quot;Mysoí&quot;) were the inhabitants of Mysia, a region in northwestern Asia Minor.

==Origins according to ancient authors==
Their first mention is by Homer, in his list of Trojans allies in the Iliad, and according to whom the Mysians fought in the Trojan War on the side of Troy, under the command of Chromis and Ennomus the Augur, and were &quot;lion-hearted spearmen who fought with their bare hands&quot;.

Herodotus in his &quot;Histories&quot; wrote that the Mysians were brethren of the Carians and the Lydians, originally Lydian colonists in their country, and as such, they had the right to worship alongside their relative nations in the sanctuary dedicated to the Carian Zeus in Mylasa. He also mentions a movement of Mysians and associated peoples from Asia into Europe still earlier than the Trojan War, wherein the Mysians and Teucrians had crossed the Bosphorus into Europe and, after conquering all of Thrace, pressed forward till they came to the Ionian Sea, while southward they reached as far as the river Peneus. Herodotus adds an account and description of later Mysians who fought in Darius&#x27; army.

Strabo in his Geographica informs that, according to his sources, the Mysians in accordance with their religion abstained from eating any living thing, including from their flocks, and that they used as food honey and milk and cheese. Citing the historian Xanthus, he also reports that the name of the people was derived from the Lydian name for the oxya tree.

==Mysian language==
Little is known about the Mysian language. Strabo noted that their language was, in a way, a mixture of the Lydian and Phrygian languages. As such, the Mysian language could be a language of the Anatolian group. However, a passage in Athenaeus suggests that the Mysian language was akin to the barely attested Paeonian language of Paeonia, north of Macedon.

A short inscription which could be in Mysian and which dates from between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC was found in &quot;Üyücek&quot;, near Kütahya, and seems to include Indo-European words, but it has not been deciphered.

<doc id="340174" wikidata="Q372361" url="?curid=340174" title="Prusias I of Bithynia">
<text>Prusias I Cholus (; c. 243 – 182 BC) was a king of Bithynia, who reigned from c. 228 to 182 BC.

==Life and Reign==

Prusias was a vigorous and energetic leader; he fought a war against Byzantium (220 BC), seizing its Asiatic territory, a part of Mysia that had been in its possession for a long time. Then, Prusias defeated the Galatians who Nicomedes I had invited across the Bosphorus to a territory called Arisba, putting to death all of their women and children and letting his men plunder their baggage.

At some point during his reign, Prusias formed a marriage alliance with Demetrius II of Macedon, receiving the latter&#x27;s daughter, Apama, as his wife.

Prusias expanded the territories of Bithynia in a series of wars against Attalus I of Pergamum and Heraclea Pontica on the Black Sea, taking various cities formerly owned by the Heracleans, renaming one of them, Prusias, after himself. While besieging the city of Heraclea Pontica, Prusias dealt many casualties to the besieged. While climbing a ladder, he was hit with a stone and he broke his leg; the siege was lifted due to his injury. This is likely where he was given the surname &quot;the lame&quot;. Philip V of Macedon granted him the ports of Keios and Myrleia in 202 BC, which he renamed Prusias and Apameia respectively. Although he granted sanctuary to Hannibal, who successfully employed an odd stratagem against the Attalids for him at sea, he remained neutral during the Roman Republic&#x27;s war with Antiochus III the Great, refusing an alliance with Antiochus. He agreed on peace terms with presumably Eumenes II in 183 BC, in the city of Cyzicus. Apama bore Prusias I a son called Prusias II, who succeeded him.

The town of Prusa (now Bursa in Turkey), which he rebuilt, is named after Prusias.

<text>Prusias II Cynegus (Greek: Προυσίας ὁ Κυνηγός; &quot;the Hunter&quot;, c. 220 BC – 149 BC, reigned c. 182 BC – 149 BC) was the Greek king of Bithynia. He was the son and successor of Prusias I and Apama III.

==Life==
Prusias was born to Prusias I and Apama III in 220 BC. His father died in 189 BC, at which point he became the king of Bithynia. Prusias II joined with the king of Pergamon, Eumenes II in a war against King Pharnaces I of Pontus (181–179 BC). He later invaded the territories of Pergamon (156–154 BC), only to be defeated, with Pergamon insisting on heavy reparations, including 500 talents and &quot;twenty decked ships&quot;. 

Prusias II married his maternal cousin Apame IV, a sister of Perseus of Macedon and a princess from the Antigonid dynasty, by whom he had a son, Nicomedes II, and a daughter, Apama, who would marry Dyegilos, son of Cotys IV, King of Thrace, and his wife, Semestra. 

Prusias II was honoured by the Aetolian League with a stele at Delphi on account of his behavior and benefactions towards them.

Towards the end of his life, Prusias II had children by a later wife, and wanted to make them his heirs in place of Nicomedes. He sent Nicomedes to Rome to ask its help in reducing the amount of these reparations, and directed the co-ambassador, Menas, to kill Nicomedes if the mission was unsuccessful. Despite the failure of the mission, Nicomedes persuaded Menas to betray Prusias, and Nicomedes declared himself king. Prusias had to renounce the kingship in favour of his son and was himself murdered in 149 BC.

<text>The Streets of San Francisco is an American television crime drama filmed on location in San Francisco and produced by Quinn Martin, with the first season produced in association with Warner Bros. Television (QM produced the show on its own for the remainder of its run).

It starred Karl Malden and Michael Douglas as two homicide inspectors in San Francisco. The show ran for five seasons on ABC between 1972 and 1977, amassing a total of 119 60-minute episodes. Douglas left the series at the start of its final season, and was replaced by Richard Hatch.

The series started with a pilot movie of the same title (based on the 1972 detective novel &quot;Poor, Poor Ophelia&quot; by Carolyn Weston) a week before the series debuted. Edward Hume, who wrote the teleplay for the pilot, was credited as having developed the series based on characters in Weston&#x27;s novel. The pilot featured guest stars Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley, and Kim Darby.

==Production==

&quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; premiered on ABC on Saturday, September 16, 1972, at 9 pm Eastern, competing against the popular CBS sitcoms &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. After &quot;Streets&quot; gained attention on Saturday nights during the first season, the show was moved to Thursday, where it stayed for the remainder of its run, beginning with the second season, competing against other successful 1970s crime dramas, in different timeslots.

By all accounts, Malden and Douglas developed a strong professional and personal relationship from their time on the series. Twenty years after last working together on an episode, they were both onstage at the 1996 People&#x27;s Choice Awards. Malden referred to Douglas as &quot;the son I never had&quot; and mentioned that he had wanted producer Quinn Martin to cast Douglas on the series. Douglas responded to the compliment by calling Malden &quot;my mentor&quot;, and both expressed that they enjoyed working together on the show.

The show revolved around two police officers who investigated homicides in San Francisco. The center of the series was a veteran cop and widower, Lt. Michael Stone, star #897 (played by Malden), who had more than 20 years of police experience and was now assigned to the homicide detail of the San Francisco Police Department&#x27;s Bureau of Inspectors. He was partnered with a young inspector and energetic partner, Inspector Steve Keller, star #2248 (played by Douglas), a college graduate, aged 28, who had little experience on the police force. Stone became a second father to Keller as he learned the rigors and procedures of detective work. Eventually, Keller was promoted to full inspector. As the series progressed, Douglas became a star in his own right. Lt. Stone&#x27;s daughter, Jeannie Stone (played by Darleen Carr), made occasional appearances.

After the second episode of the fifth and final season, Douglas left the show after successfully producing the film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Film for 1975. He, in turn, also established a film career. His character&#x27;s absence was explained by having him take a teaching position at the University of California, located across the Bay in Berkeley, while Lt. Stone was partnered with another inspector, Inspector Dan Robbins (Richard Hatch).

Richard Hatch had started his career on the ABC soap &quot;All My Children&quot; and after this show stopped production, went on to &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. The change from Douglas to Hatch was not popular with audiences, and the show ended in 1977 due to declining ratings and increased production costs.

Additionally in 1977, writer James J. Sweeney won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his teleplay for the season-four episode &quot;Requiem for Murder&quot;.

The series was sponsored by Ford Motor Company, and half of the vehicles shown were new Ford cars. In the early episodes, Keller and Stone drove a brown 1971 Ford Galaxie four-door sedan and the entire SFPD cruiser fleet consisted of Ford Galaxies.

On January 27, 1992, a reunion TV movie entitled &quot;Back to the Streets of San Francisco&quot; was aired, but Douglas did not appear in it. However, Darleen Carr did return as Mike Stone&#x27;s daughter Jeannie.

==Broadcast history==
:Sep 1972 – Jan 1973: Sat at 9:00–10:00 ET
:Jan 1973 – Aug 1974: Thu at 10:00–11:00 ET
:Sep 1974 – Sep 1976: Thu at 9:00–10:00 ET
:Sep 1976 – Jun 1977: Thu at 10:00–11:00 ET

When the series debuted, it was slotted as counter programming opposite CBS&#x27; popular Saturday-night situation comedies, but failed to build an audience. The two-hour pilot movie ranked 58 out of 65 programs telecast that week, while the first regular episode of the series fared even lower at 62nd of 65 programs. In January 1973, ABC shook up its lineup by shuffling a number of its programs around. &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; moved to Thursday night, and immediately increased its viewership to an 18.1 rating and 31 percent share of the audience. Over the next three years, the series flourished on Thursday, ranking number 22 for its second and third seasons and number 26 for its fourth. For the 1976-77 television season, ABC made the strategic error of moving the show up one hour, placing it in direct competition with &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, another Quinn Martin production. The two crime dramas virtually split their audience with &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; ranking 49th and &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; falling to 52nd of 104 shows for the season. The decline in viewership, coupled with steadily rising production costs and a new contract for star Karl Malden, prompted ABC to cancel the series.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; debuted on November 19, 1973, on ITV.

<text>A United Free Will Baptist is a member of either of two African-American Free Will Baptist denominations: the United American Free Will Baptist Church or the United American Free Will Baptist Conference.

Free Will Baptists can be found in America as early as 1727, in connection with the labors of Paul Palmer in the Carolinas. Both slaves and free blacks became members of the predominantly white Free Will Baptist churches in the south. The first black minister ordained by the Free Will Baptists was Robert Tash, who was ordained by the General Conference in 1827 The first separate black congregation of Free Will Baptists was organized in North Carolina in 1867. The main strength of the two bodies remains on the eastern seaboard from North Carolina to Florida.

<doc id="340197" wikidata="Q48278" url="?curid=340197" title="Medellín">
<text>Medellín ( ; or ), officially the Special District of Science, Technology and Innovation of Medellín (), is the second-largest city in Colombia after Bogotá, and the capital of the department of Antioquia. It is located in the Aburrá Valley, a central region of the Andes Mountains, in northwestern South America. The city&#x27;s population was 2,508,452 at the 2018 census. The metro area of Medellín is the second-largest urban agglomeration in Colombia in terms of population and economy, with more than 4 million people.

In 1616, the Spaniard Francisco de Herrera Campuzano erected a small indigenous village (&quot;poblado&quot;) known as &quot;Saint Lawrence of Aburrá&quot; (&quot;San Lorenzo de Aburrá&quot;), located in the present-day El Poblado commune. On 2 November 1675, the queen consort Mariana of Austria founded the &quot;Town of Our Lady of Candelaria of Medellín&quot; (&quot;Villa de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Medellín&quot;) in the Aná region, which today corresponds to the center of the city (east-central zone) and first describes the region as &quot;Medellín&quot;. In 1826, the city was named the capital of the Department of Antioquia by the National Congress of the nascent Republic of Gran Colombia, comprising present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. After Colombia won its independence from Spain, Medellín became the capital of the Federal State of Antioquia until 1888, with the proclamation of the Colombian Constitution of 1886. During the 19th century, Medellín was a dynamic commercial center, first exporting gold, then producing and exporting coffee.

Towards the end of the 20th century and into the beginning of the 21st, the city regained industrial dynamism, with the construction of the Medellín Metro commuter rail, liberalized development policies and improvement in security and education. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have lauded the city as a pioneer of a post-Washington Consensus &quot;local development state&quot; model of economic development. The city is promoted internationally as a tourist destination and is considered a global city type &quot;Gamma +&quot; by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The Medellín Metropolitan Area produces 67% of the Department of Antioquia&#x27;s GDP and 11% of the economy of Colombia. Medellín is important to the region for its universities, academies, commerce, industry, science, health services, flower-growing, and festivals.

In February 2013, the Urban Land Institute chose Medellín as the most innovative city in the world due to its recent advances in politics, education, and social development. In the same year, Medellín won the Veronica Rudge Urbanism Award conferred by Harvard University to the Urban Development Enterprise, mainly due to the North-Western Integral Development Project in the city. Medellín hosted UN-Habitat&#x27;s 7th World Urban Forum in 2014. In 2016, the city won the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize. The award seeks to recognize and celebrate efforts in furthering innovation in urban solutions and sustainable urban development.

==Toponymy==
The valley and its Spanish settlement have gone by several names over the years, including &quot;Aburrá de los Yamesíes&quot;, &quot;Valley of Saint Bartholomew&quot;, &quot;Saint Lawrence of Aburrá&quot;, &quot;Saint Lawrence of Aná&quot;, &quot;Villa de la Candelaria de Medellín&quot;, and finally &quot;Medellín&quot;.

The name &quot;Medellín&quot; comes from Medellín, Spain, a small village in the Province of Badajoz in Extremadura. The village was the birthplace of Hernán Cortés. The Spanish Medellín, in turn, was originally called &quot;Metellinum&quot; and was named after Roman general Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius in 75 BC, who founded the village as a military base.

Some of the Conquistadors, such as Gaspar de Rodas, the first governor of Antioquia, came from Badajoz Province. Count Pedro Portocarrero y Luna, President of the Council for the West Indies (&quot;Consejo de Indias&quot;), asked the Monarchy of Spain to give the name of his town to the new settlement in America. His request was accepted on November 22, 1674, when queen regent Mariana of Austria proclaimed the city&#x27;s name to be &quot;Villa de Nuestra Señora de Medellín&quot;. Miguel Aguinaga y Mendiogoitia, Governor, made the name official on November 2, 1675. The Crown granted a coat of arms to the city on June 24, 1676.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian era and settlers===
In August 1541, Marshal Jorge Robledo was in the place known today as Heliconia when he saw in the distance what he thought was a valley. He sent Jerónimo Luis Tejelo to explore the territory, and during the night of August 23, Tejelo reached the plain of what is now Aburrá Valley. The Spaniards gave it the name of &quot;Valley of Saint Bartholomew&quot;, but this was soon changed for the native name &quot;Aburrá&quot; &quot;Painters&quot; because of the textile decorations of the local rulers.

In 1574, Gaspar de Rodas asked the Antioquia&#x27;s cabildo for of land to establish herds and a ranch in the valley. The Cabildo granted him of land.

In 1616, the colonial visitor Francisco de Herrera y Campuzano founded a settlement with 80 Amerindians, naming it &quot;Poblado de San Lorenzo&quot;, now El Poblado. In 1646, a colonial law on casta ordered the separation of Indigenous peoples (&quot;indios&quot;) from mestizos and mulattos. The colonial administration began the construction of a new town in Aná, today Berrío Park, where the church of &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Aná&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Candelaria of Aná&quot;) was built. Three years later, the Spaniards started the construction of the Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria, which was rebuilt at the end of the 18th century.

===Growth of the town===
After 1574, with Gaspar de Rodas settled in the valley, the population started to grow. According to the church records of the San Lorenzo Church, six couples married between 1646 and 1650, and 41 between 1671 and 1675. Gold mines were developed northeast of Antioquia, thus they needed food supply from nearby agriculture. The Aburrá Valley was in a strategic position between the gold mines and the first provincial capital of Antioquia, Santa Fe de Antioquia.

The provincial capital, Santa Fe, started to lose importance and gradually became poor, as trade and prominent personalities of the region came to the Aburrá Valley, where rich families started to buy land. Soon, the first settlers asked for the creation of a Cabildo (council) in the valley, thus getting a separate government from Santa Fe. The Santa Fe government fought this, but Mariana of Austria signed the edict creating the Cabildo on November 22, 1674. The governor Miguel de Aguinaga proclaimed the royal edict on 2 November 1675. The new city was given the title of &quot;Villa de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria&quot;.

===During the Spanish colonial period===
Before the creation of the town, the inhabitants were scattered throughout the valley, with only a few families concentrated at the confluence of the Aná (today called the Santa Elena) and the Medellín rivers; others lived in El Poblado San Lorenzo. After the royal edict, the settlers chose the Aná site as the heart of the future city, with the Candelaria Church at its center. 
Their first buildings were simple, with thatched roofs. The houses of the most important people were two stories tall, and the church and the Cabildo were unimpressive. It was only during the 18th century that the church was improved. Only one story, the Cabildo was located at the western part of the plaza. It had a thatched roof until 1742 when tiles were put on. In 1682, traders and foreigners started the construction of the Veracruz Hermitage, which was consecrated as a church by the Bishop of Popayán in 1712.

In 1675, the first census during colonial times was taken: there were 3,000 people and 280 families. Another census was not taken until the colonial Visitador (royal inspector) Antonio Mon y Velarde es ordered one between 1786 and 1787: there were then 14,507 people and 241 families. In 1808, two years before Colombia won independence, the city had 15,347 people and 360 families.

In 1803, the Royal College of the Franciscans was founded in the Central Plaza, which is Berrío Park today, with the initial departments of Grammar, Philosophy, and Theology. Soon after, the college moved to a new building in the small San Ignacio square. In 1821 it was renamed Colegio de Antioquia, and it became the University of Antioquia in 1901. The university also had the first vocational training school, the first cultural radio station in Latin America, and the first regional botanical garden.

===Industrial revolution===
In the first half of the twentieth century, the population of Medellín increased sixfold, from 59,815 inhabitants in 1905 to 358,189 in 1951. The Thousand Days War (1899–1902) stopped the industrial development of the city, although the civil war did not affect the region directly. Under reforms by President Rafael Reyes after the conflict, the city continued its industrial development and founded a Chamber of commerce. The Chamber developed a regional transport project that connected Medellín to other Colombian regions and other nations.

Despite the importance of gold production in the early development of Medellín, the export of coffee contributed the most impetus in the 20th century for the city&#x27;s growth. Trade grew to international dimensions as the main export of Colombia became coffee. The industrial and commercial dynamism of Medellín also created a caste of traders and entrepreneurs, who founded the first nationwide industries in Colombia.

===Trade in Medellín===

Coltejer is one of the most important textile companies in Colombia. It was founded in Medellín by Alejandro Echavarría on October 22, 1907. Its headquarters, the Coltejer Building, is the tallest skyscraper in Medellín and the fourth tallest building in Colombia.

The discovery of coal in Amagá, a few kilometers south of the Aburrá Valley, and the building of hydroelectric plants provided the new industries with energy, and this allowed the creation of many smaller companies. The Antioquia Railway (built in 1875) conquered the difficult geography of one of the most mountainous regions of South America, notably with the La Quiebra Tunnel, which connected the industrial center to the Magdalena River, the most major navigable river in Colombia. In 1932 Medellín also built its first airport, the Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport.

The study by Charles H. Savage on industrial production in Antioquia between 1960 and 1972 showed how important Medellín industries became to Colombia and South America. He studied social change produced by the introduction of new technology. Savage looked at three factories in Antioquia: two potteries in Santuario and La Blanca, and a tailoring factory in Medellín. Savage studied the production of the Antioquian factories, and the relationship between the workers and their employers, an industrial efficiency which he called the &quot;Culture of Work&quot;. His conclusions were published by his colleague George F. Lombardi as &quot;Sons of the Machine&quot; (1988).

===Art in the early 20th century===
Arts and literature have been an important social element in Medellín. The University of Antioquia, the National University of Colombia with its Medellín branch, and the Pontifical Bolivarian University have historically been the academic centers of the city and are responsible for the formation of an intellectual class in the region.

During the first part of the 20th century, the city was part of the literary transition from romanticism to the modern art and literary movements of the new century. The writer Tomás Carrasquilla (1858–1940) focused on the people of his native Antioquia, portraying their daily lives and customs. The writer and philosopher Fernando González from Envigado (in the metropolitan area of Medellín), the cartoonist Ricardo Rendón, and the poet León de Greiff were some of the founders of &quot;Los Panidas&quot;, a Medellín literary movement. Other featured poets and writers were Porfirio Barba-Jacob and Efe Gómez. In painting, the most famous were Eladio Vélez and Pedro Nel Gómez. Carlos Vieco Ortiz was a popular composer and musician. Medellín became the headquarters of record labels like Sonolux, Ondina, and Silver.

Medellín clubs, many of them dating to the end of the 19th century, became a center for intellectual and industrialist movements, like Club Union (founded in 1894) and Club Campestre (founded in 1924). In 1909, the Circo España was created, and Bolívar Theater in 1919. The &quot;art nouveau&quot; Junín Theater was demolished to build the Coltejer Tower, now the tallest building in the city. Cine Colombia, the first movie distributor of the country, was founded in Medellín in 1927.

===Growth in the second half of the 20th century===

Colombia entered a new era of political instability with the murder of presidential candidate Jorge Eliecer Gaitán in Bogotá in 1948. Political violence spread in the rural areas of Colombia, and farmers fled to the cities. The Valley slopes became overpopulated with slums.

As the population of Medellín grew quickly during the 1950s, industrialists, traders and local government created the &quot;Medellín Master Plan&quot; (MMP) (&quot;Plan Piloto&quot;), a plan for the expansion of the city into the Aburrá Valley that would lead to the creation of the first metropolitan area in Colombia. Paul Lester Wiener and José Luis Sert were the architects who led the project. Among the main features of the MMP were the canalization of the Medellín River, the control of new settlements on valley slopes, the creation of an industrial zone in the Guayabal District, the planning of the city to be in harmony with the river, the construction of a city stadium, and an administrative center in La Alpujarra. Little of the plan was actually done.

In 1951 the city had 358,189 inhabitants, but 22 years later, in 1973, the population had tripled to 1,071,252. The population explosion had several consequences for the MMP. The urban limits of the city grew to areas that were not contemplated in the MMP, so that Medellín now reached the urban areas of other cities of the Aburrá Valley, like Envigado, Bello and Itagüí; the new Medellín settlers were poor families without enough credit to buy their own homes, so several neighborhoods were built beyond the MMP; several old downtown buildings were demolished to construct tall towers, offices, and avenues.

In 1968 the Second Conference of CELAM was held in Medellín expressing a preferential option for the poor. The traditional Junin Theatre along the Santa Elena was demolished to build the Coltejer Tower. The huge migration into Medellín provided workers for the expansion of textile factories, being modernized in this period, but it also created new problems for the city: higher unemployment, lack of services for poor areas, urban violence in several districts, and collapse of any hope of a transport system. 

===Today===

The position of Medellín as an industrial city in Antioquia has been the main factor in overcoming its crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. The Medellín Metro, a massive urban transport service, became the pride of the city. The construction of the Plaza Mayor of Medellín, an international center for congresses and expositions, was designed to showcase the globalized economy of Colombia to the world.

Social exclusion has eased due to the development of a transport infrastructure; a new system of public buses called &quot;Metroplus&quot; opened in December 2011, and gondolas called &quot;MetroCable&quot;, which help connect the poorest barrio communities in the hills to the city, have been in operation since 2004, with more routes being added in recent years. Additionally, an electric escalator 1,260 feet long was inaugurated on December 26, 2011, in Comuna 13, one of Medellín&#x27;s poorest neighborhoods, making it one of the first of its kind in the world. Today&#x27;s Medellín includes spaces for art, poetry, drama, the construction of public libraries, the foundation of new ecological parks, and the inclusion of people of the city in its development.

In 2012, Medellín was among 200 cities around the world, including New York and Tel Aviv, nominated for Most Innovative City of the Year due to a great advancement in public transportation, with more than 500,000 residents and visitors using its Metro train system each day; a public bike-share program; new facilities and landmarks, including the España Library and a cultural center in Moravia; a large outdoor escalator the size of a 28-story building, enabling residents of the city&#x27;s elevated Comuna 13 neighborhood to safely ride down the steep hillside; and a Metro system which reduces Medellín&#x27;s CO2 emissions by 175,000 tons each year. Medellín has the biggest research-dedicated building in Colombia, called University Research Building (), a facility that concentrates the top research groups of the University of Antioquia.

==Geography==
Medellín has 16 &quot;comunas&quot; (districts), 5 &quot;corregimientos&quot; (townships), and 271 &quot;barrios&quot; (neighborhoods).
The metropolitan area of Medellín lies within the Aburrá valley at an elevation of above sea level and is bisected by the Medellín River (also called Porce), which flows northward. North of the valley are the towns of Bello, Copacabana, Girardota, and Barbosa. To the south of the valley lie Itagüí, Envigado, Sabaneta, La Estrella, and Caldas.

===Climate===
The weather in Medellín is warm year-round with few temperature extremes. As a municipality, Medellín has an area of . Medellín features a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;), albeit a cooler version of this climate that borders closely on a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;), as well as having characteristics of a tropical highland climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Since Medellín is located at above sea level, its climate is not as hot as other cities located at the same latitude near the equator. Because of its altitude above sea level and privileged location in the Andes Range, Medellín&#x27;s weather at times is more characteristic of a humid subtropical climate than that of a tropical climate. The city&#x27;s average annual temperature is , and because of its proximity to the equator, its temperature is constant year-round, with minimal temperature variations. Temperatures range from . Because of the former pleasant springlike climate all year, Medellín was known as &quot;La Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera&quot; or &quot;City of the Eternal Spring&quot;. The city is located in a valley and many of its districts are on slopes; temperatures can be slightly cooler on the surrounding mountains.

==Administrative divisions==
Medellín is a city governed by a republican democratic system as stated in the Colombian Constitution of 1991, with decentralized government. Administration is shared by the Mayor of Medellín and the Municipal Council, both elected by popular vote.

The municipality is made up of official departments (&quot;secretarías&quot;) including departments for social mobility, urban culture, social development, education, evaluation and control, government, resources, public works, administrative services, environment, women, and transportation. There are also many departments with a certain autonomy: the Olaya Herrera Airport, the Public Library (&quot;Biblioteca Pública Piloto&quot;), the College of Antioquia (&quot;Colegio Mayor&quot;), the Urban Development Enterprise (EDU), the Public Service Enterprise (EPM), the Sport and Recreation Institute (INDER), the General Enterprises of Medellín (EEVVM), the Medellín Bus stations, the General Hospital of Medellín, the health service enterprise &quot;Metrosalud&quot;, the Metropolitan Institute of Technology (ITM), the Metro de Medellín, the department for the Administration of the Medellín parks (Metroparques) and Metroseguridad.

The municipality is divided into six zones: The urban zone, which is subdivided into 16 &quot;comunas&quot; (communes). The communes are further divided into 249 statistical neighborhoods. The remaining zones outside the urban zones comprise five &quot;corregimientos&quot; (townships).

Further, the municipality belongs to the Medellín Metropolitan Area, which is made up of ten neighboring municipalities.

===Zones===

==Law and government==
The government of the city of Medellín is divided into executive and legislative branches. The mayor of the city (Alcalde) is publicly elected for a term of four years (just like the president and the governor of any other department in Colombia).

===Local development state===

Low tax rates mean Medellín&#x27;s city administration&#x27;s social and economic development policies have been funded by the city&#x27;s ownership of the main energy supplier, Empresas Publicas de Medellín (EPM); 30% of its profits go directly to the city&#x27;s administrative budget. In addition to infrastructure projects, the city administration has developed a program of cash grants called &#x27;the Medellín Solidaria&#x27; program that is very similar to Brazil&#x27;s highly successful Bolsa Familia and also the city runs the Cultura E program.

According to the city administration, Medellín Solidaria represents an improvement on Colombia&#x27;s national program, &#x27;Familias en Accion&#x27; (Families in Action). The city administration is further responsible for coordinating more than 100 other social programs. Under the Cultura E program, the city administration has established a network of 14 publicly funded business support centers known as CEDEZO, Centros de Desarrollo Empresarial Zonal). The CEDEZOs are found in the poorest areas of Medellín and support the poor in developing business by providing free-of-charge business support services and technical advice.

Also, as part of Cultura E, there is Banco de las Opportunidades that provides microloans (up to $2,500 at a cheap interest rate of 0.91% monthly). This has helped create more equal opportunities for all and overcome the barriers to entry to business for poor entrepreneurs with good ideas, but lacking capital, skills and connections. It has also helped develop the local economy with new micro-enterprises.

However, several mayoral candidates for the October 2011 elections have argued the Banco de las Opportunidades&#x27;s interest rates are too high, loan maturity is too short and it should have grace periods. They, therefore, suggest a new small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development bank to complement the Banco de las Opportunidades.

===Crime===

Medellín used to be considered one of the most dangerous cities in the world, a result of an urban war set off by the drug cartels at the end of the 1980s. However, its homicide rate has decreased by 95% and extreme poverty by 66%, thanks in part to a string of innovative mayors who laid out plans to integrate the poorest and most violent hillside neighborhoods into the city center in the valley below. Medellín is now considered safer than the US cities of Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit and New Orleans, which appear in the CCSPJP&#x27;s top 50 list.

As the home of the Medellín Cartel funded by Pablo Escobar, the city was a victim of the terror caused by the war between the organization headed by Escobar, and competing organizations such as &quot;El Cartel del Valle&quot;. However, after the death of Escobar in December 1993, crime rates in the city have decreased dramatically.

Throughout the rest of the 1990s crime rates remained relatively high, although gradually declining from the worst years. In October 2002, President Álvaro Uribe ordered the military to carry out &quot;Operation Orion&quot;, the objective of which was to disband the urban militias of the FARC and the AUC. Between 2003 and 2006 the demobilization of the remaining urban militias of the AUC was completed, with more than 3,000 armed men giving up their weapons.

After the disbanding of the main paramilitary groups, some members briefly reorganized into criminal bands known commonly as Aguilas Negras (&quot;Black Eagles&quot;). These groups gained notoriety in Medellín for having called for curfews for the underage population, and having distributed fliers announcing the social cleansing of prostitutes, drug addicts, and alcoholics. In 2008 the extradition of paramilitary leader Don Berna caused a brief spark in crime wave and increase in killings.

There is a significant disparity in crime rates by neighborhoods, with virtually no homicides in El Poblado and Conquistadores and higher crime rates in the south west, around the airport and the north of the city. Generally, crime rates increase the further the neighborhood is from the center. From 2010 and 2011, homicides have declined as with crime in general, but there remains a high crime rate in the poorest communities.

3.2 percent of street addresses account for 97 percent of homicides. More than half of the violent deaths are attributed to clashes between criminal gangs in certain parts of the city. In 1991 there were 7,273 murders at a rate of 266 per 100,000 people; in 2017 had suffered 577 murders at a rate of 23 per 100,000 inhabitants. In the city there are more than 1,100 security cameras and more than 7,000 policemen.

==Economy==

Medellín is Colombia&#x27;s second most important economic center, after Bogotá. Its economy is led by a powerful group of people from the private sector known as the Grupo Empresarial Antioqueño (Antioquian Enterprises Group). The group was formerly known as the &quot;Sindicato Antioqueño&quot; (Antioquian Union) but after being mistaken abroad for a labor union, which hampered its international growth for many years, a new formal name was chosen. It is represented by David Bojanini, head of Grupo Suramericana (a banking, asset management and insurance conglomerate); Carlos Ignacio Gallego of Grupo Nutresa (food industry); José Alberto Velez of Cementos Argos (a multinational cement company); and Carlos Raúl Yepes, head of Bancolombia. This group has an aggregate market capitalization of approximately US$17 billion and employs more than 80,000 Colombians.

This group also participates in other sectors of the city industry and is an active trader in the Colombian stock exchange. Medellín serves as headquarters for many national and multinational companies.

Medellín&#x27;s main economic products are steel, textiles, confections, food and beverage, agriculture (from its rural area), public services, chemical products, pharmaceuticals, refined oil, and flowers. Fashion is a major part of the economy and culture of the city. Medellín hosts Latin America&#x27;s biggest fashion show, Colombiamoda es

Aerolínea de Antioquia has its headquarters on the grounds of Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport in Medellín. West Caribbean Airways had its headquarters on the grounds of Olaya Herrera Airport. ACES Colombia was headquartered in the city. Viva Air, a Colombian low-cost airline, has its hub at Rionegro&#x27;s Airport.

===Gross domestic product===
The Metropolitan Area of Medellín contributes about 70% of the total GDP of the Department of Antioquia and a bit more than 10% of the economy of Colombia. Antioquia is the second-greatest economic region of Colombia. By 2005, Antioquia&#x27;s GDP was more than US$20,600,000,000 and the top exporting province in Colombia. The Aburrá Valley is the top economy in the department of Antioquia, and its GDP was US$14,500 million. Medellín is the second-largest economic region in Colombia, after Bogotá.

The 2005 Report of the Economic Colombian Review of Proexport and the International Cooperation Agency of Medellín concluded that Medellín was at the same level of GDP contribution to the national economy as cities like Panama City in Panama, and San José de Costa Rica.

===Medellín Cluster===
Medellín created the first Colombian business cluster. The city is the top exporting region of the country, with 1,750 export businesses based in Medellín. The Cluster was created with the support of the Chamber of Commerce of Medellín and the City Administration for an actual total of 21,000 companies that share 40% of total exports, 25% of the regional GDP, and 40% of Metro Area employment. The main economic activities of the Medellín Cluster (MC) are in electricity generation, textile, fashion design, construction, tourism and business. One goal of the Medellín Cluster is to include health services, an important sector in the local economy.

Ruta N is a non-profit in Medellín which helps foreign companies set up office in Medellín.

===Unemployment and poverty===
According to data released by the Measuring Monetary Poverty and Inequality Mission (Spanish: &quot;Misión para el Empalme de las Series de Empleo, Pobreza y Desigualdad&quot;, MESEP), in November 2009, the poverty rate in Medellín and its metropolitan area was reduced by 22.5%, from 49.7% to 38.5% during the period from 2002 to 2008. Similarly, the extreme poverty rate decreased by 25.2%, from 12.3% to 9.2%. These results are in line with the increased coverage of basic services such as health, education, and public services in the city. In 2014, the poverty rate decreased to 14.7% and extreme poverty to 2.8%.

The unemployment rate in Medellín and its metropolitan area, as has been the case in Colombia as a whole, has decreased in the past decade. According to data from the National Statistics Department (Spanish: Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística, DANE) unemployment for Medellín and its Metropolitan Area was reduced by 25%, from 14.1%, just above the national average of 13.9% in 2005 to 10.6%, above the national average of 9.9%, in 2015. However, according to DANE, in 2014 Medellín stood out as one of the most unequal cities of Colombia, with a GINI coefficient of 0.506.

==Urban development==
There are signs of heavy urban development within the city of Medellín, particularly with the construction of new skyscrapers. Medellín is outpacing all other major Colombian cities, including Bogotá, in the construction and proposed development of new high-rises. As of October 2016, there were 10 skyscrapers, 410 high-rises, 119 buildings under construction in Medellín, including 48 being planned. Other projects that the city has planned are extensions of the city&#x27;s metro system to nearby suburbs such as Sabaneta. Under construction, the new project is set to open to the public soon.

Medellín was awarded 2013 &quot;Innovative City of the Year&quot; by the Wall Street Journal on March 1 after beating out New York City and Tel Aviv.

===Libraries and library parks===

A &quot;library park&quot; () is a term first used in Medellín for an urban complex formed by a combination of a library building with ample surrounding green space for public use. These library parks are strategically located in the periphery of the city to address the need for more cultural and education space and public services in less affluent neighborhoods. The development of library complexes and schools is part of an effort at cultural transformation. This project also aims to create centralities inside the intervened areas that help consolidate and give a clearer identity to the communities. They are meant to provide a network of activity centers for the promotion of education, culture, sport, and recreation.
The initial plan in 2009 built five libraries with attached parks to serve underprivileged neighborhoods. This development included the Biblioteca Parque España designed by Giancarlo Mazzanti, and which was named after Spain, who helped fund the construction of one of its buildings. Architects of the other libraries added as part of the program include Ricardo La Rotta Caballero and Hiroshi Naito. The four other libraries added were León de Greiff Library (also known as La Ladera Library Park), San Javier Library Park, Bethlehem Library Park, and La Quintana Library Park.

After the initial 2009 program another five libraries were added to the plan for 2011. These libraries are the Doce de Octubre Library Park for Comunas 5 and 6, Noroccidente; Las Estancias Library Park for Comunas 8, 9, and Centroriental; Parque Biblioteca Guayabal for Comuna 15 and Suroccidente; Parque Biblioteca San Cristóbal] for Corregimiento and Occidente; and Parque Biblioteca San Antonio de Prado for Corregimiento and Sur.

The idea of &quot;library parks&quot; has served as a model for library spaces in other countries, most notably the Manguinhos Library Park in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The Medellín Metropolitan Area Library Network is a set of libraries linked together to share resources, efforts, knowledge and experience to improve the educational and cultural conditions of the community. The network consists of over 100 libraries, 29 of which reside in Medellín. The Library Network includes all of Medellín&#x27;s library parks, as well as other regional libraries, such as the Public Pilot Library and the EPM Library.

The Library Network was a program created as a metropolitan agreement in 2005 thanks to an alliance of Empresas Públicas de Medellín, its EPM Foundation, the Mayor of Medellín, and the Pilot Public Library. In 2009, the Library Network was awarded the &quot;Access to Learning Award&quot; by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, consisting of one million dollars to the EPM Foundation and the Library Network.

Additional libraries outside of this network include several other private, public, and university libraries.

===Architecture===

Medellín in 2013 won the Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design, awarded by Harvard University, due to PUI Integral Urban Project Northeast area, designed and implemented by Development Corporation Urbano. Medellín retains very little colonial architecture from the nineteenth century. Although the Aburrá Valley was a hotspot in agriculture and livestock throughout the colonial period, their relative wealth is not expressed in an outstanding and Cartagena, Tunja, Popayán and Bogotá civil and religious architecture. This can be explained by the fact that the population of Medellín was not political and administrative center and a place geographically isolated whose elite invested little in the development of monumental architecture. From the end of the colony remain, but with many transformations, the Candelaria Church and the Church of the Veracruz.

The architecture produced in Colombia between 1850 and 1930 is called &quot;Republican&quot;. The use of brick and implementation of European historical styles were the main novelty. Enrique Haeusler designed the Guayaquil Bridge in 1879. But it was the French architect Carlos Carré who headlined Republican nineteenth century architecture in Medellín. Carré came to town in 1889 and was hired to design and build the new Episcopal Cathedral and several commercial and residential buildings for different parts of the city, especially in the new neighborhood of Guayaquil. The Metropolitan Cathedral was completed in 1931; also are of authorship Vásquez and Carré buildings, which are located next to Plaza Cisneros. The Medellín Antioquia Railway Station was the work of Enrique Olarte, a work that allowed the definitive urban consolidation in Guayaquil sector. In the twenties Republican architecture reached its peak phase. In this period stand the old Municipal Palace (now the Museum of Antioquia) in 1928, the National Palace and the Palace of Departmental Government (now the Palace of Culture) between 1925 and 1928. The latter two works were designed by the Belgian architect Agustín Goovaerts, both inspired by the Belgian modernist, it applied the Romanesque and Gothic styles respectively. Other works of Goovaerts were the Church of the Sacred Heart (sector Guayaquil), the Church of San Ignacio, among others. The thirties highlighted such constructions of the Prado neighborhood as the Egyptian house and the current Teatro Prado.

===Parks===
The main parks of the city include Berrío Park in the center of the city; Bolívar Park, a little further north and framed by the Metropolitan Cathedral; and others in more residential areas like Bethlehem Park, El Poblado Park, and Laureles Park. Several modern parks are interactive and have had a positive reception from the people because they are not only places of recreation but also of education. These include Barefoot Park, Wishes Park, Explora Park, and Bicentennial Park (which was recently opened to mark the bicentenary of Colombia).

One of the most visited sites is the Arví Ecotourism Park, which has an area of about 20,000 hectares located between the towns of Medellín, Bello, Copacabana, and Envigado. In its trails, lakes, forests and streams, one can practice various sports and activities like trekking, kayaking, biking, camping, fishing, swimming, sailing rowing, horseback riding, bike tours and picnics. Its promontory position over Medellín offers natural landscapes overlooking over the entire city. 

The city is surrounded from above by seven hills, which serve as natural viewpoints of the city and are sites for healthy leisure, recreation, enjoyment, research, sport, culture, education and ecotourism. The hills are El Volador, La Asomadera, Nutibara, Pan de Azúcar, El Salvador, El Picacho and Santo Domingo. In these natural public spaces one can find viewpoints, pre-Hispanic roads, religious icons, culture and Antioquian traditions, bird watching, the most complete herbal living of Aburrá Valley and the very few, if any, remains of early settlers native of Medellín, among other attractions.

Other parks in the city include North Park and Juan Pablo II Park. The Santa Fe Zoo, founded in 1960, has about 1,000 animals from Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

===Plazas and plazuelas===

* Plaza Cisneros: Located between the EPM Library and the Vásquez and Carre Buildings. It has a forest of light poles, high. There are 300 posts with 2100 reflectors (seven per tower) and 170 lamps floor. These elements are mixed in turn with bamboo and water sources. It is a kind of artificial forest, with open spaces for encounters and large crowds.
* Botero Plaza: Launched in 2002, is located in front of the main façade of the Museum of Antioquia. It has , in which are exhibited permanently in the public space, 23 monumental sculptures by Fernando Botero. Attila addition to receiving the prize, awarded the magazine Documents National and American Architecture (Dana), of Argentina, and gave as winners of its 2003 Award Attila Medellín Mayor Luis Perez and former director of Heritage of the Ministry of Culture, Konrad Brunner, considering that they were directly responsible for the demolition of Pasaje Sucre, in Medellín.
* Zea Plazuela: Dates from the late nineteenth century and still has some houses with original architecture, also called the Square of Francisco Antonio Zea.

* Freedom Square: Located in the La Alpujarra, it is under construction and will have an area of and will include government and private agencies. It is designed as a public plaza open to recreation. It will be a center of convergence and coordination of the main activities and pedestrian flows that develop in the administrative and cultural sector of the city.
* Plazuela Nutibara: historical and representative of the city site. Its surroundings are located traditional buildings that have been listed as heritage of the city: the Palace of Culture, one of the most valuable architectural buildings; ancient seat of the government of Antioquia; and Nutibara Hotel.

* Plazuela de La Veracruz: Here is located the Church of La Veracruz which gives its name to the Plazuela. It has a bronze fountain and marble monument, a tribute to the hero of independence Atanasio Girardot.

==Health==

Medellín is considered a top research city in medicine in Colombia, being an exponent of advanced surgical operations in the country and Latin America. Health clinics and dental centers in Medellín have become pioneers in offering high quality services in several medical areas. The University Hospital San Vicente de Paul, the Pablo Tobon Uribe Hospital, and Clinical Cardiovascular Santa Maria have received national and international recognition as pioneers in organ transplantation.

América Economía magazine ranked Medellín as having eight of the top 100 hospitals and clinics in Latin America. Its highest ranked hospital was Pablo Tobon Uribe Hospital, which ranked in seventh place in 2014. The Pablo Tobon Uribe Hospital is non-profit and private.

Specialized health centers such as San Vicente Foundation hospitals were recognized with the Silver Category of LEED certification. This is the only hospital outside of the United States of America to obtain this certification.

Among the most recognized universities with notable research work in medicine are the University of Antioquia, CES University, and UPB University.

Air pollution caused more than 7,000 deaths in 2016 in the city and represents a significant financial cost due to the treatment of respiratory diseases.

==Education==

Medellín is also home to over 30 universities. Among the most important public universities are the following:

There are also important technological centers such as the Metropolitan Institute of Technology (ITM), Jaime Isaza Cadavid&#x27;s Politecnico, and Antioquia Institute of Technology.

During the last decade, the administration of the city has emphasized public education, building schools and libraries in poor quarters. Private schools and colleges have a long tradition in the city, many run by the Catholic Church, private organizations, and foreign institutions. Among them are Gimnasio Internacional de Medellín, The Columbus School (the only SACS-approved school in the city), Theodoro Hertzl School, St. Ignatius Loyola College, Colegio Calasanz, Colegio Colombo Britanico, El Corazonista School, Marymount School, Montemayor Sagrado Corazon, Montessori School, Colegio Fontán, Gimnasio Los Pinares, Gimnasio Los Alcázares, San Jose de la Salle, Instituto Jorge Robledo, the Salesian Technical School Pedro Justo Berrío, Colegio Cumbres, Colegio San Marcos, Lycee Français Medellín, Liceo Salazar y Herrera, and &#x27;El Sufragio&#x27; Salesian School.

Many non-governmental organizations and official organizations support the development of children and youth from poor communities. Ciudad Don Bosco cares for street children. The pacification of the city brought organizations to the poorest quarters to work with youth involved in urban violence, in order to improve their opportunities. Medellín universities, public and private, also played a role, along with official institutions both local and national.

==Transportation==

===Air transportation===
Medellín has two airports, Olaya Herrera Airport (EOH), and José María Córdova Airport (MDE), which is located in the city of Rionegro, east of the city of Medellín. In 2012 the busiest domestic flight route was between Jose Maria Cordova Airport and Bogotá while the busiest international route was between Jose Maria Cordova Airport and Panama City.

The Jose Maria Cordova Airport receives international flights from important carriers such as Aeromexico, American Airlines, Avianca, Iberia, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines, Air Europa, and LATAM Airlines and cargo airlines such as Fed Ex Express, which makes the city accessible from the many regions of America, both for passengers and cargo customers. Avianca, the flag air-carrier of Colombia, has also an important activity at this airport. This airport has direct flights to important international destinations such as Lima, Quito, Mexico City, Madrid, Miami, Houston, and New York City.

===Land transportation===
Medellín has two transportation terminals, the North Transportation Terminal and the South Transportation Terminal. The city&#x27;s public transport system includes diesel buses, taxis, tram and an urban train referred to as the Medellín Metro, the only metro system in Colombia.
The Metro connects the city with most of its metropolitan area. It has five lines. Line A goes from Niquía to La Estrella (north to south), while Line B goes from San Antonio to San Javier (downtown to west). In addition, Line K and Line J, an air cable car, locally known as Metrocable, serve a depressed and geographically difficult area. Line K begins at Acevedo Station on Metro Line A, and continues uphill, ending at Santo Domingo Savio. Line J begins at San Javier Station on Metro Line B, and continues uphill to La Aurora. Line L does not serve communal areas, rather, it is a tourist-oriented line which is connected to Arví Park and is part of a social project to bring retreats and nature to the masses. Colombia has become Latin America&#x27;s largest user of such complementary transportation service throughout the country.
In 2006, construction began on Metroplús, a bus rapid transit service with a dedicated road, much like Bogotá&#x27;s TransMilenio, to allow faster transit for the service&#x27;s buses. The first line opened two years later than planned in 2011 and a second in 2013. The first leg is the &quot;Troncal Medellín&quot;, which goes from the Universidad de Medellín in the west to Aranjuez in the northeast part of the city. Metroplus will help lessen the city&#x27;s pollution and traffic, as many old buses will be taken out of service, while the new buses will work with natural gas.
Because of its projects on sustainable transport, the city obtained, along with San Francisco, the 2012 Sustainable Transport Award, given by the Institute for Transport and Development Policy. According to EMBARQ Director Holger Dalkmann, &quot;Medellín pioneered the use of cable cars as a transit alternative in low-income informal settlements in hilly areas, moving 3,000 passengers per hour per direction; a real breakthrough now being replicated in Caracas and Rio de Janeiro,&quot;
The Colombia and Latin America&#x27;s second-largest and most modern tunnel, the Western Tunnel, officially named the Fernando Gomez Martinez Tunnel, is located between Medellín and Santa Fe de Antioquia. It is in length and offers security and service technologies for the users. It was inaugurated on January 20, 2006.

Originally, trams in Medellín were the most important transportation until 1950, but, after that, the rapidly increasing population and number of automobiles forcefully closed it in 1951. However, more than 60 years later, a new Translohr system (rubber-tired &quot;tram&quot;), the Ayacucho Tram, the first modern &quot;tram&quot; in Colombia, was opened on September 30, 2015. It is integrated with the metro system and the local bus network.

====Public transportation statistics====
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Medellín, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 66 min. 12% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 14% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.9 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

==Demographics==

The Aburrá Valley contains 58% of the population of the Department of Antioquia, and 67% of the Aburrá Valley population lives in the city of Medellín. Of the inhabitants of Medellín, 61.3% were born in the city, 38% in other parts of Colombia and 0.3% in another country.

According to the National Administrative Department of Statistics, Medellín had, by 2005, a population of 2,223,078 inhabitants, making it the second largest city in Colombia. The metropolitan area of Medellín in 2005 included 3,312,165 inhabitants. There are 5,820 people per square kilometer in the city. There were 130,031 people living in the city townships; 46.7% of the population are male and 53.3% are female. Illiteracy is 5.8% in people older than 5 years old. 98.8% of the households in Medellín have electricity, 97.3% have drinking water, and 91% have a land-line phone.

According to the 2005 DANE census, in that year Medellín registered 33,307 births, slightly fewer than in 2004 (33,615). In 2005 the number of deaths was 10,828, in 2004 11,512.
===Ethnicities===
According to figures submitted by the DANE census 2005, the ethnographic makeup of the city is:

* White/Mestizo : 93.4%
* Black, mulatto, Afro-Colombian or Afro-descendant: 6.5%
* Indigenous Amerindians: 0.1%

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Medellín received many immigrants from Spain. Most Indigenous peoples died from the introduction of Asiatic diseases, and many of those who survived intermarried with early Spanish settlers, who were mostly men; later, Spanish women also began to immigrate. Thousands of Irish, Scottish and English who settled in Antioquia fought for the Colombian army during independence. During the 19th and 20th centuries, immigrants arrived from Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria. Many people from Medellín are referred to as Paisas, people of mainly Spanish ancestry, a lot of them Basque. There is a small Afro-Colombian and Zambo-Colombian (people of Indigenous and African descent) population.

The Chocó Department is just west of Antioquia, and is home to many Afro-Colombian and Zambo-Colombian migrants to Medellín and its vicinity. Migration from the Colombian Caribbean coast has been important, especially that of young people who come to study in Medellín universities and remain to work in the city. The main foreign immigration is of Ecuadorians and Venezuelans in informal trade.

==Culture==
The culture in Medellín is strongly linked to a broader Paisa culture (see next section) whose unique attributes include their Spanish accent, cuisine, and hospitality. Today, Medellín has several cultural attractions for the public including approximately 40 museums, 21 public parks, 28 theaters, and several public libraries. The city also contains several fixtures that have been designated National monuments of Colombia.

Most people in Medellín are Catholic, as reflected by Medellín&#x27;s several churches and religious activities. Among the most representative churches are the Metropolitan Cathedral, the largest cathedral in the world built entirely in baked brick. There is also the Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria, which was the official cathedral until 1931; the Church of San Ignacio, Baroque on the outside and Colonial on inside; the Church of San José; the Church of San Antonio, which has one of the biggest domes in Colombia; the Church of San José del Poblado, located in the Parque del Poblado where the first European settlement in the Aburrá Valley was founded in 1616; and the Church of Nuestra Señora de Belén. All of these churches have religious art and are located in the center of the city, which facilitates journeys among them.

In December, the city is covered with thousands of fairy lights, creating the famous &quot;Alumbrados&quot; (Christmas lights), which are considered by the National Geographic as one of the ten most beautiful in the world, and which can be seen mainly on &quot;La Playa&quot; Avenue and the Medellín River.
Plaza Mayor is the epicenter of large events and business. By a decree of the municipal government, between 1980 and 1990 all developments or tall buildings necessarily included a sculpture of a famous artist. That is one reason why Medellín has the largest number of sculptures per square kilometer in Colombia.

Furthermore, the city has several festivals and exhibitions year-round. The silletero tradition is also closely tied to the region and is considered a part of Colombian cultural heritage. Since 1957, this tradition has continued in the Silleta Parade that takes place during the annual Festival of the Flowers, where silletas designed with flower arrangements are carried.

Works of many prominent artists, both local and foreign, can be seen on the streets of the city. Some artists who stand out are the masters Rodrigo Arenas Betancur and Fernando Botero.

===Paisa culture===

The inhabitants of Medellín are often called &quot;Antioqueños&quot; (people of Antioquia) after their province, rather than &quot;Medellínenses&quot; (people of Medellín) after their city. They are also often known as &quot;Paisas&quot;, a name which some suggest comes from the coffee growers. The term &quot;Paisa&quot; comes from the word &quot;paisano&quot;, meaning &quot;fellow countryman&quot;. &quot;Paisas&quot; make up one of the five different regional cultures within Colombia. In addition to Antioquia, the Paisa region includes the departments of Caldas, Risaralda, Quindio and some towns of Valle del Cauca and Tolima. Although Paisa culture is dominant in Medellín, the so-called &quot;Paisa Capital&quot;, the city is becoming more cosmopolitan, now offering music from other regions of Colombia (Vallenato and Chocó), and a variety of restaurants including Chinese, Cuban, and Argentinian.

The Paisa culture has a Spanish background, and is traditionally Catholic, and entrepreneurial. Paisas are said to speak softly and quickly, to smile easily, and to love music, poetry, soccer, bargaining in the markets, and parties. They are proud of their city, and work hard to keep it clean, stemming from the campaign begun in the 1980s, &quot;Depende tambien de ti, darle amor a Medellín&quot; (It depends on you too to give love to Medellín). The Medellín weekend nightlife, in discos, pubs, parks, and certain dedicated streets, is traditionally called &quot;rumba&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, pointwise convergence is one of various senses in which a sequence of functions can converge to a particular function. It is weaker than uniform convergence, to which it is often compared.

==Definition==

Suppose that formula_1 is a set and formula_2 is a topological space, such as the real or complex numbers or a metric space, for example. A sequence of functions formula_3 all having the same domain formula_1 and codomain formula_2 is said to converge pointwise to a given function formula_6 often written as
formula_7
if (and only if) the limit of the sequence formula_8 evaluated at each point formula_9 in the domain of formula_10 is equal to formula_11, written as
formula_12
The function formula_10 is said to be the pointwise limit function of the formula_14

The definition easily generalizes from sequences to nets formula_15. We say formula_16 converges pointwise to formula_10, written as
formula_18
if (and only if) formula_11 is the unique accumulation point of the net formula_20 evaluated at each point formula_9 in the domain of formula_10, written as
formula_23

Sometimes, authors use the term bounded pointwise convergence when there is a constant formula_24 such that formula_25 .

==Properties==

This concept is often contrasted with uniform convergence. To say that
formula_26
means that
formula_27
where formula_28 is the common domain of formula_10 and formula_30, and formula_31 stands for the supremum. That is a stronger statement than the assertion of pointwise convergence: every uniformly convergent sequence is pointwise convergent, to the same limiting function, but some pointwise convergent sequences are not uniformly convergent. For example, if formula_32 is a sequence of functions defined by formula_33 then formula_34 pointwise on the interval formula_35 but not uniformly.

The pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions may be a discontinuous function, but only if the convergence is not uniform. For example,
formula_36
takes the value formula_37 when formula_9 is an integer and formula_39 when formula_9 is not an integer, and so is discontinuous at every integer.

The values of the functions formula_30 need not be real numbers, but may be in any topological space, in order that the concept of pointwise convergence make sense. Uniform convergence, on the other hand, does not make sense for functions taking values in topological spaces generally, but makes sense for functions taking values in metric spaces, and, more generally, in uniform spaces.

==Topology==

Let formula_42 denote the set of all functions from some given set formula_1 into some topological space formula_44
As described in the article on characterizations of the category of topological spaces, if certain conditions are met then it is possible to define a unique topology on a set in terms of which nets do and do not converge. 
The definition of pointwise convergence meets these conditions and so it induces a topology, called the , on the set formula_42 of all functions of the form formula_46 
A net in formula_42 converges in this topology if and only if it converges pointwise. 

The topology of pointwise convergence is the same as convergence in the product topology on the space formula_48 where formula_1 is the domain and formula_2 is the codomain. 
Explicitly, if formula_51 is a set of functions from some set formula_1 into some topological space formula_2 then the topology of pointwise convergence on formula_54 is equal to the subspace topology that it inherits from the product space formula_55 when formula_54 is identified as a subset of this Cartesian product via the canonical inclusion map formula_57 defined by formula_58 

If the codomain formula_2 is compact, then by Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, the space formula_42 is also compact.

==Almost everywhere convergence==

In measure theory, one talks about &quot;almost everywhere convergence&quot; of a sequence of measurable functions defined on a measurable space. That means pointwise convergence almost everywhere, that is, on a subset of the domain whose complement has measure zero. Egorov&#x27;s theorem states that pointwise convergence almost everywhere on a set of finite measure implies uniform convergence on a slightly smaller set.

Almost everywhere pointwise convergence on the space of functions on a measure space does not define the structure of a topology on the space of measurable functions on a measure space (although it is a convergence structure). For in a topological space, when every subsequence of a sequence has itself a subsequence with the same subsequential limit, the sequence itself must converge to that limit. 

But consider the sequence of so-called &quot;galloping rectangles&quot; functions (also known as the typewriter sequence), which are defined using the floor function: let formula_61 and formula_62 mod formula_63 and let
formula_64

Then any subsequence of the sequence formula_65 has a sub-subsequence which itself converges almost everywhere to zero, for example, the subsequence of functions which do not vanish at formula_66 But at no point does the original sequence converge pointwise to zero. Hence, unlike convergence in measure and formula_67 convergence, pointwise convergence almost everywhere is not the convergence of any topology on the space of functions.

<text>The Snowbirds, officially known as 431 Air Demonstration Squadron (), are the military aerobatics flight demonstration team of the Royal Canadian Air Force. The team is based at 15 Wing Moose Jaw near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. The Snowbirds&#x27; official purpose is to &quot;demonstrate the skill, professionalism, and teamwork of Canadian Forces personnel&quot;. The team also provides a public relations and recruiting role, and serves as an aerial ambassador for the Canadian Armed Forces. The Snowbirds are the first Canadian air demonstration team to be designated as a squadron.

The show team flies 11 CT-114 Tutors: nine for aerobatic performances, including two solo aircraft, and two spares, flown by the team coordinators. Additionally, 13 are maintained in storage. Approximately 80 Canadian Forces personnel work with the squadron full-time; 24 personnel are in the show team that travels during the show season. The Snowbirds are the only major military aerobatics team that operates without a support aircraft.

The Snowbirds continue the flying demonstration tradition of previous Canadian air force aerobatic teams, which include the Siskins, the Blue Devils, the Golden Hawks, and the Golden Centennaires.
==Squadron history==

===Second World War===
Although 431 Air Demonstration Squadron was formed in 1978, its history truly began during the Second World War when, as part of the Commonwealth contribution to aircrew for the war in Europe, 431 (Iroquois) Squadron Royal Canadian Air Force was created under the control of RAF Bomber Command.

Number 431 Squadron formed on 11 November 1942, at RAF Burn (in North Yorkshire), flying Wellington B.X medium bombers with No. 4 Group RAF Bomber Command. The squadron moved to RAF Tholthorpe in mid-1943 as part of the move to bring all RCAF squadrons into one operational group – No. 6 Group RCAF – and converted to Halifax B.V four-engined heavy bombers. In December 1943 the squadron moved to RAF Croft where it was re-equipped with Halifax IIIs and later, Lancaster B.X aircraft. 
The squadron moved to RCAF Station Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, after the war, disbanding there on 5 September 1945.

===Postwar===

====Squadron re-formed====
No. 431 (Fighter) Squadron re-formed at RCAF Station Bagotville on 18 January 1954, using the new Canadair Sabre. The squadron was formed on a temporary basis until there were enough new CF-100s available to fulfill RCAF squadron needs. No. 431&#x27;s duties included aerial combat training and displaying the capabilities of jet operations to the public at air shows, the largest being &quot;Operation Prairie Pacific&quot;: a 50-minute exhibition with aircraft from several squadrons that travelled to selected locations across western Canada. The team from No. 431 Squadron consisted of four Sabres and a solo aircraft. This was the first Sabre team to be authorized to perform formation aerobatics in Canada. The unit was disbanded on 1 October 1954.

====2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School Formation Team====
In 1969, Colonel O.B. Philp, base commander of CFB Moose Jaw and former commander of the defunct Golden Centennaires aerobatic team, considered using several of the leftover Golden Centennaire CT-114 Tutor aircraft for another team. These Tutors were still fitted for aerobatic flying and, because of some minor corrosion, had been painted with white anti-corrosive paint. Philp, at this point, did not receive approval to form the new team; however, approval had been given for single Tutors to provide simple flypasts at local football games.

To further the cause of an aerobatic team, Philp began informal enhanced formation practice for the instructors at 2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School with the aim of providing multi-aircraft flypasts at special events. In 1970, four-aircraft formations began providing flypasts at fairs and festivals, as well as Armed Forces Day at CFB Moose Jaw. In July 1970, a white Tutor was introduced to the formation for flypasts. Four white Tutors were finally flown together at the Abbotsford Air Show, followed by a flypast in Winnipeg. Known as the &quot;2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School Formation Team&quot;, or informally as the &quot;Tutor Whites&quot;, the team grew in size to seven aircraft in 1971 using eleven pilots, and gradually gained recognition. Formation flypasts were replaced with more complicated manoeuvres, and more aircraft were added as the team matured.

====New name and squadron reactivation====

A contest to give the air demonstration team a formal name was held at Bushell Park Elementary School at CFB Moose Jaw, and resulted in the name &quot;Snowbirds&quot;. The name reflected the aircraft&#x27;s distinctive mostly-white paint scheme used at the time, connoted grace and beauty and was clearly linked to its Canadian origins. The name was formally adopted on 25 June 1971. The Snowbirds were officially authorized to be designated the &quot;Canadian Forces Air Demonstration Team&quot; on 15 January 1975, and was formed into its own squadron by reactivating 431 Squadron (renamed 431 Air Demonstration Squadron) on 1 April 1978.

The squadron badge has, since 1942, portrayed &quot;an Iroquois&#x27; head adorned&quot;. In January 2021, the squadron began an initiative to remove this image from the badge.

==Show routine==

Formations and manoeuvres are designed each season by the team, and must be approved by the Canadian Forces, Transport Canada and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure safety guidelines are complied with. FAA approval is necessary since the team performs in the United States.

Three aerobatic shows are designed: a high show flown when weather is ideal, a low show and a flat show. The latter two are flown where some manoeuvres are not permitted because of cloud. A non-aerobatic show, or flypast, is also flown. Manoeuvres are arranged from those selected from the Standard Manoeuvre Manual. Some elements of the show are passed down from one season to the next. These include the Canada burst, heart, downward bomb burst, solo head on crosses, and their signature nine-abreast exit. Training occurs over several months. Once manoeuvres are mastered and the team is comfortable with the routine, the Snowbirds deploy to CFB Comox for specialized training. After approvals are obtained, an &quot;acceptance show&quot; is performed at Moose Jaw to allow representatives from the three approving agencies to see a live performance. The team will go on to perform shows throughout North America from May to October. The last show is performed at Moose Jaw.

Pilots typically stay with the Snowbirds for a maximum of three years, and one third of the pilots are replaced each year. Replacing pilots this way allows experienced members to train the new team members, which ensures that the Snowbirds&#x27; routines are consistent.

The Snowbirds were the first aerobatic team in the world to use music in their show, and music is often used with live commentary from the performing pilots.

The Snowbirds fly at speeds between and , with a separation between aircraft of in many of the formations. When two aircraft perform head-on passes, they aim to be about apart.

Due to crashes in October 2019 and May 2020, restrictions were placed on shows beginning in 2021. To give pilots &quot;more time to react&quot;, restrictions were placed on altitude and speed, and new rules were introduced concerning the minimum runway length permitted for Snowbird operations. Maintenance and inspections on the Tutors have also been increased.

Transportation of support material such as repair parts, luggage, and other equipment is provided by an 18-wheeler mobile support unit that follows the team across the country.

==Awards, honours, and ambassadorships==

==Notable staff==
* Lois Boyle (1932–2012): in her role as a civilian senior administrative assistant to several base commanders of CFB Moose Jaw, Boyle was closely involved in the birth of the Snowbirds and also helping them mature into the 1980s. For her years of dedication and support to the team she earned the title &#x27;Mother of the Snowbirds&#x27;, and her funeral ceremony was marked with an honorary flyover by seven Snowbird jets.

==Incidents and fatalities==

===Incidents===
Since the Snowbirds&#x27; first show in July 1971, there have been several incidents involving damage to airplanes, loss of airplanes, and loss of life. The following is a list of notable incidents only. There are other incidents, some involving loss of aircraft, that are not listed below.

===Fatalities===

Snowbird aircraft have been involved in several accidents, resulting in the deaths of seven pilots and two passengers and the loss of several aircraft. One pilot, Captain Wes Mackay, was killed in an automobile accident after a performance in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in 1988. The RCAF commented: &quot;... there is risk associated with formation flying. Flying by its very nature has an inherent element of risk. Eight Snowbird pilots have lost their lives in the performance of their duty. We remember them.&quot;

* 10 June 1972: Solo Captain Lloyd Waterer died after a wingtip collision with the other solo aircraft while performing an opposing solo manoeuvre at the Trenton Air Show at CFB Trenton, Ontario.
* 3 May 1978: Captain Gordon de Jong died at an air show in Grande Prairie, Alberta. The horizontal stabilizer failed, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. Although pilot ejection was initiated, it was not successful.
* 3 September 1989: Captain Shane Antaya died after a midair collision during a demonstration at the Canadian International Air Show during the CNE in Toronto, Ontario, when his Tutor crashed into Lake Ontario. During the same accident, team commander Major Dan Dempsey safely ejected from his aircraft.
* 10 December 1998: Captain Michael VandenBos died in a midair collision during training near Moose Jaw.
* 10 December 2004: Captain Miles Selby died in a midair collision during training near Mossbank, Saskatchewan, while practising the co-loop manoeuvre. The other pilot, Captain Chuck Mallett, was thrown from his destroyed aircraft while still strapped into his seat. While tumbling towards the ground, he was able to unstrap, deploy his parachute and land with only minor injuries.
* 18 May 2007: Snowbird 2, Captain Shawn McCaughey fatally crashed during practice at Malmstrom Air Force Base near Great Falls, Montana, due to a restraining strap malfunction.
* 9 October 2008: A Snowbird Tutor piloted by newly recruited team member Captain Bryan Mitchell with military photographer Sergeant Charles Senecal crashed, killing both, near the Snowbirds&#x27; home base of 15 Wing Moose Jaw while on a non-exhibition flight.
* 17 May 2020: A Snowbird Tutor crashed in Kamloops, British Columbia, during a cross-country tour called &quot;Operation Inspiration&quot;, intended to &quot;salute Canadians doing their part to fight the spread of COVID-19.&quot; Unit public affairs officer, Captain Jennifer Casey, died. The pilot, Captain Richard MacDougall, sustained serious injuries. The final report of the Directorate of Flight Safety concluded that &quot;both occupants’ ejection sequences were outside of the ejection envelope.&quot;

==Aircraft replacement==

Due to the age of the Tutors (developed in the 1950s, first flown in 1960, and accepted by the RCAF in 1963), a 2003 Department of National Defence study recommended that the procurement process to replace the aircraft should begin immediately so the aircraft could be retired by 2010 because of obsolescence issues that would affect the aircraft&#x27;s viability. The report mentions that &quot;with each passing year, the technical, safety and financial risk associated with extending the Tutor into its fifth decade and beyond, will escalate&quot;. Some concerns include the inevitability of metal fatigue and parts failure, outdated ejection seats and antiquated avionics. There has also been criticism about the aircraft not being representative of a modern air force.

A 2008 review recommended that the Tutors&#x27; life could be extended to 2020 because of cost concerns related to purchasing new aircraft, and a 2015 report called &quot;CT-114 Life Extension Beyond 2020&quot;, outlined planned upgrades to extend the life of the Tutor beyond 2020. These planned upgrades included replacing the ejection seats and wing components, and updating the brakes.

The Government of Canada had plans to replace the Tutors with new aircraft between 2026 and 2035 via the Snowbird Aircraft Replacement Project whose aim was &quot;to satisfy the operational requirement to provide the mandated Government of Canada aerobatic air demonstration capability to Canadian and North American audiences&quot;. The preliminary estimated cost was $500 million to $1.5 billion. Official sources were quoted: &quot;The chosen platform must be configurable to the 431 (AD) Squadron standard, including a smoke system, luggage capability and a unique paint scheme. The platform must also be interchangeable with the training fleet to ensure the hard demands of show performances can be distributed throughout the aircraft fleet.&quot; However, the Snowbird Aircraft Replacement Project was discontinued and replaced by the Tutor Life Extension Program implemented by a contractor (L3Harris) that is meant to extend the use of the Tutor fleet to 2030. The Tutors will receive modernized avionics to comply with regulations and permit the team to continue flying in North America. The Tutors’ escape system, which includes parachutes and harness will also be upgraded, and canopy designs will be assessed.

A 2024 decision by the Department of National Defence to consider retiring costly older equipment will affect the Snowbirds. The defence minister is concerned that the Tutor has finally “aged out” and mentioned that the aircraft is “well past its utility.” The minister is also concerned about safety issues. The government intends to keep the Snowbirds, albeit with better aircraft. The defence minister has asked the RCAF to start searching for a potential replacement aircraft and the Department of National Defence is in the process of &quot;examining a number of capabilities&quot;.

<doc id="340201" wikidata="Q589260" url="?curid=340201" title="Soundproofing">
<text>Soundproofing is any means of impeding sound propagation. There are several methods employed including increasing the distance between the source and receiver, decoupling, using noise barriers to reflect or absorb the energy of the sound waves, using damping structures such as sound baffles for absorption, or using active anti-noise sound generators.

Acoustic quieting and noise control can be used to limit unwanted noise. Soundproofing can reduce the transmission of unwanted direct sound waves from the source to an involuntary listener through the use of distance and intervening objects in the sound path (see sound transmission class and sound reduction index).

Soundproofing can suppress unwanted indirect sound waves such as reflections that cause echoes and resonances that cause reverberation.

== Techniques ==

===Absorption===
Sound-absorbing material controls reverberant sound pressure levels within a cavity, enclosure or room. Synthetic absorption materials are porous, referring to open cell foam (acoustic foam, soundproof foam). Fibrous absorption material such as cellulose, mineral wool, fiberglass, sheep&#x27;s wool, are more commonly used to deaden resonant frequencies within a cavity (wall, floor, or ceiling insulation), serving a dual purpose along with their thermal insulation properties. Both fibrous and porous absorption material are used to create acoustic panels, which absorb sound reflections in a room, improving speech intelligibility.

====Porous absorbers====
Porous absorbers, typically open cell rubber foams or melamine sponges, absorb noise by friction within the cell structure. Porous open cell foams are highly effective noise absorbers across a broad range of medium-high frequencies. Performance can be less impressive at lower frequencies. The exact absorption profile of a porous open-cell foam will be determined by a number of factors including cell size, tortuosity, porosity, thickness, and density. 

The absorption aspect in soundproofing should not be confused with sound-absorbing panels used in acoustic treatments. Absorption in this sense refers to reducing a resonating frequency in a cavity by installing insulation between walls, ceilings or floors. Acoustic panels can play a role in treatment reducing reflections that make the overall sound in the source room louder, after walls, ceilings, and floors have been soundproofed.

====Resonant absorbers====
Resonant panels, Helmholtz resonators and other resonant absorbers work by damping a sound wave as they reflect it. Unlike porous absorbers, resonant absorbers are most effective at low-medium frequencies and the absorption of resonant absorbers is matched to a narrow frequency range.

===Damping===
Damping serves to reduce resonance in the room, by absorption or redirection through reflection or diffusion. Absorption reduces the overall sound level, whereas redirection makes unwanted sound harmless or even beneficial by reducing coherence. Damping can be separately applied to reduce the acoustic resonance in the air or to reduce mechanical resonance in the structure of the room itself or things in the room.

===Decoupling===
Creating separation between a sound source and any form of adjoining mass, hindering the direct pathway for sound transfer.

===Distance===
The energy density of sound waves decreases as they become farther apart so increasing the distance between the receiver and source results in a progressively lesser intensity of sound at the receiver. In a normal three-dimensional setting, with a point source and point receptor, the intensity of sound waves will be attenuated according to the inverse square of the distance from the source.

===Mass===
Adding dense material to treatment helps stop sound waves from exiting a source wall, ceiling or floor. Materials include mass-loaded vinyl, soundproof sheetrock or drywall, plywood, fibreboard, concrete or rubber. Different widths and densities in soundproofing material reduce sound within a variable frequency range.

===Reflection===
When sound waves hit a medium, the reflection of that sound is dependent on the dissimilarity of the material it comes in contact with. Sound hitting a concrete surface will result in a much different reflection than if the sound were to hit a softer medium such as fiberglass. In an outdoor environment such as highway engineering, embankments or paneling are often used to reflect sound upwards into the sky.

===Diffusion===
If a specular reflection from a hard flat surface is giving a problematic echo then an acoustic diffuser may be applied to the surface. It will scatter sound in all directions.

===Active noise control===
In active noise control, a microphone is used to pick up the sound that is then analyzed by a computer; then, sound waves with opposite polarity (180° phase at all frequencies) are output through a speaker, causing destructive interference and canceling much of the noise.

== Applications ==

=== Residential ===
Residential sound programs aim to decrease or eliminate the effects of exterior noise. The main focus of a residential sound program in existing structures is the windows and doors. Solid wood doors are a better sound barrier than hollow doors. Curtains can be used to dampen sound, either through use of heavy materials or through the use of air chambers known as honeycombs. Single-, double- and triple-honeycomb designs achieve relatively greater degrees of sound damping. The primary soundproofing limit of curtains is the lack of a seal at the edge of the curtain, although this may be alleviated with the use of sealing features, such as hook and loop fastener, adhesive, magnets, or other materials. The thickness of glass will play a role when diagnosing sound leakage. Double-pane windows achieve somewhat greater sound damping than single-pane windows when well-sealed into the opening of the window frame and wall.

Significant noise reduction can also be achieved by installing a second interior window. In this case, the exterior window remains in place while a slider or hung window is installed within the same wall openings.

In the US, the FAA offers sound-reducing for homes that fall within a noise contour where the average sound level is or greater. It is part of their Residential Sound Insulation Program. The program provides solid-core wood entry doors plus windows and storm doors.

=== Ceilings ===
Sealing gaps and cracks around electrical wiring, water pipes and ductwork using acoustical caulk or spray foam will significantly reduce unwanted noise as a preliminary step for ceiling soundproofing. Acoustical caulk should be used along the perimeter of the wall and around all fixtures and duct registers to further seal the treatment. Mineral wool insulation is most commonly used in soundproofing for its density and low cost compared to other soundproofing materials. Spray foam insulation should only be used to fill gaps and cracks or as a 1-2 inch layer before installing mineral wool. Cured spray foam and other closed-cell foam can be a sound conductor. Spray foam is not porous enough to absorb sound and is also not dense enough to stop sound.

An effective method to reduce impact noise is the &quot;resilient isolation channel&quot;. The channels decouple the drywall from the joists, reducing the transfer of vibration.

=== Walls ===
Mass is the only way to stop sound. Mass refers to drywall, plywood or concrete. Mass-loaded vinyl (MLV) is used to dampen or weaken sound waves between layers of mass. Use of a viscoelastic damping compound or MLV converts sound waves into heat, weakening the waves before they reach the next layer of mass. It is important to use multiple layers of mass, in different widths and densities, to optimize any given soundproofing treatment. Installing soundproof drywall is recommended for its higher sound transmission class (STC) value. Soundproof drywall in combination with a viscoelastic compound may achieve a noise reduction of STC 60+.

Walls are filled with mineral wool insulation. Depending on the desired level of treatment, two layers of insulation may be required. Outlets, light switches, and electrical boxes are weak points in any given soundproofing treatment. Electrical boxes should be wrapped in clay or putty and backed with MLV. After switch plates, outlet covers and lights are installed, acoustical caulking should be applied around the perimeter of the plates or fixtures.

=== Floors ===

Decoupling between the joist and subfloor plywood using neoprene joist tape or u-shaped rubber spacers helps create soundproof flooring. An additional layer of plywood can be installed with a viscoelastic compound. Mass loaded vinyl, in combination with open-cell rubber or a closed-cell foam floor underlayment, will further reduce sound transmission. After applying these techniques, hardwood flooring or carpeting can be installed. Additional area rugs and furniture will help reduce unwanted reflection within the room.

=== Room within a room ===

A room within a room (RWAR) is one method of isolating sound and preventing it from transmitting to the outside world where it may be undesirable.

Most sound transfer from a room to the outside occurs through mechanical means. The vibration passes directly through the brick, woodwork and other solid structural elements. When it meets with an element such as a wall, ceiling, floor or window, which acts as a sounding board, the vibration is amplified and heard in the second space. A mechanical transmission is much faster, more efficient and more readily amplified than an airborne transmission of the same initial strength.

The use of acoustic foam and other absorbent means is less effective against this transmitted vibration. The transmission can be stopped by breaking the connection between the room that contains the noise source and the outside world. This is called acoustic decoupling.

===Commercial===
Restaurants, schools, office businesses, and healthcare facilities use architectural acoustics to reduce noise for their customers. In the United States, OSHA has requirements regulating the length of exposure of workers to certain levels of noise.

For educators and students, improving the sound quality of an environment will subsequently improve student learning, concentration, and teacher-student inter-communications. In 2014, a research study conducted by Applied Science revealed 86% of students perceived their instructors more intelligibly, while 66% of students reported experiencing higher concentration levels after sound-absorbing materials were incorporated into the classroom.

=== Automotive ===
Automotive soundproofing aims to decrease or eliminate the effects of exterior noise, primarily engine, exhaust and tire noise across a wide frequency range. A panel damping material is fitted which reduces the vibration of the vehicle&#x27;s body panels when they are excited by one of the many high-energy sound sources in play when the vehicle is in use. There are many complex noises created within vehicles which change with the driving environment and speed at which the vehicle travels. Significant noise reductions of up to 8 dB can be achieved by installing a combination of different types of materials.

The automotive environment limits the thickness of materials that can be used, but combinations of dampers, barriers, and absorbers are common. Common materials include felt, foam, polyester, and polypropylene blend materials. Waterproofing may be necessary depending on the materials used. Acoustic foam can be applied in different areas of a vehicle during manufacture to reduce cabin noise. Foams also have cost and performance advantages in installation since foam material can expand and fill cavities after application and also prevent leaks and some gases from entering the vehicle. Vehicle soundproofing can reduce wind, engine, road, and tire noise. Vehicle soundproofing can reduce sound inside a vehicle from five to 20 decibels.

Surface-damping materials are very effective at reducing structure-borne noise. Passive damping materials have been used since the early 1960s in the aerospace industry. Over the years, advances in material manufacturing and the development of more efficient analytical and experimental tools to characterize complex dynamic behaviors enabled the expansion of the usage of these materials to the automotive industry. Nowadays, multiple viscoelastic damping pads are usually attached to the body in order to attenuate higher-order structural panel modes that significantly contribute to the overall noise level inside the cabin. Traditionally, experimental techniques are used to optimize the size and location of damping treatments. In particular, laser vibrometer-type tests are often conducted on the body in white structures enabling the fast acquisition of a large number of measurement points with a good spatial resolution. However, testing a complete vehicle is mostly infeasible, requiring evaluation of every subsystem individually, hence limiting the usability of this technology in a fast and efficient way. Alternatively, structural vibrations can also be acoustically measured using particle velocity sensors located near a vibrating structure. Several studies have revealed the potential of particle velocity sensors for characterizing structural vibrations, which accelerates the entire testing process when combined with scanning techniques.

====Noise barriers====

Since the early 1970s, it has become common practice in the United States and other industrialized countries to engineer noise barriers along major highways to protect adjacent residents from intruding roadway noise. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in conjunction with State Highway Administration (SHA) adopted Federal Regulation (23 CFR 772) requiring each state to adopt their own policy in regards to abatement of highway traffic noise. Engineering techniques have been developed to predict an effective geometry for the noise barrier design in a particular real-world situation. Noise barriers may be constructed of wood, masonry, earth or a combination thereof.

<doc id="340204" wikidata="Q1622" url="?curid=340204" title="Neuwerk">
<text>Neuwerk (; (&quot;Archaic English&quot;: New Werk or Newark) is a tidal island in the Wadden Sea (&quot;Mudflat Sea&quot;) a marginal part of North Sea along the German coast. The population in 2023 was 21. Neuwerk is located northwest of Cuxhaven, between the Weser and Elbe estuaries. The distance to the centre of Hamburg is about .

Administratively, Neuwerk forms a homonymous quarter of the city and state of Hamburg, Germany, and is part of the borough Hamburg-Mitte. This quarter includes the islands of Scharhörn and Nigehörn, which are bird sanctuaries and closed to the public. All three islands and the Wadden Sea around them form the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park.

Dikes encircle the island, which is about , and one can walk around it in an hour. Salt marshes (the &quot;Outland&quot;), lie outside the dikes and provide a hatchery for birds such as oystercatchers, common terns, sandwich terns, black-headed gull, herring gulls, and others. During the summer farmers may pasture cows and horses on the northern Outland.
At low tide one can reach the island on foot or on a Wattwagen, a horse-drawn mud flat coach, from Cuxhaven. A row of poles on the mud flats marks the way. The path includes some elevated cages. These are rescue pods. Should high tide catch a walker far from shore, the walker can climb into the pod and wait for the tide to recede, or trigger a flare. Triggering the flare summons a rescue boat; rescue involves a fee and non-negligible fine.

During the summer the vessel MS &quot;Flipper&quot; makes a daily trip at high tide from the &quot;Alte Liebe&quot; port in Cuxhaven to the island. Because departure times depend on the tides, the times are variable. The trip takes about an hour and a half one-way.

One may, for a small fee, visit and ascend the lighthouse to a viewing platform. This provides a view of the coast and the entire island. There is a small hotel with seven guest rooms inside the lighthouse, and a hostel in a building next to the tower. Near the lighthouse there is the &quot;graveyard of the nameless&quot;. This is a resting place for the dead bodies that in past years washed ashore. Today, bodies washed ashore are transferred to the continent.

== History ==

Because the Elbe was vital to Hamburg, a member of the Hanseatic League, the city&#x27;s merchants with those from Bremen and Stade obtained the permission (a deed of 24 April 1286) from Albert II, Duke of Saxony and his minor nephews Albert III, Eric I and John II, altogether co-ruling feudal lords of the Land of Hadeln of which Neuwerk formed a part then, to maintain a permanent fire on a mud flat island, then named &quot;O&quot; or &quot;Nige O&quot;, in the mouth of the Elbe.

On 1 November 1299 Albert III and John II allowed the Hamburg and other seafaring merchants to build a fortified tower, named the &quot;new work&quot; (Neuwerk). Right after work commenced on a watchtower that could act as a daymark; the tower was completed in 1310. After its completion, an alderman and ten men-at-arms seized the tower. The oldest existing document that mentions Neuwerk is a Frisian contract of 1316. This document uses the island&#x27;s old name of &quot;Nige O&quot;.

The current tower dates to 1367, 1369, or 1377 (accounts vary), built after a fire destroyed its wooden predecessor. The tower is Hamburg&#x27;s oldest existing building as well as the last remainder of Hamburg&#x27;s fortifications.

In 1648 the tower received a beacon fire that was lit at night. The tower was converted into a lighthouse in 1814. Still, the island was the site of numerous shipwrecks.

During World War I, a shell destroyed the beacon and its signalling apparatus. On 3 September 1915 lightning struck the Zeppelin LZ 40 (L 10), causing it to crash into the North Sea near Neuwerk, with the loss of the entire 20-man crew.

Due to the Greater Hamburg Law Neuwerk became part of Prussia in 1937, and thus after World War II it became part of the new state of Lower Saxony.

In 1946 an 18 kW wind turbine, in diameter, installed to economize on diesel fuel, helped power the lighthouse and residences on the island. This installation ran for around 20 years before a submarine cable to the mainland replaced it.

In 1969 Hamburg waived older rights on harbour estate in Cuxhaven in favour of Neuwerk and Scharhörn.

== Shipwrecks ==


== Demographics ==
On 31 December 2007, Neuwerk quarter had 39 inhabitants, 26 female and 13 males. 11 were resident aliens.

<doc id="340219" wikidata="Q697279" url="?curid=340219" title="Petition">
<text>A petition is a request to do something, most commonly addressed to a government official or public entity. Petitions to a deity are a form of prayer called supplication.

In the colloquial sense, a petition is a document addressed to an official and signed by numerous individuals. A petition may be oral rather than written, or may be transmitted via the Internet.

==Legal==
&quot;Petition&quot; can also be the title of a legal pleading that initiates a legal case. The initial pleading in a civil lawsuit that seeks only money (damages) might be called (in most U.S. courts) a &quot;complaint&quot;. An initial pleading in a lawsuit that seeks non-monetary or &quot;equitable&quot; relief, such as a request for a writ of &quot;mandamus&quot; or &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, custody of a child, or probate of a will, is instead called a &quot;petition&quot;.

Act on petition is a &quot;summary process&quot; used in probate, ecclesiastical and divorce cases, designed to handle matters which are too complex for simple motion. The parties in a case exchange pleadings until a cause for a hearing is settled. Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary specifies it as an obsolete method used in admiralty cases. In the United States, the &quot;act on petition&quot; has been used in maritime cases.

==Early history==
The first documented petitions were made by slaves building pyramids in Ancient Egypt who petitioned for better working conditions.

In pre-modern Imperial China petitions were always sent to an Office of Transmission (&quot;Tongzheng si&quot; or &quot;通政司&quot;) where court secretaries read petitions aloud to the emperor. Petitions could be sent by anybody, from a scholar-official to a common farmer, although the petitions were more likely read to the emperor if they were persuasive enough to impeach questionable and corrupt local officials from office. When petitions arrived to the throne, multiple copies were made of the original and stored with the Office of Supervising Secretaries before the original written petition was sent to the emperor.

Inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire, as individuals and as groups, had the right to petition local representatives of the empire or to petition the sultan directly. In the capital city of Istanbul, a bureau influenced by the one that had existed in Byzantine Constantinople tracked and archived all petitions along with any annotations and administrative actions related to them. Beginning in the early 1740s, petitions were separated from other affairs and recorded in a unique archive. Hundreds of thousands of petitions were archived in Istanbul between the 15th and 20th centuries. By the early 16th century, a large portion of day-to-day decisions were made in response to petitions. Negotiations between city leaders and the empire often used petitions; this practice continued into the Tanzimat period. These negotiations contributed to the development of jurisprudence.

The emergence of petitioning during the reign of Edward I of England (1272-1307) contributed to beginnings of legislative power for the Parliament of England. Petitions became a common form of protest and request to the British House of Commons in the 18th and 19th centuries; one million petitions were submitted to the UK&#x27;s parliament between 1780 and 1918. The largest was the Great/People&#x27;s Charter, or petition of the Chartists.

The Petition Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right of the people &quot;to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot; The right to petition has been held to include the right to file lawsuits against the government.

==Modern use==

Petitions are commonly used in the U.S. to qualify candidates for public office to appear on a ballot; while anyone can be a write-in candidate, a candidate desiring that his or her name appear on printed ballots and other official election materials must gather a certain number of valid signatures from registered voters. In jurisdictions whose laws allow for ballot initiatives, the gathering of a sufficient number of voter signatures qualifies a proposed initiative to be placed on the ballot. The 2003 California recall election, which culminated in the recall of Governor Gray Davis and the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger, began when U.S. Representative Darrell Issa employed paid signature gatherers who obtained millions of signatures at a cost to Issa of millions of dollars. Once the requisite number of signatures was obtained on the recall petition, other petitions were circulated by would-be candidates who wanted to appear on the ballot as possible replacements for Davis. After that step, a vote on the recall was scheduled.
Other types of petitions include those that sought to free Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment by the former apartheid government of South Africa. The petitions had no legal effect, but the signatures of millions of people on the petitions represented a moral force that may have helped free Mandela and end apartheid. Non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International often use petitions in an attempt to exert moral authority in support of various causes. Other nongovernmental subjects of petition drives include corporate personnel decisions. In the United Kingdom, a petition to the parliament in 1990 against ambulance service cuts attracted 4.5 million signatures. Today, petitions in Britain are often presented through the UK Parliament petitions website, the forerunner of which was set up in 2006. Such online petitions are a new form of a petition becoming commonplace in the 21st century. Change.org was founded in 2007 and became the world&#x27;s most popular online petition platform with around 50 million registered users.

Recent research by the sociocultural psychologist, Chana Etengoff, has highlighted the therapeutic benefits of petitioning including meaning-making, social action, agency and empowerment.

<doc id="340224" wikidata="Q2423515" url="?curid=340224" title="Duff Pattullo">
<text>Thomas Dufferin &quot;Duff&quot; Pattullo (January 19, 1873 – March 30, 1956) was a Canadian politician who served as the 22nd premier of British Columbia from 1933 to 1941 as a member of the Liberal Party and served as the member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia representing the riding of Prince Rupert from 1916 to 1945.

==Early life and early political career==
Born in Woodstock, Ontario, into a family of Scottish ancestry, Pattullo&#x27;s early career was as a journalist with two newspapers in Ontario: the &quot;Woodstock Sentinel&quot; in the 1890s, and as editor of the &quot;Galt Reformer&quot; in 1896. He got a job as secretary to James Morrow Walsh, the commissioner of the Yukon, where he stayed until 1902. In 1908, he moved to Prince Rupert, British Columbia and soon became mayor. He was elected to the provincial legislature in the 1916 election, and was appointed minister of lands in the Liberal government. Following the defeat of the Liberals in the 1928 election, Pattullo became Liberal Party leader, and leader of the opposition. In the 1933 election, with the Conservatives in disarray and not running any official candidates, Pattullo led the party back into government.

==Premier of British Columbia==

The Pattullo government, elected in the midst of the Great Depression, attempted to extend government services and relief to the unemployed. In the 1937 general election, his government was re-elected running on the slogan of &quot;socialized capitalism&quot;. His government was unable to secure a majority in the 1941 election due, in part, to the rise of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. He was unwilling to form a coalition government with the Conservatives, so his Liberal Party removed him as leader and formed such a coalition despite his objections.

Aside from his serving as Minister of Lands (1916 to 1928), Leader of the Opposition (1929 to 1933), and as Premier (1933 to 1941), during his time in the Legislature, Pattullo also served as Provincial Secretary (1927 to 1928), Attorney-General (1937 and again in 1941), Minister of Education (1941), Minister of Finance (1941), Minister of Public Works (1939), and Minister of Railways (1933 to 1937).

Premier T. D. Patullo announced an agreement had been reached with the Federal Government for the acquisition of the Yukon Territory by British Columbia. British Columbia to Annex Yukon And Be Second to Quebec in Area; Agreement With Ottawa Will Add 207,076 Square Miles to Province--Dominion Will Pay $125,000 a Year for Five Years Toward Costs--Legislature Must Act

Pattullo was vocal in his opposition to extending franchise to minority groups in the Province, both during and after his tenure as premier. The concern raised was that if Chinese Canadians or Japanese Canadians fight on behalf of Canada in WWII, these Canadians would return home and demand equal rights of citizenship.

==Later life==

In the 1945 election, Pattullo ran as an independent and lost his seat in the legislature and retired from politics.

He died in Victoria, British Columbia in 1956. He is interred and rested in the Royal Oak Burial Park in Victoria, British Columbia.

==Honours==

The Pattullo Bridge is named in his honour, as well as Prince Rupert&#x27;s Pattullo Park, Mount Pattullo, the Pattullo Range in North Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, and the Pattullo Glaciers in that range. Calls have been made to rename the replacement Pattullo bridge in consideration of Pattullo&#x27;s anti-Asian political decisions while Premier. The replacement bridge is due to be completed in 2024.

<text>The United American Free Will Baptist Church is the oldest national body of predominantly black Free Will Baptists in the United States.

==History==

The Free Will Baptist Church in America grew up on two separate fronts: North and South. In the South the denomination began in 1727 when Paul Palmer started a church in Chowan, North Carolina. The work in the north began with a congregation organized by Benjamin Randall in 1780 at New Durham, New Hampshire. Though they arose independently and there was no organizational connection between them, both taught the doctrines of free grace, free salvation and free will.

Free blacks and black slaves were members of predominantly white Free Will Baptist congregations of the South. African-Americans organized their first separate congregation, Shady Grove Free Will Baptist Church, at Snow Hill, Greene County, North Carolina, in 1867. The first annual conference was organized in 1870, and the first association in 1887. The first General Conference for United Free Will Baptists convened at St. John&#x27;s church in Kinston, North Carolina, on May 8, 1901. The greatest strength of this body is in North Carolina, where it maintains headquarters and a tabernacle and operates Kinston College in North Carolina. In 2007, there was an estimated 75,000 members in about 500 churches. The General Conference has published a book of discipline since 1903 and publishes a periodical called &quot;The Free Will Baptist Advocate&quot;. The United American Free Will Baptist Church is a member of the National Fraternal Council of Negro Churches. Bishop J. E. Reddick currently serves as General Bishop.

In 1968, a division brought about a second group of black Free Will Baptists, the United American Free Will Baptist Conference.

<doc id="340235" wikidata="Q9292715" url="?curid=340235" title="History of Poland (1918–1939)">
<text>The history of interwar Poland comprises the period from the revival of the independent Polish state in 1918, until the Invasion of Poland from the West by Nazi Germany in 1939 at the onset of World War II, followed by the Soviet Union from the East two weeks later. The two decades of Poland&#x27;s independence between the world wars are known as the &quot;Interbellum&quot;.

Poland re-emerged in November 1918 after more than a century of partitions by Austria-Hungary, the German, and the Russian Empires. Its independence was confirmed by the victorious powers through the Treaty of Versailles of June 1919, and most of the territory won in a series of border wars fought from 1918 to 1921. Poland&#x27;s frontiers were settled in 1922 and internationally recognized in 1923.
The Polish political scene was democratic but chaotic until Józef Piłsudski (1867–1935) seized power in May 1926 and democracy ended. The policy of agrarianism led to the redistribution of lands to peasants and the country achieved significant economic growth between 1921 and 1939. A third of the population consisted of minorities—Ukrainians, Jews, Belarusians, Lithuanians and Germans.

==Formative years (1918-1921)==
The independence of Poland had been successfully promoted to the Allies in Paris by Roman Dmowski and Ignacy Paderewski. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson made the independence of Poland a war goal in his Fourteen Points, and this goal was endorsed by the Allies in spring 1918. As part of the Armistice terms imposed on Germany, all German forces had to stand down in Poland and other occupied areas. So as the war ended, the Germans sent Piłsudski, then under arrest, back to Warsaw. On November 11, 1918, he took control of the puppet government the Germans had set up. Ignacy Daszyński headed a short-lived Polish government in Lublin from November 6 but Piłsudski had overwhelming prestige at this point. Daszyński and the other Polish leaders acknowledged him as head of the army and in effect head of what became the Republic of Poland. Germany, now defeated, followed the terms of the Armistice and withdrew its forces. Jędrzej Moraczewski became the first prime minister (in November 1918) and Dmowski headed the largest party. From its inception, the Republic fought a series of wars to secure its boundaries. The nation was rural and poor; the richest areas were in the former German areas in the west. Industrialization came very slowly, and was promoted in the mid-1930s with the development of the Central Industrial District.

===Boundaries===
Most Polish leaders of that period wanted to create a larger Polish state; one optimal plan, dating back to the Paris Peace Conference, included the incorporation of East Prussia and the German city of Königsberg being placed in a customs union with Poland. At the same time, the exact boundaries of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were not desired, though mentioned as an opening gambit by Roman Dmowski. Much of this land had been controlled by the Russian Empire since the Partitions of Poland and its inhabitants were struggling to create their own states (such as Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltics: Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia). The Polish leadership did not aim to restore the nation to its 17th-century boundaries. Opinions varied among Polish politicians as to how much of the territory a new, Polish-led state should contain and what form it should take. Józef Piłsudski advocated a democratic, Polish-led federation of independent states — while Roman Dmowski leader of the &quot;Endecja&quot; movement represented by the National Democratic Party, set his mind on a more compact Poland composed of ethnic Polish or &#x27;polonizable&#x27; territories.

To the southwest, Poland and Czechoslovakia contested boundary disputes (see: Trans-Olza). More ominously, an embittered Germany begrudged any territorial loss to its new eastern neighbor. The December 27, 1918 Great Poland Uprising liberated Greater Poland. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles settled the German-Polish borders in the Baltic region. The port city of Danzig (), with a majority German population and Polish minority was declared a free city independent of Germany, and became a bone of contention for decades. Allied arbitration divided the ethnically mixed and highly coveted industrial and mining district of Upper Silesia between Germany and Poland, with Poland receiving the smaller in size, but a more industrialized eastern section in 1922, after series of three Silesian Uprisings.

===War with Soviet Russia===

The military conflict with the Soviets proved the determinant of Poland&#x27;s frontiers in the east, a theater rendered chaotic by the repercussions of the Russian revolutions and subsequent civil war. Piłsudski envisioned creating a federation with the rest of Ukraine (led by the Polish-friendly government in Kiev he was to help to install) and Lithuania, thus forming a Central and East European federation called &quot;Intermarium&quot; (Polish: &quot;Międzymorze&quot;, literally &quot;area between seas&quot;). Lenin, leader of the new communist government of Russia, saw Poland as the bridge over which communism would pass into the labor class of a disorganized postwar Germany. And the issue was further complicated as some of the disputed regions had assumed various economic and political identities since the partition in the late 18th century while some did not have an ethnically Polish majority in the first place they were still viewed by Poles as their historic regions since they envisioned Poland as a multiethnic state. In the end, the negotiations broke down, sinking Piłsudski&#x27;s idea of Międzymorze federation; instead, wars like the Polish-Lithuanian War or the Polish-Ukrainian War decided the borders of the region for the next two decades.

The Polish-Soviet war, began in 1919, was the most important of the regional wars. Piłsudski first carried out a major military thrust into Ukraine in 1920 and in May Polish-Ukrainian forces reached Kiev. Just a few weeks later, however, the Polish offensive was met with a Soviet counter-offensive, and Polish forces were forced into a retreat by the Red Army. Poland was driven out of Ukraine and back into the Polish heartland. Most observers at the time marked Poland for extinction and Bolshevization, However at the Battle of Warsaw Piłsudski organized a stunning counterattack that won a famous victory. This &quot;Miracle on the Vistula&quot; became an iconic victory in Polish memory. Piłsudski resumed the offensive, pushing the Red forces east. Eventually, both sides, exhausted, signed a compromise peace treaty at Riga in early 1921 that divided the disputed territories of Belarus and Ukraine between the two combatants. These acquisitions were recognized by the international agreement with the Entente. The treaty gave Poland an eastern border well beyond what the peacemakers in Paris had envisioned and added 4,000,000 Ukrainians, 2,000,000 Jews, and 1,000,000 Belarusians to Poland&#x27;s minority population.

In Soviet historiography, the Polish-Soviet War was also referred to as a &quot;war against White Poles&quot;, with the epithet &quot;belopoliaki&quot; (&quot;White Poles&quot;) smearing the Poles as &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; akin to the White Russians. In 1922, in the aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War and Polish-Lithuanian War, Poland officially annexed Central Lithuania following a plebiscite, which was never recognized by Lithuania. The Riga arrangement influenced the fate of the entire region for the years to come. Ukrainians and Belarusians found themselves without a country or province of their own, and some Polish speakers also found themselves within the borders of the Soviet Union. The latter experienced forced collectivistion, state terror, suppression of religion, purges, labor camps and famine. The newly formed Second Polish Republic, one-third of whose citizens were non-ethnic Poles, engaged in promoting Polish identity, culture and language at the expense of the country&#x27;s ethnic minorities who felt alienated by the process.

==From democracy to authoritarian government==

Reborn Poland faced a host of daunting challenges: extensive war damage, a ravaged economy, a population one-third composed of wary national minorities, an economy largely under the control of German industrial interests, and a need to reintegrate the three zones that had been forcibly kept apart during the era of partition. Poland&#x27;s formal political life began in 1921 with the adoption of a constitution that designed Poland as a republic modeled after the French Third Republic, vesting most authority in the legislature, the Sejm. This was mainly to prevent Piłsudski from establishing himself as a dictator. A multitude of political parties emerged, of which there were four major and dozens of minor ones. All had very different ideologies and voter bases, and could scarcely agree on any major issue. There had been no serious consideration of re-establishing a monarchy, and although the great Polish noble families continued to have their names mentioned in newspapers, it was mostly in the society pages. The chief parties were the left-wing Polish Peasant Party (PSL) and on the right National Democracy party (ND) led by Dmowski.
The new, inexperienced government faced serious problems; already there was rampant corruption among government officials; a dizzying turnover of cabinets caused confusion and distrust. At a deeper level there was profound disagreement about inclusiveness in the new state. Roman Dmowski envisioned an ethnically-homogeneous Polish nation, and a pro-Western, anti-German path to modernization; he also espoused strong anti-Semitic attitudes, and emphasized that Poland should be a Catholic and hierarchical state. Piłsudski, however, rooted his ideal in notions about the multi-ethnic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In practice that meant ignoring the minority vote at home and seeking agreements with nearby countries. Universal suffrage gave the minorities a voice, especially when they formed a coalition, the Bloc of National Minorities (BMN) led by the Jews and including the others who together comprised a third of the population and 20% of the vote. However, the districts were gerrymandered to minimize minority representation. The BMN helped elect Gabriel Narutowicz as president on the PSL ticket in 1922, but he came under nasty attacks from the right and was assassinated after five days in office. The BMN coalition declined in significance and shut down in 1930 as the different groups cut their own deals with the government on isolated issues.

===Coup of 1926===

After the constitution was adopted, Piłsudski resigned from office, unhappy with the limited role of the executive branch. But he continued to keep a close eye on political developments. The ineffectiveness of the Sejm led some of his inner circle to suggest that he launch a military coup and regain power; he said no. By 1926 he was persuaded and launched the coup of May 1926, which succeeded with little violence. For the next decade, Piłsudski dominated Polish affairs as strongman of a generally popular centrist government, although he never held a formal title except for minister of defense. He retained the 1921 constitution, and the noisy, ineffective Sejm continued to operate, but it nearly always gave him what he wanted. Critics of the government were occasionally arrested, but most were sued for libel. The marshal portrayed himself as a national saviour who was above partisan politics and gained more popular support by distancing himself from the Polish Socialist Party. In 1935 a new Polish Constitution was adopted, but Piłsudski soon died and his protégé successors drifted toward open authoritarianism. Opposition voices were increasingly harassed or jailed, a situation that was not surprising in view of the government&#x27;s growing fears over national security. In many respects, the Second Republic fell short of the high expectations of 1918. As happened elsewhere in Central Europe, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, the attempt to implant democracy did not succeed. Governments polarized between right- and left-wing factions, neither of which was prepared to honor the actions taken by the other.

===Economic and social problems===
Serious difficulties arose in dealing with foreign assets and internal minorities. The government nationalized foreign-owned assets and operated them because there was insufficient domestic capital to buy them and because it was easier than determining who should get what. Overall, Poland had a higher degree of state involvement in the economy and less foreign investment than any other nation in eastern Europe. This emphasis on economic centralization hampered Poland&#x27;s development. The economy was largely rural, and the worldwide Great Depression that began in 1929 saw hardship in every sector. Worst hit were the peasants whose incomes plunged 50% or more. The government had few solutions except to reduce its own spending as tax revenues fell.

====Minorities====
About a third of the total population were members of minorities, including five or six million Ukrainians, over three million Jews, one and a half million Belarusians, and some 800,000 Germans. These minorities were increasingly alienated, complaining that they were marginalized in politics and denied rights Poland had agreed to in treaties. Historian Peter D. Stachura has examined the ethnic issue in interwar Poland and summarizes the consensus of historians, he writes:
:&quot;It is undeniable that the Second Republic did not face any greater challenge than that of devising a policy towards the minorities that would bring harmony and peaceful coexistence rather than bitterness, confrontation and strife. The historiographical verdict is that Poland signally failed to address this question in a satisfactory manner. Indeed, the vast majority of historians have adopted a highly censorious attitude towards the multitude of policies and attitudes which were pursued towards the minorities by the state. Often influenced by Communist, Marxist, Soviet or liberal political and ideological perspectives, they refer unequivocally to &#x27;oppression&#x27;, &#x27;persecution&#x27;, &#x27;terror&#x27;, &#x27;discrimination&#x27;, even &#x27;murder&#x27;, as the salient characteristics of an intrinsically chauvinistic Polish approach that was designed to relegate the minorities to the status of second-class citizens. Such a situation, it is argued, meant that Poland failed repeatedly to respect the formal statutory guarantees which were introduced after 1918, notably through the Minorities&#x27; Treaty of 1919, the Treaty of Riga (Article VII) in 1921, and the Polish constitutions of 1921 and 1935.&quot;

Stachura himself thinks that historians have been too harsh in their negative judgment. He notes that Poland had to contend with &quot;an obstreperous and fundamentally disloyal German minority&quot; that was incited by &quot;fanatical&quot; German nationalists next door. Poles talked of forced assimilation and seizure of industrial assets, but the governments before 1926 were too weak to carry them out. After 1926 Piłsudski had no interest in so doing. The Germans in Poland had above-average incomes, had a full panoply of civic organizations and German-language schools, and were represented in the Sejm. A stalemate resulted. Their status became a major threat after Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, because &quot;the overwhelming majority of these Germans became ardent Nazis in the 1930s and a &#x27;fifth column&#x27; when Poland was attacked in September 1939.&quot;

Relations with the much larger Ukrainian minority, who formed 15% or so of the national population and were in the majority in several eastern provinces, were even more strained. The Ukrainians were poor peasants who resented their Polish landlords and the government&#x27;s policy of polonizing them. The schools after 1924 were bilingual (students had to learn Polish), and government offices were not allowed to use Ukrainian. Some Ukrainians tried to sabotage, and the government cracked down with mass arrests; it tolerated the Polish arson of Ukrainian community centers. Orthodox churches were closed, especially in Volhynia province. Some men went underground and tried to assassinate Ukrainians who collaborated with the government, as well as top Polish officials. A compromise was reached in 1935 that somewhat quieted the situation, but the Polish Army saw a war with the USSR looming and refused to support the policy.

As the Great Depression worsened in the 1930s, antisemitism began to rise even though Poland was home to over three million Jews (10 percent of Poland&#x27;s population), the largest Jewish population in Europe at the time. The impoverished Jewish families relied on their own local charities, which by 1929 had reached unprecedented proportions, providing services such as religion, education, health and other services to the value of 200 million zlotys a year, thanks in part to Jewish &quot;per capita&quot; income among the working Jews more than 40% higher than that of Polish non-Jews. From the 1920s the Polish government excluded Jews from receiving government bank credits, public sector employment, and obtaining business licenses. From the 1930s limits were placed on Jewish enrollment in university education, Jewish shops, Jewish export firms, Shechita, Jewish admission to the medical and legal professions, Jews in business associations, etc. While in 1921-22 25% of students were Jews, by 1938-9 the proportion went down to 8%. The far-right National Democracy (Endeks) organized anti-Jewish boycotts. Following the death of Poland&#x27;s ruler Józef Piłsudski in 1935, the Endeks intensified their efforts. In 1937 the Endeks passed resolutions that &quot;its main aim and duty must be to remove the Jews from all spheres of social, economic, and cultural life in Poland&quot;. The government in response organized the Camp of National Unity (OZON); OZON advocated mass emigration of Jews from Poland, boycott of Jews, numerus clausus (see also Ghetto benches), and other limitation on Jewish rights. At the same time the Polish government supported the Zionist Irgun, training its members in Tatra Mountains and in 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the Jewish underground in Palestine, capable of arming up to 10,000 men. On international arena Poland supported the creation of Jewish state in Palestine hoping gradual emigration over next 30 years will lower Jewish population in Poland to 500,000 and cooperated with the leader of Revisionist Zionism, Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky who hoped Poland would inherit the mandate of Palestine from Great Britain; his &quot;Evacuation Plan&quot; called for the settlement of 1.5 million Jews within 10 years in Palestine, including 750,000 Polish Jews This idea was warmly received by the Polish government which pursued a policy of mass emigration towards its Jewish population and was looking for locations for them to resettle; Jabotinsky on his part viewed antisemitism in Poland as a result of the shortage of jobs and of the economic situation, rather than rabid racism as was in Nazi Germany

===Agrarianism===
Seven out of ten of the people worked on farms as peasants. Polish agriculture suffered from the usual handicaps of Eastern European nations: technological backwardness, low productivity, and lack of capital and access to markets. The former German areas in the west had better rainfall and soil quality and were the most productive, while the former Russian and Austrian areas were below-average. The Polish peasantry believed that it would be so much better if they owned their land and did not pay rents to a landowner. They endorsed agrarianism and called for land redistribution away from large estates to peasants. This was done and also many very small farms were consolidated into viable units. Land reforms were undertaken along ethnic lines. In the west, Germans who had been made foreigners in 1919 quickly lost their land. In the east, by contrast, Ukrainian and Belarusian peasants tilled for Polish landowners and no serious moves toward land redistribution were taken. No alternative industrial jobs were developed and underemployment was high in rural areas.

The socialist politician Bolesław Limanowski thought deeply about Agrarianism and worked out an eclectic program that fit Polish conditions. His practical experience as a farm manager combined with socialist, &quot;single-tax,&quot; and Slavic communal ideas shaped his worldview. He proposed a form of agrarian socialism with large state farms to counteract the inefficiency of very smallholdings. In independent Poland, he advocated expropriation of gentry estates. His observation of peasant individualism convinced him that Poland should combine voluntary collectivism and individual possession of the leased land. His pragmatism left the room even for private peasant ownership, despite his Marxism.

== International relations ==

Foreign minister Józef Beck was in full charge of foreign policy by 1935 but he had a weak hand. Poland with 35 million people had a large population but a thin industrial base; its war plans focused on the Soviet Union instead of Germany. Poland had long borders with two more powerful dictatorships, Hitler&#x27;s Germany and Stalin&#x27;s USSR. Poland was increasingly isolated. Overy says that of all the new states in Europe:
:&quot;Poland was almost certainly the most disliked and her Foreign Minister the most distrusted. Poland&#x27;s pursuit of an independent line left her bereft of any close friends by the end of 1938... The Western powers saw Poland as a greedy revisionist power, illiberal, anti-Semitic, pro-German; Beck was a &#x27;menace,&#x27; &#x27;arrogant and treacherous.&#x27;&quot;

In February 1921, Poland signed a secret military agreement with France, which obliged each party to mutual aid in the event of German aggression. In March 1921, the Poles signed a treaty of mutual assistance with Romania, directed against the threat from the Soviet Union. Poland sought to be the leader of an independent bloc of nations between the Soviet Union and Germany that would unite to fend them off. However, Poland ran into so many disputes with its smaller neighbors that it was never able to build a bloc. At first, France favored Poland, because France wanted an ally against Germany; if Germany faced a two-front war, it would be less likely to attack France. France was especially helpful at the 1919 Paris conference and in the 1920s when it resisted British efforts to weaken Poland. After 1935, however, France distrusted Beck and lost interest in Eastern Europe and Poland stood increasingly alone.

In 1925, Berlin formally recognized its post-1918 boundaries in the west with France, but not in the east with Poland. The same year, Germany slashed coal imports from Poland by half, which triggered the German–Polish trade war. Relations with the Soviet Union remained hostile, but Piłsudski was willing to negotiate, and in 1932 the two countries 
signed a non-aggression pact.
Shortly afterward, Hitler came to power. Rumors circulated to the effect that Piłsudski proposed to France that Poland and France launch a preemptive military strike to overthrow Hitler in 1933. Most historians do not believe this happened, pointing out that Piłsudski&#x27;s war plans were focused on Russia and he made no preparations for any sort of war with Germany. Furthermore, no one in France reported any such inquiry from Poland. Piłsudski made demands regarding Danzig that Hitler immediately approved; relations between Poland and Nazi Germany became friendly and they signed the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact in January 1934. At the same time, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia were allied in the Little Entente with French support. Polish membership there could have provided additional security; however, relations with Prague were unfriendly due to border disputes, so they never reached an agreement.

France was an ally of both Poland and Czechoslovakia and tried repeatedly to get them to resolve their border disputes and become allies, and also collaborate with the Soviet Union. There was no success, not just because of the border issues but also because Prague&#x27;s willingness to work with Moscow clashed with the firm resolve of Warsaw to keep its distance from Moscow. Czechoslovakian President Edvard Beneš warned that military or even strong political ties with Poland could prove dangerous for Czechoslovakia and rebuffed Beck&#x27;s proposal to establish anti-German cooperation. The failure to establish any alliances in Eastern Europe meant the only ally was France; Piłsudski increasingly doubted the value of that alliance. The Locarno Pact, signed in 1925 by the major West European powers with the aim of guaranteeing peace in the region, contained no guarantee of Poland&#x27;s western border.

In May 1934, the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact was extended until 31 December 1945. According to Anna M. Cienciala, during the period 1934–1939, Polish-Soviet relations were &quot;correct but cool&quot;, while Polish-German relations could be characterized as &quot;normal and at times friendly&quot;.

===Military capabilities===
The budget for the year 1934-35 allocated 762 million zlotych for the army, about 32% of the total. It provided for an effective strength of 7,905 officers, 37,000 professional soldiers, and 211,110 militia soldiers. Apart from the army, the budget provided 105 million zlotych for police troops consisting of 774 officers and 28,592 men. By 1939 Poland had a large army, with 283,000 on active duty, in 37 infantry divisions, 11 cavalry brigades, and two armored brigades, plus artillery units. Another 700,000 men served in the reserves. A major problem was lack of funds. The limited defense budget allowed minimal mechanization; most weapons were produced in Poland, but the production rate was low (7TP tank is a prime example), and foreign exchange was scarce.
The fact that Poland was halfway through the rearming process that was to end in 1942 did not help. Ten divisions were never mobilized. The cancellation of the mobilization, under the pressure from France and Great Britain, and restarting the mobilization less than a week later created confusion. Moreover, not only did the German military and civilian volunteers commit war crimes against the ethnic Poles and Polish Jews, they spread rumors of massive ethnic cleansing which led thousands of people to flee the German advance and made military maneuver difficult.

Poland did have PZL, the state aviation company that made good planes. In 1931 it developed the PZL P.11, the most advanced fighter in the world of the early 1930s. In the mid-1930s its successor the P-24 was even better armed and faster, but Poland exported it to earn currency, forcing the use of semi-obsolete PZL P.11 and a couple of dozen old PZL P.7 fighters. They were no match against the German Messerschmitt 109 which could fly higher, was better armed, and flew 100 km/h faster. In spite of the shortcomings, at least 110 victories were credited to the P.11 for the loss of about 30 of their own. The PZL.37 Łoś was an excellent twin-engine medium bomber; Poland had 36 ready-to-fight when the war started. In 1939 Poland had 390 combat planes that were mostly obsolescent. Germany had 2800 new fighter planes plus bombers and transports.

The Poles, in spite of their desperate situation, managed to win two battles against the invading Soviets, including one where the Soviet infantry was charging the Polish positions marching shoulder to shoulder, making them into an extremely easy target to the machine guns, and some of the Soviet POW&#x27;s switched sides to the Polish. Poles broke the early diplomatic version of Enigma cipher and transferred the results to France and the United Kingdom. 

In spite of its shortcomings, the Polish military can easily be ranked in the top 10 strongest national militaries as of 1939; not because the Polish military was so great, but because other national military forces were so weak and backward. Zaloga and Madej point out, in &quot;The Polish Campaign 1939&quot; that Poland had one of the largest tank forces on Earth, as of 1939 bigger than the tank force of the US. The relative strength of the Polish armed forces and the fear of the Polish military might be shown by Lithuania&#x27;s acceptance of the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania; Poland&#x27;s military strength made the Polish government&#x27;s propaganda believable to the public. The Polish government had no choice, but to claim that an attack either by the Germans or by the Soviets would have been successfully repelled. The Polish government could not afford a capitulation of the Polish public because of the industrialization projects such as Central Industrial Region (Poland), nearly finished by early 1939, and the projects that were to follow it.

===Foreign policy 1935–39===

After the death of Piłsudski in May 1935, policies in Poland were set by five senior officials, including President Ignacy Mościcki; Vice-President Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski; the Premier, Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski; and Marshal Edward Smigly-Rydz, the Commander-in-Chief of the army. Foreign policy was the exclusive domain of the Foreign Minister, Colonel Józef Beck. Elections were held but there was no democracy and the Sejm was merely a rubber stamp. Watt notes that these men had emerged victorious from their struggles for independence and had never known conquest. &quot;Courage, flair, heroism, devouring ambition, all these they had in abundance; realism and worst-case analysis, let alone defeatism or appeasement, were alien to them entirely.&quot;

Poland&#x27;s dream of leading a bloc of neutral nations in Eastern Europe collapsed after 1933 with the advent of Hitler&#x27;s expansionism and the obvious warning of France&#x27;s desire to resist Germany&#x27;s expansion. Piłsudski retained the French connection but had progressively less faith in its usefulness. Hitler&#x27;s long-term goals included annexing Polish territories and subordinating the remaining parts of Poland, an idea that he revealed to his closest circle already in 1933 Poland&#x27;s solution was a policy of normal relations with both Germany and the Soviet Union but alliance with neither (also described as &quot;the policy of equal distance&quot; or &quot;equilibrium&quot;). Accordingly, the Polish leadership rejected German proposals of cooperation against Russia. At the same time, Beck&#x27;s goal was to prevent Poland from entering into an isolated conflict with Germany. The policy rested on two pillars: the non-aggression pacts signed by Poland with Germany and the USSR.

Following a border incident in March 1938, Poland presented an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and Lithuania and the previously closed border with Poland to be reopened. Faced with the threat of war, the Lithuanian government accepted the Polish demands. In October 1938, the Munich Agreement, with British and French approval, allowed Germany to take over areas of Czechoslovakia with a significant German minority, the so-called Sudetenland. Poland had long been hostile to Czechoslovakia and now sided with Germany. Poland demanded that Czechoslovakia give up the Teschen, where Poles made about 70% of inhabitants, or otherwise Poland threatened to take it by force. Faced with an ultimatum from both Poland and Germany, Czechoslovakia gave up the area, which was annexed by Poland on October 2, 1938.

In early 1939, Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia, which, in March 1939, then ceased to exist. Germany had demanded that Poland join the Anti-Comintern Pact as a satellite state of Germany. Germany demanded an extraterritorial highway connecting Germany proper with Danzig and then East Prussia, which would cut off Poland from the sea and its main trade route to which Poland refused. Germany also pressed for the incorporation of Danzig, a Nazi ruled city-state with a 90% German population that had been separated from Germany in 1920 and functioning as a Free City in a customs union with Poland ever since.

After it rejected German territorial demands regarding Danzig and Gdańsk Pomerania, Poland&#x27;s position was steadily weakening as other nations such as Hungary and Romania gravitated toward Germany&#x27;s orbit. Poland was at the time allied with Romania and France. Two critical developments caught Poland by surprise. At the end of March 1939, Britain and France announced that if Germany invaded Poland they would declare war. In terms of helping Poland in an actual war, everyone realized they could do very little. The hope was that the threat of a two-front war would deter Germany, especially since it had to worry about the role of the Soviet Union. Hitler thought Britain and France were bluffing, but he handled the Soviet problem in late August, by a stunning agreement with Stalin in what amounted to a friendly alliance, which included secret provisions to partition Poland—and indeed divide up much of eastern Europe The British and French offer was not a bluff—they declared war on Germany when it invaded Poland, but neither was in a position to provide serious help. Poland itself had a million-man army (and another million in the reserves) but fell far short in terms of training, airpower, artillery, tanks, machine guns, radios, and trucks. The Polish military budget was about 2% of Germany&#x27;s; its commanding general Marshal Smigly-Rydz was not well prepared for the challenge.

===Polish Corridor and Danzig===
The Germans wanted restoration of the pre-Versailles Treaty borders and so they launched new demands on Poland. They insisted on a plebiscite to determine the ownership of the &quot;Polish corridor&quot;. Only those living in the corridor prior to 1918 would be allowed to vote. The proposal called for a subsequent population exchange that would move all Germans, then in Poland, out of the final region declared to be &quot;Poland&quot;. The same would occur for all Poles living in what was declared, after the vote, to be &quot;Germany&quot;. Danzig was to become part of Germany regardless of the vote, but if Germany lost, it was still guaranteed access to East Prussia through an autobahn system that it would administer, stretching from Germany proper to Danzig to East Prussia. If Poland lost the vote, the corridor would go to Germany and the seaport of Gdynia would become a Polish exclave with a route connecting Poland with Gdynia. After the British-French guarantee of support for Poland was announced on April 3, negotiations over Danzig ended. Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. The issue of Danzig was not the cause of the German invasion; Hitler told his generals in May 1939: “It is not Danzig that is at stake. For us, it is a matter of expanding our living space in the east and making food supplies secure.” The total destruction of the Polish state, Polish culture, and indeed the Polish population had become Hitler&#x27;s main objective. He wanted the agricultural land to resettle German farmers.

<text>Occasionalism is a philosophical doctrine about causation which says that created substances cannot be efficient causes of events. Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by God. (A related concept, which has been called &quot;occasional causation&quot;, also denies a link of efficient causation between mundane events, but may differ as to the identity of the true cause that replaces them.) The doctrine states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of God&#x27;s causing of one event after another. However, there is no necessary connection between the two: it is not that the first event &quot;causes&quot; God to cause the second event: rather, God first causes one and then causes the other.

== Islamic theological schools ==
The doctrine first reached prominence in the Islamic theological schools of Iraq, especially in Basra. The ninth century theologian Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari argued that there is no Secondary Causation in the created order. The world is sustained and governed through direct intervention of a divine primary causation. As such the world is in a constant state of recreation by God. In the Arabic language this was known as &quot;Kasb&quot;.

The most famous proponent of the Asharite occasionalist doctrine was Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali, an 11th-century theologian based in Baghdad. In &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;, Al-Ghazali launched a philosophical critique against Neoplatonic-influenced early Islamic philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina. In response to the philosophers&#x27; claim that the created order is governed by secondary efficient causes (God being, as it were, the Primary and Final Cause in an ontological and logical sense), Ghazali argues that what we observe as regularity in nature based presumably upon some natural law is actually a kind of constant and continual regularity. There is no independent necessitation of change and becoming, other than what God has ordained. To posit an independent causality outside of God&#x27;s knowledge and action is to deprive him of true agency, and diminish his attribute of power. In his famous example, when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned not because of the heat of the fire, but through God&#x27;s direct intervention, a claim which he defended using logic. In the 12th century, the Islamic theologian Fakhr al-Din al-Razi expounded upon similar theories of occasionalism in his works.

Because God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, his behaviour in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the laws of nature. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern his own behaviour (his autonomy, in the strict sense) — in other words, his rational will. This is not, however, an essential element of an occasionalist account, and occasionalism can include positions where God&#x27;s behaviour (and thus that of the world) is viewed as ultimately inscrutable, thus maintaining God&#x27;s essential transcendence. On this understanding, apparent anomalies such as miracles are not really such: they are simply God behaving in a way that &quot;appears&quot; unusual &quot;to us&quot;. Given his transcendent freedom, he is not bound even by his own nature. Miracles, as breaks in the rational structure of the universe, can occur, since God&#x27;s relationship with the world is not mediated by rational principles.

In a 1978 article in &quot;Studia Islamica&quot;, Lenn Goodman asks the question, &quot;Did Al-Ghazâlî Deny Causality?&quot; and demonstrates that Ghazali did not deny the existence of observed, &quot;worldly&quot; causation. According to Goodman&#x27;s analysis, Ghazali does not claim that there is never any link between observed cause and observed effect: rather, Ghazali argues that there is no &quot;necessary&quot; link between observed cause and effect.

== Dualism ==
One of the motivations for the theory is the dualist belief that mind and matter are so utterly different in their essences that one cannot affect the other. Thus, a person&#x27;s mind cannot be the true cause of his hand&#x27;s moving, nor can a physical wound be the true cause of mental anguish. In other words, the mental cannot cause the physical and vice versa. Also, occasionalists generally hold that the physical cannot cause the physical either, for no necessary connection can be perceived between physical causes and effects. The will of God is taken to be necessary.

The doctrine is, however, more usually associated with certain seventeenth century philosophers of the Cartesian school. There are hints of an occasionalist viewpoint here and there in Descartes&#x27;s own writings, but these can mostly be explained away under alternative interpretations. However, many of his later followers quite explicitly committed themselves to an occasionalist position. In one form or another, the doctrine can be found in the writings of: Johannes Clauberg, Claude Clerselier, Gerauld de Cordemoy, Arnold Geulincx, Louis de La Forge, François Lamy, and (most notably) Nicolas Malebranche.

== Hume&#x27;s arguments, Berkeley and Leibniz ==
These occasionalists&#x27; negative argument, that no necessary connections could be discovered between mundane events, was anticipated by certain arguments of Nicholas of Autrecourt in the fourteenth century, and were later taken up by David Hume in the eighteenth century. Hume, however, stopped short when it came to the positive side of the theory, where God was called upon to replace such connections, complaining that &quot;We are got into fairy land [...] Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses.&quot; Instead, Hume felt that the only place to find necessary connections was in the subjective associations of ideas within the mind itself. George Berkeley was also inspired by the occasionalists, and he agreed with them that no efficient power could be attributed to bodies. For Berkeley, bodies merely existed as ideas in percipient minds, and all such ideas were, as he put it, &quot;visibly inactive&quot;. However, Berkeley disagreed with the occasionalists by continuing to endow the created minds themselves with efficient power. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz agreed with the occasionalists that there could be no efficient causation between distinct created substances, but he did not think it followed that there was no efficient power in the created world at all. On the contrary, every simple substance had the power to produce changes in &quot;itself&quot;. The illusion of transient efficient causation, for Leibniz, arose out of the pre-established harmony between the alterations produced immanently within different substances. Leibniz means, that if God did not exist, &quot;there would be nothing real in the possibilities, not only nothing existent, but also nothing possible&quot;.

== Quantum mechanics ==
In 1993, Pierce College chemistry professor Karen Harding published the paper &quot;Causality Then and Now: Al Ghazali and Quantum Theory&quot; that described several &quot;remarkable&quot; similarities between Ghazali&#x27;s concept of occasionalism and the widely accepted Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. She stated: &quot;In both cases, and contrary to common sense, objects are viewed as having no inherent properties and no independent existence. In order for an object to exist, it must be brought into being either by God (al-Ghazali) or by an observer (the Copenhagen Interpretation).&quot; She also stated:
Continuing from philosopher Graham Harman&#x27;s work on occasionalism in the context of object-oriented ontology, Simon Weir proposed in 2020 an alternate view of the relationship between quantum theory and occasionalism opposed to the Copenhagen interpretation, where virtual particles act as one of many kinds of mediating sensual objects.

<doc id="340240" wikidata="Q381060" url="?curid=340240" title="Partition of a set">
<text>In mathematics, a partition of a set is a grouping of its elements into non-empty subsets, in such a way that every element is included in exactly one subset.

Every equivalence relation on a set defines a partition of this set, and every partition defines an equivalence relation. A set equipped with an equivalence relation or a partition is sometimes called a setoid, typically in type theory and proof theory.

== Definition and notation ==
A partition of a set &quot;X&quot; is a set of non-empty subsets of &quot;X&quot; such that every element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; is in exactly one of these subsets (i.e., the subsets are nonempty mutually disjoint sets).

Equivalently, a family of sets &quot;P&quot; is a partition of &quot;X&quot; if and only if all of the following conditions hold:
*The family &quot;P&quot; does not contain the empty set (that is formula_1).
*The union of the sets in &quot;P&quot; is equal to &quot;X&quot; (that is formula_2). The sets in &quot;P&quot; are said to exhaust or cover &quot;X&quot;. See also collectively exhaustive events and cover (topology).
* The intersection of any two distinct sets in &quot;P&quot; is empty (that is formula_3). The elements of &quot;P&quot; are said to be pairwise disjoint or mutually exclusive. See also mutual exclusivity.

The sets in formula_4 are called the &quot;blocks&quot;, &quot;parts&quot;, or &quot;cells&quot;, of the partition. If formula_5 then we represent the cell containing formula_6 by formula_7. That is to say, formula_7 is notation for the cell in formula_4 which contains formula_6. 

Every partition formula_4 may be identified with an equivalence relation on formula_12, namely the relation formula_13 such that for any formula_14 we have formula_15 if and only if formula_16 (equivalently, if and only if formula_17). The notation formula_13 evokes the idea that the equivalence relation may be constructed from the partition. Conversely every equivalence relation may be identified with a partition. This is why it is sometimes said informally that &quot;an equivalence relation is the same as a partition&quot;. If &quot;P&quot; is the partition identified with a given equivalence relation formula_19, then some authors write formula_20. This notation is suggestive of the idea that the partition is the set &quot;X&quot; divided in to cells. The notation also evokes the idea that, from the equivalence relation one may construct the partition.

The rank of formula_4 is formula_22, if formula_12 is finite.

== Examples ==
*The empty set formula_24 has exactly one partition, namely formula_24. (Note: this is the partition, not a member of the partition.)
*For any non-empty set &quot;X&quot;, &quot;P&quot; = is a partition of &quot;X&quot;, called the trivial partition.
**Particularly, every singleton set {&quot;x&quot;} has exactly one partition, namely .
*For any non-empty proper subset &quot;A&quot; of a set &quot;U&quot;, the set &quot;A&quot; together with its complement form a partition of &quot;U&quot;, namely, .
*The set has these five partitions (one partition per item):
** , sometimes written 1 | 2 | 3.
** , or 1 2 | 3.
** , or 1 3 | 2.
** , or 1 | 2 3.
** , or 123 (in contexts where there will be no confusion with the number).
*The following are not partitions of :
** is not a partition (of any set) because one of its elements is the empty set.
** is not a partition (of any set) because the element 2 is contained in more than one block.
** is not a partition of because none of its blocks contains 3; however, it is a partition of .

== Partitions and equivalence relations ==
For any equivalence relation on a set &quot;X&quot;, the set of its equivalence classes is a partition of &quot;X&quot;. Conversely, from any partition &quot;P&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, we can define an equivalence relation on &quot;X&quot; by setting precisely when &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are in the same part in &quot;P&quot;. Thus the notions of equivalence relation and partition are essentially equivalent.

The axiom of choice guarantees for any partition of a set &quot;X&quot; the existence of a subset of &quot;X&quot; containing exactly one element from each part of the partition. This implies that given an equivalence relation on a set one can select a canonical representative element from every equivalence class.

== Refinement of partitions ==

A partition &quot;α&quot; of a set &quot;X&quot; is a refinement of a partition &quot;ρ&quot; of &quot;X&quot;—and we say that &quot;α&quot; is &quot;finer&quot; than &quot;ρ&quot; and that &quot;ρ&quot; is &quot;coarser&quot; than &quot;α&quot;—if every element of &quot;α&quot; is a subset of some element of &quot;ρ&quot;. Informally, this means that &quot;α&quot; is a further fragmentation of &quot;ρ&quot;. In that case, it is written that &quot;α&quot; ≤ &quot;ρ&quot;.

This &quot;finer-than&quot; relation on the set of partitions of &quot;X&quot; is a partial order (so the notation &quot;≤&quot; is appropriate). Each set of elements has a least upper bound (their &quot;join&quot;) and a greatest lower bound (their &quot;meet&quot;), so that it forms a lattice, and more specifically (for partitions of a finite set) it is a geometric and supersolvable lattice. The &quot;partition lattice&quot; of a 4-element set has 15 elements and is depicted in the Hasse diagram on the left.

The meet and join of partitions α and ρ are defined as follows. The meet formula_26 is the partition whose blocks are the intersections of a block of &quot;α&quot; and a block of &quot;ρ&quot;, except for the empty set. In other words, a block of formula_26 is the intersection of a block of &quot;α&quot; and a block of &quot;ρ&quot; that are not disjoint from each other. To define the join formula_28, form a relation on the blocks &quot;A&quot; of &quot;α&quot; and the blocks &quot;B&quot; of &quot;ρ&quot; by &quot;A&quot; ~ &quot;B&quot; if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are not disjoint. Then formula_28 is the partition in which each block &quot;C&quot; is the union of a family of blocks connected by this relation.

Based on the equivalence between geometric lattices and matroids, this lattice of partitions of a finite set corresponds to a matroid in which the base set of the matroid consists of the atoms of the lattice, namely, the partitions with formula_30 singleton sets and one two-element set. These atomic partitions correspond one-for-one with the edges of a complete graph. The matroid closure of a set of atomic partitions is the finest common coarsening of them all; in graph-theoretic terms, it is the partition of the vertices of the complete graph into the connected components of the subgraph formed by the given set of edges. In this way, the lattice of partitions corresponds to the lattice of flats of the graphic matroid of the complete graph.

Another example illustrates refinement of partitions from the perspective of equivalence relations. If &quot;D&quot; is the set of cards in a standard 52-card deck, the &quot;same-color-as&quot; relation on &quot;D&quot; – which can be denoted ~C – has two equivalence classes: the sets {red cards} and {black cards}. The 2-part partition corresponding to ~C has a refinement that yields the &quot;same-suit-as&quot; relation ~S, which has the four equivalence classes {spades}, {diamonds}, {hearts}, and {clubs}.

==Noncrossing partitions==
A partition of the set &quot;N&quot; = {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;} with corresponding equivalence relation ~ is noncrossing if it has the following property: If four elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; of &quot;N&quot; having &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot; &lt; &quot;d&quot; satisfy &quot;a&quot; ~ &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ~ &quot;d&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; ~ &quot;b&quot; ~ &quot;c&quot; ~ &quot;d&quot;. The name comes from the following equivalent definition: Imagine the elements 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot; of &quot;N&quot; drawn as the &quot;n&quot; vertices of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon (in counterclockwise order). A partition can then be visualized by drawing each block as a polygon (whose vertices are the elements of the block). The partition is then noncrossing if and only if these polygons do not intersect.

The lattice of noncrossing partitions of a finite set forms a subset of the lattice of all partitions, but not a sublattice, since the join operations of the two lattices do not agree.

The noncrossing partition lattice has taken on importance because of its role in free probability theory.

== Counting partitions ==
The total number of partitions of an &quot;n&quot;-element set is the Bell number &quot;Bn&quot;. The first several Bell numbers are &quot;B&quot;0 = 1,
&quot;B&quot;1 = 1, &quot;B&quot;2 = 2, &quot;B&quot;3 = 5, &quot;B&quot;4 = 15, &quot;B&quot;5 = 52, and &quot;B&quot;6 = 203 . Bell numbers satisfy the recursion

: formula_31

and have the exponential generating function

:formula_32
The Bell numbers may also be computed using the Bell triangle
in which the first value in each row is copied from the end of the previous row, and subsequent values are computed by adding two numbers, the number to the left and the number to the above left of the position. The Bell numbers are repeated along both sides of this triangle. The numbers within the triangle count partitions in which a given element is the largest singleton.

The number of partitions of an &quot;n&quot;-element set into exactly &quot;k&quot; (non-empty) parts is the Stirling number of the second kind &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;).

The number of noncrossing partitions of an &quot;n&quot;-element set is the Catalan number

<text>Mena Alexandra Suvari (; born February 13, 1979) is an American actress, producer, fashion designer and model. The accolades she has received include a Screen Actors Guild Award, along with nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and a BAFTA Award.

After beginning her career as a model and guest-starring on several television shows, Suvari made her film debut in the 1997 black comedy drama &quot;Nowhere&quot;. She rose to international prominence with her appearances as Angela in the critically acclaimed comedy-drama &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), for which she received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and Heather in three of the &quot;American Pie&quot; films (1999–2001, 2012). Her other notable lead film roles include &quot;Slums of Beverly Hills&quot; (1998), &quot;Loser&quot; (2000), &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot; (2001), &quot;The Musketeer&quot; (2001), &quot;Spun&quot; (2003), &quot;Stuck&quot; (2007), &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; (2008), and &quot;You May Not Kiss the Bride&quot; (2010).

In television, Suvari played main roles as Maria Abascal on the We TV supernatural horror series &quot;South of Hell&quot; (2015) and Kathleen Callahan on the Paramount sitcom &quot;American Woman&quot; (2018). For her main role as Detective Thompson on the Gala Film short form series &quot;RZR&quot; (2024), Suvari was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series. Suvari played recurring roles as Edie on the fourth season of the HBO drama series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (2004), for which she earned a Screen Actors Guild nomination, and Isabella on the second season of &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; (2013). She also portrayed Elizabeth Short in the anthology series &quot;American Horror Story: Murder House&quot; (2011), and reprised the part in &quot;American Horror Story: Apocalypse&quot; (2018).
Suvari has been a model for Lancôme cosmetics and print ads for Lancôme Paris Adaptîve, as well as a long-time supporter and activist for the Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation and the African Medical and Research Foundation. She is married and has one child.

==Early life==
Suvari was born in Newport, Rhode Island. She is the daughter of nurse Candice (née Chambers) and psychiatrist Ando Ivar Süvari. Her mother is of Greek descent, while her father was an Estonian from Pärnu. She has six siblings. Suvari began modeling with Millie Lewis Models and Talent as a preteen and soon after appeared in a Rice-A-Roni commercial. The family later relocated to Charleston, South Carolina, where her brothers attended The Citadel. Suvari was considering becoming an archaeologist, astronaut, or doctor when a modeling agency stopped by her all-girls school, Ashley Hall, to offer classes. By the time she started acting, she had been modeling for the New York-based Wilhelmina agency for five years. Suvari relocated to California and attended Providence High School in Burbank, graduating in 1997.

==Career==
===1995–1998: Early acting credits===
Suvari began acting with guest appearances in television series such as &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; and &quot;ER&quot; at the ages of 15 and 16, respectively. She also appeared in a number of episodes of the show &quot;High Incident&quot;, and played a girl infected with HIV in a one-episode appearance in &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. She made the transition to film with the role of Zoe in the 1997 independent coming-of-age drama &quot;Nowhere&quot;, directed by Gregg Araki and co-starring James Duval, Rachel True, Heather Graham, and Ryan Phillippe. Also in 1997, she had a supporting part in the independent film &quot;Snide and Prejudice&quot;, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and had a brief part in the thriller &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot;, opposite Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. She next appeared in the independent dramedy &quot;Slums of Beverly Hills&quot;, as a teenaged neighbor of a Jewish girl struggling to grow up in the late 1970s. The film received a limited release, and has developed a cult following. Suvari met Natasha Lyonne on the set of &quot;Slums&quot;, with whom she would later appear in the &quot;American Pie&quot; films. She subsequently played a teenager who commits suicide in the horror sequel &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot; (1999), and appeared as the daughter of an NTSB investigator in the disaster thriller NBC miniseries &quot;Atomic Train&quot; (1999), although both productions were panned by critics.

===1999–2001: Breakthrough and award success===
Her breakthrough came in 1999, with significant roles in two highly successful films —the teen sex comedy &quot;American Pie&quot; and the drama &quot;American Beauty&quot;. In &quot;American Pie&quot;, she starred with Jason Biggs, Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, and Natasha Lyonne, portraying a virgin and innocent choir girl named Heather. While critical response was mixed, the film was a commercial success, grossing $235 million worldwide.

In &quot;American Beauty&quot;, directed by Sam Mendes and co-starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch, Suvari took on the role of Angela Hayes, a vain teenage girl who becomes the object of infatuation of a man experiencing a midlife crisis. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her character as &quot;stimulus enough for [Spacey&#x27;s character] to wake up out of a marriage-long coma and start considering life&#x27;s livelier possibilities&quot;. The film received widespread critical acclaim, and received the Academy Award for Best Picture. &quot;American Beauty&quot; made $356 million globally and earned Suvari a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Suvari and her &quot;American Beauty&quot; co-stars Wes Bentley and Thora Birch presented the 2000 Oscar for Best Documentary short subject.

Suvari subsequently reunited with Jason Biggs in the romantic comedy &quot;Loser&quot; (2000), playing the love interest of a small-town, intelligent man. A lukewarm critical and commercial reception greeted the film, but &quot;The New York Times&quot; found Suvari to be &quot;well matched with the handsome, unassuming Mr. Biggs. They&#x27;re attractive without being offensively cute, and their characters manage to be genuinely nice without seeming bland or phony&quot;. She and Biggs also appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; by American rock band Wheatus. The video was heavily based on their roles in &quot;Loser&quot;. She then starred in the satirical comedy &quot;American Virgin&quot;, as the daughter of an adult film director who agrees to lose her virginity onscreen to spite her father. The original working title of the film was &quot;Live Virgin&quot;, but was changed to capitalize on Suvari&#x27;s previous successes in &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;.

Suvari continued to act steadily, taking on roles in three 2001 feature films —&quot;The Musketeer&quot;, &quot;American Pie 2&quot; and &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot;. In the adventure action film &quot;The Musketeer&quot;, she played a chambermaid and the love interest of the titular character, while &quot;American Pie 2&quot; saw her reprise her role from the first film. Like the original, the sequel was a commercial success, grossing $285 million globally. In the teen crime comedy &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot;, Suvari portrayed one member of a group of cheerleaders who conspire and commit armed robbery. Although the film received negative reviews and only made $16.9 million worldwide, it has since become a cult favorite on home video.

===2002–2009: Independent films===
In &quot;Spun&quot; (2002), an independent dramedy opposite Brittany Murphy and John Leguizamo about drug abuse, Suvari played an addict and the girlfriend of a drug dealer (Leguizamo). She subsequently appeared as a prostitute working in a New Orleans brothel in the small-scale drama &quot;Sonny&quot; (2002), the directorial debut of Nicolas Cage co-starring James Franco and Brenda Blethyn, and also starred opposite Colin Firth in the psychological thriller &quot;Trauma&quot; (2004), as the neighbour of a man who awakens from a coma. &quot;Trauma&quot; premiered on the film festival circuit, receiving mediocre reviews from critics, who compared it unfavorably to &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; and &quot;Memento&quot;. In the fourth season of the acclaimed HBO serial &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, which aired in 2004, Suvari obtained the recurring role of a lesbian performance poet and artist named Edie. She and the cast eventually received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. She played supporting parts in five feature films the following year—&quot;Standing Still&quot;, &quot;Edmond&quot;, &quot;Rumor Has It&quot;, &quot;Domino&quot;, and &quot;Beauty Shop&quot;.
In 2006, Suvari voiced the character of Aerith Gainsborough for the Square Enix–Disney video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and the English-language version of Square Enix&#x27;s film &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot;, which was released straight-to-DVD in North America and became one of the best-selling animated movies in the country. Opposite Katherine Heigl, Suvari starred in the independent comedy &quot;Caffeine&quot; (2006), playing the staff of a London coffeehouse, and in the biographical drama &quot;Factory Girl&quot; (2006), she played a friend and roommate of 1960s underground film star and socialite Edie Sedgwick (played by Sienna Miller). While &quot;Caffeine&quot; went unnoticed, &quot;Factory Girl&quot; received a limited theatrical release amid a negative critical response.

In the crime drama &quot;Brooklyn Rules&quot; (2007), directed by Michael Corrente and co-starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Alec Baldwin and Scott Caan, Suvari portrayed a society girl and the girlfriend of a man involved with the Brooklyn mafia in the 1980s. The film was released for selected theaters and received mixed reviews, but &quot;Variety&quot; remarked that Suvari, &quot;who might have played [her part] as a cliché, gives a real performance&quot;. Her next film was the psychological thriller &quot;Stuck&quot;, where she took on the role of a woman who commits a hit-and-run and leaves the victim clinging to his life in the windshield of her car. Inspired by the true story of the murder of Gregory Glenn Biggs, the film premiered at the Cannes Film Market, and while &quot;Stuck&quot; found a limited theatrical release, it was favorably received by critics and audiences. &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; found the film to be &quot;buoyed by queasy, easy performances&quot; from Suvari and Rea, who were considered &quot;well-matched in uneasy roles&quot; by &quot;Empire&quot;.

By the late 2000s, Suvari continued to act in smaller-scale projects, obtaining four back-to-back roles in films released throughout 2008, including one made-for-television film. &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, a remake of George A. Romero&#x27;s horror film of the same name, saw her portray what was described as a &quot;butch military leader capable of fending off a zombie holocaust&quot;, by &quot;DVD Talk&quot;. The film received a straight-to-DVD release and was panned by critics. In &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot;, a film adaptation of writer Michael Chabon&#x27;s novel, Suvari played a strange girl who works at a book shop and becomes romantically involved with the well-mannered, intelligent son of a Jewish gangster. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and received a limited release. Website &quot;Collider&quot; felt that Suvari did a &quot;decent job&quot; in her &quot;small&quot; part, while Roger Ebert called her &quot;pitch-perfect&quot; in a &quot;finally thankless role&quot;, as part of a mixed critical reception.

&quot;The Garden of Eden&quot;, the film adaptation of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novel, featured Suvari as a sexually confused and restless woman and one half of a couple who travel across Europe amid a deteriorating marriage. She shaved her head for the part, but used three wigs for the in-between stages; on which she remarked: &quot;It was a bit strange. It was also very liberating at the same time [...] I am grateful for the experience I am happy that I got to do it at least once in my life. It was like its own psychological experiment. It was very empowering for me to go through and a challenging to experience how people perceive you&quot;. The film premiered at the Rome Film Festival and had a limited investors&#x27; screening in the UK. Reviews were negative for the film, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; calling it a &quot;literary B-side turned into something not awful, just forgettable&quot;. Her last 2008 film was the Lifetime production &quot;Sex and Lies in Sin City&quot;, about the events leading to the death of Las Vegas casino owner Ted Binion.

===2010–present: Television roles===
Suvari made one-episode appearances in &quot;Psych&quot; in 2010, and in &quot;The Cape&quot; in 2011, and also had a two-episode arc as the Black Dahlia in &quot;Murder House&quot;, the first season of the anthology horror series &quot;American Horror Story&quot;. In the independent romantic comedy &quot;You May Not Kiss the Bride&quot; (2010), opposite Dave Annable, Katharine McPhee and Rob Schneider, Suvari starred as the psychotic assistant of a pet photographer. The film debuted at the Sonoma International Film Festival and was released for selected theaters and VOD, garnering largely negative reviews. &quot;Blu-ray.com&quot; considered the film to be &quot;a noisy, unlikable distraction&quot; that &quot;depends on Suvari and Schneider to carry the comedy workload, which is about as appealing as it reads&quot;. In 2011, she also starred in the made-for-television film &quot;No Surrender&quot;, as a writer having a deranged stalker, and in the B movie &quot;Restitution&quot;, opposite Tom Arnold. She had a guest role in 2 episodes of &quot;American Horror Story: Murder House&quot; as Elizabeth Short, also known as Black Dahlia&quot;.&quot;
Suvari returned to the &quot;American Pie&quot; franchise when she played for the third time her role of Heather in &quot;American Reunion&quot; (2012), revolving around the original protagonists as they approach middle age and prepare for a summer reunion. Reviewers found the film to be a &quot;sweetly nostalgic comfort food&quot; for fans of the franchise, and with a worldwide gross of $235 million, &quot;American Reunion&quot; emerged as Suvari&#x27;s most-widely seen film since 2001&#x27;s &quot;American Pie 2&quot;. This film also marked her only wide release in the 2010s, as her later releases, such as &quot;The Knot&quot; (2012), &quot;Don&#x27;t Blink&quot; (2014), &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; (2014), &quot;Badge of Honor&quot; (2015), and &quot;Becks&quot; (2017), premiered on either festival circuits or digital markets.

In the romantic comedy &quot;The Knot&quot;, Suvari starred as the soon-to-be-married daughter of a working-class couple, and in the mystery thriller &quot;Don&#x27;t Blink&quot;, Suvari played one in a group of friends who visit an empty remote resort and attempt to find out what happened to the other guests. In its review for the latter film, &quot;FrightFest.co.uk&quot; remarked: &quot;[...] Suvari is wasted and not given a whole lot of screen time considering that her character is the one we&#x27;re obviously supposed to latch onto&quot;. Suvari starred opposite Geoff Stults and Kristin Chenoweth in the romantic comedy &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot;, as a young divorcee resenting men who meets a successful, driven attorney and womanizer. The small-scale thriller &quot;Badge of Honor&quot; saw her star as a detective caught up in the aftermath of a violent drug bust.

The independent romantic comedy &quot;Becks&quot; featured Suvari as the friend of a lesbian musician who moves back to St. Louis. Despite finding a limited audience, the film received positive reviews from critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that the film &quot;exemplifies how small judgments in pace, performance and soundtrack can transcend modest trappings&quot;, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; remarked: &quot;[Lena] Hall and Suvari have a palpable chemistry, both musically and in their relationship&quot;.

Suvari continued to work steadily on television between films and throughout the decade; she obtained the regular role of a political consultant of a firefighter in the second season of the series &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; (2013), and took on the leading role of a demon-hunter for hire in the eight-episode supernatural series &quot;South of Hell&quot; (2015). All episodes of the show aired back-to-back and an eighth episode was made available only through iTunes. The series received generally negative reviews and brought an average of 122,000 viewers. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, commenting on Suvari, asserted: &quot;[W]hile the prospect of playing [her role] seems like it ought to be enticing for Suvari, her more general interpretation appears to be closer to miserable discomfort, which may be related to either those contact lenses or the strangeness&quot; in her portrayal.

Between 2016 and 2017, Suvari made guest appearances in the television series &quot;Inside Amy Schumer&quot;, &quot;Justice League Action&quot;, and &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;, and starred in the made-for-television films &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot; and &quot;&quot;, where she reprised her guest-starring role from the series and basis of the film. The sitcom &quot;American Woman&quot; features Suvari in a main role as one of three women discovering their own brand of independence amid the rise of second-wave feminism in the 1970s. The series premiered on June 8, 2018, on Paramount Network. The series was canceled after one season. Suvari reprised her role as Black Dahlia in an episode of &quot;American Horror Story: Apocalypse&quot;.

In 2024, Suvari had a main role as Detective Thompson on the Gala Film short form science fiction series &quot;RZR&quot;. For her performance, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series, marking the first Emmy nomination in her career. She portrayed Jane Wyman in a supporting role in the 2024 biographical film &quot;Reagan&quot;.
