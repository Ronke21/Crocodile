<text>The red-breasted sapsucker (Sphyrapicus ruber) is a medium-sized woodpecker of the forests of the west coast of North America.

==Taxonomy==
The red-breasted sapsucker was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the woodpeckers in the genus &quot;Picus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Picus ruber&quot;. The specific epithet is Latin meaning &quot;red&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;red-breasted woodpecker&quot; that had been described in 1782 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham mistakenly believed that his specimen had come from Cayenne in French Guiana. The type locality has been designated as Nootka Sound in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The red-breasted sapsucker is now one of four species placed in the genus &quot;Sphyrapicus&quot; that was introduced in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird.

The red-breasted sapsucker, the red-naped sapsucker (&quot;Sphyrapicus nuchalis&quot;) and the yellow-bellied sapsucker (&quot;Sphyrapicus varius&quot;) were formerly treated as a single species, the yellow-bellied sapsucker. The red-breasted and red-naped sapsuckers interbreed where their ranges overlap. Sapsuckers are in the Picidae, or woodpecker, family, in the order Piciformes.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. r. ruber&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – south Alaska to west Oregon
* &quot;S. r. daggetti&quot; Grinnell, 1901 – southwest USA

==Description==
Adults have a red head and upper chest; they have a white lower belly and rump. They are black on the back and wings with bars; they have a large white wing patch. The northern birds, subspecies &quot;S. r. ruber&quot;, have yellow bars on the back and yellow upper belly. The southern birds, subspecies &quot;S. r. daggetti&quot;, have white bars on the back and a pale belly. The wing barring is white in both variants.

These birds make various noises; their vocalizations include a variety of chatter, squeals, and scream-like calls, and they also drum with their bills on various surfaces. Many of these noises serve to establish territory and attract a mate. This is in addition to the noise made by drilling holes for feeding and by excavating nest cavities.

==Distribution and habitat ==
Red-breasted sapsuckers breed from southeast Alaska and British Columbia south through the Pacific Coast Ranges of western Washington and Oregon and northern California.
The breeding habitat is usually forest that includes pine, hemlock, Douglas-fir, fir, and spruce, though they are known to use other woodland habitats. They prefer old-growth forest. They require living trees to provide the sap on which they feed.

===Migration===
The birds that breed in the northern part of the range migrate south in the winter, and individuals that breed in inland and upland locales often move to the coastal lowlands in winter, where the weather is milder. Winter habitat can be deciduous or coniferous woodland. This species’ winter range extends south to Baja California in Mexico.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Feeding===
A sapsucker&#x27;s tongue is adapted with stiff hairs for collecting sap. Red-breasted sapsuckers visit the same tree multiple times, drilling holes in neat horizontal rows. A bird will leave and come back later, when the sap has started flowing from the holes. Repeated visits over an extended period of time can actually kill the tree. The insects attracted to the sap are also consumed, and not only by sapsuckers. Rufous hummingbirds, for example, have been observed to follow the movements of sapsuckers and take advantage of this food source.

===Breeding===
Red-breasted sapsuckers nest in tree cavities. They begin work on creating a nest hole in a dead tree, usually a deciduous tree, in April or May, and produces one brood per breeding season. The female lays 4–7 pure white eggs. Both parents feed the young, and the fledglings leave the nest at 23–28 days old. The nest cavity is not reused.

<text>Rutland Water is a reservoir in Rutland, England, east of Rutland&#x27;s county town, Oakham. It is filled by pumping from the River Nene and River Welland, and provides water to the East Midlands. By surface area it is the largest reservoir in England, but its capacity is exceeded by that of Kielder Water in Northumberland. Its maximum depth is 33 m (108 ft).

Set in of countryside, it has a perimeter track, ( excluding Hambleton Peninsula) for walking or cycling. Since the water is drawn upon when needed, the relative areas of land and water vary a little, but the flatter parts of the lake margin are enclosed by banks so that the wetland nature reserve is maintained ().

A 1,555 hectare area of lake and shore is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, and a Nature Conservation Review site. An area of 1,333 hectares is an internationally important wetland site under the Ramsar Convention, and 393 hectares at the western end is managed by the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust.

==Construction==
The reservoir&#x27;s construction, by damming the Gwash valley near Empingham, was completed in 1975. During its construction it was known as Empingham Reservoir. It flooded six or seven square kilometres of the Gwash valley as well as the side valley, at the head of which lies Oakham. Nether Hambleton and most of Middle Hambleton were demolished and their wells were plugged as part of the ground preparation. Their neighbouring village of Upper Hambleton survived, and now sits on the Hambleton Peninsula. The Gwash makes a net input to the lake but its flow downstream is maintained. Most of the stored water is extracted from the River Welland at , between Tinwell and Stamford, and from the River Nene upstream from Peterborough, a city which is a major user of the water.

Because much of the valley is clay, material for the dam was extracted from pits dug within the area that would be subsequently flooded. The clay dam is high, and around long. At its base, it is up to wide, and the finished structure has been landscaped to blend in with the environment, even when viewed from Empingham, the nearest village.

Rutland Water contains a limnological tower for study of the reservoir&#x27;s ecological conditions.
==Community==
Upper Hambleton and the remnant of Middle Hambleton, including the Old Hall, are together now known simply as Hambleton and are to be found on a long peninsula in the middle of the lake, land that was formerly a ridge between the two valleys in which the lake now lies. The few houses of Normanton avoided flooding although its church did not. The lower part of the building was supported against water damage so that its upper part could be used to present the story of the construction of the reservoir to the public. Some funerary monuments from it can be seen at Edenham church, Lincolnshire.

==Recreation==
The reservoir is used not just for water storage, but is a popular sports centre – as well as water sports such as sailing, visitors enjoy fishing, walking and cycling along a perimeter track. A pleasure cruiser, the &quot;Rutland Belle&quot;, carries people around the lake. Birdwatching brings visitors from far afield.

==Wildlife==
Large areas of wetland (as well as several small woods) at the western end of the lake form a nature reserve, managed by Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. The area is designated a Special Protection Area of international importance for its wintering populations of gadwall (some 4% of this species’ European population) and shoveler. It is home to the Anglian Water Bird Watching Centre. Every August, the centre was the venue for the British Birdwatching Fair until 2019. Other birds found here include lapwing, coot, goldeneye, tufted duck, pochard, teal, wigeon, cormorant, great crested grebe, little grebe and, most notably, osprey, which were re-introduced to the area during 1996, including one called &quot;Mr Rutland&quot;. In 2021 there were 26 ospreys in the area of Rutland Water.

The lake is stocked with brown trout and rainbow trout, but there is a large head of coarse fish populated by water pumped in from the River Welland and River Nene, species include roach, bream, pike, zander, perch, eel, wels catfish and carp.

==Ichthyosaur==
In early 2021 an ichthyosaur fossil was discovered during the routine draining of a lagoon at the reservoir by nature reserve manager Joe Davis. A &quot;Temnodontosaurus&quot; with a skeleton measuring about 10 metres in length and a skull weighing about a tonne, is the largest and most complete fossil of its kind found in the UK.

==Visitor centres==
The Anglian Water Birdwatching Centre, located in Egleton, features a gift shop operated by Anglian Water and a shop selling binoculars and telescopes. The centre includes the Rutland Environmental Education Centre, exhibits, and windows overlooking the wetlands.

Rutland Water Visitor Centre, located at Sykes Lane, is a charming visitor information centre where there are a range of visitor leaflets &amp; maps, knowledgable staff, Rutland themed souvenirs &amp; mini golf.

The Lyndon Visitor Centre is located on the reserve&#x27;s south shore. There are exhibits, bird viewing windows, trails and hides.

<text>Élise Rivet, also known as Mère Marie Élisabeth de l&#x27;Eucharistie (January 19, 1890, Draria, Algeria – March 30, 1945, Ravensbrück concentration camp, Germany) was a Catholic nun and World War II heroine. Rivet volunteered to go to the gas chamber, in place of a mother, in the German concentration camp of Ravensbrück.
==Early life==
Rivet was born to an Alsatian mother and French naval officer father. After the death of her father in 1910, she moved with her mother to Lyon. She worked for a time in a hair salon before joining the convent of the medical sisters of &quot;Notre Dame de Compassion&quot; in Lyon in 1912. In 1933 she became Mère Marie Élisabeth de l&#x27;Eucharistie, the convent&#x27;s .

==World War II==
After the fall of the French Third Republic to Nazi Germany in World War II, she began hiding refugees from the Gestapo and eventually used her convent to store weapons and ammunition for the Mouvements Unis de la Résistance (MUR) at the request of Albert Chambonnet.

On March 24, 1944, she and her assistant were arrested by the Gestapo and taken to the Montluc prison in Lyon. From there, she was taken to Romainville, before being shipped to Ravensbrück concentration camp near Berlin, Germany. There, stripped of her religious garments, she was forced into hard labor. Rivet volunteered to go to the gas chamber on March 30, 1945, in place of a mother only weeks before Germany surrendered unconditionally. She was 55 years old.

==Legacy==
In 1961, the government of France honored her with her portrait on a Heroes of the Resistance postage stamp. A street bearing her name was inaugurated in Brignais (Lyon) on December 2, 1979. In 1996, she was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations. In 1997, she was posthumously awarded the Médaille des Justes. In 1999, a lecture hall at the Institut des Sciences de l&#x27;Homme in Lyon was named &quot;Salle Élise Rivet&quot; in her honor.

<text>Bridge of Allan (, ), also known colloquially as Bofa, is a former spa town in the Stirling council area in Scotland, just north of the city of Stirling. 

Overlooked by the National Wallace Monument, it lies on the Allan Water, a northern tributary of the River Forth, built largely on the well-wooded slopes of the Westerton and Airthrey estates, sheltered by the Ochil Hills from the north and east winds. Most of the town is to the east of the river; the bridge is part of the A9, Scotland&#x27;s longest road, while the railway line and the M9 pass to the west of the river. Bridge of Allan railway station is on the electrified Edinburgh to Dunblane Line and is accessible by train from Stirling in under 5 minutes as well as London in under six hours.

== History ==
During the Iron Age, the local people of the area were known as the Maeatae and it was they who constructed a powerful hillfort nearby. The early village consisted of seven small clachans: Bridge End, Kierfield, Old Lecropt, Pathfoot, Logie, Corntown and the Milne of Airthrey. The villages were very separate and the villagers lived in the small world of their own communities.

The site occupied by modern Bridge of Allan stretches from the clachan of Logie across the Allan Water to the University of Stirling. It was first mentioned in a charter granted by King David I. The charter was written in connection with a dispute between the nuns of North Berwick and the monks at Dunfermline Abbey over the tithes of Airthrey and Corntown. It is un-dated, but had been granted by 1146.

A hog&#x27;s back, narrow, stone bridge was built to replace the old ford across the River Allan in 1520. It rose sharply from the riverbank and dipped steeply at the other side. Soon after a few cottages began to appear around the ends of the bridge and an embryonic Bridge of Allan slowly formed. In the woods above the bridge, a mine opened. This was worked from around 1550, and quantities of copper, silver and gold were extracted.

By the middle of the seventeenth century, the Airthrey Estate had passed to relatives of the Marquess of Montrose, the Grahams. James Graham rose for the king during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and in 1645 as the army of the Duke of Argyll passed through the Airthrey estate on its way to the battle of Kilsyth they burned down the manor house.

The Jacobites were in Bridge of Allan in 1745, where three hundred highlanders set up a roadblock on the bridge and charged a toll for its passage. One of the old toll posts is still on display on a path leading up from Henderson Street.

In the early 19th century the town was little developed and typified by small, straw-roofed cottages. 

Major Alexander Henderson, the Laird of Westerton, drew up plans of how he wanted the village to be laid out in 1850, envisaging spacious streets with pleasure grounds in the woods. He also erected a fountain in Market Street. It was at this time that many handsome stone villas were built on wide thoroughfares, with practically every second house becoming a lodging house as Bridge of Allan became a renowned spa town, especially during the boom years of hydropathic establishments. Among the visitors was Robert Louis Stevenson who visited annually during his youth.

In 1870, Bridge of Allan became an independent Police Burgh with its own Provost. In the same year Laurence and Edmund Pullar moved to Bridge of Allan to open the huge Keirfield Works on the south-west of the town. This huge factory served as a major satellite for his father, John Pullar&#x27;s firm of J. Pullar &amp; Son later known as &quot;Pullars of Perth&quot;. The Bridge of Allan plant serviced all of central and southern Scotland, whilst Perth served the north. The Pullars also built extensive housing schemes from the 1880s onwards to house the growing workforce. The Pullars also bought Westerton House from Major Henderson to use as their home.

The Museum Hall was built by the trustees of John Macfarlane of Coneyhill in 1887, originally as the Macfarlane Museum and Art Gallery. In its use as a concert venue it once played host to the Beatles in 1963 but was subsequently allowed to fall into disuse and considerable disrepair. It has now been redeveloped for residential use.

By 1900, the town had four churches: the parish church still linked to the Church of Scotland; two United Free Churches, Chalmers Church and Trinity Church; and St Saviour&#x27;s, Scottish Episcopal Church. The town is currently served by Bridge of Allan Parish Church, Church of Scotland, and St Saviour&#x27;s Scottish Episcopal Church.

Pullar Memorial Park was created in 1923 to house the Bridge of Allan War Memorial to those lost in the First World War. It was erected by the industrialist Edmund Pullar son of John Pullar, creators of Pullars of Perth.

Bridge of Allan was formerly administered by firstly Stirlingshire County Council and then Central Regional Council.

== Churches ==
There are two churches in the village, built opposite each other at the junction of Keir Street and Fountain Road. These are St Saviour&#x27;s Episcopal church built in 1857, and the Church of Scotland&#x27;s Bridge of Allan Parish Church, notable for some of its internal fittings being designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in 1904. In 2004, there were two Church of Scotland congregations; Chalmers Church on Henderson Street, which has since been turned into flats, and Holy Trinity, on Keir Street. These churches united to form Bridge of Allan Parish Church, in what was the Holy Trinity building on Keir Street. 

The current minister of Bridge of Allan Parish Church is Rev&#x27;d Dan Harper, who was ordained and inducted to the charge in January 2016. He also serves as chaplain to both Bridge of Allan Primary, and Wallace High School. 

Outside Bridge of Allan, on the A9 road to Dunblane, is Lecropt Kirk (also Church of Scotland). Historically, this church served the entirely rural parish of Lecropt, west of Bridge of Allan.

Bridge of Allan has an increasingly active community with a number of residents giving their time for various volunteer groups. In 2022, The Friends of Bridge of Allan were awarded The Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service for service to the community and Discover Bridge of Allan was established as a community development trust with a focus on community wealth building, sustainability and inclusivity. 

== Film and television ==

<doc id="354507" wikidata="Q119294" url="?curid=354507" title="Tonga Trench">
<text>The Tonga Trench is an oceanic trench located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It is the deepest trench in the Southern hemisphere and the second deepest on Earth after the Mariana Trench. The fastest plate-tectonic velocity on Earth is occurring at this location, as the Pacific plate is being subducted westward in the trench.

==Horizon Deep==

The deepest point of the Tonga Trench, the Horizon Deep at , is deep, making it the deepest point in the Southern Hemisphere and the second deepest on Earth after the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. It is named for the research vessel &quot;Horizon&quot; of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the crew of which found the deep in December 1952.

As one of the deepest hadal trenches, the sediment of the Horizon Deep harbours a community of roundworms. A 2016 study found that the abundance of individuals in this community is six times greater than it is at a site on the trench edge at approximately near the deep and that the difference in biomass between these locations is even bigger. Species diversity, on the other hand, is twice as big on the trench slope, probably because of a small number of opportunistic species in the trench. Figures for abundance and biomass are similar for the deeps of the Mariana Trench but considerably lower in the Peru–Chile Trench.

=== Crewed descent ===
The Tonga Trench and the operating area was surveyed by the support ship, the Deep Submersible Support Vessel DSSV &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, with a Kongsberg SIMRAD EM124 multibeam echosounder system. The gathered data will be donated to the GEBCO Seabed 2030 initiative. The dive was part of the Five Deeps Expedition. The objective of this expedition is to thoroughly map and visit the deepest points of all five of the world&#x27;s oceans by the end of September 2019.

As part of the Five Deeps expedition, Sirena Deep, itself away from Horizon Deep, was visited by Victor Vescovo on the first crewed descent to the bottom of the Sirena Deep on 5 June 2019 (in the Deep-Submergence Vehicle , a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) and measured a depth of ± by direct CTD pressure measurements. This descent and direct depth measurement of Sirena Deep occurred a month after descending four times to the bottom of the Challenger Deep, which is also approximately 6,000 km away from the Tonga Trench.

== Geology ==
=== Tonga-Kermadec arc system ===
The region between the Tonga trench and the Lau back-arc basin, the Tonga-Kermadec Ridge, moves independently from the Australian and Pacific plates and is subdivided into several small plates, the Tonga, Kermadec, and Niuafo&#x27;ou plates. The Tonga plate is facing the Tonga Trench.

The Tonga Trench-Arc system is an extension-dominated, non-accretionary convergent margin. The Pacific plate is being subducted westward in the trench. The convergence rate has been estimated to but GPS measurements in the northern trench indicate a convergence rate of there. This is the fastest plate velocity on Earth, a result is the earth&#x27;s most active zone of mantle seismicity. Subduction rates decrease southward along the Tonga-Kermadec Arc, from in the north to in the south and also become more oblique southward. The high rate in the Tonga Trench is largely due to a reduction in extension in the Lau Basin. Crustal extension in the Miocene Lau-Colville Ridge began at 6 Ma which initiated the opening of the Lau Basin-Havre Trough. This extension has propagated southward since and has developed into a spreading centre in the Lau Basin in front of the Tonga Trench. New crust is thus produced in front of the Tonga-Kermadec trenches while old crust is consumed behind it in the Tonga Trench.

==== Pacific slab avalanche ====
While most of the large earthquakes occur at the contact zone between both tectonic plates, related to the friction during subduction, others are produced in the Pacific plate due to its bending. The Pacific crust that descends into the trench is old, 100–140 Ma, and relatively cold and it can therefore store a lot of elastic energy. As it reaches deep into the mantle, more than , and encounters barriers, it is being contorted, which produces deep mantle earthquakes.

About beneath the North Fiji Basin, a detached segment of the subducted Australian plate has collided with the subducted Pacific plate which produces many large-scale earthquakes. The subducted Pacific plate is also being deformed in the collision as both slabs settle on the 660 km discontinuity. This slab collision probably occurred 5–4 Ma when the Lau Basin started to open.

Oceanic trenches are important sites for the formation of what will become continental crust and for recycling of material back into the mantle. Along the Tonga Trench mantle-derived melts are transferred to the island arc systems, and abyssal oceanic sediments and fragments of oceanic crust are collected.

=== Tonga Trench–Lau Basin transition ===

The northern end of the Tonga Trench (at 15°10&#x27;S) is probably linked to the Fiji fracture zone, trending east–west north of Fiji, but the trench ends in a complex transition from subduction to a strike-slip motion and seismicity patterns indicate a presence of a transition zone rather than a simple transform fault. In or near this zone there is a ridge-ridge-ridge triple junction (), known as the King&#x27;s or Mangatolu triple junction (MTJ), characterised by deformation and recent and intense volcanism (see for example Home Reef). The Tofua volcanic arc on the northern Tonga Ridge extends to less than of the trench&#x27;s northern end.

Just north of the MTJ lies the south–north-trending Northeast Lau Spreading Centre (NELSC) which intercepts the northern end of the Tonga Trench and is one of three major spreading centres in the northern Lau Basin (together with the Futuna Spreading Centre and Northwest Lau Spreading Centre). The maximum spreading rate in the NELSC is but spreading decreases to zero at either end of the spreading centre. The total spreading rate between the Tongan and Australian plates, however, is , and additional microplates and/or deformations zones must thus exist. The NELSC probably receives magmatic contributions from the Samoa hotspot. The NELSC has a morphology which is similar to those of slow-spreading ridges with many closely packed ridges and troughs reaches. Where it meets the trench, a ridge-transform-transform boundary is developing between the Tonga Ridge, the Pacific plate, and the Australian plate.

North-east of the 60° bend in the Tonga Trench the Pacific seafloor is full of parallel lineations. These have been interpreted as remnants of an extinct, east-to-west-trending spreading centre on the Pacific plate, much older than the Tonga Trench.

=== Louisville Seamount Chain collision ===
At its southern end () the Tonga Trench is colliding with the Louisville Seamount Chain, a chain of guyots and seamounts on the Pacific plate roughly parallel to the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain in the northern pacific. The Louisville collision zone migrates southward at a rate of because of the difference in the oblique angle between the Louisville Ridge relative the direction of convergence. In the eastern Lau Basin spreading centres are propagating southward at roughly the same rate. The collision zone also offsets the Tonga Trench to the north-west relative to the Kermadec Trench by .
The subducting Louisville Ridge has caused a significant amount of erosion on the outer edge of the southern Tonga fore-arc and has probably accelerated subsidence in the Tonga Trench, a process which makes the Tonga Trench the second deepest trench on Earth and considerably deeper than the Kermadec Trench.

The oldest and westernmost of the Louisville seamounts, the Osbourn Seamount, is sitting on the edge of the trench and its former flat top is currently tilting towards the trench. West of the Osbourn Seamount a broad zone of faulted blocks shallows the trench by while the adjacent fore-arc is elevated by and covered by canyons.

The Louisville collision zone correlates with a zone of seismic quiescence along the Tonga-Kermadec Trench known as the &quot;Louisville Gap&quot;. This gap in seismicity indicates that subducting seamounts inhibit or even prevent seismicity at subduction zones, perhaps by increasing intervals between earthquakes, but the mechanism behind this process is poorly understood.

Geochemical evidence suggests that the Louisville chain has been subducting under the Tonga-Kermadec Arc since 4 Ma. Seismic studies have identified a southward, along-arc mantle flow that indicate that Pacific mantle is being replaced by Indo-Australian mantle west of the Tonga Trench.

=== Osbourn Trough ===
The Osbourn Trough, located at 25.5°S just north of the Louisville Ridge collision zone, is a -long extinct spreading ridge midway between two large oceanic plateaux north and south of the Tonga Trench respectively: Manihiki to the north and Hikurangi to the south. These plateaux once formed part of the Ontong Java-Manihiki-Hikurangi large igneous province (LIP). Spreading between the plateaux ceased when Hikurangi collided with the Chatham Rise east of New Zealand which had been estimated to have been at 86 Ma, although may be as recent as 79 Ma. The western end of the Osbourn Trough is bounded by the Tonga Trench and its eastern by the Wishbone–East Manihiki scarp. In between the Osbourn Trough is divided into three segments separated by dextral offsets. Near the Tonga Trench the bathymetry of these structures is affected by the rotation of the Pacific plate.

=== Capricorn Seamount ===

The Capricorn Seamount is a guyot located on the eastern wall of the northern Tonga Trench (see map above). It is a large guyot, wide at its base with a small part of its reefal or lagoonal summit reaching below sea level. The bending of the Pacific plate at the Tonga Trench is currently slicing it like a loaf of bread: inside the guyot a north–south-trending horst and graben system is developing parallel to the trench; the western slope of the guyot has reached the trench and has started to fill it; the summit of the guyot is tilted 1.7° towards the trench and its centre is only from the trench axis. The Capricorn Seamount is expected to be completely consumed by the trench within 500,000 years.

== Apollo 13 ==

When the Apollo 13 mission was aborted in 1970 following an explosion in an oxygen tank, it had to bring the entire Lunar Module back to Earth. As the LEM was jettisoned prior to reentry, its radioisotope thermoelectric generator broke up in the atmosphere, and the heat source plunged into an area of the Pacific Ocean that is either in or near the Tonga Trench. However, due to protective casing, no release of 238Pu (half-life of 87.7 years) used as heat source in the thermoelectric generator could be detected by atmospheric and oceanic monitoring.

<text>Nezahualpilli (Nahuatl for &quot;fasting prince&quot;; 1464–1515, ) was king (&quot;tlatoani&quot;) of the Mesoamerican city-state of Texcoco, elected by the city&#x27;s nobility after the death of his father, Nezahualcoyotl, in 1472. Nezahuapilli&#x27;s mother was Azcalxochitzin, who married Nezahualcoyotl after the death of her first husband, King Cuahcuauhtzin of Tepechpan.

Like his father, he was a poet, was considered a sage, and had the reputation of being a fair ruler. Only one of his poems survives: &quot;Icuic Nezahualpilli yc tlamato huexotzinco&quot; (&quot;Song of Nezahualpilli during the war with Huexotzinco&quot;). His court was a haven for astronomers, engineers, and soothsayers. During his reign, he abolished capital punishment for a number of crimes and struggled to keep the political independence of Texcoco during the increasing centralization of Aztec power in Tenochtitlán.

When he told Moctezuma II that the Texcocan wise men had foretold foreign dominion over the Valley of Mexico, the emperor challenged him to a ball game. Moctezuma considered the loss of the game a negative omen.

Nezahualpilli was said to have taken numerous consorts and fathered 144 children. He was succeeded by his son Cacama.

<text>Quintus Baebius Tamphilus (&quot;&quot; late-3rd century BC) was a praetor of the Roman Republic who participated in negotiations with Hannibal attempting to forestall the Second Punic War.

Little is known of Baebius&#x27;s life and political career, but it is likely that he held the praetorship before 218 BC. When Hannibal besieged Saguntum (now Sagunto), an ally of Rome, the Saguntines petitioned for assistance, and in response the Senate sent Baebius and Publius Valerius Flaccus as envoys to Spain, with instructions to demand that Hannibal leave Saguntum alone. They were then to proceed to Carthage to ask for his surrender as punishment for breaking the treaty that had been concluded at the end of the First Punic War. Turned back in Spain, the delegation got a hearing in the Carthaginian senate, but the Carthaginians supported Hannibal.

T.R.S. Broughton points out that the dating of the embassy is vexed. The Augustan-era historian Livy (21.6.3) seems to indicate that Valerius and Baebius were dispatched by the consuls of 218. Saguntum fell before the winter of 219–218, and since the envoys were supposed to have arrived before Hannibal&#x27;s attack, the latest possible date is early 219. Dating based on Polybius points to a different story. &quot;Probably deliberately,&quot; notes Dexter Hoyos, &quot;Roman historical tradition afterwards distorted the facts about this embassy. … This story gathered increasingly implausible features as it went on.&quot;

In 218, Baebius was part of a delegation sent to Carthage with an ultimatum in expectation of declaring war. Livy notes that the five diplomatic legates were elder statesmen; they were all of consular rank except for the praetorian Baebius. The ambassadors then visited Spain and Gaul to recruit allies, with mixed results. Rome&#x27;s failure to act more speedily on the diplomatic front allowed the war to expand into Gaul and Italy from Spain.

Quintus Baebius&#x27;s sons Gnaeus and Marcus were consuls in an unusual instance of brothers holding the office successively (in 182 and 181 BC). The eldest son was probably the plebeian tribune Quintus Baebius who opposed going to war with Philip V of Macedon in 200 BC.

<doc id="354514" wikidata="Q2574259" url="?curid=354514" title="Cacamatzin">
<text>Cacamatzin (or Cacama) (c. 1483–1520) was the tlatoani (ruler) of Texcoco, the second most important city of the Aztec Empire.

Cacamatzin was a son of the previous king Nezahualpilli by one of his mistresses. Traditionally, the Texcocan kings were elected by the nobility from the most able of the royal family. Cacamatzin&#x27;s election to the throne in 1515 was said to have been made under considerable pressure from Moctezuma II, lord of Tenochtitlán. Moctezuma II wished to lessen Texcoco&#x27;s power in favor of greater centralization in Tenochtitlán.

Cacamatzin wrote &quot;Cacamatzin Icuic&quot; (&quot;Song of Cacamatzin&quot;), invoking his father and grandfather; he seems to protest against Pedro de Alvarado&#x27;s attack during the festival of Tóxcatl.

Moctezuma II, under orders from Cortés, had Cacamatzin arrested &quot;in his own palace while discussing war-preparations&quot;. The &quot;Caciques&quot; of Coyoacan, Iztapalapa, and Tacuba were also arrested.

Cacamatzin died during the retreat of Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, on La Noche Triste.

==Rebellion==
While staying in the Axayácatl palace, the Spaniards discovered the room where the treasures of Moctezuma&#x27;s grandfather were found. Cortés asked the huey tlatoani about the places where the gold came from. After the answer, expeditions were organized to the regions of Zacatula, Pánuco and Coatzacoalcos; Cortés also demanded that Moctezuma ask all his vassals to immediately pay all available gold. Tetlahuehuezquititzin and Netzahualquentzin, both Cacamatzin&#x27;s brothers, were responsible in Tetzcuco for delivering the gold to the Spanish. Due to a misunderstanding, a probable treason on the part of Netzahualquentzin was suspected, he was arrested and taken in front of Cortés who sentenced him to hang, but Moctezuma interceded and the sentence was suspended, however Netzahualquentzin had been flogged.

Exacerbated by events, Cacamatzin summoned his vassals, his cousin and lord of Coyoacán, as well as the tlatoani of Tlacopan Totoquihuatzin, the lord of Iztapalapa Cuitláhuac, and the lord of Matlatzinco, to rebel against the Spanish conquerors. However, Moctezuma, enraptured by the Europeans, and not wanting to see Tenochtitlan under war, alerted Cortés, who tried to make peace with the Lord of Tetzcuco. Cacamatzin&#x27;s answer was negative, he even argued that he did not believe his lies and that he would not be convinced as the huey tlatoani had been.

Moctezuma, through messengers, interceded in favor of Cortés and ordered Cacamatzin to be asked once again not to attempt rebellion against the Spanish. In response, the Lord of Tetzcuco gave an ultimatum of four days, adding that his uncle was a chicken, he begged Moctezuma to let go, to be a lord and not a slave, he told Cortés that he had no friendship with whoever took him away. honor and kingdom, and that the war he wanted to wage was for the benefit of his vassals in defense of their land and religion.

<text>Walter Menzies Campbell, Baron Campbell of Pittenweem, (; born 22 May 1941), often known as Ming Campbell, is a Scottish politician, advocate and former athlete. A member of the Liberal Democrats, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for North East Fife from 1987 to 2015 and served as Leader of the Liberal Democrats from 2006 to 2007.

Campbell held the British record for the 100-metre sprint from 1967 to 1974, having run the distance in 10.2 seconds. He captained the Great Britain athletics team in 1965–66. He has been Chancellor of the University of St Andrews since 2006 and a member of the House of Lords as a life peer since 2015.

==Education and early career==
Born in Glasgow, Campbell was educated at Hillhead High School and the University of Glasgow, graduating with a Scottish Master of Arts (MA) in 1962 and a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) in 1965. He was elected President of the Glasgow University Liberal Club in 1962, and of the Glasgow University Union for 1964–65.

==Athletics career==




He was a sprinter at university and he broke Olympic gold medalist Wyndham Halswelle&#x27;s 53-year-old Scottish 300 yards record in 1961. Campbell competed for the Great Britain team in the 200 metres and 4×100 metres relay at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, and captained the Scotland team at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. He also captained the Great Britain athletics team in 1965 and 1966, and held the British 100 metres record from 1967 to 1974. At one time he was known as &quot;the fastest white man on the planet&quot;, running the 100m in 10.2 seconds twice during 1967. In his first 10.2-second race he beat O. J. Simpson, who was then an aspiring athlete.

==Member of Parliament==
===Liberal Democrats frontbenches===
As foreign affairs spokesperson, Campbell was prominent in the Liberal Democrat opposition to the 2003 Iraq War, arguing that the British government should publish the Attorney General&#x27;s secret advice on the war&#x27;s legality and criticising Tony Blair&#x27;s support for President George W. Bush. In 2004, Campbell set out his view of the Anglo-American relationship in the context of an unjust war: &quot;For more than 60 years we have been engaged in an intimate and rewarding relationship with the United States. We must not allow our foreign policy to be defined by that relationship. We have to recognize that the World&#x27;s most powerful English-speaking nation will always be a powerful influence upon us. Given what we share, it could hardly be otherwise. But a relationship with the United States based on the flawed principle, &quot;my ally right or wrong&quot; is not only profoundly illiberal but will be unsustainable as well.&quot;

===Leader of the Liberal Democrats===
On 7 January 2006, Campbell became interim leader following Kennedy&#x27;s resignation, before winning the subsequent leadership contest. On 2 March 2006, Campbell was declared leader after winning the leadership election under the alternative vote method. The first-round votes placed him in the lead, at 23,264 to Huhne&#x27;s 16,691 and Simon Hughes&#x27;s 12,081. Hughes was accordingly eliminated, and his second-preference votes were split between the two remaining candidates. The final result was Campbell at 29,697 and Chris Huhne at 21,628 on a 72% membership turnout.

Campbell promoted many younger MPs to his frontbench team including former MEP Nick Clegg as Home Affairs spokesperson and 26-year-old Jo Swinson as Scotland spokesperson.

====Questions over leadership====
Campbell&#x27;s early performances at the weekly Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions were criticised, leading him to declare himself &quot;perfectly confident&quot; that he could fulfil the role of party leader. Campbell regained some ground with the controversy over the US practice of &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot;, the case of the NatWest Three, and the conflict in Lebanon.

According to polls published in July 2006, twice as many voters preferred Charles Kennedy as leader over Campbell, which led to further criticism of Campbell&#x27;s leadership. However, Kennedy called rumours that he was considering challenging for the leadership as &quot;fanciful&quot;.

The University of St Andrews awarded an honorary doctorate of law to former President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, which sparked some criticism, although as Chancellor he is only the titular head and not involved in such decisions. Khatami was elected as President of Iran in 1997 and 2001, both occasions on platforms of social and political reform and a &quot;Dialogue Among Civilizations&quot; that put Khatami significantly at odds with his conservative successor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Shortly before Gordon Brown took over as prime minister in June 2007, Campbell was invited to a meeting with the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Brown surprised Campbell by requesting that two Liberal Democrats (Lord Ashdown and Lady Neuberger) join his cabinet. After taking 24 hours to consult and consider, Campbell rejected the offer as unworkable, given the gulf between the parties on issues of foreign policy and civil liberties. Labour leaked news of the meeting to the media and went behind Campbell to offer the job of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to Ashdown anyway; he turned it down.

After intense speculation in late 2007, Gordon Brown announced there would be no general election in 2007. Following this announcement, Campbell&#x27;s leadership again came under question, with some in the party feeling that now the heat was off the time was ripe to get a younger leader potentially more capable of connecting with voters. On 15 October, Campbell&#x27;s deputy Vince Cable conceded on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The World at One&quot; programme that Campbell&#x27;s position was &quot;certainly under discussion&quot;, adding &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s under threat&quot;, but on the same programme party stalwart Sir Chris Clarke advised Campbell to &quot;go with dignity and go back to being foreign affairs spokesman, where the world listens to you.&quot; Later the same day came an announcement by the party that Campbell would step down as leader.
====Resignation of leadership====
Campbell resigned as leader of the Liberal Democrats on 15 October 2007. The announcement was made from the steps of Cowley Street by Party President Simon Hughes. Alongside him was deputy Leader Vince Cable; they praised Campbell&#x27;s leadership and said the party owed him a debt of gratitude. In his letter of resignation, addressed to Hughes, Campbell stated, &quot;It has become clear that following the Prime Minister&#x27;s decision not to hold an election, questions about leadership are getting in the way of further progress by the party&quot;.

Cable became acting leader of the Liberal Democrats until a leadership election could be held. Campbell became the first elected leader of the Liberal Democrats who left the leadership without ever leading the party to a general election. Following the resignation, a leadership contender, Nick Clegg, alleged that Campbell had been a victim of ageism throughout his term as party leader, saying he had been treated &quot;appallingly&quot; and subject to &quot;barely disguised ageism&quot;.

Concerns about ageism directed at Campbell from the media had also been raised by the charity Age Concern in September 2006. Gordon Lishman, the director of the charity, said &quot;the recent media coverage poking fun at Sir Menzies has brought to light the age discrimination that is epidemic in the media and society&quot;. Attacking media coverage that seemed to focus on his age, Lishman added &quot;clearly the media needs to update its attitudes and get with the times; people are living and working longer and age discrimination is out dated&quot;.

===Expenses claims===
Sir Menzies Campbell reportedly claimed around £10,000 over two years to redesign his flat in London, which included the purchasing of a king-sized bed, scatter cushions and a small flat screen television. It was also claimed that on occasions Campbell spent eight hundred pounds a month on food. Campbell said he believed that the claims were &quot;within the spirit and letter of the rules&quot; as the flat had not been renovated for 20 years.

===Retirement from the House of Commons===
On 9 October 2013, Campbell announced that he would stand down as a Member of Parliament at the 2015 general election. He said: &quot;It is always a regret to begin the process of retiring from the House of Commons but I believe now is the time to start&quot;. Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg paid tribute, saying Campbell &quot;served this country and our party with unparalleled distinction&quot;.

There was speculation in 2013 that he would be offered a seat in the House of Lords – an opportunity in which, during an interview with Chat Politics, Campbell declared his interest. He became a life peer and a member of the House of Lords in October 2015. Campbell has stated that he believes the House of Lords should be &quot;mainly elected&quot; and will continue to promote that idea &quot;within the house itself.&quot;

==Political views==
Campbell promoted policies to shift taxation away from &quot;goods&quot; such as employment and towards &quot;bads&quot; such as pollution through a revenue-neutral restructuring of the tax system that maintains the current tax burden whilst lifting two-million low-paid individuals out of income tax altogether.

Campbell&#x27;s primary area of interest is acknowledged to be foreign policy. He strongly supports multilateral institutions such as the European Union and the United Nations but argues that the European Union must reform to become more democratic and the United Nations must develop new mechanisms for dealing with humanitarian crises.

He has been critical of what he claims as the &quot;disproportionate military action&quot; employed by the Israeli Defence Force in Gaza and in Lebanon, contending that Israel&#x27;s tactics exacerbate existing tensions and lead to human rights abuses. Though a supporter of Anglo-American cooperation, Campbell has argued that the Bush-Blair relationship was one-sided and that the Labour government pursued it at the expense of Britain&#x27;s standing in other international institutions, particularly the EU and UN.

Campbell had stressed the need for the Liberal Democrats to provide extra support for female, disabled and ethnic minority candidates seeking to contest winnable seats.

In July 2007, Campbell unveiled tax proposals that amounted to a large shift in the tax burden away from low-income and middle-income earners and onto higher-earners and pollution. This was to be implemented by cutting the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 16%, closing £13.5 billion of tax loopholes for high-earners and imposing larger green taxes on polluters. Campbell said of the proposals that &quot;the unacceptable reality is that in Britain today the poorest pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than the super-rich&quot; and that his aim was for &quot;the rich and people with environmentally damaging lifestyles to pay a fairer share&quot;.

Campbell is a member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009.

In August 2018, Campbell spoke at a People&#x27;s Vote rally in Edinburgh. People&#x27;s Vote was a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union.

== Personal life ==
Campbell married Elspeth, Lady Grant-Suttie, daughter of Major General Roy Urquhart and former wife of Sir Philip Grant-Suttie, 8th Baronet, in June 1970. The couple had no children, but Lady Campbell had a son from her first marriage. Lady Campbell died on 5 June 2023, aged 83.

==Honours==
Campbell was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1987 New Year Honours; he became a Privy Counsellor in the 1999 New Year Honours; and he was knighted in the 2004 New Year Honours for services to Parliament, having the honour conferred by the Prince of Wales on 27 May 2004.

He was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for public and political service. He was nominated for a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours and created Baron Campbell of Pittenweem, of Pittenweem in the County of Fife, on 13 October 2015.

Campbell has honorary degrees from the University of Glasgow and the University of Strathclyde. He was the only person nominated to succeed Sir Kenneth Dover after he retired as Chancellor of the University of St Andrews on 1 January 2006, so took office immediately after nominations closed on 9 January 2006. He was installed as Chancellor on 22 April 2006, at which time he also received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.

In 2010 it was reported that Campbell had been considered for the post of High Commissioner to Australia; &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed it had been stalled as it would trigger a by-election in Campbell&#x27;s constituency.

<doc id="354524" wikidata="Q987075" url="?curid=354524" title="Post-1992 university">
<text>In the United Kingdom (UK), a post-1992 university, synonymous with new university or modern university, is a former polytechnic or central institution that was given university status through the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, or an institution that has been granted university status since 1992 without receiving a royal charter. This is used in contrast to &quot;pre-1992&quot; universities.

The term &quot;new universities&quot; was historically used to refer to universities that were at the time new. In the mid-19th century, it was used in England to distinguish the recently established universities of Durham and London from the &quot;old universities&quot; of Oxford and Cambridge. In the early 20th century, the term was applied to the civic universities that had recently gained university status, such as Bristol and others (now known as red brick universities). The term was later used to refer to universities gaining their status in the 1960s, such as the former colleges of advanced technology, which were converted to universities following the 1963 Robbins Report on higher education, and the plate glass universities, which were already in the process of being established at the time of the report.

== Formation ==

Following the 1992 Act, 33 polytechnics in England, the Derbyshire College of Higher Education, the Polytechnic of Wales and three Scottish central institutions were the first to be granted university status, alongside another trio of central institutions in the years following.
Many of these Polytechnics had roots in the middle 19th Century.
All the categories of university award their own academic degrees, but universities created in England and Wales since 2004 may only have the power to award taught degrees, because the power to award research degrees has been removed from the criteria for university title. The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education, which became the University of Gloucestershire in 2001, was the only institute to become a university in England between the polytechnics in 1992 and the relaxation of the criteria in 2004. Two new universities have subsequently been established in Scotland, where the old criteria still apply: Queen Margaret University (2007), another former central institution, and the University of the Highlands and Islands (2011).

These may not meet a strict definition of new universities as being universities under the 1992 act, but have elements of common heritage with new universities.

* University of Wales Trinity Saint David – formed by the merger of University of Wales, Lampeter, Trinity University College, Carmarthen and Swansea Metropolitan University (formerly West Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education). University by royal charter rather than under the 1992 act.

==Secondary issues==
Most former polytechnics welcomed the new nomenclature of &quot;university&quot; as evidence of the abolition of the hierarchical binary system of universities and polytechnics. The new title also assisted recruitment of foreign students (a lucrative market sector which was not always sure what a &quot;polytechnic&quot; was). However, since most former polytechnics were established from locally funded technical colleges, polytechnics were, like their predecessors, controlled by and answerable to local government. The adoption of university status severed that link with the community, creating universities as semi-autonomous bodies answerable only to central government. As a result of their roots under local government, most employees of those polytechnic post-1992 universities are members of the Teachers&#x27; Pension Scheme, rather than the Universities Superannuation Scheme.

<doc id="354525" wikidata="Q175759" url="?curid=354525" title="Patti Page">
<text>Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 – January 1, 2013), better known by her stage name Patti Page, was an American singer. Primarily known for pop and country music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career. She was often introduced as &quot;the Singin&#x27; Rage, Miss Patti Page&quot;. New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as &quot;A Page in my life called Patti&quot;.

Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948&#x27;s &quot;Confess&quot;. In 1950, she had her first million-selling single &quot;With My Eyes Wide Open, I&#x27;m Dreaming&quot;, and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.

Page&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;, was one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee. It spent 13 weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s best-sellers list in 1950/51. Page had three additional number-one hit singles between 1950 and 1953, &quot;All My Love (Bolero)&quot;, &quot;I Went to Your Wedding&quot;, and &quot;(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?&quot;.

Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page&#x27;s singles appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.

With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with &quot;Old Cape Cod&quot;, &quot;Allegheny Moon&quot;, &quot;A Poor Man&#x27;s Roses (or a Rich Man&#x27;s Gold)&quot;, and &quot;Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;.

In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013.

==Early life==
Clara Ann Fowler was born on November 8, 1927, in Claremore, Oklahoma (some sources give Muskogee, Oklahoma) into a large and poor family of 11 children (3 boys and 8 girls). Her father, B.A. Fowler, worked on the MKT railroad, while her mother, Margaret, and older sisters picked cotton. As she recalled on television many years later, the family lived without electricity, so she could not read after dark. She was raised in Foraker, Hardy, Muskogee, and Avant, Oklahoma, before attending Daniel Webster High School in Tulsa, from which she graduated in 1945.

Fowler started her career as a singer with Al Clauser and his Oklahoma Outlaws at radio station KTUL in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At age 18, she became a featured performer on the station for a 15-minute radio program sponsored by the Page Milk Company. As a nod to the show&#x27;s sponsor, Fowler was referred to on the air as &quot;Patti Page&quot;. In 1946, Jack Rael, a saxophone player and manager of the Jimmy Joy Band, came to Tulsa for a one-night stand. Rael heard Page on the radio, liked her voice, and asked her to join the band. After leaving the band, Rael became Page&#x27;s personal manager.

Page toured the United States with the Jimmy Joy Band in 1946. The following year the band traveled to Chicago, where she sang with a small group led by popular orchestra leader Benny Goodman. This led to Page getting picked up by Mercury Records. She became Mercury&#x27;s &quot;girl singer&quot;.

==Career==
===Pop success: 1946–1949===
Page cut her first two discs (&quot;Every So Often/What Every Woman Knows&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s A Man In My Life/The First Time I Kissed You&quot;) with the Eddie Getz and George Barnes Orchestras but they failed to chart.

She found success with her third single (&quot;Confess&quot; b/w &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock Flight&quot;). The arrangement of &quot;Confess&quot; was meant to use a backing chorus, but Mercury would not pay for one since Page had not yet produced a charting single, so if she wanted additional singers she would have to hire them at her own expense. Instead, her manager Jack Rael decided to try an experiment. Bill Putnam, an engineer for Mercury Records, was able to overdub Page&#x27;s voice by syncing the two master discs together—tape recording was not in use yet and this technique was difficult to pull off. Thus, Page became the first pop artist to harmonize her own vocals on a recording. This gimmick got &quot;Confess&quot; to #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;. This technique later was used on Page&#x27;s biggest hit singles in the 1950s. Page had four more singles chart in 1948–49, with two (&quot;So In Love&quot; and &quot;With My Eyes Wide Open, I&#x27;m Dreaming&quot; reaching the top 15. Page also had a top 15 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart in 1949 with &quot;Money, Marbles, and Chalk&quot;. After the experiment of &quot;Confess&quot; worked, Page and Rael got more ambitious and began trying four part overdubs.

In 1950, Page had her first million-selling single &quot;With My Eyes Wide Open, I&#x27;m Dreaming&quot;, another song where she harmonized her vocals. Because she was overdubbing her vocals, Page&#x27;s name had to be listed on the recording credits as a group. According to one early 1950s chart, Page was credited as the Patti Page Quartet. In mid-1950, Page&#x27;s single &quot;All My Love (Bolero)&quot; became her first #1 on the Billboard spending five weeks there. That same year, she also had her first top-10 hit with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care if the Sun Don&#x27;t Shine&quot;, as well as the top-25 single &quot;Back in Your Own Backyard&quot;. With this success, Page earned the privilege of releasing her first LP, the self-titled &quot;Patti Page&quot; which opened with &quot;Confess&quot; and included other of her singles from this period. She also released a Christmas album in 1951; this was reissued five years later with updated cover art on a 12&quot; LP with a few new tracks to fill the run time out.

===&quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;: 1950===
The success of &quot;Bolero&quot; however was quickly eclipsed by what soon became Page&#x27;s signature song. &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; was written in 1946 by Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart, and was recorded in 1947 by Pee Wee King and His Golden West Cowboys. Their original version made the country charts in 1948. The song was also a hit for Cowboy Copas around the same time. Page was introduced to the song by record producer Jerry Wexler, who suggested that she cover a recent R&amp;B version by the Erskine Hawkins Orchestra. Page liked the song, and she recorded and released it as a single.

&quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; became a blockbuster hit by complete accident—it was the B-side to &quot;Boogie Woogie Santa Claus&quot; which Mercury had intended to promote during the 1950 holiday season. The label intentionally put &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; on the disc to avoid drawing attention away from a planned Christmas hit, as they considered the song a throwaway with no hitmaking potential. To everyone&#x27;s complete surprise, it went on to spend nine weeks at #1 during December 1950-January 1951, while &quot;Boogie Woogie Santa Claus&quot; failed to chart at all and was quickly forgotten. &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; also became Page&#x27;s second single to appear on the country charts, becoming her biggest hit there, reaching number two. The song later became one of the best-selling records of its era, selling 7 million copies in the early 1950s. &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; remains the biggest commercial success for the overdubbing technique, pioneered by producer Mitch Miller, which enabled Page to harmonize with herself. &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; was the last song to sell one million copies of sheet music. The song was covered by several other singers during the next few months including Jo Stafford and Les Paul and Mary Ford.

The song was featured in the 1970 film &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; and in the 1983 film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;.

===Breakthrough: 1951–1965===

In 1951, Page covered &quot;Would I Love You (Love You, Love You)&quot;, which had been a hit for Doris Day. Page&#x27;s version was a top-five hit that sold 1 million copies. The next single, &quot;Mockin&#x27; Bird Hill&quot;, (a cover of the original by Les Paul and Mary Ford) was her fourth million seller. Page had three more top 10 hits on &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1951, starting with &quot;Mister and Mississippi&quot;, which peaked at number eight; &quot;And So to Sleep Again&quot;; and &quot;Detour&quot;, which had been recorded and made famous by Spade Cooley, Foy Willing, and Elton Britt. Page&#x27;s version was the most popular and became her seventh million-selling single. She also released her first studio album in 1951 titled &quot;Folk Song Favorites&quot;.

In 1952, Page had a third number-one hit with &quot;I Went to Your Wedding&quot;, which spent two months at number one. Recorded in a country ballad style, the song was the B-side of &quot;You Belong to Me&quot;, also a top-10 hit. &quot;I Went to Your Wedding&quot; was Page&#x27;s eighth million-selling single in the United States. It displaced Jo Stafford&#x27;s version of &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; at number one on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Best Seller chart. She had continued success that year, with three more songs in the top 10, &quot;Come What May&quot;, &quot;Once in a While&quot;, and &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Believe Me&quot;.

In 1953, the novelty tune &quot;(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window?&quot; became Page&#x27;s fourth number-one hit, selling over 1 million copies and staying on the chart for five months. The song included the sound of a dog barking, which made it popular with a younger audience. It became one of her best-loved songs, but in later years would often be lampooned by rock critics and used to ridicule the state of popular music in the 1950s just prior to rock-and-roll. The song was written by novelty-tune specialist Bob Merrill. It was recorded by Page for the children&#x27;s album &quot;Arfie Goes to School&quot;. It was also a UK hit and British singer Lita Roza performed a cover version that made the top 10 there. She had a series of top-20 hits that year. &quot;Changing Partners&quot;, a final single, reached the top five, peaking at number three, and staying on the charts for five months. The song was also a country melody, like many of Page&#x27;s hits at the time.

In 1954, Page had more chart hits, including &quot;Cross Over the Bridge&quot;, which again overdubbed Page&#x27;s vocals and peaked at number two. Other top-10 hits by Page that year included &quot;Steam Heat&quot; (from the Broadway musical &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;) and &quot;Let Me Go Lover&quot;.
In 1955, Page had one chart single: &quot;Croce di Oro&quot;.

Unlike most other pop singers of her time, Page was able to maintain success into the rock-and-roll era. She had three hits in 1956, including the number-two &quot;Allegheny Moon&quot;. In 1957, she had major hits with &quot;A Poor Man&#x27;s Roses (or a Rich Man&#x27;s Gold)&quot; (recorded the same year by Patsy Cline) and the top-five hit &quot;Old Cape Cod&quot;.

In 1956, Vic Schoen became Patti Page&#x27;s musical director, producing her on a long string of hits that included &quot;Mama from the Train&quot;, &quot;Allegheny Moon&quot;, &quot;Old Cape Cod&quot;, &quot;Belonging to Someone&quot;, and &quot;Left Right Out of Your Heart&quot;. Page and Schoen&#x27;s most challenging project was a recording of Gordon Jenkins narrative-tone poem as &quot;Manhattan Tower&quot; (recorded September 1956). The album was a success both artistically and commercially, reaching number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; LP chart, the highest ranking of any of her albums. Schoen&#x27;s arrangements were more lively and jazzy than the original Jenkins arrangements. Schoen recalled, &quot;Patti was an alto, but I pushed her to reach notes higher than she had sung before for this album. We always enjoyed working together.&quot; Page and Schoen continued their collaboration for many years, working together until 1999.

During the 1950s, Page made regular TV appearances, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Bob Hope Specials&quot;, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, and &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;. This eventually led to Page having television specials of her own. She later had her own series, beginning with &quot;Scott Music Hall&quot; in the 1952–53 season and a syndicated series for Oldsmobile in 1955, &quot;The Patti Page Show&quot;. However, this show only lasted one season, as did &quot;The Big Record&quot; (1957–58) and &quot;The Patti Page Olds Show&quot;, sponsored by Oldsmobile (1958–59). Page also began an acting career at this time, beginning with a role on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. Page made her movie debut in 1960 in &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;. She also recorded the theme song for &quot;Boys Night Out&quot;, in which she played the part of Joanne McIllenny. In 1959, Page recorded the title song from the musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; for Mercury Records on the same day that the musical opened on Broadway. The song on her TV show &quot;The Patti Page Olds Show&quot; helped to promote the Broadway show.

The pop world was becoming less favorable to pre-rock singers by 1960 and it was also a weak time for the &quot;established&quot; ASCAP affiliate record labels such as Columbia, RCA, and Mercury, with indie and regional labels dominating pop during this era, so Page&#x27;s chart hits dried up. She did not chart again until 1961 with &quot;You&#x27;ll Answer to Me&quot; and &quot;Mom and Dad&#x27;s Waltz&quot;. Page&#x27;s last major chart hit was &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; from the film of the same name starring Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland. It peaked at number eight. It was her last top-10 hit (and her first since 1957) and was nominated for a &quot;Best Song&quot; Oscar. She performed it at the 1965 Academy Awards. She also recorded the song in Italian, Spanish, and German for foreign markets.

===Adult contemporary and country music: 1966–1982===
Before releasing &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;, Page signed with Columbia Records, where she remained until the end of the decade. She released a few studio albums for Columbia in the 1960s. In 1961, her singles began to chart on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. Many of these singles became hits, peaking in the top 20, including cover versions of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be True, Dear&quot;, &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;, and &quot;Little Green Apples&quot; (the last being her final appearance on the Billboard). Page, who as an Oklahoma native was well-acquainted with country music, recorded many country songs over the years. Some of these were recorded for Columbia and were released as adult contemporary singles, including David Houston&#x27;s &quot;Almost Persuaded&quot; and Tammy Wynette&#x27;s &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;. With Page&#x27;s viability on the pop charts diminishing as she got older and with a radically changed cultural climate in America during the late 1960s, she decided to focus solely on country recordings. In 1970 she left Columbia and came back to Mercury. In 1973, she returned to working with her former record producer Shelby Singleton.

Working for Mercury, Columbia, and Epic in the 1970s, Page recorded a series of country singles, beginning with 1970&#x27;s &quot;I Wish I Had a Mommy Like You&quot;, which became a top-25 hit, followed by &quot;Give Him Love&quot;, which had similar success. In 1971, she released the country music album &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Sorry&quot; for Mercury records. In 1973, a duet with country singer Tom T. Hall titled &quot;Hello, We&#x27;re Lonely&quot; was a top-20 hit, reaching number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart.

In 1973, Page returned to Columbia Records&#x27; affiliate Epic Records. In 1974 and 1975, she released singles for Avco Records, including &quot;I May Not Be Lovin&#x27; You&quot; and a cover of Hoyt Axton&#x27;s &quot;Less Than The Song&quot;, both of which were minor country hits. After a five-year hiatus, she recorded for Plantation Records in 1980. She had a top-40 hit with Plantation in 1981 titled &quot;No Aces&quot;, followed by a series of minor country hits. In the early 1980s, she performed with major symphony orchestras in Cincinnati and Mexico City.

===Later career: 1983–2012===
In 1986, Page and arranger Vic Schoen reunited for a stage show in Las Vegas.

In 1988, Page appeared at the Ballroom in New York, marking the first time that she had performed there in nearly 20 years. She received positive reviews from music critics. In the 1990s, Page founded her own record label, C.A.F. Records, which released several records, including a 2003 children&#x27;s album.

In the early 1990s, Page moved to San Diego, California, and continued to perform live shows at venues across the country.

In 1998, the album &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall: The 50th Anniversary Concert&quot; was released. The album won Page a Grammy Award the following year for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance, which, despite her prolific career, was her first Grammy.

In 1998, a sample of Patti Page&#x27;s recording of &quot;Old Cape Cod&quot; formed the basis of Groove Armada&#x27;s UK hit &quot;At the River&quot;. The lines &quot;If you&#x27;re fond of sand dunes and salty air / Quaint little villages here and there...&quot; sung in Page&#x27;s multitracked close harmony, are repeated over and over, with the addition of synthesizer bass, slowed-down drums, and a bluesy trombone solo to produce a chill-out track. The success of this track introduced Page&#x27;s music to another generation of listeners.

In 1999, Vic Schoen reunited with Page to record a CD for a Chinese label.

In 2000, she released the album &quot;Brand New Tennessee Waltz&quot;. Harmony vocals were provided by popular country stars, including Suzy Bogguss, Alison Krauss, Kathy Mattea, and Trisha Yearwood. The album was promoted at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2000.

On October 4, 2001, Bob Baines, the mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire, declared the day &quot;Patti Page Day&quot; in the town. Miss Page was in Manchester to perform a sold-out concert at the Palace Theater to benefit Merrimack Valley Assistance Program.

In 2004, she appeared on the PBS Special &quot;Magic Moments: The Best of 50s Pop&quot; and sang &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; and &quot;Old Cape Cod&quot;. The DVD includes a backstage interview with Page.

In 2005, she performed a series of engagements at a theatre in Branson, Missouri, starting on September 12.

Until shortly before her death, Page was the host of a weekly Sunday program on the Music of Your Life radio network. Jack White of the White Stripes and she were interviewed in January 2008 after the White Stripes had recorded Page&#x27;s early 1950s hit &quot;Conquest&quot; on their 2007 studio album &quot;Icky Thump&quot;. Page and White were put together on the phone during the interview, talking to each other about their views on &quot;Conquest&quot;.

Page sang &quot;Summer Me, Winter Me&quot; for Michel Legrand&#x27;s 50th-anniversary concert at the MGM Grand, and on the recording, it is evident she had forgotten the words.

Page continued to tour actively until September 2012, when she announced on her web page her retirement from performing for health reasons.

==Style==
During the time of Page&#x27;s greatest popularity (the late 1940s and 1950s), most of her traditional pop music contemporaries included jazz melodies in their songs. Page also incorporated jazz into some of her songs; however, on most of her recordings, Page favored a country music arrangement.

During the late 1940s, when Page recorded for Mercury Records, its top A&amp;R man was Mitch Miller, who, despite having left Mercury for Columbia Records in 1950, produced most of Page&#x27;s music. Miller found that the simple-structured melodies and story lines in country songs could be adapted to the pop market. Page, who was born in Oklahoma, felt comfortable using this idea. Many of Page&#x27;s more successful hits featured a country-music arrangement, including her signature song &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;, as well as &quot;I Went to Your Wedding&quot; and &quot;Changing Partners&quot;. Some of these singles charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart during the 1940s, &#x27;50s, and early &#x27;60s.

Many other artists were influenced by Patti Page, and incorporated country arrangements into their own songs, including The Andrews Sisters and Bing Crosby, who had a number-one hit on the country charts in the late 1940s with &quot;Pistol Packin&#x27; Mama&quot;.

==Personal life==
Page was married three times, first to University of Wisconsin student Jack Skiba in May 1948. They moved to New York, but she asked for and received a no-fault divorce in Wisconsin within a year. Her next marriage was to Charles O&#x27;Curran, a choreographer, in 1956. O&#x27;Curran had been married to actress Betty Hutton. Page and O&#x27;Curran adopted a son, Danny, and a daughter, Kathleen. They divorced in 1972.

Page&#x27;s last marriage was to Jerry Filiciotto in 1990. The couple owned a maple syrup business named The Farm at Woods Hill in Bath, New Hampshire, and resided in Solana Beach, California. Filiciotto died on April 18, 2009.

In his autobiography &quot;Lucky Me&quot;, published in 2011, former baseball player and front-office executive Eddie Robinson claims he dated Page before her second marriage.

Page&#x27;s longtime collaborator arranger Vic Schoen once recalled, &quot;She was one of the nicest and most accommodating singers I&#x27;ve ever worked with.&quot; Schoen and she remained close friends and spoke regularly until his death in 2000.

==Death==
Page died on January 1, 2013, at the Seacrest Village Retirement Community in Encinitas, California, at the age of 85; she had been suffering from heart and lung disease. She was buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego.

<text>WEFG-LD (channel 7) is a low-power television station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The station has been owned by the Philadelphia Television Network since November 10, 1999.

==History==

===Early years===
Channel 7 first appeared in December 1991 as W07CB (&quot;WOCB&quot;), the first Philadelphia-licensed VHF television station since May 1948.

In 1992, W07CB, not affiliated with a major network, aired reruns and old B-movies. Affiliations included the Canadian music video channel MuchMusic, Channel America, and FamilyNet. General Manager and part-owner Ron Joseph telecast reruns of his 1970s-era disco dance shows. The station achieved some degree of success under Joseph&#x27;s stewardship. However, a dispute between the four owners of the station resulted in the decreased influence of Joseph over station affairs.

===Changes===
Within a year, the station underwent a series of management changes. Dr. Walter Moxley IV, an infectious disease specialist with no previous broadcasting experience, was named the new general manager. His son Michael Moxley was brought in to host local programming and acquire new revenue streams. Viewership and revenue picked up, but the station&#x27;s transmitter was vandalized causing the station to go off the air for several weeks. As a result of being off the air, advertisement revenue dried up, and Michael Moxley departed W07CB to attend Penn State.

By June 1994, the station&#x27;s parent company Morton Broadcasting named George Brusstar, operator of small but profitable cable television operations in the Philadelphia suburbs, as its Director of Programming. All of the station&#x27;s programming was abruptly scrapped along with the station&#x27;s then-slogan (&quot;T-V Heaven, Channel 7&quot;). The station&#x27;s new logo became &quot;The Bell&quot;, modeled after Philadelphia&#x27;s Liberty Bell according to Brusstar. Replacing the old disco shows, classic westerns, and vintage sitcoms was a new format of 24-hour &quot;two-way talk&quot; programming featuring live TV hosts sitting at a desk with telephones. Viewers could call in live and sound off on the issues of the day with the hosts. Brusstar hired former Philadelphia radio performer Dennis Marcucci and Modesto, California, television personality Al Mario to host shows on the new lineup. In addition, Brusstar himself was a featured host, and was joined by then-17-year-old Port Richmond resident Mike Phillips.

A contractual dispute in late 1994 resulted in Brusstar&#x27;s sudden departure, and all local programming ceased. Brusstar was replaced by Mario who hired local college students, activists, and radio personalities in an attempt to cement a stable evening line-up. Programs included music (&quot;Dr. Soul&#x27;s Radio on TV&quot;), comedy (&quot;A Sermon from the Reverend Spoonicci&quot;), and current events commentaries from Mario, homelessness activist Leona Smith, and libertarian Sean McBride. From 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., programming consisted of live TV psychics from a low-power New York City station brought in via satellite. By June 1995, infighting between owners forced W07CB off the air.

===Later developments===
When Channel 7 next appeared, it was clear Ron Joseph was back in control; for weeks on end, a two-hour VHS tape loop of his recent wedding played continuously. Joseph attempted to take the station back entirely via a loophole in the partnership agreement (partner Moxley was imprisoned for the assault of a family member). Joseph later operated a low-power TV channel in Wildwood–Cape May, New Jersey, W05AX.

In 1996, with few advertisers left, Morton Broadcasting was dissolved and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license for Channel 7 was sold to Shooting Star Productions. Executive Producer Jerry Leazer created a 24/7 music video programming format concentrating on the music roots of The Sounds Of Philadelphia. The format was an immediate success and Morton Broadcasting spent over a year trying to break the contract between Morton Broadcasting and Shooting Star Productions so they could sell the station for a higher price now that Leazer had dramatically increased the station&#x27;s value. Shooting Star Productions, which had been represented by Reed Smith Shaw and McClay in Philadelphia and Richard Glanton, ultimately sold their interest to Glanton to avoid any further litigation. By the end of the 1990s, Channel 7 reduced its power , and programmed modern rap music videos. It could only be seen from its Philadelphia transmitter, as opposed to a radius just a few years before. The station currently transmits a strongly-directional pattern, aiming most of its signal to the south-southwest portions of Philadelphia with lower power in other directions. This is to protect WABC-TV in New York City, also on Channel 7, about away.

On July 31, 1998, the FCC granted W07CB voluntary transfer of control from Ronald Joseph Caponigro to Digital Media T.V.

On November 10, 1999, Morton Broadcasting Company sold W07CB to Philadelphia Television Network, Inc.

The W07CB call letters were changed to WPTV-LP in November 2001 (not related to full power NBC affiliate WPTV (channel 5) in West Palm Beach, Florida). A month later, the call letters were changed again to WWJT-LP. On January 27, 2010, WWJT received another call sign, WWJT-LD, for the digital facility while still retaining the call sign WWJT-LP for the analog facility. WWJT-LD changed its call sign to WEFG-LD on January 1, 2014.

WWJT was relaunched on October 15, 2006, as African Community Television. The station aired a mix of news, movies, infomercials and music videos, as well as various African shows.

On June 16, 2010, WWJT-LP ceased analog transmission due to its analog transmitter and video server suffering catastrophic failures, keeping the station off the air until the launch of digital WWJT-LD.

Starting on or about November 17, 2011, WWJT-LD began broadcasting a digital signal on virtual channel 7 showing just the call letters and its three sub channels displaying a color test pattern. All four channels are currently in 480i SD digital format.

<doc id="354536" wikidata="Q1937502" url="?curid=354536" title="Son of Dracula (1974 film)">
<text>Son of Dracula is a 1974 British musical film directed by Freddie Francis and starring Harry Nilsson and Ringo Starr. It was produced by Starr and released in 1974 by Apple Films. It is also the title of a soundtrack released in conjunction with the film.

In the film, Count Dracula is assassinated, and his son is supposed to inherit his control over the Netherworld. Instead, the son wishes to become mortal and asks Van Helsing to help him transform into an ordinary human.

==Plot==
After the killing of his father (Count Dracula, the King of the Netherworld), by a mysterious assassin, Count Downe (Harry Nilsson) is summoned from his travels abroad by family advisor Merlin (Ringo Starr) in order to prepare him to take over the throne. Baron Frankenstein (Freddie Jones) is also on hand to help in any way he can. Problem is, Downe wants no part of this responsibility, and instead wishes to become human and mortal − especially after meeting a girl named Amber (Suzanna Leigh), with whom he falls in love. He approaches old family nemesis Dr. Van Helsing (Dennis Price), who agrees to enable the Count&#x27;s transformation, much to the dismay of the residents of the Netherworld.

Despite the best efforts of a host of monsters, as well as one traitorous figure who is dealt with by the trusted Merlin, Van Helsing performs the operation and removes Downe&#x27;s fangs. He then informs the Count that he can now live out his days in the sunlight, with Amber at his side.

Keith Moon of The Who and John Bonham of Led Zeppelin both appear in the film, alternating as the drummer in Count Downe&#x27;s band. Other band members include Klaus Voormann (another old friend of Starr), Peter Frampton, an uncredited Leon Russell, and the regular Rolling Stones horn section of Bobby Keys and Jim Price.

==Production==
&quot;Son of Dracula&quot; was made during a period when Starr, in between occasional single releases and session work, was concentrating on filmmaking and acting. Two films in which he had starred, &quot;200 Motels&quot; and &quot;Blindman&quot;, had been released at the end of 1971, and before starting on this one, he had just finished work on his directorial debut, the T. Rex documentary &quot;Born to Boogie&quot;.

As well as producing &quot;Son of Dracula&quot;, Starr appears as Merlin the Magician, who follows the birth and rise of young Count Downe, played by Nilsson. Starr and he were longtime friends, and the ex-Beatle had recently played drums on Nilsson&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Son of Schmilsson&quot;, which had spoofed horror movie motifs. A few months after those sessions, in August 1972, Starr decided to make a rock and roll Dracula movie (originally titled Count Downe), and invited Nilsson to come on board. At first, Nilsson thought the whole idea must have come from his recent album; as it turned out, Starr had not followed its release, and until then-wife Maureen brought him a copy, he did not even know that &quot;Son of Schmilsson&quot; had already used a similar theme.

Freddie Francis later said &quot;at the end of the film I opted out. I said Ringo look, I&#x27;m ill at the moment, you better cut the film yourself. He had made it with a lot of his friends and that, the least said the better.&quot;

==Release==
Filming was completed by November 1972, but &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; had to wait a year and a half for release. Soon after completion, Starr called in Graham Chapman, who was writing with Douglas Adams at the time and had been working on a proposed (but eventually unfilmed) television special for Ringo. Along with Chapman&#x27;s other regular collaborator, Bernard McKenna, they were asked to write a whole new script to be dubbed over the film&#x27;s lacklustre dialogue, and they recorded an alternative, Pythonesque soundtrack, but the whole idea was then shelved. Later, attempts were made to market the movie, but as Starr later said, ‘No one would take it.’

===Reception===

The film was poorly received. In 2014, &quot;Ultimate Rock Classic&quot; journalist John Giles stated &quot;Creative discipline, in other words, was in short supply – and Son of Dracula needed plenty.&quot; Showings over the years have been limited to midnight movies and similar outlets. No official home video release has ever been made.

==Soundtrack album==

The &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; album includes Nilsson songs that were showcased in the film, as well as some instrumental tracks composed by Paul Buckmaster and portions of dialogue used as bridging sequences. All the song tracks except one are from the previously released &quot;Nilsson Schmilsson&quot; and &quot;Son of Schmilsson&quot; albums.

The only new song, &quot;Daybreak&quot;, was recorded in London sometime in September &#x27;72, during a break in filming. Joining Nilsson and Starr on the sessions at Trident Studios were the likes of Voormann, Frampton, Keys and Price, once again, as well as George Harrison on cowbell. Jim Price, along with pianist Gary Wright and orchestral arrangers Paul Buckmaster and Del Newman, also provided new, incidental music, some of which appeared in the film only.
The U.S. LP release of the soundtrack included a T-shirt iron-on advertising the film, and a companion songbook included a reproduction of the film poster. The single version of &quot;Daybreak&quot; edited out the words &quot;&quot;it&#x27;s pissing me off&quot; (referring to daylight), repeating the lyric &quot;it&#x27;s making me cough&quot;&quot; instead, and the fadeout is longer than on any LP or CD release of the song. The single peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but did not chart at all in the U.K. The album itself fared even worse, non-charting in Britain and climbing no higher than number 106 in America.

&quot;Daybreak&quot; was later covered by Nilsson friend and former Monkee Micky Dolenz. A version with completely new lyrics in German was sung as &quot;Hamburg im Regen&quot; by Mary Roos.

<text>GM Korea Company () is the South Korean subsidiary of multinational corporation General Motors and the third largest automobile manufacturer in South Korea. GM Korea&#x27;s roots go back to the former Daewoo Motors vehicle brand, which was split from its parent company, Daewoo, in 2002. In addition to importing vehicles for sale into South Korea, the company also operates three manufacturing facilities producing vehicles for the domestic market and for export. The company also operates GM Technical Center Korea, a design, engineering, research &amp; development facility for various GM products, primarily small-size cars.

== History ==
=== Predecessors ===

GM Korea&#x27;s roots go back to the remnants of the Korean War and Shinjin Motors, which launched its business by rebuilding scrapped US military vehicles. Shinjin Motor was first established as National Motor in 1937 in Bupyeong-gu, Incheon, Japanese Korea. After changing its name to Saenara Motor in 1962, Saenara Motor was bought by Shinjin Industrial in 1965, which changed its name to Shinjin Motor after establishing a partnership with Toyota. After Toyota&#x27;s withdrawal in 1972 (to keep doing business with China, which would not trade with companies who engaged in South Korea or Taiwan), Shinjin Motor changed its name to GM Korea (GMK) in 1972 with General Motors purchasing a 50% stake in the company from Toyota in 1972; however GMK was renamed again in 1976 to Saehan Motors.
Korea Development Bank (KDB), the company&#x27;s creditor, took over management in 1976 as the company found itself unable to cope with competition from Hyundai and Kia. After Daewoo gained control in 1982, the name was changed once more to Daewoo Motor. In the early 1990s the company started to expand heavily throughout the world. Until 1996 all Daewoo cars were based on GM-designed models. After the 1997 Asian financial crisis reached South Korea, Daewoo took over the troubled SUV manufacturer SsangYong in 1998, but ran into financial trouble and was forced to sell the company off in 2001 to GM affiliate SAIC.

=== Formation of GM Daewoo ===
In 2001, General Motors bought most of Daewoo Motor&#x27;s assets to form &quot;GM Daewoo Auto &amp; Technology&quot;. The new company started operations on 17 October 2002, with GM and its partners Suzuki and SAIC holding a stake of 66.7% with investments of US$400 million. The GM holding was purchased by GM&#x27;s Australian subsidiary, Holden, which held a seat on the board and was legally responsible for GM Daewoo. The remaining equity stake of 33.3% was held by Korea Development Bank and several other Korean creditors with investments of US$197 million. The deal did not include 15 plants, including Daewoo&#x27;s oldest plant in Bupyeong-gu which is now operated under the name Incheon Motor Company as a supplier to GM Daewoo. In 2004, Tata Motors purchased Daewoo Commercial Vehicle, which had been spun out of bankrupt Daewoo Motor Co. in 2002. In February 2005, GM invested US$49 million to raise its share in the company to 48.2%. In 2010, General Motors owned 82.9%, SAIC 9.9%, and the Daewoo Motor Creditors Committee the remaining 7.2%.

On 25 November 2003, the design center was relocated to the new two-story building at the Bupyeong-gu headquarters. The first car to be produced under the GM Daewoo nameplate was the 2002 Daewoo Lacetti, replacing the Nubira. This car was developed in South Korea under the Daewoo Motor era, but it gradually became a GM world car, sold under many different marques all around the globe. After a few years without any new cars to present, in 2005, GM Daewoo introduced the Holden-based Statesman luxury car replacing the discontinued Daewoo Chairman. The third generation of Matiz was introduced, refreshed by the GM Daewoo design team, and an evolution of the four-door Kalos appeared: the Gentra.

In early 2006, GM Daewoo presented Tosca, the replacement of the Magnus. GM Daewoo&#x27;s official press releases says that Tosca is an acronym for &quot;Tomorrow Standard Car&quot;. The end of the same year, GM Daewoo introduced the Winstorm, its first proper sport utility vehicle (SUV), which was, as the Lacetti, sold worldwide under different brands and names including Opel Antara, Chevrolet Captiva and Holden Captiva, and previously Saturn Vue before the demise of the Saturn brand in 2010. It featured a common rail Diesel engine for the first time in a Daewoo vehicle, in addition to regular four and six cylinder gasoline engines. The diesel engine design was licensed from the Italian engine maker VM Motori.

2007 saw the introduction of the Lacetti and Kalos hatchback facelift&#x27;s wagon version, becoming the Gentra X. For 2008, GM Daewoo introduced the first Korean-branded roadster: the G2X sports car, a badge-engineered Pontiac Solstice/Saturn Sky which was based on the GM Kappa platform, and started to sell the Opel Antara under the name of Winstorm MaXX. The Statesman flagship was also replaced by the new Veritas which is now based on the Holden Caprice V. In 2008, GM Korea built more than 1.9 million vehicles, including CKD products.

Late 2008 and early 2009 were a major period for GM Daewoo with the introduction of the all-new Lacetti Premiere, which is based on the Chevrolet Cruze, a very important compact car for GM divisions worldwide. The newly rechristened third generation of the Matiz was added to the range in 2009 as the Chevrolet Spark.

2010 saw the introduction of the Chevrolet Orlando and &quot;Alpheon&quot;, a local version of the Buick LaCrosse.

=== Establishment of GM Korea ===

On 20 January 2011, General Motors announced that GM Daewoo would be renamed &quot;GM Korea&quot; &quot;to reflect Daewoo&#x27;s heightened status in the global operations of GM&quot;, effective March 2011. Most of the remaining Daewoo vehicles were rebadged as Chevrolets, although the Damas/Labo microtrucks were sold without a brand name since 2011.

GM&#x27;s luxury division Cadillac entered South Korea in 1996 and, with a record sales year of 28,000 units in 2017, South Korea became the fifth largest market for Cadillac worldwide (after China, the United States, Canada and the Middle East).

In 2011, the Daewoo Tosca was replaced by a locally built version of the Chevrolet Malibu.

More recently, the low annual incomes a result of lower levels of sales, led to closing the non-profitable factories of the GM Korea unit.

=== GM withdrawal from Europe and crisis ===
Starting from 2014, GM halted sales of all Chevrolet-branded cars in Europe, India, East and South Africa, most of which had up to then been manufactured completely or in part by GM Korea. In 2017, General Motors finalized its move out of the European market by selling the Opel and Vauxhall brands to PSA Group (now part of Stellantis). This caused closure of GM Korea&#x27;s Gunsan plant due to low productivity. The GM Vietnam vehicle assembly plant in Hanoi, which was managed by GM Korea, was sold to VinFast in 2018.

In 2019, GM Korea split its R&amp;D unit, GM Technical Center Korea (GMTCK), into a separate firm despite protests by unions worried about potential layoffs at factories. General Motors announced on 16 February 2020 that &quot;as part of a strategy to exit markets that don&#x27;t produce adequate returns on investments&quot; it was exiting from all right-hand drive markets worldwide, including Australia, New Zealand, and Thailand. This coincided with the demise in 2020 of the Holden brand, hitherto a large distributor of GM Korea products.

In April 2022, GM Korea&#x27;s Bupyeong 2 plant was closed due to reduced productivity. The Spark and Malibu were to be discontinued in the South Korean market by August 2022.

The Bolt EV and Bolt EUV were discontinued in the South Korean market on 1 December 2023.

<text>The gens Fulvia, originally Foulvia, was one of the most illustrious plebeian families at ancient Rome. Members of this gens first came to prominence during the middle Republic; the first to attain the consulship was Lucius Fulvius Curvus in 322 BC. From that time, the Fulvii were active in the politics of the Roman state, and gained a reputation for excellent military leaders.

==Origin==
The nomen &quot;Fulvius&quot; is evidently of Latin origin, and is derived from the cognomen &quot;Fulvus&quot;, originally designating someone with yellowish or golden-brown hair. Cicero reports that the Fulvii originally came to Rome from Tusculum, where some of them remained in his era. According to tradition, they obtained their &quot;sacra&quot; from Hercules after the completion of his twelve labours. By the latter part of the fourth century BC, they had joined the nobiles through the patronage of the Fabii, who supported the successful candidacy of Lucius Fulvius Curvus for the consulship.

==Praenomina==
The earliest branch of the Fulvii used the praenomina &quot;Lucius&quot;, &quot;Marcus&quot;, and &quot;Quintus&quot;, which they occasionally supplemented with other names, including &quot;Gaius&quot;, &quot;Gnaeus&quot;, and &quot;Servius&quot;. &quot;Lucius&quot; disappears early, and was not used by the later Fulvii. The Fulvii Centumali mentioned in history bore &quot;Gnaeus&quot; and &quot;Marcus&quot; exclusively, while the Flacci depended on &quot;Marcus&quot; and &quot;Quintus&quot;, supplemented by &quot;Gnaeus&quot;, &quot;Servius&quot;, and &quot;Gaius&quot;. Fulvii with other praenomina occur toward the end of the Republic.

==Branches and cognomina==
The Fulvii of the Republic bore a variety of cognomina, including &quot;Bambalio&quot;, &quot;Centumalus&quot;, &quot;Curvus&quot;, &quot;Flaccus&quot;, &quot;Gillo&quot;, &quot;Nobilior&quot;, &quot;Paetinus&quot;, and &quot;Veratius&quot; or &quot;Neratius&quot;.

&quot;Curvus&quot;, which means &quot;bent&quot; or &quot;crooked,&quot; is the first cognomen of the Fulvii to occur in history, and belongs to a large class of surnames derived from a person&#x27;s physical characteristics. Members of this family subsequently bore the surnames &quot;Paetinus&quot; and &quot;Nobilior&quot;, which displaced &quot;Curvus&quot;.

&quot;Paetinus&quot;, derived from &quot;Paetus&quot;, was a common surname originally referring to someone with a slight cast in the eye. Pliny the Elder mentions it alongside &quot;Strabo&quot;, which also indicated a defect of vision, but Horace indicates that &quot;Paetus&quot; describes a lesser distortion than &quot;Strabo&quot;, giving as an example a father referring to his son as &quot;Paetus&quot;, although he was called &quot;Strabo&quot;, since his eyesight was not that poor. The slight distortion indicated by &quot;Paetus&quot; was even considered endearing, and it was an epithet of Venus, with much the same meaning as the modern proverb, &quot;love is blind&quot;.

As the cognomen of &quot;Curvus&quot; was superseded by that of &quot;Paetinus&quot;, so the latter was in turn superseded by &quot;Nobilior&quot;, meaning &quot;very noble&quot;. This name seems to have been first assumed by the consul of 255 BC, perhaps with the implication that he was more noble than the other Fulvii; his descendants dropped the name of &quot;Paetinus&quot;.

&quot;Centumalus&quot; is a cognomen of obscure meaning. From the filiation of Gnaeus Fulvius Maximus Centumalus, the consul of 298 BC, and the first of this surname, it appears probable that he was the brother of Marcus Fulvius Paetinus, the consul of the preceding year, in which case the Centumali were also descended from the Fulvii Curvi.

&quot;Flaccus&quot;, meaning &quot;flabby&quot;, or &quot;flop-eared&quot;, was the name of a prominent family of the Fulvia gens, which first appears in history around the beginning of the First Punic War. They were presumably descended from the same family as the other Fulvii of the Republic, but the exact manner of the relationship is unclear, unless perhaps they were descended from a younger son of Marcus Fulvius Curvus Paetinus, consul in 305 BC.

The surname &quot;Bambalio&quot;, belonging to one of the Fulvii of Tusculum, alluded to his tendency to stammer.

To this list, some scholars append &quot;Nacca&quot;, or &quot;Natta&quot;, a fuller, based on a Lucius Natta, supposedly the brother-in-law of Publius Clodius Pulcher. Cicero mentions this Natta on two occasions, but does not mention his gentile name. Servius calls him Pinarius Natta, in a passage of uncertain genuineness, but the only known wife of Clodius was Fulvia; thus it has been speculated that her brother could have been Lucius Fulvius Natta, although that surname is otherwise unknown in the Fulvia gens. Ronald Syme argued that it was possible that Natta was a maternal half-brother of Fulvia, from her an earlier marriage of her mother to a Pinarius Natta. Drumann, however, provides reason to suppose that Clodius was married twice, and that his first wife was Pinaria; in which case Natta was not the brother of Fulvia.

==Members==
===Fulvii Curvi, Paetini, et Nobiliores===
* Lucius Fulvius, the grandfather of Lucius Fulvius Curvus, consul in 322 BC.
* Lucius Fulvius L. f., the father of Lucius, consul in 322 BC.
* Gnaeus Fulvius, the grandfather of Marcus Fulvius Paetinus, consul in 299 BC.
* Gnaeus Fulvius Cn. f., the father of Marcus, consul in 299, and perhaps also of Gnaeus Fulvius Maximus Centumalus, consul in 298.
* Lucius Fulvius L. f. L. n. Curvus, consul in BC 322, with Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus. Supposedly he had been consul of Tusculum at the time that town revolted against Rome, but upon going over to the Romans, was invested with the same office. He and his colleague triumphed over the Tusculans, and in some accounts, over the Samnites as well. Magister equitum in 316, he and the dictator, Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus, besieged Saticula, and defeated the Samnites.
* Marcus Fulvius L. f. L. n. Curvus Paetinus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in 305 BC, following the death of the consul Tiberius Minucius Augurinus in battle against the Samnites. According to some accounts, he took the town of Bovianum, and celebrated a triumph over the Samnites.
* Marcus Fulvius Cn. f. Cn. n. Paetinus, consul in BC 299.
* Gaius Fulvius Curvus, one of the plebeian aediles in 296 BC; he and his colleague used fines from grazers to host games, and donate golden chalices to Ceres
* Marcus Fulvius M. f. L. n. Paetinus, the son of Marcus Fulvius Curvus Paetinus, consul in 305 BC, and father of Servius Fulvius Paetinus Nobilior, consul in 255.
* Servius Fulvius Paetinus M. f. M. n. Nobilior, consul in BC 255, with Marcus Aemilius Paullus, during the First Punic War. Following the defeat of Regulus in Africa at the beginning of the year, the consuls were dispatched with a fleet of at least three hundred ships to bring away the survivors. Near Hermaea, the Roman fleet gained a brilliant victory over the Carthaginians, who suffered very heavy losses. On its return to Italy, the fleet met a fearful storm, and was almost totally destroyed; but both consuls survived, and celebrated a triumph in the following year.
* Marcus Fulvius Ser. f. M. n. Nobilior, the son of Servius Fulvius Nobilior, consul in BC 255, and father of Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, consul in 189.
* Marcus Fulvius M. f. Ser. n. Nobilior, as praetor in 193 BC, obtained the province of Hispania Ulterior, where he defeated the Vaccaei, Tectones, and Celtiberi, receiving an ovation; as consul in 189, and fought against the Aetolians, triumphing the following year. He was censor in 179.
* Quintus Fulvius Nobilior, one of the triumviri appointed in 184 BC to establish colonies at Potentia and Pisaurum. Cicero identifies him with the consul of 153 BC, who was the son of the consul of 189; but it is improbable that someone who held such an important office in 184 should have been elected consul thirty-one years later; and a Quintus Fulvius Nobilior whom Livy mentions as a boy in 180 would have been the right age to achieve the consulship in 153, but certainly would not have been given the responsibility of establishing two colonies while still a child, four years earlier.
* Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, military tribune in 180 BC, he served under the consul Aulus Postumius Albinus Luscus in Liguria. After dismissing his forces without authority, he was punished by being sent to Hispania Ulterior. Broughton notes great difficulty determining his identity, due to a number of similarly named Fulvii, and inconsistent sources.
* Marcus Fulvius M. f. M. n. Nobilior, consul in BC 159, he appears to have carried on the war against the Eleates in Liguria, over whom he celebrated a triumph the following year.
* Quintus Fulvius M. f. M. n. Nobilior, consul in BC 153, the first year that the consuls entered upon their office upon the kalends of January, instead of the ides of March. Sent against the Celtiberi, he suffered a terrible defeat on the day of the Vulcanalia, the 23rd of August, a day which was ever after ill-omened to all Roman generals. Although Fulvius was able to inflict severe losses on the enemy, a stampede of his own elephants led to a second devastating defeat later in the year. He was censor in 136.
* Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, one of Catiline&#x27;s conspirators. A man of this name was condemned in BC 54, on unknown charges; he may be the same person.

===Fulvii Centumali===
* Gnaeus Fulvius Cn. f. Cn. n. Maximus Centumalus, consul in 298 BC, triumphed over the Samnites and the Etruscans. Probably the same man as the Gnaeus Fulvius Maximus Centumalus who was dictator in 263 BC.
* Gnaeus Fulvius Cn. f. Cn. n. Centumalus, consul in BC 229 with Lucius Postumius Albinus; they conducted the war in Illyria, with great success, and Fulvius triumphed over the Illyrians.
* Gnaeus Fulvius Cn. f. Cn. n. Centumalus Maximus, consul in 211 BC; his command prolonged the following year, he was defeated and perished in battle against Hannibal.
* Marcus Fulvius Centumalus, praetor &quot;urbanus&quot; in BC 192, superintended the building of fifty quinqueremes, in preparation for the war against Antiochus the Great.

===Fulvii Flacci===
* Marcus Fulvius, the grandfather of Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, consul in 264 BC, might perhaps be the same as Marcus Fulvius Curvus Paetinus, the consul of 305.
* Quintus Fulvius M. f., the father of Marcus, consul in 264 BC.
* Marcus Fulvius Q. f. M. n. Flaccus, consul in 264 BC, the year in which the First Punic War broke out.
* Quintus Fulvius M. f. Q. n. Flaccus, consul in 237, 224, 212, and 209 BC, magister equitum in 213 and dictator in 210; he was one of Rome&#x27;s most successful generals, before and during the Second Punic War, but his legacy was tarnished by the severity with which he treated the defeated Capuans in 211.
* Gnaeus Fulvius M. f. Q. n. Flaccus, praetor in 212 BC, during the third consulship of his brother, Quintus; he received Apulia as his province, and was defeated with great losses by Hannibal near Herdonia. Charged with losing his army through lack of caution and prudence, he was found to have behaved cowardly, and went into voluntary exile at Tarquinii.
* Gaius Fulvius M. f. Q. n. Flaccus, served as legate under his brother, Quintus, at the siege of Capua, 211 BC. In 209, he was ordered to conduct a detachment of troops into Etruria, and bring back to Rome the legions which had been stationed there. He might be the same Gaius Fulvius who, as quaestor in 218, had been captured by the Boii.
* Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, one of the &quot;decemviri agris assignandis&quot;, appointed in 201 BC to assign lands in Samnium and Apulia to veterans who had served under Scipio in Africa.
* Gnaeus Fulvius (Flaccus), Praetor &quot;Peregrinus&quot; in 190 BC.
* Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, one of the triumvirs appointed to conduct colonies to Pollentia and Pisaurum, in 184 BC.
* Quintus Fulvius Cn. f. M. n. Flaccus, praetor in 187 BC, and consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in 180. As consul, he received the province of Liguria. He sent 7,000 Apuani to Samnium.
* Quintus Fulvius Q. f. M. n. Flaccus, as praetor in 182 BC, he received the province of Hispania Citerior, where he won several victories over the Celtiberians, triumphing in 180 BC. He was consul in 179, with his brother, Lucius Manlius Acidinus Fulvianus, and triumphed over the Ligurians. He was censor in 174.
* Gnaeus Fulvius Q. f. M. n. Flaccus, brother of the consul of 179 BC, was expelled from the senate during the latter&#x27;s censorship.
* Marcus Fulvius Q. f. M. n. Flaccus, served as legate under his brother, Quintus, against the Celtiberians, 182 BC.
* (Lucius?) Fulvius Q. f. M. n. Flaccus, a younger son of the consul of 237, 224, 212, and 209 BC; he was adopted by Lucius Manlius Acidinus, and became Lucius Manlius Acidinus Fulvianus. As praetor in 188 BC, he obtained the province of Hispania Citerior, where he remained until 186, defeating the Celtiberi; in consequence he received an ovation. He was consul in 179 BC, with his brother, Quintus, who had triumphed over the Celtiberi the preceding year.
* Servius Fulvius Q. f. Flaccus, consul in 135 BC, subdued the Vardaeans in Illyricum. Cicero calls him a literary and eloquent man. He was on one occasion accused of incest, and was ably defended by Gaius Scribonius Curio.
* Gaius Fulvius Q. f. Cn. n. Flaccus, consul in 134 BC, during the First Servile War; he obtained the command in Sicily, and proceeded against the slaves, but with little success.
* Marcus Fulvius M. f. Q. n. Flaccus, consul in 125 BC, aided the Massilians against the Saluvii, and triumphed over the transalpine Ligures. A staunch ally of Gaius Gracchus, and supporter of his agrarian law, his attempts to supply Gracchus with an armed force led to failed negotiations with the senatorial party, and he was put to death, together with his elder son.
* Fulvia M. f. M. n., daughter of the consul of 125 BC, married Publius Cornelius Lentulus, and was the mother of Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura.
* Fulvia M. f. M. n., married a brother of Quintus Lutatius Catulus.
* Fulvia M. f. M. n., married Lucius Julius Caesar, consul in 90 BC.

===Fulvii Gillones===
* Quintus Fulvius Gillo, a legate of Scipio Africanus, who sent him to Carthage in 203 BC. He was praetor in 200, and obtained Sicily as his province.
* Gnaeus Fulvius (Q. f.) Gillo, probably the son of Quintus, was praetor in 167 BC, and received the province of Hispania Citerior.
* Marcus Fulvius Gillo, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 76, and governor of Asia from 89 to 90.
* Quintus Fulvius Gillo Bittius Proculus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 98. His stepdaughter was the second wife of Pliny the Younger.

===Others===
* Marcus Fulvius Bambalio, of Tusculum, a man of no account, married Sempronia, daughter of Sempronius Tuditanus. Their daughter, Fulvia, was the wife of Marcus Antonius. Fulvius received the nickname &quot;Bambalio&quot; on account of a hesitancy in his speech.
* Fulvia M. f., daughter of Marcus Fulvius Bambalio, married Publius Clodius Pulcher; after his murder in 52 BC, she married Gaius Scribonius Curio. Following his death in the African War, 49 BC, she became the third wife of Marcus Antonius, the triumvir; in 41 she helped to instigate the Perusine War.
* Publius Fulvius Veratius or Neratius, whom Cicero calls a &quot;lectissimus homo&quot;, accused Titus Annius Milo in BC 52.
* Aulus Fulvius, a member of the second Catilinarian conspiracy, in 63 BC. While he was on his way to Catiline, his father was informed of his son&#x27;s design, and, overtaking him, ordered that the younger Fulvius be put to death.
* Fulvia Pia, the mother of Lucius Septimius Severus, emperor from AD 193 to 211.
* Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, praetorian prefect under Septimius Severus, to whom he may have been related. Having achieved great wealth and power, he succeeded in having his daughter, Fulvia Plautilla, married to Caracalla, the future emperor. But as Caracalla despised both his bride and his father-in-law, Plautianus anticipated his downfall, and in AD 203 was put to death on the accusation that he was plotting against the emperor and his family.
* Fulvia Plautilla, the wife of Caracalla, was banished and put to death in AD 212, following the murder of the emperor&#x27;s brother, Geta.
* Fulvius Plautius, the brother of Fulvia Plautilla, along with whom he was banished and put to death in AD 212.
* Fulvius Diogenianus, a former consul, noted for his imprudent freedom of speech during the reign of Macrinus.
* Fulvius, &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; in AD 222, was torn to pieces, along with Aurelius Eubulus, by the soldiers and people, in the massacre which followed the death of Elagabalus, and was succeeded in office by the notorious Eutychianus Comazon. He may perhaps be the same person as the consular, Fulvius Diogenianus.
* Gaius Fulvius Maximus, legate of Dalmatia in the reign of Severus Alexander.
* Marcus Laelius Fulvius Maximus Aemilianus, consul ordinarius in AD 227.
* Fulvius Pius, consul in AD 238.
* Fulvius Aemilianus, consul in AD 244.

<doc id="354551" wikidata="Q333487" url="?curid=354551" title="Malcolm Rifkind">
<text>Sir Malcolm Leslie Rifkind (born 21 June 1946) is a British politician who served in the cabinets of Margaret Thatcher and John Major from 1986 to 1997, and most recently as chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament from 2010 to 2015. He is also known for his advocacy of a pro-European stance within his party&#x27;s policies.

Rifkind was the MP for Edinburgh Pentlands from 1974 to 1997. He served in various roles as a Cabinet minister, including Secretary of State for Scotland from 1986 to 1990, Defence Secretary from 1992 to 1995, and Foreign Secretary from 1995 to 1997. In 1997, his party lost power and he lost his seat to the Labour Party. He attempted, unsuccessfully, to be re-elected in Pentlands in 2001; the constituency was abolished before the 2005 general election and he was adopted, and subsequently elected, as the Conservative candidate for Kensington and Chelsea. He announced his intention to seek the leadership of the party before the 2005 Conservative leadership election, but withdrew before polling commenced.

Rifkind stood for the Kensington seat and was elected at the 2010 general election with a majority of 8,616 votes. He was appointed Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, on 6 July 2010. In January 2015 he was appointed by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as a member of their Eminent Persons Panel on European Security. He did not stand in the 2015 general election. In December 2015, Rifkind was appointed a visiting professor by King&#x27;s College, London in their Department of War Studies. He was invited to become a Distinguished Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). In July 2016, his memoirs, &quot;Power and Pragmatism&quot;, were published.

==Early life==
Rifkind was born in Edinburgh to a Jewish family that emigrated to Britain in the 1890s from Lithuania; among his cousins were Leon and Samuel Brittan. He was educated at George Watson&#x27;s College and the University of Edinburgh where he studied law before taking a postgraduate degree in political science (his thesis was on land apportionment in Southern Rhodesia). While at university he took part in an overland expedition to the Middle East and India. He also appeared on &quot;University Challenge&quot;.

He worked as an assistant lecturer at the University College of Rhodesia in Salisbury (now Harare) from 1967 to 1968. He was called to the Scottish Bar in 1970 and practised full-time as an Advocate until 1974. He was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1985 and a member of the Privy Council in 1986. From 1970 to 1974 he was a member of Edinburgh City Council.

==Member of Parliament==
Rifkind first stood for Parliament, unsuccessfully, in 1970 in the Edinburgh Central constituency. He entered Parliament in the February 1974 general election representing Edinburgh Pentlands for the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. During the leadership election in 1975, he supported Edward Heath in the first round but when Heath withdrew Rifkind voted for Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher, on becoming leader, appointed Rifkind an Opposition front-bench spokesman on Scottish Affairs. He subsequently resigned from that position (along with the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Alick Buchanan-Smith) in protest at the decision of the Shadow Cabinet to vote against the Government&#x27;s Bill for a Scottish Assembly. Rifkind argued that as, at that time, the Conservative Party supported the principle of a Scottish Assembly, it would have been preferable either to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill or to abstain, and try to improve the Bill. In the subsequent referendum on a Scottish Assembly, Rifkind voted in favour, but withdrew his support when the result of the referendum showed Scotland almost equally divided over the proposal.

===Junior Minister===

Rifkind was one of only five Ministers (Tony Newton, Kenneth Clarke, Patrick Mayhew and Lynda Chalker are the others) to serve throughout the whole 18 years of the Governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major. This represents the longest uninterrupted Ministerial service in Britain since Lord Palmerston in the early 19th century.

He was appointed Minister of Home Affairs and the Environment at the Scottish Office in the 1979 Thatcher Government. In that role, he was responsible for the passage of the Tenants&#x27; Rights (Scotland) Act which resulted in a massive increase of home ownership in Scotland as council tenants bought their homes. He was also responsible, under the Secretary of State George Younger, for relations with local government and for the police and prisons.

In 1982, at the time of the Falklands War, he was transferred to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, being promoted to Minister of State at the Foreign Office in 1983. At the Foreign Office, he served first under Francis Pym and then Sir Geoffrey Howe. Rifkind was responsible for Britain&#x27;s relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the European Community, and sub-Saharan Africa. He assisted Sir Geoffrey Howe in persuading Thatcher to change the Government&#x27;s policy on the Soviet Union, attended the Chequers meeting which decided to invite Soviet leaders to the United Kingdom, and was present at Chequers when Thatcher had her first meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev and decided that he was a Soviet leader with whom &quot;she could do business&quot;.

Rifkind also had strong links with the Solidarity movement in Poland. In 1984, he made a Ministerial visit to Poland. Against the wishes of General Jaruzelski, the Polish Communist President, he insisted on laying a wreath at the grave of the murdered Polish priest Father Jerzy Popiełuszko, and had a meeting with three of the leaders of the banned Solidarity movement. Jaruzelski attacked Rifkind and cancelled a meeting he was due to have with him but Rifkind&#x27;s meeting with Solidarity created a precedent that was followed by the West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and other Western ministers. This helped force the Polish Government to remove the ban on Solidarity and acknowledge the need for political reform and pluralism. Rifkind was, subsequently, decorated by the non-communist democratic Polish Government for his support. Rifkind, as Minister responsible for the European Community, was appointed by the Prime Minister as her personal representative on the Dooge Committee of the European Community. The Report of the Committee helped prepare the way for the development of the Single European Market.

===Secretary of State for Scotland===

In 1986 he was promoted into the cabinet as Secretary of State for Scotland. He gained a reputation as being a moderate voice on social and economic issues, and sometimes had disputes with Margaret Thatcher. As Secretary of State, he initiated major reforms in Scotland. These included the privatisation of the Scottish electricity industry and the Scottish Transport Group. He created Scottish Homes as the Government&#x27;s housing agency; and Scottish Natural Heritage which combined both the Countryside Commission for Scotland and the Nature Conservancy Council. He also transformed the Scottish Development Agency into Scottish Enterprise with much greater private sector involvement. When Rifkind became Secretary of State his first task was to defuse a teachers dispute which was crippling Scottish education. He also sought to help the Ravenscraig steel mill which was threatened with closure. Rifkind opposed closure by the Government arguing that the whole steel industry should be privatised and that the future of individual plants would be determined by the companies that owned them in the private sector.

One of Rifkind&#x27;s most difficult challenges was the demand from the public for the abolition of the domestic rates system. He supported the introduction of the Poll Tax, which the Cabinet had approved shortly before his appointment. He also agreed with the decision proposed by his predecessor, George Younger, that the new tax should be introduced a year earlier in Scotland than in England because of the political necessity to end the domestic rates. Rifkind subsequently accepted that the poll tax had been a major mistake by the Government. Throughout his term as Scottish Secretary, Rifkind, like Younger before him, and Ian Lang and Michael Forsyth in later years, was constrained by the political weakness of the Conservative Party in Scotland unlike in England. This problem was the underlying reason for his differences with Margaret Thatcher which increased, significantly, towards the end of her Prime Ministership. When Thatcher was challenged by Michael Heseltine for the Leadership of the Conservative Party, Rifkind voted for her. During the tense period that followed the first round of voting Rifkind was one of those who advised Thatcher that it would be best for her to stand down, and did not promise to support her if she stood for election. Thatcher considered his action treachery. In the subsequent Leadership election, he supported Douglas Hurd.

===Secretary of State for Transport===

In 1990, he was moved by John Major to be Secretary of State for Transport. One of his first responsibilities was to go into the Channel Tunnel, which was being constructed, and witness the first physical contact between those tunnelling from the French and British ends of the tunnel. One of his main priorities as Transport Secretary was to take forward the policy proposals for the privatisation of the railways. Rifkind supported privatisation but concluded that it would be a mistake to separate ownership of the infrastructure from the operating companies as track costs were a large percentage of their unavoidable costs. This view brought him into conflict with the Treasury and meant that Conservative proposals for privatisation were not ready by the time of the 1992 general election. The Prime Minister favoured the Treasury argument that competition between railway companies would be discouraged if one company owned the track. Rifkind maintained that the competition to rail would come from air and road and not from other rail companies. After Rifkind left the Ministry of Transport in 1992, the Treasury view prevailed, and this led to the creation of Railtrack.

===Secretary of State for Defence===

Rifkind was appointed Secretary of State for Defence after the 1992 general election. Although he had no military background, he was a firm believer in strong defence and armed forces with a global capability. One of his early decisions was to reverse the proposed disbandment of the Cheshire and Staffordshire Regiment and the Royal Scots and King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. In 1994, he was faced with Treasury demands for major cuts in the Defence budget. In order to protect the fighting capability of the armed forces, he negotiated a settlement with the Treasury whereby he would deliver savings greater than they were demanding but that he would be allowed to keep the additional savings and use them for the purchase of new military equipment for each of the three Services. He had already won the support of the Chiefs of Staff for this approach which provided an incentive for their cooperation in making the necessary economies. The outcome was the Front Line First Report, which was well-received both in Parliament and in the Armed Forces. However, some of its proposals, particularly in regard to defence medical services were, in later years, subjected to heavy criticism. With some of the additional savings that had been found Rifkind was able to secure the agreement of the United States to British purchase of cruise missiles. The United Kingdom was, at that time, the only country to which the Americans were willing to sell cruise missiles. Rifkind also reformed the Reserve Forces and initiated the policy review which led to the TA and other Reservists being able to be used in operations abroad without the need for full mobilization of the whole Territorial Army as had been needed in the past.

One of the most difficult problems that Rifkind dealt with as Defence Secretary was British involvement in the Bosnian War in former Yugoslavia. Like John Major and the Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, Rifkind was opposed to military intervention by Britain and the international community as combatants in that conflict. However, he supported the use of British troops and those from other countries to protect humanitarian food convoys that were protecting hundreds of thousands of civilians. Rifkind was a strong and vocal opponent of the American proposal for &quot;lift and strike&quot; which would have ended the UN Arms Embargo and subjected the Bosnian Serbs to NATO bombing from the air. Rifkind agreed with the UN and European view that such bombing would be incompatible with a UN mission on the ground and would necessitate the ending of that mission. Rifkind expressed these views publicly in Washington as well as in London. Although the United States was increasingly frustrated and concerned at this impasse it did not do lasting damage to US-British relations as evidenced by the American willingness to sell cruise missiles to the United Kingdom.

===Foreign Secretary===
In the final years of the Major administration, Rifkind was the Foreign Secretary. One of his first duties was to chair the London Summit on Bosnia which put much greater pressure on the Bosnian Serbs in the aftermath of the Srebrenica massacre and led, in due course, to the Dayton Accord which ended the fighting. As Foreign Secretary, on 24 September 1996, Rifkind addressed the United Nations General Assembly and called for a UN Declaration barring political asylum for terrorists, arguing that they should not be able to benefit from the provisions of the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees to secure political asylum. In the same speech, he emphasised Britain&#x27;s commitment to the goal of global free trade by 2020 and said all governments should liberalise their economies and lift trading restrictions.

In the Middle East, Rifkind committed the British Government, for the first time, to a Palestinian State on the West Bank and in Gaza. He also, in a speech in the Gulf, called for a Middle Eastern equivalent of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to enable dialogue to take place, at the regional level between Israel and its Arab neighbours as well as between Iran and the Arab world. One of his main duties was the final negotiations with China over the transfer of Hong Kong. Rifkind had several meetings with the Chinese Foreign Minister both in Beijing and in London, as well as with the Hong Kong Governor, Chris Patten, and elected Hong Kong politicians. Rifkind also, as Foreign Secretary, called for the creation of a North Atlantic Free Trade Area that would have created a free-trade relationship between the European Union and the United States and Canada.

==Election defeat and return to parliament==

At the 1997 general election, he lost his Pentlands seat in common with all Conservatives in Scotland (and Wales), and was succeeded by Labour candidate Lynda Clark. Rifkind was one of the few MPs to try again in his old seat, rather than seeking a safer one, standing again for Edinburgh Pentlands against Clark in the 2001 general election; although he improved his showing somewhat, he was unable to overturn the sizeable 10.6% majority in an election where the Conservatives made little progress. During this time, he remained politically active, as president of the Scottish Conservatives, and used his position outside Westminster to criticise the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the Blair Government&#x27;s support of it. At the time, the Conservative Party was staunchly in support of the invasion.

Following the 1997 general election, Rifkind was offered a peerage which he declined. He received a knighthood in John Major&#x27;s resignation honours, becoming a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), in recognition of his work for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.

At the 2005 general election, he returned to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for the London constituency of Kensington and Chelsea with a majority of 12,418.

===Leadership contender and thereafter===

On 8 June 2005, a month after the Conservative defeat at the 2005 general election, Rifkind stated that it was &quot;quite likely&quot; that he would stand for the leadership after Michael Howard&#x27;s resignation. Rifkind subsequently confirmed this on 14 August, although admitting that he had a &quot;mountain to climb&quot;, and receiving sparse support amongst Conservative MPs, with several exceptions, such as Crispin Blunt.

Despite this, Rifkind went through to the &quot;conference stage&quot; of the leadership process, in which each candidate was given speaking time to address the Conservative Party Conference directly. In his speech, Rifkind declared that Conservatives had to be &quot;pragmatic, sensitive, and moderate&quot;, and stress their &quot;unique combination of principle and patriotism&quot;. The speech won eight rounds of applause from the conference, with nearly a minute-long finale.

The speech did not galvanise Rifkind&#x27;s candidacy, however, which had always been regarded as a long shot – bookmakers had him at 50–1 and a poll found that only 4% of Conservative voters supported his candidacy. Consequently, on 11 October 2005 he announced that he was withdrawing from the leadership contest and that he would be supporting Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s candidacy, acknowledging that &quot;There is no realistic prospect of me coming through&quot;. In endorsing Clarke, Rifkind stated that he was &quot;head and shoulders&quot; above the other candidates, and had both the experience and popular appeal to take on Labour.

On 7 December 2005, he left the Conservative front bench as incoming leader David Cameron formed his team. Rifkind admitted that he had not wished to remain a Shadow cabinet minister unless in the post of Shadow Foreign Secretary, but this post had gone to William Hague. Rifkind declared his loyalty to the new party leader and remains one of the Conservative Party&#x27;s most experienced senior figures.

In December 2008, he became a leading spokesman of the Global Zero movement, which includes over 300 eminent leaders and over 400,000 citizens from around the world working toward the elimination of all nuclear weapons by multilateral negotiation. In July 2010, he was appointed by the Secretary General of the Commonwealth as a member of the Eminent Persons Group, chaired by a former Prime Minister of Malaysia, which has been requested to report to the next Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on recommendations for the future revitalisation of the Commonwealth.

He was Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee of the House of Commons until the dissolution of Parliament on 12 April 2010. When the Kensington and Chelsea constituency was realigned to create the new seats of Chelsea and Fulham and Kensington, Rifkind stood for the latter seat and was elected at the 2010 general election with a 50.1% share of the total votes cast, and a majority of 8,616 votes.

===Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee===

Rifkind was appointed Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, on 6 July 2010, a post he held until 24 February 2015. As Chairman of the ISC Rifkind presided over the transformation of the Committee&#x27;s powers to ensure that it had effective oversight of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. He persuaded the Government to introduce legislation which enabled the ISC, for the first time, to be able to require, rather than request, the intelligence agencies to provide any highly classified material required by the ISC. The legislation also gave the ISC, for the first time, explicit authority to provide oversight over the operations of the intelligence agencies rather than just their policy, resources and organisation. During his period as Chairman, the ISC held its first-ever public sessions including a live televised session with the heads of MI5, MI6, and GCHQ.

 Rifkind supported the NATO military intervention in Libya and supplying arms to the Libyan rebels.
On 28 August 2013, Rifkind appeared to modify his anti-war principles by advocating British military intervention in the Syrian civil war, subject to certain important caveats. He stated that the best response to proof of the Syrian Government&#x27;s use of chemical weapons against its own people would be United Nations Security Council approval of proportionate and limited military action, but that securing unanimity in the Council would be unlikely, given the near-certainty of a Russian veto. He believed that, in such a case, if there were to be a broad international consensus for such military action, including among the nations of the Arab League, the international community should not be &#x27;paralysed&#x27; by a failure to act, and that the action should be used to target Syrian Government military sites. He believed its purpose should be to deter the Syrian Government from using such weapons again, and to indicate that wider action would be undertaken were it to do so. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he accused the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of being willing to &quot;do anything that they think they can get away with to stay in power&quot;, but then claimed that for Britain, in the event of broad international consensus for military action against the Syrian Government&#x27;s use of chemical weapons, there was &quot;no choice but to take military action with or without a UN mandate&quot;.

On 18 March 2014, during an interview with CBC Radio News, Rifkind spoke out against the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, stating that this risked destabilising the entire area and European politics in general. In his opinion, Ukrainian forces had demonstrated &quot;remarkable restraint&quot; against Russian &quot;humiliation&quot;, and had turned their military disadvantage into a substantial &quot;moral advantage&quot;. While declaring &quot;robust economic sanctions&quot; to be the best response to Crimean situation, and describing a number of possible options, he nevertheless referred to the Western implementation as &quot;pathetic&quot;, claiming that current measures affected a mere 23 individuals, and inferred this to be the reason why Russia seemed unfazed by sanction threats. Because of his criticism of Russian action in Crimea and eastern Ukraine Rifkind was included in a list of senior European politicians and former Ministers banned from visiting Russia. Rifkind responded by saying that if there had to be such a list he was proud to be on it.

In November 2014, the ISC published its report on the murder of Lee Rigby, on which he said of Facebook:

The obligatory internet rights group warned against co-opting companies and turning them into an arm of the surveillance state, and David Cameron vowed to take action. The committee noted the problem to be acute but were somewhat assuaged by the appointment of the Special Envoy on intelligence and law enforcement data sharing and by the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014; they also suggested that government should prioritise the issue with the National Security Council.

===Conflict of interest controversy===
In early 2015, Rifkind had discussions with what he thought were representatives of a Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. They turned out to be journalists for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and Channel 4 News who recorded the conversations. As a result, he was suspended from the Conservative party while the matter was investigated.

On 24 February 2015, Rifkind stepped down from his position as Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee while remaining on the Committee. Shortly afterwards he announced that he would not stand as a candidate for his constituency of Kensington at the 2015 general election. The former foreign secretary said it was &quot;quite obvious&quot; that allegations made following an undercover sting had &quot;become an issue&quot;. Rifkind said he had stepped aside as chair of the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) because he did not want the work of the committee to be &quot;distracted&quot;. Speaking to reporters after a meeting of the ISC, he said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I did anything wrong. I may have made errors of judgement, but that&#x27;s a different matter.&quot; In September 2015 the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and the Standards Committee of Parliament concluded after a seven-month investigation that there had been no impropriety by Rifkind. They severely criticised Channel 4 Dispatches and the Daily Telegraph for &quot;distortion&quot;, and for &quot;misleading the public&quot;. Media regulator Ofcom however took a different view, judging in December 2015 that the journalists had investigated a matter of significant public interest and that their presentation had been fair.

==Personal life==
Rifkind married Edith Amalia, daughter of Polish airforce engineer Joseph Steinberg, in London in 1970. They were the parents of Caroline, and &quot;The Times&quot; columnist Hugo Rifkind. He was also a distant cousin of his late Conservative government colleague Leon Brittan, and is a second cousin once removed of producer and DJ Mark Ronson.

Lady Rifkind died on 20 October 2019 at the age of 72.
On 1 November 2022, Rifkind married Mrs Jennifer (Sherrie) Bodie at Chelsea Town Hall.

==Other positions and memberships==
In December 2020, the University of London appointed Rifkind as Chairman of an Inquiry into the future of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies. The Committee concluded that the Institute should not be closed as originally proposed by the University but should continue and be expanded. The University accepted all the recommendations of the &quot;Rifkind Committee&quot;.
In February 2022 Rifkind was invited to preach the Perse Sermon at Evensong in the chapel of Gonville&amp;Caius College, Cambridge University

<text>The gens Mamilia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome during the period of the Republic. The gens was originally one of the most distinguished families of Tusculum, and indeed in the whole of Latium. It is first mentioned in the time of the Tarquins; and it was to a member of this family, Octavius Mamilius, that Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, betrothed his daughter. The gens obtained Roman citizenship in the 5th century BC, and some of its members must subsequently have settled at Rome, where Lucius Mamilius Vitulus became the first of the family to hold the consulship in 265 BC, the year before the First Punic War.

==Origin==
The Mamilii traced their nomen and origin to the mythical Mamilia, the daughter of Telegonus, who was regarded as the legendary founder of Tusculum and the son of Ulysses and the goddess Circe. This origin was referred to on a coin of the gens, the obverse of which depicts the head of Mercury or Hermes, the ancestor of Ulysses, and the reverse Ulysses himself, clad in the humble disguise he assumed to avoid being recognized by the suitors of Penelope.

==Praenomina==
The earliest of the Mamilii to occur in history bore the praenomen &quot;Octavius&quot;, which was rare at Rome. His descendants used the praenomina &quot;Lucius, Quintus, Gaius&quot;, and &quot;Marcus&quot;, all of which were very common names throughout Roman history.

==Branches and cognomina==

The Mamilii were divided into three families, with the cognomina &quot;Limetanus, Turrinus&quot;, and &quot;Vitulus&quot;, of which the two latter were the most ancient and important. &quot;Limetanus&quot; is the only surname which occurs on coins.

&quot;Vitulus&quot; was a surname in both the Mamilia and Voconia gentes. Niebuhr supposes that &quot;Vitulus&quot; is merely another form of &quot;Italus&quot;, and remarks that we find in the same manner in the Mamilia gens the surname &quot;Turrinus&quot;; that is, &quot;Tyrrhenus&quot;, an Etruscan. &quot;It was customary, as is proved by the oldest Roman Fasti, for the great houses to take distinguishing surnames from a people with whom they were connected by blood, or by the ties of public hospitality.&quot;

The ancients, however, connected the surname &quot;Vitulus&quot; with the Latin word signifying a &quot;calf&quot;, which was depicted on a coin of one of the Voconii Vituli. Although the connection of &quot;Turrinus&quot; and &quot;Tyrrhenus&quot; is by no means impossible, or even unlikely, it could also have been derived from &quot;turris&quot;, &quot;a tower&quot;. An ancient tower known as the &quot;Turris Mamilia&quot; stood in the Subura, and figured in a ritual battle between the residents of two neighborhoods at Rome for the head of the October Horse.

==Members==

<text>Zebrahead is an American rock band from La Habra, California, formed in 1996. The group&#x27;s current line-up comprises rapper Ali Tabatabaee, bassist Ben Osmundson, drummer Ed Udhus, lead guitarist Dan Palmer and lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Adrian Estrella. Playing a style of music that merges elements of pop-punk and hip hop music, they have released thirteen studio albums.

The band was formed in 1996 by Tabatabaee, Osmundson and Udhus, as well as vocalist and rhythm guitarist Justin Mauriello and lead guitarist Greg Bergdorf. Mauriello departed from the group in 2004, following the release of the band&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Waste of MFZB&quot;. His role was filled in 2005, with the addition of Matty Lewis, who made his debut on &quot;Broadcast to the World&quot; (2006). Bergdorf then departed from the group in 2013, being replaced by Palmer, who was first featured on &quot;Call Your Friends&quot; (2013). In 2021, Lewis left the band and was replaced by Estrella.

== History ==

=== 1996–2001: Formation and early years ===

Zebrahead was formed in La Habra, California in summer 1996 by guitarist Greg Bergdorf and drummer Ed Udhus, (both formerly of the band 409), bassist Ben Osmundson (formerly of 3-Ply) and singer/rhythm guitarist Justin Mauriello (formerly of Once There). All four musicians, whose bands at the time shared the same practice space, became acquainted with one another after experimenting with different music styles together. This led to all four leaving their respective bands and forming their own and naming it Zebrahead. Inspired by bands such as Fugazi and Descendents and uninterested in the local musical trends of the time, Zebrahead began experimenting and incorporating elements of hip-hop into their sound, leading to the inclusion of rapper Ali Tabatabaee as a co-vocalist. The first song ever composed was &quot;Check&quot;, which was later included on their first demo tape, &quot;One More Hit&quot;, released shortly after.

The band issued their self-titled debut album in April 1998 through indie label Doctor Dream Records, before signing with major label Columbia Records to release their mainstream debut &quot;Waste of Mind&quot; later that year. The album contains several re-recorded songs from their demo release alongside new tracks, including the minor radio hit &quot;Get Back&quot;, which charted at No. 32 on the U.S. Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts. This album&#x27;s version of &quot;Check&quot; also appeared on the soundtrack for the game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;.

The band&#x27;s follow-up &quot;Playmate of the Year&quot; was released in August 2000 and charted at No.4 on the U.S. Top Heatseekers chart. The extended play &quot;Stupid Fat Americans&quot; followed in February 2001 as a Japan-exclusive release.

=== 2002–2005: &quot;MFZB&quot; and Mauriello&#x27;s departure ===
Zebrahead recorded and released their fourth studio album, &quot;MFZB&quot;, in 2003; this was their last publication under Columbia Records. The album is noted for trading in the hip-hop funk elements of the band&#x27;s previous releases in favor of a heavier punk rock sound that would eventually carry over and develop in future releases. Zebrahead spent the majority of 2004 promoting the album at various festivals in Japan, including the Summer Sonic Festival. The band&#x27;s extensive touring earned them a sizeable fanbase in the country, leading &quot;MFZB&quot; to chart at No.9 on the Japanese Charts and earn a gold certification. A follow-up to &quot;MFZB&quot; titled &quot;Waste of MFZB&quot; – containing songs that didn&#x27;t make the final cut of the former – was released exclusively in Japan in July 2004 where it topped the &quot;Billboard Japan&quot; chart.

Shortly after Zebrahead&#x27;s Japanese tour, co-vocalist/rhythm guitarist Justin Mauriello left the band due to creative differences. As the singing/rapping dynamic between Mauriello and co-vocalist Ali Tabatabaee was crucial to Zebrahead&#x27;s sound, the band immediately began the search for a replacement. Matty Lewis, a former member of the band Jank 1000 that had previously toured with Zebrahead, was advised by Udhus and Osmundson to try out for the part in December 2004, to which he won. Lewis&#x27; inclusion was announced at a private concert at the Anaheim House of Blues, California on March 8, 2005, before the group started recording their next studio album.

=== 2006–2012: &quot;Broadcast to the World&quot;, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Panty Raid&quot; and &quot;Get Nice!&quot; ===

Zebrahead&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Broadcast to the World&quot; debuted in February 2006 in Japan, where it certified gold. It was later issued in other countries as the year progressed. During that time, the band toured the U.S. as part of the Warped Tour festival and later Europe, notably playing at the UK&#x27;s annual Download Festival. Ali Tabatabaee and Matty Lewis also performed the theme of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)&quot;, &quot;His World&quot;.

Following a two-month hiatus after writing material for their seventh album, Zebrahead returned to Europe in May 2007 on a co-headline tour with MxPx&lt;ref name=&quot;No UK dates for MXPX/Zebrahead, only Europe&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to tour the UK as part of the annual Get Happy Tour the following October. Afterwards, the band continued writing and recorded demos with producers Jason Freese, Howard Benson and Cameron Webb. The album, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, was released in July 2008, preceded by the &quot;Not the New Album EP&quot; a day earlier. The band later returned to the UK and performed at the Download, Leeds Slam Dunk and Greenfield festivals, before going on to tour the rest of Europe and Japan for the remainder of the year. An American leg of the tour was originally planned to take place after, however, Lewis became ill, and in order to avoid permanent damage to his voice, the tour was cancelled.

In Spring 2009, Zebrahead announced the release of a cover album featuring songs originally sung by female musicians from the 1990s–2000s for the following November. &quot;Panty Raid&quot; is preceded by the single &quot;Girlfriend&quot; originally by Avril Lavigne. To promote it, the band began the Less Than Jake tour in late 2009 and toured through Japan and Europe, eventually concluding in the U.S. in Spring 2010. In the fall that followed, the band had started recording original material for the first time since the release of &quot;Phoenix&quot;. Proceeded by the singles &quot;Ricky Bobby&quot; and the title track &quot;Get Nice!&quot;, Zebrahead&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Get Nice!&quot; was released in July 2011, reaching No. 3 on the U.S. Top Heatseekers chart. Promotion came in the form of the tour Get Nice! or Die Trying, where the band performed in venues and festivals throughout Europe, Japan and Australia and the United States between the album&#x27;s release and the summer of 2012.

=== 2013–2020: &quot;Call Your Friends&quot;, &quot;Walk the Plank&quot; and &quot;Brain Invaders&quot; ===
After recording in the first half of the year, Zebrahead&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;Call Your Friends&quot; was released worldwide in August 2013. Around the same time, the band announced the departure of guitarist Greg Bergdorf, who chose to leave in order to spend more time with his family. Lead guitarist of Death by Stereo, Dan Palmer took his place as the band&#x27;s new guitarist. Zebrahead then toured in the U.S., Europe and Japan over the course of the following year, this time alongside acts MxPx and Allister. In October 2014, the band released their live DVD &quot;Way More Beer&quot;, which was filmed and recorded during the band&#x27;s tour of Germany earlier that year.

In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of Zebrahead&#x27;s formation, the band released their first compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits? – Volume 1&quot; on March 11, 2015, exclusively in Japan. As well as familiar material, the compilation features several re-recorded songs from the band&#x27;s earlier albums with former lead singer/rhythm guitarist Justin Mauriello, this time featuring current lead Matty Lewis. The re-recorded songs were released separately outside Japan as the band&#x27;s eleventh studio album under the title &quot;The Early Years – Revisited&quot; on April 21, 2015.

After recording earlier in the year, Zebrahead&#x27;s twelfth album &quot;Walk the Plank&quot; was issued on October 7, 2015. A continuation of their Walk the Plank/Out of Control tour that took place earlier that year ran between October 1 – December 11, 2015, in Japan and Europe. The band released a second compilation album on November 24, 2017, titled &quot;The Bonus Brothers&quot;, featuring songs that were previously only available on the Japanese editions of their albums, while their thirteenth studio album &quot;Brain Invaders&quot; was released in March 2019.

=== 2021–present: Lewis&#x27; departure and &quot;III.II.I&quot;===
In April 2021, Zebrahead announced the departure of co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, Matty Lewis. Adrian Estrella (Assuming We Survive and Mest) was revealed as his replacement on June 28, 2021. The band&#x27;s first single with Estrella, &quot;Lay Me to Rest&quot;, premiered the following month on July 30, 2021 while the EP &quot;III&quot;, the band&#x27;s first release with Estrella, followed on November 26, 2021. The band&#x27;s follow-up EP, titled &quot;II&quot;, was released on February 3, 2023. &quot;I&quot; was released on November 13, 2024.

== Musical style ==

&quot;AllMusic&quot; described Zebrahead&#x27;s music as punk rap, and also said that they are a rap rock group that &quot;[owes] far more to the old school than the new&quot;. &quot;Faster, Louder&quot; categorized them as &quot;pop-punk/rapcore exponents&quot;. &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; said that the band &quot;combined the pop-punk cuteness of Blink-182 with the rap-metal aggression of Limp Bizkit.&quot;

<text>The secretary of state for transport, also referred to as the transport secretary, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, with overall responsibility for the policies of the Department for Transport. The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.

The office holder works alongside the other transport ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for transport, and the secretary of state is also scrutinised by the Transport Select Committee.

The position of secretary of state for transport is held by Heidi Alexander, who was appointed by Keir Starmer following the resignation of Louise Haigh.

==History==
The Ministry of Transport absorbed the Ministry of Shipping and was renamed the Ministry of War Transport in 1941, but resumed its previous name at the end of the war.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation was created by Winston Churchill in 1944 to look at peaceful ways of using aircraft and to find something for the aircraft factories to do after the war. The new Conservative government in 1951 appointed the same minister to both Transport and Civil Aviation, finally amalgamating the ministries on 1 October 1953.

The Ministry was renamed back to the Ministry of Transport on 14 October 1959, when a separate Ministry of Aviation was formed.

Transport responsibilities were subsumed by the Department for the Environment, headed by the secretary of state for the environment from 15 October 1970 to 10 September 1976.

The Department for Transport was recreated as a separate department by James Callaghan in 1976.

The super-department Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions was created in 1997 for Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott.

In 2001, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions was widely considered unwieldy and so was broken up, with the Transport functions now combined with Local Government and the Regions in the DTLR (Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions).

<doc id="354559" wikidata="Q3378901" url="?curid=354559" title="Philemon Wright">
<text>Philemon Wright (September 3, 1760 – June 3, 1839) was a farmer, lumberman and entrepreneur who founded the Ottawa River timber trade in 1806. He was also founder of what he named Columbia Falls Village, mostly known as (or Wrightstown) and Wright&#x27;s Village to others, the first permanent settlement in the National Capital Region of Canada. Wright&#x27;s Town, later became incorporated in 1875 and renamed Hull, Quebec, and then in 2002, as a result of a municipal amalgamation, it acquired its present name of the City of Gatineau.

==Biography==
Wright was born in Woburn, Massachusetts, into the family of Thomas Wright and Elizabeth Chandler, a large and prosperous Woburn family that had been among the town&#x27;s founders, 120 years before. Philemon Wright was raised as a farmer. At the young age of 16, he was thrust into service for two years with the rebel forces in the first years of the American Revolution, leaving service as a sergeant. He fought in several battles including the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775. Nicknamed &quot;the Old Squire&quot; by his employees and friends, Wright was once described by John Mactaggart as &quot;about six feet high, a tight man, with a wonderfully strange, quick reflective wild eye”.

On May 16, 1782, Philemon Wright married Abigail Wyman, a Woburn woman whose ancestors were among the founding families of Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1628. Charlestown would later become Boston. Philemon and Abigail would have a large family of 8 children. Their children (ages listed as of 1800, when they arrived in Hull Township) were: Philemon Jr., 18; Tiberius, 13; Abigail (Nabby, who died at 7 yrs.); Mary (Polly) 10; Ruggles, 8; Abigail, 6; Christopher Columbus, 2; Christiana, b. 1803.

==Settlement of Wright&#x27;s Town==
Feeling the strain of overpopulation in Massachusetts, Wright first came to see the isolated and unsettled area of the Ottawa Valley in 1796, returned again in 1798, and once more in 1799. He finally decided that the best location for a new settlement would be next to the Chaudière Falls, near the intersection of the Tenàgàtino-sibi or Gatineau and Kitchi-sibi or Ottawa rivers, where he found thousands of acres of good soil and vast amounts of timber. He applied for the lands of the Township of Hull under the &quot;leader and associates&quot; regime and after swearing allegiance to the Crown, received the grant.

Wright used his natural leadership abilities to convince a group of Massachusetts settlers to come north with him. He sold his holdings in Woburn and led a group of 4 other families and 33 labouring men to the area, leaving on February 2, 1800, at the age of 39. With the help of a native Algonquin scout, who volunteered to help the group negotiate the treacherous voyage over ice from Kinodjiwan or Long-Sault at Carillon to the Akikodjiwan or Chaudière Falls, the group arrived on the western shore of the Gatineau River where it meets the Ottawa on March 7, 1800, and began to clear land. At first, their objective was to clear what was needed for homes and farmland for their survival. Two farms, the &quot;Gateno Farm&quot; (1800), as he named it, and the &quot;Columbia Falls Farm&quot; (1801) were the first to be cleared. Then, in 1801, at the foot of the Chaudière Falls, construction began on other enterprises. Wright preferred to call the falls the Columbia Falls, but the name never stuck. The name Columbia, however, was repeatedly used throughout the new settlement: Columbia Pond (now, Leamy Lake), the Columbia farm, the Columbia hotel, and Columbia road (now, St. Joseph blvd.).

 Wright&#x27;s settlement quickly became Wright&#x27;s Town with the shops, mills and other enterprises that were built so that the small community would not be dependent on the expensive practice of importing goods from Montreal. Wright built a lumber mill, a hemp and grist mill and a smithy to fulfill their needs. When a fire burned down the smithy, he rebuilt it in stone, adding a trip hammer mill, four forges and four bellows operated hydraulically. He built a large bakehouse, shops for a shoemaker, a tailor, a bark grinding mill, as well as a tannery for curing leather. Always the opportunist, he also saw to it that a brewery and distillery were operating to slake the thirsts of the many employees he employed. Before long, he and his wife Abigail also saw to it that there was a teacher to teach all of the children in the community.

The process was long and difficult and by 1806 Wright had nearly exhausted his original capital of $20,000. In an effort to earn money and in order to keep his workers busy in the wintertime, he began the cutting of timber. Then, he attempted what was then thought impossible: to build a raft of timber and float it all the way to Quebec City. There, it would be sold for export to Britain. He built the first raft at the mouth of the Gatineau River. Then, on June 11, 1806, he, his 17 yr-old son Tiberius and just 3 other men (London Oxford, a free black man &amp; friend/associate of Philemon, Martin Ebert, and John Turner) began the treacherous journey down the Grand (Ottawa) River. Despite taking two months and encountering many hurdles he reached Quebec on August 12, and sold his 700 logs and 6000 barrel staves. The timber trade on the Ottawa River had begun.

He founded several companies, among them a limestone quarry for building-stone and producing cement, The Hull Mining Company and P. Wright &amp; Sons which, in particular, made him a great deal of money exporting timber, during the Napoleonic Wars when Britain was cut off from its traditional Baltic region suppliers.

As a pioneer and an entrepreneur, Wright had few equals. He was the point man for every builder, land speculator and government project in the region. According to John Mactaggart, the Royal Engineer in charge of the construction of the Rideau Canal and a contemporary of Philemon Wright, Wright should also be credited with having been the person who first suggested the building of the Rideau Canal, and once the canal&#x27;s construction was under way, Wright secured most of the contracts for supplies, materials and craftsmen.

Despite his many achievements, he and his community faced near bankruptcy on several occasions, especially because of fluctuating tariffs in the timber industry, later on. His earliest efforts to establish his settlement almost exhausted his entire capital and then, when his town was ravaged by a disastrous fire in May 1808, the village was practically wiped out. A despondent Wright was ready to abandon the venture and possibly would have, if not for the encouragement he received from his sons Philemon Jr. and Tiberius to rebuild. They rebuilt the grist, hemp, sawmills, and a larger foundry within 6 months.

In 1819, Wright established the first passenger ship service on the Ottawa River. The first ship he used was the &quot;Packet&quot;, a four-ton vessel propelled by “sail and oars”. That same year, he and his son Philemon Jr. contracted Thomas Mears to construct a steamboat, which resulted in the &quot;Union of the Ottawa&quot;, which first set sail in 1823. The &quot;Union&quot; is described as “...measuring 125 feet on the deck, by 23 feet beam, drawing but little water, carrying 150 tons, and propelled by a 28-horsepower engine.”

Wright&#x27;s son Ruggles Wright traveled to Europe to learn Scandinavian timber methods, and armed with this knowledge, returned home and constructed the first ever timber slide in Canada on the north side of the Chaudière Falls in 1829, which allowed logs to be transported over the falls without having to use the previous method of waiting for calm water, which could take weeks.

By 1820, Wright&#x27;s Town was properly established. The population was 703, all either native New Englanders or first-generation Canadians. There were five mills, four stores, three schools, two hotels, two distilleries, and a brewery. For livestock, the count was 123 horses, 418 oxen, 503 cows, 505 pigs, and 558 sheep.

==Political career==
Wright was elected to the legislature of Lower Canada to represent Ottawa County in 1830 and he and his settlement both saw great success. He voted against the Ninety-Two Resolutions. He was also the leader of Freemasonry in the area for many of the villagers and surrounding communities.

==Wright farms==
Although he and his family spent their lives as lumber barons, Philemon Wright was always a farmer at heart. He was a strong advocate for &quot;scientific farming&quot; and selective breeding, and he was the first person to import prize Devon and Herefordshire cattle to the Ottawa Valley. In 1813, Wright sold 3,000 bushels of wheat in Quebec for $3.00 a bushel (this astronomically high price courtesy of the War of 1812). By 1823, the Wright family had created several large and lucrative farms, some of which covered most of the land occupied by present-day Hull &amp; Aylmer. These included the Gatteno Farm near Leamy Lake, the Columbia Falls Farm (at Wright&#x27;s village), The Columbia Farm (Chelsea Rd.), The Dalhousie Farm (by Leamy Lake), the Britannia Farm (on the Britannia Turnpyke), the Chaudière Farm (where Aylmer began), the second Gatteno Farm (east side of the Gatineau) and the Onslow farm (Township of Onslow). In fact, Wright&#x27;s agricultural community, at the time of his death in 1839, was the most developed of Lower Canada. From Onslow Township (present-day Wyman) to present-day Buckingham, Philemon Wright owned 36,978.5 acres (over 150 km2) The fame of Hull as an agricultural community in Canada, the US and Britain was well deserved.

The Gatteno Farm was the site of the original clearing by the Wright expedition in 1800, where stood Philemon Wright&#x27;s first cabin he affectionately called &quot;The Wigwam&quot;. His second home, a bigger home with a stone foundation, was built just north of the Wigwam. In 1801, at the Chaudière Falls, Wright &amp; his sons created the Columbia Falls Farm and that is the location where Wright&#x27;s Town grew up. In 1810, Philemon Sr. moved to his third home, built on the Columbia Falls Farm, on its 800 acres. He lived in that home until 1818, when he handed it over to his son Ruggles, along with the reins of all of the family&#x27;s Chaudière operations. Eventually this property was purchased by E.B.Eddy and he tore down the Wright home and built a mansion named &quot;Standish Hall&quot;. That 1st mansion burnt down in 1900 and he built another that ultimately became the very popular Hotel in Hull by the same name, where Louis Armstrong and many big bands came to play. Philemon&#x27;s 4th home was built just west of the Standish Hall near the Chaudière Falls and was a grand home he named &quot;The White House&quot;. The White House closely resembled the Wright Farm home in Winchester Massachusetts where Wright grew up. Almost a perfect copy of Wright&#x27;s White House can be found at the Billings estate in Ottawa and given that Braddish Billings started his career in the employ of Wright, it may be no surprise that Billing&#x27;s &quot;grand, genteel&quot; home, as he called it, would have been modeled after The Squire&#x27;s, as Philemon was often referred to by his friends.

When Philemon Sr. moved to the Columbia Falls Farm in 1810, the Gatteno farm was put in the hands of Philemon Jr. and Sarah Wright, where Sarah, principally, raised animals and operated a distillery. It eventually ended up in the hands of Andrew Leamy who married Erexina Wright, the daughter of Sarah and Philemon Wright Jr. The Columbia Farm of was located at the junction of what would be the Brigham Road (now Gamelin) and Columbia Road (now boul. St. Joseph), and was operated first by Philemon Jr., then eventually owned by Thomas Brigham, who had married Philemon Sr.&#x27;s daughter, Abigail. The Britannia Farm, on the road leading to Aylmer, was owned by Philemon Jr. as was the Dalhousie Farm, south of what is now Leamy Lake. The Britannia Farm is now the site of the Royal Ottawa Golf Club, the Champlain &amp; Château Cartier golf clubs. A farm at Lac Deschênes in Aylmer, called the Chaudière Farm, was established in 1818 by Philemon Jr. also a store and Inn was built at the landing.

After Philemon Jr.&#x27;s tragic death in a stagecoach accident on Dec. 5th, 1821, Philemon Jr.s&#x27; heirs ended up losing ownership of the Britannia Farm and only retained ownership of the Gatteno Farm because of some dubious paperwork that Wright Sr. had fabricated. He confessed to this in a codicil to his Will, dated 1838. In 1826, Philemon Jr.&#x27;s widow, Sarah (Sally) Olmstead Wright, married Nicholas Sparks (politician), who was then in the employ of P. Wright &amp; Sons. Sparks would become a wealthy landowner &amp; politician in the future Bytown. In 1822, Philemon Sr. gave the Chaudière Farms to Tiberius and Ruggles, and in 1823, he put the Chaudière Farm under the supervision of Charles Symmes, his nephew. The Dalhousie Farm went to Ephraim Chamberlain who was married to Philemon Sr.&#x27;s daughter Mary (Polly) Wright. As well, there were additional Wright farms along the Mountain Road.

Tiberius Wright established the (second) Gatteno Farm in 1816, which his son Alonzo Wright would inherit. By 1823, nearly at this farm had been cleared. It occupied the site of the current Collège St-Alexandre in Limbour.

==Retirement &amp; death==
At the end of his life, Philemon Sr. retired to another farm, this time in Onslow Township, Lower Canada (now the province of Quebec). Wright owned 12,000 acres that spanned the entire width of the County in the first six ranges of Onslow Township. In Wright&#x27;s papers, in the National Archives of Canada, he frequently refers to his properties in Onslow, both his timber cutting operations and his farming activities there, listing acreages of oats and potatoes and his numbers of cattle. Unfortunately he did not state who was living on the properties or looking after his interests in the township. Joseph Bouchette&#x27;s map, dated 1831, shows a few buildings and a road in the easternmost lots on the river, which is most likely to be the location of Philemon&#x27;s Onslow Farm. Philemon Wright&#x27;s brother-in-law, Joseph Wyman, and his son Joseph Jr., who also came from Woburn, obtained several hundred acres in the west end of the township through Wright. They named the new settlement Woburn after their New England home, and brought in other settlers. Woburn was later renamed Billerica (after Billerica, Mass.) and the name was eventually changed to Wyman.

Wright died on June 3, 1839, in Wright&#x27;s Town, and is buried in St. James Anglican Cemetery, Gatineau (Hull Sector). He was survived by a large family, including his son Ruggles Wright who invented the timber slide.

Philemon Wright is regarded as the founder of both the cities of Ottawa and of Gatineau. Philemon Wright High School in Gatineau is named after him.

==Genealogical relationships==
Interesting research through the years has established that through his own family and that of his wife, Abigail, Philemon Wright&#x27;s family members are related to every President of the United States with the exception of Martin Van Buren and Donald Trump, and also related to the English Royal family

<text>The gens Manlia was one of the oldest and noblest patrician houses at Rome, from the earliest days of the Republic until imperial times. The first of the gens to obtain the consulship was Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus, consul in 480 BC, and for nearly five centuries its members frequently held the most important magistracies. Many of them were distinguished statesmen and generals, and a number of prominent individuals under the Empire claimed the illustrious Manlii among their ancestors.

==Origin==
The Manlii were said to hail from the ancient Latin city of Tusculum. The nomen &quot;Manlia&quot; may be a patronymic surname, based on the praenomen &quot;Manius&quot;, presumably the name of an ancestor of the gens. The &quot;gens Manilia&quot; was derived from the same name, and its members are frequently confused with the Manlii, as are the Mallii. However, &quot;Manius&quot; was not used by any of the Manlii in historical times. The Manlii were probably numbered amongst the &quot;gentes maiores&quot;, the greatest of the patrician families. As with many patrician gentes, the Manlii seem to have acquired plebeian branches as well, and one of the family was tribune of the plebs in the time of Cicero. The plebeian Manlii were probably descended from freedmen of the patricians, from members who had gone over to the plebeians, or from unrelated persons who acquired the nomen after obtaining the franchise from one of the Manlii.

==Praenomina==
The Manlii used the praenomina &quot;Publius, Gnaeus, Aulus, Lucius&quot;, and &quot;Marcus&quot;. The Manlii Torquati also favored the name &quot;Titus&quot;, using primarily that, &quot;Aulus&quot;, and &quot;Lucius&quot;.

A well-known story relates that after Marcus Manlius Capitolinus was condemned for treason, the Roman Senate decreed that henceforth none of the gens should bear the praenomen &quot;Marcus&quot;. However, this legend may have originated as a way to explain the scarcity of the name amongst the Manlii, as the name was rarely used in later generations.

==Branches and cognomina==
The earliest cognomen found amongst the Manlii is &quot;Cincinnatus&quot;, better known from the Quinctia gens. This name originally referred to a person with fine, curly hair. The descendants of Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus bore the surname &quot;Vulso&quot;, meaning &quot;plucked&quot;, perhaps chosen for its contrast to &quot;Cincinnatus&quot;. Münzer, noting that the cognomen &quot;Cincinnatus&quot; is missing from the older historians, supposed that it might be a mistake, and that &quot;Vulso&quot; was the original surname of the Manlian gens. The Manlii Vulsones flourished for over three hundred years.

The Manlii Capitolini were descended from the Vulsones, and first appear in the second half of the fifth century BC. The surname &quot;Capitolinus&quot; probably indicates that the family lived on the Capitoline Hill, although the role of Marcus Manlius in saving the Capitol from the Gauls during the sack of Rome in 390 BC is also credited with establishing the name in his family. The surname was relatively short-lived amongst the Manlii, being replaced by that of &quot;Torquatus&quot;. This surname was first acquired by Titus Manlius Imperiosus, who defeated a giant Gaul during a battle in 361 BC, and took his &quot;torque&quot; as a trophy, placing it around his own neck. The descendants of Torquatus remained prominent until the final decades of the Republic, and adopted the torque as an emblem upon their coins. &quot;Imperiosus&quot;, a cognomen borne by Torquatus and his father, was bestowed on account of their imperious manner. The Manlii Torquati were firmly aligned with the aristocratic party toward the end of the Republic, siding first with Sulla, then with Pompeius and the &quot;Liberatores&quot;. In later times, &quot;Torquatus&quot; was borne by the Junii Silani, who were descended from the Manlii.

The Manlii Acidini rose to prominence during the Second Punic War, but achieved only one consulship, in 179, before fading into relative obscurity. They still flourished in the time of Cicero, who praises their nobility.

From coins of the Manlii featuring the inscriptions &quot;SER&quot; and &quot;SERGIA&quot;, Münzer concluded that one &quot;stirps&quot; of this gens bore the cognomen &quot;Sergianus&quot;, indicating descent from the Sergia gens. However, this probably referred to the &quot;tribus&quot; Sergia; a plebeian branch of the Manlii used the name of their tribe to distinguish themselves from the patrician Manlii, a practice also found among the Memmii.

Towards the end of the Republic, several early Manlii appear without cognomina, such as Quintus and Gnaeus Manlius, tribunes of the plebs in 69 and 58 BC.

A number of scholars identify him with the decemvir of 451, but this seems doubtful on chronological grounds; he was probably the decemvir&#x27;s father.
* Aulus Manlius Cn. f. P. n. Vulso, one of the ambassadors sent to research Greek laws in 454 BC, and subsequently one of the decemvirs elected in 451.

* Publius Manlius L. f. A. n. Vulso, praetor in BC 210, received Sardinia as his province. He minted coins during his magistracy.
* Gnaeus Manlius Cn. f. L. n. Vulso, curule aedile in 197 BC, praetor of Sicily in 195, and consul in 189 BC. As proconsul of Asia in 188–187, he negotiated the Treaty of Apamea with Antiochus III.
* Lucius Manlius Cn. f. L. n. Vulso, praetor in 197 BC, received Sicilia as his province. He was also legate to his brother Gnaeus, the consul of 189, during his campaign in Asia. In 188, he demanded from Antiochus III his oath to uphold the Treaty of Apamea.
* Publius Manlius Vulso, praetor in 195 BC, was later again praetor in 182 BC.
* Aulus Manlius Cn. f. L. n. Vulso, one of the triumvirs appointed to establish a colony in the territory of Thurii and Frentinum from 194 to 192 BC. He was praetor &quot;suffectus&quot; in 189, and consul in 178. He was assigned the province of Cisalpine Gaul, whence he attacked and conquered Istria.
* Lucius Manlius Vulso, ambassador in Bythinia 149 BC.

* Lucius Manlius A. f. A. n. Capitolinus Imperiosus, dictator in 363 BC, and father of Titus Manlius Imperiosus Torquatus. He was prosecuted in 362 by the tribune Marcus Pomponius for having stayed in power for more than six months, and for his cruelty toward some citizens and his own son, the future Torquatus, who nonetheless forced Pomponius to drop the charges against his father.
* Gnaeus Manlius L. f. A. n. Capitolinus Imperiosus, consul in 359 and 357 BC, and Interrex in 355.

===Manlii Torquati===

He is equally remembered for the severe discipline that he imposed upon his eldest son during his final consulship.
* Titus Manlius T. f. L. n. Torquatus, while serving as prefect in 340 BC, he was put to death by his father, the consul, after disobeying orders to engage an enemy champion in single combat, hoping to replicate his father&#x27;s feat.

* Titus Manlius T. f. T. n. Torquatus, possibly a praetor circa 69 BC. He studied under Apollonius Molon in Rhodes and was promised to the consulship, but died before he could be eligible.
* Manlia T. f. T. n., married her cousin Aulus Manlius Torquatus, the praetor of 70 BC.
* Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, the natural son of the consul of 65 BC, he was adopted into the Manlii by Titus Manlius Torquatus after the death of his natural son. The adoption was just an artifice to make him eligible to the college of augurs, as it already counted a member of the gens Cornelia (Faustus Cornelius Sulla), but none of the Manlii. Spinther did not even make the pretext of changing his name.
* Aulus Manlius A. f. T. n. Torquatus, praetor in 70, then propraetor of Africa in 69, and &quot;quaesitor&quot; in 52. He was also a legate of Pompeius in 67, tasked with the surveillance of the east of Spain and the Balearic Islands. He married his cousin, Manlia.

* Titus Manlius A. f. A. n. Torquatus, present in the house of Caesar, where the case against Deiotarus was heard in 45 BC.

===Manlii Acidini===
* Lucius Manlius L. f. Acidinus, praetor &quot;urbanus&quot; in 210 BC and proconsul of Hispania in 206, where he succeeded Scipio Africanus. He stayed in command there until 200.
* Lucius Manlius L. f. L. n. Fulvianus, the natural son of Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, was adopted by Lucius Manlius Acidinus, the praetor of 210 BC. Fulvianus was praetor in Hispania Citerior in 188 BC, proconsul in Spain from 187 to 185, an ambassador to the Gauls, and one of the triumvirs appointed to establish a colony at Aquileia in 183, and finally consul in 179, with his natural brother, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus.

* Manlius Acidinus, an acquaintance of the younger Cicero in 45 BC.

===Others===
* Marcus Manlius Tullus, according to Livy, consul in 500 BC; evidently an error for Manius Tullius Longus.
* Publius Manlius, &quot;epulo&quot; in 196 BC, praetor in Hither Spain in 195. He was possibly expelled from the Senate by Cato the Censor for having kissed his wife in front of his daughter. Reintegrated as praetor in 182, he was sent to Farther Spain, where he stayed as promagistrate for two years. He died in 180 at his return from Spain.
* Aulus Manlius Q. f., &quot;triumvir monetalis&quot; between 118 and 107 BC, and legate of Gaius Marius in 107, during the war against Jugurtha. He was one of the envoys sent to obtain Jugurtha&#x27;s surrender. From the inscriptions on his coins, Münzer supposes that he bore the cognomen &quot;Sergianus&quot;.
* Titus Manlius Mancinus, &quot;triumvir monetalis&quot; between 111 and 110 BC and tribune of the plebs in 107.
* Aulus Manlius A. f. Q. n., quaestor in 80 BC. He minted gold coins during his magistracy, which shows he was a supporter of Sulla.
* Lucius Manlius, possibly praetor in 79 BC, and proconsul in Transalpine Gaul in 78. He was defeated in Spain by Lucius Hirtuleius, Sertorius&#x27; legate.
* Quintus Manlius A. f. Q. n., &quot;triumvir capitalis&quot; circa 77 BC, and tribune of the plebs in 69.

* Gnaeus Manlius, tribune of the plebs in 58 BC, proposed a law granting the &quot;libertini&quot; the right to vote as members of any tribe. The law was blocked by the praetor Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. Manlius is sometimes confused with Gaius Manilius, who proposed a similar law in 66 BC.
* Titus Manlius T. f., may have been a legate in Spain between 45 and 42 BC, as he is named on a coin of Brutobriga. From the inscription, Münzer supposes that his cognomen was &quot;Sergianus&quot;.
* Quintus Manlius Ancharius Tarquitius Saturninus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 62, and proconsul of Africa in 72 and 73.
* Titus Manlius Valens, consul in AD 96, died the same year.

<text>A ministry of finance is a ministry or other government agency in charge of government finance, fiscal policy, and financial regulation. It is headed by a finance minister, an executive or cabinet position .

A ministry of finance&#x27;s portfolio has a large variety of names around the world, such as &quot;treasury&quot;, &quot;finance&quot;, &quot;financial affairs&quot;, &quot;economy&quot; or &quot;economic affairs&quot;. The position of the finance minister might be named for this portfolio, but it may also have some other name, like &quot;Treasurer&quot; or, in the United Kingdom, &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot;.

The duties of a finance minister differ between countries. Typically, they encompass one or more of government finances, economic policy and/or financial regulation, but there are significant differences between countries: 
* in some countries the finance minister might also have oversight of monetary policy (while in other countries that is the responsibility of an independent central bank); 
* in some countries the finance minister might be assisted by one or more other ministers (some supported by a separate government department) with respect to fiscal policy or budget formation; 
* in many countries there is a separate portfolio for general economic policy in the form of a ministry of &quot;economic affairs&quot; or &quot;national economy&quot; or &quot;commerce&quot;; 
* in many countries financial regulation is handled by a separate agency, which might be overseen by the finance ministry or some other government body.

Finance ministers are also often found in governments of federated states or provinces of a federal country. In these cases their powers may be substantially limited by superior legislative or fiscal policy, notably the control of taxation, spending, currency, inter-bank interest rates and the money supply.

The powers of a finance minister vary between governments. In the United States, the finance minister is called the &quot;Secretary of the Treasury&quot;, though there is a separate and subordinate Treasurer of the United States, and it is the director of the Office of Management and Budget who drafts the budget.

In the United Kingdom, the equivalent of the finance minister is the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Due to a quirk of history, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is also styled Second Lord of the Treasury with the Prime Minister also holding the historic position of First Lord of the Treasury. This signals the Prime Minister&#x27;s seniority and superior responsibility over the Treasury.

In Australia, the senior minister is the Treasurer, although there is a Minister for Finance who is more junior and, , heads a separate portfolio of Finance and the Public Service.

Finance ministers can be unpopular if they must raise taxes or cut spending. Finance ministers whose key decisions had directly benefited both the performance and perception of their country&#x27;s economic and financial achievements are recognised by the annual Euromoney Finance Minister of the Year award.

<text>Flight training is a course of study used when learning to pilot an aircraft. The overall purpose of primary and intermediate flight training is the acquisition and honing of basic airmanship skills.

Flight training can be conducted under a structured accredited syllabus with a flight instructor at a flight school or as private lessons with no syllabus with a flight instructor as long as all experience requirements for the desired pilot certificate/license are met.

Typically flight training consists of a combination of two parts: 
* &quot;Flight Lessons&quot; given in the aircraft or in a certified Flight Training Device.
* &quot;Ground School&quot; primarily given as a classroom lecture or lesson by a flight instructor where aeronautical theory is learned in preparation for the student&#x27;s written, oral, and flight pilot certification/licensing examinations.

Although there are various types of aircraft, many of the principles of piloting them have common techniques, especially those aircraft which are heavier-than-air types.

Flight schools commonly rent aircraft to students and licensed pilots at an hourly rate. Typically, the hourly rate is determined by the aircraft&#x27;s Hobbs meter or Tach timer, therefore the student is only charged while the aircraft engine is running. Flight instructors can also be scheduled with or without an aircraft for pilot proficiency and recurring training.

The oldest flight training school still in existence is the Royal Air Force&#x27;s (RAF&#x27;s) Central Flying School formed in May 1912 at Upavon, United Kingdom. The oldest civil flight school still active in the world is based in Germany at the Wasserkuppe. It was founded as &quot;Mertens Fliegerschule&quot;, and is currently named &quot;Fliegerschule Wasserkuppe&quot;.

==Licences==
The International Civil Aviation Organization sets global standards for Pilot licensing that are implemented and enforced by a country&#x27;s Civil aviation authority. Pilots must first meet their country&#x27;s requirements to obtain a Student pilot certificate which is used for training towards a Private Pilot Licence (PPL). They can then progress to a Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), and finally an Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL).

Some countries have a Light Aircraft Pilot Licence (LAPL), but this cannot be used internationally.

Separate licences are required for different aircraft categories, for example helicopters and aeroplanes.

==Ratings==
A type rating, also known as an endorsement, is the process undertaken by a pilot to update their license to allow them to fly a different type of aircraft. A class rating covers multiple aircraft.

An instrument rating allows a pilot to fly under instrument flight rules (IFR). A night rating allows a pilot to fly at night (that is, outside of Civil twilight).

<text>Melvin Ellis Calvin (April 8, 1911 – January 8, 1997) was an American biochemist known for discovering the Calvin cycle along with Andrew Benson and James Bassham, for which he was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He spent most of his five-decade career at the University of California, Berkeley.

== Early life and education ==
Melvin Calvin was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, the son of Elias Calvin and Rose Herwitz, Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire (now known as Lithuania and Georgia).

At an early age, Melvin Calvin’s family moved to Detroit, MI where his parents ran a grocery store to earn their living. Melvin Calvin was often found exploring his curiosity by looking through all of the products that made up their shelves. 

After he graduated from Central High School in 1928, he went on to study at Michigan College of Mining and Technology (now known as Michigan Technological University) where he received the school’s first Bachelors of Science in Chemistry. He went on to earn his Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota in 1935. While under the mentorship of George Glocker, he studied and wrote his thesis on the electron affinity of halogens. He was invited to join the lab of Michael Polanyi as a Post Doctoral student at the University of Manchester. The two years he spent at the lab were focused on studying the structure and behavior of organic molecules. In 1942, He married Marie Genevieve Jemtegaard, and they had three daughters, Elin, Sowie, and Karole, and a son, Noel.

== Career ==
On a visit to the University of Manchester, Joel Hildebrand, the director of UC Radiation Laboratory, invited Calvin to join the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. This made him the first non-Berkeley graduate hired by the chemistry department in +25 years. He invited Calvin to push forward in radioactive carbon research because &quot;now was the time&quot;. Calvin&#x27;s original research at UC Berkeley was based on the discoveries of Martin Kamen and Sam Ruben in long-lived radioactive carbon-14 in 1940.

In 1947, he was promoted to a Professor of Chemistry and the director of the Bio-Organic Chemistry group in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. The team he formed included: Andrew Benson, James A. Bassham, and several others. Andrew Benson was tasked with setting up the photosynthesis laboratory. The purpose of this lab was to discover the path of carbon fixation through the process of photosynthesis. The greatest impact of the research was discovering the way that light energy converts into chemical energy. Using the carbon-14 isotope as a tracer, Calvin, Andrew Benson and James Bassham mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis, starting from its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds. The process is part of the photosynthesis cycle. It was given the name the Calvin–Benson–Bassham Cycle, named for the work of Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson, and James Bassham. There were many people who contributed to this discovery but ultimately Melvin Calvin led the charge (see below).

In 1963, Calvin was given the additional title of Professor of Molecular Biology. He was founder and Director of the Laboratory of Chemical Biodynamics, known as the “Roundhouse”, and simultaneously Associate Director of Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, where he conducted much of his research until his retirement in 1980. In his final years of active research, he studied the use of oil-producing plants as renewable sources of energy. He also spent many years testing the chemical evolution of life and wrote a book on the subject that was published in 1969.

== The foundation of the Melvin Calvin laboratory ==
The circular laboratory known as the “Roundhouse”  was designed to facilitate collaboration between students and visiting scientists in Calvin’s lab. It was created as Calvin had an insatiable curiosity that drove him to become well versed in many fields and recognize the benefits of cross disciplinary collaboration. Open scientific discussion was a large part of his students&#x27; everyday lives and he wanted to create a community space where all kinds of minds and knowledge were brought together. In order to help facilitate this in the Roundhouse, he brought in post doctoral students and guest scientists from all around the world.

Calvin established a community within the roundhouse where students and staff members felt they could truly realize their potential. His management skills became renowned and many creative scientific outlets are modeled after them today. He was known as Mr. Photosynthesis but that does not even begin to describe how his organizational and management skills revolutionized the scientific community across all fronts.

== Discovery of the Calvin cycle ==
The discovery of the Calvin cycle would start by building on the research done by Sam Ruben and Martin Kamen after their work on the carbon-14 isotope came to an end after Ruben’s accidental death in the laboratory and Kamen found himself in trouble over security breaches with the FBI and Department of State. Despite this Ernest Lawrence, the Radiation Laboratory director, was proud of the work they had done and wanted to see the research furthered so he along with Wendell Latimer, the Dean of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, recruited Calvin in 1945.

The lab&#x27;s original focus was on the applications of Carbon-14 in medicine and synthesis of radio-labeled amino acids and biological metabolites for medical research. Calvin began to establish the lab by recruiting strong chemists in labs across the country. He then recruited Andrew Benson, who had worked with Ruben and Kamen previously on photosynthesis and C-14, to head that aspect of the lab.

The predominating theory regarding the production of sugars and other reduced carbon compounds was that they were considered to be a “light” reaction. This theory had yet to be disproven. Benson began his investigation by continuing his previous work with the isolation of the product of dark CO2 fixation and would then crystalize the radioactive succinic acid. This paired with exposing algae to light without CO2 and then immediately transferring it to a dark flask that contained CO2 and observing that the radioactive sucrose was still formed at the same rate as when photosynthesis was allowed to be carried out in pure light gave definitive evidence that there was a non-photochemical reduction of CO2.

There was an issue though, they now needed to determine the first product of the fixation of CO2. In order to do this, they began utilizing paper chromatographic techniques that were pioneered by W.A Stepka. This allowed them to determine that the first product of CO2 fixation was 3-Carbon phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). A long known product of glucose fermentation per the reaction outlined years earlier by Ruben and Kamen.

After this discovery, Calvin’s competing lab at the University of Chicago was unable to confirm the discovery and thus created a strong attack on Calvin’s literature. This led to a symposium sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science to determine which lab was correct. Though met with resistance at the conference Calvin and Benson were able to convince the audience of their position and the attack was dismissed.

After this first identification the remaining members of the glycolytic sequence save for two were able to be identified based on their chemical behavior. The two unknown components were sugars. Benson, after noticing their separation on the paper chromatograms and examining their reactivities, realized they were ketoses. Thanks to the collaboration of James A. Bassham the compounds were able to be subjected to periodate degradation. The identification of 14% activity in the carbonyl carbon in one of the sugars made Bassham turn his attention to seven-carbon sugars. Despite several more tests though, Bassham was unable to determine the identities of these two sugars.

Further experimentation showed that through restricting the uptake of CO2 the level of ribulose bisphosphate could be increased. This was an indication that it was the acceptor molecule for CO2. Though the mechanism for this was not immediately obvious, Calvin was able to determine one later called the novel carboxylation mechanism which would lead to the series completion in 1958.

== Public service ==
Throughout his life, Calvin acted as a public servant in many different capacities. He served as president of the American Chemical Society, the American Society of Plant Physiology, and the Pacific Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Along with all of this he also served as chairman of the Committee on Science and Public Policy for the National Academy of Sciences.

One major contribution he had as a public servant was his work with NASA. In collaboration with NASA, he assisted in the creation of plans to protect the Moon against biological contamination from the Earth and the Earth from contamination from the Moon during the Apollo missions. As well as, helping strategies on how to best bring back lunar samples and how to search for biological life on other planets.

Along with these servant capacities he also worked as a public servant for the U.S government. He served as a member of the President’s Science Advisory Committee from 1963 to 1966 and served on the top advisory body of the Department of Energy, the Energy Research Advisory Board.

Finally, he served on many international committees and for many international organizations including the Joint Commission on Applied Radioactivity of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the U.S. Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry, and the Commission on Molecular Biophysics of the International Organization for Pure and Applied Biophysics

== Controversy ==
In his 2011 television history of Botany for the BBC, Timothy Walker, Director of the University of Oxford Botanic Garden, criticised Calvin&#x27;s treatment of Andrew Benson, claiming that Calvin had got the credit for Benson&#x27;s work after firing him, and had failed to mention Benson&#x27;s role when writing his autobiography decades later. Benson himself has also mentioned being fired by Calvin, and has complained about not being mentioned in his autobiography.

<doc id="354576" wikidata="Q26621" url="?curid=354576" title="Matt Hardy">
<text>Matthew Moore Hardy (born September 23, 1974) is an American professional wrestler and actor. He is signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he is one-half of the reigning TNA World Tag Team Champions in his third reign. He also appears in partner promotion WWE, on its NXT brand. He is also known for his tenures in WWE and All Elite Wrestling (AEW).

With his brother Jeff, Hardy gained prominence in WWF&#x27;s tag team division during the 2000s due to his participation in TLC matches. He is a 15-time world tag team champion, having held the WWE World Tag Team Championship six times, the WWE Raw Tag Team Championship three times, the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship, ROH World Tag Team Championship, and WCW Tag Team Championship once each, and the TNA World Tag Team Championships three times. They are considered one of the major teams that revived tag team wrestling during the Attitude Era.

Wrestling through four separate decades, Hardy has kept himself relevant partially through a variety of different gimmicks and his use of social media. In 2002, Hardy began a solo career in WWE. His subsequent &quot;Version 1&quot; persona was named Best Gimmick by the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;. Hardy&#x27;s eccentric &quot;Broken&quot; gimmick, which he debuted in 2016 (and which was renamed &quot;Woken&quot; following his subsequent WWE return), garnered praise from wrestling critics and earned him multiple awards, including a second Best Gimmick award, becoming one of the most talked about characters in all of wrestling. As a singles wrestler, Hardy has won the WWE United States, Hardcore, European, and Cruiserweight championships as well as three world championships (one ECW Championship and two TNA World Heavyweight Championships).

== Early life ==
Hardy was born in Cameron, North Carolina, the son of Gilbert and Ruby Moore Hardy. He is the older brother of Jeff Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1987. Hardy played baseball as a child and throughout high school, but had stopped by his senior year. He also played football, either as a linebacker or a defensive end. Hardy was a good student at Union Pines High School in North Carolina, and was a nominee for the Morehead Scholarship, a scholarship to any university in North Carolina. Hardy attended University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he majored in engineering; after a year, however, he dropped out due to his father being ill. He then attended Sandhills Community College in Pinehurst to gain his associate degree.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1992–1999) ===

Hardy, along with his brother Jeff and friends, started their own federation, the Trampoline Wrestling Federation (TWF) and mimicked the moves they saw on television. Shortly after Hardy sent in a tape for the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) Amateur Challenge using the ring name High Voltage, a tag team named High Voltage began competing in WCW, causing Hardy to change his name to Surge. A few years later, it was revealed to him by Chris Kanyon that the tape had been kept in the WCW Power Plant, watched multiple times, and that the name High Voltage was blatantly stolen from it. Beginning in 1994, The Hardys wrestled for several North Carolina–based independent circuit promotions and adapted a number of alter-egos. As The Wolverine, Hardy captured the New England Wrestling Alliance (NEWA) Championship in May 1994. As High Voltage, he teamed with Venom to claim the New Frontier Wrestling Association (NFWA) Tag Team Championship in March 1995. A month later, High Voltage defeated the Willow for the NFWA Championship.

In 1997, Matt and Jeff created their own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently abbreviated to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. Both Matt and Jeff took apart the ring and put it back together at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion folded in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1994–2005) ===
==== Early years (1994–1998) ====
Hardy worked as a jobber for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1994 up until he signed a full-time contract in 1998. His first WWF match was against Nikolai Volkoff on the May 23, 1994, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, which he lost by submission. A night later at a taping of &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot;, he lost a match against Owen Hart. He continued to wrestle sporadically in the WWF throughout 1994 and 1995, losing matches against Crush, Irwin R. Schyster, Razor Ramon, Hakushi, Owen Hart, the imposter Undertaker, Hunter Hearst Helmsley and &quot;The Ringmaster&quot; Steve Austin.

Hardy teamed with Jeff for the first time in the WWF in 1996, losing to teams such as The Smoking Gunns and The Grimm Twins on WWF television. Matt and Jeff had matches with The Headbangers (Thrasher and Mosh) twice, and Kurrgan twice in 1997. It was during this time that Matt and Jeff experimented with different ring names, at one stage being called Ingus (Matt) and Wildo Jinx (Jeff). In Matt&#x27;s final singles match for the promotion before signing a full-time contract he lost to Val Venis on a taping of &quot;Shotgun&quot; in May 1998.

==== The Hardy Boyz (1998–2001) ====

It was not until 1998, however, (at the height of The Attitude Era) that the Hardy brothers were given full-time WWF contracts and sent to train with former wrestler Dory Funk Jr. The Hardy Boyz used a cruiserweight, fast-paced high flying style in their matches, often leaping from great heights to do damage to their opponents (and themselves in the process). In 1999, while feuding with Edge and Christian, the duo briefly picked up Michael Hayes as a manager.

At King of the Ring on June 27, The Hardyz defeated Edge and Christian to earn the #1 contendership for the WWF Tag Team Championship. On the July 5 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, they defeated The Acolytes to win their first Tag Team Championship. They soon dumped Hayes and briefly picked up Gangrel as a manager, after Gangrel turned on Edge and Christian. At No Mercy on October 17, The Hardyz defeated Edge and Christian in the first ever tag team ladder match. At the Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Hardyz defeated The Dudley Boyz in the first ever tag team tables match. They competed against The Dudley Boyz and Edge and Christian for the WWF Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2 in the first ever Triangle Ladder match, but were unsuccessful.
Hardy won the Hardcore Championship on the April 24 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, by defeating Crash Holly, but lost it back to Holly three days later on &quot;SmackDown!,&quot; when Holly applied the &quot;24/7 rule&quot; during Hardy&#x27;s title defense against Jeff. The Hardy Boyz then found a new manager in Matt&#x27;s real-life girlfriend Lita. Together, the three became known as &quot;Team Xtreme&quot;.

At SummerSlam on August 27, The Hardy Boyz competed in the first ever Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, for the WWF Tag Team Championship against The Dudley Boyz and Edge and Christian, but were unsuccessful. At Unforgiven on September 24, The Hardy Boyz defeated Edge and Christian in a steel cage match to win the tag team championship, and retained it the following night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; against Edge and Christian in a ladder match.

In April 2001, The Hardy Boyz began feuding with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H (known as The Power Trip), which also led to a singles push for both Matt and Jeff. Hardy helped Jeff defeat Triple H for the Intercontinental Championship on the April 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, and shortly after Hardy defeated Eddie Guerrero to win the European Championship on the April 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. At Backlash on April 29 Hardy retained the title against Guerrero and Christian in a triple threat, and against Edge the following night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;.

Throughout the year, the Hardy Boyz continued to win as a tag team, winning the WWF Tag Team Titles two more times, and the WCW Tag Team Championship during the Invasion. By the end of the year, the Hardy Boyz began a storyline where they were having trouble co-existing. This culminated in a match between the two, with Lita as the guest referee, at Vengeance on December 9, which Jeff won. Hardy defeated Jeff and Lita the following night on &quot;Raw&quot; in a two-on-one handicap match.

==== Version 1 gimmick and feud with Kane (2002–2004) ====
At the beginning of 2002, it seemed Team Xtreme had patched things up. After the brand extension (where the Hardy Boyz were drafted to the Raw brand), however, Matt was relegated to &quot;Heat&quot; while Jeff wrestled on the main show, &quot;Raw&quot;. On the August 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy turned heel by attacking Jeff during Jeff&#x27;s match against Rob Van Dam, because Hardy was frustrated at not receiving a match against Van Dam for the number one contendership for the Intercontinental Championship. A short time later, Hardy joined the SmackDown! brand, and began dubbing himself &quot;Matt Hardy: Version 1&quot;, complete with a &quot;version 1&quot; hand signal. Hardy defeated The Undertaker on the September 12 and October 3 episodes of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, due to interference from Brock Lesnar.
Along with his Mattitude Follower Shannon Moore in his corner, 2003 began with Hardy frantically trying to lose weight to get under the weight limit to compete for the Cruiserweight Championship. After just barely making weight, Hardy defeated Billy Kidman at No Way Out on February 23 to win the Cruiserweight Championship. At WrestleMania XIX on March 30, he successfully defended it against Rey Mysterio. Hardy lost the Cruiserweight Championship to Mysterio in the main event of the June 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; - the first and only time a Cruiserweight Championship match main evented a show.

After dropping the Cruiserweight Championship, Hardy briefly feuded with Eddie Guerrero, but was unsuccessful in capturing Guerrero&#x27;s United States Championship or WWE Tag Team Championship. The Mattitude faction then expanded to include Crash Holly as Moore&#x27;s &quot;Moore-on&quot; (apprentice). He later disbanded the group in November and returned to the Raw brand in order to be able to travel and work with his then girlfriend Lita, who just returned from an injury. On his first night back, he turned on Lita in storyline after teasing a proposal to her. He defeated Christian, who was vying for Lita&#x27;s affections, on the following edition of &quot;Raw&quot;.

In April 2004, Hardy saved Lita from getting attacked by Kane, turning face in the process. Hardy defeated Kane in a no disqualification match at Vengeance on July 11, but lost a &quot;Till Death To Us Part&quot; match against Kane at SummerSlam on August 15, resulting in Lita being forced to marry Kane. On the August 23 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; Hardy was chokeslamed off the stage by Kane during the wedding. Hardy then spent almost a year off from wrestling due to a severe knee injury.

==== Departure and sporadic appearances (2005)====
Along with his friend Rhyno, Hardy was released by WWE on April 11, 2005. Hardy&#x27;s release was largely due to unprofessional conduct on social media after discovering that Lita was having a real-life affair with his best friend Edge. The public knowledge of the affair and Hardy&#x27;s release led to Edge and Lita receiving jeers from the crowds at WWE events, often resulting in chants of &quot;You screwed Matt!&quot;, and, &quot;We want Matt!&quot;, which meant kayfabe storylines were being affected, considering that Lita was married to Kane at the time in kayfabe. Edge and Lita used the affair and fan backlash to become a hated on-screen couple, which led to Lita turning heel for the first time in over five years.

Fans began a petition on the internet, wanting WWE to re-sign Hardy, and amassed over 15,000 signatures. Hardy released two character promotional vignettes, that he was planning to use before he was offered a new contract. He called himself The Angelic Diablo with the tagline &quot;the scar will become a symbol&quot; in reference to the way in which he had been treated by Amy and Adam. On the June 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, during the storyline wedding of Edge and Lita, Hardy&#x27;s entrance music and video were played when the priest asked if anyone had a reason why Edge and Lita should not be wed.

=== Independent circuit and Ring of Honor (2005) ===
Following his WWE release, Matt returned to the independent circuit and wrestled several matches for the Allied Powers Wrestling Federation (APWF), International Wrestling Cartel (IWC) and Big Time Wrestling (BTW).

Hardy appeared at a scheduled Ring of Honor (ROH) event on July 16, 2005, in Woodbridge, Connecticut, where he defeated Christopher Daniels via submission. Hardy also cut a brief worked shoot promo where he criticized WWE and John Laurinaitis. Following his official return to WWE, Hardy was met with backlash following a match with Homicide from the fans at a subsequent ROH event, which Hardy won. The next day at his final ROH appearance, he lost to Roderick Strong.

=== Return to WWE (2005–2010) ===
==== Feud with Edge (2005–2006) ====

On July 11, 2005, on &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy attacked Edge backstage and again later during Edge&#x27;s match with Kane. Before being escorted out of the building by security, Hardy stated that Edge (calling him by his real name of &quot;Adam&quot;) and Lita would pay for their actions and told fans that they could see him at Ring of Honor while security officials and event staff were trying to restrain him. Hardy also called out Johnny Ace as security had him in handcuffs taking him out of the arena. This caused an uproar amongst fans, who were confused and wondered if the whole thing was a work or a shoot. Similar occurrences repeated during the following two weeks.

On the August 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince McMahon officially announced Hardy&#x27;s return to WWE, adding that Hardy would face Edge at SummerSlam on August 21. Hardy made his in-ring return, defeating Snitsky on the August 8 &quot;Raw&quot;. Seconds after the victory, Hardy was attacked by Edge, and as he was being carried backstage, Matt counterattacked Edge in the locker room. At SummerSlam, their match came to a premature end when Edge dropped Hardy onto the top of a ring post, causing him to bleed heavily. The referee ended the match on the grounds that Hardy could not continue, and Edge was declared the winner. After SummerSlam, the two continued their feud, including a Street Fight on the August 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; that resulted in Hardy performing a Side Effect on Edge off the entrance stage and into electrical equipment below; the match ended in a no contest. At Unforgiven on September 18, Edge faced Hardy in a steel cage match. Hardy caught an interfering Lita with the Twist of Fate and won the match with a leg drop off the top of the cage. Hardy and Edge faced each other on October 3 at &quot;WWE Raw Homecoming&quot; in a Loser Leaves Raw ladder match. Edge&#x27;s briefcase holding his Money in the Bank contract for his WWE Championship opportunity was suspended above the ring. The winner of the match received the contract and the loser was forced to leave &quot;Raw&quot;. Edge tied Hardy&#x27;s arms in the ropes, and Lita trapped Hardy in a crucifix hold, leaving Hardy only able to watch Edge win.
With his defeat at the hands of Edge, Hardy was moved to the SmackDown! brand where he re-debuted with a win over Simon Dean on the October 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in Reno, Nevada. One week later, Hardy won the fan vote to represent Team SmackDown! (alongside Rey Mysterio) to challenge Team Raw (Edge and Chris Masters) at Taboo Tuesday on November 1. Edge, however, refused to wrestle and sent Snitsky in place of him in the match, which Hardy and Mysterio won.

Back on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in 2006, Hardy started an angle with MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury) and their manager Melina when Melina approached Hardy, seemingly wanting Hardy to join with her team. Hardy refused the offer, which led to him facing the tag team on several occasions with a variety of partners. On July 25, after the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; taping, Hardy was taken out of action after doctors found the remnants of the staph infection that had plagued him the previous year. He was sidelined until August 25 while he healed.

Upon his return to action, Hardy feuded against childhood friend and reigning Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms. At No Mercy on October 8, in their home state, Hardy beat Helms in a non-title match. The two met again at Survivor Series on November 26, where Hardy&#x27;s team won in a clean sweep. They wrestled one final match, a one time appearance in Booker T&#x27;s Pro Wrestling Alliance (PWA) promotion, where Hardy defeated Helms in a North Carolina Street Fight.

==== The Hardy Boyz reunion (2006–2007) ====

On the November 21 episode of &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot;, Hardy and Jeff competed in a match together for the first time in almost five years, defeating The Full Blooded Italians. At December to Dismember on December 3, the Hardy Boyz issued an open challenge to any tag team who wanted to face them. MNM answered their challenge by reuniting at December to Dismember, a match won by the Hardy Boyz. At Armageddon on December 17, Hardy and Jeff competed against Paul London and Brian Kendrick, MNM, and Dave Taylor and William Regal in a Ladder match for the WWE Tag Team Championship but lost. Subsequently, he and Jeff feuded with MNM after the legitimate incident where they injured Mercury&#x27;s face at Armageddon. This led to a long term rivalry, and at the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2007, Hardy and Jeff defeated MNM. Mercury and Hardy continued to feud on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; until Mercury was released from WWE on March 26.
On the April 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Hardys competed in a 10-team battle royal for the World Tag Team Championship. They won the titles for the sixth time from then WWE Champion John Cena and Shawn Michaels after last eliminating Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch. This started a feud with Cade and Murdoch, and the Hardys successfully retained their World Tag Team Championship in their first title defense at Backlash on April 29. The Hardy Boyz also retained their titles at Judgment Day on May 20 against Cade and Murdoch. One month later at One Night Stand on June 3, they defeated The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team to retain the titles in a Ladder match. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince McMahon demanded that The Hardys once again defend their championships against Cade and Murdoch. The Hardys were defeated after Murdoch pushed Jeff&#x27;s foot off the bottom rope during Cade&#x27;s pinfall, causing the three count to continue. They invoked their rematch clause against Cade and Murdoch at on June 24, but were unsuccessful.

==== Feud with MVP and championship reigns (2007–2009) ====
On the July 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Hardy won a non-title match against United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), which resulted in a feud between the two. Hardy was defeated by MVP at The Great American Bash on July 22 for the United States Championship. MVP then claimed that he was &quot;better than Hardy at everything&quot;, which led to a series of contests between Hardy and MVP, such as a basketball game, an arm wrestling contest, and a chess match which MVP &quot;sneezed&quot; on and ruined when Hardy put him in check. MVP challenged Hardy to a boxing match on the August 18 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;, however MVP was legitimately diagnosed with the heart condition Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Since MVP was unable to compete, Hardy faced his replacement, former world champion boxer, Evander Holyfield. The match ended in a no contest after MVP entered the ring to verbally abuse Holyfield, who then knocked him out. MVP also challenged Hardy to a beer drinking contest at SummerSlam on August 26, but as revenge for what happened on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;, Hardy allowed Stone Cold Steve Austin to replace him; Austin simply performed a stunner on MVP then kept drinking.

After a segment involving MVP inadvertently choosing Hardy as his tag-team partner, Theodore Long promptly set up a match against Deuce &#x27;n Domino for the WWE Tag Team Championship on the August 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; which Hardy and MVP were able to win, therefore setting up Hardy&#x27;s first reign as WWE Tag Team Champion. Hardy and MVP retained the titles at Unforgiven on September 16 in a rematch against former champions Deuce &#x27;n Domino. Hardy was scheduled to face MVP at Cyber Sunday on October 28, but due to a real-life head injury sustained on the October 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he was not medically cleared to compete. As part of the storyline, Hardy continually asked MVP for a shot at the United States Championship but MVP refused stating that he was more focused on the Tag Team Championship.

On the November 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Hardy and MVP dropped the WWE Tag Team Championship to John Morrison and The Miz. Despite the fact that Hardy was hurt, MVP immediately invoked the rematch clause. After the rematch, in which Hardy was forced to tap out, MVP attacked Hardy, repeatedly targeting his knee. It was later confirmed by WWE.com that Hardy had suffered an injury at MVP&#x27;s hands and that he might not be able to compete at Survivor Series on November 18. Despite Hardy&#x27;s absence at Survivor Series, his team was able to win the match. On November 21, WWE&#x27;s official website reported that Hardy underwent an emergency appendectomy in Tampa, Florida, after his appendix burst. Hardy made an appearance at the December 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; supporting his brother Jeff. To further Jeff&#x27;s storyline with Randy Orton, however, Hardy was attacked by Orton. Hardy made his return at a live event in Muncie, Indiana, on March 1, 2008.
On March 30 at WrestleMania XXIV, during the Money in the Bank ladder match Hardy cut through the crowd and attacked MVP to prevent him from winning the match. He made his official in-ring return the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, losing a singles match to WWE Champion Randy Orton. On the April 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Hardy faced MVP in a non-title match, which he won, re-igniting their storyline rivalry. Hardy defeated MVP to win the United States Championship at Backlash on April 27, and retained his title against MVP five days later on &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

Hardy declared himself as a fighting champion that would take on all challenges, defending the United States championship against Shelton Benjamin, Elijah Burke, Chuck Palumbo, Mr. Kennedy, Chavo Guerrero and Umaga. Hardy was drafted to the ECW brand on the June 23, 2008, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; during the 2008 WWE Draft, in the process making the United States Championship exclusive to ECW. He lost the United States Championship to Shelton Benjamin at the Great American Bash pay-per-view on July 20, which meant that the title returned to SmackDown. 

On the July 22 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Hardy became the number one contender to Mark Henry&#x27;s ECW Championship after defeating John Morrison, The Miz and Finlay in a fatal four-way match. He won the title match at SummerSlam on August 17 by disqualification due to interference from Henry&#x27;s manager, Tony Atlas, thus he failed to win the title. Due to the ending of the SummerSlam match, Hardy received a rematch for the title on the next episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, but again failed to win the title when Henry pinned him after a distraction by Atlas. At Unforgiven on September 7, Hardy won the ECW Championship during the Championship scramble match, defeating then-champion Henry, The Miz, Finlay and Chavo Guerrero Jr. by pinning the Miz with three minutes left, marking his first world heavyweight championship win. He continued to feud with Henry until No Mercy on October 5, where Hardy retained the title. Hardy lost the title to Jack Swagger on the January 13, 2009, episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, which was taped on January 12.

==== Feud with Jeff Hardy and departure (2009–2010) ====
At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view on January 25, after losing an ECW Championship rematch to Swagger, Hardy turned on his brother when he hit Jeff with a steel chair, allowing Edge to win the WWE Championship, turning heel for the first time since 2004. On the January 27 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, it was announced by General Manager Theodore Long that Hardy had requested, and been granted, his release from ECW and had re-signed with the SmackDown brand. As part of the buildup to this feud, Matt strongly implied that he was responsible for all of Jeff&#x27;s accidents leading back to November, including an assault in a hotel stairwell that prevented Jeff from appearing at Survivor Series, an automobile accident where Jeff&#x27;s car was run off the road, and a pyrotechnics malfunction where part of the pyro from Jeff&#x27;s entrance was fired directly at Jeff, in an attempt to stop Jeff holding the WWE Championship. Despite Hardy&#x27;s attempts to goad Jeff into fighting him, Jeff refused to fight his brother, but, on the March 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Jeff attacked him during a promo where Matt implied that he was also responsible for the fire that burned down Jeff&#x27;s house, going so far as to reveal that he had in his possession a dog collar that supposedly belonged to Jeff&#x27;s dog, Jack (who died in the fire), that he claimed to have salvaged from the wreckage of the house. At WrestleMania 25 on April 5, Matt defeated Jeff in an Extreme Rules match, and in a stretcher match on the following episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;.
On the April 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the WWE draft. Despite the fact that the two were on different brands, he continued his feud with Jeff. Two weeks later, in a rematch from WrestleMania, Hardy lost to Jeff in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Backlash on April 26, in which he legitimately broke his hand.

Hardy continued to wrestle with his hand in a cast, incorporating it into his persona and claiming that he was wrestling under protest. He reignited his feud with MVP on Raw for the United States Championship. He also formed a tag team with William Regal, and the two acted as henchmen for General Manager Vickie Guerrero. At the June 22 taping of &quot;WWE Superstars&quot;, Hardy suffered yet another injury, when his intestines went through his abdominal wall, during a triple threat match against MVP and Kofi Kingston. Hardy had suffered a tear in his abdominal muscle two years previously, but had not needed surgery until it worsened, and became a danger to his health.

He was then traded back to the SmackDown brand on June 29, and underwent surgery for the torn abdominal muscle on July 2. He made his return on the August 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; as the special guest referee in the World Heavyweight Championship match between his brother, Jeff, and CM Punk, and helped Jeff retain the championship by counting the pinfall. The following week Hardy turned face again when he saved Jeff when CM Punk and The Hart Dynasty attacked both Jeff and John Morrison. On the August 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, after apologizing for his past actions towards Jeff and admitting that he was not behind any of Jeff&#x27;s accidents, he had his first match back after his injury when he teamed with Jeff and John Morrison to defeat The Hart Dynasty and CM Punk, when Matt pinned Punk.
In early 2010, Hardy began an on-screen relationship with Maria; but was brief and the relationship ended when Maria was released from her WWE contract. On the March 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Hardy qualified for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXVI on March 28 by defeating Drew McIntyre, but was unsuccessful at WrestleMania, as the match was won by Jack Swagger. Hardy was suspended by Vince McMahon because he attacked McIntyre after McIntyre lost to Kofi Kingston at Over the Limit on May 23. He was able to get his revenge on McIntyre during the Viewer&#x27;s Choice episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when chosen as the opponent for McIntyre, with General Manager Theodore Long stating that Hardy was suspended from &quot;SmackDown&quot;, but not from &quot;Raw&quot;. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, however, Vickie Guerrero announced that, per orders of Vince McMahon, Hardy had been suspended from all WWE programming. However, at Fatal 4-Way on June 20, Hardy prevented McIntyre from regaining the Intercontinental Championship, thus continuing their feud. On the following edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, he was reinstated by Long and had a match with McIntyre, which Hardy won. After the match, it was announced that McIntyre&#x27;s visa had legitimately expired and was sent back to Scotland, thus ending their feud. Hardy was featured in the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match at Money in the Bank on July 18 but was unsuccessful in winning with Kane coming out victorious.

On the September 10 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, he lost his last televised match against then-newcomer Alberto Del Rio and was saved by Christian (who was feuding with Del Rio) after the match. Two days later on September 12, WWE confirmed they had sent Hardy home from a European tour. Following this, Hardy began posting videos on his YouTube channel expressing his disinterest in the WWE product and insisting that he wanted to be released from the company. On October 15, 2010, WWE announced that Hardy had been released from his contract. Hardy later stated that his release had been in effect two weeks before WWE made the announcement.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2011) ===
On January 9, 2011, Hardy made his debut for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) at the Genesis pay-per-view, as part of the stable Immortal. He was the surprise opponent for Rob Van Dam, and defeated him to prevent Van Dam from receiving a match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, held by Hardy&#x27;s brother Jeff. In the main event, Hardy attempted to interfere in Jeff&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship match with Mr. Anderson, but was stopped by Van Dam, which led to Jeff losing both the match and the championship. On the January 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the Hardy Boyz reunited to defeat Anderson and Van Dam in a tag team match, following interference from Beer Money, Inc. On February 13 at Against All Odds, Van Dam defeated Hardy in a rematch.

On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hardy, along with the rest of Immortal and Ric Flair, betrayed Fortune. On March 13 at Victory Road, Hardy was defeated by Flair&#x27;s previous protégé, A.J. Styles. On April 17 at Lockdown, Immortal, represented by Hardy, Abyss, Bully Ray and Ric Flair, were defeated by Fortune members James Storm, Kazarian and Robert Roode and Christopher Daniels, who replaced an injured A.J. Styles, in a Lethal Lockdown match. On the April 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hardy faced Sting for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, Hardy&#x27;s first World Title match in TNA, but was defeated. The following month, Hardy was granted a shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship against Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode). While the champions looked to defend the title against the Hardy Boyz, Matt instead introduced the returning Chris Harris, Storm&#x27;s old tag team partner, as his partner for the title match. The match took place at Sacrifice, where Storm and Roode retained their titles.

On June 21, it was reported that TNA had suspended Hardy. On August 20, Hardy was released from TNA following a DUI arrest that occurred earlier that same day.

=== Return to the independent circuit (2011–2017) ===
Hardy announced his retirement from full-time professional wrestling due to injuries on September 1, 2011. He issued a challenge to his long-time rival MVP, who was wrestling in Japan at the time, to one final match at &quot;Crossfire Live!&quot; in Nashville. The event was held May 19, 2012, and benefited the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Hardy won the match.

On February 9, 2015, Hardy appeared on FWE&#x27;s &quot;No Limits 2015&quot; iPPV, challenging Drew Galloway for the ICW World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated. It was this ICW title match which saw the Scottish championship renamed as the ICW&#x27;s &quot;World Heavyweight Championship&quot; due to being the first defense outside of continent of Europe.

On November 28, 2015, Hardy lost the WrestleCade Championship to Jeff Jarrett at WrestleCade IV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Hardy regained the title in a triple-threat cage match against Jarrett and Ethan Carter III in Hickory, North Carolina on May 20, 2016.

On November 21, 2015, Matt won the OMEGA Heavyweight Championship for the second time, defeating former student Trevor Lee. Following this, Matt (upon regaining the TNA world title as part of his villainous egotistical &quot;Iconic&quot; gimmick) began proclaiming himself to be the only world champion that matters, and the only &quot;true&quot; world champion in wrestling, as he held both the TNA and OMEGA Championships, which (according to him) put him above any other promotions&#x27; world champions. Throughout 2016, Hardy defended the TNA and OMEGA titles jointly at OMEGA events as part of his &quot;only true world champion&quot; gimmick.

On January 29, The Hardys won the OMEGA Tag Team Championships.

=== Return to TNA (2014–2017) ===
==== The Hardys third reunion (2014–2015) ====

On July 24, 2014, Hardy returned to TNA and reunited with Jeff to reform The Hardys for the third time. At the &quot;Destination X&quot; episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, The Hardys were defeated by The Wolves in a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the August 14 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Team 3D (formerly the Dudley Boyz) challenged The Hardys to a match, which Team 3D won. At the Hardcore Justice episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, The Hardys and Team 3D talked about a match involving themselves and The Wolves. When The Wolves were asked by the two teams, they agreed. Later that night, Kurt Angle announced all three teams would compete in a best of three series for the TNA World Tag Team Championship with the winners of the first match choosing the stipulation of the next one. The Hardys won the second match of the series on the September 10 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; in a tables match and choose a ladder match for the third match of the series. The Hardys were unsuccessful in winning that match on the September 17 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, as the Wolves won that match. The Wolves then went on to pick the final match of the series to be a Full Metal Mayhem match to take place on the October 8 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. The Hardys were unsuccessful in that match as the Wolves won that match.

On October 22, The Hardys entered a number one contenders tournament for the TNA World Tag Team Championship defeating The BroMans (Jessie Godderz and DJ Z) in the first round of the tournament.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2015–2016)====
On June 28, 2015, Hardy was among the five wrestlers who competed for the TNA King of the Mountain Championship at Slammiversary, with Jeff Jarrett ultimately emerging victorious. On the July 8 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hardy requested a world title shot against Ethan Carter III, but was denied and forced to face the Dirty Heels (Austin Aries and Bobby Roode) in a handicap match, which he lost. On the July 22 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hardy defeated Roode in a Tables match to become the #1 contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the August 5 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hardy got his shot at the title against EC3 in a Full Metal Mayhem match, but failed to win the title. On the September 2 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hardy got another shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against EC3, but again failed to win the title; as part of the storyline, Jeff Hardy was forced to act as Ethan Carter&#x27;s personal assistant. On the September 30 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hardy was added to the Ethan Carter III vs. Drew Galloway main event match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory after he and Galloway defeated Carter and Tyrus, making it a three-way match, following which Jeff, who EC3 had just &quot;fired&quot; in the previous episode, was revealed to be the special guest referee.

On October 4 at Bound for Glory, Matt won the TNA World Heavyweight Championship by pinning Galloway. However, EC3 filed an injunction (kayfabe) that banned Hardy from appearing on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; for a month, which forced Hardy to relinquish the title in order to stay on the show. However, Hardy had been participating in the TNA World Title Series for the vacant title. He qualified to the round of 16 by defeating Davey Richards, Robbie E and Eddie Edwards. He then advanced to the round of 8 by defeating the King of the Mountain Champion Bobby Roode and then to Jessie Godderz to continue his winning streak. The semifinals and finals were held on the January 5, 2016, live episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; during its debut on Pop TV, in which he defeated Eric Young to advance to the final round. Hardy faced EC3 in the TNA World Title Series finals, but lost the match via pinfall.
Hardy won the TNA World Title from EC3 on the January 19, 2016, episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, becoming the first man to defeat him in a one-on-one match in TNA. During the match a double turn took place; Hardy turned heel after Tyrus betrayed EC3. The following week on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Jeff Hardy had confronted him about last week and issued a challenge to Matt for the World Heavyweight title in the main event and Matt accepted. However, later before the main event could begin, Eric Young and Bram attacked Jeff from behind. Kurt Angle then came out to try save Jeff, and Matt had Tyrus attack Angle from behind. While Matt watched from the ramp, Young attacked Jeff with the Piledriver off the apron through a table. The following week, he retained his title against Angle. At Lockdown, he retained his title in a Six-side of steel match against Ethan Carter III, with the help of Rockstar Spud. He lost his title against Drew Galloway on the March 15 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, after a match featuring EC3 and Jeff Hardy.

Two weeks later he received a rematch for the title on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, but was again defeated by Galloway. After losing the title he started a feud with Jeff. On the April 19 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, an I Quit match ended in a no-contest as both Matt and Jeff were badly injured and Matt was taken out to the hospital on a stretcher.

==== The Broken Universe (2016–2017) ====
Hardy returned on May 17 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, revealing himself to be one of the impostor Willows behind the attacks on Jeff. Later that night, he attacked Jeff. In the following weeks, Hardy debuted a new persona as a &quot;Broken&quot; man with part of his hair bleached blonde along with a strange sophisticated accent, blaming Jeff (who he began referring to as &quot;Brother Nero&quot;, Nero being Jeff&#x27;s middle name) for breaking him and becoming obsessed with &quot;deleting&quot; him. His line “Delete”, is mostly inspired by the &quot;Death Note&quot; manga/anime series character Teru Mikami. On June 12, at Slammiversary, Matt was defeated by Jeff in a Full Metal Mayhem match. On the June 21 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Matt was once again defeated by Jeff in a Six Sides of Steel match. On the June 28 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Matt challenged Jeff to a final battle with the Hardy brand on the line, to take place at their home in Cameron, North Carolina the next week. On July 5, during special episode &quot;The Final Deletion&quot;, Matt defeated Jeff in the match to become sole owner of the Hardy brand, forcing Jeff to drop his last name and become referred to as &quot;Brother Nero&quot;.

On the August 18 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Matt and Brother Nero defeated The Tribunal, The BroMans and The Helms Dynasty in an &quot;Ascension To Hell&quot; match for an opportunity to challenge Decay for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On September 8, during special episode &quot;Delete or Decay&quot;, the Hardys faced Decay in a match held at the Hardy compound, where Brother Nero sacrificed himself to save Matt from Abyss. Thanks to Brother Nero&#x27;s sacrifice, Hardy was able to confront Rosemary and prevent his son Maxel from being abducted, which turned Hardy babyface as a result, and he furthered the face turn by healing Brother Nero in the Lake of Reincarnation. At Bound for Glory, the Hardys defeated Decay in &quot;The Great War&quot; to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship for the second time. On the October 6 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, they successfully defended their titles against Decay, in a Wolf Creek match.

On the November 3 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, the Hardys successfully defended the titles against The Tribunal. After the match, the Hardys were attacked by the masked trio known as Death Crew Council (DCC). After accepting DCC&#x27;s title challenge, The Hardys faced Bram and Kingston, and Matt pinned Kingston to retain the titles. On December 15, during special episode &quot;Total Nonstop Deletion&quot;, they were once again successful in retaining. Brother Nero attacked Crazzy Steve with the &quot;Twist of Fate&quot;, who then fell into a volcano (that had appeared on the compound in the weeks leading up the event), and was shot up into the sky, landing in the ring. Matt then covered him to win the match.

On the January 12, 2017, episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, The Hardys successfully defended their titles against The Wolves. At Genesis, The Hardys retained their titles against the DCC and Decay in a three-way tag team match. On &quot;Open Fight Night&quot;, the Hardys began a storyline where they would teleport to different promotions and win that promotions&#x27; tag team championship gold, which was referred to by Matt as their &quot;Expedition of Gold&quot;. On February 27, Hardy announced that both he and Jeff had finally left TNA, following years of speculation, with their contracts expiring that week. Though the two sides were reportedly close to a contract agreement, talks began to break down and changes in management prompted their departure from the company. The TNA World Tag Team Championships were vacated due to the Hardys&#x27; departure and was explained on TNA television in a segment where The Hardys teleported to their next Expedition of Gold destination, but a technicality resulted in them disappearing and the belts appearing in the arms of Decay.

==== Broken gimmick legal battle ====

Shortly after the departure of Matt and Jeff from TNA was made public, Matt&#x27;s wife, Reby, went on a social media tirade in which she repeatedly slammed TNA, the company&#x27;s new management and the way in which contract negotiations between the company and the Hardy family were conducted. A few weeks following this, the bad blood between the two sides intensified, so much so that the new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys&#x27; new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH&#x27;s 15th Anniversary pay–per–view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. While The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick.

Newly–appointed Impact Wrestling President Ed Nordholm credits the invention of and the vision behind the Broken gimmick to Jeremy Borash, Dave Lagana and Billy Corgan, and while Borash specifically had the most input into the gimmick of the three aside from Matt, the Hardy family deny that Borash was the sole person behind the gimmick. In November 2017, Impact Wrestling changed their policy, allowing all talent to retain complete ownership over their intellectual property, essentially forfeiting ownership of the &quot;Broken&quot; character to Hardy.

On January 31, 2018, the legal battle officially concluded when Matt legally acquired ownership of all trademarks related to the Broken universe and the Broken gimmick, which includes &#x27;Broken Matt&#x27;, &#x27;Brother Nero&#x27;, &#x27;Broken Brilliance&#x27; and &#x27;Vanguard1&#x27;.

=== International matches (2014–2015) ===
On November 1, 2014, Hardy traveled to Japan to compete for Wrestle-1 at the promotions Keiji Muto 30th Anniversary Hold Out show in a triple threat match against Seiya Sanada and Tajiri, which he lost.

On May 24, 2015, Hardy traveled to Mexico to compete as a team captain for Team TNA/Lucha Underground with teammates Mr. Anderson and Johnny Mundo at Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide&#x27;s 2015 Lucha Libre World Cup pay–per–view show. In the quarter–final round, Team TNA/Lucha Underground faced Team Rest of the World (Drew Galloway, Angélico and El Mesías) to a 15-minute time limit draw, with Team TNA/Lucha Underground winning in overtime and advancing to the semi–final round. In the semi–final round, Team TNA/Lucha Underground defeated Team MexLeyendas (Blue Demon Jr., Dr. Wagner Jr. and El Solar) to advance to the final round. In the final round, Team TNA/Lucha Underground faced Dream Team (El Patrón Alberto, Myzteziz and Rey Mysterio Jr.) to a 15–minute time limit draw, with Dream Team winning both the match and the tournament in overtime with Hardy on the losing end of the final pinfall.

=== Second return to ROH (2016–2017) ===
On December 2, 2016, Hardy returned to ROH for the second time while still under contract with TNA, appearing at the promotions Final Battle pay-per-view show as Broken Matt, where a video message showed him addressing The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) and The Briscoes (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe).

On March 4, 2017, in the same week that both Matt and Jeff were released from TNA, The Hardys defeated The Young Bucks in an impromptu match at ROH&#x27;s 2017 installment of the company&#x27;s Manhattan Mayhem show series to become the new ROH World Tag Team Champions for the first time. Moments after winning the titles, Hardy announced in a post-match promo that both he and Brother Nero (Jeff) had signed &quot;the biggest ROH contracts in (the company&#x27;s) history&quot;. It was later confirmed that the contracts were short-term, only for the &quot;immediate future&quot;. On March 10, The Hardys successfully defended the ROH World Tag Team Championship for the first time at ROH&#x27;s 15th Anniversary pay-per-view show against The Young Bucks and Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero) in a three-way Las Vegas tag team street fight match. Prior to the event, the Hardys had been sent a legal threat by Impact Wrestling regarding the use of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero gimmicks. The following night on March 11, The Hardys (not billed but using the Broken gimmicks anyway) once again retained the titles, this time against The Briscoes at a set of &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&quot; television tapings. The Hardys lost the titles back to The Young Bucks in a ladder match on April 1 at ROH&#x27;s Supercard of Honor XI pay-per-view show, which would be the final ROH appearances for both Hardys in this tenure with the promotion.

=== Second return to WWE (2017–2020) ===
==== Tag team championship&#x27;s reigns (2017–2019) ====
At the WrestleMania 33 pay-per-view on April 2, 2017, Hardy made his surprise return to WWE, along with his brother Jeff Hardy, being added as last-minute participants in the ladder match for the Raw Tag Team Championship, defeating Gallows and Anderson, Cesaro and Sheamus, and Enzo and Cass to win the Raw Tag Team Championship. Afterwards on &quot;Raw Talk&quot;, Hardy mentioned that The Hardy Boyz had successfully completed the Expedition of Gold, after winning the Raw Tag Team Championship. At Payback, The Hardy Boyz retained their championships against Cesaro and Sheamus, who attacked them after the match. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cesaro and Sheamus explained their actions, claiming the fans were more supportive of &#x27;novelty acts&#x27; from the past like The Hardy Boyz, who they feel did not deserve to be in the match at WrestleMania 33. Subsequently, at Extreme Rules, The Hardy Boyz lost the titles against Cesaro and Sheamus in a steel cage match, and failed to regain it back the following month at the Great Balls of Fire event. Afterwards, it was revealed that Jeff had gotten injured and would be out for an estimated six months, thus Hardy began wrestling in singles matches.

During his feud with Bray Wyatt, Hardy introduced his &quot;Woken&quot; gimmick, after Impact Wrestling dropped their claim to the gimmick and Hardy gained full ownership of it. Wyatt defeated Hardy at &quot;Raw 25&quot; on January 22, 2018, and Hardy defeated Wyatt at Elimination Chamber on February 25. Their final match happened on the March 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, dubbed &quot;The Ultimate Deletion&quot;, with Hardy winning after distractions from Señor Benjamin. Wyatt then disappeared after being thrown into the Lake of Reincarnation. At WrestleMania 34 on April 7, Hardy competed in the annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, and won the match due to a distraction by the returning Wyatt. After WrestleMania, Hardy and Wyatt performed as a tag team, sometimes referred to as The Deleters of Worlds. They won a tournament for the vacant Raw Tag Team Championship, defeating Cesaro and Sheamus at the Greatest Royal Rumble event to win the title. However, they lost the titles at Extreme Rules to The B-Team (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel). On the July 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy and Wyatt received a rematch for the titles, but was again defeated by The B-Team. Following this, Hardy revealed that he was taking time off due to his back fusing with his pelvis, effectively disbanding the team. According to Hardy, the reason WWE disbanded the team was because he and Wyatt pitched several ideas to WWE to work with their characters.

After more than seven months of absence from television, Hardy returned on the February 26, 2019, episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, teaming with his brother Jeff to defeat The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus). At WrestleMania 35 on April 7, Hardy competed in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, but was eliminated by eventual winner, Braun Strowman. Two days later on &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, The Hardy Boyz defeated The Usos to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. The reign only lasted 21 days (recognized as 20 days by WWE), as they had to vacate the title due to Jeff injuring his knee, this was explained in storyline as injuries afflicted by Lars Sullivan. After his brother Jeff&#x27;s injury, Hardy began to appear on WWE programming less frequently.

==== Sporadic appearances and departure (2019–2020) ====
At Super ShowDown on June 7, Hardy competed in the 51-man Battle Royal, which was eventually won by Mansoor. From November to December, Hardy occasionally appeared on &quot;Raw&quot;, losing matches against superstars like Buddy Murphy, Drew McIntyre, Ricochet and Erick Rowan.

On the February 10, 2020, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy confronted Randy Orton about Orton&#x27;s attack on Edge two weeks earlier. Hardy then got himself into a brawl with him moments after, and was viciously attacked by Orton. The following week on Raw, an injured Hardy appeared and was once again assaulted by Orton, which would be his final appearance in WWE. On March 2, Hardy announced his departure from WWE through his official YouTube channel, where Hardy said that while he was grateful towards the people behind the scenes, he said he was also on different pages with WWE as he felt he needed to have creative input and still had more to give. Later that day, WWE announced that his contract had expired.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2020–2024) ===

==== Multiple personalities (2020–2021) ====
Hardy made his All Elite Wrestling (AEW) debut on the March 18, 2020, episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, reverting to his &quot;Broken&quot; gimmick and being announced as the replacement for the kayfabe injured Nick Jackson on The Elite&#x27;s team at &quot;Blood and Guts&quot;. However, the event was postponed to the following year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On the May 6 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Hardy wrestled his first match with AEW, teaming up with Kenny Omega for a street fight against The Inner Circle&#x27;s Chris Jericho and Sammy Guevara, and Hardy and Omega lost when Jericho pinned Omega. During this period, due to the lack of live audience, Hardy felt that the Broken character needed the fans, so he began to include several of his gimmicks alongside the Broken gimmick, including Big Money Matt, Matt Hardy V1, and Unkillable Matt Hardy, being referred to as &quot;Multifarious&quot; Matt Hardy. AEW president Tony Khan later admitted that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t a fan&quot; of the Broken gimmick and much preferred more realistic presentations in wrestling.

At Double or Nothing, Hardy teamed with The Elite to defeat The Inner Circle in the first ever Stadium Stampede match. During the match, Santana and Ortiz dunked Hardy in the stadium pool, which acted as a version of the Lake of Reincarnation, as Hardy kept cycling through his various gimmicks throughout his career when he surfaced. Hardy then feuded with Sammy Guevara, and after Hardy defeated Guevara in a Broken Rules match at All Out, Hardy took time off until he was cleared to return, due to an injury sustained during the match. On the September 16 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Hardy aligned with Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) as their manager, but was attacked backstage before their match. The attacker was later revealed as Guevara and The Elite Deletion match was announced, which took place at The Hardy Compound in Cameron, North Carolina, where Hardy won.

==== The Hardy Family Office (2021–2022) ====
Hardy then switched to his Big Money persona as he focused on managing Private Party. Over the following weeks, Hardy would display villainous tactics as he began cheating during matches much to Private Party&#x27;s dismay. On the January 20, 2021, episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Hardy and Private Party defeated Matt Sydal and Top Flight (Dante Martin and Darius Martin) after using a steel chair before attacking Sydal and Top Flight afterwards, thus turning heel. Hardy then approached Adam Page to accompany and befriend him, and during tag team matches, Hardy would always tag himself in and pick up the victory for his team to Page&#x27;s behest. After Page set up a match between Hardy and himself, Hardy double-crossed Page, with Private Party and The Hybrid 2 (Angélico and Jack Evans) attacking Page until The Dark Order came out to save him. At the Revolution event, Hardy lost to Page despite multiple interferences from Private Party.

Following Revolution, Hardy became the manager for The Butcher and The Blade (with their valet The Bunny in tow), and along with Private Party, the stable became known as the Matt Hardy Empire before settling on the name Hardy Family Office. Hardy also added The Hybrid 2 to his group in July having previously hiring them on a mercenary basis. At Double or Nothing, Hardy competed in Casino Battle Royale but was eliminated by Christian Cage. This led to a match between the two at Fyter Fest, where Hardy lost to Cage. In August, Matt Hardy and HFO began a feud with Orange Cassidy and Best Friends, which led to a match on the August 25 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, where Hardy was defeated by Cassidy. However, on the November 12 episode of &quot;Rampage&quot;, Hardy defeated Cassidy in a Lumberjack match, thanks to an interference from HFO and the heel lumberjacks. Their feud ended on the November 17 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot; where his team of The Butcher and The Blade lost to the team of Cassidy and Tomohiro Ishii, where Cassidy gave a crossbody to the interfering Hardy and The Blade during the match. At Revolution 2022, Hardy would lose a Tornado tag team match with Andrade El Idolo and Isiah Kassidy against Sammy Guevara, Darby Allin, and Sting.

==== The Hardy Boyz reunion and The Firm (2022–2024) ====
On the March 9 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Matt was attacked by Team AHFO (Andrade, Private Party, Butcher and Blade), which he was later saved by Darby Allin, Sting, and the debuting Jeff Hardy. He reunited with his brother Jeff, thus turning face in the process. On the October 12 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Stokely Hathaway reveals he has bought Private Party&#x27;s contracts from LFI. During this segment, a challenge is made for &quot;Rampage&quot; for a match between Ethan Page and Isiah Kassidy. If Kassidy wins, Private Party is free from The Firm. If Page wins, The Firm acquires Matt Hardy&#x27;s contract. On the October 14 episode of &quot;Rampage&quot;, Page won the match which Hardy and Private Party would have to join The Firm. Over the next few week, Hardy was banned from using the Hardy theme and Twist of Fate. On April 12, 2023, episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Matt and Kassidy was attacked by The Firm (Ethan Page, Lee Moriarty and Big Bill), which they were later saved by Hook and a returning Jeff Hardy. On April 8, 2024, it was reported that Hardy’s contract had expired and he had chosen not to re-sign.

=== Second return to TNA (2024-present) ===
Hardy made his surprise return to TNA on April 20, 2024 at Rebellion, reverting back to his &quot;Broken&quot; gimmick and attacking TNA World Champion Moose. On June 14 at Against All Odds, Hardy unsuccessfully challenged Moose for the championship. After the match, Hardy&#x27;s brother Jeff made his return to TNA to come to Hardy&#x27;s aid from a post-match attack from Moose. At that year&#x27;s Bound for Glory, The Hardys defeated The System and ABC in a Three-way Full Metal Mayhem match to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship for the third time.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
After the creation of his Broken character, Hardy was praised by several wrestlers and critics for reinventing himself several times during his career.

<doc id="354588" wikidata="Q867648" url="?curid=354588" title="Hydrothermal vent">
<text>Hydrothermal vents are fissures on the seabed from which geothermally heated water discharges. They are commonly found near volcanically active places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart at mid-ocean ridges, ocean basins, and hotspots. The dispersal of hydrothermal fluids throughout the global ocean at active vent sites creates hydrothermal plumes. Hydrothermal deposits are rocks and mineral ore deposits formed by the action of hydrothermal vents.

Hydrothermal vents exist because the Earth is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. Under the sea, they may form features called black smokers or white smokers, which deliver a wide range of elements to the world&#x27;s oceans, thus contributing to global marine biogeochemistry. Relative to the majority of the deep sea, the areas around hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive, often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea found around hydrothermal vents form the base of the food chain, supporting diverse organisms including giant tube worms, clams, limpets, and shrimp. Active hydrothermal vents are thought to exist on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa and Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus, and it is speculated that ancient hydrothermal vents once existed on Mars.

Hydrothermal vents have been hypothesized to have been a significant factor to starting abiogenesis and the survival of primitive life. The conditions of these vents have been shown to support the synthesis of molecules important to life. Some evidence suggests that certain vents such as alkaline hydrothermal vents or those containing supercritical CO2 are more conducive to the formation of these organic molecules. However, the origin of life is a widely debated topic, and there are many conflicting viewpoints.

==Physical properties==
Hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean typically form along the mid-ocean ridges, such as the East Pacific Rise and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These are locations where two tectonic plates are diverging and new crust is being formed.

The water that issues from seafloor hydrothermal vents consists mostly of seawater drawn into the hydrothermal system close to the volcanic edifice through faults and porous sediments or volcanic strata, plus some magmatic water released by the upwelling magma. On land, the majority of water circulated within fumarole and geyser systems is meteoric water and ground water that has percolated down into the hydrothermal system from the surface, but also commonly contains some portion of metamorphic water, magmatic water, and sedimentary formational brine released by the magma. The proportion of each varies from location to location.

In contrast to the approximately ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from up to as high as . Due to the high hydrostatic pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures. The critical point of (pure) water is at a pressure of 218 atmospheres.

However, introducing salinity into the fluid raises the critical point to higher temperatures and pressures. The critical point of seawater (3.2 wt. % NaCl) is and 298.5 bars, corresponding to a depth of ~ below sea level. Accordingly, if a hydrothermal fluid with a salinity of 3.2 wt. % NaCl vents above and 298.5 bars, it is supercritical. Furthermore, the salinity of vent fluids have been shown to vary widely due to phase separation in the crust. The critical point for lower salinity fluids is at lower temperature and pressure conditions than that for seawater, but higher than that for pure water. For example, a vent fluid with a 2.24 wt. % NaCl salinity has the critical point at and 280.5 bars. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.Examples of supercritical venting are found at several sites. &quot;Sister Peak&quot; (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, , depth ) vents low salinity phase-separated, vapor-type fluids. Sustained venting was not found to be supercritical but a brief injection of was well above supercritical conditions. A nearby site, Turtle Pits, was found to vent low salinity fluid at , which is above the critical point of the fluid at that salinity. A vent site in the Cayman Trough named Beebe, which is the world&#x27;s deepest known hydrothermal site at ~ below sea level, has shown sustained supercritical venting at and 2.3 wt% NaCl.

Although supercritical conditions have been observed at several sites, it is not yet known what significance, if any, supercritical venting has in terms of hydrothermal circulation, mineral deposit formation, geochemical fluxes or biological activity.

The initial stages of a vent chimney begin with the deposition of the mineral anhydrite. Sulfides of copper, iron, and zinc then precipitate in the chimney gaps, making it less porous over the course of time. Vent growths on the order of per day have been recorded. An April 2007 exploration of the deep-sea vents off the coast of Fiji found those vents to be a significant source of dissolved iron (see iron cycle).

==Black smokers and white smokers==

Some hydrothermal vents form roughly cylindrical chimney structures. These form from minerals that are dissolved in the vent fluid. When the superheated water contacts the near-freezing sea water, the minerals precipitate out to form particles which add to the height of the stacks. Some of these chimney structures can reach heights of . An example of such a towering vent was &quot;Godzilla&quot;, a structure on the Pacific Ocean deep seafloor near Oregon that rose to before it fell over in 1996.

=== Black smokers ===

A black smoker or deep-sea vent is a type of hydrothermal vent found on the seabed, typically in the bathyal zone (with largest frequency in depths from ), but also in lesser depths as well as deeper in the abyssal zone. They appear as black, chimney-like structures that emit a cloud of black material. Black smokers typically emit particles with high levels of sulfur-bearing minerals, or sulfides. Black smokers are formed in fields hundreds of meters wide when superheated water from below Earth&#x27;s crust comes through the ocean floor (water may attain temperatures above ). This water is rich in dissolved minerals from the crust, most notably sulfides. When it comes in contact with cold ocean water, many minerals precipitate, forming a black, chimney-like structure around each vent. Chimney&#x27;s thicken due to heat conduction encouraging crystallization. The deposited metal sulfides can become massive sulfide ore deposits in time. Some black smokers on the Azores portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are extremely rich in metal content, such as Rainbow with 24,000 μM concentrations of iron. 

Black smokers were first discovered in 1979 on the East Pacific Rise by scientists from Scripps Institution of Oceanography during the RISE Project. They were observed using the deep submergence vehicle ALVIN from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Now, black smokers are known to exist in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, at an average depth of . The most northerly black smokers are a cluster of five named Loki&#x27;s Castle, discovered in 2008 by scientists from the University of Bergen at 73°N, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between Greenland and Norway. These black smokers are of interest as they are in a more stable area of the Earth&#x27;s crust, where tectonic forces are less and consequently fields of hydrothermal vents are less common. The world&#x27;s deepest known black smokers are located in the Cayman Trough, 5,000 m (3.1 miles) below the ocean&#x27;s surface.

=== White smokers ===
White smoker vents emit lighter-hued minerals, such as those containing barium, calcium and silicon. These vents also tend to have lower-temperature plumes probably because they are generally distant from their heat source.

Black and white smokers may coexist in the same hydrothermal field, but they generally represent proximal (close) and distal (distant) vents to the main upflow zone, respectively. However, white smokers correspond mostly to waning stages of such hydrothermal fields, as magmatic heat sources become progressively more distant from the source (due to magma crystallization) and hydrothermal fluids become dominated by seawater instead of magmatic water. Mineralizing fluids from this type of vent are rich in calcium and they form dominantly sulfate-rich (i.e., barite and anhydrite) and carbonate deposits.

== Hydrothermal plumes ==

Hydrothermal plumes are fluid entities that manifest where hydrothermal fluids are expelled into the overlying water column at active hydrothermal vent sites. As hydrothermal fluids typically harbor physical (e.g., temperature, density) and chemical (e.g., pH, Eh, major ions) properties distinct from seawater, hydrothermal plumes embody physical and chemical gradients that promote several types of chemical reactions, including oxidation-reduction reactions and precipitation reactions. 

Hydrothermal vent fluids harbor temperatures (~40 to &gt;400 °C) well above that of ocean floor seawater (~4 °C), meaning that hydrothermal fluid is less dense than the surrounding seawater and will rise through the water column due to buoyancy, forming a hydrothermal plume; therefore, the phase during which hydrothermal plumes rise through the water column is known as the &quot;buoyant plume&quot; phase. During this phase, shear forces between the hydrothermal plume and surrounding seawater generate turbulent flow that facilitates mixing between the two types of fluids, which progressively dilutes the hydrothermal plume with seawater. Eventually, the coupled effects of dilution and rising into progressively warmer (less dense) overlying seawater will cause the hydrothermal plume to become neutrally buoyant at some height above the seafloor; therefore, this stage of hydrothermal plume evolution is known as the &quot;nonbuoyant plume&quot; phase. Once the plume is neutrally buoyant, it can no longer continue to rise through the water column and instead begins to spread laterally throughout the ocean, potentially over several thousands of kilometers.

Chemical reactions occur concurrently with the physical evolution of hydrothermal plumes. While seawater is a relatively oxidizing fluid, hydrothermal vent fluids are typically reducing in nature. Consequently, reduced chemicals such as hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide, methane, Fe2+, and Mn2+ that are common in many vent fluids will react upon mixing with seawater. In fluids with high concentrations of H2S, dissolved metal ions such as Fe2+ and Mn2+ readily precipitate as dark-colored metal sulfide minerals (see &quot;black smokers&quot;). Furthermore, Fe2+ and Mn2+ entrained within the hydrothermal plume will eventually oxidize to form insoluble Fe and Mn (oxy)hydroxide minerals. For this reason, the hydrothermal &quot;near field&quot; has been proposed to refer to the hydrothermal plume region undergoing active oxidation of metals while the term &quot;far field&quot; refers to the plume region within which complete metal oxidation has occurred.

=== Identification and dating ===

Several chemical tracers found in hydrothermal plumes are used to locate deep-sea hydrothermal vents during discovery cruises. Useful tracers of hydrothermal activity should be chemically unreactive so that changes in tracer concentration subsequent to venting are due solely to dilution. The noble gas helium fits this criterion and is a particularly useful tracer of hydrothermal activity. This is because hydrothermal venting releases elevated concentrations of helium-3 relative to seawater, a rare, naturally occurring He isotope derived exclusively from the Earth&#x27;s interior. Thus, the dispersal of 3He throughout the oceans via hydrothermal plumes creates anomalous seawater He isotope compositions that signify hydrothermal venting. Another noble gas that can serve as a tracer of hydrothermal activity is radon. As all naturally occurring isotopes of Rn are radioactive, Rn concentrations in seawater can also provide information on hydrothermal plume ages when combined with He isotope data. The isotope radon-222 is utilized for this purpose as 222Rn has the longest half-life of all naturally occurring radon isotopes of roughly 3.82 days. Dissolved gases, such as H2, H2S, and CH4, and metals, such as Fe and Mn, present at high concentrations in hydrothermal vent fluids relative to seawater may also be diagnostic of hydrothermal plumes and thus active venting; however, these components are reactive and are thus less suitable as tracers of hydrothermal activity.

=== Ocean biogeochemistry ===

Hydrothermal plumes represent an important mechanism through which hydrothermal systems influence marine biogeochemistry. Hydrothermal vents emit a wide variety of trace metals into the ocean, including Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Mo, Cd, V, and W, many of which have biological functions. Numerous physical and chemical processes control the fate of these metals once they are expelled into the water column. Based on thermodynamic theory, Fe2+ and Mn2+ should oxidize in seawater to form insoluble metal (oxy)hydroxide precipitates; however, complexation with organic compounds and the formation of colloids and nanoparticles can keep these redox-sensitive elements suspended in solution far from the vent site.

Fe and Mn often have the highest concentrations among metals in acidic hydrothermal vent fluids, and both have biological significance, particularly Fe, which is often a limiting nutrient in marine environments. Therefore, far-field transport of Fe and Mn via organic complexation may constitute an important mechanism of ocean metal cycling. Additionally, hydrothermal vents deliver significant concentrations of other biologically important trace metals to the ocean such as Mo, which may have been important in the early chemical evolution of the Earth&#x27;s oceans and to the origin of life (see &quot;theory of hydrothermal origin of life&quot;). However, Fe and Mn precipitates can also influence ocean biogeochemistry by removing trace metals from the water column. The charged surfaces of iron (oxy)hydroxide minerals effectively adsorb elements such as phosphorus, vanadium, arsenic, and rare earth metals from seawater; therefore, although hydrothermal plumes may represent a net source of metals such as Fe and Mn to the oceans, they can also scavenge other metals and non-metalliferous nutrients such as P from seawater, representing a net sink of these elements.

==Biology of hydrothermal vents==
Life has traditionally been seen as driven by energy from the sun, but deep-sea organisms have no access to sunlight, so biological communities around hydrothermal vents must depend on nutrients found in the dusty chemical deposits and hydrothermal fluids in which they live. Previously, benthic oceanographers assumed that vent organisms were dependent on marine snow, as deep-sea organisms are. This would leave them dependent on plant life and thus the sun. Some hydrothermal vent organisms do consume this &quot;rain&quot;, but with only such a system, life forms would be sparse. Compared to the surrounding sea floor, however, hydrothermal vent zones have a density of organisms 10,000 to 100,000 times greater. These organisms include yeti crabs, which have long hairy arms that they reach out over the vent to collect food with.

The hydrothermal vents are recognized as a type of chemosynthetic based ecosystems (CBE) where primary productivity is fuelled by chemical compounds as energy sources instead of light (chemoautotrophy). Hydrothermal vent communities are able to sustain such vast amounts of life because vent organisms depend on chemosynthetic bacteria for food. The water from the hydrothermal vent is rich in dissolved minerals and supports a large population of chemoautotrophic bacteria. These bacteria use sulfur compounds, particularly hydrogen sulfide, a chemical highly toxic to most known organisms, to produce organic material through the process of chemosynthesis.

The vents&#x27; impact on the living environment goes beyond the organisms that lives around them, as they act as a significant source of iron in the oceans, providing iron for the phytoplankton.

===Biological communities===

The oldest confirmed record of a &quot;modern&quot; biological community related with a vent is the Figueroa Sulfide, from the Early Jurassic of California. The ecosystem so formed is reliant upon the continued existence of the hydrothermal vent field as the primary source of energy, which differs from most surface life on Earth, which is based on solar energy. However, although it is often said that these communities exist independently of the sun, some of the organisms are actually dependent upon oxygen produced by photosynthetic organisms, while others are anaerobic.

The chemosynthetic bacteria grow into a thick mat which attracts other organisms, such as amphipods and copepods, which graze upon the bacteria directly. Larger organisms, such as snails, shrimp, crabs, tube worms, fish (especially eelpout, cutthroat eel, Ophidiiformes and &quot;Symphurus thermophilus&quot;), and octopuses (notably &quot;Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis&quot;), form a food chain of predator and prey relationships above the primary consumers. The main families of organisms found around seafloor vents are annelids, pogonophorans, gastropods, and crustaceans, with large bivalves, vestimentiferan worms, and &quot;eyeless&quot; shrimp making up the bulk of nonmicrobial organisms.

Siboglinid tube worms, which may grow to over tall in the largest species, often form an important part of the community around a hydrothermal vent. They have no mouth or digestive tract, and like parasitic worms, absorb nutrients produced by the bacteria in their tissues. About 285 billion bacteria are found per ounce of tubeworm tissue. Tubeworms have red plumes which contain hemoglobin. Hemoglobin combines with hydrogen sulfide and transfers it to the bacteria living inside the worm. In return, the bacteria nourish the worm with carbon compounds. Two of the species that inhabit a hydrothermal vent are &quot;Tevnia jerichonana&quot;, and &quot;Riftia pachyptila&quot;. One discovered community, dubbed &quot;Eel City&quot;, consists predominantly of the eel &quot;Dysommina rugosa&quot;. Though eels are not uncommon, invertebrates typically dominate hydrothermal vents. Eel City is located near Nafanua volcanic cone, American Samoa.

In 1993, already more than 100 gastropod species were known to occur in hydrothermal vents. Over 300 new species have been discovered at hydrothermal vents, many of them &quot;sister species&quot; to others found in geographically separated vent areas. It has been proposed that before the North American Plate overrode the mid-ocean ridge, there was a single biogeographic vent region found in the eastern Pacific. The subsequent barrier to travel began the evolutionary divergence of species in different locations. The examples of convergent evolution seen between distinct hydrothermal vents is seen as major support for the theory of natural selection and of evolution as a whole.

Although life is very sparse at these depths, black smokers are the centers of entire ecosystems. Sunlight is nonexistent, so many organisms, such as archaea and extremophiles, convert the heat, methane, and sulfur compounds provided by black smokers into energy through a process called chemosynthesis. More complex life forms, such as clams and tubeworms, feed on these organisms. The organisms at the base of the food chain also deposit minerals into the base of the black smoker, therefore completing the life cycle.

A species of phototrophic bacterium has been found living near a black smoker off the coast of Mexico at a depth of . No sunlight penetrates that far into the waters. Instead, the bacteria, part of the Chlorobiaceae family, use the faint glow from the black smoker for photosynthesis. This is the first organism discovered in nature to exclusively use a light other than sunlight for photosynthesis.

New and unusual species are constantly being discovered in the neighborhood of black smokers. The Pompeii worm &quot;Alvinella pompejana&quot;, which is capable of withstanding temperatures up to , was found in the 1980s, and a scaly-foot gastropod &quot;Chrysomallon squamiferum&quot; in 2001 during an expedition to the Indian Ocean&#x27;s Kairei hydrothermal vent field. The latter uses iron sulfides (pyrite and greigite) for the structure of its dermal sclerites (hardened body parts), instead of calcium carbonate. The extreme pressure of 2,500 m of water (approximately 25 megapascals or 250 atmospheres) is thought to play a role in stabilizing iron sulfide for biological purposes. This armor plating probably serves as a defense against the venomous radula (teeth) of predatory snails in that community.

In March 2017, researchers reported evidence of possibly the oldest forms of life on Earth. Putative fossilized microorganisms were discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec, Canada, that may have lived as early as 4.280 billion years ago, not long after the oceans formed 4.4 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.


===Animal-bacterial symbiosis===
Hydrothermal vent ecosystems have enormous biomass and productivity, but this rests on the symbiotic relationships that have evolved at vents. Deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems differ from their shallow-water and terrestrial hydrothermal counterparts due to the symbiosis that occurs between macroinvertebrate hosts and chemoautotrophic microbial symbionts in the former. Since sunlight does not reach deep-sea hydrothermal vents, organisms in deep-sea hydrothermal vents cannot obtain energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis. Instead, the microbial life found at hydrothermal vents is chemosynthetic; they fix carbon by using energy from chemicals such as sulfide, as opposed to light energy from the sun. In other words, the symbiont converts inorganic molecules (H2S, CO2, O) to organic molecules that the host then uses as nutrition. However, sulfide is an extremely toxic substance to most life on Earth. For this reason, scientists were astounded when they first found hydrothermal vents teeming with life in 1977. What was discovered was the ubiquitous symbiosis of chemoautotrophs living in (endosymbiosis) the vent animals&#x27; gills; the reason why multicellular life is capable to survive the toxicity of vent systems. Scientists are therefore now studying how the microbial symbionts aid in sulfide detoxification (therefore allowing the host to survive the otherwise toxic conditions). Work on microbiome function shows that host-associated microbiomes are also important in host development, nutrition, defense against predators, and detoxification. In return, the host provides the symbiont with chemicals required for chemosynthesis, such as carbon, sulfide, and oxygen.

In the early stages of studying life at hydrothermal vents, there were differing theories regarding the mechanisms by which multicellular organisms were able to acquire nutrients from these environments, and how they were able to survive in such extreme conditions. In 1977, it was hypothesized that the chemoautotrophic bacteria at hydrothermal vents might be responsible for contributing to the diet of suspension-feeding bivalves.

Finally, in 1981, it was understood that giant tubeworm nutrition acquisition occurred as a result of chemoautotrophic bacterial endosymbionts. As scientists continued to study life at hydrothermal vents, it was understood that symbiotic relationships between chemoautotrophs and macrofauna invertebrate species was ubiquitous. For instance, in 1983, clam gill tissue was confirmed to contain bacterial endosymbionts; in 1984 vent bathymodiolid mussels and vesicomyid clams were also found to carry endosymbionts.

However, the mechanisms by which organisms acquire their symbionts differ, as do the metabolic relationships. For instance, tubeworms have no mouth and no gut, but they do have a &quot;trophosome&quot;, which is where they deal with nutrition and where their endosymbionts are found. They also have a bright red plume, which they use to uptake compounds such as O, H2S, and CO2, which feed the endosymbionts in their trophosome. Remarkably, the tubeworms hemoglobin (which incidentally is the reason for the bright red color of the plume) is capable of carrying oxygen without interference or inhibition from sulfide, despite the fact that oxygen and sulfide are typically very reactive. In 2005, it was discovered that this is possible due to zinc ions that bind the hydrogen sulfide in the tubeworms hemoglobin, therefore preventing the sulfide from reacting with the oxygen. It also reduces the tubeworms tissue from exposure to the sulfide and provides the bacteria with the sulfide to perform chemoautotrophy. It has also been discovered that tubeworms can metabolize CO2 in two different ways, and can alternate between the two as needed as environmental conditions change.

In 1988, research confirmed thiotrophic (sulfide-oxidizing) bacteria in &quot;Alviniconcha hessleri&quot;, a large vent mollusk. In order to circumvent the toxicity of sulfide, mussels first convert it to thiosulfate before carrying it over to the symbionts. In the case of motile organisms such as alvinocarid shrimp, they must track oxic (oxygen-rich) / anoxic (oxygen-poor) environments as they fluctuate in the environment.

Organisms living at the edge of hydrothermal vent fields, such as pectinid scallops, also carry endosymbionts in their gills, and as a result their bacterial density is low relative to organisms living nearer to the vent. However, the scallop&#x27;s dependence on the microbial endosymbiont for obtaining their nutrition is therefore also lessened.

Furthermore, not all host animals have endosymbionts; some have episymbionts—symbionts living on the animal as opposed to inside the animal. Shrimp found at vents in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge were once thought of as an exception to the necessity of symbiosis for macroinvertebrate survival at vents. That changed in 1988 when they were discovered to carry episymbionts. Since then, other organisms at vents have been found to carry episymbionts as well, such as Lepetodrilis fucensis.

Furthermore, while some symbionts reduce sulfur compounds, others are known as &quot;methanotrophs&quot; and reduce carbon compounds, namely methane. Bathmodiolid mussels are an example of a host that contains methanotrophic endosymbionts; however, the latter mostly occur in cold seeps as opposed to hydrothermal vents.

While chemosynthesis occurring at the deep ocean allows organisms to live without sunlight in the immediate sense, they technically still rely on the sun for survival, since oxygen in the ocean is a byproduct of photosynthesis. However, if the sun were to suddenly disappear and photosynthesis ceased to occur on our planet, life at the deep-sea hydrothermal vents could continue for millennia (until the oxygen was depleted).

===Theory of hydrothermal origin of life===
The chemical and thermal dynamics in hydrothermal vents makes such environments highly suitable thermodynamically for chemical evolution processes to take place. Therefore, thermal energy flux is a permanent agent and is hypothesized to have contributed to the evolution of the planet, including prebiotic chemistry.

Günter Wächtershäuser proposed the iron-sulfur world theory and suggested that life might have originated at hydrothermal vents. Wächtershäuser proposed that an early form of metabolism predated genetics. By metabolism he meant a cycle of chemical reactions that release energy in a form that can be harnessed by other processes.

It has been proposed that amino acid synthesis could have occurred deep in the Earth&#x27;s crust and that these amino acids were subsequently shot up along with hydrothermal fluids into cooler waters, where lower temperatures and the presence of clay minerals would have fostered the formation of peptides and protocells. This is an attractive hypothesis because of the abundance of CH4 (methane) and NH3 (ammonia) present in hydrothermal vent regions, a condition that was not provided by the Earth&#x27;s primitive atmosphere. A major limitation to this hypothesis is the lack of stability of organic molecules at high temperatures, but some have suggested that life would have originated outside of the zones of highest temperature. There are numerous species of extremophiles and other organisms currently living immediately around deep-sea vents, suggesting that this is indeed a possible scenario.

Experimental research and computer modeling indicate that the surfaces of mineral particles inside hydrothermal vents have similar catalytic properties to enzymes and are able to create simple organic molecules, such as methanol (CH3OH) and formic acid (HCO2H), out of the dissolved CO2 in the water. Additionally, the discovery of supercritical CO2 at some sites has been used to further support the theory of hydrothermal origin of life given that it can increase organic reaction rates. Its high solvation power and diffusion rate allow it to promote amino and formic acid synthesis, as well as the synthesis of other organic compounds, polymers, and the four amino acids: alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, and glycine. In situ experiments have revealed the convergence of high N2 content and supercritical CO2 at some sites, as well as evidence for complex organic material (amino acids) within supercritical CO2 bubbles. Proponents of this theory for the origin of life also propose the presence of supercritical CO2 as a solution to the &quot;water paradox&quot; that pervades theories on the origin of life in aquatic settings. This paradox encompasses the fact that water is both required for life and will, in abundance, hydrolyze organic molecules and prevent dehydration synthesis reactions necessary to chemical and biological evolution. Supercritical CO2, being hydrophobic, acts as a solvent that facilitates an environment conducive to dehydration synthesis. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the presence of supercritical CO2 in Hadean hydrothermal vents played an important role in the origin of life.

There is some evidence that links the origin of life to alkaline hydrothermal vents in particular. The pH conditions of these vents may have made them more suitable for emerging life. One current theory is that the naturally occurring proton gradients at these deep sea vents supplemented the lack of phospholipid bilayer membranes and proton pumps in early organisms, allowing ion gradients to form despite the lack of cellular machinery and components present in modern cells. There is some discourse around this topic. It has been argued that the natural pH gradients of these vents playing a role in the origin of life is actually implausible. The counter argument relies, among other points, on what the author describes as the unlikelihood of the formation of machinery which produces energy from the pH gradients found in hydrothermal vents without/before the existence of genetic information. This counterpoint has been responded to by Nick Lane, one of the researchers whose work it focuses on. He argues that the counterpoint largely misinterprets both his work and the work of others.

Another reason that the view of deep sea hydrothermal vents as an ideal environment for the origin of life remains controversial is the absence of wet-dry cycles and exposure to UV light, which promote the formation of membranous vesicles and synthesis of many biomolecules. The ionic concentrations of hydrothermal vents differs from the intracellular fluid within the majority of life. It has instead been suggested that terrestrial freshwater environments are more likely to be an ideal environment for the formation of early cells. Meanwhile, proponents of the deep sea hydrothermal vent hypothesis suggest thermophoresis in mineral cavities to be an alternative compartment for polymerization of biopolymers.

How thermophoresis within mineral cavities could promote coding and metabolism is unknown. Nick Lane suggests that nucleotide polymerization at high concentrations of nucleotides within self-replicating protocells, where &quot;Molecular crowding and phosphorylation in such confined, high-energy protocells could potentially promote the polymerization of nucleotides to form RNA&quot;. Acetyl phosphate could possibly promote polymerization at mineral surfaces or at low water activity. A computational simulation shows that nucleotide concentration of nucleotide catalysis of &quot;the energy currency pathway is favored, as energy is limiting; favoring this pathway feeds forward into a greater nucleotide synthesis&quot;. Fast nucleotide catalysis of fixation lowers nucleotide concentration as protocell growth and division is rapid which then leads to halving of nucleotide concentration, weak nucleotide catalysis of fixation promotes little to protocell growth and division.

In biochemistry, reactions with CO2 and H2 produce precursors to biomolecules that are also produced from the acetyl-CoA pathway and Krebs cycle which would support an origin of life at deep sea alkaline vents. Acetyl phosphate produced from the reactions are capable of phosphorylating ADP to ATP, with maximum synthesis occurring at high water activity and low concentrations of ions, the Hadean ocean likely had lower concentrations of ions than modern oceans. The concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ at alkaline hydrothermal systems are lower than the at the ocean. The high concentration of potassium within most life forms could be readily explained that protocells might have evolved sodium-hydrogen antiporters to pump out Na+ as prebiotic lipid membranes are less permeable to Na+ than H+. If cells originated at these environments, they would have been autotrophs with a Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and incomplete reverse Krebs cycle. Mathematical modelling of organic synthesis of carboxylic acids to lipids, nucleotides, amino acids, and sugars, and polymerization reactions are favorable at alkaline hydrothermal vents.

===&quot;The Deep Hot Biosphere&quot;===
At the beginning of his 1992 paper &quot;The Deep Hot Biosphere&quot;, Thomas Gold referred to &quot;ocean vents&quot; in support of his theory that the lower levels of the earth are rich in living biological material that finds its way to the surface. He further expanded his ideas in the book &quot;The Deep Hot Biosphere&quot;.

An article on &quot;abiogenic hydrocarbon production&quot; in the February 2008 issue of Science journal used data from experiments at the Lost City hydrothermal field to report how the abiotic synthesis of low molecular mass hydrocarbons from mantle derived carbon dioxide may occur in the presence of ultramafic rocks, water, and moderate amounts of heat.

==Discovery and exploration==

In 1949, a deep water survey reported anomalously hot brines in the central portion of the Red Sea. Later work in the 1960s confirmed the presence of hot, , saline brines and associated metalliferous muds. The hot solutions were emanating from an active subseafloor rift. The highly saline character of the waters was not hospitable to living organisms. The brines and associated muds are currently under investigation as a source of mineable precious and base metals.


In June 1976, scientists from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography obtained the first evidence for submarine hydrothermal vents along the Galápagos Rift, a spur of the East Pacific Rise, on the &quot;Pleiades II&quot; expedition, using the Deep-Tow seafloor imaging system. In 1977, the first scientific papers on hydrothermal vents were published by scientists from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography; research scientist Peter Lonsdale published photographs taken from deep-towed cameras, and PhD student Kathleen Crane published maps and temperature anomaly data. Transponders were deployed at the site, which was nicknamed &quot;Clam-bake&quot;, to enable an expedition to return the following year for direct observations with the DSV &quot;Alvin&quot;.

Chemosynthetic ecosystems surrounding the Galápagos Rift submarine hydrothermal vents were first directly observed in 1977, when a group of marine geologists funded by the National Science Foundation returned to the Clambake sites. The principal investigator for the submersible study was Jack Corliss of Oregon State University. Corliss and Tjeerd van Andel from Stanford University observed and sampled the vents and their ecosystem on February 17, 1977, while diving in the DSV &quot;Alvin&quot;, a research submersible operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). Other scientists on the research cruise included Richard (Dick) Von Herzen and Robert Ballard of WHOI, Jack Dymond and Louis Gordon of Oregon State University, John Edmond and Tanya Atwater of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dave Williams of the U.S. Geological Survey, and Kathleen Crane of Scripps Institution of Oceanography. This team published their observations of the vents, organisms, and the composition of the vent fluids in the journal Science. In 1979, a team of biologists led by J. Frederick Grassle, at the time at WHOI, returned to the same location to investigate the biological communities discovered two year earlier.

High temperature hydrothermal vents, the &quot;black smokers&quot;, were discovered in spring 1979 by a team from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography using the submersible &quot;Alvin&quot;. The RISE expedition explored the East Pacific Rise at 21° N with the goals of testing geophysical mapping of the sea floor with the &quot;Alvin&quot; and finding another hydrothermal field beyond the Galápagos Rift vents. The expedition was led by Fred Spiess and Ken Macdonald and included participants from the U.S., Mexico and France. The dive region was selected based on the discovery of sea floor mounds of sulfide minerals by the French CYAMEX expedition in 1978. Prior to dive operations, expedition member Robert Ballard located near-bottom water temperature anomalies using a deeply towed instrument package. The first dive was targeted at one of those anomalies. On Easter Sunday April 15, 1979 during a dive of &quot;Alvin&quot; to 2,600 meters, Roger Larson and Bruce Luyendyk found a hydrothermal vent field with a biological community similar to the Galápagos vents. On a subsequent dive on April 21, William Normark and Thierry Juteau discovered the high temperature vents emitting black mineral particle jets from chimneys; the black smokers. Following this Macdonald and Jim Aiken rigged a temperature probe to &quot;Alvin&quot; to measure the water temperature at the black smoker vents. This observed the highest temperatures then recorded at deep sea hydrothermal vents (380±30 °C). Analysis of black smoker material and the chimneys that fed them revealed that iron sulfide precipitates are the common minerals in the &quot;smoke&quot; and walls of the chimneys. 

In 2005, Neptune Resources NL, a mineral exploration company, applied for and was granted 35,000 km2 of exploration rights over the Kermadec Arc in New Zealand&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone to explore for seafloor massive sulfide deposits, a potential new source of lead-zinc-copper sulfides formed from modern hydrothermal vent fields. The discovery of a vent in the Pacific Ocean offshore of Costa Rica, named the Medusa hydrothermal vent field (after the serpent-haired Medusa of Greek mythology), was announced in April 2007. The Ashadze hydrothermal field (13°N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, elevation -4200 m) was the deepest known high-temperature hydrothermal field until 2010, when a hydrothermal plume emanating from the Beebe site (, elevation -5000 m) was detected by a group of scientists from NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. This site is located on the 110 km long, ultraslow spreading Mid-Cayman Rise within the Cayman Trough.
In early 2013, the deepest known hydrothermal vents were discovered in the Caribbean Sea at a depth of almost .

Oceanographers are studying the volcanoes and hydrothermal vents of the Juan de Fuca mid ocean ridge where tectonic plates are moving away from each other.

Hydrothermal vents and other geothermal manifestations are currently being explored in the Bahía de Concepción, Baja California Sur, Mexico.

==Distribution==
Hydrothermal vents are distributed along the Earth&#x27;s plate boundaries, although they may also be found at intra-plate locations such as hotspot volcanoes. As of 2009 there were approximately 500 known active submarine hydrothermal vent fields, with about half visually observed at the seafloor and the other half suspected from water column indicators and/or seafloor deposits.

Rogers et al. (2012) recognized at least 11 biogeographic provinces of hydrothermal vent systems:
# Mid-Atlantic Ridge province,
# East Scotia Ridge province,
# northern East Pacific Rise province,
# central East Pacific Rise province,
# southern East Pacific Rise province,
# south of the Easter Microplate,
# Indian Ocean province,
# four provinces in the western Pacific and many more.

==Exploitation==
Hydrothermal vents, in some instances, have led to the formation of exploitable mineral resources via the deposition of seafloor massive sulfide deposits. The Mount Isa orebody, located in Queensland, Australia, is an excellent example. Many hydrothermal vents are rich in cobalt, gold, copper, and rare earth metals essential for electronic components. Hydrothermal venting on the Archean seafloor is considered to have formed Algoma-type banded iron formations, which have been a source of iron ore.

Recently, mineral exploration companies, driven by the elevated price activity in the base metals sector during the mid-2000s, have turned their attention to the extraction of mineral resources from hydrothermal fields on the seafloor. Significant cost reductions are, in theory, possible.

In countries such as Japan, where mineral resources are primarily derived from international imports, there is a particular push for the extraction of seafloor mineral resources. The world&#x27;s first &quot;large-scale&quot; mining of hydrothermal vent mineral deposits was carried out by Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) in August – September, 2017. JOGMEC carried out this operation using the Research Vessel Hakurei. This mining was carried out at the &#x27;Izena hole/cauldron&#x27; vent field within the hydrothermally active back-arc basin known as the Okinawa Trough, which contains 15 confirmed vent fields according to the InterRidge Vents Database.

Two companies are currently engaged in the late stages of commencing to mine seafloor massive sulfides (SMS). Nautilus Minerals is in the advanced stages of commencing extraction from its Solwarra deposit, in the Bismarck Archipelago, and Neptune Minerals is at an earlier stage with its Rumble II West deposit, located on the Kermadec Arc, near the Kermadec Islands. Both companies are proposing using modified existing technology. Nautilus Minerals, in partnership with Placer Dome (now part of Barrick Gold), succeeded in 2006 in returning over 10 metric tons of mined SMS to the surface using modified drum cutters mounted on an ROV, a world first. Neptune Minerals in 2007 succeeded in recovering SMS sediment samples using a modified oil industry suction pump mounted on an ROV, also a world first.

Potential seafloor mining has environmental impacts, including dust plumes from mining machinery affecting filter-feeding organisms, collapsing or reopening vents, methane clathrate release, or even sub-oceanic land slides.

There are also potential environmental effects from the tools needed for mining these hydrothermal vent ecosystems, including noise pollution and anthropogenic light. Hydrothermal vent system mining would require the use of both submerged mining tools on the seafloor, including remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), as well as surface support vessels on the ocean surface. Inevitably, through the operation of these machines, some level of noise will be created, which presents a problem for hydrothermal vent organisms because, as they are up to 12,000 feet below the surface of the ocean, they experience very little sound. As a result of this, these organisms have evolved to have highly sensitive hearing organs, so if there is a sudden increase in noise, such as that created by mining machinery, there is potential to damage these auditory organs and harm the vent organisms. It is also important to consider that many studies have been able to show that a large percent of benthic organisms communicate using very low-frequency sounds; therefore, increasing ambient noise levels on the seafloor could potentially mask communication between the organisms and alter behavioral patterns. Similar to how deep-sea SMS mining tools create noise pollution, they also create anthropogenic light sources on the seafloor (from mining tools) and the ocean surface (from surface support vessels). Organisms at these hydrothermal vent systems are in the aphotic zone of the ocean and have adapted to very low light conditions. Studies on deep sea shrimp have shown the potential for flood lights used on the sea floor used in studying the vent systems to cause permanent retinal damage, warranting further research into the potential risk to other vent organisms. On top of the risk presented to deep-sea organisms, the surface support vessels use nocturnal anthropogenic lighting. Research has shown that this type of lighting on the ocean surface can disorient seabirds and cause fallout, where they fly toward the anthropogenic light and become exhausted or collide with man-made objects, resulting in injury or death. There is consideration for both aquatic and land organisms when evaluating the environmental effects of hydrothermal vent mining.

There are three mining waste processes, known as the side cast sediment release, dewatering process, and sediment shift or disturbance, that would be expected with the deep-sea mining processes and could result in the accumulation of a sediment plume or cloud, which can have substantial environmental implications. The side cast sediment release is a process that would occur at the seafloor and would involve the move of material at the seafloor by the submerged ROV&#x27;s and would most likely contribute to the formation of sediment plumes at the seafloor. The idea of side cast release is that the ROV&#x27;s would discard economically invaluable material to the side of the mining sight before transporting the sulfide material to the supporting vessel at the surface. The goal of this process is to reduce the amount of material being transferred to the surface and minimize land-based. The dewatering process is a mining waste process that would most likely contribute to the formation of sediment plumes from the surface. The method of mine waste disposal releases water from the ship that may have been obtained during the extraction and transport of the material from the seafloor to the surface. The third contribution to the formation of the sediment plume or cloud would be sediment disturbance and release. This mining waste contribution is mainly associated with the mining activity on the seafloor associated with the movement of the ROVs and the destructive disturbance of the seafloor as part of the mining process itself.

The two main environmental concerns as a result of these waste mining processes that contribute to the formation of the sediment plume would be the release of heavy metals and increased amounts of sediment released. The release of heavy metals is mainly associated with the dewatering process that would take place on board the ship at the surface of the water. The main problem associated with dewatering is that it is not just the release of seawater re-entering the water column. Heavy metals such as copper and cobalt that would be sourced from the material extracted on the seafloor are also mixed in with the water that is released into the water column. The first environmental concern associated with the release of heavy metals is that it has the potential to change ocean chemistry within that localized water column area. The second concern would be that some of the heavy metals that could be released can have some level of toxicity to not only organisms inhabiting that area but also organisms passing through the mining site area. The concerns surrounding increased sediment release are mainly related to the other two mining waste processes, side cast sediment and seafloor sediment disturbance. The main environmental concern would be the smothering of organisms below as a result of redistributing large amounts of sediment to other areas on the seafloor, which could potentially threaten the population of organisms inhabiting the area. Redistribution of large quantities of sediment can also affect the feeding and gas exchange processes between organisms, posing a serious threat to the population. Finally, these processes can also increase the sedimentation rate on the seafloor, resulting in a predicted minimum of 500 m per every 1–10 km.

A large amount of work is currently being engaged in by both of the above-mentioned companies to ensure that the potential environmental impacts of seafloor mining are well understood and control measures are implemented before exploitation commences. However, this process has been arguably hindered by the disproportionate distribution of research effort among vent ecosystems; the best studied and understood hydrothermal vent ecosystems are not representative of those targeted for mining.

Attempts have been made in the past to exploit minerals from the seafloor. The 1960s and 1970s saw a great deal of activity (and expenditure) in the recovery of manganese nodules from the abyssal plains, with varying degrees of success. This does demonstrate, however, that the recovery of minerals from the seafloor is possible and has been possible for some time. Mining of manganese nodules served as a cover story for the elaborate attempt in 1974 by the CIA to raise the sunken Soviet submarine &quot;K-129&quot; using the Glomar Explorer, a ship purpose-built for the task by Howard Hughes. The operation was known as Project Azorian, and the cover story of seafloor mining of manganese nodules may have served as the impetus to propel other companies to make the attempt.

==Conservation==
The conservation of hydrothermal vents has been the subject of sometimes heated discussion in the oceanographic community for the last 20 years. It has been pointed out that it may be that those causing the most damage to these fairly rare habitats are scientists. There have been attempts to forge agreements over the behaviour of scientists investigating vent sites, but, although there is an agreed code of practice, there is no formal international and legally binding agreement.

Conservation of hydrothermal vent ecosystems after the fact of mining of an active system would depend on the recolonization of chemosynthetic bacteria, and therefore the continuation of the hydrothermal vent fluid as it is the main hydrothermal energy source. It is very difficult to get an idea of the effects of mining on the hydrothermal vent fluid because there have been no large scale studies done. However, there have been studies on the recolonization of these vent ecosystems after volcanic destruction. From these we can develop insight on the potential effects of mining destruction, and have learned it took 3–5 years for bacteria to recolonize the area, and around 10 years for megafauna to return. It was also found that there was a shift in the composition of species in the ecosystem compared to before the destruction, and the presence of immigrant species. Though further research into the effects of sustained seafloor SMS mining on species recolonization is needed.

== Geochronological dating ==
Common methods to find out the ages of hydrothermal vents are to date the sulfide (e.g., pyrite) and sulphate minerals (e.g., baryte). Common dating methods include radiometric dating and electron spin resonance dating. Different dating methods have their own limitations, assumptions and challenges. General challenges include the high purity of extracted minerals required for dating, the age range of each dating method, heating above closure temperatures erasing ages of older minerals, and multiple episodes of mineral formation resulting in a mixture of ages. In environments with multiple phases of mineral formation, generally, electron spin resonance dating gives the average age of the bulk mineral while radiometric dates are biased to the ages of younger phases because of the decay of parent nuclei. These explain why different methods can give different ages to the same sample and why the same hydrothermal chimney can have samples with different ages.

<text>Frank Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Moss (September 23, 1911 – January 29, 2003) was an American lawyer and politician. A Democrat, from 1959 to 1977 he served as a United States Senator from Utah, and is currently the last Democrat to do so.

==Early life and education==
Frank Moss was born in Holladay, a suburb of Salt Lake City, Utah, as the youngest of seven children of James Edward and Maude (née Nixon) Moss. His father, a well-known secondary school educator, was known as the &quot;father of high school athletics&quot; in Utah. In 1929, he graduated from Granite High School, where he had been freshman class president, editor of the school newspaper, two-time state debate champion, and center on the football team.

Moss then attended the University of Utah, where he was a double major in speech and history. During college, he was sophomore class president and coach of the varsity debate team. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1933. The following year, he married Phyllis Hart (the daughter of Charles H. Hart), to whom he remained married until his death in 2003; the couple had one daughter and three sons.

Moss studied at the George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C., where he was an editor of &quot;The George Washington Law Review&quot;. While studying in Washington, he worked at the National Recovery Administration, the Resettlement Administration, and the Farm Credit Administration. He received his Juris Doctor degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1937.

==Early career==
After his admission to the bar, Moss was a member of the legal staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from 1937 to 1939. He then returned to Utah, where he opened a private practice in Salt Lake City and became a law clerk to Utah Supreme Court justice James H. Wolfe. In his first run for public office, he was elected a judge of Salt Lake City&#x27;s Municipal Court in 1940. During World War II, he served with the U.S. Army Air Forces in the judge advocate general&#x27;s department in the European Theater (1942–1945).

Following his military service, Moss returned to Salt Lake City and was re-elected as city judge, serving in that position until his resignation in 1950. He served as county attorney for Salt Lake County from 1950 to 1959. During those years, he practiced law in the firms of Moss &amp; Hyde (1951–1955) and Moss &amp; Cowley (1955–1959). In 1956, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Utah, losing to City Commissioner L.C. Romney.

==U.S. Senate==
In 1958, Moss ran for the U.S. Senate against two-term incumbent Arthur V. Watkins, a close ally of both the Eisenhower administration and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (see also Mormon), and also against J. Bracken Lee, a non-Mormon and former two-term Utah governor (1949–1957), who was running as an independent after losing to Watkins in the Republican primary. The Republican vote was split in the general election, largely over local dissatisfaction with Watkins&#x27;s having chaired the committee that censured Senator Joseph McCarthy, and Moss won election with less than 40 percent of the vote.

Moss was an original sponsor of laws to create Medicaid, a program to cover health care for low income people.

Moss was elected to a second term in 1964, defeating Brigham Young University President Ernest L. Wilkinson. He was elected to a third term in 1970 defeating four-term Congressman Laurence J. Burton. He gained national prominence with regard to environmental, consumer, and health care issues. Moss became an expert on water issues and wrote &quot;The Water Crisis&quot; in 1967. He worked to secure additional national parks for Utah and started important investigations into the care of the elderly in nursing and retirement homes, and into physicians&#x27; abuses of the federal Medicaid program. In 1976, his capacity as chairman of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Long-Term Care, Senator Moss made a first-hand investigation of waste, fraud and mismanagement in the Medicaid program by posing as a patient and visiting the East Harlem Medical Center in New York City. Despite having no complaints of symptoms and having had his health checked by his own physician a month before, Senator Moss &quot;was given a costly series of tests&quot; and then told to come back the next day for more unnecessary tests that were billed to the federal government.

In 1974, Moss joined Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho) to sponsor the first legislation to provide federal funding for hospice care programs. The bill did not have widespread support and was not brought to a vote. Congress finally included a Hospice benefit in Medicare in 1982. In 1976 Moss backed a constitutional amendment overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and outlawing abortion.

Moss chaired the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee where he sponsored a measure, the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1966, requiring detailed labeling on cigarette packages noting the health hazards of smoking and banning tobacco advertising on radio and television. He also sponsored the Consumer Product Warranty and Guarantee Act (known as the Magnuson-Moss Act), the Toy Safety Act, the Product Safety Act, and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. He was also Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences from 1973 to 1977.

Moss ran for a fourth term in 1976 against Republican Orrin Hatch. Among other issues, Hatch criticized Moss&#x27;s 18-year tenure in the Senate, saying &quot;What do you call a Senator who’s served in office for 18 years? You call him home.&quot; Hatch argued that many senators, including Moss, had lost touch with their constituents. Hatch won the election by an unexpectedly wide nine-point margin and proceeded to hold that seat for the next 42 years.

Afterwards, Moss returned to the practice of law in Washington, D.C. and Salt Lake City. To date, he is the last Democrat to represent Utah in the U.S. Senate.

<text>In mathematics, an affine representation of a topological Lie group &quot;G&quot; on an affine space &quot;A&quot; is a continuous (smooth) group homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to the automorphism group of &quot;A&quot;, the affine group Aff(&quot;A&quot;). Similarly, an affine representation of a Lie algebra g on &quot;A&quot; is a Lie algebra homomorphism from g to the Lie algebra aff(&quot;A&quot;) of the affine group of &quot;A&quot;.

An example is the action of the Euclidean group E(&quot;n&quot;) on the Euclidean space E&quot;n&quot;.

Since the affine group in dimension &quot;n&quot; is a matrix group in dimension &quot;n&quot; + 1, an affine representation may be thought of as a particular kind of linear representation. We may ask whether a given affine representation has a fixed point in the given affine space &quot;A&quot;. If it does, we may take that as origin and regard &quot;A&quot; as a vector space; in that case, we actually have a linear representation in dimension &quot;n&quot;. This reduction depends on a group cohomology question, in general.

<text>Serse (; English title: &quot;Xerxes&quot;; HWV 40) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel. It was first performed in London on 15 April 1738. The Italian libretto was adapted by an unknown hand from that by Silvio Stampiglia (1664–1725) for an earlier opera of the same name by Giovanni Bononcini in 1694. Stampiglia&#x27;s libretto was itself based on one by Nicolò Minato (ca.1627–1698) that was set by Francesco Cavalli in 1654. The opera is set in Persia (modern-day Iran) about 470 BC and is very loosely based upon Xerxes I of Persia. Serse, originally sung by a mezzo-soprano castrato, is now usually performed by a female mezzo-soprano or countertenor.

The opening aria, &quot;Ombra mai fu&quot;, sung by Xerxes to a plane tree (&quot;Platanus orientalis&quot;), is set to one of Handel&#x27;s best-known melodies, and is often known as Handel&#x27;s &quot;Largo&quot; (despite being marked &quot;larghetto&quot; in the score).

==Composition history==
In late 1737 the King&#x27;s Theatre, London, commissioned Handel to write two new operas. The first, &quot;Faramondo&quot;, was premiered on 3 January 1738. By this time, Handel had already begun work on &quot;Serse&quot;. The first act was composed between 26 December 1737 and 9 January 1738, the second was ready by 25 January, the third by 6 February, and Handel put the finishing touches to the score on 14 February. &quot;Serse&quot; was first performed at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Haymarket on 15 April 1738.
The first production was a complete failure. The audience may have been confused by the innovative nature of the work. Unlike his other operas for London, Handel included comic (&quot;buffo&quot;) elements in &quot;Serse&quot;. Although this had been typical for 17th-century Venetian works such as Cavalli&#x27;s original setting of the libretto, by the 1730s an &quot;opera seria&quot; was expected to be wholly serious, with no mixing of the genres of tragedy and comedy or high and low class characters. The musicologist Charles Burney later took &quot;Serse&quot; to task for violating decorum in this way, writing: &quot;I have not been able to discover the author of the words of this drama: but it is one of the worst Handel ever set to Music: for besides feeble writing, there is a mixture of tragic-comedy and buffoonery in it, which Apostolo Zeno and Metastasio had banished from serious opera.&quot; Another unusual aspect of &quot;Serse&quot; is the number of short, one-part arias, when a typical opera seria of Handel&#x27;s time was almost wholly made up of long, three-part da capo arias. This feature particularly struck the Earl of Shaftesbury, who attended the premiere and admired the opera. He noted &quot;the airs too, for brevity&#x27;s sake, as the opera would otherwise be too long [,] fall without any recitativ&#x27; intervening from one into &quot;another&quot;[,] that tis difficult to understand till it comes by frequent hearing to be well known. My own judgment is that it is a capital opera notwithstanding tis called a ballad one.&quot; It is likely that Handel had been influenced, both as regards the comedy and the absence of da capo arias, by the success in London of ballad operas such as &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; and John Frederick Lampe&#x27;s &quot;The Dragon of Wantley&quot;, the latter of which was visited by Handel.
==Performance history==
&quot;Serse&quot; disappeared from the stage for almost two hundred years. It enjoyed its first modern revival in Göttingen on 5 July 1924 in a version by Oskar Hagen. By 1926 this version had been staged at least 90 times in 15 German cities. &quot;Serse&quot;″s success has continued. According to Winton Dean, &quot;Serse&quot; is Handel&#x27;s most popular opera with modern audiences after &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;. The very features which 18th-century listeners found so disconcerting – the shortness of the arias and the admixture of comedy – may account for its appeal to the 20th and the 21st centuries.

&quot;Serse&quot; was produced for the stage at the La Scala Theater in Milan, Italy in January 1962. The production was conducted by Piero Bellugi, and an all-star cast featuring Mirella Freni, Rolando Panerai, Fiorenza Cossotto, Irene Companez, Leonardo Monreale, Franco Calabrese, and Luigi Alva in the title role. Because Handel operas were still in a relatively early stage of their return to the stage, musicians had not yet thought to ornament the da capo sections (repetition of the A section) of the arias and thus, they were not ornamented. A complete recording was made in 1979. A particularly highly acclaimed production, sung in English, was staged by the English National Opera in 1985, to mark the 300th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth. Conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, it was directed by Nicholas Hytner, who also translated the libretto, and starred Ann Murray in the title role, with Valerie Masterson as Romilda, Christopher Robson as Arsamene, and Lesley Garrett as Atalanta. The production returned for a sixth revival to the London Coliseum in September 2014, starring Alice Coote as Xerxes. Hytner&#x27;s production was also performed by San Francisco Opera in 2011. Numerous performances around the world include the Royal Opera of Versailles in 2017, Opernhaus Düsseldorf in 2019 and the Detroit Opera in 2023.

==Roles==


==Synopsis==
:Place: Abydos, Persian Empire
:Time: about 470 BC

===Act 1===
&quot;A garden with a large plane tree and a summerhouse on the side&quot;
The King of Persia, Serse, gives effusive, loving thanks to the plane tree for furnishing him with shade (Arioso: &quot;Ombra mai fu&quot;). His brother Arsamene, with his buffoonish servant Elviro, enters, looking for Arsamene&#x27;s sweetheart Romilda. They stop as they hear her singing from the summerhouse. Romilda is making gentle fun of Serse with her song. He is in love with a tree, but the tree does not return his affection. Serse does not know that his brother is in love with the singer, and entranced by her music, Serse announces that he wants her to be his. Arsamene is horrified when Serse orders him to tell Romilda of his love. Arsamene warns Romilda of what Serse wants — this encourages Atalanta, Romilda&#x27;s sister, who is secretly in love with Arsamene also and hopes that Romilda will be Serse&#x27;s and then she can have Arsamene.

Serse tells Romilda that he wants her for his queen and when Arsamene remonstrates Serse banishes him. Romilda is determined to remain faithful to the man she loves, Arsamene.

&quot;Outside the palace&quot;

Princess Amastre now arrives, disguised as a man. She was engaged to Serse but he jilted her and she is furiously determined to be revenged.

Ariodate, general to Serse and father of Romilda and Atalanta, enters with news of a great military victory he has won. Serse is grateful to him and promises that as a reward his daughter Romilda will marry a man equal in rank to the King himself.

Arsamene gives Elviro a letter for Romilda, telling her how distressed he is at their forced separation and pledging to try to visit her in secret. Romilda&#x27;s sister Atalanta, hoping to secure Arsamene for herself, tells Romilda that Arsamene is in love with another girl, but Romilda does not believe it.

===Act 2===
&quot;A square in the city&quot;

Elviro has disguised himself as a flower-seller in order to deliver his master Arsamene&#x27;s letter to Romilda, and is also putting on a rural accent. He does not approve of the King&#x27;s desire to marry a mere subject such as Romilda and makes this clear. Princess Amastre, in her disguise as a man, hears Elviro expressing this and she is aghast at the King&#x27;s plan to marry another when he promised to be hers (Aria: &quot;Or che siete speranze tradite&quot;).

Amastre leaves in despair and rage and Atalanta enters. Elviro tells her he has a letter for her sister and Atalanta takes it, promising to give it to Romilda. Instead she mischievously shows the letter to the King, telling him that Arsamene sent it to her and no longer loves Romilda. Serse takes the letter and shows it to Romilda, telling her Arsamene is now in love with Atalanta, not her. Romilda is shaken (Aria: &quot;È gelosia&quot;).

Princess Amastre has decided to kill herself but Elviro arrives in time to stop her. She resolves to confront the King with his ill-treatment of her. Elviro tells Amastre that Romilda now loves Serse: Amastre is devastated (Aria: &quot;Anima infida&quot;).

&quot;By the newly-constructed bridge spanning the Hellespont and thus uniting Asia and Europe&quot;

Sailors hail the completion of the bridge, constructed under Serse&#x27;s orders, and Serse orders his general Ariodate to cross the bridge with his army and invade Europe.

Serse encounters his heart-broken brother Arsamene and tells him to cheer up, he can marry the woman he now loves, Atalanta, no problem. Arsamene is confused and insists he loves Romilda, not Atalanta. Hearing this, the King advises Atalanta to forget about Arsamene, but she says that is impossible.

Elviro watches as a violent storm threatens to destroy the new bridge. He calms his nerves with drink.

&quot;Outside the city in a garden&quot;

Serse and Arsamene are both suffering from jealousy and the tribulations of the love lorn. Serse again implores Romilda to marry him but she remains firm in her refusal. The violently furious Amastre appears and draws a sword on the King but Romilda intervenes. Amastre says Romilda should not be forced to marry a man she does not love, and Romilda praises those who are true to their hearts (Aria: &quot;Chi cede al furore&quot;).

===Act 3===
&quot;A gallery&quot;

Romilda and Arsamene are having a lovers&#x27; spat about that letter, but calm down when Atalanta appears and admits her deception. She has decided she will have to find another boyfriend somewhere else.

Serse again implores Romilda to marry him and she tells him to seek her father&#x27;s permission, if he consents, she will. Arsamenes bitterly reproaches her for this (Aria: &quot;Amor, tiranno Amor&quot;).

Serse once more asks Ariodate if he is happy for his daughter Romilda to marry someone equal in rank to the King. Ariodate thinks Serse means Arsamene and happily gives his consent. Serse tells Romilda that her father has agreed to their marriage but Romilda, trying to put him off, tells him that Arsamene loves her and in fact he has kissed her. Serse, furious, orders his brother to be put to death.

Amastre asks Romilda to take a letter to the King, telling her that this will help her. Amastre bewails her plight, having been abandoned by Serse, who promised to be hers (Aria: &quot;Cagion son io&quot;).

Arsamene blames Romilda for the fact that he has been sentenced to death, and the lovers again quarrel (Duet: &quot;Troppo oltraggi la mia fede&quot;).

&quot;The temple of the sun&quot;

Arsamene and Romilda have been summoned to the temple and they come in, still quarreling, but they are amazed and overjoyed when Ariodate tells them that Serse has agreed to their wedding and he marries them then and there.

Serse enters, ready to marry Romilda, and is enraged when he discovers that it is too late, Ariodate has married his daughter to Arsamene. Serse bitterly denounces Ariodate for that and is even more enraged when a letter arrives, apparently from Romilda, accusing him of faithlessness. When he discovers that the letter is actually from his previous fiance Amastre, whom he jilted, his fury only increases (Aria: &quot;Crude furie degl&#x27; orridi abissi&quot;).

Serse takes his sword and orders Arsamene to kill Romilda with it; but Amastre interrupts this and asks Serse if he truly wants treachery and infidelity to be punished. Serse says he does whereupon Amastre reveals her true identity as Serse&#x27;s betrothed. Serse, abashed, admits his fault – he will marry Amastre as he promised, he wishes his brother Arsamene and Romilda happiness in their marriage, and all celebrate the fortunate outcome of events (Chorus: &quot;Ritorna a noi la calma&quot;).

==Historical motives==
The libretto includes some motives that are based upon events that actually happened. Serse, Amastre and Arsamene are all based on historical persons. The story of Xerxes wanting to marry the love of his brother Arsamenes is based upon a real story. In reality though, it was a wife of another brother Xerxes fell in love with but failed to marry himself. The collapsing of a bridge over the Hellespont and Xerxes returning from a catastrophic campaign in Greece are real events during the reign of Xerxes, though they are anachronistic here.

<text>The Carolina mantis (Stagmomantis carolina) is a species of praying mantis of the subfamily Stagmomantinae.

Sexual cannibalism occurs in roughly one quarter of all intersexual encounters of this species, though specimens of this species will engage in cannibalism regardless of age or gender if the opportunity presents itself.

The Carolina mantis is the state insect of South Carolina. Oothecae can be purchased in garden supply centers as a means of biological control of pest insects. However, only those labeled as this species should be released because most oothecae sold in the United States belong to the non-native Chinese mantis.

==Description==
Adult females are in length while adult males are usually about in length. First instar nymphs are in length. When the nymphs eat more, their abdomens get much longer.

The Carolina mantis has a dusty brown, gray or green color useful as camouflage in certain environments. The Carolina mantis&#x27; color varies because the nymphs are able to adjust their color to match the environment they are in at the time of molting. They can adjust their color over each molt, if necessary, until they reach their final molt to adulthood.

An unusual trait is that its wings only extend three-quarters of the way down the abdomen in mature females; this trait is also seen in &quot;Iris oratoria&quot;, which can be distinguished by the large eyespots on the hind wings (inner wings) of both adult male and female &quot;Iris oratoria&quot;. Both adult male and female &quot;Stagmomantis carolina&quot; have a dark-coloured dot on each of their forewings (outer wings), which may be partially hidden in a brown or dark colour morph individual.
==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Stagmomantis carolina&quot; is native to the Americas and can be found from the United States southwards to Brazil.

<text>Mikhail Maratovich Fridman (also transliterated Mikhail Friedman; ; ; born 21 April 1964) is a Ukrainian-born, Russian–Israeli tycoon and oligarch. He is one of the co-founders of Alfa-Group, a multinational Russian conglomerate. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, he was the second-richest Russian as of 2013 ($16.5 billion), moving down to ninth-richest Russian in 2023 ($12.6 billion). In May 2017, he was also ranked as Russia&#x27;s most important businessman by &quot;bne IntelliNews&quot;.
In February 2024, Fridman had a net worth of $13.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

As per Forbes list of The Richest People In The World, dated 6 February 2025 Mikhail Fridman ranked #150 with a net worth of $13.3 Billion.

In 1991, he co-founded Alfa-Bank, one of the largest private banks in Russia. After being CEO of TNK-BP, the 50/50 TNK-BP joint venture, for nine years, in 2013 he sold his stake in the company and co-founded the international investment company LetterOne (L1). Until 2022 Fridman was chairman of the supervisory board of Alfa Group Consortium, and was on the boards of Alfa-Bank and ABH Holdings.

Prior to 2022, he was on the supervisory board of directors for VEON (formerly Vimpelcom) and X5 Retail Group. He is a member of the supervisory board of DEA Deutsche Erdoel AG, which is owned by LetterOne. Fridman has been a member of numerous public-facing bodies, including the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the Public Chamber of Russia, and the Council on Foreign Relations.

In 2022, the EU imposed sanctions on Fridman in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Fridman claimed the EU&#x27;s allegations were false and defamatory. He subsequently decided to step down from the boards of LetterOne and Alfa Group, so that they could avoid sanctions. As reported by several media, Fridman has already filed lawsuits challenging sanctions on at least two occasions, like in July 2022 and in December 2022.

In December 2022, a man reported by Russian state media to be Fridman was arrested in London by the UK&#x27;s National Crime Agency, on charges of money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the Home Office and conspiracy to commit perjury. The UK National Crime Agency did not name the man, stating only that it had detained a 58-year-old &quot;wealthy Russian businessman&quot; at a &quot;multi-million-pound residence&quot;. He was later released on bail. Subsequently, the agency scaled back its probe. In September 2023 the National Crime Agency closed the investigation.

In October 2023, Fridman reportedly announced to return to Russia.

==Early life and education==
Fridman was born in 1964 in Lviv, Ukrainian SSR, USSR, where he spent his youth. He graduated from high school in Lviv in 1980. He says he was denied entrance to Moscow&#x27;s top physics college because he is Jewish, and instead attended the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys. He had various jobs while a college student in Moscow, including washing windows and founding and co-owning a student discothèque named Strawberry Fields. He also led a group of students who would queue for tickets at popular Moscow plays, and then use the tickets as hard currency to barter for rare goods and favours. Having studied metallurgical engineering, he graduated with distinction from the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys in 1986.

==Career==

===Early years and Alfa companies (1980s–1990s)===

After graduation Fridman worked as a metallurgical design engineer at the Elektrostal Metallurgical Works, a state electrical machinery factory, from 1986 to 1988. As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev began to open up the economy in the late 1980s, in 1988 Fridman established a window-washing business, an apartment rental agency for foreigners, a company that sold used computers, and a company that imported cigarettes and perfumes, with fellow friends from college, employing students from various Moscow universities.

Armenian Robert Yengibaryan () provided strong assistance to Fridman and, later, Yengibaryan&#x27;s son Vahe Yengebaryan (), who was the Russian consul in New York from 2003 onwards, became very close to Fridman&#x27;s business interests. In October 2019, Fridman told a Spanish court that he was a friend of Vahe.

In 1988, along with German Khan and Alexey Kuzmichev, Fridman co-founded Alfa-Photo (also transliterated as Alfa-Foto), which imported photography chemicals. In 1989 the three partners founded Alfa-Eco (Alfa-Echo, Alfa-Eko, Alfa-Ekho), a commodities and eventually oil trading firm, and Alfa Capital (Alfa Kapital), an investment firm. Alfa-Eco and Alfa Capital developed into Alfa Group Consortium. The company, which initially focused on computer trading and copy machine maintenance, expanded into imports and exports and commodities trading, eventually becoming one of Russia&#x27;s largest privately owned financial-industrial conglomerates, with interests in industries such as telecommunications, banking, retail, and oil.

Using $100,000 of his profits from his businesses to pay the required fee, in January 1991 Fridman co-founded Alfa-Bank. The company grew to become one of the largest private banks in Russia. Alfa Group&#x27;s later divisions include Rosvodokanal, a private water utility; AlfaStrakhovanie, a diversified insurance company; A1 Group, an investment company; and X5 Retail Group, a large chain of food retailers.

Alfa Group flourished considerably after Fridman recruited Petr Aven, the former Minister of Foreign Economic Relations for the Russian Federation; in 1994 Aven became president and chairman of Alfa-Bank. By late 1996, thanks to the success of Alfa-Bank and Alfa Group, Boris Berezovsky, in an interview by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, named Fridman and Aven among the seven businessman and bankers who controlled most of the economy and media in Russia, and who had helped bankroll Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s 1996 re-election campaign. Both Fridman and Aven were quite close to Berezovsky. In his book &quot;The age of Berezovsky&quot; Aven says: &quot;It was Fridman and I who happened to be by Boris&#x27;s bed after his attempted assassination in 1994, and it was our yacht that he chose to go after being discharged from hospital&quot;.
Fridman and Aven sold off most of their Russian government securities in early August 1998, prior to the ruble crisis of 17 August 1998, and emerged relatively unhurt from the 1998 Russian financial crisis. During the crisis, Alfa-Bank used its holdings related to TNK to avoid a debt default, and was one of the few Russian banks at the time to continue to allow customer withdrawals.

===Retail holdings and X5 Retail (1995 to present)===
Fridman&#x27;s Alfa Group founded the &quot;Perekrestok&quot; (also transliterated &quot;Perekriostok&quot;) chain of supermarkets in Moscow in 1995. Through a merger with the &quot;Pyatyorochka&quot; (also transliterated &quot;Pyaterochka&quot;) supermarket chain, which had been founded in St. Petersburg in 1999 by Alexander Girda and Andrey Rogachev, Alfa Group founded the X5 Retail Group in 2006. X5 acquired another grocer, &quot;Kopeyka&quot;, for $1.65 billion in December 2010. X5 is Russia&#x27;s largest food retailer in terms of sales.

===Alfa Telecom and Altimo (2001–2015)===
Alfa Group acquired a 44% stake in Golden Telecom, a large telecommunications and internet company in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, in 2001. Also in 2001, Alfa purchased a strategic ownership interest in Vimpelcom, a large cellular operator in Russia, and Fridman joined Vimpelcom&#x27;s board of directors.

Alfa Group consolidated its telecom holdings as Alfa Telecom, and in 2005 renamed it Altimo. Its holdings and acquisitions included MegaFon, Vimpelcom, Golden Telecom, and Kyivstar. In December 2005 Altimo also acquired a 13.2% interest in Turkcell, the largest telecoms company in Turkey.
Fridman&#x27;s desire to merge Vimpelcom and Kyivstar was thwarted by his Vimpelcom partner, the Norwegian telecoms group Telenor, which held stakes in both companies. Fridman resorted to protracted and aggressive efforts to strong-arm Telenor in 2005, and although the merger of Vimpelcom and Kyivstar was achieved in 2010, conflicts with Telenor over control of Vimpelcom lasted seven years in total.

From 2003 until 2007 Fridman&#x27;s Altimo was locked in a complex four-year battle of claims and counter-claims of fraud with the Bermuda-based investment firm IPOC International Growth Fund associated with Leonid Reiman and Jeffrey Galmond over ownership of a 25.1% stake in MegaFon that was formerly held by Leonid Rozhetskin&#x27;s LV Finance. James Hatt, a British telecommunications executive, represented Fridman&#x27;s interests while Jeffrey Galmond, a Danish attorney, represented Reiman&#x27;s interests during deliberations between the two groups. Altimo&#x27;s ownership of the stake was finally maintained in 2007. During the dispute in 2005, Altimo hired the Haley Barbour-founded BGR public relations firm, which then hired a security firm, Richard Burt&#x27;s Due Diligence, in order to infiltrate and obtain information about the KPMG independent investigations funded by Paula Cox, who was the Bermuda Minister of Finance, into the IPOC International Growth Fund. Richard Burt and Mikhail Fridman have a strong working relationship.

In 2012 Fridman sold his entire stake in MegaFon for $5 billion.

===TNK-BP (2003–2013)===
In 1997, Fridman had collaborated with Len Blavatnik and Viktor Vekselberg to purchase the state-owned TNK (Tyumen Oil Company), an oil company in Siberia, for $800 million. In February 2003, the British multinational oil and gas company BP agreed to form the TNK-BP joint venture with the AAR (Alfa-Access-Renova) consortium, which included Alfa Group, Blavatnik&#x27;s Access Industries, and Vekselberg&#x27;s Renova. After the merger, TNK-BP became the third largest oil producer in Russia, and one of the top 10 largest private oil companies in the world. Fridman was TNK-BP chairman for nine years, and CEO for three years.

Prior to the TNK-BP joint venture, in 1999 Fridman had thwarted BP by seizing BP&#x27;s stake in the Siberian oil company Sidanko, via bankruptcy maneuvers widely regarded as unfair practices. And although TNK-BP was highly successful financially, Fridman&#x27;s relationship with BP during the TNK-BP years was contentious, and included blocking BP&#x27;s 2011 planned partnership with Rosneft for Arctic oilfield exploration.

He resigned as CEO of TNK-BP in May 2012. In 2013, TNK-BP was sold to Russia&#x27;s state-owned energy group Rosneft for $56 billion, with Fridman and his Russian partners receiving $28 billion for their 50% stake, at the height of crude oil prices.

===Founding LetterOne and L1 Energy (2013–2015)===

Using the proceeds from the sale of their stakes in TNK-BP, Fridman and his Alfa Group partners Khan and Kuzmichev established the international investment company LetterOne (L1) in 2013, and Fridman became the company&#x27;s chairman. LetterOne&#x27;s additional co-founders were Petr Aven and Andrei Kosogov. Headquartered in Luxembourg, the company was created to invest in international projects in energy, telecoms, finance, technology, and other sectors. As of 31 December 2013, LetterOne had $29 billion in assets under management. In May 2015 Mervyn Davies (Lord Davies) was appointed deputy chairman of LetterOne, and former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt was appointed as the board&#x27;s advisor.

In 2013 LetterOne also formed L1 Energy, an energy investment vehicle, initially focused particularly on undervalued international oil and gas assets during the slump in oil prices. John Browne (Lord Browne) was appointed to its advisory board, and in March 2015 became its chairman.

===L1 Energy&#x27;s North Sea oil assets (2015)===
On 3 March 2015, L1 Energy acquired the international oil and gas company DEA from the German utility RWE for $7 billion (€5.1 billion). Headquartered in Hamburg, Germany with extensive assets in the British North Sea, RWE DEA had total natural gas production output of 2.6bn cubic metres in 2013. The purchase was opposed by the UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey, who raised concerns that Fridman might one day face international sanctions due to the Russo-Ukrainian war, which could force L1 Energy to shut down production in the North Sea, thus imperiling oil supplies and 5% of Britain&#x27;s North Sea natural gas output. On 4 March 2015, Davey gave Fridman a one-week deadline to convince the UK government not to force him to sell the North Sea oil and gas assets. In April 2015, the government gave Fridman up to six months to sell.

In October 2015 Fridman and the LetterOne Group sold L1 Energy&#x27;s British North Sea assets to Ineos, a Switzerland-based petrochemical company owned by Jim Ratcliffe, for $750 million. The British government assured LetterOne that the forced sale was &quot;not a judgement on the suitability of LetterOne&#x27;s owners to control these or any other assets in the UK&quot;.

In October 2015 LetterOne Group acquired German utility company E.ON&#x27;s equity interests in 43 Norwegian oil and gas licences, including interests in three producing Norwegian fields, all located in the North Sea, for $1.6 billion.

===LetterOne&#x27;s telecom and other technology assets 2015 to present===
In April 2015, LetterOne Technology (L1 Technology) was launched in London. Its focus was on buying &quot;struggling telecom or technology companies that require a fresh infusion of capital&quot;. Various advisory board members were appointed including Brent Hoberman, Denis O&#x27;Brien, and Sir Julian Horn-Smith.

The L1 Technology fund began acting as a holding company for the 48 percent stake in Vimpelcom owned by Fridman and his partners. The fund also has a 13.2% share in the Turkish telecom company Turkcell, which since 2005 has been hampered by a long-running feud between its three largest shareholders: Cukurova, owned by Turkcell founder Mehmet Emin Karamehmet, Fridman&#x27;s LetterOne via Alfa Telecom/Altimo, and Sweden&#x27;s Telia Company.

In February 2016, Vimpelcom agreed to pay $800 million to settle U.S. and Dutch claims that it had bribed officials to win contracts in Uzbekistan between 2006 and 2012. A year later the company rebranded itself VEON, and changed its focus to mobile internet services such as banking, taxis, and messaging.

In February 2016, Fridman&#x27;s LetterOne fund invested $200 million in Uber. In August 2016 LetterOne invested $50 million in telecommunications start-up FreedomPop, to help finance its international expansion.

===Additional activities 2012 to present===
In 2012 Fridman partnered with American real-estate developer Jack Rosen in a joint venture to invest $1 billion in distressed real estate properties along the U.S. East Coast.

In June 2016, LetterOne prepared to expand into healthcare by launching the $3 billion fund L1 Health in the United States, for investments in the global healthcare industry.

In October 2016, Alfa Group acquired Ukrainian bank Ukrsotsbank, by offering its parent, the Italian financial conglomerate UniCredit Group, a minority stake of 9.9% in ABH Holdings.

In December 2016, LetterOne launched L1 Retail, headquartered in London, to invest $3 billion in &quot;the retail stars of tomorrow&quot; in Europe and the UK.

In 2016 Fridman coined the term &quot;Indigo Era&quot;, for his theory of a global shift to an emerging era of economics based on creativity and digital skills rather than on natural resources. In 2017 he funded a £100,000 Indigo Prize for new economic-measurement models based on the paradigm.
In June 2017 LetterOne&#x27;s L1 Retail division acquired Holland &amp; Barrett, Europe&#x27;s largest health-food store chain, for £1.8 billion ($2.3 billion). Also in 2017 Fridman, via LetterOne, invested $3 billion in Pamplona Capital Management, a private-equity firm that was founded by Alexander Knaster, the former CEO of Alfa-Bank, and which Fridman had invested in previously.

In January 2018, due to concerns over possible sanctions stemming from the 2017 U.S. Congressional sanctions on Russia, Fridman announced that Alfa-Bank was phasing out its holdings in Russia&#x27;s defense industry.

In May 2018 Fridman and Aven spoke to an off-the-record private dinner at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C. The invitation and the privacy of the meeting drew criticism of the Atlantic Council from a group of 13 Russian and U.S. experts and activists, who wrote that &quot;In our view ... Aven, Fridman, and other key Alfa-Bank oligarchs are ... close cronies and insiders of Putin&#x27;s regime, and do not operate independently of Putin&#x27;s demands.&quot; The Atlantic Council responded that the private meeting was not &quot;a sweetheart platform&quot;, and the Kremlin responded that the two oligarchs represented the interests of their business.

In 2019, Mikhail Fridman acquired a 50% stake in one of the suppliers of computing devices for the Russian defense industry via the structures affiliated with A1 investment company.

===Sanctions===
On 28 February 2022, the European Union blacklisted Fridman and had all his assets frozen as part of a package of sanctions imposed against Russian officials and oligarchs in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Fridman said that the war would &quot;damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years&quot; and called for the &quot;bloodshed to end&quot;.
 The United Kingdom also sanctioned Fridman on 15 March 2022.

In October 2022 Fridman offered to transfer $1 billion of his personal wealth into the Ukrainian Sense Bank that he co-founded. Officials said the proposal was calculated to persuade the UK to lift sanctions against him. Fridman denied making a quid pro quo offer to Ukraine. Following the invasion of Ukraine Sense Bank transferred millions of its own budget to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and territorial defense units. Fridman was sanctioned by the UK government in 2022 in relation to the invasion.

In September 2023 the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation HM Treasury (UK) updated the text of the financial sanctions notice related to Mikhail Fridman. He is now referred to as &quot;an involved person under the Russia regulations&quot; instead of &quot;a prominent Russian businessman and pro-Kremlin oligarch&quot;. Additionally, a phrase alleging close ties between Mikhail Fridman and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been deleted from the document.

On 5 September 2023, the Security Service of Ukraine announced in absentia that Fridman was suspected of violating Article 110 of the Criminal Code, which provides for liability for financing actions to seize power, overthrow the constitutional order, or change the territory of the state. Under this article, he could face up to 8 years in prison with confiscation of property. The SSU believes that since the start of the conflict, the banker has invested about 2 billion rubles in Russian defense enterprises, in particular, in the Tula Cartridge Plant.

In April 2024, following a legal challenge, The General Court of the European Union took Fridman off the EU sanctions list.

In May 2024, Fridman sued the Luxembourg government, becoming the first Russian billionaire to challenge European sanctions and demand compensation for his frozen assets. In August 2024, Fridman, after loss of trial in Luxembourg, started arbitration dispute with Luxembourg at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC).

== Controversy in Spain ==
Fridman first appeared in the Spanish press in November 2002, when the Liberian tanker &quot;Prestige&quot; sank off the coast of Galicia. It was transferring 77,000 tons of Russian heavy oil; the cargo belonged to Crown Resources, a company owned by Fridman&#x27;s Alfa Group. The oil spill contaminated the Spanish coast, causing a major environmental disaster, with total damage estimated at 1.5 billion euros. After the disaster, the Spanish newspaper El Mundo called Fridman ‘Dirty Michael’.

In the summer of 2016, the Spanish entrepreneur Javier Perez Dolset, head of the ZED Corporation (mobile apps developer), addressed the Spanish prosecutor&#x27;s office with a complaint about his Russian partners associated with VimpelCom Ltd. According to Dolset, they had illegally seized the capital of their joint venture, which resulted in the bankruptcy of the parent company. El Confidencial published a series of articles about the story of ZED&#x27;s bankruptcy, and accused Fridman of staging an illegal takeover by removing Javier Perez Dolset from the business and ruining him financially.

On 16 January 2017, Peter Wakkie, a Dutch attorney known as Fridman&#x27;s righthand man, was arrested at Madrid&#x27;s Barajas Airport for possible business fraud.

In October 2019, Fridman attended court proceedings relating to the Zed case in order to be questioned by Spain&#x27;s National Court in Madrid. He was summoned to a pre-trial hearing as a person under investigation. The accusation was formulated as “a series of actions which brought about the insolvency of Spanish firm Zed Worldwide… in order to acquire it at a derisory price, far lower than its market value.” The prosecutor referred to Fridman&#x27;s dealings with Zed Worldwide as a &#x27;raid&#x27;, clarifying that this was a technique used “typically used by the Russian mafia” with the purpose of taking over a business illegally. And while his legal representatives claimed that Fridman had never been a director of any entities involved in Zed&#x27;s takeover or driving down Zed&#x27;s market value, the Spanish prosecutors insisted that Fridman “hides his control of criminal activities behind subordinates.” After the pre-trial hearing, Jose Grinda, who was the lead prosecutor in the case, commented to the media that “from the perspective of the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, Fridman will remain in the status of the accused.” On 15 December 2020 the Spanish National Court dismissed the case. According to the decision, the judge considered that the continuation of the case against Fridman contradicted the principle of the presumption of innocence and stated that there were &quot;no reasonable grounds to accuse the suspect as an author, accomplice or accessory.&quot; Subsequently, in an order dated 22 February 2021, the National High Court of Spain dismissed appeals by Zed Group in Fridman&#x27;s favor, concluding there was no evidence to demonstrate that Zed Group&#x27;s allegations were true, and that the text messages originally used as evidence failed to implicate Fridman &quot;beyond references from third parties.&quot;

In mid-2017, Fridman&#x27;s LetterOne investment company acquired Dia, a Spanish supermarket chain. From 2011 to 20 December 2018, Dia was listed in the so-called IBEX 35 as one of the 35 largest Spanish companies on the stock market. Economy expert Sergio Avila commented: “... With the entry of [LetterOne] into [Dia] the sales fell sharply, the profitability of enterprises decreased, which was accompanied by a fall in Dia&#x27;s share prices on the Madrid Stock Exchange. Therefore, I assess Dia&#x27;s prospects as extremely negative, and in no way recommend it to investors.” El Confidencial recalled past episodes associated with Fridman and qualified his actions as raider attacks on Spanish enterprises. In January 2021, the Spanish National Court dismissed a case alleging that Fridman had manipulated the market to devalue Dia&#x27;s shares, with the judge stating the court instead saw Dia&#x27;s decline in value as a result of &quot;mismanagement&quot; and lack of investments in marketing.

==Current posts==
Fridman is on the board of directors of ABH Holdings, which is the Luxembourg-headquartered holding company of Alfa Banking Group. Since DEA Deutsche Erdoel AG was bought by L1 Energy in 2015, he has been a member of its supervisory board.

Fridman is a member of numerous public-facing bodies, including the National Council on Corporate Governance in Russia and a boardmember of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In February 2001, he became a member of the Council for Entrepreneurship at the Government of the Russian Federation. He was elected as a member of the Public Chamber of Russia in November 2005. Since 2005, he has been a Russian representative on the international advisory board of the Council on Foreign Relations.

==Philanthropy and initiatives==

In 1996 Fridman was one of the founders of the Russian Jewish Congress, and he has been an active member since then, including having been its vice president and head of its cultural committee. He is a major donor to the European Jewish Fund, which promotes inter-religious dialogue. In 2007, Fridman, along with Stan Polovets, Alexander Knaster, Petr Aven, and German Khan, founded the Genesis Philanthropy Group, whose purpose is to develop and enhance Jewish identity among Russian-speaking Jews worldwide. The Genesis Prize, which the group founded in 2012, is a million-dollar annual prize for Jewish contributions to humanity. Fridman was also one of the major funders of the Holocaust memorial project at Babi Yar in Kyiv, Ukraine, which was launched in 2016.

In 2011 he founded the annual Alfa Jazz Fest, which is funded by Alfa-Bank, in his place of birth Lviv, Ukraine, and in 2014 launched the Alfa Future People Festival, an annual electronic music festival held on the banks of the Volga River in the Nizhny Novgorod region in Russia.

==Honours and awards==
In 2003, Fridman received the Golden Plate Award from the Academy of Achievement in Washington, presented by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, and he was named one of &quot;The Stars of Europe: 25 Leaders at the forefront of change&quot; by &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;. In 2004 he was included in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; list of 25 business executives named &quot;Leaders of the New Europe&quot;. In 2004 he was included in Fortune magazine&#x27;s list of the Power 25 in Europe and was given GQ Russia&#x27;s Man of the Year national award in 2006. &quot;Forbes Russia&quot; named Fridman Russian Businessman of the Year in 2012 and 2017.

==Legal challenges==
In 2003, two &quot;elite dachas&quot; owned by the Russian government were sold below market value, one to Fridman and another to former Russian prime-minister Mikhail Kasyanov. The sales caught the attention of the press in July 2005, with State Duma member and journalist Aleksandr Khinshtein stating that the sales had gone through without the mandatory media announcement of auction. Khinshtein also alleged a preferential loan from Fridman to Kasyanov, which Fridman denied. Fridman stated that the property&#x27;s asking price was low because the building was dilapidated and sold without land. &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot; reported that Khinshtein&#x27;s investigation appeared to be an attempt to intimidate Kasyanov, who aspired to head anti-Putin forces. In early 2006, the Moscow Court of Arbitration ruled that the two houses should be returned to the state, maintaining Fridman&#x27;s right to a refund but arguing the proper procedures were not followed during the privatization. On 1 March 2006, government officials responsible for the sale of the two properties were charged with misappropriation of entrusted property for an especially large sum by an organized group.

In 2005, a United States district court in Washington, D.C. dismissed a 2000 libel suit by Fridman and Petr Aven against the Center for Public Integrity over an online article which included a suggestion that they had been involved in drug-running and organized crime; the federal judge ruled that there was no evidence of actual malice on the part of the publication and that Fridman and Aven were limited public figures regarding the public controversy involving corruption in post-Soviet Russia.

In May 2017 Fridman, along with fellow Alfa-Bank owners Petr Aven and German Khan, filed a defamation lawsuit against &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; for publishing the unverified Steele dossier, which alleged financial ties and collusion between Putin, Trump, and the three bank owners. In October 2017 Fridman, Aven, and Khan also filed a libel suit against the private-investigation firm Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson, who had commissioned former MI6 agent Christopher Steele to compile the dossier, for circulating the dossier among journalists and allowing it to be published. In April 2018 Fridman, Aven, and Khan filed a libel suit against Steele in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, but the suit was dismissed with prejudice the following August. Aven, Khan, and Fridman then brought a lawsuit for defamation in Britain against Orbis Business Intelligence, Steele&#x27;s private intelligence firm. The trial started in March 2020 in London, with Steele arguing the claim should be dismissed as the subject matter &quot;fell within the remit of national security&quot;. In July 2020, Mr. Justice Mark Warby in the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division of the British High Court of Justice ordered Orbis pay $23,000 to both Fridman and Aven in damages, after Steele claimed they had delivered &quot;large amounts of illicit cash&quot; to Vladimir Putin when Putin was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. Warby stated that the claim was &quot;demonstrably false&quot; and awarded the damages to compensate &quot;for the loss of autonomy, distress and reputational damage caused by the breaches of duty&quot;. The judge also stated that Steele&#x27;s dossier inaccurately claimed that Aven and Fridman provided foreign policy advice to Putin. Fridman testified in the proceedings that he had never been asked by Putin to perform political favors, with Warby agreeing that &quot;in the context of his position as a businessman, the idea of [Fridman] doing Mr Putin&#x27;s political bidding makes no sense.&quot;

==Alleged arrest in London==
On 1 December 2022, an unnamed 58-year-old man was arrested at his residence in London and later released on bail by officers from the Combatting Kleptocracy Cell, established by the UK’s National Crime Agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCA_12/27/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several media, such as the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, alleged the man was Mikhail Fridman. Alfa-Bank denied that Fridman was the man in question. The Russian Embassy in London, meanwhile, stated that Fridman had not asked for consular assistance Later, in September 2023, the National Crime Agency closed the investigation. An NCA spokesman said that the agency would take no further action against Fridman based on the warrant executed at Athlone House in December 2022.

==Personal life==
Fridman was based for many years in Moscow, often spending time in European cities such as London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. In 2015 he moved to London, and by 2016 had purchased Athlone House for £65 million to be his primary residence. He is divorced and has four children. In 2016 Fridman announced that by virtue of his will, his entire fortune will be left to charity.

Fridman and his first wife Olga have two daughters Katya (Ekaterina) and Lora (Larisa) (). Olga studied with Mikhail at the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys, but in the 1990s she attended design courses in Paris and became an interior designer. As of May 2014, she and the daughters live in France. Fridman has two children with his second wife Oksana Ozhelskaya ().

<text>Gustav Albert Lortzing (23 October 1801 – 21 January 1851) was a German composer, librettist, actor and singer. He is considered to be the main representative of the German &quot;Spieloper&quot;, a form similar to the French &quot;opéra comique&quot;, which grew out of the &quot;Singspiel&quot;.

==Life and career==
Lortzing was born in Berlin to Johann Gottlieb and Charlotte Sophie Lortzing. They had abandoned their leather shop and travelled through Germany as itinerant actors, founding the Berlin theatre company &quot;Urania&quot;, and turning their amateur passion into a profession. The young Lortzing&#x27;s first stage appearance was at the age of 12, entertaining the audience with comic poems during the interval in the &quot;Kornhaus&quot; at the Freiburg Münster. From 1817, the Lortzing family were part of Josef Derossi ensemble in the Rhineland, treading the boards at Bonn, Düsseldorf, Barmen and Aachen. Albert Lortzing became an audience favourite, playing the roles of a youthful lover, a country boy and bon vivant, sometimes also singing small tenor or baritone roles.

On 30 January 1824 he married the actress Rosina Regine Ahles, with whom he subsequently had 11 children. The couple belonged to the Hoftheater (court theatre) in Detmold from late 1826, which toured to Münster and Osnabrück. Lortzing joined the Freemasons, a popular refuge for artists in Metternich&#x27;s police state. Lortzing composed an oratorio in Detmold, &quot;Die Himmelfahrt Christi&quot; (&quot;Christ&#x27;s Ascension&quot;), which premiered in Münster, and predictably earned a rebuke for the young composer from the Münster regional governor, who claimed that Lortzing was &quot;a composer of no renown&quot;.

Lortzing composed the music for Christian Dietrich Grabbe&#x27;s Don Juan und Faust, playing the role of Don Juan himself, with his wife as Donna Anna. Lortzing received a glowing report from an anonymous reviewer in a Frankfurt paper, who also mistakenly praised Lortzing for the text &quot;by this brilliant poet&quot;. Grabbe, the real poet, was outraged, although the review did bring good publicity for the piece.
On 3 November 1833 the young Lortzings gave their debut at the Leipziger Stadttheater. Lortzing&#x27;s parents had been members of this ensemble since 1832, under Friedrich Sebald Ringelhardt. Here, Lortzing became a member of the artists&#x27; club &quot;Tunnel unter der Pleisse&quot; (&quot;Tunnel under the Pleiße&quot;), and in 1834 he became a member of the Leipzig Freemasons lodge &quot;Balduin zur Linde&quot; (&quot;Balduin to the Linden Tree&quot;). Lortzing was much loved in the Leipzig ensemble, particularly when acting in Johann Nestroy&#x27;s comedies. However, his tendency to improvise and to deviate from the script attracted the attention of the theatrical police.

His first comic opera, &quot;Zar und Zimmermann&quot;, had a tough time with the Leipzig censors. It premiered in Leipzig on 22 December 1837. Lortzing himself sang the role of Peter Iwanow, but it did not make a major breakthrough until its Berlin performances in 1839, where it was much praised.

In 1844, Lortzing became Kapellmeister of the Leipzig Stadttheater. After a quarrel with management, he was dismissed in April 1845 due to his &quot;rheumatic troubles&quot;. The repeated protests of the public got him reinstated, but he was soon dismissed again after another argument. In an open letter, signed by almost everyone in the ensemble, he made a plea against the measures taken by the city government.

Between 1846 and 1848, Lortzing worked as Kapellmeister at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna. At the behest of the Freedom Movement, he wrote text and music in 1848 for his political opera &quot;Regina&quot;, named after his wife. This work concerned both labour struggles and fear of suicide. His last full-length opera was an 1849 fairy-tale satire of the Prussian military state called &quot;Rolands Knappen&quot; (&quot;Roland&#x27;s Squires&quot;), featuring the repeated line &quot;And this is supposed to be a world order?&quot; (&quot;Und das soll eine Weltordnung sein?&quot;)

In 1848 he lost his appointment and had to return to work as a touring actor to support his large family. He worked at Gera and Lüneburg, among other cities. Finally in 1850, he became the Kapellmeister in Berlin at the newly opened Friedrich-Wilhelmstädtisches Theater.

Lortzing also wrote music for masonic rituals.

On 20 January 1851, the night his musical comedy &quot;Die Opernprobe&quot; premiered in Frankfurt, Lortzing suffered a stroke at his home in Berlin and died without medical treatment on the morning of the following day, under huge stress and deeply in debt. A number of luminaries from the musical world were present at his funeral, including Giacomo Meyerbeer, Heinrich Dorn, Wilhelm Taubert and Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen. Lortzing&#x27;s theatrical colleagues decorated his coffin with black, red and gold, a combination forbidden after 1848. A public benefit was then later held for his already impoverished family.

==Works==
His first singspiel, &quot;Ali Pascha von Janina&quot;, appeared in 1824, but his fame as a musician rests chiefly upon the two operas &quot;Zar und Zimmermann&quot; (1837) and &quot;Der Wildschütz&quot; (1842).

&quot;Zar und Zimmermann&quot; was received with very little enthusiasm by the public of Leipzig. However, at subsequent performances in Berlin there was a much more positive reaction. The opera soon appeared on all the stages of Germany, and today is regarded as one of the masterpieces of German comic opera. It was translated into English, French, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Bohemian, Hungarian and Russian. The story is based around Tsar Peter I &#x27;The Great&#x27; of Russia, who travelled to Germany, Holland and England disguised as a carpenter in order to gain first-hand technical knowledge he believed necessary for his country&#x27;s economic progress, such as modern shipbuilding.

&quot;Der Wildschütz&quot; was based on a comedy by August von Kotzebue, and was a satire on the unintelligent and exaggerated admiration for the highest beauty in art expressed by the bourgeois gentilhomme.
Of his other operas, &quot;Der Pole und sein Kind&quot;, produced shortly after the Polish insurrection of 1831, and &quot;Undine&quot; (1845) are notable. His &quot;Hans Sachs&quot; (on a subject later used by Wagner) was revived in 2024 in the city where it received its first performance, at the Musikalische Komödie Leipzig.

Lortzing was popular in Berlin and after his death, a memorial statue was erected in the Tiergarten in Berlin.

<text>In chemistry, a suspension is a heterogeneous mixture of a fluid that contains solid particles sufficiently large for sedimentation. The particles may be visible to the naked eye, usually must be larger than one micrometer, and will eventually settle, although the mixture is only classified as a suspension when and while the particles have not settled out.

==Properties==
A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solid particles do not dissolve, but get suspended throughout the bulk of the solvent, left floating around freely in the medium. The internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents.

An example of a suspension would be sand in water. The suspended particles are visible under a microscope and will settle over time if left undisturbed. This distinguishes a suspension from a colloid, in which the colloid particles are smaller and do not settle. Colloids and suspensions are different from solution, in which the dissolved substance (solute) does not exist as a solid, and solvent and solute are homogeneously mixed.
A suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas is called an aerosol. In the atmosphere, the suspended particles are called particulates and consist of fine dust and soot particles, sea salt, biogenic and volcanogenic sulfates, nitrates, and cloud droplets.
Suspensions are classified on the basis of the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, where the former is essentially solid while the latter may either be a solid, a liquid, or a gas.
In modern chemical process industries, high-shear mixing technology has been used to create many novel suspensions.
Suspensions are unstable from a thermodynamic point of view but can be kinetically stable over a longer period of time, which in turn can determine a suspension&#x27;s shelf life. This time span needs to be measured in order to provide accurate information to the consumer and ensure the best product quality.

&quot;Dispersion stability refers to the ability of a dispersion to resist change in its properties over time.&quot;


==Technique monitoring physical stability==
Multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning is the most widely used technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product, hence identifying and quantifying destabilization phenomena. It works on concentrated dispersions without dilution. When light is sent through the sample, it is back scattered by the particles. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (sedimentation) and global changes in size (flocculation, aggregation) are detected and monitored. Of primary importance in the analysis of stability in particle suspensions is the value of the zeta potential exhibited by suspended solids. This parameter indicates the magnitude of interparticle electrostatic repulsion and is commonly analyzed to determine how the use of adsorbates and pH modification affect particle repulsion and suspension stabilization or destabilization.

==Accelerating methods for shelf life prediction==
The kinetic process of destabilisation can be rather long (up to several months or even years for some products) and it is often required for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase and degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables simulation of real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times including vibration, centrifugation and agitation are sometimes used. They subject the product to different forces that pushes the particles / film drainage. However, some emulsions would never coalesce in normal gravity, while they do under artificial gravity. Moreover, segregation of different populations of particles have been highlighted when using centrifugation and vibration.

==Examples==
Common examples of suspensions include:
*Mud or muddy water: where soil, clay, or silt particles are suspended in water.
*Flour suspended in water.
*Kimchi suspended on vinegar.
*Chalk suspended in water.
*Sand suspended in water.

<text>Euphorbia virosa, the Gifboom or poison tree, is a plant of the spurge family Euphorbiaceae. It has a short main stem, usually twisted, from which 5–10 cm branches emerge. These leafless branches have 5 to 8 edges. Paired thorns grow in regularly spaced intervals from the edges.

&quot;Euphorbia virosa&quot; is commonly distributed from the Orange River in South Africa to Southern Angola, and occurs throughout the Namib Desert, mainly on rocky slopes. The plant contains within the branches a milky and creamy substance with carcinogenic properties. This substance is very poisonous and is used by San (Bushmen) to dip the tips of their hunting arrows. Contact with it causes skin irritation, and if the eyes are afflicted, blindness may occur.

<doc id="354620" wikidata="Q17578116" url="?curid=354620" title="Interior minister">
<text>An interior minister (sometimes called a minister of internal affairs or minister of home affairs) is a cabinet official position that is responsible for internal affairs, such as public security, civil registration and identification, emergency management, supervision of regional and local governments, conduct of elections, public administration and immigration (including passport issuance) matters. This position is head of a department that is often called an interior ministry, a ministry of internal affairs or a ministry of home affairs. In some jurisdictions, there is no department called an &quot;interior ministry&quot;, but the relevant responsibilities are allocated to other departments.

== Remit and role ==
In some countries, the public security portfolio belongs to a separate ministry (under a title like &quot;ministry of public order&quot; or &quot;ministry of security&quot;), with the interior ministry being limited to control over local governments, public administration, elections and similar matters. Notable examples include Greece (Ministry of Citizen Protection) and Israel (Ministry of Public Security). In some jurisdictions, matters relating to the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice are the responsibility of a separate justice ministry.

In countries with a federal constitution, interior ministers will often be found at both the federal and sub-national levels. Similarly, autonomous entities and dependent territories may also have interior ministers.

== By country ==

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the position of Secretary of State for the Home Department, normally referred to as the &quot;Home Secretary&quot;, was created in the British governmental reorganisation of 1782.

=== United States ===
The United States Department of the Interior has responsibilities different from similarly named departments elsewhere, primarily the management and conservation of natural resources, and programs and policies dealing with Indigenous peoples. The functions that fall under what most other countries call an &quot;interior ministry&quot; come under other government departments—mostly the Department of Homeland Security (established in 2002 with functions such as immigration management, public safety and disaster relief), with some others falling under the Department of Justice (with functions such as handling the national police and the management of prisons) and individual state governments (e.g. election management).

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the post of Minister of the Interior existed from 1873 to 1936, replacing the previous role of the Secretary of State for the Provinces; it included functions similar to the US Department of the Interior. After 1936 the post was abolished, its responsibilities being transferred to other departments.

=== Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, the Secretary for Home Affairs is responsible for matters relating to communities, culture, sports and local governance. Policing and related matters are the responsibilities of the Secretary for Security.

=== India ===
The Ministry of Home Affairs in India (MHA) is responsible for internal security and demographics, promoting the official languages. It carries out specialized functions through its departments, namely the Department of Border Management, the Department of Internal Security, the Department of Jammu &amp; Kashmir Affairs, the Department of Home, the Department of Official Language and the Department of States. As such it heads such functions as the internal intelligence, and police and Civil Services of India, also handling protocol, freedom-fighter pensions and manning of the courts.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, law enforcement is decentralised with the National Public Safety Commission coordinating between the National Police Agency and the government through its chairman, who is a cabinet member. National security and immigration matters fall under the Ministry of Justice, whilst the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications handles the administrative system, local government, elections, telecommunication and post matters.

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, the Ministry of Public Security is responsible for policing, national security, and immigration matters.

<doc id="354628" wikidata="Q611011" url="?curid=354628" title="History of mental disorders">
<text>Historically, mental disorders have had three major explanations, namely, the supernatural, biological and psychological models. For much of recorded history, deviant behavior has been considered supernatural and a reflection of the battle between good and evil. When confronted with unexplainable, irrational behavior and by suffering and upheaval, people have perceived evil. In fact, in the Persian Empire from 550 to 330 B.C.E., all physical and mental disorders were considered the work of the devil. Physical causes of mental disorders have been sought in history. Hippocrates was important in this tradition as he identified syphilis as a disease and was, therefore, an early proponent of the idea that psychological disorders are biologically caused. This was a precursor to modern psycho-social treatment approaches to the causation of psychopathology, with the focus on psychological, social and cultural factors. Well known philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, etc., wrote about the importance of fantasies, dreams, and thus anticipated, to some extent, the fields of psychoanalytic thought and cognitive science that were later developed. They were also some of the first to advocate for humane and responsible care for individuals with psychological disturbances.

==Ancient period==
There is archaeological evidence for the use of trepanation in around 6500 BC, though it is unknown if this was done as a response to mental illnesses, or to treat physiological conditions such as cranial hemorrhaging.

===Mesopotamia===
Mental illnesses were well known in ancient Mesopotamia, where diseases and mental disorders were believed to be caused by specific deities. Because hands symbolized control over a person, mental illnesses were known as &quot;hands&quot; of certain deities. One psychological illness was known as &quot;Qāt Ištar&quot;, meaning &quot;Hand of Ishtar&quot;. Others were known as &quot;Hand of Shamash&quot;, &quot;Hand of the Ghost&quot;, and &quot;Hand of the God&quot;. Descriptions of these illnesses, however, are so vague that it is usually impossible to determine which illnesses they correspond to in modern terminology. Mesopotamian doctors kept detailed record of their patients&#x27; hallucinations and assigned spiritual meanings to them. A patient who hallucinated that he was seeing a dog was predicted to die; whereas, if he saw a gazelle, he would recover. The royal family of Elam was notorious for its members frequently being insane. Erectile dysfunction was recognized as being rooted in psychological problems.

===Egypt===
Limited notes in an ancient Egyptian document known as the Ebers papyrus appear to describe the affected states of concentration, attention, and emotional distress in the heart or mind. Some of these were interpreted later, and renamed as hysteria and melancholy. Somatic treatments included applying bodily fluids while reciting magical spells. Hallucinogens may have been used as a part of the healing rituals. Religious temples may have been used as therapeutic retreats, possibly for the induction of receptive states to facilitate sleep and the interpretation of dreams.

===India===

Ancient Hindu scriptures-Ramayana and Mahabharata-contain fictional descriptions of depression and anxiety. Mental disorders were generally thought to reflect abstract metaphysical entities, supernatural agents, sorcery and witchcraft. The Charaka Samhita which is a part of the Hindu Ayurveda (&quot;knowledge of life&quot;), saw ill health as resulting from an imbalance among the three body fluids or forces called Tri-Dosha. These also affected the personality types among people. Suggested causes included inappropriate diet, disrespect towards the gods, teachers or others, mental shock due to excessive fear or joy, and faulty bodily activity. Treatments included the use of herbs and ointments, charms and prayers, and moral or emotional persuasion. In the Hindu epic Ramayana, the Dasharatha died from despondency, which Shiv Gautam states illustrates major depressive disorder.

===China===
The earliest known record of mental illness in ancient China dates back to 1100 B.C. Mental disorders were treated mainly under Traditional Chinese medicine using herbs, acupuncture or &quot;emotional therapy&quot;. The Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor described symptoms, mechanisms and therapies for mental illness, emphasizing connections between bodily organs and emotions. The ancient Chinese believed that demonic possession played a role in mental illness during this time period. They felt that areas of emotional outbursts, such as funeral homes, could open up the Wei Chi and allow entities to possess an individual. Trauma was also considered to be something that caused high levels of emotion. Thus, trauma is a possible catalyst for mental illness due to its ability to allow the Wei Chi open to possession. This explains why the ancient Chinese believed that a mental illness was, in reality, a demonic possession. According to Chinese thought, five stages or elements comprised the conditions of imbalance between yin and yang. Mental illness, according to the Chinese perspective, is thus considered an imbalance of the yin and yang because optimum health arises from balance with nature.

China was one of the earliest developed civilizations in which medicine and attention to mental disorders were introduced (Soong, 2006). As in the West, Chinese views of mental disorders regressed to a belief in supernatural forces as causal agents. From the later part of the second century through the early part of the ninth century, ghosts and devils were implicated in &quot;ghostevil&quot; insanity, which presumably resulted from possession by evil spirits. The &quot;Dark Ages&quot; in China, however, were neither so severe (in terms of the treatment of mental patients) nor as long-lasting as in the West. A return to biological, somatic (bodily) views and an emphasis on psychosocial factors occurred in the centuries that followed. In recent history, China has been experiencing a broadening of ideas in mental health services and has been incorporating many ideas from Western psychiatry (Zhang &amp; Lu, 2006).

===Greece and Rome===
In ancient Greece and Rome, madness was associated stereotypically with aimless wandering and violence. However, Socrates considered positive aspects including prophesying (a &#x27;manic art&#x27;); mystical initiations and rituals; poetic inspiration; and the madness of lovers. Now often seen as the very epitome of rational thought and as the founder of philosophy, Socrates freely admitted to experiencing what are now called &quot;command hallucinations&quot; (then called his &#x27;daemon&#x27;). Pythagoras also heard voices. Hippocrates (470–) classified mental disorders, including paranoia, epilepsy, mania and melancholia. Hippocrates mentions the practice of bloodletting in the fifth century BC.

Through long contact with Greek culture, and their eventual conquest of Greece, the Romans absorbed many Greek (and other) ideas on medicine. The humoral theory fell out of favor in some quarters. The Greek physician Asclepiades (–40 BC), who practiced in Rome, discarded it and advocated humane treatments, and had insane persons freed from confinement and treated them with natural therapy, such as diet and massages. Arateus (–90 AD) argued that it is hard to pinpoint from where a mental illness comes. However, Galen (129–), practicing in Greece and Rome, revived humoral theory. Galen, however, adopted a single symptom approach rather than broad diagnostic categories, for example studying separate states of sadness, excitement, confusion and memory loss.

Playwrights such as Homer, Sophocles and Euripides described madmen driven insane by the gods, imbalanced humors or circumstances. As well as the triad (of which mania was often used as an overarching term for insanity) there were a variable and overlapping range of terms for such things as delusion, eccentricity, frenzy, and lunacy. Roman encyclopedist Celsus argued that insanity is really present when a continuous dementia begins due to the mind being at the mercy of imaginings. He suggested that people must heal their own souls through philosophy and personal strength. He described common practices of dietetics, bloodletting, drugs, talking therapy, incubation in temples, exorcism, incantations and amulets, as well as restraints and &quot;tortures&quot; to restore rationality, including starvation, being terrified suddenly, agitation of the spirit, and stoning and beating. Most, however, did not receive medical treatment but stayed with family or wandered the streets, vulnerable to assault and derision. Accounts of delusions from the time included people who thought themselves to be famous actors or speakers, animals, inanimate objects, or one of the gods. Some were arrested for political reasons, such as Jesus ben Ananias who was eventually released as a madman after showing no concern for his own fate during torture.

===Israel and the Hebrew diaspora===
Passages of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament have been interpreted as describing mood disorders in figures such as Job, King Saul and in the Psalms of David. In the Book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar is described as temporarily losing his sanity. Mental disorder was not a problem like any other, caused by one of the gods, but rather caused by problems in the relationship between the individual and God. They believed that abnormal behavior was the result of possessions that represented the wrath and punishment from God. This punishment was seen as a withdrawal of God&#x27;s protection and the abandonment of the individual to evil forces.

From the beginning of the twentieth century, the mental health of Jesus is also discussed.

==Middle Ages==

===Middle East===
Persian and Arabic scholars were heavily involved in translating, analyzing and synthesizing Greek texts and concepts. As the Muslim world expanded, Greek concepts were integrated with religious thought and over time, new ideas and concepts were developed. Arab texts from this period contain discussions of melancholia, mania, hallucinations, delusions, and other mental disorders. Mental disorder was generally connected to loss of reason, and writings covered links between the brain and disorders, and spiritual/mystical meaning of disorders. wrote about fear and anxiety, anger and aggression, sadness and depression, and obsessions.

Authors who wrote on mental disorders and/or proposed treatments during this period include Al-Balkhi, Al-Razi, Al-Farabi, Ibn-Sina, Al-Majusi Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, Averroes, and Najab ud-din Unhammad.

Some thought mental disorder could be caused by possession by a djinn (devil), which could be either good or demon-like. There were sometimes beatings to exorcise the djin, or alternatively over-zealous attempts at cures. Islamic views often merged with local traditions. In Morocco the traditional Berber people were animists and the concept of sorcery was integral to the understanding of mental disorder; it was mixed with the Islamic concepts of djin and often treated by religious scholars combining the roles of holy man, sage, and sorcerer.

The first bimaristan was founded in Baghdad in the 9th century, and several others of increasing complexity were created throughout the Arab world in the following centuries. Some of them contained wards dedicated to the care of mentally ill patients, most of whom had debilitating illnesses or exhibited violence. In the centuries to come, the Muslim world would eventually serve as a critical of knowledge for Renaissance Europe, through the Latin translations of many scientific Islamic texts. Ibn-Sina&#x27;s (Avicenna&#x27;s) Canon of Medicine became the standard of medical science in Europe for centuries, together with works of Hippocrates and Galen.

===Europe===
Conceptions of madness in the Middle Ages in Europe were a mixture of the divine, diabolical, magical and transcendental. Theories of the four humors (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood) were applied, sometimes separately (a matter of &quot;physic&quot;) and sometimes combined with theories of evil spirits (a matter of &quot;faith&quot;). Arnaldus de Villanova (1235–1313) combined &quot;evil spirit&quot; and Galen-oriented &quot;four humours&quot; theories and promoted trephining as a cure to let demons and excess humours escape. Other bodily remedies in general use included purges, bloodletting and whipping. Madness was often seen as a moral issue, either a punishment for sin or a test of faith and character. Christian theology endorsed various therapies, including fasting and prayer for those estranged from God and exorcism of those possessed by the devil. Thus, although mental disorder was often thought to be due to sin, other more mundane causes were also explored, including intemperate diet and alcohol, overwork, and grief. The Franciscan friar Bartholomeus Anglicus ( – 1272) described a condition which resembles depression in his encyclopedia, &quot;De Proprietatibis Rerum&quot;, and he suggested that music would help. A semi-official tract called the Praerogativa regis distinguished between the &quot;natural born idiot&quot; and the &quot;lunatic&quot;. The latter term was applied to those with periods of mental disorder; deriving from either Roman mythology describing people &quot;moonstruck&quot; by the goddess Luna or theories of an influence of the moon.

Episodes of mass dancing mania are reported from the Middle Ages, &quot;which gave to the individuals affected all the appearance of insanity&quot;. This was one kind of mass delusion or mass hysteria/panic that has occurred around the world through the millennia.

The care of lunatics was primarily the responsibility of the family. In England, if the family were unable or unwilling, an assessment was made by crown representatives in consultation with a local jury and all interested parties, including the subject himself or herself. The process was confined to those with real estate or personal estate, but it encompassed poor as well as rich and took into account psychological and social issues. Those considered lunatics at the time probably had more support from their communities and families than those diagnosed with mental disorders today, since the focus now is primarily on providing professional medical support. As in other eras, visions were generally interpreted as meaningful spiritual and visionary insights; some may have been causally related to mental disorders, but since hallucinations were culturally supported they may not have had the same connections as today.

==Modern period==

=== Europe and the Americas ===

====16th to 18th centuries====
Some mentally ill people may have been victims of the witch-hunts that spread in waves in early modern Europe. However, those judged insane were increasingly admitted to local workhouses, poorhouses and jails (particularly the &quot;pauper insane&quot;) or sometimes to the new private madhouses. Restraints and forcible confinement were used for those thought dangerously disturbed or potentially violent to themselves, others or property. The latter likely grew out of lodging arrangements for single individuals (who, in workhouses, were considered disruptive or ungovernable) then there were a few catering each for only a handful of people, then they gradually expanded (e.g. 16 in London in 1774, and 40 by 1819). By the mid-19th century there would be 100 to 500 inmates in each. The development of this network of madhouses has been linked to new capitalist social relations and a service economy, that meant families were no longer able or willing to look after disturbed relatives.

Madness was commonly depicted in literary works, such as the plays of Shakespeare.

By the end of the 17th century and into the Enlightenment, madness was increasingly seen as an organic physical phenomenon, no longer involving the soul or moral responsibility. The mentally ill were typically viewed as insensitive wild animals. Harsh treatment and restraint in chains was seen as therapeutic, helping suppress the animal passions. There was sometimes a focus on the management of the environment of madhouses, from diet to exercise regimes to number of visitors. Severe somatic treatments were used, similar to those in medieval times. Madhouse owners sometimes boasted of their ability with the whip. Treatment in the few public asylums was also barbaric, often secondary to prisons. The most notorious was Bedlam where at one time spectators could pay a penny to watch the inmates as a form of entertainment.

Concepts based in humoral theory gradually gave way to metaphors and terminology from mechanics and other developing physical sciences. Complex new schemes were developed for the classification of mental disorders, influenced by emerging systems for the biological classification of organisms and medical classification of diseases.

The term &quot;crazy&quot; (from Middle English meaning cracked) and insane (from Latin insanus meaning unhealthy) came to mean mental disorder in this period. The term &quot;lunacy&quot;, long used to refer to periodic disturbance or epilepsy, came to be synonymous with insanity. &quot;Madness&quot;, long in use in root form since at least the early centuries AD, and originally meaning crippled, hurt or foolish, came to mean loss of reason or self-restraint. &quot;Psychosis&quot;, from Greek &quot;principle of life/animation&quot;, had varied usage referring to a condition of the mind/soul. &quot;Nervous&quot;, from an Indo-European root meaning to wind or twist, meant muscle or vigor, was adopted by physiologists to refer to the body&#x27;s electrochemical signaling process (thus called the nervous system), and was then used to refer to nervous disorders and neurosis. &quot;Obsession&quot;, from a Latin root meaning to sit on or sit against, originally meant to besiege or be possessed by an evil spirit, came to mean a fixed idea that could decompose the mind.

With the rise of madhouses and the professionalization and specialization of medicine, there was a considerable incentive for medical doctors to become involved. In the 18th century, they began to stake a claim to a monopoly over madhouses and treatments. Madhouses could be a lucrative business, and many made a fortune from them. There were some bourgeois ex-patient reformers who opposed the often brutal regimes, blaming both the madhouse owners and the medics, who in turn resisted the reforms.

Towards the end of the 18th century, a moral treatment movement developed, that implemented more humane, psychosocial, and personalized approaches. Notable figures included the medic Vincenzo Chiarugi in Italy under Enlightenment leadership; the ex-patient superintendent Pussin and the psychologically inclined medic Philippe Pinel in revolutionary France; the Quakers in England, led by businessman William Tuke; and later, in the United States, campaigner Dorothea Dix.

====19th century====
The 19th century, in the context of industrialization and population growth, saw a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every Western country, a process called &quot;the great confinement&quot; or the &quot;asylum era&quot;. Laws were introduced to compel authorities to deal with those judged insane by family members and hospital superintendents. Although originally based on the concepts and structures of moral treatment, they became large impersonal institutions overburdened with large numbers of people with a complex mix of mental and social-economic problems. The success of moral treatment had cast doubt on the approach of medics, and many had opposed it, but by the mid-19th century many became advocates of it but argued that the mad also often had physical/organic problems so that both approaches were necessary. This argument has been described as an important step in the profession&#x27;s eventual success in securing a monopoly on the treatment of lunacy. However, it is well documented that very little therapeutic activity occurred in the new asylum system, that medics were little more than administrators who seldom attended to patients, and then mainly for other physical problems. The &quot;oldest forensic secure hospital in Europe&quot; was opened in 1850 after Sir Thomas Freemantle introduced the bill that was to establish a Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum in Ireland on 19 May 1845.

Clear descriptions of some syndromes, such as the condition that would later be termed schizophrenia, have been identified as relatively rare prior to the 19th century, although interpretations of the evidence and its implications are inconsistent.

Numerous different classification schemes and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities, taking an increasingly anatomical-clinical descriptive approach. The term &quot;psychiatry&quot; was coined as the medical specialty became more academically established. Asylum superintendents, later to be psychiatrists, were generally called &quot;alienists&quot; because they were thought to deal with people alienated from society; they adopted largely isolated and managerial roles in the asylums while milder &quot;neurotic&quot; conditions were dealt with by neurologists and general physicians, although there was overlap for conditions such as neurasthenia.

In the United States it was proposed that black slaves who tried to escape had a mental disorder termed drapetomania. It was then argued in scientific journals that mental disorders were rare under conditions of slavery but became more common following emancipation, and later that mental illness in African Americans was due to evolutionary factors or various negative characteristics, and that they were not suitable for therapeutic intervention.

By the 1870s in North America, officials who ran Lunatic Asylums renamed them Insane Asylums. By the late century, the term &quot;asylum&quot; had lost its original meaning as a place of refuge, retreat or safety, and was associated with abuses that had been widely publicized in the media, including by ex-patient organization the Alleged Lunatics&#x27; Friend Society and ex-patients like Elizabeth Packard.

The relative proportion of the public officially diagnosed with mental disorders was increasing, however. This has been linked to various factors, including possibly humanitarian concern; incentives for professional status/money; a lowered tolerance of communities for unusual behavior due to the existence of asylums to place them in (this affected the poor the most); and the strain placed on families by industrialization.

====20th century====

The turn of the 20th century saw the development of psychoanalysis, which came to the fore later. Kraepelin&#x27;s classification gained popularity, including the separation of mood disorders from what would later be termed schizophrenia.

Asylum superintendents sought to improve the image and medical status of their profession. Asylum &quot;inmates&quot; were increasingly referred to as &quot;patients&quot; and asylums renamed as hospitals. Referring to people as having a &quot;mental illness&quot; dates from this period in the early 20th century.

In the United States, a &quot;mental hygiene&quot; movement, originally defined in the 19th century, gained momentum and aimed to &quot;prevent the disease of insanity&quot; through public health methods and clinics. The term mental health became more popular, however. Clinical psychology and social work developed as professions alongside psychiatry. Theories of eugenics led to compulsory sterilization movements in many countries around the world for several decades, often encompassing patients in public mental institutions. World War I saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed &quot;shell shock&quot;.

In Nazi Germany, the institutionalized mentally ill were among the earliest targets of sterilization campaigns and covert &quot;euthanasia&quot; programs. It has been estimated that over 200,000 individuals with mental disorders of all kinds were put to death, although their mass murder has received relatively little historical attention. Despite not being formally ordered to take part, psychiatrists and psychiatric institutions were at the center of justifying, planning and carrying out the atrocities at every stage, and &quot;constituted the connection&quot; to the later annihilation of Jews and other &quot;undesirables&quot; such as homosexuals in The Holocaust.

In other areas of the world, funding was often cut for asylums, especially during periods of economic decline, and during wartime in particular many patients starved to death. Soldiers received increased psychiatric attention, and World War II saw the development in the US of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders, which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) followed suit with a section on mental disorders.

Previously restricted to the treatment of severely disturbed people in asylums, psychiatrists cultivated clients with a broader range of problems, and between 1917 and 1970 the number practicing outside institutions swelled from 8 percent to 66 percent. The term stress, having emerged from endocrinology work in the 1930s, was popularized with an increasingly broad biopsychosocial meaning, and was increasingly linked to mental disorders. &quot;Outpatient commitment&quot; laws were gradually expanded or introduced in some countries.

Lobotomies, Insulin shock therapy, Electro convulsive therapy, and the &quot;neuroleptic&quot; chlorpromazine came into use mid-century.

An antipsychiatry movement came to the fore in the 1960s. Deinstitutionalization gradually occurred in the West, with isolated psychiatric hospitals being closed down in favor of community mental health services. However, inadequate services and continued social exclusion often led to many being homeless or in prison. A consumer/survivor movement gained momentum.

Other kinds of psychiatric medication gradually came into use, such as &quot;psychic energizers&quot; and lithium. Benzodiazepines gained widespread use in the 1970s for anxiety and depression, until dependency problems curtailed their popularity. Advances in neuroscience and genetics led to new research agendas. Cognitive behavioral therapy was developed. Through the 1990s, new SSRI antidepressants became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world.

The DSM and then ICD adopted new criteria-based classification, representing a return to a Kraepelin-like descriptive system. The number of &quot;official&quot; diagnoses saw a large expansion, although homosexuality was gradually downgraded and dropped in the face of human rights protests. Different regions sometimes developed alternatives such as the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders or Latin American Guide for Psychiatric Diagnosis.

In early 20th century, lobotomy was introduced until the mid-1950s.

In 1927 insulin coma therapy was introduced and used until 1960. Physicians deliberately put the patient into a low blood sugar coma because they thought that large fluctuations in insulin levels could alter the function of the brain. Risks included prolonged coma. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) was later adopted as a substitution to this treatment.

====21st century====
DSM-IV and previous versions of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; presented extremely high comorbidity, diagnostic heterogeneity of the categories, unclear boundaries, that have been interpreted as intrinsic anomalies of the criterial, neopositivistic approach leading the system to a state of scientific crisis. Accordingly, a radical rethinking of the concept of mental disorder and the need of a radical scientific revolution in psychiatric taxonomy was proposed.

In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the &quot;DSM–5&quot; after more than 10 years of research.

<doc id="354633" wikidata="Q1135834" url="?curid=354633" title="Westminster tube station">
<text>Westminster is a London Underground station in the City of Westminster, England. It is served by three lines: Circle, District and Jubilee. On the Circle and District lines the station is between St James&#x27;s Park and Embankment stations, and on the Jubilee line it is between Green Park and Waterloo stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. 

The station is located at the corner of Bridge Street and Victoria Embankment and is close to the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, and the London Eye. Also close by are Downing Street, the Cenotaph, Westminster Millennium Pier, the Treasury, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the Supreme Court.

The station is in two parts: sub-surface platforms opened in 1868 by the District Railway (DR) as part of the company&#x27;s first section of the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; route and deep level platforms opened in 1999 as part of the Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, but the original station was completely rebuilt in conjunction with the construction of the deep level platforms and Portcullis House, which sits above the station.

==History==

===Circle &amp; District line platforms===
The station was opened as &quot;Westminster Bridge&quot; on 24 December 1868 by the steam-operated District Railway (DR) (now the District line) when the railway opened the first section of its line from South Kensington. It was originally the eastern terminus of the DR and the station cutting ended at a concrete wall buffered by timber sleepers. The approach to the station from the west runs in cut and cover tunnel under the roadway of Broad Sanctuary and diagonally under Parliament Square. In Broad Sanctuary the tunnel is close to Westminster Abbey and St Margaret&#x27;s church and care was required to avoid undermining their foundations when excavating in the poor ground found there.

The original station building was a temporary structure positioned over the tracks and the platforms were sheltered with individual awnings rather than the all-over glazed roof provided at the DR&#x27;s other stations. Access to the station was via a passageway from Bridge Street and a pedestrian subway under the road. On 30 May 1870, the railway was extended to Blackfriars.

The DR connected to the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated its trains over the other&#x27;s tracks in a joint service known as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;. On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl&#x27;s Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London Line) at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service began running over the DR&#x27;s tracks. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from its terminus at Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London Line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House – at that time the eastern terminus of the DR.

From 1 August 1872, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service also began operations through South Kensington, running from Moorgate along the MR&#x27;s tracks on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, on the WLEJR to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H&amp;CR and the DR. On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was shortened to terminate at Earl&#x27;s Court, and, on 31 December 1908, the Outer Circle service was withdrawn from the DR tracks. As part of efforts to improve competitiveness, the DR&#x27;s tracks were electrified during 1905 and new electric rolling stock was brought into use. In 1907, the station was given its present name, &quot;Westminster&quot;.

By the mid-1890s the station entrance had been incorporated into a larger building. In 1922, a new entrance and canopy was designed for the Bridge Street entrance by Charles Holden and, in 1924, he designed a plainly rendered replacement elevation for the eastern entrance on to the Embankment. These were the first of many projects by the architect for the London Electric Railway (the main forerunner of London Transport and Transport for London). The station platforms were also refurbished with new wall tiling in the green, blue, black and white tiling scheme used later by Holden on many stations of the period and still visible at neighbouring St James&#x27;s Park station. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line.

Between late 1962 and early 1964 the east ends of the platforms were extended to allow longer 8-car trains to be operated. This involved carefully enlarging the tunnels under the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s original headquarters at New Scotland Yard (now Norman Shaw Buildings). The station was completely rebuilt to incorporate new deep-level platforms for the Jubilee line when it was extended to the London Docklands in the 1990s. During the works, the level of the sub-surface platforms was lowered to enable ground level access to Portcullis House. This was achieved in small increments which were carried out when the line was closed at night.

===Jubilee line platforms===

When the first section of the Jubilee line was planned in the 1970s, the second phase of the project was intended to continue the line eastwards from the terminus at Charing Cross to the City of London, Woolwich and Thamesmead. Westminster station would not have been on this planned route, but the need to provide transport infrastructure for the redevelopment of the London Docklands in east and south-east London led to a redirection of the route to run via Westminster to connect Waterloo and London Bridge stations with the new developments. For the Jubilee Line Extension, the buildings around the station were demolished and the sub-surface station was completely reconstructed together with the erection of a parliamentary office building, Portcullis House, which sits above the station. Both projects were designed by Michael Hopkins &amp; Partners.

The construction of the deep-level station involved the excavation of a deep void around and beneath the sub-surface station to house the escalators to the Jubilee line platforms. The void, known as the station box, was the deepest ever excavation in central London and was carried out between thick reinforced concrete diaphragm walls stiffened and braced horizontally for stability. Under Bridge Street, on the south side of the station box, the two Jubilee line platform tunnels are arranged with the westbound platform below the eastbound. The depth of the station box excavation and the proximity of the tunnels represented a significant risk to the stability of the foundation of the Houses of Parliament&#x27;s clock tower (commonly known as Big Ben), which stands only from the edge of the station box. To protect the foundation and manage settlement in the sub-soil, a series of long steel tubes were installed horizontally around and beneath the clock tower&#x27;s thick foundation. The tubes were provided with a control system through which grout was injected into the ground to compensate for settlement detected from detailed measurements of the clock tower&#x27;s position. As excavation of the station box and the tunnels took place, grout was injected on 22 occasions between January 1996 and September 1997. The process limited the movement of the clock tower to an acceptable maximum of . Without the grout injection, the movement would have been at least causing cracking to the structure of the tower and the Houses of Parliament. The Jubilee line platforms were opened on 22 December 1999, although trains had been running through the station without stopping since 20 November 1999.

The station&#x27;s architecture is an austere combination of concrete and stainless steel, with stacked banks of escalators supported from the cross-bracing structures spanning the station box and routes for passengers entering or leaving the station separated from those changing between lines. As with the other underground stations on the extension, the Jubilee line platforms feature platform edge doors to improve airflow through the system and increase safety. The station design won a number of awards including Civic Trust awards in 2000 and 2002, the Royal Fine Art Commission Millennium Building of the Year award in 2000 and the RIBA Award for Architecture in 2001. Both projects were jointly short-listed in 2001 for the RIBA&#x27;s prestigious Stirling Prize.

In July 2003, the Royal Navy unveiled a plaque of HMS Westminster in the station concourse, commemorating the relationship between London Underground and Navy.

As part of the Transported by Design programme of activities, on 15 October 2015, after two months of public voting, Westminster tube station was elected by Londoners as one of the 10 favourite transport design icons.

==Services==

<doc id="354643" wikidata="Q51367" url="?curid=354643" title="Plausible deniability">
<text>Plausible deniability is the ability of people, typically senior officials in a formal or informal chain of command, to deny knowledge and/or responsibility for actions committed by or on behalf of members of their organizational hierarchy. They may do so because of a lack of evidence that can confirm their participation, even if they were personally involved in or at least willfully ignorant of the actions. If illegal or otherwise disreputable and unpopular activities become public, high-ranking officials may deny any awareness of such acts to insulate themselves and shift the blame onto the agents who carried out the acts, as they are confident that their doubters will be unable to prove otherwise. The lack of evidence to the contrary ostensibly makes the denial plausible (credible), but sometimes, it makes any accusations only unactionable.

The term typically implies forethought, such as intentionally setting up the conditions for the plausible avoidance of responsibility for one&#x27;s future actions or knowledge. In some organizations, legal doctrines such as command responsibility exist to hold major parties responsible for the actions of subordinates who are involved in actions and nullify any legal protection that their denial of involvement would carry.

In politics and especially espionage, deniability refers to the ability of a powerful player or intelligence agency to pass the buck and to avoid blowback by secretly arranging for an action to be taken on its behalf by a third party that is ostensibly unconnected with the major player. In political campaigns, plausible deniability enables candidates to stay clean and denounce third-party advertisements that use unethical approaches or potentially libelous innuendo.

Although plausible deniability has existed throughout history, the term is believed to have been coined by the CIA in the 1950s and was popularized during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s.

==Overview==
Arguably, the key concept of plausible deniability is plausibility. It is relatively easy for a government official to issue a blanket denial of an action, and it is possible to destroy or cover up evidence after the fact, that might be sufficient to avoid a criminal prosecution, for instance. However, the public might well disbelieve the denial, particularly if there is strong circumstantial evidence or if the action is believed to be so unlikely that the only logical explanation is that the denial is false.

The concept is even more important in espionage. Intelligence may come from many sources, including human sources. The exposure of information to which only a few people are privileged may directly implicate some of the people in the disclosure. An example is if an official is traveling secretly, and only one aide knows the specific travel plans. If that official is assassinated during his travels, and the circumstances of the assassination strongly suggest that the assassin had foreknowledge of the official&#x27;s travel plans, the probable conclusion is that his aide has betrayed the official. There may be no direct evidence linking the aide to the assassin, but collaboration can be inferred from the facts alone, thus making the aide&#x27;s denial implausible.

==History==

The term&#x27;s roots go back to US President Harry Truman&#x27;s National Security Council Paper 10/2 of June 18, 1948, which defined &quot;covert operations&quot; as &quot;all activities (except as noted herein) which are conducted or sponsored by this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.&quot; During the Eisenhower administration, NSC 10/2 was incorporated into the more-specific NSC 5412/2 &quot;Covert Operations.&quot; NSC 5412 was declassified in 1977 and is located at the National Archives. The expression &quot;plausibly deniable&quot; was first used publicly by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Allen Dulles. The idea, on the other hand, is considerably older. For example, in the 19th century, Charles Babbage described the importance of having &quot;a few simply honest men&quot; on a committee who could be temporarily removed from the deliberations when &quot;a peculiarly delicate question arises&quot; so that one of them could &quot;declare truly, if necessary, that he never was present at any meeting at which even a questionable course had been proposed.&quot;

===Church Committee===
A U.S. Senate committee, the Church Committee, in 1974–1975 conducted an investigation of the intelligence agencies. In the course of the investigation, it was revealed that the CIA, going back to the Kennedy administration, had plotted the assassination of a number of foreign leaders, including Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro, but the president himself, who clearly supported such actions, was not to be directly involved so that he could deny knowledge of it. That was given the term &quot;plausible denial.&quot;

Plausible denial involves the creation of power structures and chains of command loose and informal enough to be denied if necessary. The idea was that the CIA and later other bodies could be given controversial instructions by powerful figures, including the president himself, but that the existence and true source of those instructions could be denied if necessary if, for example, an operation went disastrously wrong and it was necessary for the administration to disclaim responsibility.

===Later legislative barriers===
The Hughes–Ryan Act of 1974 sought to put an end to plausible denial by requiring a presidential finding for each operation to be important to national security, and the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 required for Congress to be notified of all covert operations. Both laws, however, are full of enough vague terms and escape hatches to allow the executive branch to thwart their authors&#x27; intentions, as was shown by the Iran–Contra affair. Indeed, the members of Congress are in a dilemma since when they are informed, they are in no position to stop the action, unless they leak its existence and thereby foreclose the option of covertness.

===Media reports===


===Iran–Contra affair===
In his testimony to the congressional committee studying the Iran–Contra affair, Vice Admiral John Poindexter stated: &quot;I made a deliberate decision not to ask the President, so that I could insulate him from the decision and provide some future deniability for the President if it ever leaked out.&quot;

===Declassified government documents===
* A telegram from the Ambassador in Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., to Special Assistant for National Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy on US options with respect to a possible coup, mentions plausible denial.
* CIA and White House documents on covert political intervention in the 1964 Chilean election have been declassified. The CIA&#x27;s Chief of Western Hemisphere Division, J.C. King, recommended for funds for the campaign to &quot;be provided in a fashion causing (Eduardo Frei Montalva president of Chile) to infer United States origin of funds and yet permitting plausible denial.&quot;
* Training files of the CIA&#x27;s covert &quot;Operation PBSuccess&quot; for the 1954 coup in Guatemala describe plausible deniability. According to the National Security Archive: &quot;Among the documents found in the training files of Operation PBSuccess and declassified by the Agency is a CIA document titled &#x27;A Study of Assassination.&#x27; A how-to guide book in the art of political killing, the 19-page manual offers detailed descriptions of the procedures, instruments, and implementation of assassination.&quot; The manual states that to provide plausible denial, &quot;no assassination instructions should ever be written or recorded.&quot;

=== Soviet operations ===
In the 1980s, the Soviet KGB ran OPERATION INFEKTION (also called &quot;OPERATION DENVER&quot;), which utilised the East German Stasi and Soviet-affiliated press to spread the idea that HIV/AIDS was an engineered bioweapon. The Stasi acquired plausible deniability on the operation by covertly supporting biologist Jakob Segal, whose stories were picked up by international press, including &quot;numerous bourgeois newspapers&quot; such as the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. Publications in third-party countries were then cited as the originators of the claims. Meanwhile, Soviet intelligence obtained plausible deniability by utilising the German Stasi in the disinformation operation.

===Little green men and Wagner Group===
In 2014, &quot;Little green men&quot;—troops without insignia carrying modern Russian military equipment—emerged at the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; described as a tactic of plausible deniability.

The Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, has been described as an attempt at plausible deniability for Kremlin-backed interventions in Ukraine, Syria, and in various interventions in Africa.

==Flaws==
* It is an open door to the abuse of authority by requiring that the parties in question to be said to be able to have acted independently, which, in the end, is tantamount to giving them license to act independently.
* The denials are sometimes seen as plausible but sometimes seen through by both the media and the populace.
* Plausible deniability increases the risk of misunderstanding between senior officials and their employees.

==Other examples==
Another example of plausible deniability is someone who actively avoids gaining certain knowledge of facts because it benefits that person not to know.

As an example, a lawyer may suspect that facts exist that would hurt his case but decide not to investigate the issue because if he has actual knowledge, the rules of ethics might require him to reveal the facts to the opposing side.

===Council on Foreign Relations===
===Use in computer networks===
In computer networks, plausible deniability often refers to a situation in which people can deny transmitting a file, even when it is proven to come from their computer.

That is sometimes done by setting the computer to relay certain types of broadcasts automatically in such a way that the original transmitter of a file is indistinguishable from those who are merely relaying it. In that way, those who first transmitted the file can claim that their computer had merely relayed it from elsewhere. This principle is used in the opentracker bittorrent implementation by including random IP addresses in peer lists.

In encrypted messaging protocols, such as bitmessage, every user on the network keeps a copy of every message, but is only able to decrypt their own and that can only be done by trying to decrypt every single message. Using this approach it is impossible to determine who sent a message to whom without being able to decrypt it. As everyone receives everything and the outcome of the decryption process is kept private.

It can also be done by a VPN if the host is not known.

In any case, that claim cannot be disproven without a complete decrypted log of all network connections.

====Freenet file sharing====
The Freenet file sharing network is another application of the idea by obfuscating data sources and flows to protect operators and users of the network by preventing them and, by extension, observers such as censors from knowing where data comes from and where it is stored.

===Use in cryptography===
In cryptography, deniable encryption may be used to describe steganographic techniques in which the very existence of an encrypted file or message is deniable in the sense that an adversary cannot prove that an encrypted message exists. In that case, the system is said to be &quot;fully undetectable&quot;.

Some systems take this further, such as MaruTukku, FreeOTFE and (to a much lesser extent) TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt, which nest encrypted data. The owner of the encrypted data may reveal one or more keys to decrypt certain information from it, and then deny that more keys exist, a statement which cannot be disproven without knowledge of all encryption keys involved. The existence of &quot;hidden&quot; data within the overtly encrypted data is then &quot;deniable&quot; in the sense that it cannot be proven to exist.

&quot;“Trepidation of Relationship”&quot; and &quot;“Trepidation of Memory”&quot; are two further cryptogaphical concepts to discuss plausible deniability, as also compared in a Youtube-Audio-Podcast.

*&quot;Trepidation of Memory“ refers to the temporal decoupling of key pairs. In the book “Super Secreto” by Theo Tenzer, the developer Textbrowser&#x27;s idea for the Spot-On Encryption Suite application describes how the assignment of public and private keys can become blurred over time. The use of ephemeral keys, which only exist temporarily, makes the traceability of communication more difficult. The collision of two asteroids is used a[s a figurative analogy: After the collision, the two original objects are no longer identifiable as they have disintegrated into individual parts and are moving away from each other. The new paradigm is to separate public and private keys again after they have been used, in the case of asymmetric encryption, or to remove the temporary, ephemeral key from the content in the case of symmetric encryption.

*&quot;Trepidation of Relationship” builds on this concept and refers to the relationships between users in a network. The use of human proxies, i.e. friends in the messenger&#x27;s friends list who forward messages on behalf of others, makes it more difficult to *identify the actual sender*. This innovative concept has been implemented in the messenger Spot-On Encryption Suite by the developer Textbrowser and then described in the book Human Proxies by Uni Nurf. Human Proxies offer new directions to end-to-end encryption: End-A-to-End-Z encryption must be rethought when it turns out to be an End-B-to-End-Z encryption. Since the key exchange with the proxy may have taken place in the past, the relationship may not be recognizable to external analysts if a user uses an old friend who has not been contacted or chatted with for a long time as a human proxy. The construct of the *Inner Envelope* behind the Human Proxy function also creates new cryptographic challenges, provides plausible deniability to included nodes, and offers new perspectives in encryption, its analysis and decryption: As all messages in the network are encrypted, end-to-end encryption is new defined and gets with Human Proxies a potential second and plausible deniable start point. 

These cryptographic concepts serve to protect privacy and increase security in networks. They make mass surveillance more difficult and enable plausible deniability. Both concepts can be summarized as follows:
*&quot;Trepidation of Memory:&quot; Makes it difficult to trace key pairs back in time.
*&quot;Trepidation of Relationship:&quot; Makes it difficult to identify communication relationships in a network.

===Programming===
The Underhanded C Contest is an annual programming contest involving the creation of carefully crafted defects, which have to be both very hard to find and plausibly deniable as mistakes once found.

<doc id="354644" wikidata="Q7715974" url="?curid=354644" title="The Beaches, Toronto">
<text>The Beaches (also known as &quot;the Beach&quot;) is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is so named because of its four beaches situated on Lake Ontario. It is located east of downtown within the &quot;Old&quot; City of Toronto. The approximate boundaries of the neighbourhood are from Victoria Park Avenue on the east to Kingston Road on the north, along Dundas Street to Coxwell Avenue on the west, south to Lake Ontario. The Beaches is part of the east-central district of Toronto.

==Character==
The commercial district of Queen Street East lies at the heart of the Beaches community. It is characterized by a large number of independent speciality stores. The stores along Queen are known to change tenants quite often causing the streetscape to change from year to year, sometimes drastically. 

The side streets are mostly lined with semi-detached and large-scale Victorian, Edwardian, and new-style houses. There are also low-rise apartment buildings and a few row-houses. Controversy has risen in recent years over new development in the neighbourhood that is changing the traditional aesthetic, with denser housing causing some residents to protect the traditional cottage-like appearance of the homes with heritage designations for some streets.

There is an extensive park system along the Waterfront (with Kew Gardens being the only one that extends up to Queen Street) as well as a parks that follow a ravine (partially buried) that bisects the neighbourhood from North to South at Glen Manor Road. Kingston Road is a four-lane road along the northern section of the neighbourhood. Woodbine Avenue is a five-lane road originating from Lake Shore Boulevard at the Lake Ontario shoreline, running north. It is primarily residential.

The beach itself is a single uninterrupted stretch of sandy shoreline bounded by the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant (locally known as the water works) to the east and Woodbine Beach Park (a small peninsula in Lake Ontario) to the west. A long boardwalk runs along most of its length with a portion of the Martin Goodman Trail bike path running parallel. Although it is continuous, there are four names which correspond each to approximately one quarter of the length of the beach (from east to west): Balmy Beach, Scarboro Beach, Kew Beach and Woodbine Beach. Woodbine Beach and Kew-Balmy Beach are Blue Flag certified for cleanliness and are suitable for swimming. The park and beach areas of the neighbourhood are known to be animal friendly and offer both on and off-leash dog parks. The neighbourhood also serves as a home to Toronto wildlife. Most recently, Woodbine Beach has become a home to a family of red foxes that have made their den underneath the boardwalk.

In the 2006 Canadian census the Beach was covered by census tracts 0020.00, 0021.00, 0022.00, 0023.00, and 0024.00. According to that census, the neighbourhood has 20,416 residents, a 7.8% increase from the 2001 census. Average income is $67,536, well above the average for Toronto.

===Location===

The neighbourhood is located to the East of Toronto&#x27;s downtown, from Coxwell east to Victoria Park. The lakefront is divided into four sections; Woodbine Beach to the west, Kew Beach and Scarboro Beach in the centre, and Balmy Beach to the east. It is four beaches which give the neighbourhood its name and defining principal characteristic. Until Lake Shore Boulevard was extended to Woodbine Avenue in the 1950s, Woodbine Beach was not a bathing beach, but rather a desolate wooded area known as &quot;The Cut&quot;. And Woodbine Avenue was the western boundary of the neighbourhood. While the official City northern boundary ends at Kingston Road, the area to the north has become known as the &#x27;Upper Beaches&#x27; according to real estate marketers. The area bounded by Queen Street, Woodbine and Kingston Road is nicknamed the &#x27;Beach Triangle&#x27;.

====Ashbridge&#x27;s Bay====

Ashbridge&#x27;s Bay is a small body of water that was once part of the marsh that lay east of Toronto Islands and Toronto Harbour. The bay is named for the Ashbridge family that once lived nearby on a farm. Infill to form the Port Lands and building of the water treatment plant shrunk the size of the bay to the area between the Port Lands and Woodbine Beach. The current bay is surrounded by marinas, the treatment plant and a small tree lined section along Lake Shore Boulevard East such that the original natural shoreline has disappeared completely.

===Name===
The name of the community is the subject of a long-standing dispute. Some long-time local residents assert that &quot;the Beach&quot; is the proper historical name for the area, whereas others are of the view that &quot;the Beaches&quot; also has at least equal historical provenance and is additionally the more universally recognized neighbourhood name, particularly by non-residents. All government levels refer to the riding, or the ward in the case of the municipal government, as Beaches-East York. As well, for research and information management purposes, the City of Toronto government officially categorizes the neighbourhood as &quot;the Beaches&quot;.

The dispute over the area&#x27;s name reached a fever pitch in 1985, when the City of Toronto installed 14 street signs designating the neighbourhood as &quot;the Beaches&quot;. The resulting controversy resulted in the eventual removal of the signs, although the municipal government continues to officially designate the area as &quot;the Beaches&quot;. In early 2006 the local Beaches Business Improvement Area voted to place &quot;the Beach&quot; on signs slated to appear on new lampposts over the summer, but local outcry caused them to rescind that decision. The Beaches Business Improvement Area board subsequently held a poll (online, in person and by ballot) in April 2006 to determine whether the new street signs would be designated &quot;the Beach&quot; or &quot;the Beaches&quot;, and 58% of participants selected &quot;the Beach&quot; as the name to appear on the signs.

In fact, the two names have been used to refer to the area since the first homes were built in the 19th century. In his book, &quot;Accidental City: The Transformation of Toronto&quot;, Robert Fulford, himself a former resident, wrote: &quot;the historical argument for &#x27;the Beaches&#x27; as a name turns out to be at least as strong as the historical argument for &#x27;the Beach&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Pluralists&quot; hold that since the area had four distinct beach areas, using the singular term is illogical. Those preferring the singular term &quot;Beach&quot; hold that the term has historically referred to the area as the four distinct beach areas merged.

Historically, there are or were a number of institutions that used the term &quot;Beach&quot; in the singular, including the original Beach telephone exchange (1903 - 1920s), the Beach Hebrew Institute (1920), the Beach Theatre (1919 to the 1960s), and the Beach Streetcar (1923–1948). The singular form has also been adopted by the local historical society, which is called the Beach and East York Historical Society (from 1974). There are also numerous examples of early local institutions that use the plural form &quot;Beaches&quot;, such as the Beaches Library (1915), the Beaches Presbyterian Church (1926), the Beaches Branch of the Canadian Legion and a local war monument in Kew Beach erected post WWII by the &quot;Beaches Business Men&#x27;s Association&quot;.

In May 2009, the City of Toronto started the installation of &quot;the Beach&quot; signs along Queen Street.

Despite the naming controversy, most Torontonians recognize either name as referring to this particular neighbourhood, even though there are several other beaches located elsewhere in the city.

==History==

Originally a heavily wooded area dotted with private homes and swampland, the current shoreline and the Kew Gardens private park grounds were appropriated by the Toronto Harbour Commission in the early 1900s. The current beach was artificially enlarged and made continuous in 1930 with the use of wooden groynes. The public boardwalk and facilities were officially opened to the public in 1932.

The beach is diminishing as the sand is continuously pushed by lake currents from east to west. Historically, the sand was, and to a lesser degree still is, replaced by new sand generated by the erosion of the Scarborough Bluffs to the east. This source of sand has been diminished by municipal efforts to reduce erosion of the bluffs, and groynes constructed of rocks have been used to stabilise the shoreline.

==Attractions and landmarks==

In the early 1900s, the neighbourhood was the site of several amusement parks - Victoria Park (1878-1906), Munro Park (1896-1906), and Scarboro Beach Park (1907-1925). Today, their namesakes remain as streets. Beginning in 1890s there was a ferry service (Victoria Park Ferry) to the area (in addition to streetcar service on Queen Street) from Yonge Street and ended after the closure of the parks.

Kew Gardens is a medium-sized park in the neighbourhood running from Queen Street to Lake Ontario, and includes the Alex Christie Bandstand for concerts. Every July, the neighbourhood celebrates the Beaches International Jazz Festival, drawing thousands to the area. However, now most of the performances occur at Woodbine Beach Park.

Another notable site in the area is the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant, which has been featured in several television programs, as well as in the films &quot;Half Baked&quot;, &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot;, &quot;Four Brothers&quot; and &quot;Undercover Brother&quot;, and in Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s novel &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot;.

<text>John H. Reading (November 26, 1917 – February 7, 2003) was an American businessman and politician based in Oakland, California. He was elected as the 44th Mayor of Oakland, California and served three four-year terms, from 1966 to 1977. Since his terms, voters have consistently elected Democratic candidates as mayor of the city.

==Life and career==
Born in Glendale, Arizona, Reading moved as a youth with his family to Oakland. There he attended public schools. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1940, after having worked his way through college.

During World War II, Reading served in the Army Air Force as both a pilot and flight training officer. He attained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

After the war, Reading inherited his father&#x27;s business, Ingram&#x27;s Food Products. The company was based in East Oakland, and was famous for frozen Red&#x27;s Tamales. He was appointed to the Oakland City Council in 1961 and served on the body until being appointed as mayor.

In 1968 Charlie Finley moved the Athletics baseball team from Kansas City to Oakland during Mayor Reading&#x27;s tenure. The Oakland Athletics won three World Series while Reading was mayor. He was instrumental in gaining funding and supporting construction of the new Oakland Coliseum and expansion of the Oakland International Airport.

Reading was a Republican in a city that was becoming increasingly Democratic as the population became minority-majority. He is the last Republican to have been elected as mayor there.

Reading was elected three times: in 1967 to the position of mayor by appointment on an unexpired term, in 1969 for his first full four-year term. In 1973, Reading was forced into a run-off election by Democrat Bobby Seale, co-founder of the Black Panther Party. Reading won re-election easily.

Reading returned to his business after serving as mayor. He lived with his family in the Oak Knoll District of Oakland. Reading died in 2003 in Indian Wells, California.

<doc id="354666" wikidata="Q36420" url="?curid=354666" title="Shanghai Pudong International Airport">
<text>Shanghai Pudong International Airport is one of the two international airports serving Shanghai, China.

Pudong Airport serves both international flights and a smaller number of domestic flights, while the city&#x27;s other major airport, Shanghai–Hongqiao, mainly serves domestic and regional flights in East Asia. Located about east of the city center, Pudong Airport occupies a site adjacent to the coastline in eastern Pudong. The airport is operated by Shanghai Airport Authority.

The airport is the main hub for China Eastern Airlines and Shanghai Airlines, and a major international hub for Air China, as well as a secondary hub for China Southern Airlines. It is also the hub for privately owned Juneyao Air and Spring Airlines, and an Asia-Pacific cargo hub for FedEx, UPS and DHL. The DHL hub, opened in July 2012, is reportedly the largest express hub in Asia.

Pudong Airport had two main passenger terminals, flanked on both sides by four operational parallel runways. A third passenger terminal was started in 2021, in addition to a satellite terminal and two additional runways, which will raise its annual capacity from 60 million passengers to 80 million, along with the ability to handle six million tons of freight.

Pudong Airport is a fast-growing hub for both passenger and cargo traffic. With 3,440,084 metric tons handled in 2024, the airport is the world&#x27;s third-busiest airport by cargo traffic. Pudong Airport also served a total of 54,476,397 passengers in 2023, making it the second-busiest airport in China after Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, sixth-busiest in Asia, and the twenty-first-busiest in the world. It is also the busiest international gateway of mainland China, with 35.25 million international passengers.

Shanghai Pudong is the busiest international hub in China, and about half of its total passenger traffic is international. Pudong Airport is connected to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport by Shanghai Metro Line 2 and the Shanghai Maglev Train via Pudong International Airport Station. There are also airport buses connecting it with the rest of the city.

== History ==
=== Early development ===
Prior to the establishment of Pudong International Airport, Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport was the only primary airport of Shanghai. During the 1990s, the expansion of Hongqiao Airport to meet growing demand became impossible as the surrounding urban area was developing significantly, and an alternative to assume all international flights had to be sought.

After deliberation, the municipal government decided to adopt the suggestion from Professor Chen Jiyu of East China Normal University, who wrote a letter to the Mayor of Shanghai Xu Kuangdi suggesting that the new airport should be constructed on the tidal flats of the south bank of the Yangtze River estuary, on the coast of the Pudong development zone to the east of Shanghai.

Construction of the first phase of the new Shanghai Pudong International Airport began in October 1997, took two years to build at a cost of RMB 12 billion (US$1.67 billion), and was completed on 16 September 1999. It covers an area of and is from downtown Shanghai. The first phase of the airport has one 4E category runway () along with two parallel taxiways, an apron, seventy-six aircraft positions and a cargo warehouse. 

Shanghai Pudong International Airport was officially opened on 1 October 1999.

A second runway was opened on 17 March 2005, and construction of phase two (including a second terminal, a third runway and a cargo terminal) began in December 2005 and started operation on 26 March 2008, in time for the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics.

In November 2011, Pudong Airport received approval from the national government for a new round of expansion which includes two runways. The fourth runway, along with an auxiliary taxiway and traffic control facilities, is projected to cost 2.58 billion yuan (US$403 million). The fifth runway, along with a new traffic tower, will cost 4.65 billion yuan (US$726.6 million). Construction was completed in 2015 and has doubled the capacity of the airport.

=== Ongoing expansion ===
Pudong International Airport officially started the third phase of the Pudong International Airport expansion with the construction on a new south satellite terminal on 29 December 2015. The new satellite terminal will be the world&#x27;s largest single satellite terminal with a total construction area of , which is larger than the Pudong International Airport T2 terminal building (). The satellite terminal is composed of two halls, S1 and S2, forming an H-shaped structure. It will have an annual design capacity of 38 million passengers, The total cost of the project is estimated to be about 20.6 billion yuan. Halls S1 and S2 will have 83 gates. A high capacity people mover connecting T1 to S1 and T2 to S2 will be constructed. After the completion of the satellite terminal in 2019, Pudong International Airport will have an annual passenger capacity of 80 million passengers, ranking among the top ten airports in the world by capacity.

As of October 2019, the satellite terminal is in operation and connected by people movers to the main Terminals 1 and 2.

By 6 January 2021, work on Pudong Airport T3 began on the south side of the airfield. The new terminal is anticipated to serve 50 million annual passengers when it opens according to city officials, while the entire airport is expected to have 130 million passengers by 2030. Several public transport lines will be extended to T3.

== Facilities ==
The airport has 162 boarding bridges (T1-31 T2-41 Satellite terminal-90) along with 189 remote gates. Four runways are parallel to the terminals (four operational): one runway with 4E rating (capable of accommodating aircraft up to Boeing 747-400), two runways with 4F rating (capable of accommodating aircraft up to Airbus A380, Boeing 747-8, and Antonov An-225), and two runways with 4F rating .

Pudong airport currently has four runways. Rwy 35L/17R and Rwy 34R/16L are mostly used for landing while Rwy 35R/17L and Rwy 34L/16R are mostly used for takeoff. Runway 15/33 is not in operation.

=== Terminal 1 ===

Terminal 1 was opened to public and officially opened on 1 October 1999 along with a 4000-metre runway and a cargo hub. It was built to handle the demand for traffic and to relieve Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport&#x27;s traffic. The exterior of Terminal 1 is shaped like a seagull, and has 28 gates, 13 of which are double-decker gates. The capacity of Terminal 1 is 20 million passengers. It currently has 204 check-in counters, thirteen luggage conveying belts and covers an area of 280,000 square metres.

The gates for Terminal 1 is 1–12, 14–32 (linked with jetway), while the remote gates are 200–203, 251–258 (Domestic), 208–212, 213–216 (International).

=== Terminal 2 ===

Terminal 2 was officially opened to the public on 26 March 2008 along with the third runway, making the entire airport capable of handling 60 million passengers and 4.2 million tons of cargo annually. Terminal 2 is shaped like Terminal 1, although it more closely resembles a wave, and is slightly larger than Terminal 1. Terminal 2 also has more floor areas than Terminal 1. Terminal 2 is primarily used by Air China and other Star Alliance members.

The gates for Terminal 2 are 50–98 (Note that gates 58–90 are used as both the C gates (used for domestic flights) and the D gates (used for international flights). The gates between gates 65–79 are only odd numbered (65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79). Gates 50–57 and gates 92–98 are used for domestic flights only. The remote gates for Terminal 2 are C219-C224 for domestic and D228-D232 for international.

=== Satellite concourses ===
Construction on an additional satellite concourse facility that could accommodate further gates and terminal space started on 29 December 2015 and officially opened in September 2019. It is the largest stand-alone satellite airport terminal buildings in the world at 622,000 square meters. This project will support 38 million passengers annually through 90 departure gates across two S1 and S2 concourses. Gates for domestic flights are labelled H, while the gates for international flights and flights to Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan are labelled G in both satellite concourses.

=== Automatic people mover ===
Both S1 and S2 are connected together and are since the opening in September 2019 connected by an underground Shanghai Pudong Airport APM to the current T1 and T2 terminals operated by Shanghai Keolis for 20 years, including the East Line and the West Line. The operating section of the East Line is long, connecting Terminal 2 and Satellite 2, and the operating section of the West Line is long, connecting Terminal 1 and Satellite 1.

=== A380/B747-8 stands ===
Gates that can accommodate the A380/B747-8 are 24 (T1) 71,75 (T2) 119,121 (S1) 504-507 (remote stands near S1, on taxiway L02, between taxiway P3 and south of P2) 168, 170, 173 (S2).

=== A-CDM implementation ===
The airport has been using the Airport Collaborative Decision Making system (A-CDM) developed by the aviation data service company VariFlight since January 2017. The system is aimed to improve on-time performance and safety of the airport&#x27;s operations. By June 2017, Shanghai Pudong airport recorded 62.7% punctuality rate, which was a 15% increase compared to the same period previous year.

== Airlines and destinations ==

=== Passenger ===
Pudong Airport mainly serves international flights along with flights to Baotou, Changchun, Dalian, Zhangjiajie and some smaller cities while most domestic flights are operating at Hongqiao Airport. However, some domestic flights operating at Hongqiao Airport only may move to Pudong Airport operating only at Pudong Airport instead of both.
