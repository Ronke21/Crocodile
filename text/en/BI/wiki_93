<text>Lisburn (; ) is a city in Northern Ireland. It is southwest of Belfast city centre, on the River Lagan, which forms the boundary between County Antrim and County Down. First laid out in the 17th century by English and Welsh settlers, with the arrival of French Huguenots in the 18th century, the town developed as a global centre of the linen industry.

In 2002, as part of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Golden Jubilee celebrations, the predominantly unionist borough was granted city status alongside the largely nationalist town of Newry. With a population of 45,370 in the 2011 Census. Lisburn was the third-largest city in Northern Ireland. In the 2016 reform of local government in Northern Ireland Lisburn was joined with the greater part of Castlereagh to form the Lisburn City and Castlereagh District.

== Name ==
The town was originally known as &quot;Lisnagarvy&quot; (also spelt &quot;Lisnagarvey&quot; or &quot;Lisnagarvagh&quot;) after the townland in which it formed. This is derived .

In the records, the name &quot;Lisburn&quot; appears to supersede Lisnagarvey around 1662. One theory is that it comes from the Irish &quot;lios&quot; (&#x27;ringfort&#x27;) and the Scots &quot;burn&quot; (&#x27;stream&#x27;). Some speculate that &quot;-burn&quot; refers to the burning of the town during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, but there is evidence of earlier use. An English soldier later recalled the rebels having entered the town of Lisnagarvy at &quot;a place called Louzy Barne&quot;. In the town&#x27;s early days, there were possibly two ringforts: Lisnagarvy to the north and Lisburn to the south, and the latter may simply have been easier for the English settlers to pronounce.

== History ==
===Early town===
Lisburn&#x27;s original site was a fort located north of modern-day Wallace Park. In 1609 James I granted Sir Fulke Conway, a Welshman of Norman descent, the lands of Killultagh in southwest County Antrim.

In 1611 George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes remarked: &quot;In our travel from Dromore towards Knockfargus, we saw in Kellultagh upon Sir Fulke Conway’s lands a house of cagework in hand and almost finished, where he intends to erect a bawn of brick in a place called Lisnagarvagh. He has built a fair timber bridge over the river of Lagan near the house.&quot; In 1622 the first impressions of Sir Fulke&#x27;s brother and heir, Edward Conway, was of &quot;a curious place ... Greater storms are not in any place nor greater serenities: foul ways, boggy ground, pleasant fields, water brooks, rivers full of fish, full of game, the people in their attire, language, fashion: barbarous. In their entertainment free and noble.&quot;

Management of the Conways&#x27; Irish estate fell largely to George Rawdon, a Yorkshire man, who laid out the streets of Lisburn as they are today: Market Square, Bridge Street, Castle Street and Bow Street. He had a manor house built on what is now Castle Gardens, and in 1623, a church on the site of the current cathedral. In 1628, King Charles I granted a charter for a weekly market, which is still held in the town every Tuesday. To populate the town, Rawdon, hostile to the Presbyterian Scots already moving into the area, brought over English and Welsh settlers.

In 1641 the Irish, rising in the first instance against English, and not Scottish, settlers, were driven back three times from the town. A herd four hundred head of cattle driven against the gates failed to batter them down. The town nonetheless burned. In 1649 the town was secured by forces loyal to Cromwell&#x27;s English Commonwealth, routing an army of Scots Covenanters, and their Royalist allies, in the Battle of Lisnagarvey.

The Presbyterians, despite their loyalty to the Crown, upon its Restoration continued to be penalised as &quot;dissenters&quot; from the established Anglican church, the Church of Ireland. It was not until 1670 that they were permitted a meeting house in town, and that had to be of &quot;perishable materials [...] dark, narrow and devoid of any pretensions to art and comfort. Their support for King William (whose forces wintered in the town) and the &quot;Protestant cause&quot; in 1690 likewise failed to win them equal standing. Like the Roman Catholics, who had to wait another 60 years for a &quot;Mass House&quot;, Presbyterians were discouraged from exerting their presence. The First Presbyterian Church built in 1768 was screened (until 1970) from Market Square by shops.

The town was destroyed once again in 1707: the accidental conflagration giving rise to the town&#x27;s motto &quot;Ex igne resurgam&quot; --&quot;Out of the fire I shall arise&quot;. Conway&#x27;s Manor House was not restored (part of the surrounding wall and its gateway with the date 1677 engraved still stands on the south and east side of Castle Gardens). The Anglican church, designated by Charles II as Christ Church Cathedral in 1662, was rebuilt retaining the tower and the surviving galleries in the nave. The distinctive octagonal spire was added in 1804.

One of the few buildings spared in the fire of 1707 was the Friend&#x27;s Meeting House. Quakerism had been brought to the town in 1655 by a veteran of Cromwell&#x27;s army, William Edmundson. In 1766, a prosperous linen merchant, John Hancock, endowed what is now the grammar school known as Friends&#x27; School Lisburn.

John Wesley first visited Lisburn in 1756, and thereafter he returned to preach biannually until 1789. The first Wesleyan Methodist Preaching House was established in the town in 1772.

===The Huguenot and the linen trade===

Lisburn prides itself as the birthplace of Ireland&#x27;s linen industry. While production had been introduced by the Scots, the arrival in 1698 of Huguenot refugees from France brought more sophisticated techniques, and government support. Even as it raised duties on Ireland&#x27;s successful woollen trade (with the concurrence of the subordinate Irish Parliament), the English Parliament removed them on all Irish articles of hemp and flax, and the government gave Louis Crommelin, &quot;overseer of the royal linen manufacture of Ireland&quot;, money to promote their production.

The Huguenot retained their own place of worship, the &quot;French Church&quot; in Castle Street, until 1820. The last of its pastors, Saumarez Dubourdieu, was 56 years Master of the Classical School of the Bow Street. His students subscribed to his memorial and bust on the south interior of the cathedral.

Large scale manufacture began in 1764 when William Coulson established his first linen looms close by is now the Union Bridge. His mill supplied damask to the royal courts of Europe and, in the early nineteenth century, was to draw celebrity visitors, among them Grand Duke Michael of Russia, Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden, Louis Napoléon Lannes duc de Montebello, the Duke of Wellington and Lord John Russell.

To carry the town&#x27;s new trade, construction of the Belfast-Lisburn section of the Lagan Canal began in 1756. Despite problems of low water levels during the summer, the canal (extended in 1794 to Lough Neagh) continued to carry bulk cargoes until 1958.

In 1784, the Scotsman John Barbour began spinning linen thread, and in 1831 his son William moved production to what had originally been Crommelin&#x27;s bleach green at Hilden. By the end of the century Barbour&#x27;s Linen Thread Company was the largest mill of its kind in the world employing about 2000 people to work 30,000 spindles and 8,000 twisting machines. The company had built a model village for the workers, with 350 houses, two schools, a community hall, children&#x27;s playground and a village sports ground.

===Irish Volunteers, Croppies and Orangemen===

Mechanisation, tied first to water, and then to steam, power drove the growth of industry, but displaced independent weavers. In 1762, over 300 paraded through Lisburn brandishing blackthorn sticks as a protest against the threat of unemployment. In the 1780s they were gripped by the spirit of &quot;combination&quot;—the formation, in defiance of the law, of unions to press for higher piece rates. This brought workers into a sometimes uneasy relationship with the Volunteer militia.

The Volunteer militia movement, formed in response to the defence emergency caused by French intervention in the American War of Independence, served the town&#x27;s merchants and tradesmen as an opportunity to protest (with their kindred in the American colonies) the restrictive English Navigation Acts and to insist on the independence of the Irish Parliament in Dublin. In 1783 William Todd Jones, a captain of the Lisburn Fusilier Corps of Volunteers, took this patriot programme (approved at a convention in Dungannon) a step further. He successfully challenged the parliamentary nominees of the town and district&#x27;s principal landlord, the Hertfords, on a platform of a representative reform to include votes for Catholics.

In the wake of the French Revolution the cause of religious equality and representative government for Ireland was taken up in a still less compromising form by the Society of United Irishmen. The society won support of working men in the town, and of its leading Catholic family, the Teelings of Chapel Hill, wealthy linen manufacturers. Bartholomew Teeling (destined to hang) and his brother Charles, were an important connection between the largely Presbyterian &quot;United men&quot; and Catholic Defenders in rural areas. It is likely, however, that the greater strength in the district was the fraternal Orange Order, newly formed in defence of the Protestant [Church of Ireland] Ascendancy. In 1797 the Order paraded 3000 loyalists in the town before the British commander General Lake.

The neighbouring military camp at Blaris, ensured that when in 1798 the United Irishmen, decided upon insurrection, there could be no rebel demonstration in the town. Blaris supplied troops that helped ensure defeat for the forces of the &quot;Republic&quot; to the north of the town at the Battle of Antrim on June 7, and to the south at the Battle of Ballynahinch on June 12 where the &quot;Croppies&quot; had been under the command of the Lisburn linen draper, Henry Munro. For over a month, the severed heads of Munro and three of his lieutenants were displayed on pikes, one on each corner of the Market House.

=== The Victorian Town ===
The county-by-county record of pre-Famine Ireland, &quot;Hall&#x27;s Ireland: Mr and Mrs Hall&#x27;s Tour of 1840&quot;, found Lisburn recognisable as the settlement Rowden had formed more than two centuries before. Believing that between Drum Bridge and Lough Neagh the people were &quot;almost exclusively&quot; of English and Welsh extraction, the Halls ventured that in no town in Ireland were &quot;the happy effects of English taste and industry more conspicuous&quot;. With the formation in 1836 of the Lisburn Cricket Club, the Halls might have noted that English taste also extended to sport and leisure.

To the visitors the town still appeared in 1840 to consist &quot;principally of one long street&quot; (Bow Street) at the Market Square end of which stood the cathedral. An &quot;interesting and picturesque church&quot;, it contained &quot;two very remarkable monuments&quot;. One is of &quot;the great and good Jeremy Taylor&quot; (1613–1667), sometime Bishop of Down and Conor (reputed &quot;Shakespeare of the Divines&quot; and former chaplain to Charles I). The other is to the memory of Lieutenant William Dobbs killed in the capture of his vessel, HMS &quot;Drake&quot;, by the American privateer John Paul Jones (an engagement in Belfast Lough in 1778 that spurred formation of the Volunteer movement).  

The Halls would have been able to proceed the eight miles to Belfast on the newly completed Ulster Railway line. The line from Belfast was continued to Portadown and, with the completion of the Boyne Viaduct, connected with Dublin in 1855. A junction out of Lisburn at Knockmore, established further service to Banbridge and Newcastle and to Antrim and Derry. Lisburn&#x27;s present railway station, built for the Great Northern Railway Company, dates from 1878.

The new transportation links encouraged further industrial growth. In 1889, newspapers reported a rival to Barbour&#x27;s factory: a &quot;splendid new mill&quot; by Robert Stewart &amp; Son to employ over a thousand hands, with the novelty of electric lighting and &quot;toilets on every floor&quot;.

As had other Protestant-majority districts, Lisburn quickly reconciled to the union with Great Britain that followed the 1798 rebellion. Support for the Union, seen both as a guarantee of free trade and as security against Catholic-majority rule, spurred the further growth in the town of the Orange Order and helped return Hertford-approved Conservative candidates to the Westminster parliament. The political loyalty of tenants (who were to enjoy a secret ballot only from 1871) was further secured by the relative beneficence of the 3rd Marquess of Hertford. Despite a reputation of being &quot;the most thoroughgoing rove in the kingdom&quot; and spending almost all of his life on the continent, when cholera struck in 1832 Francis Seymour-Conway (1777–1842) erected a hospital and distributed medicines, blankets, clothing and other necessities throughout the estate.

===Absentee proprietors===
In 1842, Captain Richard Seymour-Conway (1800–1870), the 4th Marquess of Hertford, inherited 10 by 14 mile Lagan Valley estate on which some 4,000 tenants (and many more sub-tenants) provided an income of £60,000 (or £5 million in today&#x27;s money). Yet he was to visit it but once, and then with the wish that, &quot;pray God!&quot;, he should never have to do so again. When the edge of the Great Irish Famine reached the valley in 1847 and 1848, the Marquess declined to join the mill owners in subscribing to the relief efforts. London&#x27;s Wallace Collection, named after his illegitimate Parisian son and heir Sir Richard Wallace, is testimony to his chief passion, the acquisition of art.
Wallace (1818–1890) was created baronet in 1871 and was the Conservative and Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Lisburn from 1873 to 1885 (when Lisburn was incorporated into the new South Antrim constituency). His bequests to the people of Lisburn included Wallace Park, grounds for the Intermediate and University School (later renamed in his honour, Wallace High School), and a remodelling of the Market House. (The large residence he built on Castle Street, but never occupied, today houses offices of the South Eastern Regional College). In 1872 he donated 50 &quot;Wallace&quot; drinking fountains (cast from a sculpture of Charles-Auguste Lebourg), to Paris (on whose humanitarian relief during the German siege of 1870–1871 he had already spent a considerable fortune) and five to Lisburn where one still to be found in Castle Gardens and another in Wallace Park. The town responded with a memorial to Wallace In Castle Gardens.

In 1852, Lord Hertford&#x27;s agent, the Reverend James Stannus, the Rector of Lisburn Cathedral, had occasion to write to him suggesting a general increase in rents as punishment for the tenants both for an attack on his person and for their defiance in voting for a dissident Conservative, a free-trade &quot;Peelite&quot;. The following year the tenants sent a delegation to Hertford in Paris in a vain protest. In 1872, charges of &quot;high-handed management of the estate&quot; (the arbitrary fining and eviction of tenants, interference in elections, and discrimination against non-Anglicans) prompted Stannus&#x27;s son and successor to sue the Belfast paper, the &quot;Northern Whig&quot; for defamation. The Dublin jury found for the plaintiff only under pressure from the judge, fixing the damages at £100.

Together with failing agricultural prices, a willingness even of Orangemen to join the Irish National Land League helped turn the tables: in the 1880s agents were proposing to appease tenant with rent reductions. Under the later marquesses, and as their legal powers to dictate terms diminished, tenant-landlord relations improved.

By the new century the Irish Land Acts had effectively retired the great proprietors and their agents from the scene. In a departing gesture, in 1901, Sir John Murray Scott, heir of Lady Wallace, gave the Market House with its Assembly Rooms to Lisburn Urban District Council, for &quot;the benefit of the inhabitants of the town&quot;. The Hertford Rent Office in Castle Street was closed in 1901 and became Lisburn Town Hall.

===Ulster Volunteers ===
In July 1914, in the first of many acts of political violence Lisburn was to experience in the new century, the chancel of Lisburn Cathedral was destroyed by a bomb. It had been placed by Lilian Metge as part of a broader campaign on behalf of women&#x27;s suffrage, co-ordinated by Dorothy Evans of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union. The previous year, explosives having been found in her Belfast apartment, Evans had created uproar in court when she demanded to know why James Craig, who at that point had overseen the arming of the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) with smuggled German munitions, was not appearing on the same charges.

Lisburn and neighbouring communities raised three battalions of the UVF, the South Antrim Volunteers. They were a token of the determination of local people (in the words of Ulster&#x27;s Solemn League and Covenant) &quot;to stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland&quot;. The United Kingdom declaration of war upon Germany (August 3), paused resolution of the Home Rule Crisis, and many of Lisburn&#x27;s Volunteers would go on to serve with the 36th (Ulster) Division.

On July 12, 1916, for the first time since 1797 there was no Orange demonstration of any kind to celebrate the Williamite victory at the Boyne. The customary midnight drumming parade was abandoned, and no arches or flags were displayed. Most of the mills and factories were closed. The town responded to the news that on the first day of Somme offensive, July 1, the Ulster Division had lost 5,000 men wounded, 2,069 killed.

=== The Burnings and Partition ===

In 1920, Lisburn saw violence related to the Irish War of Independence and partition of Ireland. On 22 August, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) assassinated Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) Inspector Oswald Swanzy in Lisburn&#x27;s Market Square, as worshippers left Sunday service in the cathedral. Swanzy was among those a coroner&#x27;s inquest in Cork had held responsible for the killing of Tomás Mac Curtain, the city&#x27;s republican Lord Mayor.

Over the next three days and nights Protestant loyalist crowds looted and burned practically every Catholic business in the town, and attacked Catholic homes. There is evidence that Ulster Volunteers had helped organise the burnings. Rioters attacked firemen who tried to save Catholic property, and lorries of British soldiers sent to help the police. Brigadier-General William Pain (a former Ulster Volunteer leader) had troops guard the Catholic church and convent, but failed to take strong action to quell rioting elsewhere. The parochial house was looted, burnt out and daubed with sectarian slogans. Some Catholics were severely beaten, and a Catholic pub owner later died of gunshot wounds. A charred body was also found in the ruins of a factory.

Lisburn was likened to &quot;a bombarded town in France&quot; during the war. About 1,000 people, a third of the town&#x27;s Catholics, fled Lisburn. Many were forced to take the mountain road to Belfast where troops were already blocking off streets with barbed wire cordons, a prelude to still greater violence. Fires soon raged across Belfast and in the next few days thirty people were killed in the city (see Belfast Pogrom). As a result of the violence, Lisburn was the first town to recruit the special constables who went on to become the Ulster Special Constabulary. In October, about thirty special constables faced charges for involvement in the &quot;Swanzy riots&quot;. The last Chief Secretary for Ireland, Sir Hamar Greenwood, admitted that &quot;some hundred special constables in Lisburn threatened to resign&quot; in protest. Charges were not pursued.

On the day that a 700-year English presence in the south of Ireland ended with the formal hand over of Dublin Castle to the government of the Irish Free State, 16 January 1922, Lisburn celebrated the centenary of the local &quot;hero of the Indian Mutiny&quot;, John Nicholson (1822–1857). Under a marble relief of his final assault on Delhi&#x27;s Kashmir Gate, a memorial in the Cathedral credited Nicholson with dealing a &quot;death blow to the greatest danger that ever threatened the British Empire&quot;. For James Craig, now the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, and for other dignitaries speaking at the unveiling of a new statue in Market Square, the East India Company Brigadier (depicted with both sword and gun in hand) was &quot;a symbol of the defence of Empire in Ireland as well as India.

In April the following year crowds gathered again to dedicate the Victory Memorial in Castle Gardens.

===From town to city===
As the linen industry was hugely dependent on the export market, Lisburn and the surrounding area was hit hard in the 1930s by the worldwide economic depression. The pattern of unemployment, half-time contracts and reduced wages was fully reversed only by new wartime mobilisation. While some of the town and region linen mills helped produce material for uniforms, boot laces, kit bags, bandages, tents, and parachutes, others were converted to churning out munitions, with women undertaking much of the work. 

The Second World War struck close to Lisburn with the Belfast Blitz of April and May 1941. The town and the surrounding area was flooded by thousands of evacuees all of whom, as one member of the Lisburn Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service recalled, had to be &quot;fed, housed, deloused, marshalled, bathed, clothed, pacified and brought back to normal&quot;.

In the post-war decades the demand for linen declined (precipitously after World War Two) in response to new textiles and changing fashion. With a workforce reduced to just 85, the Barbour mill in Hilden finally closed in 2006.

The population of Lisburn, which in 1951 was still just 15,000, nonetheless continued to grow. In part this was a consequence of the expansion of the town boundary lines in 1973, and of a dramatic increase in public authority housing with overspill from Belfast. As stock improved, the town retained few examples of the terraced housing built by the mill owners in the nineteenth century. Development did see the loss of some historic landmarks: the Victorian Court House in Railway Street, the Sacred Heart of Mary Grammar School in Castle Street and, in Linenhall Street, the Independent Order of Good Templars hall and the weaving factory of William Coulson.

The opening of the M1 motorway in 1962 further integrated Lisburn into the greater Belfast commercial and residential area.

In 1989 the new edge-of-town Sprucefield retail park opened. The centre was virtually destroyed in January 1991 in a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) incendiary attack. Marks and Spencer, the principal anchor was spared, but the three other major stores were destroyed.

On what was once known (because of the production of sulphuric acid bleach) as Vitriol Island in the middle of the River Lagan, the last remnants of the Island Spinning Company were demolished in the early 1990s. The Lagan Valley Island Complex was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, in November 2001.

A borough since 1973, Lisburn was granted city status in 2002 as part of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden jubilee celebrations.

===Thiepval Barracks===
First built in 1940, Thiepval Barracks is a large military complex on the edge of town was named after the village of Thiepval in Northern France, the site of the Ulster Division&#x27;s heaviest losses in 1916 on the Somme.

In early 1970 the Thiepval Barracks became home to 39 Infantry Brigade and provided the headquarters for the locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment. From August 1969, the Brigade, as 39 Airportable Brigade, was involved in The Troubles in Northern Ireland, eventually taking on responsibility, under HQ Northern Ireland, for an area including Belfast and the eastern side of the province, but excluding the South Armagh border region. From September 1970, it was commanded by (then) Brigadier Frank Kitson.

In Lisburn&#x27;s last casualties of the conflict, a soldier was killed and 31 people were injured when the(IRA) exploded two car bombs in the barracks on October 7, 1996.

The barracks remain home to 38th (Irish) Brigade.

=== The Troubles ===
With communities across Northern Ireland, from the end of the 1960s Lisburn suffered through three decades of political violence, &quot;The Troubles&quot;. For Lisburn the first killings came in 1976: in the course of the year, five Catholic residents died as a result of gun and bomb attacks by the Ulster Defence Association and (a new) Ulster Volunteer Force, loyalist paramilitary groups that subsequently entered their own feud. In 1978 the IRA murdered a Royal Ulster Constabulary officer at his home in front of his family. It was the first in a series of targeted assassinations of security-force personnel in the town that culminated in the 1988 Lisburn Van Bombing: five off-duty British soldiers killed at the end of a charity run in Market Square. The Troubles in the town claimed a total of 32 lives.

===Lisburn in the 21st century===

As elsewhere, private investment in Lisburn has shifted employment away from traditional industries toward services. Just under 10% of the town and district&#x27;s workforce remains in manufacturing, but it is a dynamic sector that includes precision-engineering exporters. Recent decades have seen very considerable public investment and new public service jobs, now accounting for a third of the district&#x27;s overall employment.

After receiving city status in 2008, in the 2016 reform of local government in Northern Ireland Lisburn was combined with residential areas of broadly similar social and political complexion bordering Belfast to the south and east. The fusion produced Lisburn City and Castlereagh District. According to measures devised by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, the district ranked among the least socially and economically deprived in the province.

In the third election to new 40-seat Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council, in May 2023, the twelve seats representing Lisburn returned a reduced unionist majority: four seats for the DUP (a loss of one) and two for the UUP (a loss of two) and an independent unionist. The cross-community Alliance Party held gained one to hold three; the moderate nationalist SDLP retained a seat, and for the first time Lisburn returned a Sinn Féin councillor. Following the election, in June 2023 Gary McCleave, who was re-elected to represent the Killultagh DEA became &quot;the first ever Sinn Féin councillor to hold a mayoral position in Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council&quot;: he was named deputy mayor.

Following the decision of the sitting DUP MP and party leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, not to stand in the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Lisburn&#x27;s Lagan Valley constituency returned for the first time a non-unionist, the Alliance Party&#x27;s Sorcha Eastwood.

== Administration ==
Lisburn is the administrative centre of Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council area.

In elections for the Westminster Parliament the city falls mainly into the Lagan Valley constituency.

Two District Electoral Areas cover the city and surrounding areas. Lisburn North (Derriaghy, Harmony Hill, Hilden, Lambeg, Magheralave, Wallace Park) and Lisburn South (Ballymacash, Ballymacoss, Knockmore, Lagan Valley, Lisnagarvey, Old Warren). In the 2023 local elections the following were elected to represent the two DEAs:


The headquarters of the British Army in Northern Ireland at Thiepval Barracks and the headquarters of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service are located in the city.

== Demography==
===2011 Census===
On Census Day (27 March 2011) the usually resident population of Lisburn City Settlement was 45,370 accounting for 2.51% of the NI total.
* 97.51% were from the white (including Irish Traveller) ethnic group;
* 22.24% belong to or were brought up Catholic and 67.32% belong to or were brought up in a &#x27;Protestant and other (non-Catholic) Christian (including Christian related)&#x27; and
* 67.65% indicated that they had a British national identity, 11.32% had an Irish national identity and 29.04% had a Northern Irish national identity.
Respondents could indicate more than one national identity.
On Census Day, in Lisburn City Settlement, considering the population aged 3 years old and over:
* 3.72% had some knowledge of Irish;
* 6.51% had some knowledge of Ulster-Scots; and
* 3.25% did not have English as their first language.

===2021 Census===
On Census Day (2021) the usually resident population of Lisburn City Settlement was 51,447:
* 26.84% (13,808) belong to or were brought up Catholic and 56.37% (29,003) belong to or were brought up in a &#x27;Protestant and other (non-Catholic) Christian (including Christian related)&#x27;, 1.84% belong to other religions and 14.95% and no religious background
* 43.55% (22,406) indicated that they had a British national identity, 13.32% (6,856) had an Irish national identity, 20.04% (10,312) had a Northern Irish national identity, 11.04% (5,680) had a British and Northern Irish only, 1.29% (664) had an Irish and Northern Irish only, and 1.78% (917) had a British, Irish and Northern Irish only.

==Schools and colleges==
The Classical School in Bow Lane, founded 1756 and mastered for fifty-six years by the Huguenot and Anglican cleric and scholar Saumaurez Dubourdieu, was the first school of note in Lisburn. Friends&#x27; School, founded for Quaker children, followed in 1774. Comparable grammar-school education was not provided for Catholic children until the Convent of the Sacred Heart of Mary started boarding pupils in a house in Castle Street in 1870, and not for other children in the town until 1880 when Sir Richard Wallace founded the Intermediate and University School on the Antrim (renamed Wallace High School in his honour in 1942).

The first Lisburn school which did not ask pupils whether they attended church, chapel or meeting was that founded on the Dublin Road by John Crossley in 1810. Known then as the Male Free School, it was the first free school in Ulster to be based on the Bell and Lancaster monitorial system.

A school for poor children, established by Jane Hawkshaw in 1821 with the support of the 3rd marquess, taught no catechism and made no attempt at religious instruction. It adopted that principle that &quot;while so great diversity prevails on this subject, it [is] best to separate religion from the instructing in reading, writing, arithmetic and sewing&quot;. Religious instruction was to be left to &quot;the parents, with the assistance of their respective teachers&quot;. It is a principle that the government tried, but in the face of church opposition failed, to realise in its original 1830 plans for an Irish system of National Schools.

Another exception to control by the church education authorities was Hilden School, established under mill management by William Barbour in 1829.

Today, Fort Hill Primary and Fort Hill College make a conscious effort to surmount principal sectarian divide in the town through a system of &quot;integrated education&quot;. Children from Catholic and Protestant homes in Lisburn are otherwise taught, with limited exception, separately on a pattern that, by the mid-nineteenth century, had been established throughout Ireland.

The Lisburn Technical Institute, the forerunner of South Eastern Regional College, opened in Castle Street in 1914.

== Churches ==

Lisburn is notable for its large number of churches, with 132 churches listed in the Lisburn City Council area. Christ Church Cathedral, commonly referred to as Lisburn Cathedral, is the diocesan church for the Church of Ireland bishopric of Connor.

The principal Roman Catholic Church in Lisburn is St Patrick&#x27;s on Chapel Hill dedicated in 1900. For Presbyterians the senior congregation remains that of the First Presbyterian Church, off Market Square, built in 1768, and enlarged and remodelled in 1873 and 1970. For the Methodists, it is the Seymour Street Church opened on ground donated by Sir Richard Wallace in 1875.

== Transport ==

=== Rail ===
The Lisburn railway station was opened on 12 August 1839. Express trains taking 10–15 minutes to reach Belfast&#x27;s Great Victoria Street. The train also links the city directly with Newry, Portadown, Lurgan, Moira and Bangor. The station also has services to Dublin Connolly in the city of Dublin, with three trains per day stopping at the station. All railway services from the station are provided by Northern Ireland Railways, a subsidiary of Translink. The city is also served by Hilden railway station.
=== Bus ===
Ulsterbus provides various bus services that connect the city with Belfast city centre, which lies eight miles northeast. These services generally operate either along Belfast&#x27;s Lisburn Road or through the Falls area in west Belfast. In addition to long-distance services to Craigavon, Newry and Banbridge, there is also a network of buses that serve the rural areas around the city, such as Glenavy and Dromara; as well as an hourly bus service 6:00 am – 6:00 pm Monday-Saturday to Belfast International Airport.
The city has a network of local buses, serving the local housing developments and amenities. These are operated by Ulsterbus.

A new &quot;Buscentre&quot;, provided by the regional public transport provider Translink, opened on 30 June 2008 at the corner of Smithfield Street and the Hillsborough Road. It replaced the shelters that formerly stood in Smithfield Square.

=== Road ===
The city is located on the Belfast-Dublin corridor, being connected with the former by the M1 motorway from which it can be accessed through junctions 3, 6, 7 and 8. The A1 road to Newry and Dublin deviates from the M1 at the Sprucefield interchange, which is positioned one mile southeast of the city centre. An inner orbital route was formed throughout the 1980s which has permitted the city centre to operate a one-way system as well as the pedestrianisation of the Bow Street shopping precinct. In addition to this, a feeder road leading from Milltown on the outskirts of Belfast to Ballymacash in north Lisburn, was opened in 2006. This route connects with the A512 and permits traffic from Lisburn to easily access the M1 at junction 3 (Dunmurry) thus relieving pressure on the southern approaches to the city.

=== Inland waterways ===
The Lagan Canal passes through Lisburn. This connected the port of Belfast to Lough Neagh, reaching Lisburn in 1763 (although the full route to Lough Neagh was not complete until 1793). Prior to World War II the canal was an important transportation route for goods, averaging over 307,000 tons of coal per year in the 1920s. Following competition from road transport, the canal was formally closed to navigation in 1958, and grew derelict. A short stretch and lock in front of Lisburn Council offices was restored to use in 2001.

=== Cycling ===
Lisburn is served by National Cycle Route 9, connecting the city with Belfast with Newry.

== Shopping ==

Bow Street Mall, on Bow Street, houses over 60 stores, many eateries (including a food court). Sprucefield Shopping Centre and Sprucefield Retail Park are two large retail parks located just outside the city centre.

== Townlands ==
Townlands are traditional land divisions used in Ireland. As well as Lisnagarvy, Lisburn covers all or part of the following townlands.

County Antrim:
*Aghalislone ()
*Aghnahough (from &quot;Achadh na hUamha&quot;, &#x27;field of the cave&#x27;)
*Ballymacoss or Ballymacash (from &quot;Baile Mhic Coise&quot;, &#x27;MacCoise&#x27;s townland&#x27;)
*Clogher (from &quot;Clochar&quot;, &#x27;stony place&#x27;)
*Knockmore (from &quot;An Cnoc Mór&quot;, &#x27;the great hill&#x27;)
*Lambeg (from &quot;Lann Bheag&quot;, &#x27;little church&#x27;)
*Lissue or Teraghafeeva (from &quot;Lios Áedha&quot;, &#x27;Áed&#x27;s fort&#x27; and &quot;Tír Átha Fiodhach&quot;, &#x27;wooded land of the ford&#x27;)
*Magheralave (from &quot;Machaire Shléibhe&quot;, &#x27;plain of the mountain grass&#x27; or &quot;Machaire Léimh&quot;, &#x27;plain of the elms&#x27;)
*Old Warren
*Tonagh (from &quot;An Tamhnach&quot;, &#x27;the grassy field&#x27;)

County Down:
*Blaris (from &quot;Bláras&quot;, a field or battlefield)
*Ballintine (from &quot;Baile an tSiáin&quot;, &#x27;townland of the fairy mound&#x27;)
*Ballymullan (from &quot;Baile Uí Mhaoláin&quot;, &#x27;O&#x27;Mullan&#x27;s townland&#x27;)
*Largymore (from &quot;An Leargaidh Mhór&quot;, &#x27;the big slope&#x27;)
*Magherageery (from &quot;Machaire na gCaorach&quot;, &#x27;plain of the sheep&#x27;)

== Climate ==
As with the rest of the British Isles, Lisburn experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is at Hillsborough.

Averaged over the period 1971–2000 the warmest day of the year at Hillsborough will reach , although 9 out of 10 years should record a temperature of or above.

Averaged over the same period, the coldest night of the year typically falls to and on 37 nights air frost was observed.

Typically annual rainfall falls just short of 900 mm, with at least 1 mm falling on 154 days of the year.

Water can be supplied from Dams and nearby rivers thanks to the rainfall and mountains. In the 19th Century, Duncan&#x27;s Dam provided the town with water and now serves as a free public park.

== Health care ==

The main hospital in the city is the Lagan Valley Hospital, which provides Accident and Emergency services to the area. The hospital lost its acute services in 2006. Residents now must travel to Belfast for acute surgery. The Lagan Valley lost its 24-hour A&amp;E from 1 August 2011 due to a shortage of Junior Doctors. It will now instead be open 9:00 am – 8:00 pm and will be closed on weekends. This has caused much controversy as residents of the city will now have to travel to Belfast or Craigavon. Primary care in the area is provided by the Lisburn Health Centre, which opened in 1977. The city lies within the South Eastern Health and Social Care Board area.

<doc id="355074" wikidata="Q691685" url="?curid=355074" title="Kirkcaldy">
<text>Kirkcaldy ( ; ; ) is a town and former royal burgh in Fife, on the east coast of Scotland. It is about north of Edinburgh and south-southwest of Dundee. The town had a recorded population of 49,460 in 2011, making it Fife&#x27;s second-largest settlement and the 11th most populous settlement in Scotland.

Kirkcaldy has long been nicknamed the Lang Toun (; Scots for &quot;long town&quot;) in reference to the early town&#x27;s main street, as indicated on maps from the 16th and 17th centuries. The street would finally reach a length of nearly , connecting the burgh to the neighbouring settlements of Linktown, Pathhead, Sinclairtown and Gallatown, which became part of the town in 1876. The formerly separate burgh of Dysart was also later absorbed into Kirkcaldy in 1930 under an act of Parliament.

The area around Kirkcaldy has been inhabited since the Bronze Age. The first document to refer to the town is from 1075, when Malcolm III granted the settlement to the church of Dunfermline. David I later gave the burgh to Dunfermline Abbey, which had succeeded the church: a status which was officially recognised by Robert I in 1327. The town only gained its independence from Abbey rule when it was created a royal burgh by Charles I in 1644.

From the early 16th century, the establishment of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town&#x27;s early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries. The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town&#x27;s most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer until well into the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the linoleum industry and other manufacturing restricted its growth thereafter.

Today, the town is a major service centre for the central Fife area. Public facilities include a main leisure centre, theatre, museum and art gallery, three public parks and an ice rink. Kirkcaldy is also known as the birthplace of social philosopher and economist Adam Smith who wrote his magnum opus &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; in the town. In the early 21st century, employment is dominated by the service sector: the biggest employer in the town is PayWizard, formerly known as MGT plc (call centre). Other main employers include NHS Fife, Forbo (linoleum and vinyl floor coverings), Fife College, Whitworths (flour millers) and Smith Anderson (paper making).

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name Kirkcaldy means &quot;place of the hard fort&quot; or &quot;place of Caled&#x27;s fort&quot;. It is derived from the Pictish * meaning &quot;fort&quot;, *, which is Pictish &quot;hard&quot; or a personal name, and , a suffix meaning &quot;place of&quot;. may describe the fort itself or be an epithet for a local &quot;hard&quot; ruler. An interpretation of the last element as &quot;din&quot; (again meaning &quot;fort&quot;) rather than &quot;-in&quot; is incorrect. The Old Statistical Account gives a derivation from culdee, which has been repeated in later publications, but this is also incorrect.

===Early===
The discovery of 11 Bronze Age cist burials which date from 2500 BC and 500 BC suggests that this is the most ancient funerary site in the area. What probably made this location ideal was its natural terraces stretching away from the sand bay, and the close proximity of the East Burn to the north and the West (Tiel) Burn to the south. Four Bronze Age burials dating from around 4000 BC have also been found around the site of the unmarked Bogely or Dysart Standing Stone to the east of the present A92 road. Although there are few Roman sites in Fife, a Roman camp was known to exist at Carberry Farm on the town&#x27;s outskirts.

The Battle of Raith in AD 596 was once believed to have taken place to the west of the town&#x27;s site but the theory no longer holds support. The battle was said to have been fought between the Angles and an alliance, led by King Áedán mac Gabráin of Dál Riata, of Scots, Picts and Britons.

=== Medieval ===

The first document to recognise the town was issued in 1075, when the King of Scots, Malcolm III (reigned 1058–93) granted the shire of Kirkcaladunt, among other gifts, to the church at Dunfermline. The residents were expected to pay dues and taxes for the church&#x27;s general upkeep. Two charters, later confirmed by Malcolm&#x27;s son David I in 1128 and 1130, refer to Kircalethin and Kirkcaladunit respectively, but do not indicate their locations.

In 1304, a weekly market and annual fair for Kirkcaldy was proposed by the Abbot of Dunfermline to King Edward I, during a period of English rule in Scotland from 1296 to 1306. During these discussions, the town may have been referred to as &quot;one of the most ancient of burghs&quot;. This status as a burgh dependent on Dunfermline Abbey was later confirmed in 1327 by Robert I, King of Scots.

A charter granted in 1363 by David II, King of Scots (reigned 1329–71), awarded the burgh the right to trade across the regality of Dunfermline. This charter allowed the burgesses of Kirkcaldy to purchase and sell goods to the burgesses of the three other regality burghs – Queensferry, Dunfermline and Musselburgh – that belonged to the Abbey. By 1451, Kirkcaldy was awarded feu-ferme status. Under the status, responsibility would now lie with the bailies and council to deal with the routine administration of the town and its fiscal policies; conditional on an annual payment of two and a half marks (33s 4d) to the Abbot of Dunfermline.

===16th to 18th centuries===
At the beginning of the 16th century, the town became an important trading port. The town took advantage of its east coast location, which facilitated trading contacts with the Low Countries, the Baltic region, England, and Northern France. The feu-ferme charter of 1451 between the Abbot of Dunfermline and the burgesses of Kirkcaldy mentioned a small but functioning harbour; it is not known when this harbour was established, or whether it was always located at the mouth of the East Burn. According to treasurers&#x27; accounts of the early 16th century, timber imported via the harbour—possibly from the Baltic countries—was used at Falkland Palace and Edinburgh Castle, as well as in shipbuilding.

Raw materials such as hides, wool, skins, herring, salmon, coal and salt were exported from the town until well into the 17th century. Ships from Kirkcaldy brought wine and spices from Spanish ports including Cadiz. In April 1598, the &quot;Grace of God&quot;, belonging to James Birrell of Kirkcaldy, was attacked off the Cape St. Vincent by the English &quot;Green Dragon&quot; of Bristol. Birrell&#x27;s ship sank and the mariners who reach the shore were in danger of being made captive by Turkish authorities.

A charter issued by Charles I granting royal burgh status in 1644 resulted in the end of the Abbey&#x27;s jurisdiction over the town. As a gesture, the king bequeathed of common muir suitable for &quot;bleaching of linen, drying of clothes, recreation and perpetuity&quot;. In 1638, under the reign of Charles I, the town subscribed to the National Covenant, which opposed the introduction of episcopacy and patronage in the Presbyterian church. Support for the Covenanting cause cost the town over 250 men at the Battle of Kilsyth in 1645. The continuing civil wars killed at least another 480 men and led to the loss of many of the harbour&#x27;s trading vessels. By 1660, this left the town with only twelve registered ships, down from 100 it is claimed were recorded between 1640 and 1644.

Towards the end of the 17th century, the economy recovered, with growth in manufacturing. During this period, Daniel Defoe described Kirkcaldy as a &quot;larger, more populous, and better built town than ... any on this coast&quot;. A shipbuilding revival produced 38 vessels between 1778 and 1793. In the mid-19th century, whaling became important to the town for a short time. In 1813, the first Kirkcaldy whaling ship, &quot;The Earl Percy&quot;, sailed north to the Davis Strait; the town&#x27;s last whaler, &quot;The Brilliant&quot;, was sold in 1866 to Peterhead, bringing an end to the industry. Construction of a new turnpike from Pettycur to Newport-on-Tay via Cupar in 1790, while improving only one section of Fife&#x27;s isolated road system, brought a huge increase in traffic along Kirkcaldy&#x27;s High Street, and helped to strengthen the town&#x27;s position.
===Modern===
For most of the 19th century, the main industries in the town were flax spinning and linen weaving. To cope with increasing imports of flax, timber and hemp, and exports of coal, salt and linen, between 1843 and 1846 a new wet dock and pier was built at the harbour. In 1847 a canvas manufacturer, Michael Nairn, took out a licence on Frederick Walton&#x27;s patent for the production of floorcloth, and opened a factory in nearby Pathhead. When the patent expired in 1876, Nairn and other floorcloth manufacturers began the manufacture of linoleum. Production of both floorcloth and linoleum occupied seven factories in the town by 1883, employing 1,300. A further expansion of the harbour was completed between 1906 and 1908, for another increase in linoleum and coal. The smell of the linoleum factories was notorious, giving rise to the famous lines in Mary Campbell Smith&#x27;s 1913 poem The Boy in the Train: &quot;For I ken mysel&#x27; by the queer-like smell / That the next stop&#x27;s Kirkcaddy!&quot;.
The expansion of the town led in 1876 to the extension of the royal burgh&#x27;s boundaries. The town absorbed its neighbouring settlements of Linktown, in the parish of Abbotshall; Invertiel in the parish of Kinghorn; and Pathhead, Sinclairtown and Gallatown in the parish of Dysart. These formerly separate settlements had once been forbidden by the old guild rights to sell their goods in Kirkcaldy. In 1922–1923 a seawall and esplanade were constructed, funded by the Unemployment Grants Commission and built by unemployed residents. In 1930, the town would further expand to include the former royal burgh of Dysart under the (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. xciii) when its own town council became bankrupt.

During the 1950s and 1960s, new housing estates were built north-west of the town. This was followed by the redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s and 1970s, which destroyed much of the old high street. There was speculation that the town&#x27;s population could increase to around 55–60,000 by 1970. This did not happen: a decline in the linoleum industry in the mid-1960s led to a decrease in population, from a peak of 53,750 in 1961 to 47,962 in 1981.

In the 21st century, Kirkcaldy remains an important centre for the surrounding areas, with a Museum and Art Gallery, three public parks and shopping facilities. The town also hosts the annual Links Market, commonly known as &quot;Europe&#x27;s longest street fair&quot;. The production of linoleum continues, though on a greatly reduced scale, under Swiss ownership (Forbo Holding AG). Kirkcaldy Harbour, which closed in 1992, re-opened in October 2011 to cargo ships. A project between Carr&#x27;s Flour Mills, the parent of Hutchison&#x27;s, Forth Ports (owners of the harbour) and Transport Scotland, will allow Carr&#x27;s to bring in wheat via the harbour and remove a quarter of its lorries from the roads every year.

==Governance==

The grant of feu-ferme status in the middle of the 15th century meant that the town could deal with its own administrative issues and fiscal policies for the first time. The first mention of a town council was around 1582. The head courts of the burghs met either in the Common Muir (the surviving portion of the land now known as Volunteers&#x27; Green) or in the Tolbooth on Tolbooth Street, particularly in the summer months. When Kirkcaldy was awarded royal burgh status in 1644, the duties of the provost were initially performed by bailies, councillors, and magistrates. The first Lord Provost, Robert Whyt, was elected to the post around 1658. The burgh was one of four in Scotland to use two coats of arms, introduced in 1673. One bears the motto &quot;Vigilando Munio&quot; (&quot;I secure by watching&quot;), and the other displays the figure of Saint Bryce, Kirkcaldy&#x27;s patron saint.

Kirkcaldy enjoyed royal burgh status until this rank was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, in favour of a three-tier system of regions and districts. The royal burgh merged into Kirkcaldy District, which was one of three districts within the Fife region. The district council was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994 when the region became a unitary council area. The new Fife Council adopted the areas of the former districts as council management areas and created area committees to represent each.

Kirkcaldy is represented by several tiers of elected government. It is divided into six community council areas: Bennochy and Hayfield, Dysart, Kirkcaldy East, Kirkcaldy North, Kirkcaldy West, and Templehall. Of these, only Dysart, Kirkcaldy North and Kirkcaldy West have active community councils, which form the lowest tier, and whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. Together with the nearby village of Thornton, the town forms the civil parish of Kirkcaldy and Dysart, although civil parishes now have no administrative functions, and are used mainly for statistical purposes.

Fife Council, based in Glenrothes, the unitary local authority for Kirkcaldy, is the executive, deliberative, and legislative body responsible for local governance. Kirkcaldy Town House is the main administrative headquarters for the Kirkcaldy area within the local authority. The Kirkcaldy area also sends 11 councillors, elected from three wards, to Fife Council. Beyond the tiers of local government, the Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters from the Parliament of the United Kingdom, such as education, health, and justice.

The first Member of Parliament to be elected to the House of Commons from Kirkcaldy was Colonel Abercrombie in 1710. Prior to the Act of Union in 1707, Kirkcaldy sent a Member of Parliament to the old Scottish Parliament, which usually met in Edinburgh. Kirkcaldy was represented by the constituency of Dysart Burghs from 1707 to 1832, which was formed from the burgh itself and three other burghs, Dysart, Kinghorn, and Burntisland. Under the Reform Act 1832, the constituency of Kirkcaldy Burghs was created. Robert Ferguson of Raith was re-elected as Member of Parliament. Kirkcaldy forms part of the county constituency of Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy, electing one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom by the first past the post system. Since the 2017 General Election, Lesley Laird of the Labour Party has been Member of Parliament for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.

Kirkcaldy forms part of the Kirkcaldy constituency of the Scottish Parliament (or &quot;Holyrood&quot;), and is one of nine within the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region. Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament by the first–past–the–post system of election, and the region elects seven additional members to produce a form of proportional representation. The Kirkcaldy seat was won at the 2011 Scottish Parliament elections by David Torrance for the Scottish National Party (SNP). Following a review of Scottish Parliament constituency boundaries, the Kirkcaldy constituency was extended along the coast, taking in the Buckhaven, Methil, and East and West Wemyss villages ward, ahead of the 2011 elections. Prior to Brexit in 2020 it was part of the pan-Scotland European Parliament constituency, which elected seven Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).

==Geography==
Kirkcaldy curves around a sandy cove between the Tiel (West) Burn to the south and the East Burn to the north, on a bay facing southeast onto the Firth of Forth. The town lies south-southeast of Glenrothes, east-northeast of Dunfermline, west-southwest of Dundee and north-northeast of Edinburgh. The town adopted its nickname of the &quot;lang toun&quot; from the single street, recorded on early maps of the 16th and 17th centuries. The street eventually reached a length of nearly , linking the burgh to its neighbouring suburbs of Linktown, Pathhead, Sinclairtown and Gallatown.

Historians are not sure where the medieval centre of Kirkcaldy was located, but it may have been at the corner of Kirk Wynd and the High Street. This would have been the site of the town&#x27;s Mercat cross and focal point of the burgh. The linear market was important not only to the town itself but to the nearby hinterland. The main thoroughfare was either paved or cobbled, with flagstones covering small burns running down the hill towards the sea across the High Street. Running back from the High Street were burgage plots or &quot;rigs&quot; of the burgesses; these narrow strips of land were at the front and to the rear of the houses. On the sea side of the High Street, plots may have served as beaching grounds for individual tenements. The plots on the other side of the High Street rose steeply to the terracing of the Lomond foothills. A back lane running behind the plots from Kirk Wynd went to the west end of the High Street in a southerly direction. This lane would in time be developed as Hill Street. At the top of Kirk Wynd was the Parish Church of St Bryce, now known as the Old Kirk, overlooking the small settlement.

The small burns that are tributaries to the East Burn contributed to the draining of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. The burn emerges from a deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison&#x27;s Flour Mills before running parallel to the harbour wall and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison&#x27;s buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to the burn. The flour millers chose this area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than for the need to use the burn to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills. This burn flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally it was used to create Raith Lake (with its tributary, the Dronachy Burn). The mill owners in Linktown also made use of the burn.

==Demography==
Towards the end of the 16th century, a detailed assessment on the size of the townscape was carried out. The first estimate of the parish population in 1639 was between 3,000 and 3,200 and around 3,400 by 1691. At the beginning of the 18th century, the population declined. A census by Webster&#x27;s &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Scotland&quot; in 1755, recorded an estimate of 2,296 in the parish. By the time of the first nationwide UK census in 1801, the population had risen to 3,248. The population of the burgh was recorded as 4,785 in the 1841 Census, and had risen to 34,079 by 1901. By the time of the 1951 Census, the figure stood at 49,050.

According to the 2001 UK Census, the census locality of Kirkcaldy has a total resident population of 46,912 representing 13.4% of Fife&#x27;s total population. It hosts 21,365 households. 14.8% were married couples living together, 16.4% were one-person households, 18.8% were co-habiting couples and 7.9% were lone parents. A 2010 assessment estimated that the town had a population of 49,560. This had increased to 49,709 by the time of the 2011 UK Census. The total population in the wider Kirkcaldy area was estimated at 59,784 in 2016, with a projected increase of 18% by 2026. The number of households in the Kirkcaldy area in 2016 was recorded at 29,246; 67% of which were owner occupied, 27% social rented and 5% private rented. 36% of people live alone and 16.1% are on a low income. The median weekly income is calculated at £335 for the area.

The place of birth of the town&#x27;s residents was 96.52% United Kingdom (including 87.15% from Scotland), 0.28% Republic of Ireland, 1.18% from other European Union countries, and 1.86% from elsewhere in the world. The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 40.13% in full-time employment, 12.17% in part-time employment, 4.79% self-employed, 5.68% unemployed, 2.57% students with jobs, 3.06% students without jobs, 15.70% retired, 5.51% looking after home or family, 6.68% permanently sick or disabled, and 3.71% economically inactive for other reasons. Compared with the average demography of Scotland, Kirkcaldy has low proportions of immigrants, and has higher proportions for people over 75 years old.

In 2010, more than 7,000 people claimed benefits in the Kirkcaldy area; around 90 fewer than in 2009 but 500 more than the pre-recession average for 2008. Recent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) figures indicate that the most deprived datazone in Fife is Gallatown and Sinclairtown which has a rank of 82, meaning that it is amongst the 5% most deprived areas in Scotland. Linktown, Seafield, Hayfield, Smeaton and Templehall East areas in Kirkcaldy fall within the 5–10% banding of most deprived communities in Scotland.

In June 2017, there was a recorded 1,000 Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) claimants in the Kirkcaldy area representing a 2.8% rate, which was higher than the Fife and Scottish averages.

==Economy==
The first industries to develop in the town were coal mining and salt panning, which date back to the early 16th century. Early manufacturing both in Kirkcaldy and neighbouring Pathhead consisted of coarse cloth and nailmaking; the latter of which went to the Royal Master of Works for repairs at Holyrood Palace until the 17th century. Linen weaving, which began in 1672, became important to the town, with yarn imported from Hamburg and Bremen. The pottery industry, which was originally established in 1714 as an offshoot of the Linktown Brick and Tile Works, was centred around Linktown, Gallatown and Sinclairtown. The Fife Pottery, built by Andrew and Archibald Grey in 1817, produced Wemyss Ware, named after the family who owned Wemyss Castle.

The production of heavy canvas was started in 1828 by Michael Nairn at a small factory. Influenced by a visit to Bristol, Nairn started to make floorcloth at his new factory at Pathhead in 1847, where his company pioneered the use of ovens to season the floorcloth and reduce production times. When the patent belonging to Frederick Walton expired, Nairn&#x27;s were able to manufacture linoleum from 1877 onwards. Other factories producing floorcloth and later linoleum were established by former employees of Michael Nairn.

Approximately 22,200 people work in the Kirkcaldy area, the majority of which are in Kirkcaldy itself and to a lesser degree in Burntisland. This represents approximately 13.6% of the 163,000 jobs in Fife. The local economy is dominated by service sector businesses. Other important economic sectors in the Kirkcaldy area are retailing and construction with moderate levels of jobs in financial and business services. The largest employer in the town is MGt plc. Other important local employers include NHS Fife, Forbo (vinyl floor coverings), Fife College (education), Whitworths Holdings (flour millers) and Smith Anderson (paper making). The principal industrial and business estates include Mitchleston, Randolph, Hayfield, and John Smith Business Park. Local industrial activity has also increased with the reopening in 2011 of Kirkcaldy Harbour to cargo ships. This has been facilitated through a partnership between Forth Ports Ltd (the owners of the harbour), Hutchison&#x27;s parent company of Carr&#x27;s Flour Mills, and Transport Scotland, who provided a freight facilities grant of over £800,000. The work included new silos and conveyors to allow fast delivery from coastal ships.

Kirkcaldy&#x27;s town centre, which serves a large catchment area of around 130,000 residents within a 20-minute drive, is the largest in Fife in terms of retail floor space. Eligible businesses voted in favour of a BID (Business Improvement District) scheme for the town centre in 2010. The High Street, which runs parallel to the Esplanade, is home to the Mercat Shopping Centre. A regeneration programme to upgrade the appearance of the High Street was completed in late 2011. A separate project has also created a &#x27;green corridor&#x27; to link the main railway station and bus station with the High Street. The budget for the entire project was £4 million, £2 million of which was provided through the Scottish Government&#x27;s Town Centre Regeneration Fund.

An out-of-town retail park constructed in 1997 north-west of the town on Chapel Level, off the A92 is home to a number of warehouse retailers. The retail park was purchased by Hammerson, a London-based property developer for £75 million in April 2005.

==Culture==
Kirkcaldy Galleries is home to the town&#x27;s museum and art gallery and central library. The building opened in 1925 under its former name of Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery and was extended to provide a main library in 1928. In 2011, the building was closed to allow a £2.4 million renovation which was completed in June 2013. The work resulted in the integration of the facilities within the building through a single entrance and reception desk. The building also adopted its present name.

The Adam Smith Theatre, the town&#x27;s main auditorium, plays host to theatrical and musical productions as well as showing a selection of arthouse and commercial films. Originally known as the Adam Smith Halls, the theatre adopted its present name in 1973 after a renovation of the building in time for the 250th anniversary of the birth of Adam Smith. The King&#x27;s Theatre, originally opened in 1904 and derelict for some time is currently being redeveloped to become the biggest venue in Fife.

The Links Market originated as a farmers market on Links Street, before moving to its present site in 1903 on the Esplanade (then known as Sands Road). The market visits the town every April and celebrated its 700th anniversary in 2004. Kirkcaldy has had a twin-town link with Ingolstadt in Germany since
September 1962. There are plans for a joint celebration to recognise the 50th anniversary of the town&#x27;s twinning with Ingolstadt in 2012.

There are three main public parks in Kirkcaldy.

:Beveridge Park, to the west of the town is a park created from the existing Robbie&#x27;s Park, and land purchased from the Raith Estate. This was part of a £50,000 bequest from linen manufacturer and provost Michael Beveridge, who died in 1890. On 24 September 1892 a crowd of over 10,000 came to see the park&#x27;s opening hosted by his widow, the provost, magistrates, and the town council of the royal burgh. The park includes a boating lake, a formal garden with fountain, a skateboard park, rugby ground, football pitches and woodland walks. The park was awarded a green flag award in both 2010 and 2011. Kirkcaldy parkrun has been held every Saturday in the park since February 2015.

:Ravenscraig Park, to the east of the town was formed from the estate of Dysart House. The grounds were bequeathed to the town by the linoleum manufacturer Sir Michael Nairn in 1929. It is adjacent to Ravenscraig Castle.

:Dunnikier Park, to the north of the town, purchased by the town council in 1945, consists of an area around Dunnikier House and is home to many woodland walkways. Dunnikier House was built around 1790 for James Townsend Oswald, M.P.

== Sport and leisure ==
 Raith Rovers F.C. is the town&#x27;s professional football team. They play in the Scottish Championship, the second tier of Scottish football, at their Stark&#x27;s Park ground. Founded in 1883, the club were elected to the Scottish Football League in 1902. They reached their highest league position in the 1921–22 season, when they were placed third in the Scottish Football League. They achieved a British scoring record of 142 goals in 34 matches in the 1937–38 season. Under manager Jimmy Nicholl, the team were promoted to the Scottish Premier Division as Division One champions in the 1994–95 season. In 1994 the club won their first national trophy, when they defeated Celtic 6–5 on penalties after finishing the game 2–2, to win the League Cup. This gained them qualification to the UEFA Cup in the following season, where they reached the second round before losing to Bayern Munich.

The other senior football team, Kirkcaldy &amp; Dysart, play at Denfield Park and compete in the , having moved from the Junior leagues in 2020. Kirkcaldy United were also a senior team based in the town, which dissolved in 1916.

Kirkcaldy RFC are the senior rugby team and play at Beveridge Park in Scottish National League Division Two, the third tier of Scottish club rugby. Fife Flyers, established in 1938, are the oldest ice hockey team in the United Kingdom. The team, who play at the Fife Ice Arena, have been members of the Elite League since the 2011–12 season. Dunnikier Cricket Club play at Dunnikier Park and a flag football club play at Beveridge Park. The town has a range of leisure facilities such as a swimming pool, an ice rink, and two golf courses (Kirkcaldy and Dunnikier). In August 2019, Kirkcaldy held its first half marathon in nearly thirty years.

Fife Steel Basketball Club are Kirkcaldy&#x27;s only BasketballScotland affiliated basketball club. Steel offer a number of age groups within the club and play in numerous National and Regional level competitions. Currently, the club are represented in both the Lothian Basketball League and Basketball Tayside and Fife League - both 3rd tier competitions.

A new £15 million leisure centre on the town&#x27;s Esplanade opened its doors in September 2013. This has replaced the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision to build a new leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners&#x27; right of access to the car park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.

Local running clubs include Kirkcaldy Wizards, which is both a JogScotland group and the Kirkcaldy area training group for Fife Athletic Club.

==Landmarks==

The oldest church in Kirkcaldy is the Old Kirk, the old parish church, on Kirk Wynd. The earliest mention of the Old Kirk is the record of its consecration in 1244 to St Brisse and St Patrick by David de Bernham, Bishop of St Andrews. The building&#x27;s deterioration in the late 18th century was addressed by major renovations to the main body of the church between 1807 and 1808. Only the square western tower, which dates from around 1500, was retained and is now the oldest building to have survived within the old burgh. In 2000 the Old Kirk was amalgamated with St Brycedale Church and was closed for public worship in 2008. It has since been re-opened by the Old Kirk Trust and is used for musical and dramatic performances. Other significant churches in the town include St Bryce Kirk built between 1877 and 1881 by James Matthews at the corner of St Brycedale Avenue and Kirk Wynd; Abbotshall Parish Church on Abbotshall Road, the current building completed in 1788 and Linktown Church built in 1830–1 by George Hay on Bethlefield Place.

Kirkcaldy Town House on Wemyssfield is the centrepiece of the town&#x27;s main civic square. The building was designed in the late 1930s by David Carr and William Howard of Edinburgh. With the advent of World War II, work was delayed on the building until 1950. Construction was split into two phases: the west wing, which was completed in 1953, and the east wing, completed in 1956.

Kirkcaldy War Memorial in War Memorial Gardens unveiled in 1925 was gifted to the town by John Nairn, linoleum manufacturer and grandson of Michael Nairn. This was dedicated to Ian Nairn, the son of John Nairn who died in the First World War. A Second World War memorial, designed by Thomas Hubbard, was later added and unveiled in 1958. The memorial commemorates the lives of 1,012 people from the First World War and 452 from the Second World War. Forming a centre piece to these gardens is Kirkcaldy Galleries, formerly known as Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery, which was also donated by Nairn.

In the north-east are two homes of early wealthy merchants and shipowners connected with Kirkcaldy&#x27;s harbour. The Merchant&#x27;s House or Law&#x27;s Close at 339–343 High Street; once owned by the Law family, is one of the best surviving examples of a 16th-century town house in Scotland. Sailors&#x27; Walk, at 443–449 High Street; consists of two 17th century houses, resting on foundations dating back to around 1460. These two houses were once divided into four dwellings; three of which were owned by the Oliphant family and the fourth by James Ferguson of Raith.

North of the harbour area, on The Path, are two examples of distinctive architectural styles. Hutchison&#x27;s House was designed by George Spears, the owner of the nearby East Bridge distillery, in 1793. Path House, originally known as Dunnikier House, is a three-storey L-plan tower house designed by John Watson in 1692 for his bride, Euphan Orrock. In 1703 Watson sold the house to the Oswald family, who had important links with the town. 

Two large stately homes also exist within the town. To the north of Kirkcaldy is Dunnikier House, built in the late 18th century as a seat for the Oswald family, replacing their previous residence at Path House. To the south-west of Kirkcaldy is Raith House, built in the late 17th century by Sir Alexander Raith, 4th Earl of Raith and Melville, for his wife, Barbara Dundas. The house remains a private residence of the Munro-Ferguson family.

To the east of the town are the ruins of Ravenscraig Castle on a rocky spit of land extending into the Firth of Forth. King James II began construction of the castle in 1460 for his queen, Mary of Guelders. It was also a means of defending the upper reaches of the Forth, including the port of Dysart. To a lesser extent it protected the harbour of Kirkcaldy against piracy and English rivalry. Ravenscraig is one of the earliest British castles designed to defend against and use artillery, an innovation demonstrated by the massive walls, the regularly placed shot holes, and the deep rock-cut ditch. Following the death of the King at the siege of Roxburgh Castle (1460), work continued on Ravenscraig, and it became a home for Mary of Gueldres until her death in 1463. In 1470 King James III granted the castle and lands to William Sinclair, Earl of Orkney and Caithness, in exchange for the castle in Kirkwall and the right to the Earldom of Orkney.

==Education==
The first school to be established in the town was Kirkcaldy Burgh School in 1582, a grammar school, with the local minister, Dr David Spens, as principal. Until premises were found, pupils were taught in the minister&#x27;s house. Notable pupils include Robert Adam and Adam Smith. The school was located at Hill Street before being rehoused in a new building on St Brycedale Avenue in 1843. A Government list of 1872 described the school as being of &#x27;higher class&#x27;. A new building for the school was given to the town in 1893 by Michael Barker Nairn, a linen manufacturer. Other schools were established in the town, including girls schools, subscription schools, and apprentice schools. The passing of the Education (Scotland) Act in 1872 replaced voluntary education in the town with a school-based education for all children aged 5 to 13.

Kirkcaldy has four secondary schools and eleven primary schools. Other educational facilities include a private school and a school for children with learning difficulties. Kirkcaldy High School, the oldest secondary school, serves pupils living in the north of the town and has occupied a site on Dunnikier Way since 1958. Balwearie High School opened as a junior secondary school in 1964 and was upgraded to a high school in 1972. The school serves pupils living in the western end of the town and neighbouring Kinghorn and Burntisland. Viewforth High School, which opened in 1908, was also initially a junior secondary school, but upgraded to a high school in 1980. Plans have been approved to build a new secondary school for Kirkcaldy East at the site of the Windmill Road Playing Fields. Work will be funded through the Building Fife&#x27;s School Project for completion in August 2016. St Andrews RC High School, which opened in the late 1950s is one of two Roman Catholic secondary schools in Fife. This caters to pupils living in the eastern half of Fife, from St Andrews to Burntisland and Lochgelly.
Further education is provided by Fife College who have their main campus on St Brycedale Avenue. The college was created in August 2013 from the merger of Adam Smith College, Fife and Carnegie College, Dunfermline. The University of Dundee also has a campus in the town which specialises as a School for Nursing and Midwifery. Originally built by the Fife Health Board for the use of the old Fife College of Further and Higher Education, this campus was taken over by the university in 1996.

==Public services==
Waste management is handled by the local authority, Fife Council. Kerbside recycling operates in the town. A four-bin collection is in place for the majority of residents. Kirkcaldy has one recycling centre and several recycling points, all operated by Fife Council. Non-hazardous waste is sent to landfill at Lochhead near Dunfermline, and Lower Melville Wood, near Ladybank.

Health care is supplied by NHS Fife, who have their main headquarters in the town at Hayfield House. The Victoria Hospital which is situated north of the town centre, is the town&#x27;s acute general and maternity hospital. A new £152.5 million extension to the hospital was completed in February 2012. This new wing contains a maternity unit, children&#x27;s department, 11 operating theatres and a new Accident and Emergency Department. Within the grounds of the hospital, a Maggie&#x27;s Centre, under the name of Maggie&#x27;s Fife, specialises in care for cancer patients. The centre, which was completed between 2004 and 2006, was the first building in the UK designed by Zaha Hadid, the Iraqi-born architect. Whyteman&#x27;s Brae Hospital, which is also part of the complex, serves psychiatric and elderly patients.

Statutory emergency fire and rescue services are provided by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. The main fire station in the town is on Dunnikier Road. Policing in Kirkcaldy is operated by

<text>Portadown ( ) is a town in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. The town is based on the River Bann in the north of the county, about southwest of Belfast. It is in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area and had a population of about 32,000 at the 2021 Census. For some purposes, Portadown is treated as part of the &quot;Craigavon Urban Area&quot;, alongside Craigavon and Lurgan.

Although Portadown was founded during the early 17th century English Plantation of Ulster, it was not until the Victorian era and the arrival of the railway that it developed as a major town. It earned the nickname &quot;hub of the North&quot; because it was a major railway junction; here the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s line diverged for Belfast, Dublin, Armagh and Derry. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Portadown was also a major centre for the production of textiles (mainly linen).

Portadown is the site of the long-running Drumcree dispute. Catholics have protested the yearly marches through their part of town by the Protestant Orange Order, who are celebrating the 1690 victory over Catholics by William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne. Often violence and protests have been sparked by this event. In the 1990s, the dispute escalated and the government responded with a massive security operation, drawing worldwide attention to Portadown.

==History==


===Early history and Plantation of Ulster===
The Portadown area had long been populated by Irish Gaels. 

At the beginning of the 1600s, this area was within the district of Clancann (&quot;Clann Chana&quot;), which was part of the larger territory of Oneilland (&quot;Uí Nialláin&quot;). This district was named after the dominant local clan—the McCanns (&quot;Mac Cana&quot;)—who had occupied the area since before the 13th century. The McCanns were then a vassal sept of the O&#x27;Neills (&quot;Uí Néill&quot;). On the eastern banks of the River Bann was the district of Clanbrasil (&quot;Clann Bhreasail&quot;).

The town&#x27;s name comes from the Irish &quot;Port a&#x27; Dúnáin&quot; (or, more formally, &quot;Port an Dúnáin&quot;), meaning the port or landing place of the small fort. This was likely a fort of the McCanns.

From 1594 until 1603, the O&#x27;Neills and an alliance of other clans fought in the Nine Years&#x27; War against the English Tudor conquest of Ireland. This ended in defeat for the Irish clans, and the Crown seized and redistributed much of their land. 

In 1608, King James VI and I began the Plantation of Ulster – the organised colonisation of the region by Protestant settlers from Britain, known as &#x27;planters&#x27;.

In 1610, as part of the Plantation, the lands of Portadown were granted to William Powell. In 1611, he sold his grant of land to Reverend Richard Rolleston, who in turn sold it in two portions to Richard Cope and Michael Obins. Obins built a large Elizabethan-style mansion for himself and his family, and a number of houses nearby for English tenants. This mansion was in the area of the present-day Woodside estate. 

The present-day People&#x27;s Park was part of its grounds. The park is now bounded on either side by Obins Street and Castle Street, both of which are references to &quot;Obins&#x27; Castle&quot;. In 1631, Obins was granted a licence for a &quot;fair and market&quot;. He built the first bridge across the River Bann shortly thereafter.

===Irish rebellion of 1641===
During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Obins Castle was captured by a force of dispossessed Irish led by the McCanns, Magennises and O&#x27;Neills. In November 1641, Irish rebels—likely under the command of Toole McCann—killed about 100 captured British settlers by forcing them off the Bann bridge and shooting those who swam ashore. 

This became known among British Protestants as the &quot;Portadown massacre&quot; and was one of the worst atrocities of the rebellion. It fuelled revenge killings by the English during the conflict that followed and was used to justify the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The Irish Confederate troops abandoned Obins Castle during the Cromwellian conquest. Hamlet Obins (who had survived its capture) repossessed it in 1652. It was later passed to his son, Anthony Obins.

===Industrialisation===
In 1741, Anthony Obins was involved with development of the Newry Canal. He was succeeded by Michael Obins in 1750. The latter set up a linen market in Portadown in 1762, which laid the foundations of Portadown&#x27;s major industry.

Michael Obins died in 1798 and left a son, Michael Eyre Obins, to succeed him. In 1814, Eyre Obins took holy orders; he sold the estate to the Sparrow family of Tandragee. 

George Montagu, 6th Duke of Manchester (known as Viscount Mandeville) married Millicent Sparrow in 1822 and came into possession of the estate. This family&#x27;s legacy in the town includes such street names as Montagu Street, Millicent Crescent and Mandeville Street, and buildings such as the Fergus Hall (formerly the Duke&#x27;s School and Church Street PS), and the Carleton Home. (Formerly the Duke&#x27;s townhouse, this was later used as a maternity hospital/nurses accommodation. It has since been adapted as private apartments).

The Blacker family, descended from Danes who had invaded and settled in Ireland in the 9th century, founded an estate at Carrick, on the Portadown–Gilford road. The land had been bought by Colonel Valentine Blacker from Sir Anthony Cope of Loughgall. It became known as Carrickblacker, and is now the site of Portadown Golf Club. One of the notables in the Blacker family, Colonel William Blacker, High Sheriff of Armagh, took part in the &quot;Battle of the Diamond&quot; and was a founding member of the Orange Order. 

This, and subsequent events such as the founding of a &#x27;provisional&#x27; Grand Lodge in the town after the &#x27;voluntary&#x27; dissolution of the Order in 1825, led to the town being known as &#x27;The Orange Citadel&#x27;. It was a center of sectarian strife for two centuries. Many of the Blacker family were soldiers or churchmen. The family estate was purchased in 1937 by Portadown Golf Club. In 1988 the club demolished Carrickblacker House to make way for a new clubhouse.

===World War II===

A large prisoner-of-war (POW) camp was built at Portadown during World War II. It was at the site of a former sports facility on what was then the western edge of town. This area is now covered by housing from Fitzroy Street and the Brownstown Estates. The camp housed (mostly) German POWs. For a time these POWs were guarded by Welsh servicemen (known as &quot;Bluecaps&quot;) who had been transferred from assignments with troops in Germany. They were billeted at St Patrick&#x27;s Hall in Thomas Street.

The local newspaper carried a story of another POW camp, adjacent to Killicomaine Castle (also known as Irwin&#x27;s Castle), in what was then known as &quot;Cullen&#x27;s Lane&quot; but is now called &quot;Princess Way&quot;. That area was later part of the Killicomaine estate, housing built in 1954 and largely contemporary with other estates built by the then Portadown Borough Council and the former Northern Ireland Housing Trust (now called the Northern Ireland Housing Executive).

A third camp was built on the Carrickblacker estate towards the end of World War II, possibly as an overflow for the nearby Elmfield Camp in Gilford. It was used as accommodation for Allied troops and no Axis POWs were ever imprisoned there.

In 2005, a public air-raid shelter was uncovered during excavation works near the riverbank just outside the town centre. One of ten built by the council during World War II, it is one of only two now remaining. The other is at the new roundabout on the Gilford Road. These are rare examples of public air raid shelters in Northern Ireland.

===The Troubles===

During the Troubles, there were numerous shootings, bombings and riots in Portadown. The conflict led to the deaths of 45 people in the town. 

Loyalists killed 25 people: eighteen Catholic civilians, three Protestant civilians, two members of the security forces, a republican paramilitary and a loyalist paramilitary. Irish republicans killed 18 people: nine members of the security forces, one loyalist paramilitary, seven Protestant civilians and one Catholic civilian. The security forces killed one Protestant civilian, and another loyalist was killed by his own bomb. In 1993 and 1998, the town centre was devastated by two large car bombs planted by republicans.

The Troubles resulted in the town becoming residentially segregated: the northwestern part of the town became almost wholly populated by the Catholic/Irish nationalist minority, while the rest of the town became almost wholly Protestant/unionist. Portadown&#x27;s &#x27;Catholic district&#x27; is now bordered by the railway line and by a security barrier (&quot;peace wall&quot;) along Corcrain Road.

The Troubles also intensified the long-running Drumcree marching dispute, over Orange marches through the Catholic part of town. Each July from 1995 to 2000, the dispute drew worldwide attention as it sparked protests and violence throughout Northern Ireland, prompted a massive police/British Army operation, and threatened to derail the peace process. When the Army sealed off the Catholic part of Portadown with large steel, concrete and barbed-wire barricades, the situation was reported by news media as like a &quot;war zone&quot; and a &quot;siege&quot;.

Each summer, during the &quot;marching season&quot;, there are many Protestant/loyalist marches in the town. Loyalists put up numerous flags and raise arches over some streets. These marches, and the raising of these flags and arches near the homes of Catholic families, continues to be a source of tension and sometimes a catalyst for violence.

Community leaders in Portadown have been involved with the Ulster Project since it began in 1975. The project involves teenagers from both of Northern Ireland&#x27;s main communities. The goal is to foster goodwill and friendship between them. Each year, a group of teenagers are chosen to travel to the United States, where they stay with an American family for a few weeks.

==Geography==
Portadown is located in a relatively flat part of Northern Ireland, near the southern shore of Lough Neagh. Two small wetland areas are on the outskirts of the town; one at Selshion in the west and another at Annagh in the south. The Ballybay River flows into the town from the west before joining the River Bann.

===River Bann===
Most of the town is built on the western side of the River Bann, which supported its industry and prosperity. Construction in 1740 of the Newry Canal (linking Carlingford Lough with Lough Neagh) enabled Portadown to become a hub for the water traffic between Newry and Belfast.

There are three bridges across the river at Portadown. Bridge Street and Northway are both road bridges, and there is a railway bridge beside the Northway. The &#x27;Bann Bridge&#x27; on Bridge Street is the oldest. It was unusual in that it was built over dry earth. After the bridge was completed, the course of the River Bann was diverted by some 100 yards to straighten a meander and run under the bridge. The old riverbed was then built upon. 

In the 21st century, an archaeological dig in the area of the old riverbed uncovered the bones of some of those who were drowned in the 1641 massacre in the town.

===Townlands===
Like the rest of Ireland, the Portadown area has long been divided into townlands, whose names came mostly from the Irish language. Portadown sprang up along a road (High Street/Market Street) that marked the boundary between two of these – Tavanagh and Corcrain. Over time, the surrounding townlands have been built upon and they have given their names to many roads and housing estates. 

The following is a list of townlands within Portadown&#x27;s urban area, alongside their likely etymologies:

West bank of the River Bann (parish of Drumcree):
*Annagh ()
*Ballyoran (from &quot;Baile Uaráin&quot; meaning &quot;townland of the spring&quot;)
*Baltylum (from &quot;Bailte Loma&quot; meaning &quot;bare townlands&quot;)
*Clounagh or Clownagh (from &quot;Cluaineach &quot; meaning &quot;place of the water-meadow&quot;)
*Corcrain (from &quot;Corr Chrainn&quot; meaning &quot;round hill of the tree&quot;)
*Garvaghy (from &quot;Garbh Achadh&quot; meaning &quot;rough field&quot;)

*Selshion (from &quot;Soilseán&quot; meaning &quot;shining place&quot;)
*Tavanagh (from &quot;Tamhnach&quot; meaning &quot;grassland&quot;)

East bank of the River Bann (parish of Seagoe):
*Ballyhannon (from &quot;Baile Uí Sheanacháin&quot; meaning &quot;O&#x27;Shannon&#x27;s townland&quot;)
*Bocombra (formerly &quot;Bocomra&quot;, from &quot;Bac Iomarach&quot; meaning &quot;ridged bank&quot;)
*Edenderry (from &quot;Éadan Doire&quot; meaning &quot;hill-brow of the oak grove&quot;)
*Kernan (formerly &quot;Kerhanan&quot;, from &quot;Caorthannán&quot; meaning &quot;place of rowans&quot;)
*Killycomain or Killicomain (from &quot;Coill Uí Chomáin&quot; meaning &quot;Ó Comáin&#x27;s woodland&quot;)
*Levaghery (from &quot;Leathmhachaire&quot; meaning &quot;half plain&quot;)
*Lisnisky (from &quot;Lios an Uisce&quot; meaning &quot;ringfort of the water&quot;) – the fields in Lisnisky separate Portadown from Craigavon
*Seagoe Upper (from &quot;Suidhe Gobha&quot; meaning &quot;seat of Gobhan&quot;)

===Climate===
The climate of Portadown is like that of much of the rest of the UK and Ireland, being a temperate oceanic climate. It has mild temperatures throughout the year. historically summer temperatures have not reached levels to be deemed very hot and winter not very cold, but climate change has resulted in more extreme temperatures in the 21st century. 

Summer temperatures can reach more than though it is rare for them to go higher than . The consistently humid climate that prevails over Ireland can make these temperatures feel uncomfortable when they stray into the high 20s °C (80–85 °F), more so than similar temperatures in hotter but drier climates in the rest of Europe. It also receives a steady amount of rainfall throughout the year.

==Demography==
For census purposes, Portadown is not treated as a separate entity by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Instead, it is combined with Craigavon, Lurgan and Bleary to form the &quot;Craigavon Urban Area&quot;. However, a fairly accurate population count can be arrived at by combining the data of the electoral wards that make up Portadown. These wards are Annagh, Ballybay, Ballyoran, Brownstown, Corcrain, Edenderry, Killycomain and Tavanagh.

On the day of the last census (21 March 2021), the combined population of these wards was 32,926. 
Of this population:
*17,063 (51.8%) were Protestant or from a Protestant background
*12,205 (37.0%) were Catholic or from a Catholic background
*3,658 (11.2%) were of other religious backgrounds or no religious background.

On the day of the census (21 March 2011) the combined population of these wards was 22,899. 
Of this population:
*13,957 (60.9%) were Protestant or from a Protestant background
*7,300 (31.8%) were Catholic or from a Catholic background
*1,642 (7.3%) were of other religious backgrounds or no religious background.

Immigrants make up about 8% of the town&#x27;s population, many of whom come from Eastern Europe, and [[Portugal. Some have also come from [[East Timor]], [[China]], and [[India]].

On the day of the [[United Kingdom Census 2021|last census (21 March 2021)]], the combined ethnic groups of these wards are: 

*30,799 (93.5%) were White (including White British, White Irish and other white groups)
*1,025 (3.11%) were Black or British Black
*560 (1.7%) were Asian or British Asian (including South Asian, East Asian and Filippino)
*542 (1.6%) were other ethnic group (included mixed).

==Governance==

Portadown is part of the Upper Bann constituency for elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The boundaries of the [[Upper Bann (Assembly constituency)|Assembly constituency]] and [[Upper Bann (UK Parliament constituency)|Parliament constituency]] are identical. This has long been a safe [[Ulster unionism|unionist]] seat.

Portadown came under the governance of Portadown Borough Council following the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]]. This was abolished with the [[Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971]] and the [[Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972]]. Henceforth, the town had been under the jurisdiction of the larger [[Craigavon Borough Council]]. 

However, after [[Reform of local government in Northern Ireland|local government reform]], the town is now part of one of Northern Ireland&#x27;s largest councils, the [[Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council|Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council]]. Councillors are elected to the council every four years by [[proportional representation]].

The councillors for the DEA are:

==Religious sites==
Portadown is located along the River Bann, which forms the boundary between two parishes. The part of the town to the west of the Bann is in Drumcree parish, while the part of the town on the east of the Bann is in Seagoe parish.

===Protestant churches===
In 1826, Saint Martin&#x27;s [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglican) was built, and later renamed Saint Mark&#x27;s. Before this, Church of Ireland members attended either [[Drumcree Church|Drumcree Parish Church]] or [[Seagoe Parish Church]].

The current Seagoe Parish Church of [[St. Gobhan]]&#x27;s (Church of Ireland), was built in 1814. It replaced the many previous church foundations, dating from circa 7th century, that were located about one hundred yards distant. The ancient cemetery of Seagoe is adjacent to this site. The church is linked to Seagoe Primary School, which is maintained by the Church. It is one of the few remaining Anglican primary schools. The former [[Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church]], Most Revd [[David Chillingworth]] was rector at Seagoe for 19 years. St Columba&#x27;s Parish on the Loughhall Road, and Knocknamuckley Church of Ireland (St. Matthias) on the Bleary Road are also extant parishes.

There are two [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Presbyterian]] churches, First Portadown (aka Edenderry) Presbyterian Church (1822) and Armagh Road Presbyterian Church (1859). The Rev Stafford Carson was Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, June 2009 to June 2010.

The Methodist church has operated at several different sites. It now stands in Thomas Street.

In addition, there are [[Baptist]] meeting halls on Thomas Street and Killicomaine Road; an [[Elim Pentecostal Church|Elim]] Pentecostal church on Clonavon Avenue; a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] meeting hall on Portmore Street; and a large [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster|Free Presbyterian]] congregation meets in Levaghery. The [[pentecostal]] Light of the World Ministries are located in the town, as are the [[evangelical]] [[neocharismatic]] [[Association of Vineyard Churches|Vineyard]] Church. The [[Salvation Army]] have a hall in Edward Street.

===Catholic churches===
Saint John the Baptist&#x27;s Church was built in the townland of Ballyoran in 1783. The original church had become surrounded by a large graveyard. A second Catholic church, Saint Patrick&#x27;s, was built on William Street in 1835.

In the 1980s Saint John&#x27;s was taken down brick-by-brick, moved and rebuilt at the [[Ulster Folk and Transport Museum]] in [[Cultra]], [[County Down]]. A new Saint John&#x27;s church was built in 1977 close to where the original stood. It is at the intersection of the Garvaghy Road and the Dungannon Road.

===Other churches===
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a church on the Brownstown Road. In addition the [[Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses]] have a [[Kingdom Hall]], on the town outskirts in Kernan.

==Transport==

A combination of road, canal and rail links, all converging on [[Portadown railway station]], gave it the nickname &quot;Hub of the North&quot;. This supported employment through mass industry and marketing and shipping of agricultural products from the area. The Newry Canal, opened in 1742, linked [[Carlingford Lough]] and the [[Irish Sea]] with Lough Neagh. It joined the River Bann a couple of miles to the southeast of Portadown. The canal opened up waterborne trade and left Portadown ideally situated to take full advantage of the trading routes. However, the canal went into decline with the growth of the railway network and it closed to commercial traffic in 1936.

About a century later, establishment of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] resulted in extending overland trading routes and shortening delivery times shortened. The town&#x27;s first railway station opened in 1842.

At Portadown railway station, lines were built serving destinations in four diretions: one went northeast toward Belfast, one northwest toward [[Dungannon]], one southwest to [[Armagh]], and one southeast toward [[Newry]] and onward to [[Dublin]]. Today only the [[Dublin–Belfast railway line|Belfast–Dublin line]] remains. Repair yards were opened in 1925 and these large concrete buildings dominated the skyline on the west of the town centre. The current station opened in 1970.

[[National Cycle Route 9]] links Portadown with [[Belfast]] and [[Newry]].

==Economy==
Portadown&#x27;s major employers have included:
*[[Irwin&#x27;s Bakery]] was established in 1912 as a grocery retailer by William David Irwin, grandfather of the existing joint managing directors. It expanded into Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland in the 1980s.
* Wade (Ireland) Ltd. Wade Ceramics had a substantial plant in Portadown between in Watson Street, Edenderry, adjacent to the Victorian Railway Station. The factory closed in 2002.
* Ulster Carpets Ltd was established in the town in 1938 and was the major employer producing woolen [[Axminster]]. 
*Henry Denny &amp; Sons (NI) Ltd. meat processors were originally established in Obins Street. It moved to Corcrain after being acquired in 1982 by the Kerry Group.

===Linen manufacturing===
Much of the town&#x27;s industry in the 19th and 20th centuries was centred on the linen trade. The 1881 edition of &quot;Slater&#x27;s Directory&quot; (a comprehensive listing of Irish towns) listed 15 manufacturing employers in Portadown at that time.

==Landmarks==

[[Portadown Town Hall]], in Edward Street, was once the seat of the town&#x27;s local government. Reforme of local government in 1972 resulted in a change in venue. The Town Hall, an 1890 Victorian building, has been extensively refurbished to offer a commercial in-house theatre and conference facilities.

The Millennium Court Arts Centre contains two galleries featuring exhibits by local artists.

Ardress House is a 17th-century farmhouse that was remodelled in Georgian times. Today it is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. It is open to the public and offers guided tours, local walks, and recreations of farmyard life.

The Newry Canal Way is a fully accessible, restored canal towpath now usable as a bicycle route between [[Newry Town Hall]] and the Bann Bridge in Portadown. The Canal was the first summit-level canal in Britain and Ireland and has 14 locks between its entrance at Carlingford Lough and the other end at Lough Neagh.

One of the attractions on the Newry Canal Way is Moneypenny&#x27;s Lock, a site that includes an 18th-century lock-keeper&#x27;s house, stables and [[bothy]]. This provided accommodation for workers on the canal and their horses in the days when the canal was part of the industrial transport network. Today it is administered jointly by the Museum Services and the Lough Neagh Discovery Centre at Oxford Island.

The only fully restored [[Royal Observer Corps]] [[Cold War]] Nuclear Monitoring Bunker in Northern Ireland is located just outside the town off Dungannon Road. Opened in 1958 it, and an additional 57 other bunkers spread throughout Northern Ireland, would have been used to monitor and report the effects of a Nuclear Attack. The bunker was closed and abandoned in 1991. Nearly 20 years later, it was fully restored to its 1980s appearance and opened as a museum in 2010.

==Education==

Portadown has (or had) a large selection of academic institutions, past and present. Today, schools in Portadown operate under the [[Dickson Plan]], a transfer system in north Armagh that allows pupils at age 11 the option of taking the [[11-plus]] exam to enter [[grammar schools]]. Pupils in comprehensive junior high schools are sorted into grammar and non-grammar streams. Pupils can get promoted to or demoted from the grammar stream during their time in those schools, depending on the development of their academic performance. At age 14 they can take subject-based exams across the syllabus to qualify for entry into a dedicated grammar school to pursue [[GCSE]]s and [[A-levels]].

===Primary education===
The state-run Thomas Street Primary School, and Church Street Primary School, formerly the &quot;Duke&#x27;s School&quot;, were both incorporated into Millington Primary School in 1970. Other state-run primary schools include [[Ballyoran Primary School]], Bocombra Primary School, Edenderry Primary School, Hart Memorial Primary School, Moyallan Primary School, Portadown Primary School, Richmount Primary School, and the [[Church of Ireland|Anglican]] [[Seagoe Parish Church#Seagoe Primary School|Seagoe Primary School]]. Derrycarne Primary School is now used as an Orange Hall by the Orange Order.

Primary schools managed by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools are Presentation Convent Primary School, St John the Baptist Primary School ([[Irish Language|Irish:]] &quot;Bunscoil Eoin Baiste&quot;), which has both English-medium and Irish-medium units within it, and St. John&#x27;s Primary School. St Columba&#x27;s Primary School in Carleton Street is now closed. 

A multi-denominational, integrated primary school, known as Portadown Integrated Primary School, opened in 1990.

==Healthcare==

Access to a GP is provided at Portadown Health Centre. Hospital care and Accident and Emergency services are available at [[Craigavon Area Hospital]], built 1972 on the outskirts of town as part of the Craigavon development.

==Sport==

Association football is played by [[Portadown F.C.]] and [[Annagh United]] in the [[NIFL Championship]], and [[Bourneview Young Men F.C.]], [[Hanover F.C.]], [[St Mary&#x27;s Youth F.C.]] and [[Seagoe F.C.]] in the [[Mid-Ulster Football League]]. 

Rugby is played by [[Portadown RFC|Portadown Rugby Club]], and [[Gaelic football]] is played by Tír na nÓg GAA Club.

==Media==
Portadown&#x27;s main local newspaper is the &quot;[[Portadown Times]]&quot;, which is published by [[Johnston Publishing (NI)]]. Although the newspaper focuses on the Portadown area, it also serves towns and villages across [[County Armagh|north Armagh]]. It was founded in 1924 and is issued weekly.

Between 2001 and 2005, Portadown resident [[Newton Emerson]] ran a controversial [[satire|satirical]] online newspaper called the &quot;[[Portadown News]]&quot;. The website, which was updated biweekly, attracted media attention by poking fun at Northern Ireland politics and culture.

<text>Craigavon ( ) is a town in north County Armagh, Northern Ireland. It was a planned settlement, begun in 1965, and named after the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland: James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon. It was intended to be the heart of a new linear city incorporating Lurgan and Portadown, but this plan was mostly abandoned and later described as having been flawed. Locally, &quot;Craigavon&quot; refers to the urban area between the two towns. It is built beside a pair of artificial lakes and is made up of a large residential area (Brownlow), a second smaller one (Mandeville), plus a central area (Highfield) that includes a substantial shopping centre, a courthouse and the district council headquarters. The area around the lakes is a public park and wildlife haven made up of woodland with walking trails. There is also a watersports centre, golf course and ski slope in the area. In most of Craigavon, motor vehicles are completely separated from pedestrians, and roundabouts are used extensively. It hosted the headquarters of the former Craigavon Borough Council.

Craigavon sometimes refers to the much larger Craigavon Urban Area, a name used by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, which includes Craigavon, Lurgan, Portadown and Aghacommon.

==History==
===Original plans===

Craigavon was planned as a &#x27;new city&#x27; for Northern Ireland that would mirror towns such as Cumbernauld and, later, Milton Keynes in Great Britain. It was conceived as a linear city that would link the towns of Lurgan and Portadown to create a single urban area and identity. The argument for a new town was based on projections indicating population increases over the following decades that would require large-scale house building. Similar projects successfully attracting economic growth had been successfully completed in Great Britain, so it was in some ways a symbol of Northern Ireland as both modern and a part of the British mainstream. The Craigavon Development Commission was appointed in October 1965 to develop the &#x27;new city&#x27;. About 6,000 acres of land between Lurgan and Portadown was vested from farmers at £6 an acre. Several reasons have been suggested for the suitability of the site including the existing population centres, industrial base, nearness to Belfast and the belief that Craigavon would help spread development away from Belfast. It was hoped that residents of Belfast would be attracted by the suburban nature of Craigavon&#x27;s design and that business would see it as an interesting alternative. Cash incentives were offered to some families moving to Craigavon. The M1 motorway was built to link the new city with Belfast and there were plans to replace the Lurgan and Portadown railway stations with a single high speed terminal in central Craigavon. The Craigavon Area Hospital was built to replace small hospitals in the two towns.

The design of Craigavon was based on Modernism and imbued with the spirit of the age. The planners separated motor vehicles from pedestrians and cyclists wherever possible, creating a network of paths allowing residents to travel across Craigavon without encountering traffic. The road network for motor vehicles used roundabouts instead of traffic lights at junctions, giving the planners the ability to easily increase the number of lanes if it became necessary. Electricity and other cables were placed underground and street lighting was standard throughout. The planners clustered the housing developments around small &#x27;village centres&#x27; with associated retail space, leisure facilities, post offices, primary schools, pharmacies, community centres and other civic amenities. All estates were built with security in mind, with one vehicle entry/exit point. Single-use zoning was part of the design; there was a total separation of industrial land-use from all other uses.

Craigavon was designed to be a very child-friendly environment with small playgrounds dotted throughout the residential areas. There was an emphasis on providing green space in the housing estates and safe paths to cycle on. National Cycle Route 9 passes through the town. The new town was also provided with many civic amenities including a leisure centre, library, shopping centre, civic centre, a large park with artificial lakes, playing fields, a petting zoo, public gardens and an artificial ski slope. Craigavon Civic Centre was built at a cost of £3 million and was officially opened by the Duke of Abercorn in April 1983.

===Difficulties===
There was controversy over the decision to build a &#x27;new city&#x27; in the mainly Protestant/unionist east rather than to develop the mainly Catholic city of Derry. There was also controversy over the decision to name it after The 1st Viscount Craigavon (1871–1940), a Protestant unionist leader. Some unionists also felt the decision was unwise and counterproductive to building cross-community relations. Knockmena (a corruption of the townland name, Knockmenagh) was the preferred name nationalists hoped would be used, and which might have attracted broad acceptance on both sides. On 6 July 1965, it was announced that the new city would be named Craigavon after Craig. A noted nationalist, Joseph Connellan, interrupted the announcement with the comment, &quot;A Protestant city for a Protestant people&quot;. Irish Labour MP Gerry Fitt described the naming of the new city as &quot;a calculated insult&quot; and Nationalist MP for East Tyrone Austin Currie said &quot;To call this new city after someone who is looked upon by over one-third of the population as an arch-bigot is something that ought to be abhorred.&quot;

Problems began to come to light when it emerged that some housing estates had been built with materials and techniques that had not been fully tested, with the result that insulation, sound-proofing and durability were lacking. This was compounded by the outbreak of &#x27;the Troubles&#x27; in the late 1960s, which resulted in sectarian violence and segregation. Investment into Northern Ireland dried up and emigration rose. The Craigavon Development Commission was wound up in 1973 and Craigavon Borough Council created. The area&#x27;s main employer, Goodyear, had a large fan-belt factory in the Silverwood industrial estate, and at the time it was Europe&#x27;s largest factory. However, the plant failed to make money on a consistent basis, and had to shut in 1983.

Consequently, about half of what was planned was never built, and of what was built, some had to be demolished after becoming empty and derelict. The area designated as Craigavon &#x27;city centre&#x27;, for much of this time contained only the municipal authority, the court buildings and a shopping mall, surrounded by greenfield land. Dr Stephen McKay, director of education at the School of Planning, Architecture &amp; Civil Engineering at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, said that the plan to build Craigavon was &quot;flawed from the outset&quot;, adding: &quot;The cycle ways, mixed housing and recreational zones were really never going to work in light of the circumstances&quot;. Locally-born writer Newton Emerson said: &quot;As a child, I didn&#x27;t notice the failure of Craigavon. The new city was an enormous playground of hidden cycle paths, roads that ended suddenly in the middle of nowhere and futuristic buildings standing empty in an artificial landscape&quot;. Craigavon became notorious for its many roundabouts.

The identity of a new city never really caught on. The name &#x27;Craigavon&#x27; is today used by locals to refer to the area between Lurgan and Portadown, and many citizens of those towns resent being identified with the &#x27;new city&#x27; of Craigavon. The intention to integrate the new city also largely failed, with those who were encouraged to move from other parts of Northern Ireland generally choosing where to live based on proximity to each respective town, i.e., Catholics/nationalists moved to estates close to Lurgan, whereas Protestants/unionists gravitated towards the Portadown area. A certain degree of integration that existed when Craigavon was first built in the 1960s crumbled in the 1970s against a backdrop of escalating violence; in one week in 1972, as a result of Loyalist intimidation, fifty families fled the Killicomaine estate: half the Catholic population in the area. By the end of the year, another twenty had gone. Protestants were also targeted and five narrowly escaped being burnt to death in their fish and chip shop in Churchill Park in February 1973.

===The Troubles===
There were many violent incidents in Craigavon related to the Troubles, in which a number of people were killed.

On 11 November 1982, three Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) members—Eugene Toman (21), Sean Burns (21) and Gervaise McKerr (31)—were shot dead by undercover Royal Ulster Constabulary officers at a vehicle checkpoint on Tullygally East Road. They were unarmed, leading to claims of a shoot-to-kill policy by security forces. The RUC denied this, saying the men had driven through the checkpoint.

The Craigavon mobile shop killings took place on 28 March 1991, when the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) shot dead three Catholic civilians in the Drumbeg estate. A gunman shot the two teenage girls working in the mobile shop: Eileen Duffy (19) and Katrina Rennie (16). He then forced a male customer, Brian Frizzell (29), to lie on the pavement and shot him also. There are allegations of collusion between the UVF and police.

On 14 November 1991 the UVF shot dead three more civilians on Carbet Road as they were driving home from work at the Hyster forklift factory: Desmond Rogers (54), Fergus Magee (28), and John Lavery (27).

The Continuity IRA shot dead PSNI officer Stephen Carroll in Craigavon on 10 March 2009, the first police fatality in Northern Ireland since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.

==Geography==
Craigavon lies on an area of flat land near the southeastern shore of Lough Neagh. The surrounding settlements (listed clockwise) are Aghacommon (north), Lurgan (northeast), Corcreeny (east), Bleary (southeast) and Portadown (southwest). It is separated from these surrounding settlements mostly by fields.

Craigavon is built beside two artificial lakes called Craigavon Lakes. The Portadown–Lurgan railway line runs between the two lakes, and further north is the M1 motorway, which runs parallel with the railway line. The area around Craigavon Lakes is a public park and wildlife haven made up of woodland with walking trails. In 2017 it was awarded the best park in Northern Ireland by Fields in Trust. Recent plans to build in the park, beginning with a college campus, have met opposition from some locals.

===Townlands===
Much of Craigavon is within the civil parish of Seagoe. The following is a list of townlands within Craigavon&#x27;s urban area (excluding Lurgan, Portadown and Bleary), along with their likely etymologies:
* Balteagh ()
* Clanrolla (from &quot;Cluain Drola&quot; meaning &quot;meadow of the shaft&quot;)
* Crossmacahilly (from &quot;Cros Mhic Eachmhilidh&quot; meaning &quot;McAughley&#x27;s crossroads&quot;)
* Drumgask (from &quot;Druim gCásca&quot; meaning &quot;Easter ridge&quot;)
* Drumgor (from &quot;Druim gCorr&quot; meaning &quot;ridge of the herons&quot;)
* Drumnagoon (from &quot;Dromainn Uí Dhubháin&quot; meaning &quot;O&#x27;Doone&#x27;s ridge&quot;)
* Knockmenagh (from &quot;An Cnoc Meánach&quot; meaning &quot;the middle hill&quot;)
* Legaghory or Legahory (from &quot;Log a&#x27; Choire&quot; meaning &quot;hollow of the cauldron&quot;)
* Monbrief (historically also Moybreefe, perhaps from &quot;Má Bhreagh&quot; meaning &quot;plain of the rising ground&quot; or &quot;Má Bhréach&quot;, &quot;plain of wolves&quot;)
* Moyraverty or Moyraferty (from &quot;Maigh Raifeartaigh&quot; meaning &quot;Raifeartach&#x27;s plain&quot;)
* Tamnafiglassan (from &quot;Tamhnach an Ghlasáin&quot; meaning &quot;grassy field of the finch&quot;)
* Tannaghmore West (from &quot;Tamhnach Mór&quot; meaning &quot;big grassy field&quot;)
* Tullygally (from &quot;Tulaigh Geala&quot; meaning &quot;white hills&quot;)

==Demography==
For census purposes, Craigavon is not treated as a separate entity by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Instead, it is combined with Portadown, Lurgan and Bleary to form the &quot;Craigavon Urban Area&quot;. This makes it difficult to glean an accurate demographic picture of the area that is generally regarded as Craigavon – the mainly residential area between Portadown and Lurgan. This area roughly corresponds with the Drumgask, Drumgor, Kernan and (part of) Taghnevan electoral wards. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, Craigavon hosted many families of Refugees of the Vietnam War.

===2021 census===
On census day 2021 (21 March 2021), the usually resident population of Craigavon Urban Area including Aghacommon was 72,301. Of these:

*St Anthony&#x27;s Primary School (Catholic Maintained)
*St Brendan&#x27;s Primary School (Catholic Maintained)
* Tullygally Primary School (Controlled) - a mixed religion school. It has about 100 pupils at any one time. It was built by the government with the original founding of Craigavon and was part of the library board.

There are many more primary and secondary schools in the wider Craigavon areas of Lurgan, Portadown, etc.

There are also plans to build a Southern Regional College campus beside Craigavon Lake. The plans have met opposition from some locals, as it would involve the destruction of woodland which is home to endangered wildlife.

<doc id="355088" wikidata="Q1070149" url="?curid=355088" title="Against (album)">
<text>Against is the seventh studio album by the Brazilian metal band Sepultura, released in 1998 through Roadrunner Records. It is the band&#x27;s first release with new frontman Derrick Green, who replaced group founder Max Cavalera in 1997.

==Album information==
Like &quot;Roots&quot; that preceded it, the album has a variety of guest musicians and incorporates tribal influences – Japanese percussion elements are added with the assistance of Japanese taiko group Kodo.

The songs &quot;Against&quot;, &quot;Choke&quot; and &quot;Tribus&quot; were released as singles, with a music video accompanying &quot;Choke&quot;. The video featured footage from the &quot;Barulho Contra Fome&quot; (&quot;Noise Against Hunger&quot;) concert that was the first gig of the &quot;Against&quot; tour. This performance included guest appearances from the Xavante tribe, who had featured on &quot;Roots&quot; (as documented in the &quot;Choke&quot; video) as well as Mike Patton, Jason Newsted, Carlinhos Brown, original Sepultura guitarist Jairo Guedz and Coffin Joe (whose &quot;blessing&quot; of the band performed during this concert turned up as a B-side entitled &quot;Prenúncio&quot; on the &quot;Tribus&quot; EP).

The flute section of &quot;Kamaitachi&quot; performed by Kodo is heavily based on that in &quot;The Hunted&quot; which appeared on Kodo&#x27;s &quot;Ibuki&quot; album and was originally composed for the soundtrack of the movie of the same name. The song &quot;The Waste&quot; (a vocal version of &quot;Kamaitachi&quot; featuring Mike Patton on vocals which appeared on the single B-sides) is featured in the movie &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; and its soundtrack.

==Release==
&quot;Against&quot; was a commercial disappointment compared to &quot;Roots&quot;, selling only 18,000 copies its first week in the US, and peaking at 82 on the Billboard 200. It also underperformed elsewhere, such as in Germany and the Netherlands. It has sold over 130,000 copies in the United States. To support the album, The band toured with Metallica in the latter&#x27;s May 1999 tour in Brazil, and opened for Slayer in an American tour.
==Reception==
&quot;Against&quot; has received mixed-to-positive reviews since it was released. AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and said that &quot;there are enough flashes of the old Sepultura brilliance to suggest that great things are still to come&quot;. The album received a very positive response from Chronicles of Chaos, who said, &quot;The new LP focuses on and showcases the real power of Sepultura, managing to reinvent themselves once again with this LP, but still stay so close to Sepultura&#x27;s trademark sound.&quot;
===Legacy===
Songs like &quot;Choke&quot;, &quot;Boycott&quot; and the title track were still being played live during &quot;Machine Messiah&quot; era (2017–2018).

In 2019, many years after the album release, singer Derrick Green stated &quot;I feel so proud and happy about it, because it has affected so many people that I didn&#x27;t realise (back then). At the time when we were playing the shows, people had just gotten into the changes of the band, but so many people have great stories from their first time hearing this album. So I really feel it now when we play these songs, how excited people get, you know? It&#x27;s great to see that the evolution of people having time to &#x27;ingest&#x27; all the changes and everything. It&#x27;s such an important album for keeping the band together.

<text>Earl&#x27;s Court is a district of Kensington in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in West London, bordering the rail tracks of the West London line and District line that separate it from the ancient borough of Fulham to the west, the sub-districts of South Kensington to the east, Chelsea to the south and Kensington to the northeast. It lent its name to the now defunct eponymous pleasure grounds opened in 1887 followed by the pre–World War II Earls Court Exhibition Centre, as one of the country&#x27;s largest indoor arenas and a popular concert venue, until its closure in 2014.

In practice, the notion of Earl&#x27;s Court, which is geographically confined to the SW5 postal district, tends to apply beyond its boundary to parts of the neighbouring Fulham area with its SW6 and W14 postcodes to the west, and to adjacent streets in postcodes SW7, SW10 and W8 in Kensington and Chelsea.

Earl&#x27;s Court is also an electoral ward of the local authority, Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council. Its population at the 2011 census was 9,104.

==History==

===Early history===
Earl&#x27;s Court was once a rural area, covered in orchards, green fields and market gardens. The Saxon Thegn Edwin held the lordship of the area prior to the Norman conquest. Subsequently, the land, part of the ancient manor of Kensington, was under the lordship of the de Vere family, the Earls of Oxford, descendants of Aubrey de Vere I, who held the manor of Geoffrey de Montbray, bishop of Coutances, according to the Domesday Book 1086. By &quot;circa&quot; 1095, his tenure had been converted, and he held Kensington directly from the crown. A church had been constructed there by 1104.

For centuries, Earl&#x27;s Court remained associated with the De Vere family, who likely lent their comital title to the manor house that became known as the &quot;Earl&#x27;s Court&quot;. Ownership later transferred through marriage in the early 17th century to the family of Sir William Cope. His daughter Isabella married Henry Rich, an ambitious courtier who was created 1st Earl of Holland in 1624. The manor subsequently passed to Rich and the house later constructed at Holland Park would bear his name for posterity as Holland House. Eventually, the estate was divided into two parts. The part now known as Holland Park was sold to Henry Fox in 1762. The Earl&#x27;s Court portion was retained and descended to William Edwardes, 1st Baron Kensington.

The original manor house was located on the site of the present-day Earl&#x27;s Court, where the Old Manor Yard is now, just by Earl&#x27;s Court tube station, eastern entrance. Earl&#x27;s Court Farm is visible on Greenwood&#x27;s map of London dated 1827.

In the late 18th century, the area began to transition from rural estates to suburban housing developments. The surgeon John Hunter had established a home and animal menagerie on the site of the former manor house in 1765. After his death in 1793, the property changed hands several times. For a period in the early 19th century it operated as a lodging house and asylum before being demolished in 1886.

===19th century===
At the beginning of the century, the estate was generating modest rents from farmland and some building leases.
There were unsuccessful speculative attempts at development in the 1820s, including failed housing development ventures. A two-mile conversion of the insanitary Counter&#x27;s Creek into the Kensington Canal (1826 onwards) didn&#x27;t attract substantial traffic and was followed by its eventual replacement by &quot;Mr Punch&#x27;s railway&quot;, which ceased operations six months after opening. Building resumed slowly in the 1840s. By 1852 when Lord Kensington died, development was still confined to the northern part of the estate above Pembroke Road.

Meanwhile, the congestion apparent in London and Middlesex for burials at the start of the century was causing public concern not least on health grounds. Brompton Cemetery was duly established by Act of Parliament, laid out in 1839 and opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. It was consecrated by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London, in June 1840, and is now one of Britain&#x27;s oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries, served by the adjacent West Brompton station.
The construction of the Metropolitan District Railway in 1865–69, which eventually became London Underground&#x27;s District Line and was joined after 1907 by the Piccadilly line in the 1860s, enabled the transformation of Earl&#x27;s Court from farmland into a Victorian suburb. In the quarter century after 1867, Earl&#x27;s Court was transformed into a loosely populated Middlesex suburb and in the 1890s a more dense parish with 1,200 houses and two churches.

Eardley Crescent and Kempsford Gardens were built between 1867 and 1873, building began in Earl&#x27;s Court Square and Longridge Road in 1873, in Nevern Place in 1874, in Trebovir Road and Philbeach Gardens in 1876 and Nevern Square in 1880. Gunter estate was developed East of Earl&#x27;s Court road between 1865 and 1896. 

Earl&#x27;s Court&#x27;s only hospital was opened in 1887 on the corner of Old Brompton Road and Finborough Road. It was named Princess Beatrice Hospital in honour of Queen Victoria&#x27;s youngest daughter. The hospital closed in 1978.

===20th century===


For most of the century, Earl&#x27;s Court was home to three notable institutions, all now gone. The first and indeed oldest school of its kind is the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art founded in 1861. It was located on the corner of Cromwell Road and Earl&#x27;s Court Road, until its move to the former Royal Ballet School in Talgarth Road. The next foundation dated 1892, was the London Electronics College (formerly the London School of Telegraphy), which was located at 20 Penywern Road and in its heyday did much to expand the use of Morse code throughout the world. Already in the 1990s it was threatened with closure as technology had moved on. It finally closed in 2017 having served as a further education college offering electronic engineering and IT courses. The third institution was the Poetry Society, founded in 1909 and housed at 21 Earl&#x27;s Court Square. It decamped to new premises in the recently refurbished Covent Garden district of Central London in the 1990s.

Evidently, after WWI, Earl&#x27;s Court had already acquired a slightly louche reputation if George Bernard Shaw is to be believed, see his &quot;Pygmalion&quot;. 
Following the Second World War a number of Polish officers, part of the Polish Resettlement Corps, who had fought alongside Allied Forces, but were unable to return to their homeland under Soviet dominance (see Yalta Conference), opened small businesses and settled in the Earl&#x27;s Court area leading to Earl&#x27;s Court Road being dubbed the &quot;Polish Corridor&quot;.

During the late 1960s a large transient population of Australian, New Zealand and white South African travellers began to use Earl&#x27;s Court as a UK hub and over time it gained the name &quot;Kangaroo Valley&quot;.

==Population==
Immediately after development, Earl&#x27;s Court was sought-after and had generally middle class population, apart from some poorer pockets. Multi-occupied homes and overcrowding existed in parts of Warwick Road and around Pembroke Place, inhabited mostly by laborers and working class families. Wealthier residents with many servants occupied the larger houses on Cromwell Road and Lexham Gardens.

Over time, the balance tipped from owner-occupiers to lodging houses and flats. By the 1890s, Booth&#x27;s poverty maps showed the area still wealthy overall but with signs of decline setting in. The large houses built for single families were increasingly converted to flats or operated as boarding houses catering to visitors to nearby Earl&#x27;s Court Exhibition Centre.

After World War II, the area became known for its transient population. Groups settling briefly included Polish refugees, Commonwealth migrants, Arabs, Iranians and Filipinos. The influx led to overcrowded housing conditions and neglect of properties. Some stability returned from the 1970s with residents&#x27; associations forming and upgrades to the housing stock. But Earl&#x27;s Court continued to be known for its rootless, shifting population compared to other more settled Kensington neighbourhoods. Thus, in 1991 it had 30% annual population turnover with almost a half of inhabitants born outside of the UK.

The Earl&#x27;s Court ward had a population of 9,104 according to the 2011 census.

The recent change in the area&#x27;s population is largely owed to rocketing property prices and the continued gentrification of the area. The scale of change is illustrated by the economic divide between the eastern and western areas of Earl&#x27;s Court. Despite fighting fiercely for the exhibition centre, according to Dave Hill in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the area&#x27;s economy has been destroyed by this imbalance and the destruction of the exhibition venue.

Earl&#x27;s Court may be within walking distance of High Street Kensington, Holland Park, Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park, the Royal Albert Hall, Imperial College, the Natural History, Science and Victoria and Albert Museums.

===Original gaiety===

The introduction of two Underground stations, and a mass network of railways trapped a triangle of land on the border of the original parishes of Kensington and Fulham. After an unsuccessful attempt to build a Catholic school on the site, the idea of expanding entertainment in the area was probably inspired by the existence of the Lillie Bridge Grounds popular sports facility, just inside the Fulham boundary, next to West Brompton station. The person who was to bring it to fruition was John Robinson Whitley, an entrepreneur from Leeds who used the land as a show-ground for a number of years from 1887. Whitley did not meet with business success, but his aspirations for Earl&#x27;s Court took hold for others to fulfil.

In 1895 the Great Wheel, a Ferris wheel, was created for the international impresario, Imre Kiralfy&#x27;s Empire of India Exhibition. A plaque in the former Earls Court venue commemorated some of these events and that the reclusive Queen Victoria was an occasional visitor to the many shows put on at the site. In 1897 Kiralfy had the &quot;Empress Hall&quot; built to seat 6,000 in neighbouring Fulham and he had the Earl&#x27;s Court grounds converted into the style of the 1893 Chicago White City for the Columbian Exposition. More was to come.

Not until 1937 was the Earls Court Exhibition Centre opened, with its striking Art Moderne façade facing Warwick Road. A new entrance to Earl&#x27;s Court tube station was constructed to facilitate easy access to the Exhibition Centre, including direct entrance from the underground passage which connects the District and Piccadilly lines. This was however closed in the 1980s at around the time the capacity of the Exhibition Centre was expanded by the construction of a second exhibition hall, Earl&#x27;s Court 2, which was opened by Princess Diana, herself a former Earl&#x27;s Court resident.

In its heyday the Earls Court Exhibition Centre hosted many of the leading national trade fairs, including the annual British International Motor Show (1937-1976) and Royal Smithfield Show, as well as Crufts dog show and the combined forces &quot;Royal Tournament&quot;, which gave its name to the public house (now demolished) on the corner of Eardley Crescent. The biggest trade fairs migrated to the National Exhibition Centre at Birmingham Airport when it opened in 1988. The longest-running annual show was the Ideal Home Show in April, which attracted tens of thousands of visitors. Otherwise, it was increasingly used as a live music venue, hosting events such as the farewell concert by the boy-band Take That. At the other end of the scale, it was also used for arena-style opera performances of Carmen and Aida. Archive Movietone newsreel footage (which can be seen on YouTube) captures a unique and powerful rehearsal of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under Wilhelm Furtwängler playing the end of Brahms&#x27; Fourth Symphony during a post-war reconciliation visit to London.

===Other highlights===
The &quot;Prince of Teck&quot; is a Grade II listed pub at Earl&#x27;s Court Road.

An early 1940s and 50s Bohemian haunt in the Earl&#x27;s Court Road was the café, &quot;el Cubano&quot;, which had piped music and an authentic Italian steam Gaggia coffee machine, a rarity in those days. It was few doors down from the bakery, &quot;Beaton&#x27;s&quot;, whose only other outlet was on the King&#x27;s Road, Chelsea. Also from that era was the theatre club, Bolton&#x27;s that in 1955 transformed into arthouse cinema, the &quot;Paris Pullman&quot; in Drayton Gardens.

&quot;The Troubadour&quot; is a coffee house and a small music venue, which has hosted emerging talent since 1954 – including Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and Elvis Costello.

The Drayton Arms is a Grade II listed public house at 153 Old Brompton Road, which is also a theatrical venue.

The &quot;Finborough Theatre&quot;, which opened in 1980, is the neighbourhood&#x27;s local theatre.

The area also has a police box of the type used for the &quot;TARDIS&quot; time machine in the BBC Television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The blue police box located outside Earl&#x27;s Court underground station in Earl&#x27;s Court Road is actually a replica of the traditional GPO police telephone boxes that were once a common sight in the UK from the early 1920s.

==Neighbourhoods==
Earl&#x27;s Court is a diverse and vibrant area that comprises several distinct neighborhoods, each with its own unique charm and architectural style. The primary neighborhoods in Earl&#x27;s Court are Courtfield and Earl&#x27;s Court Village to the east of Earl&#x27;s Court Road, and Nevern Square, Earl&#x27;s Court Square, and Philbeach to the west. Together, these areas form the character of Earl&#x27;s Court, reflecting the diverse styles and development patterns of the late 19th century in London.

The area is home to many multimillion-pound flats and houses in smart garden squares and residential streets. The southern boundary of Earl&#x27;s Court is Old Brompton Road, with the area to the west being West Brompton, and the area to the south east being the Beach area of Chelsea. The eastern boundary of Earl&#x27;s Court is Collingham Gardens and Collingham Road, east of which is South Kensington.

Further west, Kensington Mansions, Nevern Square and Philbeach Gardens are built around impressive formal garden settings (access limited to key holding residents). &quot;West Earl&#x27;s Court&quot;, lying to the west of Earl&#x27;s Court Road, is notably different in architecture. White stucco fronted &quot;boutique&quot; hotels in Trebovir Road and Templeton Place, and the impressive late-Victorian mansion flats and town houses of Earl&#x27;s Court Square, Nevern Square and Kensington Mansions

Earl&#x27;s Court Village is a triangular-shaped conservation area situated behind the bustling Earl’s Court Road and Cromwell Road, comprising Childs Place, Kenway Road, Wallgrave Road and Redfield Lane. The neighborhood retains a village-like charm, with late Georgian and Victorian terraced houses and shops. The buildings are made from a limited palette of materials, including London stock brick and stucco, with vertically sliding timber sash windows. Street trees and verdant front and rear gardens contribute to the picturesque streetscape. Hidden in the middle of this area is London&#x27;s smallest communal garden, &quot;Providence Patch&quot; built on the site of former stables serving the surrounding houses. A glimpse of the (private) gardens can be seen via the original stable entrance way in Wallgrave Road.
The Courtfield Conservation Area is a residential neighborhood surrounded by Cromwell Road to the north, Earl’s Court Road to the west, and Old Brompton Road to the south. The area is characterized by Victorian formal terraces, mature gardens, and generous road widths, with buildings primarily dating from 1870 to 1900. Courtfield boasts a mix of architectural styles, including Italianate and red brick terraces, and mansion blocks. The area is also known for its picturesque streetscape, with numerous mature street trees and lushly planted garden squares. Traditional cast iron railings around some areas such as the Courtfield Gardens have been restored (the originals having been removed on the orders of the MoD (UK) in 1940 for munitions during the Second World War) creating a more authentic Victorian ambience.

The Philbeach Conservation Area comprises a mix of mid-Victorian terraced houses, built mainly in the Italianate style. These homes feature pale gault brick frontages with stucco dressings, Roman Doric projecting porches, and sash windows. The area also includes St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, a Grade I listed building, and Philbeach Gardens.

Nevern Square Conservation Area showcases the evolution of architectural styles in the late 19th century. The area includes mid-late Victorian terraced houses, mansion flats, and the Grade II listed Earl&#x27;s Court Underground Station. The main focus is Nevern Square, a private garden square surrounded by elegant homes. Development in the area began in the Italianate style, transitioning to the Domestic Revival style, and finally to the construction of mansion flats. Gardens and green corridors play an essential role in the area&#x27;s character.

Earl&#x27;s Court Square Conservation Area, a predominantly residential area, lies to the south, surrounded by busy thoroughfares on the east, west, and south. The residential streets consist of terraced housing, semi-detached houses, and mansion blocks, all built in the mid-late Victorian period. The buildings share a common palette of materials, including yellow or red stock brick, stucco, and stone, with timber sash windows or casement windows. The area also has a commercial character along the southeastern boundary on Earl&#x27;s Court Road. Mature street trees, verdant planting, and communal gardens contribute to the area&#x27;s picturesque streetscape.

===Garden squares and mews===
The layout of much of the Earl&#x27;s Court differed in some respects from earlier developments, such as ones to the south of Old Brompton Road. Unlike the grand spaces of The Boltons or the more modest Ifield Road, the Gunter estate was characterized by the typical Kensington &quot;Gardens&quot; – rows of houses backing directly onto private (but communal) ornamental grounds. Even though not every house backed directly onto a garden, the houses still fronted onto the streets in orthodox fashion, rather than presenting their &quot;backs&quot; to the streets. Besides Collingham Gardens designed by Ernest George and Harold Peto, the rear views of the houses across the gardens were orderly and uniform.

Considerable importance was placed on the mews, with Hesper Mews laid out in 1884-85 as the largest and finest stable block under the supervision of various architects. Colbeck Mews (1876-84) also had architect-designed stables by George and Peto. Most mews had the typical arched entrance, and some like Hesper Mews presented attractive flank fronts to adjacent streets. Despite the prominence of mews, with over twice as many than south of Old Brompton Road, the number of individual units was only about a quarter of the houses.

Earl&#x27;s Court adds to the Royal Borough&#x27;s tally of almost 50 garden squares. Within SW5 they include:
The mews include:

==Gay area==

Earl&#x27;s Court preceded Soho and Vauxhall as London&#x27;s premier centre of gay nightlife, though the number of businesses aimed mostly at gay men has dwindled to a single retail outlet and bar, as Soho and Vauxhall established themselves as the new focus. The first public nightclub aimed at a gay clientele, the Copacabana, opened in Earl&#x27;s Court Road in the late 1970s, but was re-themed as a general venue in the late 1990s. The bar upstairs, Harpoon Louie&#x27;s (later Harpo&#x27;s and later still Banana Max), was until the late 1980s among the most popular gay bars in London. It is now a Jollibee restaurant.

The oldest pub on the site was the &quot;Lord Ranelagh&quot; pub (opposite the former Princess Beatrice Hospital) now demolished, that in 1964 spearheaded the local demand for live entertainment. A young, non-gay, male band, the Downtowners, attracted considerable attention. They persuaded many of the local cross-dressers to come into the pub and perform. Thus, the Queen of the Month contest was born. Every Saturday night the pub was packed to capacity. The show ran from September 1964 until May 1965 when the &quot;News of the World&quot; ran an article entitled &#x27;This show must not go on&#x27;. On that Sunday night the pub was so packed that every table and chair had to be removed. Crowds spilled out on to the pavement onto Old Brompton Road. The police closed the show. Many well-known celebrities were among the clientele and the Lord Ranelagh, in its incarnations as &quot;Bromptons&quot; and finally, &quot;Infinity&quot;, is considered to have played a role in the history of gay liberation. In the 1970s it became a notorious leather bar, with blacked-out windows, attracting an international crowd including the likes of Freddie Mercury, Kenny Everett, and Rudolf Nureyev. The pub was demolished after its closure.

The Pembroke pub, formerly the Coleherne, dates from the 1880s and had a long history of attracting a bohemian clientele before becoming known as a gay pub. A lifelong resident of Earl&#x27;s Court Square and social activist, Jennifer Ware, recollects as a child being taken there to Sunday lunch in the 1930s, when drag entertainers performed after lunch had finished. It also became infamous as the stalking ground for three separate serial killers from the 1970s to the 1990s: Dennis Nilsen, Michael Lupo and Colin Ireland. It sought to lighten its image with a makeover in the mid-1990s to attract a wider clientele; to no avail, as in December 2008 it underwent a major refurbishment and repositioned itself as a gastro pub with a new name.

==Transport==
===Tube stations===

* Earl&#x27;s Court tube station, served by the District and Piccadilly lines
* West Brompton station, served by the District line&#x27;s Wimbledon branch and London Overground
* Gloucester Road tube station, served by the Circle, District and Piccadilly lines

===Bus routes===
328, 430, 74, C1, C3.

These have replaced the former routes 31 that used to run from World&#x27;s End to Kilburn and the old bus route 74B that ran from Hammersmith to London Zoo.

===Major roads===
When Ernest Marples was transport minister (1962-1964), it was decided to turn part of Earl&#x27;s Court Road, from the junction with Pembroke Road, into a southward one-way arterial road and the parallel Warwick Road as the northward arterial road, going past the then Earl&#x27;s Court Exhibition Centre.
A third arterial road at right angles to the former two is the Cromwell Road, designated as the A4 that carries traffic between central London and Heathrow Airport and beyond to the West.
A fourth road that creates a box with the other three is the A 3218, Old Brompton Road, better described as a trunk road.

<doc id="355099" wikidata="Q1768180" url="?curid=355099" title="Nation (Sepultura album)">
<text>Nation is the eighth studio album by the Brazilian metal band Sepultura, released in 2001 through Roadrunner Records. &quot;Nation&quot; features guest appearances from artists such as Hatebreed singer Jamey Jasta, Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, Ill Niño singer Cristian Machado, Ratos de Porão frontman João Gordo, and Apocalyptica.

According to the official site, a video for &quot;One Man Army&quot; was scheduled to be filmed at the end of August 2001. However, due to a lack of support from Roadrunner Records, the video was never made. Sepultura blamed Roadrunner for not promoting the album and left for SPV in 2002.

== Reception ==

The album received better reviews than &quot;Against&quot;, but sold fewer copies. As of April 2002, &quot;Nation&quot; has sold over 55,700 copies in the U.S. and went gold in Brazil.

&quot;Q&quot; magazine (5/01, p. 118) – 3 stars out of 5 – &quot;A clutch of crowd-pleasingly brutal anthems...with a return to the more exploratory approach of old...the faithful will not be disappointed.&quot;

&quot;Alternative Press&quot; (5/01, p. 63) – 4 out of 5 – &quot;There are plenty of touchstones to [their] days of headbanger hegemony...[new singer] Derrick Green&#x27;s heightened tunefulness along with the broadened emotional resonance...should relate to an enlarged fanbase.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; (3/31/01, p. 31) – 6 out of 10 – &quot;Fiercely political and uncomprimisongly direct...it&#x27;s taut and tense and if you buy it quick you&#x27;ll get to hear their logic-defying cover of Bauhaus&#x27; &#x27;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&#x27;.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, especially representation theory, a quiver is another name for a multidigraph; that is, a directed graph where loops and multiple arrows between two vertices are allowed. Quivers are commonly used in representation theory: a representation  of a quiver assigns a vector space  to each vertex  of the quiver and a linear map  to each arrow .

In category theory, a quiver can be understood to be the underlying structure of a category, but without composition or a designation of identity morphisms. That is, there is a forgetful functor from (the category of categories) to (the category of multidigraphs). Its left adjoint is a free functor which, from a quiver, makes the corresponding free category.

==Definition==

A quiver consists of:
* The set of vertices of 
* The set of edges of 
* Two functions: giving the &quot;start&quot; or &quot;source&quot; of the edge, and another function, giving the &quot;target&quot; of the edge.

This definition is identical to that of a multidigraph.

A morphism of quivers is a mapping from vertices to vertices which takes directed edges to directed edges. Formally, if formula_1 and formula_2 are two quivers, then a morphism formula_3 of quivers consists of two functions formula_4 and formula_5 such that the following diagrams commute: 


That is,
:formula_6
and
:formula_7

==Category-theoretic definition==
The above definition is based in set theory; the category-theoretic definition generalizes this into a functor from the &quot;free quiver&quot; to the category of sets.

The free quiver (also called the walking quiver, Kronecker quiver, 2-Kronecker quiver or Kronecker category) is a category with two objects, and four morphisms: The objects are and . The four morphisms are and the identity morphisms and That is, the free quiver is the category

:formula_8

A quiver is then a functor . (That is to say, formula_9 specifies two sets formula_10 and formula_11, and two functions formula_12; this is the full extent of what it means to be a functor from formula_13 to formula_14.)

More generally, a quiver in a category is a functor The category of quivers in is the functor category where:

* objects are functors 
* morphisms are natural transformations between functors.

Note that is the category of presheaves on the opposite category .

==Path algebra==
If is a quiver, then a path in is a sequence of arrows 
:formula_15
such that the head of is the tail of for , using the convention of concatenating paths from right to left. Note that a path in graph theory has a stricter definition, and that this concept instead coincides with what in graph theory is called a &quot;walk&quot;.

If is a field then the quiver algebra or path algebra is defined as a vector space having all the paths (of length ≥ 0) in the quiver as basis (including, for each vertex of the quiver , a &quot;trivial path&quot; of length 0; these paths are &quot;not&quot; assumed to be equal for different ), and multiplication given by concatenation of paths. If two paths cannot be concatenated because the end vertex of the first is not equal to the starting vertex of the second, their product is defined to be zero. This defines an associative algebra over . This algebra has a unit element if and only if the quiver has only finitely many vertices. In this case, the modules over are naturally identified with the representations of . If the quiver has infinitely many vertices, then has an approximate identity given by formula_16 where ranges over finite subsets of the vertex set of .

If the quiver has finitely many vertices and arrows, and the end vertex and starting vertex of any path are always distinct (i.e. has no oriented cycles), then is a finite-dimensional hereditary algebra over . Conversely, if is algebraically closed, then any finite-dimensional, hereditary, associative algebra over is Morita equivalent to the path algebra of its Ext quiver (i.e., they have equivalent module categories).

== Representations of quivers ==

A representation of a quiver is an association of an -module to each vertex of , and a morphism between each module for each arrow.

A representation of a quiver is said to be &quot;trivial&quot; if formula_17 for all vertices in .

A &quot;morphism&quot;, between representations of the quiver , is a collection of linear maps such that for every arrow in from to , formula_18 i.e. the squares that forms with the arrows of and all commute. A morphism, , is an &quot;isomorphism&quot;, if is invertible for all vertices in the quiver. With these definitions the representations of a quiver form a category.

If and are representations of a quiver , then the direct sum of these representations, formula_19 is defined by formula_20 for all vertices in and formula_21 is the direct sum of the linear mappings and .

A representation is said to be &quot;decomposable&quot; if it is isomorphic to the direct sum of non-zero representations.

A categorical definition of a quiver representation can also be given. The quiver itself can be considered a category, where the vertices are objects and paths are morphisms. Then a representation of is just a covariant functor from this category to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. Morphisms of representations of are precisely natural transformations between the corresponding functors.

For a finite quiver (a quiver with finitely many vertices and edges), let be its path algebra. Let denote the trivial path at vertex . Then we can associate to the vertex  the projective -module consisting of linear combinations of paths which have starting vertex . This corresponds to the representation of obtained by putting a copy of at each vertex which lies on a path starting at and 0 on each other vertex. To each edge joining two copies of we associate the identity map.

This theory was related to cluster algebras by Derksen, Weyman, and Zelevinsky.

== Quiver with relations ==
To enforce commutativity of some squares inside a quiver a generalization is the notion of quivers with relations (also named bound quivers).
A relation on a quiver is a linear combination of paths from .
A quiver with relation is a pair with a quiver and formula_22 an
ideal of the path algebra. The quotient is the path algebra of .

===Quiver Variety===

Given the dimensions of the vector spaces assigned to every vertex, one can form a variety which characterizes all representations of that quiver with those specified dimensions, and consider stability conditions. These give quiver varieties, as constructed by .

== Gabriel&#x27;s theorem ==
A quiver is of finite type if it has only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations. classified all quivers of finite type, and also their indecomposable representations. More precisely, Gabriel&#x27;s theorem states that:

# A (connected) quiver is of finite type if and only if its underlying graph (when the directions of the arrows are ignored) is one of the ADE Dynkin diagrams: .
# The indecomposable representations are in a one-to-one correspondence with the positive roots of the root system of the Dynkin diagram.

 found a generalization of Gabriel&#x27;s theorem in which all Dynkin diagrams of finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras occur. This was generalized to all quivers and their corresponding Kac–Moody algebras by Victor Kac.

<text>Highcross Leicester is a shopping centre in Leicester, England. It was opened as The Shires in 1991 to supplement the Haymarket Shopping Centre, also since re-developed. It was built on a central location within the city centre on Eastgates and High Street. Frontages of buildings that were demolished were retained and new external construction was in a &#x27;neo-Victorian&#x27; vernacular. An extension opened in 1994, with a frontage on to Church Gate. A further large extension opened in 2008, when the entire centre was renamed Highcross Leicester.
Highcross Leicester contains over 100 shops, with a range of both large and smaller units, including branches of the department stores John Lewis &amp; Partners. There are also 40 restaurants and cafés, a Showcase Cinema de Lux and two large car parks.

==The Shires becomes Highcross Leicester==
The most recent extension, known as Shires West during the planning and early construction phases, doubles the retail space available. This extension lies between the former Shires and the inner ring-road. It includes a John Lewis department store and a Cinema de Lux, the only multiplex cinema in the city centre. There are also two new public squares, residential apartments, a bus interchange and a further 2000-space car park on the opposite side of the ring road, linked by a glass footbridge, which replaces one of the earlier Shires car parks that was demolished to make way for the new extension. Other new tenants include designer fashion brands G-star, Lacoste, Hugo Boss and Zara, and there is also an Apple Store . Thirteen new restaurants and cafés signed up to open in the new centre.

The extension makes Highcross Leicester the largest shopping centre in the East Midlands.

The Showcase Cinema de Lux and John Lewis parts of the centre mark the UK début of architecture firm Foreign Office Architects. The cinema is covered in a slightly buckled, stainless steel cladding, while the department store features two layers of glass, each with a swirling fabric design from John Lewis&#x27;s archives, allowing light in and a view out, but obscuring the interior from the outside. The use of a fabric pattern recognises Leicester&#x27;s past as a textile-producing city.
An open day was held on Sunday, 1 June 2008 to show the people around the new development. More than a thousand people attended. The newly extended and refurbished shopping centre opened to the public on 4 September 2008 with over 125,000 visitors and over a million visitors in its first two weeks. The new extension cost £350 million to construct and has been the largest regeneration project in the city for many years.
===Naming controversies===
On 14 July 2006, it was announced that the entire centre would be renamed the Highcross Quarter, relating to a Highcross that used to stand in what is now Highcross Street.
This received a mixed reaction, with criticism directed in particular at the use of the word &quot;quarter&quot; as opposed to &quot;centre&quot;.
On 19 July 2007, the principal owners of the development, Hammerson, announced that they had decided to change the new name for the centre to Highcross Leicester.

On 23 July 2007, the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; reported that the latest name change had been the result of a year-long dispute

with a local coven of witches, who pointed out that &quot;High Cross Quarter&quot; is the name of a high point or major sabbat in the wiccan calendar, and registered five

internet domain names relating to the name. Hammerson refused to comment on the dispute, and claimed that the name change was to &quot;give it a stronger identity for customers and raise the profile not only of the development but also the city.&quot;
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on 25 July 2007 that the Highcross Leicester developers had their offer to buy the domain names rejected.

Despite Hammerson saying they were no longer interested in the &quot;highcrossquarter&quot; domain names for the renamed Highcross Leicester development as the name had now &quot;evolved&quot;, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; reported that Hammerson had escalated the matter all the way to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva where it was seeking a ruling on ownership of the highcrossquarter.com domain name. On 30 August 2007, the WIPO ruled against Hammerson&#x27;s complaint.

<text>Röyksopp () a Norwegian electronic music duo from Tromsø formed in 1998. The duo consists of childhood friends Svein Berge and Torbjørn Brundtland who formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified their place in the electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, &quot;Melody A.M.&quot;, released on the Wall of Sound record label.

Röyksopp has consistently experimented with various genres pertaining to electronic music. Stylistically, the band makes use of various genres, including ambient, house music and synth-pop. The band is also known for its elaborate concert performances, which often feature eccentric outfits.

Since their 1998 debut, the duo has gained critical acclaim and popular success around the world. To date, Röyksopp has been nominated for two Grammy Awards, won seven Spellemannprisen awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums that have topped the charts in several countries, including four consecutive number-one albums in their native country.

== Band name ==
&quot;&quot; literally means &quot;smoke mushroom&quot;. It is the Norwegian word for the class of mushrooms known as puffball. The band&#x27;s name replaces the second letter (ø) with ö, which is non-existent in the Norwegian alphabet but corresponds to the same sound in the Swedish alphabet.

==History==

===1990–1997: Origins===
Berge and Brundtland were introduced to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway, when Berge was 12 years old and Brundtland was 13. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two began playing music together due to a shared interest in electronica, experimented with various forms of electronic music. They bought a drum machine together part of the Tromsø techno scene of the early 1990s. Their childhood in Tromsø and the natural scenery of Northern Norway have often been mentioned as some of their most important inspirations. The pair separated before obtaining any popular success with their music, but reunited with each other in 1998 in Bergen, Norway.

Bergen, a city of 212,944 people in 1990, had overtaken Tromsø&#x27;s position as the most vital scene for underground electronic music in Norway, and Röyksopp worked with other Norwegian musicians like Frost, Those Norwegians, Drum Island, and Kings of Convenience&#x27;s guitarist and singer Erlend Øye in what was called the Bergen Wave. During this time, the duo befriended Geir Jenssen. Under the tutelage of Jenssen, the duo started a band called Aedena Cycle with Gaute Barlindhaug and Kolbjørn Lyslo. In 1994 Aedena Cycle recorded a vinyl EP called &quot;Traveler&#x27;s Dreams&quot;. The EP was released under the R&amp;S Records sublabel Apollo. Following the release of the EP, Jenssen almost convinced the band to sign a full record deal with Apollo Records.

===1998–2000: Early years===
After recording as part of Aedena Cycle, Berge and Brundtland left the group to form their own band, Röyksopp. The word &quot;röyksopp&quot; is a stylized version of the Norwegian word for the puffball mushroom, &quot;røyksopp&quot;. The band has stated that the word could also evoke the mushroom cloud resulting from an atomic blast.

Röyksopp&#x27;s debut single was released by local Bergen Wave-era independent label Tellé. Röyksopp&#x27;s first single &quot;So Easy&quot;, which was later re-released on their first album, was the second record released by Tellé. After being used in a UK T-Mobile advertisement, &quot;So Easy&quot; became popular in the UK market and was later re-released, combined with their later single &quot;Remind Me&quot;.

===2001–2004: &quot;Melody A.M.&quot; and early success===

After leaving Tellé, the band signed with British label Wall of Sound and released &quot;Melody A.M.&quot;, which became certified platinum in the band&#x27;s native Norway and sold over a million copies worldwide. The album peaked at number one in Norway, and produced the UK Top 40 singles &quot;Eple&quot;, &quot;Poor Leno&quot;, and &quot;Remind Me&quot;. A final single, &quot;Sparks&quot;, was also released. Eple () meaning &quot;apple&quot; in Norwegian was licensed by Apple Inc. for use as the welcome music to the company&#x27;s Mac OS X Panther operating system, playing the first time a user booted a new Apple-brand computer.

The band&#x27;s popularity was boosted by several graphically experimental music videos, many of which were put into heavy rotation by MTV. The music video for &quot;Remind Me&quot;, featuring an infographic-style video by French company H5, won the 2002 MTV Europe Music Award for best music video. In this same event the duo was nominated in three more categories: &quot;Best Nordic Act&quot;, &quot;Best New Artist&quot; and &quot;Best Dance Act&quot;. The duo performed the song &quot;Poor Leno&quot; at the event. One year later they received a nomination for &quot;Best Group&quot; at the Brit Awards.

During this period Röyksopp slowly gained popularity in the United States. &quot;Remind Me&quot;, one of the two Röyksopp and Erlend Øye collaborations found on &quot;Melody A.M.&quot;, was featured in a Geico car insurance commercial, the fourth of the &quot;It&#x27;s so easy a caveman could do it&quot; ads.

During this time, Röyksopp were approached to compose the soundtrack for &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, although they declined the offer.

===2005–2008: &quot;The Understanding&quot;===
Röyksopp&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Understanding&quot;, was released on 12 July 2005, preceded by the single &quot;Only This Moment&quot; on 27 June 2005. The single managed to peak at number 33 in the United Kingdom. The video for &quot;Only This Moment&quot; is closely based on the events of the Paris 1968 riots, and elements of propaganda are found throughout the video clip. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;49 Percent&quot;, with the vocals of Chelonis R. Jones was released on 26 September 2005. A third single, &quot;What Else Is There?&quot;, including vocals from Swedish singer Karin Dreijer of The Knife, became the album&#x27;s biggest single, peaking at number 32 in the United Kingdom, and at number four in Norway. &quot;Beautiful Day Without You&quot; was the album&#x27;s fourth single, and a non-album track, &quot;Curves&quot;, was also released.

Building upon the success of &quot;Melody A.M.&quot;, &quot;The Understanding&quot; was very successful in Europe. The album peaked at number one in Norway, and at number 13 in the UK. During this time, Röyksopp&#x27;s popularity continued to increase in the United States. The album charted on many &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and peaked at number two on the Top Electronic Albums chart, number 22 on the Top Heatseekers chart, and number 32 on the Top Independent Albums.

After the release of &quot;The Understanding&quot;, some of Röyksopp&#x27;s singles were licensed for movie appearances. &quot;What Else Is There?&quot; was featured during a scene in the 2007 American film &quot;Meet Bill&quot; and during the end credits of the 2006 British film &quot;Cashback&quot;, and &quot;Circuit Breaker&quot; was used in the 2007 snowboard film &quot;Picture This&quot;.

On 19 June 2006, Röyksopp released a nine-track live album called &quot;Röyksopp&#x27;s Night Out&quot;. Notably, the album contains a reinterpretation of the song &quot;Go with the Flow&quot;, originally by Queens of the Stone Age.

On 5 March 2007, Röyksopp compiled their favourite tracks by other artists for the &quot;Back to Mine&quot; series. Called &quot;Back to Mine: Röyksopp&quot;, the album was released in the US on 5 March 2007, and in the UK on 27 April 2007. The album also includes their own track &quot;Meatball&quot;, released under the pseudonym &quot;Emmanuel Splice&quot;. Svein Berge also contributed as a board member for the celebration of the &quot;Grieg year&quot;, as Norway celebrated their famous composer Edvard Grieg.

On the tenth anniversary of Röyksopp&#x27;s formation—15 December 2008—the band released a new track, &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, free of charge to celebrate the event. The song was released via free streaming on the band&#x27;s website.

===2009–2012: &quot;Junior&quot; and &quot;Senior&quot;===
Röyksopp&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Junior&quot;, was released on 23 March 2009, featuring the single &quot;Happy Up Here&quot;. The song debuted on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Pete Tong show on 9 January 2009. It was officially released digitally on 16 March 2009. The music video for &quot;Happy Up Here&quot;, made by Reuben Sutherland, features elements from the arcade game &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. Both the single and the video were met with positive reactions from the press and fans.

&quot;The Girl and the Robot&quot;, the second single from the album &quot;Junior&quot;, featuring vocals from Swedish singer Robyn, was released on 15 June 2009. The vinyl and digital versions of the single included remixes of the song by Kris Menace, Chateau Marmont and Spencer &amp; Hill. At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the Jean Elan remix of &quot;The Girl and the Robot&quot; was nominated for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical. &quot;This Must Be It&quot; is the third single from the album, including vocals from Swedish singer Karin Dreijer of The Knife and Fever Ray. The single also featuring remixes by Thin White Duke, LehtMoJoe, Rex the Dog and Apparat, among others. The band later released the stems for the song &quot;Tricky Tricky&quot; as part of a remix competition and the winning entries were released on 27 October 2009.

&quot;Junior&quot; was a success around the world. The album peaked at number one in Norway, the band&#x27;s third consecutive release to do so. &quot;Junior&quot; also peaked at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart and charted on many &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200–the first Röyksopp release to do so–where it peaked at number 126. The album also peaked at number four on the Top Electronic Albums chart and number two on the Top Heatseekers chart.

&quot;Junior&quot; was followed by &quot;Senior&quot;, which is more quiet, &quot;withdrawn and introspective&quot; and &quot;create[s] an atmosphere and an ambiance&quot;. &quot;Senior&quot; is the duo&#x27;s first album to consist solely of instrumental tracks. The first single from the album, &quot;The Drug&quot;, was released on 9 August 2010. The album itself was released on 13 September 2010, and was successful in the band&#x27;s native Norway, peaking at number one, the band&#x27;s fourth consecutive release to do so.

===2013–2018: &quot;Do It Again&quot;, &quot;The Inevitable End&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Headspace&quot;===
In January 2013, Röyksopp released a song called &quot;Running to the Sea&quot;, a collaboration with Norwegian artist Susanne Sundfør. According to the band, the song was written and recorded in two days for a televised performance. The single was released on 16 December 2013, with a B-side containing a song called &quot;Something in My Heart&quot;, featuring Jamie McDermott from The Irrepressibles. Röyksopp and Sundfør also collaborated in creating a cover version of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Ice Machine&quot; for their Late Night Tales compilation album, &quot;Late Night Tales: Röyksopp&quot;.

On 14 April 2014, Röyksopp announced a collaborative EP with Robyn titled &quot;Do It Again&quot; to coincide with their joint tour. A snippet of one of the five tracks set to be released on the album, &quot;Monument&quot;, was released the same day. The album was released on 26 May through Dog Triumph, Wall of Sound, and Cooking Vinyl. The duo stated that a re-worked version of &quot;Monument&quot; would form a part of their next album. On 29 September 2014, Röyksopp announced that their next album, titled &quot;The Inevitable End&quot;, would explore &quot;darker subject matter with emphasis on the lyrical content&quot;, and would be their last LP, though they will not stop making music. The album was released on 7 November 2014 by Dog Triumph. The special edition of the album includes new versions of the previously released tracks &quot;Running to the Sea&quot;, &quot;Do It Again&quot; and &quot;Monument&quot; as well as the original version of &quot;Something in My Heart&quot;. Some singles did precede the release of the album: &quot;Skulls&quot;, &quot;Sordid Affair&quot; and the new version of &quot;Monument&quot;. &quot;Skulls&quot; and &quot;Monument&quot; were accompanied by two new video clips. The video for &quot;I Had This Thing&quot; was shared on 11 May 2015.

In early 2015, it was announced that the band had composed a musical accompaniment to a comedic work based upon the novels of Franz Kafka. The project debuted at the Bergen International Festival in the same year. Also in 2015, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK introduced a series of new jingles by Röyksopp for the TV output of the &quot;NRK Nyheter&quot; news division, as part of a comprehensive redesign of the sub-brand. The same year, they won the award for &quot;Best Cinematography&quot; at the Berlin Music Video Awards for their &quot;Skulls&quot; music video.

On 8 February 2016, Röyksopp announced that a new track titled &quot;Bounty Hunters&quot; would be included on the &quot;Star Wars Headspace&quot; compilation. The album was released on 19 February 2016. On 9 September 2016, Röyksopp released a new song, in collaboration with Susanne Sundfør, called &quot;Never Ever&quot;. Additional remixes of the song have been released between February and April 2017, including Röyksopp&#x27;s own club mix.

=== 2019–2021: &quot;Lost Tapes&quot; ===
In February 2019, the band announced that they would be releasing B-sides, exclusives and previously unreleased tracks through the &quot;Lost Tapes&quot; playlist, starting with &quot;I Wanna Know&quot; and &quot;Rising Urge&quot;. The tracks have been released for free on music streaming services, including Spotify and YouTube, but are also sold in digital stores like Amazon and the iTunes Store. In August 2019, Röyksopp released a collaborative single with Lars Vaular, called &quot;To minutter&quot;. The band kept releasing new &quot;Lost Tapes&quot; until 25 January 2021, when they announced the project has come to a halt for the time being. In August 2021, the physical edition of &quot;Lost Tapes&quot; was announced for release on 17 September 2021. It contains the first 10 tracks from the series and is available on vinyl, CD and cassette.

=== 2022–present: &quot;Profound Mysteries I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; ===
At the end of 2021, the band launched a new Instagram account which led to speculation of new music. Through a series of teasers with the tagline &quot;Press R&quot; on social media and snippets of new material on the redesigned official website, the band confirmed a new project would be released in 2022, titled &quot;Profound Mysteries&quot;.

Röyksopp described the &quot;conceptual project&quot; as an &quot;expanded creative universe&quot; and a &quot;continuous, holistic experience&quot;, suggesting the release of three albums in 2022 (listed on the website as red, yellow and green). Each release in the series was accompanied by a series of short-films from multiple directors and AI-generated &quot;artefacts&quot; and visualisers by an Australian artist Jonathan Zawada.

The two new songs were officially released in January 2022, &quot;(Nothing But) Ashes...&quot; and &quot;The Ladder&quot;, followed by &quot;Impossible&quot; (featuring Alison Goldfrapp) in February. The &quot;Profound Mysteries&quot; album was released on 29 April 2022, with the band hosting a livestream of the album, followed by a tease of the next album and snippets of new music on the official website.

On 14 June 2022, the band released &quot;Sorry&quot;, featuring Jamie Irrepressible as a lead single for &quot;Profound Mysteries II&quot;. At the same time the album became available for pre-order with &quot;Unity&quot;, featuring Karen Harding available alongside it. A collection of remixes was also released. The second album was released on 19 August 2022, with the band once again hosting a YouTube event and teasing the next album, officially confirming the trilogy. 

A number of individual songs were released in a run-up to the third and final album, starting with &quot;Speed King&quot; and &quot;The Night&quot; in August 2022. &quot;Profound Mysteries III&quot; was released on 18 November 2022 and features collaborations with Jamie Irrepressible, Alison Goldfrapp, Susanne Sundfør and Astrid S, among other artists. The series has been also released on vinyl for the first time, as 6LP boxset featuring all three albums and individual 2LP releases. 

In 2023, the duo embarked on a headline tour and continued to release new remixes of the tracks from the &quot;Profound Mysteries&quot; series. The True Electric tour began in February 2023, with shows in European cities, including Stockholm, London and Berlin. The band described the tour as &quot;energetic beats meet vast, transcending soundscapes&quot; and explained their wish to bring &quot;the pure and immersive Röyksopp experience&quot; of studio productions to the stage. The shows were followed by appearances at various summer festivals in Europe including Bilbao BBK Live and Rock Werchter. The band continued their headline tour in autumn 2023 with 16 concerts in North America and Europe.

In December 2024, the duo surprise released &quot;Nebulous Nights (An Ambient Excursion into Profound Mysteries)&quot;, a 30-track ambient reinterpretation of their &quot;Profound Mysteries&quot; project, on streaming services. Each one of the thirty tracks is a reimagining of its counterpart on &quot;Profound Mysteries&quot; Parts I-III.

==Style==

===Musical style===
Röyksopp&#x27;s music is often referred to as &quot;warm&quot;, a reference to the band&#x27;s downbeat electronica that combines elements of house music and Afro-American sounds. Röyksopp prefer to use analogue synthesizers over digital ones, with Svein Berge noting in an interview that &quot;it&#x27;s fairly limited, the fun you can have with the use of a mouse. We like to mix.&quot; In terms of specific instruments, the band generally favor vintage synthesizers and instruments from the 1970s and early 1980s, such as the Yamaha CS-80, the Mellotron Mk2, the Korg PS-3100, the monophonic Korg MS-20, the polyphonic Roland Juno-106, and the Synthe Korg 100 mono bass synth. When producing their earlier albums, the band also made heavy use of Akai samplers. To further create their unique sound, the band makes use of the Roland Space Echo, &quot;an old Danish tube compressor that doesn’t really have a name,&quot; and a reverb unit taken from an old radio station.

A notable component of Röyksopp&#x27;s repertoire is their use of multiple lead vocalists. For instance, &quot;Melody A.M.&quot; features the vocal talents of Anneli Drecker and Erlend Øye, &quot;The Understanding&quot; features Kate Havnevik, Chelonis R. Jones, and Karin Dreijer, and &quot;Junior&quot; features Robyn, Anneli Drecker, Karin Dreijer, and Lykke Li.

In addition to writing their own music, the duo enjoy remixing songs. Berge said, &quot;It&#x27;s obviously fun remixing people like Coldplay, artists of such a big calibre. Whenever people approach us for a remix it&#x27;s very nice; being approached by Roots Manuva, The Streets, and even Peter Gabriel is quite fun.&quot; The band was also asked by Britney Spears for a remix, but had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts.

===Influences===
As they grew up in Tromsø in northern Norway, Svein Berge and Torbjørn Brundtland listened to local artists like Bel Canto and former Bel Canto member Biosphere (whom, coincidentally, Berge and Brundtland would remix in 1997 while they were part of Alanïa). The band has also expressed their interest in the music of Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, Giorgio Moroder, Art of Noise, Vangelis, Erik Satie, and Francis Lai. Svein Berge has also stated that he is very fond of the production and programming skills of Datassette, who produced a remix of the Röyksopp single &quot;Happy Up Here&quot;.

Röyksopp often include references and homages to their musical influences. For instance, &quot;Röyksopp Forever&quot; pays homage to famous electronica musicians from the 1970s, including, &quot;the likes of Vangelis and these people, and Krautrock, like Tangerine Dream and even Pink Floyd and King Crimson.&quot;

===Live performances===
Röyksopp is known for its elaborate concert performances. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media said that &quot;Those who have heard Röyksopp&#x27;s two albums ... won&#x27;t be surprised to learn the Norwegian duo&#x27;s live set is much better and more raucuous than hunching next to the speakers at yer local Crate &amp; Barrel&quot;. When performing live, the duo often appear in eccentric outfits. Ari Stein, of Electronic Beats, said, that during one particular live set, &quot;Röyksopp returned with two separate encores, one which included Berge playing &quot;Eple&quot; with a space suit capsule on his head&quot;.

== Reception and awards ==
===Critical reception===
In addition to sales success, Röyksopp has garnered generally positive reception from many music critics. The band has also been nominated for many prestigious awards, including multiple Spellemannprisens and a Grammy.

The tracks &quot;What Else Is There?&quot; and &quot;Eple&quot; were chosen among the top 500 tracks of the decade by Pitchfork Media and placed in 375th and 336th place respectively. Another track written by Röyksopp, Annie&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, was placed 17th on the same list. On 24 November 2009, &quot;Melody A.M.&quot; was named the best Norwegian album of the decade by Norway&#x27;s largest newspaper, &quot;Verdens Gang&quot;. &quot;The Understanding&quot; came 5th on the same list. In a ranking of the top 10 Norwegian tracks of the decade by VG, &quot;Eple&quot; and &quot;What Else Is There?&quot; were placed 3rd and 6th respectively.

However, some criticism has been aimed at the repetitive nature of the band and the trip hop genre in general. Robert Christgau said that, &quot;chill-out tends toward waiting-room music for plastic surgeons who really want you to order that butt implant. Where once [Röyksopp] were extolled for their subtle melodicism, here their schlock candidly attacks the jugular. If they&#x27;re Air, Goldie was Tricky.&quot; Pitchfork Media, in their review of &quot;Senior&quot;, said that &quot;the kind of downtempo stuff that makes up the majority of Röyksopp&#x27;s vocal-less compositions just doesn&#x27;t hold up to concentrated, repeated listens like many other forms of instrumental electronic music.&quot;

<doc id="355109" wikidata="Q680621" url="?curid=355109" title="Soulfly (Soulfly album)">
<text>Soulfly is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Soulfly, released on April 21, 1998, through Roadrunner Records. The record was released in memory of frontman Max Cavalera&#x27;s deceased stepson and was the first album featuring Cavalera since leaving Sepultura two years prior. &quot;Soulfly&quot; has been certified gold by the RIAA.

==Album information==
The record features many guests, including members of Nação Zumbi, Fear Factory, Limp Bizkit, Cypress Hill, Deftones, and Dub War.

&quot;The Song Remains Insane&quot; is pieced together by two other songs, opening with a cover of &quot;Caos&quot; by Ratos de Porão and secondly a brief reckless hardcore rendition of &quot;Attitude&quot; by Sepultura. &quot;Umbabarauma&quot; is a cover of a 1976 song by Brazilian musician Jorge Ben Jor, which originally featured on his album &quot;África Brasil&quot;.

The breakdown riff in &quot;Tribe&quot; originated during Max&#x27;s time still in Sepultura - most likely created during on-the-road demo jams during the Roots tour though evidently never recorded in any complete demo form. As such, the riff was also used by Sepultura members Andreas Kisser and Igor Cavalera as the main riff to &#x27;Walkman&#x27; during their scoring of the movie No Coracao Dos Deuses, recorded the same year as Soulfly&#x27;s &#x27;Tribe&#x27;.

In 2008, speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Max Cavalera remembered:It was so hard to start over, having been in Sepultura for so long. In fact, it was harder getting Soulfly going than it was getting Sepultura started. Coming into a whole new situation underneath the shadow of &quot;Roots&quot; was a huge challenge for me, and most people thought I was nuts. Plus, we made a conscious effort not to sound like Sepultura. My choice of musicians took me away from straight metal and into a vibe that embraced a lot more, while still being heavy. Part of the magic was working with some of my all-time favourite Brazilian musicians and that really pushed me to write some great and some very different sounding music. Eye For an Eye is still my favourite, man, and I also like Tribe. That&#x27;s like an anthem for all metalheads.

<doc id="355112" wikidata="Q1929929" url="?curid=355112" title="Primitive (Soulfly album)">
<text>Primitive is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Soulfly, released in 2000 through Roadrunner Records. As of 2002, &quot;Primitive&quot; has sold over 226,569 copies as reported by SoundScan.

==Songs==
The first track of &quot;Primitive&quot; is &quot;Back to the Primitive&quot;, which plays berimbau to begin the song and the album. &quot;Back to the Primitive&quot; is one of three singles released from the album, others were &quot;Son Song&quot; and &quot;Jumpdafuckup&quot;.

&quot;Jumpdafuckup&quot; features Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour on vocals, as well as sludgy guitar riffs. &quot;Mulambo&quot; appears in the movie &quot;The Forsaken&quot;. &quot;Terrorist&quot; incorporates lyrics from songs recorded by other bands: &quot;Inner Self&quot; by Sepultura and &quot;Criminally Insane&quot; by Slayer. In addition, &quot;Terrorist&quot; features Slayer vocalist Tom Araya.

&quot;Son Song&quot; pays tribute both singers&#x27; fathers who died young. Sean Lennon&#x27;s father, John Lennon, was shot, while Max&#x27;s father died from a heart attack. Musically, &quot;Son Song&quot; has Alice in Chains-like grungy riffs and Layne Staley-like vocals by Lennon. The song appears on the &quot;Valentine OST&quot;, although it&#x27;s not included in the film.

&quot;In Memory of...&quot; is unique for Soulfly in that it contains rap elements. &quot;Soulfly II&quot; is the sequel to the first eponymously titled song, which uses a large number of instruments, including Congo drums, piano, sitar, twang, and various wind instruments. Asha Rabouin makes her first Soulfly appearance on &quot;Flyhigh&quot;, in which she sings lines like &#x27;Just let my soul fly free&#x27;.

==Reception==

*&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (9/28/00, pp. 53–4) - 3.5 stars out of 5 - &quot;Old-school...Primitive is deeper...in the sound of [ex-Sepultura frontman] Max Cavalera&#x27;s lived-in growl, the churning effect of a 4-string guitar and his concerns.&quot;
*&quot;Q&quot; magazine (11/00, pp. 114–6) - 3 stars out of 5 - &quot;While [their] percussive, ethnic grooves certainly make an impact, it&#x27;s only when Cavalera allows his formula to be altered by others that sparks truly fly.&quot;
*&quot;Alternative Press&quot; (11/00, p. 128) - 3 out of 5 - &quot;With pre-millennial speed metal rubbing elbows with hip-hop, excursions into ambient instrumentals and acerbic soul, and a host of guests...Primitive is certainly a record [with] breadth.&quot;
*&quot;CMJ&quot; (8/28/00, p. 32) - &quot;More relaxed than their debut, the low-end slaughterhouse riffs are still embellished with Cavalera&#x27;s beloved tribal percussion...[It] locks its teeth into the jugular.&quot;
*&quot;Melody Maker&quot; (10/10/00, p. 50) - 4 stars out of 5 - &quot;The metal album of the year so far...An incendiary blend of nu metal, reggae and Brazilian rhythms.&quot;
*&quot;NME&quot; (11/4/00, p. 46) - 7 out of 10 - &quot;Draws on Max&#x27;s political rage at colonial history and crimes of the conquistadors...the heavy metal Bob Marley.&quot;

<text>William Tierney Clark FRS FRAS (23 August 1783 – 22 September 1852) was an English civil engineer particularly associated with the design and construction of bridges. He was among the earliest designers of suspension bridges.

Born in Bristol, he was initially apprenticed to a local millwright and – guided by noted engineers Thomas Telford and John Rennie – he progressed to practice as a consulting civil engineer, moving to London where, from 1811, he was also engineer to the West Middlesex Waterworks Company (the engine house and other buildings involved in a scheme to pump water from reservoirs at Barnes to Hammersmith and other parts of London were designed by him).

He designed the first suspension bridge to span the River Thames in London: Hammersmith Bridge, opened in 1827. He also designed the Marlow Bridge, a suspension bridge across the Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire (built 1829–32) and Norfolk Bridge, a suspension bridge over the River Adur in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex (designed with Captain Samuel Brown, opened in 1834, replaced in 1923).

Internationally, he is revered for his design of the Széchenyi Chain Bridge across the Danube in Budapest, Hungary, for which Marlow Bridge was a nearly identical, but smaller, prototype. The first bridge linking Buda and Pest, it was designed by Tierney Clark in 1839, with construction supervised locally by Scotsman Adam Clark (no relation). It opened in 1849.

Tierney Clark is also credited with the design of a tunnel between Higham and Frindsbury, near Rochester in north Kent for the Thames and Medway Canal. The canal was not a success but the tunnel was acquired in 1846 and adapted in 1847 for use by the South Eastern Railway for its North Kent Line route between Gravesend and Rochester.

He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers.

Tierney Clark lived and died in Hammersmith in Middlesex. His memorial in the local parish church, St Paul’s, shows an outline of his design for the nearby bridge. His bridge has since been replaced by a later one designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, which reuses the Tierney Clark pier foundations.

Hungary commemorates Clark by an annual Tierney Clark Award for Civil Engineering presented by the Association of Hungarian Consulting Engineers and Architects.

<text>3 is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Soulfly released in 2002 through Roadrunner Records. &quot;3&quot; has sold 195,000 copies as of March 11, 2008.

==Album information==
The album artwork features an Om (ॐ), a spiritual icon in Indian religions. The original title for the album was &quot;Downstroy&quot;, after the opening track of the album. Max Cavalera later stated that he regretted changing the album&#x27;s title.

===Songs===
Both of the first two tracks were the only singles released from the album, &quot;Downstroy&quot; and &quot;Seek &#x27;n&#x27; Strike.&quot;

The song &quot;One&quot; features guest vocals from Ill Nino’s Christian Machado and uses the title as first word of the two word clauses per line: &#x27;One soul / One heart / One man / One truth / One tribe / One life / One God&#x27;. &quot;L.O.T.M&quot; (acronym for &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;) is a Native American-themed metal song named after the 1826 novel of the same name. &quot;Brasil&quot; is a Brazilian metal song featuring berimbau, as well as percussion performed by Cavalera.

&quot;One Nation&quot;, a cover song originally by Sacred Reich, features guitarist Wiley Arnett and drummer Greg Hall of Sacred Reich as guest musicians. &quot;09-11-01&quot; is a one-minute silence used for listeners to tribute to the victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorism acts on the World Trade Center.

&quot;Tree of Pain&quot; is a tribute to Cavalera&#x27;s late stepson Dana. &quot;Zumbi&quot; and &quot;Soulfly III&quot; are world music songs.

==Reception==
*&quot;Spin&quot; (8/02, p. 110) rated the album a 6 out of 10, stating that &quot;There&#x27;s something undeniably thrilling about an Ozzfest demagogue who champions dignity as a human right and makes a maxim like &#x27;Faith is a weapon&#x27; his rallying cry...the band remains a hard-charging, tribal-drumming monster fierce enough to kick the bulldozers out of the rainforest...3 could be the charm for Soulfly.&quot;
*&quot;NME&quot; (6/22/02, p. 52) also rated the album a 6 out of 10 stating that &quot;Another clench-jawed grind through seven kinds of hell...Soulfly must be the only band who can make the obligatory minute of Sept. 11th silence seem loud.&quot;
*&quot;Alternative Press&quot; (8/02, p. 67) rated the album a 7 out of 10 stating that &quot;Streamlined and digestable...A impenitent tone is set from the start...enough to get the troops of doom marching once again.&quot;
*&quot;CMJ&quot; (6/17/02, p. 16) stated that &quot;This one is a winner; don&#x27;t miss out.&quot;

<doc id="355127" wikidata="Q1137419" url="?curid=355127" title="Kʼicheʼ people">
<text>Kʼicheʼ (pronounced ; previous Spanish spelling: ) are Indigenous peoples of the Americas and are one of the Maya peoples. The eponymous Kʼicheʼ language is a Mesoamerican language in the Mayan language family. The highland Kʼicheʼ states in the pre-Columbian era are associated with the ancient Maya civilization, and reached the peak of their power and influence during the Mayan Postclassic period (–1539 AD).

The meaning of the word in the Kʼicheʼ language is &quot;many trees&quot;. The Nahuatl translation, &quot;Place of the Many Trees (People)&quot;, is the origin of the word &quot;Guatemala&quot;. Quiché Department is also named after them. Rigoberta Menchú Tum, an activist for Indigenous rights who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, is perhaps the best-known Kʼicheʼ person.

==People==
According to the 2011 census, Kʼicheʼ people constituted 11% of the Guatemalan population, accounting for 1,610,013 people out of a total of 14,636,487. The large majority of Kʼicheʼ people live in the highlands of Guatemala, notably in the departments of El Quiché, which is 65.1% Kʼicheʼ and has a total Kʼicheʼ population of 622,163; Totonicapán, which is 95.9% Kʼicheʼ and has a total Kʼicheʼ population of 453,237; Quetzaltenango, which is 25.9% Kʼicheʼ and has a total Kʼicheʼ population of 205,228; and Sololá, which is 35.3% Kʼicheʼ and has a total Kʼicheʼ population of 151,992.

El Quiché forms the heartland of the Kʼicheʼ people. In pre-Columbian times, the Kʼicheʼ settlements and influence reached beyond the highlands, including the valley of Antigua and coastal areas in Escuintla.

Most Kʼicheʼ speak their native language and have at least a working knowledge of Spanish. Exceptions are in some remote and isolated rural communities, where the people speak only Kʼicheʼ. Maya languages closely related to Kʼicheʼ are Uspantek, Sakapultek, Kaqchikel and Tzutujil.

== History ==

The history of the Kʼicheʼ people can be divided into two main historical periods, pre-conquest and post-conquest. Conquest occurred in 1524 with the arrival of the conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, who conducted war against this people.

=== Pre-Conquest ===
In pre-Conquest times, the Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj was one of the most powerful states in the region. &quot;Kʼiche&quot;&#x27; was an independent state that existed after the decline of the Maya Civilization with the Classic collapse (c.300 – c.950 AD). Kʼicheʼ lay in a highland mountain valley of present-day Guatemala; during this time they were also found in parts of El Salvador.

The major city of the Kʼicheʼ in the western highlands of Guatemala was Qʼumarkaj. It was the political, ceremonial and social center of the Kʼicheʼ people. The city covered an estimated area of 3.25 km2 across the Resguardo plateau. There is also evidence for a large degree of cultural exchange between the Kʼicheʼ and the people of Central Mexico. Linguists have found Nahuatl influences in the Kʼicheʼ language. Up until the 16th century before conquest K&#x27;iche were a literate civilization, creating hieroglyphs and pictographs which helped preserve their culture.

=== Post-Conquest ===
The Kʼicheʼ were conquered by the conquistador Pedro de Alvarado in 1524. Their last military commander, Tecun Uman, led the Kʼicheʼ armies against the combined forces of Alvarado and his allies, the Kaqchikel. The battle took place in the valley of Xelajú (Quetzaltenango) where the Kʼicheʼ armies were defeated and close to 10,000 Kʼicheʼ died, including Tecún Umán. Tecún has since been an important legendary figure in the Kʼicheʼ oral tradition. After the battle, the Kʼicheʼ surrendered and invited Alvarado to their capital, Qʼumarkaj. However, Alvarado suspected an ambush and had the city burned. The ruins of the city can still be seen, just a short distance from Santa Cruz del Quiché.

One of the main missions of the Spanish clergy during the conquest was to convert the Mesoamerican people to Catholic Christianity. Though they never fully converted the people, they did affect their language. The Kʼicheʼ people were one of the first groups studied by the Catholic missionary religious order known as the Dominicans. The Franciscans established &quot;Theologia Indorum&quot;, a Christian theology text written in the Kʼicheʼ native language and adapting K&#x27;iche&#x27; concepts to Catholicism. The text was meant to be a tool for converting the Kʼicheʼ and other Mesoamerican groups to Christianity. To accomplish this, the Dominicans attempted to change the meaning of some native words to better reflect their Catholic concepts. They also used similar word, sentence, and rhythmic structure to the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; to create similarities between the texts.

=== Twentieth century ===
In the early 1980s, the government of Guatemala, under the leadership of Efraín Ríos Montt, carried out a massive campaign to quell both the rebellions largely organized by the Mayan people and the spread of liberation ideas inspired by the Catholic church.  Because the K&#x27;iche&#x27; are the largest Maya group within Guatemala, they became a major target of the counterinsurgency programs, which developed into what is now known as the Guatemalan genocide.  The tactics of the Guatemalan army to fight the insurgency ranged from desecrating sacred symbols and burning crops, to raping Mayan women, mutilating and displaying Mayan bodies, and coercing Mayan men into Civil Defense Patrols.  According to the Guatemalan Historical Clarification Commission, Maya people in Southern Él Quiché were 98.4% of total victims.

Because of the disproportionate targeting of native peoples, the K&#x27;iche&#x27; people who inhabit Southern Él Quiché continue to be affected by the government&#x27;s counterinsurgency programs.  However, scholars have pointed out the differences between Western ideas of trauma and the Mesoamerican understanding.  The Guatemalan Historical Clarification Commission has emphasized the need for mental health solutions that highlight community development and human rights.  Previous efforts to provide relief have included encouraging natives to provide testimonies on Ríos Montt&#x27;s actions, reburying family members who were previously thrown in mass graves, and training community volunteers to accompany affected people and provide support.

=== Twenty-first Century ===

Up until 2012, Rios Montt served in Congress, which granted him immunity from prosecution. In 2013, Rios Montt and his armed forces were charged with the massacres of 15 villages in the K&#x27;iche&#x27; area. Rios Montt declared innocence throughout the trial, and was convicted for crimes against humanity and sentenced to 80 years in prison. Rios Montt&#x27;s conviction was overturned by Constitutional court due to lobbying by the country&#x27;s business elite, issuing a retrial that was delayed when a judge recused herself. Eventually in 2017, the retrial began but since Rios Montt was diagnosed with dementia, the trial was closed to the public, and Rios Montt was not required to be there. He died in his home while the trial was ongoing, in April 2018.

== Notable figures ==

=== Kʼicheʼ rulers ===
The origin of the elite Kʼicheʼ rulers is debated but scholars widely believe that the warlords traveled to the Guatemalan highlands in AD 1225. They began their migration after the collapse of the Yucatàn Maya center of Chichén Itzá, which is believed to have taken place around AD 1200. The elite warlords followed the Río Usumacinta drainage, the Río Negro, and Río Agua Caliente until they crossed into the San Andres Basin, where they began early Kʼicheʼ settlements. These warlords were in small groups that were very mobile and consisted mostly of men. They began to intermingle with the local Kʼicheʼ populations soon after their arrival. A chronological list of the rulers can be made by using generation lengths from the first ruler and so on.

=== Tecun Uman ===

Declared Guatemala&#x27;s national hero in 1960, Tecun Uman was the last of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; rulers. His death on February 20, 1524 is memorialized each year by the Guatemalan people. This is done, in part, through the Dance of the Conquest, which tells the story of the natives&#x27; conversion to Christianity following the Spanish Conquest. K&#x27;iche&#x27; documents, such as the &quot;Título Xecul&quot;, detail his immense wealth, stating that he wore quetzal feathers, rare gems, and abundant jewelry.

Some scholars doubt the existence of Tecun Uman as a historical figure, citing stories of the leader flying as a quetzal or an eagle in K&#x27;iche&#x27; stories.  Other scholars claim that, instead, Tecun Uman&#x27;s legacy is the result of a mythologized version of a historical figure.

=== Rigoberta Menchú Tum ===
Rigoberta Menchú Tum is an Indigenous rights activist who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992.  As a young woman, Menchu began advocating for the women&#x27;s rights movement through the Catholic Church in Guatemala.  She later joined the Committee for Peasant Unity (CUC) along with her father to advocate for better labor conditions for farmers. During the rule of General Efrain Rios Montt, Menchú protested the government&#x27;s counterinsurgency programs with her family, claiming that they were the result of cultural and socioeconomic tensions. After her father, mother, and brother were murdered by the Guatemalan government for their involvement in these protests, Menchú fled to Mexico. While in exile, she published her autobiography, which highlighted the Guatemalan Civil War and the violence committed against her family and the K&#x27;iche&#x27; people.

In 1996, Rigoberta Menchu became a UN Ambassador for the world&#x27;s Indigenous peoples and helped promote the first International Decade of the World&#x27;s Indigenous People. Since then, she has run for President of Guatemala in both 2007 and 2011 as a member of the left-leaning Winaq party but lost both elections by a large majority.

=== Luis Enrique Sam Colop ===
Luis Enrique Sam Colop is a K&#x27;iche&#x27;an writer who is most known for his accomplishment in translating the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; from K&#x27;iche&#x27; into modern Spanish while bringing back the original poetry element. Sam was born a native K&#x27;iche&#x27; speaker and also learned Spanish. He attended Rafael Landivar University in Guatemala, graduating with a degree in law. He later achieved his master&#x27;s degree in linguistics from the University of Iowa. Additionally, he holds a doctorate in English from the State University of New York with a dissertation on Mayan poetry. For his work on the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, he received a grant from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation for advanced professionals.

== Literature ==
=== Popol Vuh ===
One of the most significant surviving Mesoamerican literary documents and primary sources of knowledge about Maya societal traditions, beliefs and mythology is a product of the 16th-century Kʼicheʼ people. This document, known as the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; (&quot;Pop wuj&quot; in proper Kʼiche – &quot;the book of events&quot;) and originally written around the 1550s, contains a compilation of mythological and ethno-historical narratives known to these people at that time. These were drawn from earlier pre-Columbian sources (now lost) and also oral traditions. This sacred narrative includes their creation myth, relating how the world and humans were created by the gods, the story of the divine brothers, and the history of the Kʼicheʼ from their migration into their homeland up to the Spanish conquest.

′The &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, from its creation to present day, has developed as an important symbol of Indigenous culture for both present-day Guatemalans and people of Mayan descent. This sacred text has been used in religious and spiritual ceremonies, university studies, political movements and protests, and historical research into the lives of the Mayans and, more specifically, the Kʼicheʼ people. In 1971 it was declared the official book of Guatemala. The &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; has been used by people of Mayan descent in present-day Guatemala to defend their traditional lands and political rights in order to preserve their Indigenous culture. To this day, the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; continues to be analyzed and studied to better understand the spiritual beliefs and practices of the Maya, and how these have shaped present-day cultures.

<doc id="355128" wikidata="Q380090" url="?curid=355128" title="Hobbing">
<text>Hobbing is a machining process for gear cutting, cutting splines, and cutting sprockets using a specialized milling machine. The teeth or splines of the gear are progressively cut into the material (such as a flat, cylindrical piece of metal or thermoset plastic) by a series of cuts made by a cutting tool.

Hobbing is relatively fast and inexpensive compared to most other gear-forming processes and is used for a broad range of parts and quantities. Hobbing is especially common for machining spur and helical gears.

A type of skiving that is analogous to the hobbing of external gears can be applied to the cutting of internal gears, which are skived with a rotary cutter (rather than shaped or broached).

== History ==

Christian Schiele of Lancaster, England patented the hobbing machine in 1856. It was a simple design, but the rudimentary components are all present in the customary patent drawings. The hob cutting tool and the gear train to provide the appropriate spindle speed ratio are clearly visible. Knowledge of hobbing within the watchmaking trade likely precedes his patent. The next major step forward was in 1897, when Herman Pfauter invented a machine that could cut both traditional “spur” gears and helical gears, driving production further forward.

== Process ==

Hobbing can create gears that are straight, helical, straight bevel, faced, crowned, wormed, cylkro and chamfered. A hobbing machine uses two skew spindles. One is mounted with a blank workpiece and the other holds the cutter (or “hob”). The angle between the hob&#x27;s spindle (axis) and the workpiece&#x27;s spindle varies depending on the type of part being manufactured. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, the spindle is held at the lead angle of the hob, whereas if a helical gear is being produced, the held at the lead angle of the hob plus the helix angle of the helical gear. The speeds of the two spindles are held at a constant proportion determined by the number of teeth being cut into the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob with a gear ratio of 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, producing 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads, the speed ratio is multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. To finish the operation, the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank&#x27;s axis of rotation.

Often during mass production, multiple blanks are stacked using a suitable fixture and cut in one operation.

For very large gears, the blank may be preliminarily gashed to a rough shape to make hobbing more efficient.

== Equipment ==



Hobbing machines, also known as &quot;hobbers&quot;, come in many sizes to produce different sizes of gears. Tiny instrument gears are produced on small table-top machines, while large-diameter marine gears are produced on large industrial machines. A hobbing machine typically consists of a chuck and tailstock to hold the workpiece, a spindle to mount the hob, and a drive motor.

For a tooth profile which is theoretically involute, the fundamental rack is straight-sided, with sides inclined at the pressure angle of the tooth form, with flat top and bottom. The necessary addendum correction to allow the use of small-numbered pinions can either be obtained by suitable modification of this rack to a cycloidal form at the tips, or by hobbing at a diameter other than the theoretical pitch. Since the gear ratio between hob and blank is fixed, the resulting gear will have the correct pitch on the pitch circle but the tooth thickness will not be equal to the space width.

Hobbing machines are characterized by the largest module or pitch diameter it can generate. For example, a capacity machine can generate gears with a 10 in pitch diameter and usually a maximum of a 10 in face width. Most hobbing machines are vertical hobbers, meaning the blank is mounted vertically. Horizontal hobbing machines are usually used for cutting longer workpieces; i.e. cutting splines on the end of a shaft.

The &quot;hob&quot; is a cutting tool used to cut the teeth into the workpiece. It is cylindrical in shape with cutting teeth. These teeth have grooves that run the length of the hob, which aid in cutting and chip removal. There are also special hobs designed for special gears such as the spline and sprocket gears.

The cross-sectional shape of the hob teeth are almost the same shape as teeth of a rack gear that would be used with the finished product. There are slight changes to the shape for generating purposes, such as extending the hob&#x27;s tooth length to create a clearance in the gear&#x27;s roots. Each hob tooth is relieved on its back side to reduce friction.

Most hobs are single-thread hobs, but double-, and triple-thread hobs are used for high production volume shops. Multiple-thread hobs are more efficient but less accurate than single-thread hobs. Depending on type of gear teeth to be cut, there are custom made hobs and general purpose hobs. Custom made hobs are different from other hobs as they are suited to make gears with modified tooth profiles. Modified tooth profiles are usually used to add strength and reduce size and gear noise.

== Types ==

Common types of hobs include:

* Roller chain sprocket hobs
* Worm wheel hobs
* Spline hobs
* Chamfer hobs
* Spur and helical gear hobs
* Straight side spline hobs
* Involute spline hobs
* Serration hobs
* Semitopping gear hobs

== Uses ==

Hobbing is used to make the following types of finished gears:

* Cycloid gears
* Helical gears
* Involute gears
* Ratchets
* Splines
* Sprockets
* Spur gears
* Worm gears

Hobbing is used to produce most throated worm wheels, but certain tooth profiles cannot be hobbed. If any portion of the hob profile is perpendicular to the axis, the hob will not have the cutting clearance generated by the usual backing off process and will not cut well.

For cycloidal gears (as used in BS978-2 Specification for fine pitch gears) and cycloidal-type gears, each module, ratio, and number of teeth in the pinion requires a different hobbing cutter, so the hobbing is ineffective for small-volume production. To circumvent this problem, a special war-time emergency circular arc gear standard was produced giving a series of close-to-cycloidal forms which could be cut with a single hob for each module for eight teeth and upwards to economize on cutter manufacturing resources. A variant on this is still included in BS978-2a (Gears for instruments and clockwork mechanisms. Cycloidal type gears. Double circular arc type gears). Tolerances of concentricity of the hob limit the lower modules which can be cut practically by hobbing to about 0.5 module.

<doc id="355129" wikidata="Q41084" url="?curid=355129" title="New Coke">
<text>New Coke was the unofficial name of a reformulation of the soft drink Coca-Cola, introduced by the Coca-Cola Company in April 1985. It was renamed Coke II in 1990, and discontinued in July 2002.

By 1985, Coca-Cola had been losing market share to diet soft drinks and non-cola beverages for several years. Blind taste tests suggested that consumers preferred the sweeter taste of the competing product Pepsi-Cola, and so the Coca-Cola recipe was reformulated. The American public reacted negatively, and New Coke was considered a major failure.

The company reintroduced the original formula within three months, rebranded &quot;Coca-Cola Classic&quot;, resulting in a significant sales boost. This led to speculation that the New Coke formula had been a ploy to stimulate sales of the original Coca-Cola, which the company has vehemently denied. The story of New Coke remains influential as a cautionary tale against tampering with an established successful brand.

==Background==
After World War II, Coca-Cola held 60 percent of the market share for cola. By 1983, it had declined to under 24 percent, largely because of competition from Pepsi-Cola. Pepsi had begun to outsell Coke in supermarkets; Coke maintained its lead only through venues such as soda vending machines and fast food restaurants, 
especially McDonald&#x27;s.

Market analysts believed baby boomers were more likely to purchase diet drinks as they aged and became health- and weight-conscious. Growth in the full-calorie segment would come from younger drinkers, who at that time favored Pepsi by increasing margins. Meanwhile, the overall market for colas steadily declined in the early 1980s, as consumers increasingly purchased diet and non-cola soft drinks, many of which were sold by Coca-Cola. This further eroded Coca-Cola&#x27;s market share. When Roberto Goizueta became Coca-Cola CEO in 1980, he told employees there would be no &quot;sacred cows&quot; in how the company did business, including how it formulated its drinks.

==Development==
Coca-Cola&#x27;s senior executives commissioned a secret project headed by marketing vice president Sergio Zyman and Coca-Cola USA president Brian Dyson to create a new flavor for Coke. This project was named &quot;Project Kansas&quot;, from a photo of Kansas journalist William Allen White drinking a Coke; the image had been used extensively in Coca-Cola advertising and hung on several executives&#x27; walls.

The sweeter cola overwhelmingly beat both regular Coke and Pepsi in taste tests, surveys, and focus groups. The southeastern United States, one of Coca-Cola&#x27;s strongest and most reliable markets, narrowly preferred the new flavor; this preference widened once the testers revealed the new taste was also a Coca-Cola product. One bottling company threatened to sue the company if it did not put the drink on the market.

Asked if they would buy and drink the product if it were Coca-Cola, most testers said they would, although said it would take some getting used to. About 10–12 percent of testers felt angry and alienated at the thought, and said they might stop drinking Coke. Their presence in focus groups tended to negatively skew results as they exerted indirect peer pressure on other participants.

The surveys, which were given more significance by standard marketing procedures of the era, were less negative than the taste tests and were key in convincing management to change the formula in 1985, to coincide with the drink&#x27;s centenary. However, the groups had provided a clue as to how the change would play out in the public, a finding the company downplayed.

Management rejected an idea to make and sell the new flavor as a separate variety of Coca-Cola. The company&#x27;s bottlers were already complaining about absorbing other recent additions into the product line since 1982, after the introduction of Diet Coke; Cherry Coke was launched nationally nearly concurrently with New Coke during 1985. Many bottling companies had sued over the company&#x27;s syrup pricing policies. A new variety of Coke in competition with the main variety could also have cannibalized Coke&#x27;s sales and increased the proportion of Pepsi drinkers relative to Coke drinkers.

Early in his career with Coca-Cola, Goizueta had been in charge of the Bahamas subsidiary. He had improved sales by tweaking the drink&#x27;s flavor slightly, and so was receptive to the idea that changing the flavor of Coke could boost profits. He believed it would be &quot;New Coke or no Coke&quot;, and that the change must take place openly. He insisted that the containers carry the &quot;New!&quot; label, which gave the drink its popular name.

Goizueta also made a visit to his mentor and predecessor as the company&#x27;s chief executive, the ailing Robert W. Woodruff, who had built Coca-Cola into an international brand following World War II. Goizueta claimed he had secured Woodruff&#x27;s blessing for the reformulation, but many of Goizueta&#x27;s closest friends within the company doubted that Woodruff understood Goizueta&#x27;s intentions. Woodruff died in March 1985, a month before New Coke was launched.

==Launch==
New Coke was introduced on April 23, 1985. Production of the original formulation ended later that week. In many areas, New Coke was initially sold in original Coke packaging; bottlers used up remaining cans, cartons and labels before new packaging became widely available. Old cans containing New Coke were identified by their gold colored tops, while glass and plastic bottles had red caps instead of silver or white, respectively. Bright yellow stickers indicating the change were placed on the cartons of multi-packs.

The press conference at New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center to introduce the new formula did not go well. Reporters had already been fed questions by Pepsi, which was worried that New Coke would erase its gains. Goizueta, Coca-Cola&#x27;s CEO, described the new flavor as &quot;bolder&quot;, &quot;rounder&quot;, and &quot;more harmonious&quot;, and defended the change by saying that the drink&#x27;s secret formula was not sacrosanct and inviolable. As far back as 1935, Coca-Cola sought kosher certification from Atlanta rabbi Tobias Geffen, and made two changes to the formula so the drink could be considered kosher (as well as halal and vegetarian). Goizueta also refused to admit that taste tests had led the change, calling it &quot;one of the easiest decisions we&#x27;ve ever made&quot;. When a reporter asked whether Diet Coke would also be reformulated &quot;assuming [New Coke] is a success,&quot; Goizueta curtly replied, &quot;No. And I didn&#x27;t assume that this is a success. This &quot;is&quot; a success.&quot;

The emphasis on the new formula&#x27;s sweeter taste also ran contrary to previous Coke advertising, in which spokesman Bill Cosby had touted the original Coke&#x27;s less-sweet taste as a reason to prefer it over the sweeter taste of Pepsi. The Coca-Cola company&#x27;s stock went up after the announcement, and market research showed 80 percent of the American public was aware of the reformulation within days of the change.

===Initial success===
Coca-Cola introduced the new formula with marketing pushes in New York City, where workers renovating the Statue of Liberty for its centenary in 1986 were given free cans, and Washington, D.C., where thousands of cans were given away in Lafayette Park. As soon as New Coke was introduced, the new formula was available at McDonald&#x27;s and other drink fountains in the United States. Sales figures from those cities, and other areas where it had been introduced such as Miami and Detroit, showed a reaction that went as the market research had predicted. In fact, Coke&#x27;s sales were up 8 percent over the same period as the year before.

Most Coke drinkers resumed buying the new Coke at much the same level as they had the old one. Surveys indicated that the majority of regular Coke drinkers liked the new flavoring. Three quarters of the respondents said they would buy New Coke again. The big test, however, remained in the South, where Coca-Cola had been created and bottled.

===Backlash===

Though New Coke had been accepted by many loyal Coca-Cola drinkers, many more resented the change, as had happened in the focus groups. Many critics were from the southern US states, some of whom considered Coca-Cola part of their regional identity. Some viewed the change through the prism of the Civil War as a surrender to the &quot;Yankees&quot; as PepsiCo, the manufacturer of Pepsi, is based in Purchase, New York.

In a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; story about reaction in the South, a professor at the University of Mississippi observed that &quot;changing Coca-Cola is an intrusion on tradition&quot; and thus would not be well received in that region. An Alabama resident wondered why the company had introduced the new flavor in New York; elsewhere in the state an &quot;Anniston Star&quot; columnist, noting Goizueta&#x27;s Cuban origins, insinuated that the flavor change was a Communist plot. The &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; found a majority of patrons at The Varsity, a popular local restaurant in that city, favored the old formula. &quot;Why didn&#x27;t they test anybody here?&quot; the co-owner asked.

The company received over 40,000 calls and letters expressing anger or disappointment, including one letter, delivered to Goizueta, addressed to &quot;Chief Dodo, the Coca-Cola Company&quot;. Another letter asked for his autograph, as the signature of &quot;one of the dumbest executives in American business history&quot; would likely become valuable in the future. The company hotline, 1-800-GET-COKE, received over 1,500 calls a day compared to around 400 before the change. A psychiatrist whom Coke had hired to listen in on calls told executives that many people sounded as if they were discussing the death of a family member.

There were critics of New Coke from outside the region. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Bob Greene wrote some widely reprinted pieces ridiculing the new flavor and expressing anger at Coke&#x27;s executives for having changed it. Comedians and talk show hosts, including Johnny Carson and David Letterman, made regular jokes mocking the switch. Ads for New Coke were booed heavily when they appeared on the scoreboard at the Houston Astrodome. Even Fidel Castro, a longtime Coca-Cola drinker, contributed to the backlash, calling New Coke a sign of American capitalist decadence. Goizueta&#x27;s father expressed similar misgivings to his son, who later recalled that it was the only time his father had agreed with Castro, whose regime he had fled Cuba to avoid.

Gay Mullins, a Seattle retiree looking to start a public relations firm with $120,000 of borrowed money, formed the Old Cola Drinkers of America on May 28 to lobby Coca-Cola to either reintroduce the old formula or sell it to someone else. His organization eventually received over 60,000 phone calls. He also filed a class action lawsuit against the company (which was quickly dismissed by a judge who said he preferred the taste of Pepsi), while nevertheless expressing interest in securing the Coca-Cola Company as a client of his new firm should it reintroduce the old formula. In two informal blind taste tests, Mullins either failed to distinguish New Coke from old or expressed a preference for New Coke.

Despite ongoing resistance in the South, New Coke continued to do well in the rest of the country. However, the executives were uncertain of how international markets would react. They met with international Coke bottlers in Monaco; to their surprise, the bottlers were not interested in selling New Coke. Zyman also heard doubts and skepticism from his relatives in Mexico, where New Coke was scheduled to be introduced later that summer, when he went there on vacation.

Goizueta stated that Coca-Cola employees who liked New Coke felt unable to speak up due to peer pressure, as had happened in the focus groups. Donald Keough, the Coca-Cola president and chief operating officer at the time, reported overhearing someone say at his country club that they liked New Coke, but they would be &quot;damned if I&#x27;ll let Coca-Cola know that&quot;.

===Response by PepsiCo===
PepsiCo took advantage of the situation, running ads in which a first-time Pepsi drinker exclaimed, &quot;Now I know why Coke did it!&quot; Even amidst consumer anger and several Pepsi ads mocking Coca-Cola&#x27;s debacle, Pepsi actually gained very few long-term converts over Coke&#x27;s switch, despite a 14 percent sales increase over the same month the previous year, the largest sales growth in the company&#x27;s history. Coca-Cola&#x27;s director of corporate communications, Carlton Curtis, realized over time that consumers were more upset about the withdrawal of the old formula than the taste of the new one.

Immediately following the announcement of Coca-Cola&#x27;s change, Roger Enrico, then director of PepsiCo&#x27;s North American operations, took out a full page ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot; proclaiming PepsiCo the winner of the long-running &quot;Cola Wars&quot; and declared a company-wide holiday on April 26, saying &quot;By today&#x27;s action, Coke had admitted that it&#x27;s &quot;not&quot; the real thing.&quot; Since Coke officials were preoccupied over the weekend with preparations for the announcement, their PepsiCo counterparts had time to cultivate skepticism among reporters, sounding themes that would later come into play in the public discourse over the changed drink.

===Company dissatisfaction===
Behind the scenes, some Coca-Cola executives had quietly been arguing for a reintroduction of the old formula as early as May. By mid-June, when soft drink sales usually start to rise, the numbers showed that new Coke was leveling among consumers. Executives feared social peer pressure was now affecting their bottom line. Many consumers even began trying to obtain original Coca-Cola from overseas, where New Coke had not yet been introduced, as domestic stocks of the old drink were exhausted. Due to some complaints about New Coke&#x27;s taste, company chemists quietly reduced the acidity level of the new formula, allowing its sweetness to be better perceived (advertisements pointing to this change were prepared, but never used).

In addition to the noisier public protests, boycotts, and bottles of New Coke being emptied into the streets of several cities, the company had more serious reasons to be concerned. Coca-Cola bottlers, and not just the ones still suing the company over syrup pricing policies, were expressing concern. While they had given Goizueta a standing ovation when he announced the change at an April 22 bottlers&#x27; meeting at Atlanta&#x27;s Woodruff Arts Center, glad the company had finally taken some initiative in the face of PepsiCo&#x27;s advances, they were less enthusiastic about the taste of New Coke. Most of them saw great difficulty in having to promote and sell a drink that had long been marketed as &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, constant and unchanging, now that it had actually been changed.

The 20 bottlers still suing the Coca-Cola company made much of the formula change in their legal arguments. In its defense, the company had argued when the suit was originally filed that the new formula was unique and different from Diet Coke, which justified different pricing policies from the latter; however, if the new formula was merely a high-fructose corn syrup-sweetened version of Diet Coke, the company could not argue the formula for New Coke was unique. Bottlers, particularly in the South, were also tired of facing personal attacks over the change; many reported that some acquaintances and even friends and relatives had actually ostracized them or had expressed their displeasure over New Coke in other emotionally hurtful ways. On June 23, several of the bottlers voiced these complaints in a private meeting with Coca-Cola executives at the company&#x27;s headquarters in Atlanta. With the Coca-Cola company now fearing boycotts not only from consumers but its bottlers, talks about reintroducing the old formula moved from &quot;if&quot; to when.

Finally, the Coca-Cola board decided that enough was enough and in early July, plans were set in motion to resume production of original Coca-Cola. Company president Donald Keough revealed years later, in the documentary &quot;The People vs. Coke&quot; (2002), that they realized this was the only right thing to do when they visited a small restaurant in Monaco and the owner proudly said they served &quot;the real thing, it&#x27;s a real Coke&quot;, offering them a chilled oz. glass bottle of original Coca-Cola.

===Reversal and return===
On the afternoon of July 11, 1985, Coca-Cola executives held a press conference and announced the return of the original Coca-Cola formula, 79 days after New Coke&#x27;s introduction. Peter Jennings of ABC News interrupted &quot;General Hospital&quot; with a special bulletin to share the news with viewers. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, David Pryor called the reintroduction &quot;a meaningful moment in U.S. history&quot;. The company hotline received 31,600 calls in the two days after the announcement.

The new product continued to be marketed and sold as Coke (until 1990, when it was renamed Coke II) while the original formula was named Coca-Cola Classic, and for a short time it was referred to by the public as Old Coke. Some who tasted the reintroduced formula were not convinced that the first batches really were the same formula that had supposedly been retired that spring. This was true for a few regions, because Coca-Cola Classic differed from the original formula in that all bottlers who had not already done so were using high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) instead of cane sugar to sweeten the drink, though most had by this time.

&quot;There is a twist to this story which will please every humanist and will probably keep Harvard professors puzzled for years,&quot; said Keough at a press conference. &quot;The simple fact is that all the time and money and skill poured into consumer research on the new Coca-Cola could not measure or reveal the deep and abiding emotional attachment to original Coca-Cola felt by so many people.&quot;

Gay Mullins, founder of the organization &quot;Old Cola Drinkers of America&quot; (which had lobbied Coca-Cola to either reintroduce the old formula or sell it to someone else), was given the first case of Coca-Cola Classic. Later he complained that the drink now made him sick, which he blamed on the drink&#x27;s use of HFCS; he also claimed that HFCS had dulled his taste buds, accounting for his preference for New Coke in taste tests.

==Aftermath and legacy==
Six months after New Coke&#x27;s introduction, sales of Coke had increased at twice the rate of rival Pepsi. By the end of 1985, Coca-Cola Classic was substantially outselling both New Coke and Pepsi. 

New Coke&#x27;s sales dwindled to a three percent share of the market, although it was selling quite well in Los Angeles and some other key markets. Later research, however, suggested that it was not the return of Coca-Cola Classic, but instead the largely unnoticed introduction of Cherry Coke, which appeared almost simultaneously with New Coke, that can be credited with the company&#x27;s success in 1985.

The Coca-Cola Company spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out where it had made a mistake, ultimately concluding that it had underestimated the public reaction of the portion of the customer base that would be alienated by the switch. This would not emerge for several years afterward, however, and in the meantime the public simply concluded that the company had, as Keough suggested, failed to consider the public&#x27;s attachment to the idea of what Coke&#x27;s old formula represented. While that has become conventional wisdom in the ensuing years, some analyses have suggested otherwise.

This populist version of the story served Coke&#x27;s interests, however, as the episode did more to position and define Coca-Cola as a brand embodying values distinct from Pepsi. Allowing itself to be portrayed as a somewhat clueless large corporation forced to withdraw from a big change by overwhelming public pressure flattered customers, as Keough put it, &quot;We love any retreat which has us rushing toward our best customers with the product they love the most.&quot; Bottles and cans continued to bear the &quot;Coca-Cola Classic&quot; title until January 2009, when the company announced it would stop printing the word &quot;Classic&quot; on the labels of bottles sold in parts of the southeastern United States. The change was part of a larger strategy to rejuvenate the product&#x27;s image.

Bill Cosby ended his long-time advertising for Coca-Cola, claiming that his commercials praising the superiority of the new formula had hurt his credibility. No one at Coca-Cola was fired for the change. When Goizueta died in 1997, the company&#x27;s share price was well above what it was when he had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time, Roger Enrico, then head of PepsiCo&#x27;s American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel. Later, when he became PepsiCo&#x27;s CEO, he modified his assessment of the situation, saying that had people been fired or demoted over New Coke, it would have sent a message that risk-taking was strongly discouraged at the company.

In the late 1990s, Zyman summed up the New Coke experience thus:
New Coke continued to do what it had originally been designed to do: win taste tests. In 1987, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; surveyed 100 randomly selected cola drinkers, the majority of whom indicated a preference for Pepsi, with Classic Coke accounting for the remainder save two New Coke loyalists. When this group was given a chance to try all three in a blind test, New Coke slightly edged out Pepsi, but many drinkers reacted angrily to finding they had chosen a brand other than their favorite.

Goizueta claimed that he never once regretted the decision to change Coca-Cola. He even threw a tenth anniversary party for New Coke in 1995 and continued to drink it until his death in 1997.

===After Coca-Cola Classic===

In the short run, the reintroduction of original Coca-Cola saved Coke&#x27;s sales figures and brought it back in the good graces of many customers and bottlers. Phone calls and letters to the company were as joyful and thankful as they had been angry and depressed. &quot;You would have thought we&#x27;d cured cancer,&quot; said one executive.

But confusion reigned at the company&#x27;s marketing department, which had to design a plan to market two Coca-Colas where such plans were inconceivable just a few months before. Coca-Cola Classic did not need much help, with a &quot;Red, White and You&quot; campaign showcasing the American virtues many of those who had clamored for its reintroduction had pointedly reminded the company that it embodied. But the company was at a loss to sell what was now just &quot;Coke&quot;. &quot;The Best Just Got Better&quot; could no longer be used. Marketers fumbled for a strategy for the rest of the year. Matters were not helped when McDonald&#x27;s announced shortly after the reintroduction of Coca-Cola Classic, that it was immediately switching from New Coke back to original Coca-Cola at all of its restaurants.
 At the beginning of 1986, however, Coke&#x27;s marketing team found a strategy by returning to one of their original motives for changing the formula: the youth market that preferred Pepsi. Max Headroom, the purportedly computer-generated media personality played by Matt Frewer, was chosen to replace Cosby as the spokesman for Coke&#x27;s new &quot;Catch the wave&quot; campaign. With his slicked-back hair and sunglasses, he was already known to much of the U.S. youth audience through appearances on MTV and Cinemax. The campaign was launched with a television commercial produced by McCann Erickson New York, with Max saying in his trademark stutter, &quot;C-c-c-catch the wave!&quot; and referring to his fellow &quot;Cokeologists&quot;. In a riposte to Pepsi&#x27;s televisual teasings, one showed Headroom asking a Pepsi can he was &quot;interviewing&quot; how it felt about more drinkers preferring Coke to it and then cut to the condensation forming on, and running down, the can. &quot;S-s-s-s-sweating?&quot; he asked.

The campaign was a huge success. &quot;Max&#x27;s &#x27;C-C-Catch the wave&#x27; spots for Coke,&quot; a &quot;Newsweek&quot; article said, &quot;two of which were directed by Ridley Scott, may be the most cleverly structured pitches ever aimed at the under-30 viewer.&quot; John Reid, Coke&#x27;s SVP of marketing, claimed that &quot;76 percent of teenagers had heard of Max after our first flight of ads.&quot; Surveys likewise showed that more than three-quarters of the target market were aware of the ads within two days. Coke&#x27;s consumer hotline received more calls about Max than any previous spokesperson, some even asking if he had a girlfriend. The ads and campaign continued through 1987, and were chosen as best of 1986 by Video Storyboard of New York.

===Coke II===
By 1990, the Coca-Cola Company was ready to introduce a radically different marketing campaign for New Coke under the name Coke II, but in only one market – Spokane, Washington, a Pepsi stronghold. The company and bottler put significant resources into the launch of Coke II, including offering 16 oz. cans with 4 oz. free, new &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Your Number&quot; radio and TV ads, and on-air giveaways on KZZU. The new ads tried to explain the taste of Coke II as having &quot;real cola taste plus the sweetness of Pepsi, two things that add up to smooth, refreshing Coke II.&quot; Pepsi struck back with legal challenges to the taste claim, lowered its in-store prices, and ramped up its own advertising. Coke II market share rose to 4% early in the test, but then fell back to 2.3%. The test was not extended past Spokane.

In a market already offering several choices of drinks calling themselves &quot;Coke&quot; in some fashion or another, the public saw little reason to embrace a product they had firmly rejected seven years earlier. By 1998, Coke II could only be found in a few scattered markets in the Northwest, Midwest and some overseas territories. In July 2002, Coca-Cola announced that Coke II would be discontinued entirely.

On August 16, 2002, the Coca-Cola Company announced a change of the label of Coke Classic in which the word &quot;Classic&quot; was no longer so prominent, leading to speculation that it would eventually be removed and the last traces of New Coke eliminated. In 2009, Coca-Cola permanently removed &quot;Classic&quot; from its North American packaging.

===Commercial legacy===
&quot;For a product so widely despised,&quot; noted &quot;AdWeek&quot; blogger Tim Nudd in 2006, &quot;New Coke (a.k.a. Coke II) still gets an admirable amount of ink.&quot; He noted &quot;Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking&quot; (2005) by Malcolm Gladwell, and &quot;Why Most Things Fail: Evolution, Extinction and Economics&quot; (2005) by Paul Ormerod, that dealt with it at some length, as well as two recent mentions in &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

Within Coca-Cola, the role the company&#x27;s bottlers had played in forcing its hand led executives to create a new subsidiary, Coca-Cola Enterprises, which bought out several of the larger bottlers and placed distribution and marketing efforts more tightly under Coca-Cola&#x27;s control.

===Conspiracy theories===
The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s apparently sudden reversal on New Coke led to conspiracy theories, including:

* The company intentionally changed the formula, hoping consumers would be upset with the company, and demand the original formula to return, which in turn would cause sales to spike. Keough, the company president, answered this speculation by saying &quot;We&#x27;re not that dumb, and we&#x27;re not that smart.&quot;
* The putative switch was planned all along to cover the change from sugar-sweetened Coke to much less expensive high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a theory that was supposedly given credence by the apparently different taste of Coke Classic when it first hit the market (the U.S. sugar trade association took out a full-page ad lambasting Coke for using HFCS in all bottling of the old formula when it was reintroduced). In fact, Coca-Cola began allowing bottlers to remove up to half of the product&#x27;s cane sugar as early as 1980, five years before the introduction of New Coke. By the time the new formula was introduced, most bottlers in the U.S. had already sweetened Coca-Cola entirely with HFCS.
* It provided cover for the final removal of all coca derivatives from the product to placate the Drug Enforcement Administration, which was trying to eradicate the plant worldwide to combat an increase in cocaine trafficking and consumption. While Coke&#x27;s executives were indeed relieved the new formula contained no coca and concerned about the long-term future of the Peruvian government-owned coca fields that supplied it in the face of increasing DEA pressure to end cultivation of the crop, according to author Mark Pendergrast there was no direct pressure from the DEA on Coca-Cola to do so. This theory was endorsed in a &quot;Time&quot; article, as well as by historian Bartow Elmore, author of &quot;Citizen Coke: The Making of Coca-Cola Capitalism&quot;, who claims the reformulation was made in response to the escalating War on Drugs by the Reagan Administration.

===Taste test problems===
In his book &quot;&quot; (2005), Malcolm Gladwell relates his conversations with market researchers in the food industry who put most of the blame for the failure of New Coke on the flawed nature of taste tests. They claim most are subject to systematic biases. Tests such as the Pepsi Challenge were &quot;sip tests&quot;, meaning that drinkers were given small samples (less than a can or bottle&#x27;s worth) to try. Gladwell contends that what people say they like in these tests may not reflect what they actually buy to drink at home over several days. Carol Dollard, who once worked in product development for PepsiCo, told Gladwell: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen many times where the sip test will give you one result and the home-use test will give you the exact opposite.&quot; For example, although many consumers react positively to the sweeter taste of Pepsi in small volumes, it may become unattractively sweet when drunk in quantity. A more comprehensive testing regimen could possibly have revealed this, Gladwell&#x27;s sources believe.

Gladwell reports that other market researchers have criticized Coke for not realizing that much of its success as a brand came from what they call sensation transference, a phenomenon first described by marketer Louis Cheskin in the late 1940s: tasters unconsciously add their reactions to the drink&#x27;s packaging into their assessment of the taste. For example, one of the researchers told Gladwell that his firm&#x27;s research found 7-Up drinkers believed a sample from a bottle with a more yellow label was more &quot;lemony&quot;, although the flavor was identical. In Coke&#x27;s case, it is alleged that buyers, subject to sensation transference, were also &quot;tasting&quot; the red color of the container and distinctive Coca-Cola script. It was therefore, in their opinion, a mistake to focus solely on the product and its taste. &quot;The mistake Coke made was in attributing their loss in share entirely to the product.&quot; said Darrel Rhea, an executive with the firm Cheskin founded. He points to PepsiCo&#x27;s work in establishing a youth-oriented brand identity from the 1960s as having more bearing on its success.

Coke considered but rejected gradually changing the drink&#x27;s flavor incrementally, without announcing they were doing so. Executives feared the public would notice and exaggerate slight differences in taste. In 1998, Joel Dubow, a professor of food marketing at St. Joseph&#x27;s University, tested this &quot;flavor balance hypothesis&quot; and argued that it was not true. He and fellow researcher Nancy Childs tested mixtures of Coca-Cola Classic and Coke II and found that the gradual changes of taste were not noticed by a significant number of tasters. Coke, he said, would have succeeded had it chosen this strategy.

==2019 reintroduction==
On May 21, 2019, Coca-Cola announced that the 1985 reformulation (once again bearing the name &quot;New Coke&quot;) would be reintroduced in limited quantities to promote the third season of the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. The show, set in 1985, included cans of New Coke in three of the season&#x27;s episodes.

About 500,000 cans of New Coke were produced for the promotion, to be sold mostly online. So many people were eager to buy it, however, that the volume of orders crashed the Coca-Cola website. Many fans complained because they wanted to order some, and the company apologized for the delays on social media platforms. It was also available in select vending machines in cities such as New York and Los Angeles.

The reintroduction of New Coke received friendlier reviews than it had in 1985. A writer at &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; said it was &quot;nice and refreshing&quot;, lacking the lingering aftertaste of classic Coca-Cola. &quot;I would take this over other colas,&quot; said a colleague. &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot; staffers also had favorable impressions: &quot;sweeter and smoother than regular Coke&quot;, &quot;almost syrupy in a pleasant way&quot;, although an older member who recalled the original rollout in 1985 said it had not improved for them.

Tim Murphy, a reporter for the progressive magazine &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, suggested that, in ultimately overcoming an initial resistance that he saw as reactionary, New Coke had won the war after losing the battle. &quot;Soft-drink trends have also proven Coke right about a willingness to adapt to new tastes: A majority of Coke sales today are non-Classic products, such as Diet and Coke Zero,&quot; he wrote. This explained the favorable response from tasters. &quot;It tasted weird then; it tastes like what&#x27;s normal now.&quot;

<doc id="355132" wikidata="Q64554" url="?curid=355132" title="Tecun Uman">
<text>Tecun Uman (1500? – February 20, 1524) was one of the last rulers of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya people, in the Highlands of what is now Guatemala. According to the Kaqchikel annals, he was slain by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado while waging battle against the Spanish and their allies on the approach to Quetzaltenango on 12 February 1524. Tecun Uman was declared Guatemala&#x27;s official national hero on March 22, 1960, and is commemorated on February 20, the popular anniversary of his death. Tecun Uman has inspired a wide variety of activities ranging from the production of statues and poetry to the retelling of the legend in the form of folkloric dances to prayers. Despite this, Tecun Uman&#x27;s existence is not well documented, and it has proven to be difficult to separate the man from the legend.

==Battle of El Pinar==

In 1522 Hernán Cortés sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met delegations from Iximche and Q&#x27;umarkaj at Tuxpán; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the king of Spain. But Cortés&#x27; allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K&#x27;iche&#x27; and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were instead harassing Spain&#x27;s allies in the region. Cortés decided to despatch Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, crossbows, muskets, 4 cannons, large amounts of ammunition and gunpowder, and thousands of allied Mexican warriors from Tlaxcala, Cholula and other cities in central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.
Pedro de Alvarado and his army advanced along the Pacific coast unopposed until they reached the Samalá River in western Guatemala. This region formed a part of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; kingdom, and a K&#x27;iche&#x27; army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river. Once across, the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements in an effort to terrorise the K&#x27;iche&#x27;. On 8 February 1524 Alvarado&#x27;s army fought a battle at Xetulul, called Zapotitlán by his Mexican allies (modern San Francisco Zapotitlán). Although suffering many injuries inflicted by defending K&#x27;iche&#x27; archers, the Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace. Alvarado then turned to head upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the K&#x27;iche&#x27; heartlands, crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado&#x27;s Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K&#x27;iche&#x27; warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the K&#x27;iche&#x27;, who had never before seen horses. The cavalry scattered the K&#x27;iche&#x27; and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju (modern Quetzaltenango) only to find it deserted. Although the common view is that the K&#x27;iche&#x27; prince Tecun Uman died in the later battle near Olintepeque, the Spanish accounts are clear that at least one and possibly two of the lords of Q&#x27;umarkaj died in the fierce battles upon the initial approach to Quetzaltenango. The death of Tecun Uman is said to have taken place in the battle of El Pinar, and local tradition has his death taking place on the Llanos de Urbina (Plains of Urbina), upon the approach to Quetzaltenango near the modern village of Cantel. Pedro de Alvarado, in his third letter to Hernán Cortés, describes the death of one of the four lords of Q&#x27;umarkaj upon the approach to Quetzaltenango. The letter was dated 11 April 1524 and was written during his stay at Q&#x27;umarkaj.

===The legend===
The legends relate that Tecun Uman entered battle adorned with precious quetzal feathers, and that his nahual (animal spirit guide), also a quetzal bird, accompanied him during the battle. In the midst of the battle, Alvarado and Tecun Uman met face to face, each with weapon in hand. Alvarado was clad in armor and mounted on his warhorse. As horses were not native to the Americas and peoples of Mesoamerica had no beasts of burden of their own, Tecun Uman assumed they were one being and killed Alvarado&#x27;s horse. Another version says he merely attacked the horse in an attempt to knock Alvarado down, having no prior illusion that both man and animal to be one and the same. Tecun Uman quickly realized his error and turned for a second attack but Alvarado&#x27;s thrust his spear into his opponent&#x27;s heart. The K&#x27;iche&#x27; prince&#x27;s nahual, filled with grief, landed on the fallen hero&#x27;s chest, staining its breast feathers red with blood, and thereafter died. From that day on, all male quetzals bear a scarlet breast and their song has not been heard since. Further, if one is to be placed in captivity, it would die, making the quetzal a symbol of liberty.

Another account claims a much more complex confrontation of religious and material forces. In this version Tecun Uman himself literally transformed into a quetzal or, in some variations, into an eagle adorned with three crowns - one of gold, one of diamonds and one of emeralds. Other natives had attempted to kill Alvarado, but he was protected by a powerful maiden, commonly associated with the Virgin Mary. Tecun Uman called upon his own magic, and in the intention of killing Alvarado, struck Alvarado&#x27;s horse dead. Upon learning he had killed only the beast and not the man, he had attempted to correct his mistake, but was quickly impaled by Alvarado&#x27;s spear.

A different version states Tecun Uman had an opportunity to kill Alvarado but ultimately failed and was slain by one of Alvarado&#x27;s subordinates, a soldier known by the name of Argueta.

Local folklore from the area around the former K&#x27;iche&#x27; capital of Q&#x27;umarkaj preserves the belief that he was buried at the small archaeological site of Atalaya, from Q&#x27;umarkaj itself.

==Historical evidence==
The true existence of a historical Tecun Uman is subject of ongoing debate. One piece of evidence to suggest he lived comes from a letter written by Alvarado to Hernán Cortés. However, the letter is quite sparing in details, with Alvarado only mentioning of the battle that ensued: &quot;in this affair one of the four chiefs of the city of Utatlán was killed, who was the captain general of all this country.&quot; Alvarado did not provide a name for the K&#x27;iche&#x27; general; nor did he mention how or by whose hand the man was killed. Several other indigenous documents describe the arrival of Alvarado in what would become Guatemala, including the &quot;Título C&#x27;oyoi&quot; which describes the battle in terms similar to the modern legend. This document also contains the earliest known reference to the K&#x27;iche&#x27; leader as &quot;Tecum Umam&quot;.

The Popol Vuh confirms the observations of Bartolomé de las Casas and the Título de Totonicapán, which record that four lords ruled the K&#x27;iche&#x27; at the time of the Spanish conquest. The first-born son of the Keeper of the Mat (the most powerful of the lords) was expected to prove himself by leading the K&#x27;iche&#x27; army and was given the title &quot;nima rajpop achij&quot;, the same title given to Tecun Uman in the Título K&#x27;oyoi. This is all tied together by the genealogy of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; lords that is given near the end of the Popul Vuh and a section of the Título de Totonicapan, which both refer to the son of the Keeper of the Mat as &quot;Tecum&quot; at the time of Alvarado&#x27;s arrival.

A second explanation for the absence of greater detail in Alvarado&#x27;s letter is that Tecun Uman actually did battle with one of Alvarado&#x27;s subordinates, by the name of Argueta. This suggestion is based on the claim of Argueta&#x27;s descendants that the lance they keep as an heirloom of their predecessor is stained with the blood of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; hero.

===Name===
It is believed that &quot;Tecun Uman&quot; was more than likely not the ruler&#x27;s name at all but may have functioned as a sort of title. The earliest recorded appearance of the name is in the &quot;Título C&#x27;oyoi&quot; in which he is referred to as &quot;nima rajpop achij adelantado Tecum umam rey k&#x27;iche&#x27; don k&#x27;iq&#x27;ab&#x27;.&quot; Translated, this phrase means: &quot;great captain-general Tecum, grandson of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; king Don K&#x27;iqab&#x27;.&quot; Therefore, the word &quot;uman&quot; or &quot;umam&quot; simply means &quot;grandson of&quot; and is not part of Tecun&#x27;s name at all. It has been suggested that &quot;umam&quot; may have been a reference to his genealogy, or the name may have originally been derived from another title given to the hero, &quot;q&#x27;uq&#x27;umam&quot;, meaning &quot;ancient one of quetzal feathers&quot;, or it might have come from the indigenous name for a prominent local volcano: &quot;Teyocuman.&quot;

===Baile de la Conquista===
The Guatemalan Baile de la Conquista (&quot;&quot;Dance of the Conquest&quot;) is a traditional dance borrowing its structure from the Spanish Baile de los Moros (&quot;Dance of the Moors&quot;&quot;), which commemorates the expulsion of the Moors from Spain. The dance is known to have been performed throughout certain regions of colonial Latin America during a time when Catholic priests encouraged its use to aid them in the conversion of various native populations.

In Guatemala, the dance recounts the early events of the conquest, centering on the confrontation between Tecun Uman and Pedro de Alvarado, which in turn serves as a symbol for the much larger conflict in which they were involved. The dance reenacts the invasion led by Alvarado and the conquest of Guatemala. To fit the traditions of the Baile de los Moros, the role of the Moorish prince is replaced with that of Tecun Uman. It has therefore been suggested that the structure of the dance forced them to create a leader for the native armies, with Tecun Uman created specifically for that purpose. This theory is generally given little credence, in light of the observation that such documents as the Título K&#x27;oyoi appeared long before the first performances of the Baile de la Conquista.

==National Hero==
Tecun Uman was declared a National Hero of Guatemala on March 22, 1960, and is celebrated annually on February 20 for the bravery and dignity he demonstrated in opposition to the Spanish Conquistadors. Tecun Uman&#x27;s namesakes include a small town in the department of San Marcos on the Guatemala-Mexico border as well as countless hotels, restaurants, and Spanish schools throughout Guatemala. He is also memorialized in a poem by Miguel Ángel Asturias that bears his name. In contrast to his popularity, he is at times rejected by Maya cultural activists who consider his status as a national hero a source of irony, considering the long history of mistreatment of Guatemala&#x27;s native population.

<text>The Polish People&#x27;s Republic (1952–1989), formerly the Republic of Poland (1947–1952), and also often simply known as Poland, was a country in Central Europe that existed as the predecessor of the modern-day democratic Republic of Poland. With a population of approximately 37.9 million near the end of its existence, it was the second most-populous communist and Eastern Bloc country in Europe, and one of the main signatories of the Warsaw Pact alliance. The largest city and official capital since 1947 was Warsaw, followed by the industrial city of Łódź and cultural city of Kraków. The country was bordered by the Baltic Sea to the north, the Soviet Union to the east, Czechoslovakia to the south, and East Germany to the west.

The Polish People&#x27;s Republic was a unitary state with a Marxist–Leninist government established in the country after the Red Army&#x27;s takeover of Polish territory from German occupation in World War II. Communist control was strengthened through electoral fraud in the 1946 Polish people&#x27;s referendum and the 1947 Polish parliamentary election. The Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR) became the dominant political faction in a one-party state but the country had more liberal policies than other socialist states due to its strategic location in the Cold War and internal opposition. The state&#x27;s official name was the &quot;Republic of Poland&quot; (&quot;&quot;) between 1947 and 1952 in accordance with the temporary Small Constitution of 1947. The name &quot;People&#x27;s Republic&quot; was introduced and defined by the Constitution of 1952. The Polish People&#x27;s Republic was dissolved following the Revolutions of 1989 and the 1990 Polish presidential election, but the post-communist Third Polish Republic retained the 1952 constitution, with amendments, until the introduction of the current constitution on 17 October 1997, abolishing the socialist structure entirely and replacing with a parliamentary system that has remained in place to the present-day.

The Ministry of Public Security (UB) and later the Security Service (SB) were the chief intelligence agencies that acted as the secret police. The official police organization, Milicja Obywatelska (MO), along with its ZOMO squads, conducted mass surveillance and violent suppression of protests. The various crimes committed to maintain the PZPR in power, especially after the Cold War intensified, included the harsh treatment of protesters, arrest of opposition leaders and in extreme cases, executions, with an estimated 22,000 people killed or disappeared from 1947 to 1989. Despite the numerous economic hardships, some achievements were established during this period, including improved living conditions, rapid industrialization, and urbanization. Access to universal health care and free education were made available, and the population almost doubled between 1947 and 1989. Poland also maintained a large standing army, known as the Polish People&#x27;s Army. In addition, units of the Soviet Armed Forces were also stationed in Poland as in all other Warsaw Pact countries.

==History==
===1945–1956===
In the summer of 1944, the Polish Committee of National Liberation was established by Soviet-backed Polish communists to control territory retaken from Nazi Germany. On 1 January 1945 the committee was replaced by the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, all the key posts of which were held by members of the communist Polish Workers&#x27; Party.

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Stalin was able to present his Western allies, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, with a &quot;fait accompli&quot; in Poland. His armed forces were in occupation of the country, and the communists were in control of its administration. The Soviet Union was in the process of reincorporating the lands to the east of the Curzon Line, which it had invaded and occupied between 1939 and 1941.

In compensation, Poland was granted German-populated territories in Pomerania, Silesia, and Brandenburg east of the Oder–Neisse line, including the southern half of East Prussia. As a result of these actions, Poland lost 77,035 km2 (29,743 sq mi) of land compared to its pre-WWII territory. These were confirmed, pending a final peace conference with Germany, at the Tripartite Conference of Berlin, otherwise known as the Potsdam Conference in August 1945 after the end of the war in Europe. The Potsdam Agreement also sanctioned the transfer of the German population out of the acquired territories. Stalin was determined that Poland&#x27;s new communist government would become his tool towards making Poland a satellite state like other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. He had severed relations with the Polish government-in-exile in London in 1943, but to appease Roosevelt and Churchill he agreed at Yalta that a coalition government would be formed. The Provisional Government of National Unity was established in June 1946 with the communists holding a majority of key posts, and with Soviet support they soon gained almost total control of the country.

In June 1946, the &quot;Three Times Yes&quot; referendum was held on a number of issues—abolition of the Senate of Poland, land reform, and making the Oder–Neisse line Poland&#x27;s western border. The communist-controlled Interior Ministry issued results showing that all three questions passed overwhelmingly. Years later, however, evidence was uncovered showing that the referendum had been tainted by large-scale fraud, and only the third question actually passed. Władysław Gomułka then took advantage of a split in the Polish Socialist Party. One faction, which included Prime Minister Edward Osóbka-Morawski, wanted to join forces with the Peasant Party and form a united front against the communists. Another faction, led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, argued that the socialists should support the communists in carrying through a socialist program while opposing the imposition of one-party rule. Pre-war political hostilities continued to influence events, and Stanisław Mikołajczyk would not agree to form a united front with the socialists. The communists played on these divisions by dismissing Osóbka-Morawski and making Cyrankiewicz Prime Minister.

Between the referendum and the January 1947 general elections, the opposition was subjected to persecution. Only the candidates of the pro-government &quot;Democratic Bloc&quot; (the PPR, Cyrankiewicz&#x27; faction of the PPS, and the Democratic Party) were allowed to campaign completely unmolested. Meanwhile, several opposition candidates were prevented from campaigning at all. Mikołajczyk&#x27;s Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL) in particular suffered persecution; it had opposed the abolition of the Senate as a test of strength against the government. Although it supported the other two questions, the Communist-dominated government branded the PSL &quot;traitors&quot;. This massive oppression was overseen by Gomułka and the provisional president, Bolesław Bierut.

The official results of the election showed the Democratic Bloc with 80.1 percent of the vote. The Democratic Bloc was awarded 394 seats to only 28 for the PSL. Mikołajczyk immediately resigned to protest this so-called &#x27;implausible result&#x27; and fled to the United Kingdom in April rather than face arrest. Later, some historians announced that the official results were only obtained through massive fraud. Government officials didn&#x27;t even count the real votes in many areas and simply filled in the relevant documents in accordance with instructions from the communists. In other areas, the ballot boxes were either destroyed or replaced with boxes containing prefilled ballots.

The 1947 election marked the beginning of undisguised communist rule in Poland, though it was not officially transformed into the Polish People&#x27;s Republic until the adoption of the 1952 Constitution. However, Gomułka never supported Stalin&#x27;s control over the Polish communists and was soon replaced as party leader by the more pliable Bierut. In 1948, the communists consolidated their power, merging with Cyrankiewicz&#x27; faction of the PPS to form the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (known in Poland as &#x27;the Party&#x27;), which would monopolise political power in Poland until 1989. In 1949, Polish-born Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky became the Minister of National Defence, with the additional title Marshal of Poland, and in 1952 he became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers (deputy premier).
Over the coming years, private industry was nationalised, the land seized from the pre-war landowners and redistributed to the lower-class farmers, and millions of Poles were transferred from the lost eastern territories to the lands acquired from Germany. Poland was now to be brought into line with the Soviet model of a &quot;people&#x27;s democracy&quot; and a centrally planned socialist economy. The government also embarked on the collectivisation of agriculture, although the pace was slower than in other satellites: Poland remained the only Eastern Bloc country where individual farmers dominated agriculture.

Through a careful balance of agreement, compromise and resistance — and having signed an agreement of coexistence with the communist government — cardinal primate Stefan Wyszyński maintained and even strengthened the Polish church through a series of failed government leaders. He was put under house arrest from 1953 to 1956 for failing to punish priests who participated in anti-government activity.

Bierut died in March 1956 and was replaced with Edward Ochab, who held the position for seven months. In June, workers in the industrial city of Poznań went on strike, in what became known as 1956 Poznań protests. Voices began to be raised in the Party and among the intellectuals calling for wider reforms of the Stalinist system. Eventually, power shifted towards Gomułka, who replaced Ochab as party leader. Hardline Stalinists were removed from power and many Soviet officers serving in the Polish Army were dismissed. This marked the end of the Stalinist era.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===

In 1970, Gomułka&#x27;s government decided to adopt massive increases in the prices of basic goods, including food. The resulting widespread violent protests in December the same year resulted in a number of deaths. They also forced another major change in the government, as Gomułka was replaced by Edward Gierek as the new First Secretary. Gierek&#x27;s plan for recovery was centered on massive borrowing, mainly from the United States and West Germany, to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers some incentive to work. While it boosted the Polish economy, and is still remembered as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of socialist Poland, it left the country vulnerable to global economic fluctuations and Western undermining, and the repercussions in the form of massive debt are still felt in Poland even today. This Golden Age came to an end after the 1973 energy crisis. The failure of the Gierek government, both economically and politically, soon led to the creation of opposition in the form of trade unions, student groups, clandestine newspapers and publishers, imported books and newspapers, and even a &quot;flying university&quot;.

On 16 October 1978, the Archbishop of Kraków, Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, was elected Pope, taking the name John Paul II. The election of a Polish Pope had an electrifying effect on what had been, even under communist rule, one of the most devoutly Catholic nations in Europe. Gierek is alleged to have said to his cabinet, &quot;O God, what are we going to do now?&quot; or, as occasionally reported, &quot;Jesus and Mary, this is the end&quot;. When John Paul II made his first papal tour of Poland in June 1979, half a million people heard him speak in Warsaw; he did not call for rebellion, but instead encouraged the creation of an &quot;alternative Poland&quot; of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next economic crisis came, the nation would present a united front.
A new wave of labour strikes undermined Gierek&#x27;s government, and in September Gierek, who was in poor health, was finally removed from office and replaced as Party leader by Stanisław Kania. However, Kania was unable to find an answer for the fast-eroding support of communism in Poland. Labour turmoil led to the formation of the independent trade union Solidarity (&quot;Solidarność&quot;) in September 1980, originally led by Lech Wałęsa. In fact, Solidarity became a broad anti-communist social movement ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to members of the anti-Stalinist left. By the end of 1981, Solidarity had nine million members—a quarter of Poland&#x27;s population and three times as many as the PUWP had. Kania resigned under Soviet pressure in October and was succeeded by Wojciech Jaruzelski, who had been Defence minister since 1968 and Premier since February.

On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski proclaimed martial law, suspended Solidarity, and temporarily imprisoned most of its leaders. This sudden crackdown on Solidarity was reportedly out of fear of Soviet intervention (see Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–1981). The government then disallowed Solidarity on 8 October 1982. Martial law was formally lifted in July 1983, though many heightened controls on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place through the mid-to-late-1980s. Jaruzelski stepped down as prime minister in 1985 and became president (chairman of the Council of State).


This did not prevent Solidarity from gaining more support and power. Eventually, it eroded the dominance of the PUWP, which in 1981 lost approximately 85,000 of its 3 million members. Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persisted solely as an underground organization, but by the late 1980s was sufficiently strong to frustrate Jaruzelski&#x27;s attempts at reform, and nationwide strikes in 1988 were one of the factors that forced the government to open a dialogue with Solidarity.

From 6 February to 15 April 1989, talks of 13 working groups in 94 sessions, which became known as the &quot;Roundtable Talks&quot; (&quot;Rozmowy Okrągłego Stołu&quot;) saw the PUWP abandon power and radically altered the shape of the country. In June, shortly after the Tiananmen Square protests in China, the 1989 Polish legislative election took place. Much to its own surprise, Solidarity took all contested (35%) seats in the Sejm, the Parliament&#x27;s lower house, and all but one seat in the elected Senate.

Solidarity persuaded the communists&#x27; longtime allied parties, the United People&#x27;s Party and Democratic Party, to switch their support to Solidarity. This all but forced Jaruzelski, who had been named president in July, to appoint a Solidarity member as prime minister. Finally, he appointed a Solidarity-led coalition government with Tadeusz Mazowiecki as the country&#x27;s first non-communist prime minister since 1948.

On 10 December 1989, the statue of Vladimir Lenin was removed in Warsaw by the Polish authorities.

The Parliament amended the Constitution on 29 December 1989 to formally rescind the PUWP&#x27;s constitutionally-guaranteed power and restore democracy and civil liberties. This began the Third Polish Republic, and served as a prelude to the democratic elections of 1991 — the first since 1928.

The PZPR was disbanded on 30 January 1990, and Wałęsa was elected as president eleven months later. The Warsaw Pact was dissolved on 1 July 1991 and the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991. On 27 October 1991, the 1991 Polish parliamentary election, the first democratic election since the 1920s. This completed Poland&#x27;s transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style liberal democratic political system. The last post-Soviet troops left Poland on 18 September 1993. After ten years of democratic consolidation, Poland joined OECD in 1996, NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.

== Government and politics ==
The government and politics of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic were dominated by the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza, PZPR&quot;). Despite the presence of two minor parties, the United People&#x27;s Party and the Democratic Party, the country was a one-party state because these two parties were completely subservient to the Communists and had to accept the PZPR&#x27;s &quot;leading role&quot; as a condition of their existence. It was politically influenced by the Soviet Union to the extent of being its satellite country, along with East Germany, Czechoslovakia and other Eastern Bloc members.

From 1952, the highest law was the Constitution of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, and the Polish Council of State replaced the presidency of Poland. Elections were held on the single lists of the Front of National Unity. Despite these changes, Poland was one of the most liberal communist nations and was the only communist country in the world which did not have any communist symbols (red star, stars, ears of wheat, or hammer and sickle) on its flag and coat of arms. The White Eagle founded by Polish monarchs in the Middle Ages remained as Poland&#x27;s national emblem; the only feature removed by the communists from the pre-war design was the crown, which was seen as imperialistic and monarchist.

The Polish People&#x27;s Republic maintained a large standing army and hosted Soviet troops in its territory, as Poland was a Warsaw Pact signatory. The UB and succeeding SB were the chief intelligence agencies that acted as secret police. The official police organization, which was also responsible for peacekeeping and suppression of protests, was renamed Milicja Obywatelska. The Milicja&#x27;s elite ZOMO squads committed various serious crimes to maintain the communists in power, including the harsh treatment of protesters, arrest of opposition leaders and in some cases, murder. According to Rudolph J. Rummel, at least 22,000 people were killed by the regime during its rule. As a result, Poland had a high imprisonment rate but one of the lowest crime rates in the world.

=== Foreign relations ===
In foreign relations, the Polish People&#x27;s Republic had a particularly close relationship with the Soviet Union and was within Moscow&#x27;s circle of influence. However, during its existence, the Polish People&#x27;s Republic maintained close relations not only with the Soviet Union, but other communist states in the Eastern Bloc. It also had friendly relations with the United States, United Kingdom, France, and the Western Bloc as well as the People&#x27;s Republic of China. At the height of the Cold War, Poland attempted to remain neutral to the conflict between the Soviets and the Americans. In particular, Edward Gierek sought to establish Poland as a mediator between the two powers in the 1970s. Both the U.S. presidents and the Soviet general secretaries or leaders visited communist Poland.

Poland was hostile to the Republic of China, which had retreated to Taiwan following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and was viewed as an illegitimate state by Poland&#x27;s government. The seizure of the cargo ships &quot;Praca&quot; and &quot;Prezydent Gottwald&quot; in 1953 and 1954, respectively, particularly inflamed tensions between the two countries.

Under pressure from the Soviet Union, Poland participated in the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.

The Polish People&#x27;s Republic&#x27;s relations with Israel were on a fair level in the aftermath of the Holocaust. In 1947, Poland voted in favour of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which led to Israel&#x27;s recognition by Poland on 19 May 1948. However, by the Six-Day War, it severed diplomatic relations with Israel in June 1967 and supported the Palestine Liberation Organization which recognized the State of Palestine on 14 December 1988. In 1989, Poland restored relations with Israel.

The Polish People&#x27;s Republic participated as a member of the United Nations (as a founding member), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Warsaw Pact, Comecon, the International Energy Agency, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the International Atomic Energy Agency and Interkosmos.

== Economy ==
=== Early years ===

Poland suffered tremendous economic losses during World War II. In 1939, Poland had 35.1 million inhabitants, but the census of 14 February 1946 showed only 23.9 million inhabitants. The difference was partially the result of the border revision. Losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to approximately 38%. The implementation of the immense tasks involved with the reconstruction of the country was intertwined with the struggle of the new government for the stabilisation of power, made even more difficult by the fact that a considerable part of society was mistrustful of the communist government. The occupation of Poland by the Red Army and the support the Soviet Union had shown for the Polish communists was decisive in the communists gaining the upper hand in the new Polish government.

As control of the Polish territories passed from occupying forces of Nazi Germany to the subsequent occupying forces of the Soviet Union, and from the Soviet Union to the Soviet-imposed puppet satellite government, Poland&#x27;s new economic system was forcibly imposed and began moving towards a radical, communist centrally planned economy. One of the first major steps in that direction involved the agricultural reform issued by the Polish Committee of National Liberation government on 6 September 1944. All estates over 0.5 km2 in pre-war Polish territories and all over 1 km2 in former German territories were nationalised without compensation. In total, 31,000 km2 of land were nationalised in Poland and 5 million in the former German territories, out of which 12,000 km2 were redistributed to farmers and the rest remained in the hands of the government (Most of this was eventually used in the collectivization and creation of sovkhoz-like State Agricultural Farms &quot;PGR&quot;). However, the collectivization of Polish farming never reached the same extent as it did in the Soviet Union or other countries of the Eastern Bloc.

Nationalisation began in 1944, with the pro-Soviet government taking over industries in the newly acquired territories along with the rest of the country. As nationalization was unpopular, the communists delayed the nationalization reform until 1946, when after the 3xTAK referendums they were fairly certain they had total control of the state and could deal a heavy blow to eventual public protests. Some semi-official nationalisation of various private enterprises had begun also in 1944. In 1946, all enterprises with over 50 employees were nationalised, with no compensation to Polish owners.

The Allied punishment of Germany for the war of destruction included Polish administration over the bulk of the former German East. These lands proved to be essential for the Polish Communists, because the former German industries and farms immediately passed to state control. In fact, the former German industrial facilities doubled Poland&#x27;s industrial base. Economic arguments had been an essential point in the arguments presented by the Polish delegation at the Potsdam Conferencec.

There is a consensus that the German eastern provinces gained by Poland were economically better developed than the lost Kresy. A recent proposal for a macroeconomic calculation of the economic consequences of the westward Shift of Poland obtained, that the German eastern provinces were valued 25,8 billion International Dollars, while the whole of the Kresy was valued 9,4 billion International Dollars.

Additionally, Germany was intended to transfer large-scale reparations to Poland. However, those were truncated into insignificance by the break-up of Germany into East (former Central Germany) and West and the onset of the Cold War. Poland was then relegated to receive her share from the Soviet-controlled East Germany. However, even this was attenuated, as the Soviets pressured the Polish Government to cease receiving the reparations far ahead of schedule as a sign of &#x27;friendship&#x27; between the two new communist neighbors and, therefore, now friends. Thus, without the reparations and without the massive Marshall Plan implemented in the West at that time, Poland&#x27;s postwar recovery was much harder than it could have been.

=== Later years ===

During the Gierek era, Poland borrowed large sums from Western creditors in exchange for the promise of social and economic reforms. None of these were delivered due to resistance from the hardline communist leadership as it would effectively require abandoning the Marxian economy with central planning, state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices and trade. After the West refused to grant Poland further loans, the living standards began to fall sharply again as the supply of imported goods dried up, and as Poland was forced to export everything it could, particularly food and coal, to service its massive debt, which would reach US$23 billion by 1980.

In 1981, Poland notified Club de Paris (a group of Western-European central banks) of its insolvency, and a series of negotiations on the repayment of its foreign debt was completed between 1989 and 1991.

The party was forced to raise prices, which led to further large-scale social unrest and the formation of the Solidarity movement. During the Solidarity years and the imposition of martial law, Poland entered a decade of economic crisis, officially acknowledged as such even by the regime. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (&quot;Kartki&quot;) necessary to buy even such basic consumer staples as milk and sugar. Access to Western luxury goods became even more restricted, as Western governments applied economic sanctions to express their dissatisfaction with the government repression of the opposition, while at the same time, the government had to use most of the foreign currency it could obtain to pay the crushing rates on its foreign debt.

In response to this situation, the government, which controlled all official foreign trade, continued to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market and the development of a shortage economy. The only way for an individual to buy most Western goods was to use Western currencies, notably the U.S. dollar, which in effect became a parallel currency. However, it could not simply be exchanged at the official banks for zlotys, since the government exchange rate undervalued the dollar and placed heavy restrictions on the amount that could be exchanged, and so the only practical way to obtain it was from remittances or work outside the country. An entire illegal industry of street-corner money changers emerged as a result. These so-called &quot;Cinkciarze&quot; gave clients an exchange rate far better than the official one and became wealthy from their opportunism albeit at the risk of punishment, usually diminished by the wide-scale bribery of the Milicja.

As Western currency came into the country from emigrant families and foreign workers, the government in turn attempted to gather it up by various means, most visibly by establishing a chain of state-run &quot;Pewex&quot; and &quot;Baltona&quot; stores in all Polish cities, where goods could only be bought with hard currency. It even introduced its own &quot;ersatz&quot; U.S. currency (&quot;bony PeKaO&quot; in Polish). This paralleled the financial practices in East Germany running its own ration stamps at the same time. The trend led to an unhealthy state of affairs where the chief determinant of economic status was access to hard currency. This situation was incompatible with any remaining ideals of socialism, which were soon completely abandoned at the community level.

In this desperate situation, all development and growth in the Polish economy slowed to a crawl. Most visibly, work on most of the major investment projects that had begun in the 1970s was stopped. As a result, most Polish cities acquired at least one infamous example of a large unfinished building languishing in a state of limbo. While some of these, such as the Szkieletor skyscraper in Kraków, were eventually finished decades later, most were never finished at all, wasting the considerable resources devoted to their construction. Polish investment in economic infrastructure and technological development fell rapidly, ensuring that the country lost whatever ground it had gained relative to Western European economies in the 1970s. To escape the constant economic and political pressures during these years, and the general sense of hopelessness, many family income providers traveled for work in Western Europe, particularly West Germany (&quot;Wyjazd na saksy&quot;). During the era, hundreds of thousands of Poles left the country permanently and settled in the West, few of them returning to Poland even after the end of socialism in Poland. Tens of thousands of others went to work in countries that could offer them salaries in hard currency, notably Libya and Iraq.

After several years of the situation continuing to worsen, during which time the socialist government unsuccessfully tried various expedients to improve the performance of the economy—at one point resorting to placing military commissars to direct work in the factories — it grudgingly accepted pressures to liberalize the economy. The government introduced a series of small-scale reforms, such as allowing more small-scale private enterprises to function. However, the government also realized that it lacked the legitimacy to carry out any large-scale reforms, which would inevitably cause large-scale social dislocation and economic difficulties for most of the population, accustomed to the extensive social safety net that the socialist system had provided. For example, when the government proposed to close the Gdańsk Shipyard, a decision in some ways justifiable from an economic point of view but also largely political, there was a wave of public outrage and the government was forced to back down.

The only way to carry out such changes without social upheaval would be to acquire at least some support from the opposition side. The government accepted the idea that some kind of a deal with the opposition would be necessary, and repeatedly attempted to find common ground throughout the 1980s. However, at this point, the communists generally still believed that they should retain the reins of power for the near future, and only allowed the opposition limited, advisory participation in the running of the country. They believed that this would be essential to pacifying the Soviet Union, which they felt was not yet ready to accept a non-Communist Poland.

== Culture ==
===Television and media===
The origins of Polish television date back to the late 1930s, however, the beginning of World War II interrupted further progress at establishing a regularly televised program. The first prime state television corporation, Telewizja Polska, was founded after the war in 1952 and was hailed as a great success by the communist authorities. The foundation date corresponds to the time of the first regularly televised broadcast which occurred at 07:00 p.m CET on 25 October 1952. Initially, the auditions were broadcast to a limited number of viewers and at set dates, often a month apart. On 23 January 1953 regular shows began to appear on the first and only channel, TVP1. The second channel, TVP2, was launched in 1970 and coloured television was introduced in 1971. Most reliable sources of information in the 1950s were newspapers, most notably &quot;Trybuna Ludu&quot; (People&#x27;s Tribune).

The chief newscast under the Polish People&#x27;s Republic for over 31 years was &quot;Dziennik Telewizyjny&quot; (Television Journal). Commonly known to the viewers as &quot;Dziennik&quot;, aired in the years 1958–1989 and was utilized by the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party as a propaganda tool to control the masses. Transmitted daily at 07:30 p.m CET since 1965, it was infamous for its manipulative techniques and emotive language as well as the controversial content. For instance, the &quot;Dziennik&quot; provided more information on world news, particularly bad events, war, corruption or scandals in the West. This method was intentionally used to minimize the effects of the issues that were occurring in communist Poland at the time. With its format, the show shared many similarities with the East German &quot;Aktuelle Kamera&quot;. Throughout the 1970s, &quot;Dziennik Telewizyjny&quot; was regularly watched by over 11 million viewers, approximately in every third household in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. The long legacy of communist television continues to this day; the older generation in contemporary Poland refers to every televised news program as &quot;Dziennik&quot; and the term also became synonymous with authoritarianism, propaganda, manipulation, lies, deception and disinformation.

Under martial law in Poland, from December 1981 &quot;Dziennik&quot; was presented by officers of the Polish Armed Forces or newsreaders in military uniforms and broadcast 24-hours a day. The running time has also been extended to 60 minutes. The program returned to its original form in 1983. The audience viewed this move as an attempt to militarize the country under a military junta. As a result, several newsreaders had difficulty in finding employment after the fall of communism in 1989.

Despite the political agenda of Telewizja Polska, the authorities did emphasize the need to provide entertainment for younger viewers without exposing the children to inappropriate content. Initially created in the 1950s, an evening cartoon block called &quot;Dobranocka&quot;, which was targeted at young children, is still broadcast today under a different format. Among the most well-known animations of the 1970s and 1980s in Poland were &quot;Reksio&quot;, &quot;Bolek and Lolek&quot;, &quot;Krtek&quot; (Polish: Krecik) and &quot;The Moomins&quot;.

Countless shows were made relating to Second World War history such as &quot;Four Tank-Men and a Dog&quot; (1966–1970) and &quot;Stakes Larger Than Life&quot; with Kapitan Kloss (1967–1968), but were purely fictional and not based on real events. The horrors of war, Soviet invasion and the Holocaust were taboo topics, avoided and downplayed when possible. In most cases, producers and directors were encouraged to portray the Soviet Red Army as a friendly and victorious force which entirely liberated Poland from Nazism, Imperialism or Capitalism. The goal was to strengthen the artificial Polish-Soviet friendship and eliminate any knowledge of the crimes or acts of terror committed by the Soviets during World War II, such as the Katyn massacre. Hence, the Polish audience was more lenient towards a TV series exclusively featuring Polish history from the times of the Kingdom of Poland or the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Being produced in a then-socialist country, the shows did contain a socialist agenda, but with a more informal and comical tone; they concentrated on everyday life which was appealing to ordinary people. These include &quot;Czterdziestolatek&quot; (1975–1978), &quot;Alternatywy 4&quot; (1986–1987) and &quot;Zmiennicy&quot; (1987–1988). The wide range of topics covered featured petty disputes in the block of flats, work issues, human behaviour and interaction as well as comedy, sarcasm, drama and satire. Every televised show was censored if necessary and political content was erased. Ridiculing the communist government was illegal, though Poland remained the most liberal of the Eastern Bloc members and censorship eventually lost its authority by the mid-1980s. The majority of the TV shows and serials made during the Polish People&#x27;s Republic earned a cult status in Poland today, particularly due to their symbolism of a bygone era.

===Cinema===
In November 1945 the newly formed communist government founded the film production and distribution corporation Film Polski, and placed the well-known Polish filmmaker of Jewish descent Aleksander Ford in charge. The Film Polski output was limited; only thirteen features were released between 1947 and its dissolution in 1952, concentrating on Polish suffering at the hands of the Nazis during World War II for propaganda purposes. In 1947, Ford&#x27;s contribution to film was crucial in establishing the new National Film School in Łódź, where he taught for 20 years. The first film produced in Poland following the war was &quot;Forbidden Songs&quot; (1946), which was seen by 10.8 million people in its initial theatrical screening, almost half of the population at the time. Ford&#x27;s biggest success was &quot;Knights of the Teutonic Order&quot; from 1960, one of the most celebrated and attended Polish films in history.

The change in political climate in the 1950s gave rise to the Polish Film School movement, a training ground for some of the icons of the world cinematography. It was then that independent Polish filmmakers such as Andrzej Wajda, Roman Polanski, Wojciech Has, Kieślowski, Zanussi, Bareja and Andrzej Munk often directed films which were a political satire aimed at stultifying the communist authorities in the most gentle manner as possible. However, due to censorship, some films were not screened in cinemas until 1989 when communism ended in Central and Eastern Europe. The Hourglass Sanatorium (1973) was so controversial, the communist government forbade Wojciech Has to direct for a period of ten years. The authorities also hired or bribed film critics and literary scholars to poorly review the film. The reviewers, however, were so ineffective that in turn the film was applauded in the West and won the Jury Prize at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.

The first nominated Polish film at the Academy Awards was Knife in the Water by Polanski in 1963. Between 1974 and 1981, Polish films were nominated five times and three consecutively from 1974 to 1976.

===Architecture===
The architecture in Poland under the Polish People&#x27;s Republic had three major phases – short-lived socialist realism, modernism and functionalism. Each of these styles or trends was imposed either by the government or by communist doctrine.

Under Stalinism in the late 1940s and 1950s, the Eastern Bloc countries adopted socialist realism, an idealized and monumental realistic art intended to promote communist values, such as the emancipation of the proletariat. This style became alternatively known as Stalinist Empire style due to its grandeur, excessive size and political message (a powerful state) it tried to convey. This expensive form greatly resembled a mixture of classicist architecture and Art Deco, with archways, decorated cornices, mosaics, forged gates and columns. It was under this style that the first skyscrapers were erected in communist states. Stalin wanted to ensure that Poland would remain under communist yoke and ordered the construction of one of the largest buildings in Europe at the time, the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw. With the permission of the Polish authorities who wouldn&#x27;t dare to object, the construction started in 1952 and lasted until 1955. It was deemed a &quot;gift from the Soviet Union to the Polish people&quot; and at 237 meters in height it was an impressive landmark on European standards. With its proportions and shape it was to mediate between the Seven Sisters in Moscow and the Empire State Building in New York, but with style it possesses traditionally Polish and Art Deco architectural details.

Following the Polish October in 1956, the concept of socialist realism was condemned. It was then that modernist architecture was promoted globally, with simplistic designs made of glass, steel and concrete. Due to previous extravagances, the idea of functionalism (serving for a purpose) was encouraged by Władysław Gomułka. Prefabrication was seen as a way to construct tower blocks or plattenbau in an efficient and orderly manner. A great influence on this type of architecture was Swiss-French architect and designer Le Corbusier. Mass-prefabricated multi-family residential apartment blocks began to appear in Poland in the 1960s and their construction continued until the early 1990s, although the first examples of multi-dwelling units in Poland date back to the 1920s. The aim was to quickly urbanize rural areas, create space between individual blocks for green spaces and resettle people from densely-populated poorer districts to increase living conditions. The apartment blocks in Poland, commonly known as &quot;bloki&quot;, were built on East German and Czechoslovak standards, alongside department stores, pavilions and public spaces. As of 2017, 44% of Poles reside in blocks built between the 1960s and 1980s.

Some groundbreaking architectural achievements were made during the People&#x27;s Republic, most notably the reconstruction of Warsaw with its historical Old Town and the completion of Warszawa Centralna railway station in the 1970s under Edward Gierek&#x27;s personal patronage. It was the most modern railway station building in that part of Europe when completed and was equipped with automatic glass doors and escalators, an unlikely sight in communist countries. Another example of pure late modernism was the Smyk Department Store, constructed in 1952 when socialist realism was still in effect; it was criticized for its appearance as it resembled the styles and motifs of the pre-war capitalist Second Polish Republic.

===Education===
Communist authorities placed an emphasis on education since they considered it vital to create a new intelligentsia or an educated class that would accept and favour socialist ideas over capitalism to maintain the communists in power for a long period.

Prior to the Second World War, education in the capitalist Second Polish Republic (1918–1939) had many limitations and wasn&#x27;t readily available to all, though under the 1932 Jędrzejewicz reform primary school was made compulsory. Furthermore, the pre-war system of education was in disarray; many educational facilities were much more accessible in wealthier western and central Poland than in the rural east (Kresy), particularly in the Polesie region where there was one large school per 100 square kilometers (39 square miles). Schools were also in desperate need of staff, tutors and teachers before 1939.

After the 1947 Polish legislative election, the communists took full control of education in the newly formed Polish People&#x27;s Republic. All private schools were nationalized, subjects that could question the socialist ideology (economics, finance) were either supervised or adjusted and religious studies were completely removed from the curriculum (secularization).

Primary as well as secondary, tertiary, vocational and higher education was made free. Attendance gradually grew, which put an end to illiteracy in rural areas. The communist government also introduced new beneficial content into the system; sports and physical education were enforced and students were encouraged to learn foreign languages, especially German, Russian, or French, and from the 1980s also English. On July 15, 1961, two-year vocational career training was made obligatory to boost the number of skilled labourers and the minimum age of graduation rose to 15. Additionally, special schools were established for deaf, mute and blind children. Such institutions for the impaired were almost nonexistent in the Second Polish Republic. During the 1960s, thousands of modern schools were founded.

The number of universities nearly doubled between 1938 and 1963. Medical, agricultural, economical, engineering and sport faculties became separate colleges, under a universal communist model used in other countries of the Eastern Bloc. Theological faculties were deemed unnecessary or potentially dangerous and were therefore removed from state universities. Philosophy was also seen as superfluous. In order to strengthen the post-war Polish economy, the government created many common-labour faculties across the country, including dairying, fishing, tailoring, chemistry and mechanics to achieve a better economic output alongside efficiency. However, by 1980 the number of graduates from primary and secondary schools was so high that admission quotas for universities were introduced.

== Religion ==


The experiences in and after World War II, wherein the large ethnic Polish population was decimated, its Jewish minority was annihilated by the Germans, the large German minority was forcibly expelled from the country at the end of the war, along with the loss of the eastern territories which had a significant population of Eastern Orthodox Belarusians and Ukrainians, led to Poland becoming more homogeneously Catholic than it had previously been.

The Polish anti-religious campaign was initiated by the communist government in Poland which, under the doctrine of Marxism, actively advocated for the disenfranchisement of religion and planned atheisation. The Catholic Church, as the religion of most Poles, was seen as a rival competing for the citizens&#x27; allegiance by the government, which attempted to suppress it. To this effect the communist state conducted anti-religious propaganda and persecution of clergymen and monasteries. As in most other Communist countries, religion was not outlawed as such (an exception being Communist Albania) and was permitted by the constitution, but the state attempted to achieve an atheistic society.

The Catholic Church in Poland provided strong resistance to Communist rule and Poland itself had a long history of dissent to foreign rule. The Polish nation rallied to the Church, as had occurred in neighbouring Lithuania, which made it more difficult for the government to impose its antireligious policies as it had in the USSR, where the populace did not hold mass solidarity with the Russian Orthodox Church. It became the strongest anti-communist body during the epoch of Communism in Poland, and provided a more successful resistance than had religious bodies in most other Communist states.

The Catholic Church unequivocally condemned communist ideology. This led to the antireligious activity in Poland being compelled to take a more cautious and conciliatory line than in other Communist countries, largely failing in their attempt to control or suppress the Polish Church.

The state attempted to take control of minority churches, including the Polish Protestant and Polish Orthodox Church in order to use it as a weapon against the anti-communist efforts of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, and it attempted to control the person who was named as Metropolitan for the Polish Orthodox Church; Metropolitan Dionizy (the post-war head of the POC) was arrested and retired from service after his release.

Following the forcible conversion of Eastern Catholics in the USSR to Orthodoxy, the Polish government called on the Orthodox church in Poland to assume &#x27;pastoral care&#x27; of the Eastern Catholics in Poland. After the removal of Metropolitan Dionizy from the leadership of the Polish Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Macarius was placed in charge. He was from western Ukraine (previously eastern Poland) and had been instrumental in the compulsory conversion of eastern Catholics to orthodoxy there. Polish security forces assisted him in suppressing resistance to his taking control of Eastern Catholic parishes. Many eastern Catholics who remained in Poland after the postwar border adjustments were resettled in Western Poland in the newly acquired territories from Germany. The state in Poland gave the POC a greater number of privileges than the Roman Catholic Church in Poland; the state even gave money to this Church, although it often defaulted on promised payments, leading to a perpetual financial crisis for the POC.

== Demographics ==
Before World War II, a third of Poland&#x27;s population was composed of ethnic minorities. After the war, however, Poland&#x27;s minorities were mostly gone, due to the 1945 revision of borders, and the Holocaust. Under the National Repatriation Office (&quot;Państwowy Urząd Repatriacyjny&quot;), millions of Poles were forced to leave their homes in the eastern Kresy region and settle in the western former German territories. At the same time, approximately 5 million remaining Germans (about 8 million had already fled or had been expelled and about 1 million had been killed in 1944–46) were similarly expelled from those territories into the Allied occupation zones. Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities found themselves now mostly within the borders of the Soviet Union; those who opposed this new policy (like the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the Bieszczady Mountains region) were suppressed by the end of 1947 in the Operation Vistula.

The population of Jews in Poland, which formed the largest Jewish community in pre-war Europe at about 3.3 million people, was all but destroyed by 1945. Approximately 3 million Jews died of starvation in ghettos and labor camps, were slaughtered at the German Nazi extermination camps or by the Einsatzgruppen death squads. Between 40,000 and 100,000 Polish Jews survived the Holocaust in Poland, and another 50,000 to 170,000 were repatriated from the Soviet Union, and 20,000 to 40,000 from Germany and other countries. At its postwar peak, there were 180,000 to 240,000 Jews in Poland, settled mostly in Warsaw, Łódź, Kraków and Wrocław.

According to the national census, which took place on 14 February 1946, the population of Poland was 23.9 million, out of which 32% lived in cities and towns, and 68% lived in the countryside. The 1950 census (3 December 1950) showed the population rise to 25 million, and the 1960 census (6 December 1960) placed the population of Poland at 29.7 million. In 1950, Warsaw was again the biggest city, with a population of 804,000 inhabitants. Second was Łódź (pop. 620,000), then Kraków (pop. 344,000), Poznań (pop. 321,000), and Wrocław (pop. 309,000).

Females were the majority in the country. In 1931, there were 105.6 women for 100 men. In 1946, the difference grew to 118.5/100, but in subsequent years, number of males grew, and in 1960, the ratio was 106.7/100.

Most Germans were expelled from Poland and the annexed east German territories at the end of the war, while many Ukrainians, Rusyns and Belarusians lived in territories incorporated into the USSR. Small Ukrainian, Belarusian, Slovak, and Lithuanian minorities resided along the borders, and a German minority was concentrated near the southwestern city of Opole and in Masuria. Groups of Ukrainians and Polish Ruthenians also lived in western Poland, where they were forcefully resettled by the authorities.

As a result of the migrations and the Soviet Union&#x27;s radically altered borders under the rule of Joseph Stalin, the population of Poland became one of the most ethnically homogeneous in the world. Virtually all people in Poland claim Polish nationality, with Polish as their native tongue.

== Military ==
===World War II===
The Polish People&#x27;s Army (LWP) was initially formed during World War II as the Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division, but more commonly known as the Berling Army. Almost half of the soldiers and recruits in the Polish People&#x27;s Army were Soviet. In March 1945, Red Army officers accounted for approximately 52% of the entire corps (15,492 out of 29,372). Around 4,600 of them remained by July 1946.

It was not the only Polish formation that fought along the Allied side, nor the first one in the East – although the first Polish force formed in the USSR, the Anders Army, had by that time moved to Iran. The Polish forces soon grew beyond the 1st Division into two major commands – the Polish First Army commanded by Zygmunt Berling, and the Polish Second Army headed by Karol Świerczewski. The Polish First Army participated in the Vistula–Oder Offensive and the Battle of Kolberg (1945) before taking part in its final offensive with the Battle of Berlin.

===After the war===
Following the Second World War, the Polish Army was reorganized into six (later seven) main military districts: the Warsaw Military District with its headquarters in Warsaw, the Lublin Military District, Kraków Military District, Łódź Military District, Poznań Military District, the Pomeranian Military District with its headquarters in Toruń and the Silesian Military District in Katowice.

Throughout the late 1940s and early 50s the Polish Army was under the command of Polish-born Marshal of the Soviet Union Konstantin Rokossovsky, who was intentionally given the title &quot;Marshal of Poland&quot; and was also Minister of National Defense. It was heavily tied into the Soviet military structures and was intended to increase Soviet influence as well as control over the Polish units in case of war. This process, however, was stopped in the aftermath of the Polish October in 1956. Rokossovsky, viewed as a Soviet puppet, was excluded from the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party and driven out back to the Soviet Union where he remained a hero until death.

== Geography ==

Geographically, the Polish People&#x27;s Republic bordered the Baltic Sea to the North; the Soviet Union (via the Russian SFSR (Kaliningrad Oblast), Lithuanian, Byelorussian and Ukrainian SSRs) to the east; Czechoslovakia to the south and East Germany to the west. After World War II, Poland&#x27;s borders were redrawn, following the decision taken at the Tehran Conference of 1943 at the insistence of the Soviet Union. Poland lost 77,000 km2 of territory in its eastern regions (Kresy), gaining instead the smaller but much more industrialized (however ruined) so-called &quot;Regained Territories&quot; east of the Oder-Neisse line.

==Administration==

The Polish People&#x27;s Republic was divided into several voivodeships (the Polish unit of administrative division). After World War II, the new administrative divisions were based on the pre-war ones. The areas in the East that were not annexed by the Soviet Union had their borders left almost unchanged. Newly acquired territories in the west and north were organized into the voivodeships of Szczecin, Wrocław, Olsztyn and partially joined to Gdańsk, Katowice and Poznań voivodeships. Two cities were granted voivodeship status: Warsaw and Łódź.
In 1950, new voivodeships were created: Koszalin – previously part of Szczecin, Opole – previously part of Katowice, and Zielona Góra – previously part of Poznań, Wrocław and Szczecin voivodeships. In addition, three other cities were granted the voivodeship status: Wrocław, Kraków and Poznań.

In 1973, Poland&#x27;s voivodeships were changed again. This reorganization of the administrative division of Poland was mainly a result of local government reform acts of 1973 to 1975. In place of the three-level administrative division (voivodeship, powiat, gmina), a new two-level administrative division was introduced (49 small voivodeships and communes). The three smallest voivodeships: Warsaw, Kraków and Łódź had a special status of municipal voivodeship; the city mayor (&quot;prezydent miasta&quot;) was also province governor.

<text>Qʼumarkaj (Kʼicheʼ: ) (sometimes rendered as Gumarkaaj, Gumarcaj, Cumarcaj or Kumarcaaj) is an archaeological site in the southwest of the El Quiché department of Guatemala. Qʼumarkaj is also known as Utatlán, the Nahuatl translation of the city&#x27;s name. The name comes from Kʼicheʼ &quot;Qʼumarkah&quot; &quot;Place of old reeds&quot;.

Qʼumarkaj was one of the most powerful Maya cities when the Spanish arrived in the region in the early 16th century. It was the capital of the Kʼicheʼ Maya in the Late Postclassic Period. At the time of the Spanish Conquest, Qʼumarkaj was a relatively new capital, with the capital of the Kʼicheʼ kingdom having originally been situated at Jakawitz (identified with the archaeological site Chitinamit) and then at Pismachiʼ. Qʼumarkaj was founded during the reign of king Qʼuqʼumatz (&quot;Feathered Serpent&quot; in Kʼicheʼ) in the early 15th century, immediately to the north of Pismachiʼ. In 1470 the city was seriously weakened by a rebellion among the nobility that resulted in the loss of key allies of the Kʼicheʼ.

Archaeologically and ethnohistorically, Qʼumarkaj is the best known of the Late Postclassic highland Maya capitals. The earliest reference to the site in Spanish occurs in Hernán Cortés&#x27; letters from Mexico. Although the site has been investigated, little reconstruction work has taken place. The surviving architecture, which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt, temples and palaces, has been badly damaged by the looting of stone to build the nearby town of Santa Cruz del Quiché.

The major structures of Qʼumarkaj were laid out around a plaza. They included the temple of Tohil, a jaguar god who was patron of the city, the temple of Awilix, the patron goddess of one of the noble houses, the temple of Jakawitz, a mountain deity who was also a noble patron and the temple of Qʼuqʼumatz, the Feathered Serpent, the patron of the royal house. The main ballcourt was placed between the palaces of two of the principal noble houses. Palaces, or &quot;&quot;, were spread throughout the city. There was also a platform that was used for gladiatorial sacrifice.

The area of Greater Qʼumarkaj was divided into four major political division, one for each of the most important ruling lineages, and also encompassed a number of smaller satellites sites, including Chisalin, Pismachiʼ, Atalaya and Pakaman. The site core is open to the public and includes basic infrastructure, including a small site museum.

==Etymology==
Qʼumarkaj comes from the Kʼicheʼ &quot;Qʼumqaraqʼaj&quot;. While often translated as &quot;place of old reeds&quot; or &quot;place of rotted cane&quot;, the name Qʼumaʼrkaʼaaj translates more precisely as &quot;rotted reed houses&quot; (qʼumaʼr = &quot;rotten&quot;; kaʼaaj = &quot;house or shack built of cane and reeds&quot;). It was translated as &quot;Tecpan Utatlan&quot; by the Nahuatl-speaking Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish conquistadors, with &quot;Tecpan&quot; being added to distinguish the city as being a seat of rule, equivalent to the &quot;Tollan&quot; used in Mesoamerica in earlier times.

==Location==
The ruins of the city are to the west of the modern city of Santa Cruz del Quiché. Qʼumarkaj completely occupies of an easily defended plateau surrounded by ravines over deep. The ravines are part of a drainage system feeding the Negro River, which flows into the Chixoy River and eventually into the Usumacinta River and the Gulf of Mexico. A natural causeway to the southeast of the site links the plateau with a wide plain to the east.

Qʼumarkaj is the largest in a group of five major sites tightly clustered in an area of , with the area between the sites showing signs of also having been heavily occupied. Atalaya and Pakaman lie to the east, Pismachiʼ lies to the south and Chisalin is to the north.

==Inhabitants==

In the Late Postclassic, the greater Qʼumarkaj area is estimated to have had a population of around 15,000. The inhabitants of Qʼumarkaj were divided socially between the nobility and their vassals. The nobles were known as the &quot;ajaw&quot;, while the vassals were known as the &quot;al kʼajol&quot;. The nobility were the patrilineal descendants of the founding warlords who appear to have entered as conquerors from the Gulf coast around AD 1200 and who eventually lost their original language and adopted that of their subjects. The nobles were regarded as sacred and bore royal imagery. Their vassals served as foot-soldiers and were subject to the laws laid out by the nobility, although they could receive military titles as a result of their battlefield prowess. The social divisions were deep-seated and were equivalent to strictly observed castes. The merchants were a privileged class, although they had to make tributary payments to the nobility. In addition to these classes, the population included rural labourers and artisans. Slaves were also held and included both sentenced criminals and prisoners of war.

There were twenty-four important lineages, or &#x27;, in Qʼumarkaj, closely linked to the palaces in which the nobility attended to their duties; &#x27; means &quot;big house&quot; in Kʼicheʼ, after the palace complexes that the lineages occupied. Their duties included marriage negotiations and associated feasting and ceremonial lecturing. These lineages were strongly patrilineal and were grouped into four larger, more powerful &#x27; that chose the rulers of the city. At the time of the Conquest, the four ruling &#x27; were the Kaweq, the Nijaib, the Saqik and the Ajaw Kʼicheʼ. The Kaweq and the Nijaib included nine principal lineages each, the Ajaw Kʼicheʼ included four and the Saqik had two. As well as choosing the king and king elect, the ruling Kaweq dynasty also had a lineage that produced the powerful priests of Qʼuqʼumatz, who may have served as stewards of the city.

The Kʼicheʼ kingdom was ruled by a king, a king-elect and two captains, a four-way joint rule embodied in four leaders, one from each of the four most important lineages in the city of Qʼumarkaj. This form of rule was also known among the Maya of Yucatan. The ruling lineage was the Kaweq (&quot;Rain&quot;) dynasty, that chose both the king and the king-elect. The king was known as the &quot;ajpop&quot;, &quot;He of the Mat&quot;. The king-elect bore the title of &quot;ajpop kʼamha&quot; and assisted the king until he became king himself. The Nijaib and the Saqik noble houses chose the &quot;qʼalel&quot; (supreme judge) and the Ajaw Kʼicheʼ chose the &quot;atzij winaq&quot; (speaker).

==History==
Ceramic remains from the site include pieces that date as far back as the Preclassic Period but the majority of finds date to the Late Postclassic and the height of the Kʼicheʼ kingdom.

===Founding and expansion===

The site was founded by king Qʼuqʼumatz around 1400 for its defensive position, however there is some disagreement as to whether he is a historical or a mythological figure. Qʼuqʼumatz is Kʼiche for feathered serpent, and feathered serpent is used as a title in other parts of Mesoamerica. It is probable that Qʼuqʼumatz was really the title of another &quot;ajpop&quot; mentioned in the sources, Kotujaʼ, and was actually the same individual. In the &quot;Título de los Señores de Totonicapán&quot;, an early Colonial era Kʼicheʼ document, he is listed as Qʼuqʼumatz Kotujaʼ. In the same title, his father is listed as Kotujaʼ Qʼuqʼumatz, and there is confusion in the Kʼicheʼ documents as to whether they were one and the same, or father and son with very similar names.

Kʼotuja Qʼuqʼumatz married Xlem, daughter of the king of the Tzʼutujils of Malaj, a precolumbian settlement near modern-day San Lucas Tolimán, on the shores of Lake Atitlán. Great magical powers were attributed to Qʼuqʼumatz and he was said to be able to transform himself into a snake, an eagle, a jaguar and blood. Qʼuqʼumatz had several children, one of whom (Kʼiqʼab) became king after him. Qʼuqʼumatz was killed in battle against the Kʼoja Maya.

Qʼuqʼumatz greatly expanded the Kʼicheʼ kingdom, first from Pismachiʼ and later from Qʼumarkaj. At this time, the Kʼicheʼs were closely allied with the Kaqchikels. Qʼuqʼumatz sent his daughter to marry the lord of the Kʼoja, a Maya people based in the Cuchumatan mountains, somewhere between Sacapulas and Huehuetenango. Instead of marrying her and submitting to the Kʼicheʼ-Kaqchikel alliance, Tekum Sikʼom, the Kʼoja king, killed the offered bride. This act initiated a war between the Kʼicheʼ-Kaqchikel of Qʼumarkaj and the Kʼoja. Qʼuqʼumatz died in the resulting battle against the Kʼoja.

With the death of his father in battle against the Kʼoja, his son and heir Kʼiqʼab swore vengeance, and two years later he led the Kʼicheʼ-Kaqchikel alliance against his enemies, together with the &quot;Ajpop Kʼamha&quot; (king-elect). The Kʼicheʼ-led army entered Kʼoja at first light, killed Tekum Sikʼom and captured his son. Kʼiqʼab recovered the bones of his father and returned to Qʼumarkaj with many prisoners and all the jade and metal that the Kʼoja possessed, after conquering various settlements in the Sacapulas area, and the Mam people near Zaculeu.

Kʼiqʼab was said to have had magical powers like his father. Kʼiqʼab was a particularly warlike king and during his reign he greatly expanded the kingdom to include Rabinal, Cobán and Quetzaltenango, and extended as far west as the Okos River, near the modern border between the Chiapas coast of Mexico and Guatemalan Pacific coast. With Kaqchikel help, the eastern frontier of the kingdom was pushed as far as the Motagua River and south as far as Escuintla. However, he also suffered a humiliating rebellion that eventually resulted in the loss of his key Kaqchikel allies. Kʼiqʼab died around 1475.

===Internal strife===
In 1470 a rebellion shook Qʼumarkaj during a great celebration that saw a large gathering that included representatives of all the most important highland peoples. Two sons of Kʼiqʼab together with some of his vassals rebelled against their king, killing many high ranking lords, Kaqchikel warriors and members of the Kaweq lineage. The rebels tried to kill Kʼiqʼab himself but he was defended by sons loyal to him in Pakaman, on the outskirts of the city. As a result of the rebellion, Kʼiqʼab was forced to make concessions to the rebelling Kʼicheʼ lords. The newly empowered Kʼicheʼ lords turned against their Kaqchikel allies, who were forced to flee Qʼumarkaj and found their own capital at Iximche.

After the death of king Kʼiqʼab in 1475 the Kʼicheʼ were engaged in warfare against both the Tzʼutujils and the Kaqchikels, perhaps in an attempt to recover the former power of Qʼumarkaj. A short time after the death of Kʼiqʼab, under the leadership of Tepepul, Qʼumarkaj attacked Iximche, the capital of the Kaqchikels, and suffered a disastrous defeat that greatly weakened the Kʼicheʼ. After this Qʼumarkaj never again directly challenged the Kaqchikels of Iximche. The next leader after Tepepul was Tekum, who was a son of Kʼiqʼab. who led the Kʼicheʼs against the Tzʼutujils and was killed in battle near the south shore of Lake Atitlan.

Late in the history of Qʼumarkaj, the Nijaib appear to have been challenging the ruling Kaweq house for supremacy.

===Conquest and destruction===
In March 1524, the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado entered Qʼumarkaj when invited by the remaining lords of the Kʼicheʼ, after he defeated the Kʼicheʼ army in the Quetzaltenango valley, in a battle that had resulted in the death of Tecun Uman, one of the four lords of the city. Alvarado feared that a trap had been laid for him by the Kʼicheʼ lords but entered the city anyway. However, he encamped on the plain outside the city rather than accepting lodgings inside. Fearing the great number of Kʼicheʼ warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry would not be able to manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Qʼumarkaj, he invited the highest lords of the city, Oxib-Keh (the &quot;ajpop&quot;) and Beleheb-Tzy (the &quot;ajpop kʼamha&quot;) to visit him in his camp. As soon as they did so, he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp. The Kʼicheʼ warriors, seeing their lords taken prisoner, attacked the Spaniards&#x27; indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers. At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured Kʼicheʼ lords burnt to death, he then proceeded to burn the entire city.

===Modern history===
The site was extensively documented in the colonial era. Francisco Ximénez, who first revealed the Kʼicheʼ epic Popul Vuh to the world, visited Qʼumarkaj in the final years of the 17th century. Miguel Rivera y Maestre wrote a report of the site for the government of Guatemala in 1834. In 1840 John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood paid a brief visit to the site after reading Rivera y Maestre&#x27;s report, and Catherwood mapped the site and produced a drawing of the Temple of Tohil. In 1865, the French architect Cesar Daly mapped the five clustered sites that include Qʼumarkaj, although the maps have since been lost. A more detailed survey of the site was made by Alfred P. Maudslay in 1887, being published between 1889 and 1902. Archeological excavations were carried out in the 1950s and the 1970s.

Jorge F. Guillemín cleared the ruins in 1956, mapped the surviving structures, as well as mapping the central Kʼicheʼ region and Qʼumarkaj&#x27;s satellite sites. The State University of New York at Albany spent three seasons excavating the ruins in the early 1970s. Kenneth Brown of the University of Houston started major excavations at Qʼumarkaj in 1977.

In 2003, the Proyecto Etnoarqueológico Qʼumʼarkaj (&quot;Qʼumarkaj Ethnoarchaeological Project&quot;) has worked to reconstruct the history and socio-political organisation of the city through archaeological studies combined with ethnohistorical investigations.

The archaeological site is still used for traditional Maya ceremonies, and is one of the most popular destinations in Guatemala for this kind of ritual activity, especially at the solstices and for the New Year.

==Site description==

The site can be visited, although little restoration work has been done to it. Various temple pyramids, the remains of palaces (mostly reduced to mounds of rubble) and a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame can be seen in the site core. In the Greater Qʼumarkaj area there were four ballcourts, one in each of the four major political divisions of the city, testifying to the central role of the ballgame ritual in the sociopolitical organisation of the city.

Cut stone originally facing the buildings was taken to build the new buildings of Santa Cruz del Quiché; the ruins were still being mined for construction material through the late 19th century, doing extensive damage to the remains of the old buildings.

The major structures of Qʼumarkaj were laid out around a plaza, which had a plaster floor. The Kʼicheʼ colonnaded buildings at Qʼumarkaj appear to indicate ties with the distant city of Mayapan in the Yucatan Peninsula. The parallels also include skull imagery, effigy figure censers, squatting figures and the generous application of stucco. A combined aerial and surface analysis of the ruins has revealed a strongly patterned arrangement with repeating combinations of pyramids, long structures and multipatio residential complexes. These repeating combinations appear to be linked to the different &#x27; lineages. In addition there appears to be a larger division of the site, separating it into northwestern and southwestern halves. The dividing line runs from the west along a street to the central plaza, crosses the ballcourt and the plaza, then separates the northern and eastern branches of the site up to the rim of the canyon on the eastern side. This larger site division places six &#x27; complexes in the northern half and six in the south, although this larger division may not have been strictly along lineage lines, since Kaweq-linked structures are found in both halves of the site. The Kaweq and their allies dominated most of the site, with the Nijaib occupying the eastern portion, possibly as far as the satellite site of Atalaya.

===Temple of Tohil===

The plaza was dominated by the Temple of Tohil, who was a jaguar deity associated with the sun and with rain and was the patron deity of Qʼumarkaj. This temple lies on the western side of the main plaza. The standing remains are reduced to the rubble and mud core of the temple, with an opening where modern Maya still make offerings. As late as the middle of the 19th century, this temple was much better preserved and was described by John Lloyd Stephens. Originally the temple consisted of a steep pyramid with stairways on three sides, all except the west, and a temple building was on the summit. The base was on each side and the exterior of the building was covered in painted stucco. Catherwood&#x27;s copy of Rivera y Maestre&#x27;s drawing of the temple showed the body of the pyramid divided into four talud-tablero terraces and 19 steps in each of the three stairways, while Rivera y Maestra&#x27;s drawing depicts 24 steps and six terraces. Francisco Ximénez, writing at the end of the 17th century, described the temple as the tallest building in Qʼumarkaj. The identity of the temple as that of Tohil was known during the lifetime of Ximénez, when 30 steps were visible in each stairway and the remains of the pillars that supported the temple roof were still standing. The building style of the Temple of Tohil is similar to that of the most important temples of Mayapan and Chichen Itza, far to the north in the Yucatan Peninsula. The pillars possibly once supported an elaborate masonry roof.

The Temple of Tohil was used for human sacrifice, the bodies of the sacrificial victims were probably hurled down the front stairway before being decapitated and the heads places on a skull rack. This &quot;tzumpan&quot; was likely to have been located immediately to the southeast of the temple, in an area that is now buried under rubble fallen from the temple itself.

An image of a jaguar was found painted onto the stucco of the temple, an animal that was a nahual of the ruling Kaweq dynasty.

===Temple of Awilix===

The Temple of Awilix is on the east side of the plaza. Awilix was the patron goddess of the Nijaib lineage and is identified with Ixbalanque, one of the Hero Twins from the Popul Vuh. According to a drawing made by Rivera y Maestre, the temple of Awilix was not as tall as the temple of Tohil. This structure was apparently the second most important temple in Qʼumarkaj. Originally this temple was formed of a large rectangular platform supporting a smaller platform and a temple structure on the east side. A wide stairway climbed the west side of the temple, it was flanked on the lower level by two large talud-tablero panels. The exterior stonework of the building has been completely stripped away. The temple is similar in form to a temple mound on the west side of the first plaza in Iximche, the postclassic capital of the Kaqchikel Maya. There were four principal phases of construction and there is evidence that the temple had been repaired various times prior to the Conquest. The floor under the third phase of construction had been painted dark green. Archaeological investigations found fragments of incense burners underneath the first building phase.

===Temple of Jakawitz===
A large mound on the south side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, a deity of the mountains and the patron of the Ajaw Kʼicheʼ lineage. Like the other structures of Qʼumarkaj, all the stone facing has been robbed, leaving only a rubble and mud core. This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace on the southern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.

===Temple of Qʼuqʼumatz===
The temple of Qʼuqʼumatz was a circular temple of the feathered serpent, and a palace in honour of the Kawek lineage, the ruling dynasty of the city. The temple is now only a circular impression in the surface of the main plaza. It is located directly between the temples of Tohil and Awilix, slightly north of the central axis of the Tohil temple and slightly south of the axis of the Awilix temple. From the traces left in the plaza it is evident that the temple consisted of a circular wall measuring across, running around a circular platform, with a wide circular passage between the two. The whole structure probably once supported a roof and there were small stone platforms on the east and west sides of the temple, each about wide.

The priests of Qʼuqʼumatz were drawn from an important lineage among the ruling Kaweq dynasty and this was likely to have been a source of power and prestige for the Kaweq. The temple of Qʼuqʼumatz must have been completely dismantled very soon after the Spanish Conquest since it is not mentioned by any of the Colonial era visitors, and early drawings of the site show only vegetation where the temple once stood. The tradition of circular temples dedicated to the Feathered Serpent deity was an ancient one in the Mesoamerican cultural region.

===Ballcourt===
The Ballcourt lies close to, and just south of, the temple of Tohil, on the southwest side of the plaza. The ballcourt still retains its distinctive shape, although the structures have been robbed of their facing. The visible ballcourt was one of four in Qʼumarkaj and was administered by the Popol Winaq branch of the ruling Kaweq lineage. The ballcourt is aligned east–west with a length of . The ballcourt was located exactly between the palaces of the Kaweq and the Ajaw Kʼicheʼ, which were located to the north and the south of the ballcourt. Correspondingly, the north range of the ballcourt appears to have been associated with the Kaweq lineage and the south range with the Ajaw Kʼicheʼ lineage.

===Palaces===
A small palace belonging to the Nijaib lineage was located directly behind the temple of Awilix. These lineage houses, &#x27;, are found throughout the city of Qʼumarkaj. As with the other buildings of the site, the outer stonework and plastering has been lost. The &#x27; are long rectangular structures located beside the plazas upon high platforms. Upon these platforms, the palaces generally consisted of two levels, a lower roofed antechamber with a second, higher level supporting the main rooms of the structure. Some of the larger palaces had several stairways giving access to the antechamber, and multiple doors and pillars opening into the rooms of main building.

Another &quot;&quot; palace structure lies to the southeast of the main plaza. Excavations in 1972 uncovered a simple superstructure consisting of a room with a bench at the back and an altar in the middle. Six funerary urns were found in the remains of the palace, one of which was found near the altar and contained rich offerings that included a gold necklace. There were traces of hearths at each extreme of the main chamber.

===Other structures===
In the central plaza there are traces of thirteen small platforms that once stood there. Three of these, each measuring wide, were located to the north of the Temple of Kʼucumatz. A line of five similar structures was also located to the south of the same temple, with an alternating pattern of a circular platform, then a square platform, followed by another circular platform and so on. There was a sixth small platform nearby, which was square in shape. These platforms appear to have served as altars.

To the south of the line of platforms are the traces of two larger square platforms. One of these measured on each side, the other measured per side. A circular impression lies between these two platforms, which is all that remains of another platform, of a different type, that must have stood there. The larger platforms may also have served as auxiliary altars to those of the principle temples.

A large square platform in the northwest section of the central plaza, measuring on each side, it is located immediately behind the Temple of Tohil and stands high. Although, typically for the site, the outer stonework has been robbed, there are the remains of six layers of plaster on the floor of the platform&#x27;s upper surface. This platform has been identified as the &quot;sokibʼal&quot;, the platform of gladiators described in early sources. This platform seems to have been closely linked to the military lineages of the Kaweq, such as the Nima Rajpop Achij.

Two large platforms lie in the southeastern section of the main plaza, their use remains unknown.

===Caves===

In addition, a series of three caves tunnel straight into the limestone immediately to the north of the site. The first and most extensive cave is about 30 meters long with various altars carved into the rock inside. Some modern Quiché, although officially Roman Catholic, still burn candles and incense at the ruined temples. The caves may have represented &quot;Tulán Zuyuá&quot;, the &quot;Place of Seven Caves&quot; described in the Kʼicheʼ origin legend recounted in the Popul Vuh.

==Satellite sites==
A number of other archaeological sites are included within the area of Greater Qʼumarkaj, usually referred to as &#x27;Greater Utatlan&#x27;.

===Chisalin===
Chisalin is also known by the alternative names of Pilokabʼ and Muqwitz Pilokabʼ. Chisalin is located a few hundred meters north of Qʼumarkaj. The ruins are located on a narrow strip of land with an area of surrounded by steep ravines. On the northeast side the strip is connected to a plateau that forms a part of the plain to the east of Qʼumarkaj. Chisalin has a small, heavily eroded plaza, and the whole strip is occupied by ruins, with the exception of a small section.

===Pismachiʼ===
Pismachiʼ (sometimes referred to as Ismachiʼ) occupies a small plateau south of the site core and is surrounded by steep ravines. The plateau is separated from the Qʼumarkaj plateau by the ravine containing the Ismachiʼ river. Pismachiʼ was the Kʼicheʼ capital before it was moved to nearby Qʼumarkaj, and was probably founded early in the 14th century. Its location was never forgotten by the local Kʼicheʼs, although it was from time to time lost by outside investigators. French missionary Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg located Pismachiʼ in the middle of the 19th century, it was then lost until it was relocated in 1956 by Jorge Guillemín, working in collaboration with the government of Guatemala, the location was reconfirmed by Robert Carmack in 1969. Although the Pismachiʼ plateau is twice the size of the Qʼumarkaj plateau, the ruins occupy a small area on the southeast portion of the hilltop. The ruins are still used for the rituals of modern Kʼicheʼ shamans.

===Atalaya===
Atalaya (Spanish for &quot;watchtower&quot;) is located at a distance of to the east of the site core. The site was built upon four terraces that dominated the approach to Qʼumarkaj, at the beginning of the eastern plain occupied by the modern town of Santa Cruz del Quiché. The site was very small, covering an area of . A paved avenue (or sacbe) is said by locals to have passed the tower, which was closely linked to the Nijaib lineage. Between Qʼumarkaj and Atalaya there was a place where criminals were punished. Atalaya is used for modern Kʼicheʼ rituals and is the focus of local folklore, which relates that Tecún Umán is buried there and that it is haunted by tzitzimit spirits. Towards the end of the 20th century the majority of the land making up the site still belonged to the Rojas family, descendants of the kings of Qʼumarkaj.

===Pakaman===
Pakaman is located east of Atalaya and east of Qʼumarkaj. The same &quot;sakbe&quot; that passed the north side of Atalaya is said to pass south of Pakaman. The original name of Pakaman is likely to have been &quot;Panpetaq&quot; (&quot;place of arrival&quot;) and was the first important outpost on the entry road to Qʼumarkaj.

<doc id="355136" wikidata="Q669802" url="?curid=355136" title="Quiché Department">
<text>Quiché () is a department of Guatemala. It is in the heartland of the Kʼicheʼ (Quiché) people, one of the Maya peoples, to the north-west of Guatemala City. The capital is Santa Cruz del Quiché. The word Kʼicheʼ comes from the language of the same name, which means &quot;many trees&quot;.

==Population==
Quiché has historically been one of the most populous departments of Guatemala. At the 2018 census it had a population of 949,261. Mayans account for 88.6% of the department&#x27;s population. Kʼicheʼ people are the largest Mayan ethnic group in the department, and account for 65.1% of the total population. The department is named after them.

While most of its indigenous population speaks the Kʼicheʼ (Quiché) language, other Mayan languages spoken in the department are Ixil (Nebaj - Chajul - Cotzal area), Uspantek (Uspantán area), Sakapultek (Sacapulas area), as well as Poqomchiʼ and Q&#x27;eqchi&#x27; in the northeast, bordering the Alta Verapaz department.

==Geography==
The topographical composition of Quiché is dominated by the central highlands and the mountain ranges of the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes, Sierra de Chuacús, and the foothills of the volcanic mountain range on the department&#x27;s South-Western border with Chimaltenango, which together make up for 79% of the department&#x27;s territory. The northern part of the department is formed by tropical lowlands which cover 21% of the department&#x27;s territory.

The principal drainage basins in El Quiché are the Salinas, Motagua, Xaclbal and Ixcán river basins. The Salinas river basin (3668 km2), includes the Chixoy River which is a tributary of the Río Salinas and Río Usumacinta. The Motagua basin (1042 km2) includes the Río Grande which is an important tributary of the Río Motagua. The smaller Xaclbal (779 km2) and Ixcán basins (187 km2) are situated in the North-East of El Quiché. El Quiché has a small number of shallow lakes (&quot;lagunas&quot;): laguna de Lemoa and the laguna de La Estancia, both in Santa Cruz del Quiché, and the laguna de San Antonio in San Antonio Ilotenango.

==Tourism==

Places of interest in the department include the town of Chichicastenango and the ruins of Q&#x27;umarkaj. The department has several pre-colonial archeological sites, including Q&#x27;umarkaj (near Santa Cruz del Quiché), Pascual Abaj (in Chichicastenango), Cerro de San Andrés (in San Andrés Sajcabajá), Chutixtiox (near Sacapulas), Los Cerritos and La Laguna (in Canillá). Most of these sites are used as ceremonial centers in the Maya religion.

A regional museum can be found in Chichicastenango and Nebaj.

Though not as well known as the Santo Tomás church in Chichicastenango most other towns in the department have catholic churches dating from the colonial era.

The Visis Cabá biosphere reserve (450 km2) is the only protected natural reserve in El Quiché. It is located in the North of Chajul, on the communal lands of the Ixil communities. The creation of protected natural reserves is being considered for El Amay in Chicamán and La Vega del Zope in Chinique.

== Crime ==
Crime in the Quiché department is low, the homicide rate of 3 per 100,000 people is more akin to Western Europe than to the Guatemalan region in general.

== Municipalities ==

The department is divided into 21 municipalities:

# Canillá
# Chajul
# Chicamán
# Chiché
# Chichicastenango
# Chinique
# Cunén
# Joyabaj
# Nebaj
# Sacapulas
# Patzité
# Pachalúm
# Ixcán
# San Andrés Sajcabajá
# San Antonio Ilotenango
# San Bartolomé Jocotenango
# San Juan Cotzal
# San Pedro Jocopilas
# Santa Cruz del Quiché
# Uspantán
# Zacualpa

<text>Since 1975 the former city of Herbede is a part of the city of Witten (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). As one of the eight boroughs of Witten, it is now called Witten-Herbede. Before the incorporation with Witten in 1975, Herbede was a city in the administrative district Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis. Herbede is placed about 5 kilometres southwest of the city of Witten in the southern Ruhr area in the Ruhr valley and has about 13,100 inhabitants today. Herbede has good bus connections and is served by bus lines 320, 374, 375, SB38, SB67 and at the weekend by night bus NE17. There are direct bus connections to central Witten, Witten-Annen, Witten-Rüdinghausen, Witten-Heven, Ruhr University Bochum, Wetter, Gevelsberg, Ennepetal, Hattingen and Wuppertal.

:1347: First mention of a bridge across the Ruhr
:1589: Herbede becomes a part of Martin Luther&#x27;s Reformation
:1788: The first steel factory opens
:1951: Herbede gains the right to name itself &quot;city&quot;
:1975: Incorporation with Witten

==City-districts==
Herbede is divided into five city-districts:
*81 Herbede-Ort
*82 Vormholz
*83 Bommerholz-Muttental
*84 Durchholz
*85 Kaempen and Buchholz

==Former boroughs==
Before Herbede became a part of Witten, it had five boroughs: Vormholz, Bommerholz, Durchholz, Kaempen and Buchholz. They lost their status after the incorporation with Witten. The borough of Buchholz is thought to be one of the oldest communities in the entire Ruhr area. Historians believe that the first settlers came to Buchholz more than 2000 years ago.

<doc id="355140" wikidata="Q1630568" url="?curid=355140" title="Monad (category theory)">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a monad is a triple formula_1 consisting of a functor &quot;T&quot; from a category to itself and two natural transformations formula_2 that satisfy the conditions like associativity. For example, if formula_3 are functors adjoint to each other, then formula_4 together with formula_2 determined by the adjoint relation is a monad.

In concise terms, a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors of some fixed category (an endofunctor is a functor mapping a category to itself). According to John Baez, a monad can be considered at least in two ways: 
# A monad as a generalized monoid; this is clear since a monad is a monoid in a certain category,
# A monad as a tool for studying algebraic gadgets; for example, a group can be described by a certain monad.

Monads are used in the theory of pairs of adjoint functors, and they generalize closure operators on partially ordered sets to arbitrary categories. Monads are also useful in the theory of datatypes, the denotational semantics of imperative programming languages, and in functional programming languages, allowing languages without mutable state to do things such as simulate for-loops; see Monad (functional programming).

A monad is also called, especially in old literature, a triple, triad, standard construction and fundamental construction.

== Introduction and definition ==

A monad is a certain type of endofunctor. For example, if formula_6 and formula_7 are a pair of adjoint functors, with formula_6 left adjoint to formula_7, then the composition formula_10 is a monad. If formula_6 and formula_7 are inverse to each other, the corresponding monad is the identity functor. In general, adjunctions are not equivalences—they relate categories of different natures. The monad theory matters as part of the effort to capture what it is that adjunctions &#x27;preserve&#x27;. The other half of the theory, of what can be learned likewise from consideration of formula_13, is discussed under the dual theory of &quot;comonads&quot;.

===Formal definition===

Throughout this article, formula_14 denotes a category. A &quot;monad&quot; on formula_14 consists of an endofunctor formula_16 together with two natural transformations: formula_17 (where formula_18 denotes the identity functor on formula_14) and formula_20 (where formula_21 is the functor formula_22 from formula_14 to formula_14). These are required to fulfill the following conditions (sometimes called coherence conditions):

* formula_25 (as natural transformations formula_26); here formula_27 and formula_28 are formed by &quot;horizontal composition&quot;.
* formula_29 (as natural transformations formula_30; here formula_31 denotes the identity transformation from formula_32 to formula_32).

We can rewrite these conditions using the following commutative diagrams:
See the article on natural transformations for the explanation of the notations formula_27 and formula_28, or see below the commutative diagrams not using these notions:

The first axiom is akin to the associativity in monoids if we think of formula_36 as the monoid&#x27;s binary operation, and the second axiom is akin to the existence of an identity element (which we think of as given by formula_37). Indeed, a monad on formula_14 can alternatively be defined as a monoid in the category formula_39 whose objects are the endofunctors of formula_14 and whose morphisms are the natural transformations between them, with the monoidal structure induced by the composition of endofunctors.

===The power set monad===

The &quot;power set monad&quot; is a monad formula_41 on the category formula_42: For a set formula_43 let formula_44 be the power set of formula_43 and for a function formula_46 let formula_47 be the function between the power sets induced by taking direct images under formula_48. For every set formula_43, we have a map formula_50, which assigns to every formula_51 the singleton formula_52. The function

:formula_53

takes a set of sets to its union. These data describe a monad.

===Remarks===
The axioms of a monad are formally similar to the monoid axioms. In fact, monads are special cases of monoids, namely they are precisely the monoids among endofunctors formula_54, which is equipped with the multiplication given by composition of endofunctors.

Composition of monads is not, in general, a monad. For example, the double power set functor formula_55 does not admit any monad structure.

=== Comonads ===
The categorical dual definition is a formal definition of a &quot;comonad&quot; (or &quot;cotriple&quot;); this can be said quickly in the terms that a comonad for a category formula_14 is a monad for the opposite category formula_57. It is therefore a functor formula_58 from formula_14 to itself, with a set of axioms for &quot;counit&quot; and &quot;comultiplication&quot; that come from reversing the arrows everywhere in the definition just given.

Monads are to monoids as comonads are to &quot;comonoids&quot;. Every set is a comonoid in a unique way, so comonoids are less familiar in abstract algebra than monoids; however, comonoids in the category of vector spaces with its usual tensor product are important and widely studied under the name of coalgebras.

===Terminological history===
The notion of monad was invented by Roger Godement in 1958 under the name &quot;standard construction&quot;. Monad has been called &quot;dual standard construction&quot;, &quot;triple&quot;, &quot;monoid&quot; and &quot;triad&quot;. The term &quot;monad&quot; is used at latest 1967, by Jean Bénabou.

==Examples==

===Identity===

The identity functor on a category formula_14 is a monad. Its multiplication and unit are the identity function on the objects of formula_14.

===Monads arising from adjunctions===

Any adjunction

:formula_62

gives rise to a monad on &quot;C&quot;. This very widespread construction works as follows: the endofunctor is the composite

:formula_63

This endofunctor is quickly seen to be a monad, where the unit map stems from the unit map formula_64 of the adjunction, and the multiplication map is constructed using the counit map of the adjunction:

:formula_65
In fact, any monad can be found as an explicit adjunction of functors using the Eilenberg–Moore category formula_66 (the category of formula_32-algebras).

====Double dualization====
The &quot;double dualization monad&quot;, for a fixed field &quot;k&quot; arises from the adjunction

:formula_68

where both functors are given by sending a vector space &quot;V&quot; to its dual vector space formula_69. The associated monad sends a vector space &quot;V&quot; to its double dual formula_70. This monad is discussed, in much greater generality, by .

====Closure operators on partially ordered sets====
For categories arising from partially ordered sets formula_71 (with a single morphism from formula_72 to formula_73 if and only if formula_74), then the formalism becomes much simpler: adjoint pairs are Galois connections and monads are closure operators.

====Free-forgetful adjunctions====
For example, let formula_7 be the forgetful functor from the category Grp of groups to the category Set of sets, and let formula_6 be the free group functor from the category of sets to the category of groups. Then formula_6 is left adjoint of formula_7. In this case, the associated monad formula_4 takes a set formula_80 and returns the underlying set of the free group formula_81.
The unit map of this monad is given by the maps
:formula_82
including any set formula_80 into the set formula_81 in the natural way, as strings of length 1. Further, the multiplication of this monad is the map
:formula_85
made out of a natural concatenation or &#x27;flattening&#x27; of &#x27;strings of strings&#x27;. This amounts to two natural transformations.
The preceding example about free groups can be generalized to any type of algebra in the sense of a variety of algebras in universal algebra. Thus, every such type of algebra gives rise to a monad on the category of sets. Importantly, the algebra type can be recovered from the monad (as the category of Eilenberg–Moore algebras), so monads can also be seen as generalizing varieties of universal algebras.

Another monad arising from an adjunction is when formula_32 is the endofunctor on the category of vector spaces which maps a vector space formula_87 to its tensor algebra formula_88, and which maps linear maps to their tensor product. We then have a natural transformation corresponding to the embedding of formula_87 into its tensor algebra, and a natural transformation corresponding to the map from formula_90 to formula_88 obtained by simply expanding all tensor products.

===Codensity monads===

Under mild conditions, functors not admitting a left adjoint also give rise to a monad, the so-called codensity monad. For example, the inclusion

:formula_92

does not admit a left adjoint. Its codensity monad is the monad on sets sending any set &quot;X&quot; to the set of ultrafilters on &quot;X&quot;. This and similar examples are discussed in .

===Monads used in denotational semantics===

The following monads over the category of sets are used in denotational semantics of imperative programming languages, and analogous constructions are used in functional programming.

====The maybe monad====

The endofunctor of the maybe or partiality monad adds a disjoint point:

:formula_93
:formula_94

The unit is given by the inclusion of a set formula_80 into formula_96:

:formula_97
:formula_98

The multiplication maps elements of formula_80 to themselves, and the two disjoint points in formula_100 to the one in formula_101.

In both functional programming and denotational semantics, the maybe monad models partial computations, that is, computations that may fail.

====The state monad====

Given a set formula_102, the endofunctor of the state monad maps each set formula_80 to the set of functions formula_104. The component of the unit at formula_80 maps each element formula_106 to the function

:formula_107
:formula_108

The multiplication maps the function formula_109 to the function

:formula_110
:formula_111

In functional programming and denotational semantics, the state monad models stateful computations.

====The environment monad====

Given a set formula_112, the endofunctor of the reader or environment monad maps each set formula_80 to the set of functions formula_114. Thus, the endofunctor of this monad is exactly the hom functor formula_115. The component of the unit at formula_80 maps each element formula_106 to the constant function formula_118.

In functional programming and denotational semantics, the environment monad models computations with access to some read-only data.

====The list and set monads====

The list or nondeterminism monad maps a set &quot;X&quot; to the set of finite sequences (i.e., lists) with elements from &quot;X&quot;. The unit maps an element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; to the singleton list [x]. The multiplication concatenates a list of lists into a single list.

In functional programming, the list monad is used to model nondeterministic computations. The covariant powerset monad is also known as the set monad, and is also used to model nondeterministic computation.

== Algebras for a monad ==
Given a monad formula_119 on a category formula_14, it is natural to consider &quot;formula_32-algebras&quot;, i.e., objects of formula_14 acted upon by formula_32 in a way which is compatible with the unit and multiplication of the monad. More formally, a formula_32-algebra formula_125 is an object formula_72 of formula_14 together with an arrow formula_128 of formula_14 called the &quot;structure map&quot; of the algebra such that the diagrams

commute.

A morphism formula_130 of formula_32-algebras is an arrow formula_132 of formula_14 such that the diagram commutes. formula_32-algebras form a category called the &quot;Eilenberg–Moore category&quot; and denoted by formula_66.

=== Examples ===

==== Algebras over the free group monad ====
For example, for the free group monad discussed above, a formula_32-algebra is a set formula_80 together with a map from the free group generated by formula_80 towards formula_80 subject to associativity and unitality conditions. Such a structure is equivalent to saying that formula_80 is a group itself.

==== Algebras over the distribution monad ====
Another example is the distribution monad formula_141 on the category of sets. It is defined by sending a set formula_80 to the set of functions formula_143 with finite support and such that their sum is equal to formula_144. In set-builder notation, this is the setformula_145By inspection of the definitions, it can be shown that algebras over the distribution monad are equivalent to convex sets, i.e., sets equipped with operations formula_146 for formula_147 subject to axioms resembling the behavior of convex linear combinations formula_148 in Euclidean space.

==== Algebras over the symmetric monad ====
Another useful example of a monad is the symmetric algebra functor on the category of formula_149-modules for a commutative ring formula_149.formula_151sending an formula_149-module formula_153 to the direct sum of symmetric tensor powersformula_154where formula_155. For example, formula_156 where the formula_149-algebra on the right is considered as a module. Then, an algebra over this monad are commutative formula_149-algebras. There are also algebras over the monads for the alternating tensors formula_159 and total tensor functors formula_160 giving anti-symmetric formula_149-algebras, and free formula_149-algebras, soformula_163where the first ring is the free anti-symmetric algebra over formula_149 in formula_165-generators and the second ring is the free algebra over formula_149 in formula_165-generators.

==== Commutative algebras in E-infinity ring spectra ====
There is an analogous construction for commutative formula_168-algebraspg 113 which gives commutative formula_43-algebras for a commutative formula_168-algebra formula_43. If formula_172 is the category of formula_43-modules, then the functor formula_174 is the monad given byformula_175whereformula_176 formula_177-times. Then there is an associated category formula_178 of commutative formula_43-algebras from the category of algebras over this monad.

== Monads and adjunctions ==
As was mentioned above, any adjunction gives rise to a monad. Conversely, every monad arises from some adjunction, namely the free–forgetful adjunction

:formula_180

whose left adjoint sends an object &quot;X&quot; to the free &quot;T&quot;-algebra &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). However, there are usually several distinct adjunctions giving rise to a monad: let formula_181 be the category whose objects are the adjunctions formula_182 such that formula_183 and whose arrows are the morphisms of adjunctions that are the identity on formula_14. Then the above free–forgetful adjunction involving the Eilenberg–Moore category formula_66 is a terminal object in formula_181. An initial object is the Kleisli category, which is by definition the full subcategory of formula_66 consisting only of free &quot;T&quot;-algebras, i.e., &quot;T&quot;-algebras of the form formula_188 for some object &quot;x&quot; of &quot;C&quot;.

===Monadic adjunctions===

Given any adjunction formula_189 with associated monad &quot;T&quot;, the functor &quot;G&quot; can be factored as

:formula_190

i.e., &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) can be naturally endowed with a &quot;T&quot;-algebra structure for any &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;D&quot;. The adjunction is called a monadic adjunction if the first functor formula_191 yields an equivalence of categories between &quot;D&quot; and the Eilenberg–Moore category formula_66. By extension, a functor formula_193 is said to be monadic if it has a left adjoint formula_6 forming a monadic adjunction. For example, the free–forgetful adjunction between groups and sets is monadic, since algebras over the associated monad are groups, as was mentioned above. In general, knowing that an adjunction is monadic allows one to reconstruct objects in &quot;D&quot; out of objects in &quot;C&quot; and the &quot;T&quot;-action.

===Beck&#x27;s monadicity theorem===

&quot;Beck&#x27;s monadicity theorem&quot; gives a necessary and sufficient condition for an adjunction to be monadic. A simplified version of this theorem states that &quot;G&quot; is monadic if it is conservative (or &quot;G&quot; reflects isomorphisms, i.e., a morphism in &quot;D&quot; is an isomorphism if and only if its image under &quot;G&quot; is an isomorphism in &quot;C&quot;) and &quot;C&quot; has and &quot;G&quot; preserves coequalizers.

For example, the forgetful functor from the category of compact Hausdorff spaces to sets is monadic. However the forgetful functor from all topological spaces to sets is not conservative since there are continuous bijective maps (between non-compact or non-Hausdorff spaces) that fail to be homeomorphisms. Thus, this forgetful functor is not monadic.
The dual version of Beck&#x27;s theorem, characterizing comonadic adjunctions, is relevant in different fields such as topos theory and topics in algebraic geometry related to descent. A first example of a comonadic adjunction is the adjunction

:formula_195

for a ring homomorphism formula_196 between commutative rings. This adjunction is comonadic, by Beck&#x27;s theorem, if and only if &quot;B&quot; is faithfully flat as an &quot;A&quot;-module. It thus allows to descend &quot;B&quot;-modules, equipped with a descent datum (i.e., an action of the comonad given by the adjunction) to &quot;A&quot;-modules. The resulting theory of faithfully flat descent is widely applied in algebraic geometry.

== Uses ==

Monads are used in functional programming to express types of sequential computation (sometimes with side-effects). See monads in functional programming, and the more mathematically oriented Wikibook module .

Monads are used in the denotational semantics of impure functional and imperative programming languages.

In categorical logic, an analogy has been drawn between the monad-comonad theory, and modal logic via closure operators, interior algebras, and their relation to models of S4 and intuitionistic logics.

==Generalization==
It is possible to define monads in a 2-category formula_14. Monads described above are monads for formula_198.

<text>Walter Scott Story (June 23, 1879 – June 23, 1955) was an author of children&#x27;s books and over 140 pulp magazine stories and novelettes.

He was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Benjamin Franklin Story, a printer from Lyndon, Vermont and Rebecca Jennie Turner of St. Joseph, Michigan. Educated in public schools he began his career in 1895 as an office boy at the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company in Springfield. On February 27, 1908 he married Margaret Helena Healy. By 1918, they were living in Westfield, Massachusetts and he had become secretary to the president of the company. From 1923 to 1942, he had moved to East Orange, New Jersey and worked in New York City as the manager of literature for the New York Life Insurance Company. His wife died in 1937. On March 14, 1940, he married Elsie Martha Wolcott. They lived in Maplewood, New Jersey.

In his day, Story&#x27;s works were well-received. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; described his 1926 children&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;The Uncharted Island&quot; as a swift-moving, high-interest tale interesting to children and adult readers both. In 1914, his two-part serialized story &quot;The Cruise of the Rodney Boone&quot; was positively appraised by the &quot;Holton Signal&quot; as one of the better works in boy&#x27;s interest magazine &quot;American Boy&quot;, while &quot;Skinny Harrison, Adventurer&quot; was similarly lauded by the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; in 1922.

Story was the editor of the company&#x27;s employee magazine, the &quot;Mutual Circle&quot;, from 1942 to 1946. He was a member of the Republican Party, the Sons of the American Revolution, the Authors League of America, and was a Mason. At his death, he lived in the borough of Chatham, New Jersey.

<text>The Herzegovina-Neretva Canton (; ) is one of 10 cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The canton mainly comprises the Neretva river valley area and parts of Herzegovina west of Mostar, its administrative center. It is one of the 4 cantons in the country with a Croatian majority (53.29%), although in the case of this territory it is more ethnically divided and is considered to have a mixed population.

== History ==
Before the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the present-day municipalities of East Mostar and Berkovići were part of Mostar and Stolac, while Ivanica was part of the municipality of Trebinje.

The largest city in the canton and the fifth largest city in the country is Mostar. Mostar is located on the banks of the Neretva river and is divided between Croats and Bosniaks. Mostar is known for its old bridge, Stari Most, which was constructed by the area&#x27;s Ottoman rulers, who also brought Islam to the region. Bosnian Croat forces bombed and destroyed the bridge on November 8, 1993. Upon its destruction, it had stood for 427 years and had become a symbol of a shared cultural heritage and &quot;peaceful&quot; co-existence. The bridge was reconstructed in the summer of 2004. The opening ceremony was attended by several foreign delegates including Stjepan Mesić, the President of Croatia.

Other notable cities in this canton are Čapljina, Konjic, Jablanica and Međugorje, the most significant Marian shrine in the region. Jablanica and Konjic are notable for battles which took place there during World War II and there is a large museum in Jablanica dedicated to these battles.

<text>In electrostatics, the [[coefficients]] of potential determine the relationship between the charge and electrostatic potential (electrical potential), which is purely geometric:
:formula_1

where is the surface charge on conductor . The coefficients of potential are the coefficients . should be correctly read as the potential on the -th conductor, and hence &quot;formula_2&quot; is the due to charge 1 on conductor 2.
:formula_3

Note that:

# is not dependent on the charge.

The physical content of the symmetry is as follows:
: if a charge on conductor brings conductor to a potential , then the same charge placed on would bring to the same potential .

In general, the coefficients is used when describing system of conductors, such as in the capacitor.

==Theory==
&lt;br&gt;System of conductors. The electrostatic potential at point is formula_4.
Given the electrical potential on a conductor surface (the equipotential surface or the point chosen on surface ) contained in a system of conductors :
:formula_5

where , i.e. the distance from the area-element to a particular point on conductor . is not, in general, uniformly distributed across the surface. Let us introduce the factor that describes how the actual charge density differs from the average and itself on a position on the surface of the -th conductor:
:formula_6
or
: formula_7
Then,
:formula_8
It can be shown that formula_9 is independent of the distribution formula_10. Hence, with 
:formula_11
we have
:formula_12

==Example==
In this example, we employ the method of coefficients of potential to determine the capacitance on a two-conductor system.

For a two-conductor system, the system of linear equations is
:formula_13

On a capacitor, the charge on the two conductors is equal and opposite: . Therefore,
:formula_14
and
:formula_15
Hence,
: formula_16

== Related coefficients ==
Note that the array of linear equations
:formula_17
can be inverted to
:formula_18
where the with are called the coefficients of capacity and the with are called the coefficients of electrostatic induction.

For a system of two spherical conductors held at the same potential,
:formula_19

formula_20

If the two conductors carry equal and opposite charges,
:formula_21
formula_22

The system of conductors can be shown to have similar symmetry .

<doc id="355155" wikidata="Q746711" url="?curid=355155" title="Polar orbit">
<text>A polar orbit is one in which a satellite passes above or nearly above both poles of the body being orbited (usually a planet such as the Earth, but possibly another body such as the Moon or Sun) on each revolution. It has an inclination of about 60–90 degrees to the body&#x27;s equator.

Launching satellites into polar orbit requires a larger launch vehicle to launch a given payload to a given altitude than for a near-equatorial orbit at the same altitude, because it cannot take advantage of the Earth&#x27;s rotational velocity. Depending on the location of the launch site and the inclination of the polar orbit, the launch vehicle may lose up to 460 m/s of Delta-v, approximately 5% of the Delta-v required to attain Low Earth orbit.

==Usage==
Polar orbits are used for Earth-mapping, reconnaissance satellites, as well as for some weather satellites.
The Iridium satellite constellation uses a polar orbit to provide telecommunications services.

Near-polar orbiting satellites commonly choose a sun-synchronous orbit, where each successive orbital pass occurs at the same local time of day. For some applications, such as remote sensing, it is important that &quot;changes&quot; over time are not aliased by changes in local time. Keeping the same local time on a given pass requires that the time period of the orbit be kept as short, which requires a low orbit. However, very low orbits rapidly decay due to drag from the atmosphere. Commonly used altitudes are between 700 and 800 km, producing an orbital period of about 100 minutes. The half-orbit on the Sun side then takes only 50 minutes, during which local time of day does not vary greatly.

To retain a Sun-synchronous orbit as the Earth revolves around the Sun during the year, the orbit must precess about the Earth at the same rate (which is not possible if the satellite passes directly over the pole).
Because of Earth&#x27;s equatorial bulge, an orbit inclined at a slight angle is subject to a torque, which causes precession. An angle of about 8° from the pole produces the desired precession in a 100-minute orbit.

<text>Victoria, Indiana is an unincorporated community in Boon Township, Warrick County, Indiana in the United States.

==History==

Victoria was first settled as a pioneer camp in the 18th century. In the 1950s, when coal mines began to appear in Southern Indiana, woodlands in that part of the county were replaced by vast strip mines. The mines were abandoned in 1977, when coal prices dropped and the resources were exhausted. The land lay unnoticed until Newburgh grew large enough to support suburbs. Several homes were built around the now water-filled strip mines. The homes received a boost in land value when Victoria National Golf Club was built by Tom Fazio in 1996.

Victoria National Golf Club is a 21st-ranked golf club, in the U.S, and No. 1 in Indiana. There is water on 14 golf holes, because the course was once an open strip mine. On July 1, 2012, Victoria inaugurated the United Leasing Championship, a tournament on the PGA&#x27;s Nationwide Tour, garnering nationwide attention for the southwestern Indiana golf course.

<text>Earl Castle Stewart, in the County Tyrone, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1800 for Andrew Thomas Stewart, 9th Baron Castle Stuart. The current holder is Andrew Stuart, 9th Earl Castle Stewart. 

== History ==
The Earls Castle Stewart claim to be the head representatives in the pure male line of the Scottish Royal House of Stuart. They are directly descended from Sir Walter Stewart (died 1425), Keeper of Dumbarton Castle, younger son of Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany, son of Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany, younger son of King Robert II of Scotland. One of Sir Walter&#x27;s sons, Andrew Stuart, was created Lord Avandale (or Avondale) in 1459 and became Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1460 to 1482. Another son, Walter Stewart, became feudal Baron of Morphie and was legitimised in 1479. His grandson Andrew Stewart was created Lord Avondale circa 1499, a revival of the title which had become extinct on his great-uncle&#x27;s death in 1488. Andrew, Lord Avondale, was one of the many Scottish peers who were killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513.

The eldest son of Lord Avondale (killed 1513), Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Avondale, exchanged the Lordship of Avondale with Sir James Hamilton for that of Ochiltree (see the Lord Ochiltree for further history of this title) by an Act of Parliament in 1542, becoming Lord Stuart of Ochiltree. He was succeeded by his son, Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree. In turn, his son, Andrew Stuart (also spelled as Andrew Stewart), succeeded him as 3rd Lord Ochiltree and became First Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King James VI. To raise money, in 1615 he resigned the feudal barony of Ochiltree and the peerage to his first cousin, Sir James Stuart, the son of James Stewart, Earl of Arran, younger son of the second Lord Ochiltree.

In compensation for the loss of this title, in 1619 the King created the previous 3rd Lord Ochiltree the Baron Castle Stuart in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1611, he had settled in Ulster where he was granted 3,000 acres (12 km2) of land in County Tyrone. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron, Andrew Stewart (1590–1639), who one year before the death of his father had in 1628 been created a Baronet in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. The second Baron made his home at Roughan Castle and was the founder of nearby Stewartstown, County Tyrone. His eldest son, Sir Andrew Stewart 2nd Bt., became the third Baron and Governor of Fort Falkland in County Offaly fighting as a Royalist in the Civil War. He was the father of one daughter, Mary, his sole heiress. She married Henry Howard, 5th Earl of Suffolk, and the majority of the Stewart estates in Ireland were swallowed up by him. The title Baron Castle Stuart passed briefly to Sir Andrew&#x27;s brother, Josias Stewart, who died childless. On the death of the fourth Baron, his uncle the Hon. John Stewart (d.1685) succeeded to the title as the 5th Baron. After John&#x27;s death, the title was passed to his nephew, Robert Stewart (1646–1686) of Irry in County Tyrone, the eldest son of Robert Stewart, of Irry, third son of Andrew Stuart, 1st Baron Castle Stuart. The 6th Baron Castle Stuart was the father of Andrew Stewart (1672–1715), who during the wars of the Revolution was taken to Scotland. At the age of twelve, he became the rightful heir to the title 7th Baron Castle Stuart, but on returning to Ireland in adulthood he did not think it fit to claim the title as the land that had once gone with it was no longer his, having been given as a dowry to the previously mentioned Earl of Suffolk. Instead, the &quot;de jure&quot; 7th Baron made his home at Irry, which he renamed Stuart Hall, near Stewartstown, County Tyrone. His son, Robert Stewart (1700–1742) of Stuart Hall, for the same reasons as his father, chose not to become the 8th Baron Castle Stuart. After remaining dormant for 88 years the title Baron Castle Stuart was reclaimed by Andrew Thomas Stewart (1725–1809) of Stuart Hall, the eldest son of the &quot;de jure&quot; 8th Baron. He successfully petitioned the King and in 1774 became the rightful 9th Baron Castle Stuart. In 1793, he was created 1st Viscount Castle Stuart and in 1800 he was further honoured by being created the 1st Earl Castle Stewart all in the Peerage of Ireland.

Lord Castle Stewart was baptised Andrew Thomas Stewart-Moore. Moore was the maiden name of his paternal great-grandmother, Anne (Moore) Stewart, daughter of William Moore of Garvey, Garvey House and Fassaroe Castle, High Sheriff of County Tyrone, a first cousin of the 1st Earl of Clanbrassil. He only assumed the surname of Stewart by royal licence in 1775. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. His eldest son, the third Earl, died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. His only son, the fifth Earl, assumed in 1867 by royal licence the additional surname of Richardson (which was that of his father-in-law). He died without male issue and was succeeded by his first cousin, who became the sixth Earl. He was the second but eldest surviving son of Reverend the Hon. Andrew Godfrey Stuart, fourth son of the second Earl. His two elder sons were both killed in the First World War and he was therefore succeeded by his third son, the seventh Earl, in 1921. He represented Harborough in the House of Commons as a Unionist. He married in December 1920 Eleanor May Guggenheim (eldest daughter of Irene Guggenheim, &quot;née&quot; Rothschild, and Solomon R Guggenheim). They had four sons. His two elder sons were both killed in the Second World War. The titles were held by his third son, the eighth Earl, from 1961 to his death in 2023. As of November 2023, the titles are held by the 8th Earl&#x27;s son, Andrew Stuart, 9th Earl Castle Stewart. 

Another member of the Stuart/Stewart family was Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven. He was a younger son of the first Lord Avondale (of the second creation). The Earldom and Baronetcy of castle Stewart are registered with the Crown Office (now Ministry of Justice), and recorded at the College of Arms, London.

The family seat is Stuart Hall, near Stewartstown, County Tyrone.

Digby Stuart College, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Roehampton, is named also for Janet Erskine Stuart, a granddaughter of a Earl Castle Stewart.

<text>Medjugorje (, ) is a village in the municipality of Čitluk in Herzegovina-Neretva Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since 1981, it has become a popular site of Catholic pilgrimage due to Our Lady of Medjugorje, a purported series of apparitions of the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, to six local children, which some people believe are still happening to this day.

The name &quot;Međugorje&quot; literally means &quot;between mountains&quot;. At an altitude of above sea level it has a mild Mediterranean climate. The town consists of an ethnically homogeneous Croat population of 2,306. The Catholic parish includes four neighbouring villages: Bijakovići, Vionica, Miletina and Šurmanci. Since 2019, pilgrimages to Medjugorje have been authorized by the Vatican as long as there is no assumption the events are confirmed to have a supernatural origin. In September 2024, the Vatican formally endorsed &quot;prudent devotion&quot; to Mary at Medjugorje but made no declaration that the purported apparitions actually took place.

==History==

===Early history===
To the east of Međugorje in the Neretva valley, the Serbian Orthodox Žitomislić Monastery has stood since 1566. After being destroyed in 1992 by a raiding party sent from Medjugorje, it has been reconstructed. Gravestones erected in the Middle Ages have remained to this day in the Catholic cemetery &quot;Groblje Srebrenica&quot; in the hamlet of Miletina as well as in the hamlet of Vionica. In the area of the cemetery in Miletina, structures from the Roman era stood, whose ruins have not yet been fully excavated.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
Part of the Ottoman Empire until 1878, it became part of Austria-Hungary (War of 1878, Annexation 1908). In 1882 the railway line between Mostar and the Adriatic coast of Dalmatia was built, with a station in the hamlet of Šurmanci, through which the village gained access to the railway network.

The Catholic parish of &quot;Sveti Jakov&quot; (&quot;Saint James&quot;) was erected in 1892 by the Bishop of Mostar Paškal Buconjić. The twelve-metre tall crucifix on the mountain called &quot;Križevac&quot; (Cross Mountain), completing the parish&#x27;s Stations of the Cross &quot;(križni put)&quot;, was completed in 1934.

===The Medjugorje pilgrimage site===

&quot;Our Lady of Medjugorje&quot; is the title given to the apparition by those who believe that the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, has been appearing from 24 June 1981 until today to six children, now adults, in Medjugorje (then part of communist Yugoslavia). The Marian shrine of Medjugorje has become a popular pilgrimage site for Catholics, and has turned into Europe&#x27;s third most important apparition site, where each year more than 1 million people visit. It has been estimated that 30 million pilgrims have come to Međugorje since the reputed apparitions began in 1981.

In 1981 as soon as reports began of the Marian apparitions on Crnica hill in the Bijakovići hamlet, confrontations with Yugoslav state authorities began. Pilgrims were forbidden from coming, the pilgrim&#x27;s donations were seized by the police and access to what was called the &quot;Apparition Hill&quot; was largely blocked. The parish priest of Medjugorje at that time, Father Jozo Zovko, was arrested and convicted of sedition. He refused to follow the orders from the Communist Party headquarters in Mostar: to stop the people from meeting on Podrodo and to stop the evening Mass.

In the last years before the 1992 breakup of Yugoslavia, travel of pilgrims was no longer hindered by the state.

===Međugorje during the Bosnian War===
During the Bosnian War, Medjugorje remained in the hands of the Croatian Defence Council and in 1993 became part of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia. By the Dayton Agreement in 1995, Medjugorje was incorporated into the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, populated mostly by Bosniaks and Croats. It lies within the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, one of ten autonomous regions established so that no ethnic group could dominate the Federation.

On 2 April 1995, at the high point of conflict within the local diocese, Bishop Ratko Perić was kidnapped by Croat militiamen, beaten, and taken to a chapel run by one of the Franciscans associated with Međugorje, where he was held hostage for ten hours. At the initiative of the mayor of Mostar, he was freed without bloodshed, with the help of the United Nations Protection Force.

===Development after the war===

The town and its environs boomed economically after the war. Over a thousand hotel and hostel beds are available for pilgrims to the town. With approximately one million visitors annually, Medjugorje has the most overnight stays in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In 2017, Pope Francis appointed Archbishop Henryk Hoser of Praga (Warsaw) as a special envoy of the Holy See to Medjugorje, tasked with assessing its pastoral needs. By the end of 2017, Hoser had announced that the Vatican&#x27;s position was in favor of organizing pilgrimages. In 2018, the Pope named Hoser as an apostolic visitor to Medjugorje, for &quot;an undefined period and &quot;at nutum Sanctae Sedis&quot;&quot; (at the disposal of the Holy See). The aim of this mission is &quot;ensuring a stable and continuous accompaniment to the parish community of Medjugorje and to the faithful who go there as pilgrims, and whose needs require particular attention.&quot; In 2019, the Vatican officially authorized pilgrimages to Medjugorje as long as there is no assumption the events are confirmed to have a supernatural origin. The first Vatican-sanctioned pilgrimage then took place for five days from 2-6 August 2019. During the pilgrimage, approximately 60,000 young Catholics from 97 countries took part in the Medjugorje International Youth Festival. Fourteen archbishops and bishops and about 700 Catholic priests joined the festivities as well.

On September 19 2024, Vatican City, with the blessing of Pope Francis, granted Medjugorje the status of &#x27;Nulla Osta&#x27; (Nihil Obstat). This means that they encourage the departure of believers and church pilgrimages to Medjugorje, but do not enter into the question of alleged Marian apparitions, and warn believers not to go to Medjugorje for &#x27;alleged seers&#x27;, but for the Queen of Peace, or in other words Vatican City offers its approval for devotion of Queen of Peace and Medjugorje.

The Vatican&#x27;s document stated that the ruling was made because “many positive fruits have been noted in the midst of a spiritual experience, while negative and dangerous effects have not spread among the People of God.”

== Demographics ==
According to the 2013 census, its population was 2,265.

<text>Star Maker is a science fiction novel by British writer Olaf Stapledon, published in 1937. Continuing the theme of the author&#x27;s previous book, &quot;Last and First Men&quot; (1930)—which narrated a history of the human species over two billion years—it describes a history of life in the universe, dwarfing the scale of the earlier work. &quot;Star Maker&quot; tackles philosophical themes such as the essence of life, of birth, decay and death, and the relationship between creation and creator. A pervading theme is that of progressive unity within and between different civilisations.

Some of the elements and themes briefly discussed prefigure later fiction concerning genetic engineering and alien life forms. Arthur C. Clarke considered &quot;Star Maker&quot; to be &quot;probably the most powerful work of imagination ever written&quot;, and Brian W. Aldiss called it &quot;the one great grey holy book of science fiction&quot;.

==Plot==
A human narrator from England is transported out of his body via unexplained means. He realises he is able to explore space and other planets. After exploring in some detail a civilisation on another planet in our galaxy, at a level of development similar to our own that existed millions of years ago, thousands of light years from Earth (the &quot;Other Earth&quot;), his mind merges with that of one of its inhabitants. As they travel together, they are joined by still more minds or group-minds. This snowballing process is parallelled by the expansion of the book&#x27;s scale, describing more and more planets in less and less detail.

The disembodied travellers encounter many ideas that are interesting from both science-fictional and philosophical points of view. These include many imaginative descriptions of species, civilisations and methods of warfare, descriptions of the multiverse, and the idea that the stars and pre-galactic nebulae are intelligent beings, operating on vast time scales. A key idea is the formation of collective minds from many telepathically-linked individuals, on the level of planets, galaxies, and eventually the cosmos itself.

A symbiotic species, each individual composed of two species, both non-humanoid, is discussed in detail. Normally detached from the galaxy&#x27;s turmoil, they intervene in a deus ex machina to end the threat of a civilisation dedicated to forcing its mentality onto one stellar civilisation after another.

The climax of the book is the &quot;supreme moment of the cosmos&quot;, when the cosmic mind (which includes the narrator) attains momentary contact with the titular &quot;Star Maker&quot;. The Star Maker is the creator of the universe, but stands in the same relation to it as an artist to his work, and calmly assesses its quality without any feeling for the suffering of its inhabitants. This element makes the novel one of Stapledon&#x27;s efforts to write &quot;an essay in myth making&quot;.

After meeting the Star Maker, the traveller is given a &quot;fantastic myth or dream&quot; in which he observes the Star Maker at work. He discovers that his own cosmos is only one of a vast number, and by no means the most significant. He sees the Star Maker&#x27;s early work, and he learns that the Star Maker was surprised and intensely interested when some of his early &quot;toy&quot; universes (for example, a universe composed entirely of music with no spatial dimensions) displayed &quot;modes of behaviour that were not in accord with the canon which he had ordained for them&quot;. He sees the Star Maker experimenting with more elaborate universes, which include the traveller&#x27;s own universe; a triune universe which closely resembles &quot;Christian orthodoxy&quot; (the three universes respectively being hell, heaven, and reality with presence of a saviour); and a branching universe similar to that of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Star Maker goes on to create &quot;mature&quot; universes of extraordinary complexity, culminating in an &quot;ultimate cosmos&quot;, through which the Star Maker fulfills his own eternal destiny as &quot;the ground and crown of all things&quot;. Finally, the traveller returns to Earth at the place and time he left, to resume his life there.

==Reception==

The novel is one of the most highly acclaimed novels in science fiction. On publication, &quot;Star Maker&quot; received admiring reviews from L. P. Hartley, Bertrand Russell and Howard Spring. After the publication of &quot;Star Maker&quot;, both Virginia Woolf and C. E. M. Joad wrote letters to Stapledon praising the book. Its admirers at the time of first publication saw it as one of the most brilliant, inventive, and daring science fiction books. Among its more famous admirers were H. G. Wells, Jorge Luis Borges, Brian Aldiss, Doris Lessing, and Stanisław Lem. Borges wrote a prologue for a 1965 edition and called it &quot;a prodigious novel&quot;. Lessing wrote an afterword for a UK edition. Freeman Dyson was also a fan, admitting to basing his concept of Dyson spheres on a section of the book, even calling &quot;Stapledon sphere&quot; a better name for the idea. Among science fiction writers, Arthur C. Clarke has been most strongly influenced by Stapledon.

Some of Stapledon&#x27;s contemporaries were appalled at the book&#x27;s philosophy: in a letter to Arthur C. Clarke in 1943, C. S. Lewis described the ending as &quot;sheer devil worship&quot;. Simon Blumenfeld in the August 1937 issue of the &quot;Left Review&quot; also gave the novel a negative review. Blumenfeld said that Stapledon was one of a group of &quot;utopia-mongers&quot; who were uninterested in the contemporary world and its problems.

==In popular culture==
It is referenced by Nancy Bellicec (Veronica Cartwright) as &quot;must reading&quot; in the 1978 version of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;.

<text>Armando N. Almanza (born October 26, 1972) is an American former left-handed relief pitcher, who last played for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB). He also played for the Florida Marlins and the Atlanta Braves. He was a hard-thrower, with a fastball in the mid-90s and a big, slow curveball, but had issues with his control his entire career. He was 6&quot;3 and weighed approximately 240 pounds.

==Career==
After attending Bel Air High School in his native El Paso, Texas, and then pitching for New Mexico Junior College, Almanza was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 21st round of the 1993 MLB draft. Almanza pitched at the Rookie level in 1993 and missed the entire 1994 season, undergoing surgery to repair a ligament tear in his pitching elbow. He remained in the Cardinals minor league system until they traded him to the Florida Marlins after the 1998 season.

Going into the 1999 season, Almanza was expected to pitch at the Triple-A level with a chance to make the Marlins roster. However, he did not pitch well in spring training or early in the regular season, and he ended up with the Marlins&#x27; Double-A affiliate, the Portland Sea Dogs. However, after a short stint in Portland, Almanza was promoted directly from Double-A to the major leagues.

Almanza was still with the Florida Marlins when they upset the New York Yankees in the 2003 World Series. Almanza, however, did not get to participate in postseason play, as he had undergone season-ending arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow that August. The Marlins released Almanza in December 2003, and he was signed by the Atlanta Braves two days later.

Almanza&#x27;s 2004 contract in Atlanta paid him a base salary of $500,000 with incentives that could have bumped up his earnings to $1.1 million, including a clause worth $100,000 if he stayed on the Braves active roster through the end of the season. Almanza played mostly in the minor leagues in 2004 and 2005, which were his last two seasons in professional baseball. He appeared in 13 games for the Braves in 2004 and 6 games for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2005.

<doc id="355173" wikidata="Q464237" url="?curid=355173" title="Amhara people">
<text>Amharas (; ) are a Semitic-speaking ethnic group indigenous to Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa, traditionally inhabiting parts of the northwest Highlands of Ethiopia, particularly the Amhara Region.

According to the 2007 national census, Amharas numbered 19,867,817 individuals, comprising 26.9% of Ethiopia&#x27;s population, and they are mostly Oriental Orthodox Christian (members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church).

They are also found within the Ethiopian expatriate community, particularly in North America. They speak Amharic, a Semitic language of the Afro-Asiatic branch which serves as the main and one of the five official languages of Ethiopia. As of 2018, Amharic has over 32 million native speakers and 25 million second language speakers.

The Amhara and neighboring groups in North and Central Ethiopia and Eritrea, more specifically the diaspora refer to themselves as &quot;Habesha&quot; (Abyssinian) people.

Historically, the Amhara held significant political position in the Ethiopian Empire. They were the origin of the Solomonic dynasty and all the emperors of Ethiopia were Amhara with the exception of Yohannes IV since the restoration of the dynasty in 1270.

==Origin==
The earliest extants of the Amhara as a people, dates to the early 12th century in the middle of the Zagwe Dynasty, when the Amhara were recorded of being in conflict in the &quot;land of Wärjih&quot; in 1128 AD.

Another early reference of the Amhara comes from the mid 12th century source by Umara al-Yamani, where he explicitly mentions that one of the rulers of the Najahid Dynasty belonged to the &quot;tribe of Amhara&quot;. A non-contemporary 13th or 14th century hagiographical source from Saint Tekle Haymanot traces Amhara even further back to the mid 9th century AD as a location.

===Ethnogenesis===
Amharic is a South Ethio-Semitic language, along with Gurage, Argobba and others. Some time before the 1st century AD, the North and South branches of Ethio-Semitic diverged. Due to the social stratification of the time, the Cushitic Agaw adopted the South Semitic language and mixed with the Semitic population. Amharic thus developed with a Cushitic substratum and a Semitic superstratum. The proto-Amhara, or the northernmost South Ethio-Semitic speakers, remained in constant contact with their North Ethio-Semitic neighbors, evidenced by linguistic analysis and oral traditions. A 7th century southward shift of the center of gravity of the Kingdom of Aksum and the ensuing integration and Christianization of the proto-Amhara also resulted in a high prevalence of Geʽez sourced lexicon in Amharic. By about the 9th century AD, there was a linguistically distinct ethnic group called the Amhara in the area of Bete Amhara.

===Etymology===
The origin of the Amhara name is debated. A popular Folk etymology traces it to &quot;amari&quot; (&quot;pleasing; beautiful; gracious&quot;) or &quot;mehare&quot; (&quot;gracious&quot;). Another popular etymology claims that it derives from Ge&#x27;ez (&quot;ʿam&quot;, &quot;people&quot;) and (&quot;ḥara&quot;, &quot;free&quot; or &quot;soldier&quot;).

==History==

&quot;Amhara&quot; was historically a medieval province located in the modern province of Wollo (Bete Amhara), the area which is now known as the Amhara Region was composed of several provinces which had little or no autonomy, these provinces included Dembiya, Begemder, Gojjam, Wollo, Lasta, Shewa, Semien, Angot and Wag.

Evidence of a traceable Christian Aksumite presence in Amhara dates back to at least the 9th century AD, when the Istifanos monastery was erected on Lake Hayq. Several other sites and monuments indicate the presence of similar Axumite influences in the area, such as the Geta Lion statues, which are located 10 km south of Kombolcha, and are believed to date back to the 3rd century AD, though they may even date back to pre-Axumite times.

In 1998, ancient pieces of pottery were found around tombs in Atatiya in Southern Wollo, in Habru which is located to the south-east of Hayq, as well as to the north-east of Ancharo (Chiqa Beret). The decorations and symbols which are inscribed on the pottery substantiate the expansion of Aksumite civilization to the south of Angot.

According to Karl Butzer &quot;By 800, Axum had almost ceased to exist, and its demographic resources were barely adequate to stop the once tributary pastoralists of the border marches from pillaging the defenseless countryside.&quot; With some of the common people the Axumite elite abandoned Axum in favor of central Ethiopia. Christian families gradually migrated southward into Amhara and northern Shewa. Population movement from the old provinces in the north into more fertile areas in the south seems to have been connected to the southward shift of the kingdom.

The Christianization of Amhara is believed to have begun somewhere during the Aksumite period. The political importance of Amhara further increased after the fall of Aksum, which marked the shift of the political center of the Christian Ethiopian state from Aksum in the north to the Zagwe region of Lasta further inland.

The Amhara nobles supported the Zagwe dynasty prince Lalibela in his power struggle against his brothers which led him to make Amharic &quot;Lessana Negus&quot; (lit. &quot;language of the king&quot;) as well as fill the Amhara nobles in the top positions of his Kingdom.

=== Solomonic Dynasty ===

Yekuno Amlak, a prince from Bete Amhara (lit: House of Amhara) claimed descent from Solomon, and established the Solomonic Dynasty in 1270 AD. The early rulers of the Solomonic Dynasty may have been referred to as the &quot;kings of &quot;Amhara&quot;&quot;, due to the origin of their founder, Yekuno Amlak, and therefore, their followers were called &quot;Amhara&quot; and brought this new name with them when they conquered new lands. Characterized by a Christian feudal culture, and by the adoption of Amharic, which from became the &quot;lingua franca&quot;. This population of a rather small province became the dominant group in the empire.

Around this time, Medieval Arab historians state that Christian Ethiopia was under the sovereignty of &quot;the Lord of Amhara&quot; which confirms that the new Solomonic dynasty appears to be stock of the Bete Amhara in the eyes of the contemporary. The Egyptian historian al-Mufaddal ibn Abi al-Fada&#x27;il in 704 Hijri (1304-1305 AD) labelled the Emperor of Abyssinia as &quot;al-Malik al-Amhari&quot; or &quot;the Amhara King&quot;. In 1436 Ibn Taghribirdi wrote a passage about the death of Emperor Yeshaq referring to him as the Lord of Amhara, &quot;The Hatse, the Abyssinian king, the infidel and the Lord of the Amhara in Abyssinia died (in this year). His estates were much enlarged after wars waged and led by him against Sultan Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din, the Lord of the Jabarta.&quot;

The cultural contact and interaction between the Amhara and the indigenous Agaw accelerated after the 14th century. As the Agaw adopted the Amharic language and converted to Orthodox Christianity, they increasingly succumbed to Amhara acculturation. Other
South Semitic speakers like the Gafat and Argobba in Shewa also began to adopt Amharic and assimilate into Amhara society. By the end of the 16th century, the populations of Gojjam, Lasta and Begemder were almost completely made up of Christian Amharic speakers.

Despite every work on Ethiopia stressing the political dominance of the Amhara people in the history of the Ethiopian Christian empire. In both Christian and Muslim written traditions up to the 19th century, and in the Ethiopian chronicles of the 14th to 18th centuries, the term &quot;Amhara&quot; is a region, not an ethnonym. In pre-17th century Ethiopia, Amhara was described as the heartland of the Empire and the cradle of the monarchy. Medieval European maps suggest that within the Ethiopian Empire, Amhara had a higher position as a &quot;kingdom&quot; among provinces. The Italian (Venetian) cartographer Fra Mauro, notes a &quot;Regno Hamara&quot; or &quot;Kingdom of Amhara&quot; in his famous &quot;Mappomondo&quot; in 1460. Important information on Amhara is provided in the &quot;Historia Aethiopica&quot; by Hiob Ludolf, the data of which came from Abba Gorgoryos, himself a native of Amhara. On the map of &quot;Historia Aethiopica&quot;, Amhara is situated between the Abay River to the west, the Bashilo River in the north, the Afar Depression to the east and the Awash River to the south. The province consisted of much of Wollo and northern Shewa, and encompassed the region of Lake Hayq and the famous Istifanos Monastery.

The Amhara monarchs moved continuously from region to region living in katamas, showing a particular preference for the southernly regions of Ifat, Shewa and Dawaro until the political upheavals of the 16th century, after which the province of Begemder became home for the city of Gondar, royal capital for the Ethiopian polity from the 1630s to the mid-19th century. Within the broader territory of Amharic speakers, certain regions developed into autonomous political centers. To the south, beyond Lake Tana, the province of Gojjam developed a dynasty of rulers and became a powerful kingdom within the Ethiopian Empire. The district of Menz in Shewa became the center for the development of a political dynasty culminating in King Sahle Selassie, Emperor Menelik II and Emperor Haile Selassie.

Through their control of the political center of Ethiopian society and via assimilation, conquests, and intermarriages, the Amhara have spread their language and many customs well beyond the borders of their primary homeland in Bete Amhara. This expansion served as a cohesive force, binding together the disparate elements of the larger Ethiopian polity. This cohesion proved crucial for the Ethiopian state as it engaged in the process of modern nation-building in the 19th century, thereby preserving its independence against potential threats from European colonial powers. Additionally, it facilitated various modernizing initiatives, including the abolition of the slave trade, the implementation of new communication and transportation systems, the establishment of schools and hospitals, and the creation of modern government institutions.

== Social stratification ==
Within traditional Amharic society and that of other local Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations, there were four basic strata. According to the Donald Levine, these consisted of high-ranking clans, low-ranking clans, caste groups (artisans), and slaves. Slaves or rather servants were at the bottom of the hierarchy, and were primarily drawn from the pagan Nilotic Shanqella and Oromo peoples.

Also known as the &quot;barya&quot; (meaning &quot;slave&quot; in Amharic), they were captured during slave raids in Ethiopia&#x27;s southern hinterland. War captives were another source of slaves, but the perception, treatment and duties of these prisoners was markedly different. According to Levine, the widespread slavery in Greater Ethiopia formally ended in the 1930s, but former slaves, their offspring, and de facto slaves continued to hold similar positions in the social hierarchy.

The separate Amhara caste system of people ranked higher than slaves was based on the following concepts: (1) endogamy, (2) hierarchical status, (3) restraints on commensality, (4) pollution concepts, (5) traditional occupation, and (6) inherited caste membership. Scholars accept that there has been a rigid, endogamous and occupationally closed social stratification among the Amharas and other Afro-Asiatic-speaking Ethiopian ethnic groups. Some label it as an economically closed, endogamous class system with occupational minorities, whereas others such as David Todd assert that this system can be unequivocally labelled as caste-based.

==Language==

The Amhara speak &quot;&quot;Amharic&quot; (&quot;Amarigna&quot;, &quot;Amarinya&quot;&quot;) as their mother tongue. Its native speakers account for 29.3% of the Ethiopian population. It belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, and is the largest member of the Ethiopian Semitic group. As of 2018 it had more than 57 million speakers worldwide (32,345,260 native speakers plus 25,100,000 second language speakers), making it the most commonly-spoken language in Ethiopia in terms of first- and second-language speakers, and the second most spoken Semitic language after Arabic.

Most of the Ethiopian Jewish communities in Ethiopia and Israel speak Amharic. Many followers of the Rastafari movement learn Amharic as a second language, as they consider it to be a sacred language.

Amharic is the working language of the federal authorities of the Ethiopian government, and one of the five official languages of Ethiopia. It was for some time also the sole language of primary school instruction, but has been replaced in many areas by regional languages such as Oromo and Tigrinya. Nevertheless, Amharic is still widely used as the working language of Amhara Region, Benishangul-Gumuz Region, Gambela Region and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples&#x27; Region. The Amharic language is transcribed using a script (&quot;Fidal&quot;) which is slightly modified from the Ethiopic or Ge&#x27;ez script, an abugida.

==Religion==
For centuries, the predominant religion of the Amhara has been Christianity, with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church playing a central role in the culture of the country. According to the 2007 census, 82.5% of the population of the Amhara Region was Ethiopian Orthodox; 17.2% of it was Muslim, 0.2% of it was Protestant (see P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay) and 0.5% of it was Jewish (see Beta Israel).

The Ethiopian Orthodox Church maintains close links with the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Easter and Epiphany are the most important celebrations, marked with services, feasting and dancing. There are also many feast days throughout the year, when only vegetables or fish may be eaten.
Marriages are often arranged, with men marrying in their late teens or early twenties. Traditionally, girls were married as young as 14, but in the 20th century, the minimum age was raised to 18, and this was enforced by the Imperial government. After a church wedding, divorce is frowned upon. Each family hosts a separate wedding feast after the wedding.

Upon childbirth, a priest will visit the family to bless the infant. The mother and child remain in the house for 40 days after birth for physical and emotional strength. The infant will be taken to the church for baptism at 40 days (for boys) or 80 days (for girls).

==Culture==
=== Literature ===
Surviving Amharic literary works dates back to the 14th century, when songs and poems were composed. In the 17th century Amharic became the first African language to be translated into Latin when Ethiopian priest and lexicographer Abba Gorgoryos (1595–1658) in 1652 AD made a European voyage to Thuringia in Germany. Gorgoryos along with his colleague and friend Hiob Ludolf co-authored the earliest grammar book of the Amharic language, an Amharic-Latin dictionary, as well as contributing to Ludolf&#x27;s book &quot;A History of Ethiopia&quot;.

Modern literature in Amharic however, started two centuries later than in Europe, with the Amharic fiction novel &quot;Ləbb Wälläd Tarik&quot;, published in Rome in 1908, widely considered the first novel in Amharic, by Afäwarq Gäbrä Iyäsus. Amhara intellectual Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam pioneered African and Ethiopian theatre when he authored , Africa&#x27;s first scripted play. Since then countless literature in Amharic has been published and many modern-day writers in Amharic translate their work into English for commercial reasons.

=== Music ===
Up until the mid 20th century, Amharic music consisted mainly of religious and secular folk songs and dances. 
&quot;Qañat&quot; Amhara secular folk music developed in the countryside through the use of traditionel instruments such as the &quot;:masenqo&quot;, a one-string bowed :lute; the &quot;:krar&quot;, a six-string :lyre; and the &quot;washint&quot; flute played by the local village musicians called the Azmaris, and the peasantry dancing the &quot;Eskista&quot;; the most well known Amharan folk dance. 
The &quot;:begena&quot;, a large ten-string lyre; is an important instrument solely devoted to the spiritual part of Amhara music. Other instruments includes the &quot;Meleket&quot; wind instrument, and the &quot;Kebero&quot; and &quot;Negarit&quot; drums.

From the 1950s onward foreign influence i.e. foreign educated Ethiopians and the availability of larger quantities of new instruments led to new genre&#x27;s of Amharic music and ushered in the 1960s and 1970s Golden Age of Ethiopian music. The popular Ethio-Jazz genre pioneered by Mulatu Astatke was created from the &quot;Tizita&quot; qañat of the Amhara combined with the use of Western instruments. Saxophone legend Getatchew Mekurya instrumentalized the Amhara war cry &quot;Shellela&quot; into an genre in the 1950s before joining the Ethio-Jazz scene later in his career. Other Amharic artists from the &quot;Golden age&quot; such as Asnaketch Worku, Bahru Kegne, Kassa Tessema and Mary Armede were renowned for their mastery of traditionel instruments.

The political turmoil during the Derg regime (1974-1991) led to censorship of music; night life came to a standstill through government imposed curfews and the curbing of musical performances. Notable Ethiopian musicians were jailed including those of Amhara descent such as Ayalew Mesfin and Telela Kebede. A revival of &quot;Qene&quot;; Amharic poetic songs which uses double entendre known as &quot;sam-enna warq&quot; (&quot;wax and gold&quot;) was used for subversive dialogue and resistance to state censorship. Thousands of Ethiopians including musicians migrated during this period to form communities in different countries.

Amharic songs of resistance against the autocratic EPRDF regime led by the TPLF (1991-2018) continued; with prevailing themes being rampant corruption, economic favoritism, excessive emphasis on ethnic identity and its ability to undermine national unity. Amharic musicians; such as Getish Mamo, Nhatty Man, Teddy Afro and others turned to the old tradition of &quot;sam-enna warq&quot; and used layered expression to evade skirt stringent censorship and oppressive laws (such as the anti-terror law) while reminding the people of their similarities and the importance of maintaining solidarity.

In June 2022 Teddy Afro bashed Abiy Ahmed and his regime in a critical new song (Na&#x27;et), following the Gimbi massacre. In his song he tries to vent the suppressed public anger and indignation, the swelling public resentment to the chaos in the country.

===Art===

Amhara art is typified by religious paintings. One of the notable features of these is the large eyes of the subjects, who are usually biblical figures. It is usually oil on canvas or hide, some surviving from the Middle Ages. The Amhara art includes weaved products embellished with embroidery. Works in gold and silver exist in the form of filigree jewelry and religious emblems.

===Kinship and marriage===
The Amhara culture recognizes kinship, but unlike other ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa region, it has a lesser role. Household relationships are primary, and the major economic, political and cultural functions are not based on kin relationships among the Amharas. Rather abilities of the individual matter. For example, states Donald Levine, the influence of clergy among the Amhara has been based on &quot;ritual purity, doctrinal knowledge, ability to perform miracles and capacity to provide moral guidance&quot;. The social relationships in the Amhara culture are predominantly based on hierarchical patterns and individualistic associations.

Family and kin relatives are often involved in arranging &quot;semanya&quot; (eighty bond marriage, also called &quot;kal kidan&quot;), which has been most common and allows divorce. Other forms of marriage include &quot;qurban&quot;, which is solemnized in church, where divorce is forbidden, and usually observed among the orthodox priests. Patrilineal descent is the norm. While the wife had no inheritance rights, in case a child was conceived during the temporary &quot;damoz&quot; marriage, the child could make a claim a part of the father&#x27;s property.

===Cuisine===
Amhara cuisine consists of various vegetable or spicy meat side dishes and entrées, usually a wat, or thick stew, served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread made of teff flour in the shape of pancakes usually of about 30 to 45 cm in diameter. When eating traditional injera dishes in groups, it&#x27;s normally it eaten from a mesob (shared food basket), with each person breaking off pieces of injera flatbread using only the right hand, from the side nearest them and dipping it into stew in the center of the basket. There is also a great variety of vegetarian stews such as lentils, ground split peas, grains, accompanied by injera and/or bread.

Amharas adhering to any of the Abrahmic religions do not eat pork or shellfish of any kind for religious reasons. Amhara Orthodox Christians do not consume meat and dairy products (i.e. egg, butter, milk, and cheese) during specific fasting periods, and on every Wednesdays and Fridays except the 50 days between Easter and Pentecost. On all other days meat and dairy products are allowed. A variety of vegan dishes are consumed during fasting periods.

Ethiopia is a Buna (coffee) exporter, but also has a very large domestic consumer base. During social gatherings Amharas drink Buna in a unique and traditional way known as a coffee ceremony. First the coffee is roasted, then ground and placed in a Jebena (coffee pot) with boiling water. When ready it is then served to people in little cups, up to three times per ceremony.

The ceremony is typically performed by the woman of the household, or the female host and is considered an honor. Amhara women dress up for the occasion in a kemis, a traditional dress. Other locally produced beverages are tella (beer) and tej (honey wine), which are served and drunk on major religious festivals, Saints Days and weddings.

==Nature of Amhara ethnicity==

Mackonen Michael (2008) noted that the Amhara identity is claimed to be composed of multiple ethnicities by some, whereas others &quot;reject this concept and argue that Amhara exists as a distinctive ethnic group with a specific located boundary&quot;. He further noted that &quot;although people from the Ethiopian highland areas think of themselves as Amharas, the Northern Shoans specifically call themselves Amhara. That is why the Oromo and Tigrian discourse associate the Northern Shoans as oppressive-Amharas.&quot;

According to Gideon P. E. Cohen, writing in 2000, there is some debate about &quot;whether the Amhara can legitimately be regarded as an ethnic group, [...] given their distribution throughout Ethiopia, and the incorporative capacity of the group that has led to the inclusion of individuals from a wide range of ethnic or linguistic backgrounds&quot;. Similarly, Tezera Tazebew notes that &quot;the early 1990s was marked by debates, both popular and scholarly, on the (non-)existence of Amhara as a distinct ethnic group&quot;, giving the debate between the academic Mesfin Woldemariam and president of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia Meles Zenawi in July 1991 as an example.

Due to large amounts of assimilation into the northern Amhara culture after Ethiopian imperial expansion, Siegfried Pausewang concluded in 2005 that &quot;the term Amhara relates in contemporary Ethiopia to two different and distinct social groups. The ethnic group of the Amhara, mostly a peasant population, is different from a mixed group of urban people coming from different ethnic background, who have adopted Amharic as a common language and identify themselves as Ethiopians&quot;.

In a 2017 article, historian Brian J. Yates notes that some &quot;scholars and politicians have attempted to sketch out what an Amhara is, but there are considerable divergences on the nature of this identity. Some argue that it is a cultural identity; however, much of the scholarship indicates that it is solely a class-based identity, devoid of ethnicity&quot;.

Solomon Gashaw asserts that &quot;there is no intra-Amhara ethnic consciousness, except among northern settlers in southern Ethiopia&quot;. He notes that most Amharic-speaking people identify by their place of birth. He asks, &quot;what is Amhara domination?&quot;, answering: &quot;It is a linguistic and cultural domination by a multi-ethnic group who speak Amharic&quot;.

Writing in 1998, Tegegne Teka wrote that &quot;the Amhara do not possess what people usually refer to as objective ethnic markers: common ancestry, territory, religion and shared experience except the language. The Amhara have no claims to a common ancestry. They do not share the same sentiments and they have no mutual interests based on shared understandings. It is, therefore, difficult to conclude that the Amhara belong to an ethnic group. But this does not mean that there is no Amhara identity&quot;.

According to ethnographer Donald Levine, writing in 2003 and citing Christopher Clapham, &quot;Only in the last quarter of the 20th cent. has the term [Amhara] come to be a common ethnic appellation, comparable to the way in which Oromo has become generalized
to cover peoples who long knew themselves primarily as Boorana (Boräna), Guğği, Mäč̣č̣a and the like. Even so, Amharic-speaking Šäwans still feel themselves closer to non-Amharic-speaking Šäwans than to Amharic-speakers from distant regions like Gondär and there are few members of the Šäwan nobility who do not have Oromo genealogical links&quot;. According to Takkele Taddese, Amharic-speakers tend to be a &quot;supra-ethnic group&quot; composed of &quot;fused stock&quot;. Taddese describes the Amhara as follows:

The Amhara can thus be said to exist in the sense of being a fused stock, a supra-ethnically conscious ethnic Ethiopian serving as the pot in which all the other ethnic groups are supposed to melt. The language, Amharic, serves as the center of this melting process although it is difficult to conceive of a language without the existence of a corresponding distinct ethnic group speaking it as a mother tongue. The Amhara does not exist, however, in the sense of being a distinct ethnic group promoting its own interests and advancing the Herrenvolk philosophy and ideology as has been presented by the elite politicians. The basic principle of those who affirm the existence of the Amhara as a distinct ethnic group, therefore, is that the Amhara should be dislodged from the position of supremacy and each ethnic group should be freed from Amhara domination to have equal status with everybody else. This sense of Amhara existence can be viewed as a myth.

===Ethnic consciousness in the past===
In the 17th century, Abyssinian traveler Abba Gorgoryos states the following in a letter to his German friend Hiob Ludolf:
As to my origins, do not imagine, my friend, that they are humble, for I am of the House of Amhara which is a respected tribe; from it come the heads of the Ethiopian people, the governors, the military commanders, the judges and the advisers of the King of Ethiopia who appoint and dismiss, command and rule in the name of the King, his governors, and grandees. &quot;

On March 28, 1898, near Lake Rudolf, a first-hand account of Russian officer, Alexander Bulatovich, detailing hostile exchange of words between the Turkana people and Welde Giyorgis Aboye&#x27;s forces, where Bulatovich was attached to as an advisor to the Ras.

=== The rise of ethnic consciousness and nationalism ===
Zola Moges notes the emergence of Amhara nationalism and ethnic consciousness with origins in the early 1990s but taking clearer shape with the establishment of the National Movement of Amhara in 2018 along with the rise of Fano ethnic militias in the 2010s. Moges writes that a &quot;younger generation has adopted its &#x27;Amharaness&#x27;; but most ordinary people are yet to fully embrace it, not least because of the lack of any effectively articulated ideological foundation or priorities and the absence of any &#x27;tailor-made&#x27; solutions to the challenges facing them&quot;.

Amanuel Tesfaye writes that: &quot;While the older Amhara population still detest ethnic identification and ethnic forms of political organization, preferring pan-Ethiopian nationalism, the young have no problem pronouncing their Amhara identity, advocating for the protection and advancement of the rights and interests of their ethnic kin within the framework of the multi-nation state, and organizing politically along that particular ethnic identity&quot;.

=== Amhara nationalism in the 2020&#x27;s ===
Amhara nationalism, which was once seen as taboo, exploded during the Tigray War. Civilian&#x27;s from the Amhara and Agew ethnic groups took up arms to defend the region from the TPLF rebel groups and take back the contested lands of Welkait-Tegede and Raya Azebo which were forcefully annexed and ethnically cleansed into Tigray by the TPLF in 1991. The joint militias from Wollo, Gojjam, Gonder, and Shewa unified as one under the name of Fano. Mistrust between the Amhara people and Abiy Ahmed&#x27;s Prosperity Party heightened when Abiy Ahmed made the surprise decision to retreat from Tigray on July 1, 2021, leading to the TPLF aligned Tigray Defense Forces marching thorough cities in North Gonder, North Wollo, and Wag Hemra causing mass rape and destruction.

The Ethiopian National Defense Forces further severed their relationship with the Amhara Fano when they forced the Fano to disarm after the end of the Tigray war resulting in the beginning of the Amhara War in April 2023.

Wide spread attacks and mob killings of Amhara women and children by the Oromo Liberation Army and aligned Oromo nationalist groups in Oromia, specifically Wollega, for the past four decades has caused widespread outrage around the Amhara region. This wave of violence has led to more Amharas turning towards Amhara nationalism to seek to equality for their identity and an end to the systematic marginalization of their people.

==Genetics==

===Autosomal ancestry===
Research shows that Amharas have a mixture of a type of native African ancestry unique and autochthonous to the Horn of Africa, as well as ancestry originating from a non-African back-migration.

Studies comparing blood oxygenation in Amharas to nearby lowlands populations, and to the Andeans and Tibetans showed unique adaptations to living in a high altitude environment.

===Uniparental lineages===
Haplogroup E1b1b was found at 35.4% among the 48 sampled Amhara in a study. However, other studies have found an almost equal representation of E1b1b at approximately 57% in both the 25 Oromo and the 34 Amhara individuals. The second most prevalent lineage Haplogroup J, has been found to exist at levels as high as 35.4% in the Amhara, of which 33.3% is of the type J1, while 2.1% is of J2 type.

<doc id="355180" wikidata="Q274354" url="?curid=355180" title="Flossenbürg concentration camp">
<text>Flossenbürg was a Nazi concentration camp built in May 1938 by the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office. Unlike other concentration camps, it was located in a remote area, in the Fichtel Mountains of Bavaria, adjacent to the town of Flossenbürg and near the German border with Czechoslovakia. The camp&#x27;s initial purpose was to exploit the forced labor of prisoners for the production of granite for Nazi architecture. In 1943, the bulk of prisoners switched to producing Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter planes and other armaments for Germany&#x27;s war effort. Although originally intended for &quot;criminal&quot; and &quot;asocial&quot; prisoners, after Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union, the camp&#x27;s numbers swelled with political prisoners from outside Germany. It also developed an extensive subcamp system that eventually outgrew the main camp.

Before it was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945, 89,964 to 100,000 prisoners passed through Flossenbürg and its subcamps. Around 30,000 died from malnutrition, overwork, executions, or during the death marches. Some of those responsible for these deaths, including administrators, guards, and others, were tried and convicted in the Flossenbürg trial. The camp was repurposed for other uses before the opening of a memorial and museum in 2007.

==Background ==

During the first half of 1938, the Nazi concentration camp population expanded threefold due to increased arrests by the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) of individuals deemed undesirable, especially &quot;asocial&quot; and &quot;criminal&quot; prisoners, to create a slave labor force. SS leader Heinrich Himmler ordered the founding of new concentration camps to expand the SS economic empire. The SS intended to exploit the slave labor of prisoners to quarry granite, which was in high demand for monumental building projects in the Nazi style. This would also profit the SS-owned and -operated company German Earth and Stone Works (DEST), which had been founded in April.

During the second half of March 1938, a high-ranking SS commission led by Oswald Pohl and Theodor Eicke toured southern Germany, searching for a site for a new camp that would meet the SS&#x27; specifications. On 24 March 1938, they chose a site near the small town of Flossenbürg, in the Upper Palatinate, for the establishment of a concentration camp due to the quarries of blue-gray granite located nearby. Unlike all other Nazi concentration camps to date, which were near rail junctions and population centers, the camp was to be located in the remote Upper Palatine Forest near , formerly owned by Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa.

Flossenbürg was a poor rural area, with about 1,200 inhabitants who mostly worked on the quarries, which had existed since the 19th century. The local economy, especially the stone industry, was negatively impacted by the new border with Czechoslovakia after the Treaty of Versailles and the 1930s economic slump. Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power increased the demand for granite, earning the Nazi Party local support. The construction of the camp was funded by a contract with Albert Speer&#x27;s ministry for the reconstruction of Berlin; it was the first occasion that economic considerations had determined the site of a camp.

==Establishment==
The order for the construction of eight barracks at Flossenbürg went through on 31 March, SS guards arrived in April, and on 3 May 1938, a transport of 100 prisoners arrived from Dachau, establishing the camp. More prisoners arrived from Dachau on 9 and 16 May; Himmler visited the camp on 16 May with Pohl, indicating that the SS considered it an important project. The SS attempted to segregate prisoners incarcerated for criminal offences at Flossenbürg because forced labor in the quarries was considered a particularly harsh punishment. Most of the prisoners at Flossenbürg were classified as criminal, with some &quot;asocial&quot; and a few homosexual prisoners; the criminals quickly took over the prisoner functionary positions.

The new prisoners had to construct the camp themselves, beginning with the barbed wire fence; this was initially the main use of forced labor. While performing this heavy and dangerous work, the prisoners lived in makeshift structures. Simultaneously, hundreds of prisoners had to work in the quarries. The camp&#x27;s population had increased to 1,500 following arrivals from Dachau, Sachsenhausen, and Buchenwald. In January 1939, the first commandant, Jakob Weiseborn, unexpectedly died. He was replaced by a former SS officer at Dachau, Karl Künstler, who presided over an era in which the camp became an economically productive center for granite quarrying, and increasingly deadly for its prisoners. With the first barracks complete, in 1939 work began on an internal jail, guard towers, a washing facility, and a sewer system. In April 1939, the economic productivity of the camp led to Pohl ordering the camp to be expanded to fit 3,000 prisoners. To build additional barracks, terraces had to be cut into the hillsides, an arduous task that led to many injuries.

Fifty-five prisoners died before the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. During mid-1939, Nazi authorities planned to invade Poland. It was decided to stage false flag attacks in order to justify a German declaration of war. Several prisoners from Flossenbürg and other concentration camps were secretly transferred to a Gestapo prison in Breslau, poisoned, and dressed in Polish uniforms. On 31 August 1939, the bodies were dumped at a border post in Hochlinden where they were shot and hacked; photographs were taken as &quot;proof&quot; of a Polish attack on Germany.

==Expansion==
In September 1939, the SS transferred 1,000 political prisoners to Flossenbürg from Dachau in order to clear the latter camp to train the first regiment of the Waffen-SS. These prisoners, who were the first political prisoners at Flossenbürg, were moved back to Dachau in March 1940. The first foreign prisoners were transferred to the camp by the Gestapo in April, including Czech student protestors and Polish resistance members. The vast majority of the new foreign prisoners were incarcerated due to their opposition to the Nazi regime; a few of them were Jews. Most of the Jewish political prisoners were executed or died shortly after arriving from mistreatment. The last twelve surviving Jews were deported to Auschwitz on 19 October 1942, pursuant to Himmler&#x27;s order to make the Reich &quot;Judenrein&quot;.

The number of Polish prisoners increased sharply in 1941; on 23 January, 600 arrived from Auschwitz. In mid-October 1941, 1,700 to 2,000 Soviet prisoners of war arrived at Flossenbürg as part of a massive transfer of Soviet prisoners to the SS camp system. In poor condition due to their previous mistreatment, they spent several months recovering before they were deemed fit to work. They were accommodated in a special, cordoned-off area.

By February 1943, Flossenbürg had 4,004 prisoners, not including the Soviet prisoners of war. From April 1943, the commandant was Max Koegel, described by American historian Todd Huebner as &quot;a vicious martinet&quot; who lacked the ability to manage the camp during its rapid expansion. Continuing influxes of political prisoners from occupied countries caused Germans to become a minority that same year. During 1944, Flossenbürg&#x27;s population expanded almost eightfold, from 4,869 to 40,437, due to a high influx of mainly non-German prisoners. This was part of an expansion that applied over the entire Nazi concentration camp system.

By the end of 1943, the number of guards had increased to about 450, including 140 Ukrainian auxiliaries. As with other concentration camps, guards initially consisted of SS men from Germany and Austria, whose ranks were augmented with &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; recruits after 1942. The number of guards increased sixfold during 1944 and reached 4,500 by the time the camp was evacuated. Due to manpower shortages, fit young guards were called up for front-line service and many older men, members of the Wehrmacht and five hundred SS women were recruited into the guard force at Flossenbürg.

===Subcamps===

The expansion of the camp led to the establishment of subcamps, the first of which was established at Stulln in February 1942 to provide forced labor to a mining company. Many of them were located in the Sudetenland or across the border in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Initially, the subcamps were not involved in armaments production, which changed in the second half of 1944 due to a large influx of available prisoners and the activities of the &quot;Jägerstab&quot;, which sought to increase German aircraft production. The &quot;Jägerstab&quot;″s dispersal of aircraft production spurred the expansion of the subcamp system in 1944 and resulted in the establishment of the two largest of the subcamps, at Hersbruck and Leitmeritz. In the second half of 1944, 45 new camps were created, compared to three camps in the previous six months. The staffing of these new camps was increasingly filled by Luftwaffe soldiers, &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; SS men (ethnic Germans from outside the Reich), and SS women, for the subcamps containing female prisoners. By April 1945, 80% of the prisoners were at the subcamps.

==Forced labor==
===Quarries===
Three quarries were operational by the end of 1938, and a fourth opened in April 1941. All four quarries were located near the main camp, and the total planned output was annually. The stone was average quality blue-gray and yellow-gray granite, 90% of which was suitable for architectural purposes. Production gradually increased during 1940, but remained constant in 1941. Initially all work was done by manual labor; prisoners worked alongside civilian laborers and performed the most arduous and dangerous tasks. Accidents led to many deaths. Beginning in 1940 and 1941, machines were introduced to increase efficiency. In mid-1939, the quarries became the main use of labor in the camp and the following year they consumed half of the total labor, which was valued at 367,000 Reichsmarks.

From November 1940, some prisoners were trained as stonemasons in a specialized workshop; their numbers reached 1,200 by December 1942. The prisoners were instructed by civilian experts in a ten-week course covering both practical and theoretical topics but watched carefully by kapos. Those who failed to advance were sent to work in the quarries, while those whose productivity improved were given cigarettes and extra food. The stone that they cut was used for construction of the camp, the &quot;Autobahn&quot;, and various SS military projects, but later on it was destined for the monumental German Stadium project and the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg.

Of the five prewar concentration camps where economic industries were prominent, Flossenbürg was the one that was most significant and consistent in producing income for DEST. For example, it produced of stone in 1939, almost three-quarters of the total production that year. The largest buyer of Flossenbürg granite was Albert Speer&#x27;s office for the reconstruction of Berlin. Within this project the largest and most significant orders were for Wilhelm Kreis&#x27; Soldiers&#x27; Hall (&quot;Soldatenhalle&quot;) project, beginning in 1940. Increasing amounts of stone were used for road building; 15% in 1939 but 60% the next year.

The first quarry shut down in May 1943 and its workers were reassigned to arms production, but half of the prisoner labor was still going to the quarries. Although civilian production was being scaled back in order to reorient the economy to total war, DEST managed to secure permission to keep many of its quarries open into 1944. At Flossenbürg, the company maintained strong control over the economic enterprises of the camp, despite the fact that this aspect was supposed to be under the control of the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (SS-WHVA). In early 1944, 1,000 prisoners were still employed in the quarries.

===Aircraft and armaments===
During 1942, the focus of the SS shifted towards war production, leading to negotiations with arms manufacturers to license their products to DEST. Messerschmitt AG was one of the most important armaments companies that demonstrated interest in acquiring the slave labor of concentration camp prisoners, opening negotiations with DEST via Regensburg by the end of 1942 to produce parts for the Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft at Flossenbürg. Under the terms of the deal, Messerschmitt would provide skilled technicians, raw materials, and tools, paying DEST 3 Reichsmarks per day for a skilled laborer and 1.5 Reichsmarks per day for an unskilled prisoner. Thus, Messerschmitt could increase its profit margin by reducing labor costs, while DEST could reduce its administrative costs by acting as a manpower agency. In mid-January 1943, DEST accepted the offer; production started in early February.

According to Yad Vashem historian Daniel Uziel, the conversion of Flossenbürg to armaments production was especially significant because it had been the most profitable DEST enterprise. The number of prisoners working for Messerschmitt increased greatly after the bombing of Messerschmitt&#x27;s Regensburg plant on 17 August 1943. That month, 800 prisoners worked for Messerschmitt; a year later, 5,700 prisoners were employed in armaments production. , a subcontractor of Messerschmitt, established Flossenbürg subcamps to support its production: a subcamp at Johanngeorgenstadt, established in December 1943, to produce tailplanes for the Bf 109, and another subcamp at Mülsen-St. Micheln which produced aircraft wings, in January 1944. Despite strict regulations forbidding contact, the German civilian workers came into contact with prisoners and some helped by providing extra food or other assistance.

The Flossenbürg camp system had become a key supplier of Bf 109 parts by February 1944, when Messerschmitt&#x27;s Regensburg plant was bombed again during &quot;Big Week&quot;. Seven hundred Soviet prisoners who had been working at the Regensburg factory were transferred to Flossenbürg to continue working on Bf 109 production. Increased production at Flossenbürg was essential to restoring production in the aftermath of the attack. Aircraft manufacturer Arado eventually became one of the primary users of slave labor at the subcamps for the Arado Ar 234 jet bomber project, at Freiberg among other locations. Other prisoners in the subcamps were forced to work on synthetic oil production or repairing railways. Before the end of the war, about 18,000 prisoners at Flossenbürg and its subcamps were working on aviation-related projects.

==Conditions==

Ten percent of the deaths at Flossenbürg occurred before 1943. The quarries caused the death rate to be higher at Flossenbürg than at camps with less physically demanding industries, such as brickworks; the switch to armaments production in 1943 led to a decrease in the death rate. Prisoners also suffered from a shortage of fresh water, due to the elevation, and unusually cold and wet weather; their clothing was not adequate for these conditions. The main camp, situated in a narrow valley, had little room for expansion. Originally constructed for only 1,500 prisoners, the population of the main camp increased to between 10,000 and 11,000 before it was evacuated in April 1945. In order to increase productivity, the prisoners were forced to sleep and work in shifts. This also helped alleviate the chronic overcrowding in the barracks.

The prisoner functionaries at Flossenbürg were unusually brutal and corrupt because the positions had been taken by criminal prisoners even though overall only about 5% of prisoners had been classified as criminal. The final camp elder, Anton Uhl, was beaten to death by prisoners after liberation. Many of the criminal functionaries sexually abused young male prisoners, causing the commandant to isolate teenage boys in separate barracks. The SS hierarchy was also known for corruption and brutality. Prisoners were mistreated in various ways, from being beaten or doused with cold water to being shot by guards during alleged escape attempts.

The prisoners were chronically undernourished and disease was rampant. Conditions differed based on a prisoner&#x27;s status and race. Polish and Soviet prisoners occupied the lowest rungs on the prisoner hierarchy, being put on the most physically demanding work details and allocated less food than other prisoners. There was an epidemic of dysentery in January 1940 that shut down work at the camp, and typhus epidemics in September 1944 and January 1945 claimed many lives. The total number of prisoners who passed through Flossenbürg and its subcamps has been estimated at 89,964 or over 100,000. About 30,000 of the prisoners died at Flossenbürg or during its evacuation, the main causes of death were malnutrition and disease. Between 13,000 and 15,000 prisoners died at the main camp and more than 10,000 at the satellite camps. An estimated three-quarters of the deaths occurred in the nine months before liberation.

==Executions==

Due to increased mortality from the harsh conditions, the SS ordered the construction of an on-site crematorium, which was completed in May 1940. Executions by shooting began at Flossenbürg on 6 February 1941; the first victims were Polish political prisoners. Victims were separated after the evening roll call and read their sentences. After a night in the camp jail, they were shot at the firing range adjacent to the crematorium. After a mass execution of 80 Polish prisoners on 8 September, the execution method was changed to lethal injection due to complaints from local residents of blood and body parts washing up in nearby streams. The primary victims were Polish political prisoners and Soviet prisoners of war.

Doctors who had participated in the &quot;Aktion T4&quot; mass killings toured several concentration camps to select ill inmates to be transported to euthanasia centers; they visited Flossenbürg in March 1942. Thousands of prisoners who were worn out by forced labor were sent to death camps such as Majdanek and Auschwitz. One transport from Flossenbürg to Auschwitz arrived on 5 December 1943 with more than 250 of the 948 prisoners dead. By 18 February, only 393 survived. Women unable to work were often deported to Ravensbrück concentration camp.

The rate of executions increased during the final months of the camp. The SS liquidated prisoners who they suspected might try to escape or organize resistance; most of the victims were Russians. Some of them were high-profile prisoners who had been kept alive previously for interrogation. During the last days of the camp&#x27;s existence, the SS executed thirteen Allied secret agents and seven prominent German anti-Nazis, including former &quot;Abwehr&quot; head Wilhelm Canaris and the Confessing Church theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer. In all, the SS had executed at least 2,500 people at Flossenbürg.

==Final months==

A total of 12,000 prisoners in seventeen transports arrived at Flossenbürg in late 1944 and early 1945, causing the camp to fall into a state of disarray. The first of these prisoners had been evacuated from Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp in summer 1944. In early 1945, 2,000 prisoners were sent to Flossenbürg during the evacuation of Auschwitz concentration camp. 9,500 prisoners arrived after the evacuation of Gross-Rosen; of 3,000 on one transport, only 1,000 arrived alive. The influx of prisoners caused conditions to worsen and the death rate to increase dramatically: 3,370 prisoners died between mid-January and 13 April.

As there was not enough space in the infirmary for all of the sick prisoners, commandant Max Koegel ordered hundreds of sick prisoners sent to Bergen-Belsen in April. In order to cope with the disorder, he founded a camp police force composed of ethnic German prisoners, mostly criminals. These prisoners mistreated non-German prisoners. During the last months of the camp&#x27;s existence, many of the prisoners were idle because no raw materials for their work had arrived. Because of its location near the border of the Protectorate, Flossenbürg was the destination for evacuation transports from Buchenwald concentration camp when the Allies neared the camp in mid-April. At least 6,000 prisoners from Buchenwald arrived at Flossenbürg between 16 and 20 April; many of the Jews were sent on to the Theresienstadt Ghetto while non-Jewish prisoners remained at Flossenbürg. On 14 April, the population of Flossenbürg and its subcamps was 45,800, including 16,000 women. The main camp&#x27;s population peaked at between 10,000 and 11,000.

==Death marches==

On 14 April 1945, SS leader Heinrich Himmler ordered all of the camps to be evacuated: &quot;Not a single prisoner must fall alive into enemy hands&quot;. As soon as he received the order, Koegel sent some families of SS men away and prepared to evacuate the camp. At 5 am on 16 April, the 1,700 Jewish prisoners at Flossenbürg main camp were separated from the rest and ordered to assemble. Eight SS men guarded each column of 100 prisoners. When they reached the railway station, distant, they were loaded into closed and open freight cars, 60 to 75 each. The train was strafed by United States aircraft soon after setting out, causing the guards to flee temporarily. Many prisoners were injured or killed; others rummaged for food that the SS guards had left behind. After the raid, the guards returned and shot injured prisoners. The total number of deaths was several dozen, increasing in the next two days as the prisoners were not provided with food or water.

The route proceeded by rail through Neunburg vorm Wald, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Pfreimd, Nabburg, and Schwarzenfeld, where, on 19 or 20 April, about 750 of the Jewish prisoners were stranded after another aerial attack disabled the locomotive. The SS murdered any prisoners who were unable to continue the march on foot. After the liberation, 140 corpses were found in a nearby field; some of the victims had been killed in the air raid, while others had been murdered. One prisoner testified that &quot;The SS men joked and laughed during the shooting ... the prisoners were led in groups of 15–20, they had to lie on the ground and were shot in the nape&quot;. The survivors were divided into columns 100-strong and marched through heavy rain and mud. Many were ill with fever, but anyone unable to keep up was shot on the spot. At Neukirchen-Balbini, the death march joined up with the larger one of non-Jewish prisoners. Another group of Jewish evacuees continued towards Theresienstadt, arriving in early May.

Evacuation of non-Jewish prisoners began on 17 April, when 2,000 prisoners left on foot, arriving at Dachau on 23 April. This group consisted of longtime Flossenbürg prisoners, a group from Ohrdruf concentration camp, and the survivors of the death march from Buchenwald. SS official Kurt Becher, who was involved in negotiations between Himmler and the Allies, visited Flossenbürg on 17 April and attempted to persuade Koegel not to evacuate the camp. A telegram from Himmler the next day repeated the order not to let any prisoner fall into enemy hands. On 19 April, some 25,000 to 30,000 remaining prisoners in Flossenbürg and its subcamps were ordered to evacuate to Dachau. About 16,000 prisoners actually set out, and only a few thousand reached their destination. The prisoners were transported by rail to Oberviechtach, where they split into two groups. One of these traveled by foot and in trucks via Külz, Dieterskirchen, and Schwarzhofen, joining the earlier march of Jewish prisoners in Neunburg. Many prisoners remained in the town from 20–22 April, when the SS guards deserted. The United States Army arrived in the area on 23 April and found 2,500 surviving prisoners. Many others were liberated on the road to Cham, to the southeast.

At many of Flossenbürg&#x27;s subcamps, the SS massacred sick Jewish prisoners before evacuating. Including these massacres, the death marches cost the lives of about 7,000 prisoners from Flossenbürg and its subcamps. The 90th Infantry Division of the United States Army liberated the main camp on 23 April and found 1,527 ill and weak prisoners in the camp hospital; more than 100 prisoners had died in the preceding three days. Despite the efforts of American medics, only 1,208 prisoners survived the immediate aftermath of liberation. Initially, the American authorities ordered the bodies to be burned in the camp crematorium, but after protests from the survivors, held a funeral for 21 former prisoners on 3 May. Some of Flossenbürg&#x27;s eastern subcamps, located east of the demarcation line, were liberated by the Red Army.

==Flossenbürg Trial==


Investigation of Nazi war criminals at Flossenbürg began on 6 May 1945, when the United States Army appointed eleven investigators. &quot;SS- Hauptsturmführer&quot; Friedrich Becker, the head of the labor department at Flossenbürg, had signed most of the transport lists and was considered the most important perpetrator by the American prosecutors; Koegel had committed suicide by hanging shortly after being captured by the Americans in 1946. After a year of pretrial investigation, the United States charged Becker and fifty other defendants on 14 May 1946. The defendants, who were tried before a United States military court at Dachau between 12 June 1946 and 22 January 1947, all pleaded not guilty. Thirty-three of the defendants were low-ranking SS members, sixteen were former prisoner functionaries, and two were civilians. Charges against seven were dropped and five were found not guilty. Of the remainder of the defendants, fifteen received death sentences, eleven life sentences, and the remainder jail terms of varying length.

After the trial, two of the prosecution witnesses were tried for perjury following a petition by the nephew of a defendant. One was convicted and the other acquitted, leading to judicial review of the charges against the defendants, but a War Crimes Board of Review found that the perjury had not affected the outcome of the trial. Two of the defendants who had received death sentences had their sentences reduced on appeal. The remaining death sentences were carried out on 3 and 15 October 1947 or 1948. Between December 1950 and December 1951, the remaining twenty-six prisoners had their sentences reviewed. Most were commuted to time served or a shorter term. The last prisoner was paroled in 1957 and had his sentence remitted on 11 June 1958.

==Commemoration==
After liberation, Flossenbürg was used to hold Axis Disarmed Enemy Forces and later as a displaced persons camp. During the following decades, much of the camp was built over or repurposed. For example, the former prisoner laundry and kitchen were used commercially until the 1990s.

The first memorial on the site was set up in 1946, and the cemetery was added during the 1950s. A small exhibition was opened in 1985, and a permanent museum opened in what had been the laundry room in 2007. A second exhibition has existed since 2010 in the prisoner kitchen. A list of the names of more than 21,000 prisoners who died at the camp is available on the museum&#x27;s website.

The Flossenbürg camp quarry is on land owned by Bavarian state government, and was leased to the private mining company Granitwerke Baumann in 2004, who continued to operate the quarry for granite extraction. The lease was set to expire in March of 2024, and Granitwerke Baumann expressed interest in extending the lease for a further 10 years. However, due to efforts by the Green Party, Flossenbürg Concentration Camp Memorial head Jörg Skriebeleit, and local activist Stefan Krapf, the lease was not renewed, and the government mandated the site to be incorporated into the memorial. Cleanup of the quarry and discussions regarding memorial design are still underway as of January, 2025.

<text>Quiche Lorraine is a savoury French tart with a filling of cream, eggs, and bacon or ham, in an open pastry case. It was little known outside the French region of Lorraine until the mid-20th century. As its popularity spread, nationally and internationally, the addition of cheese became commonplace, although it has been criticised as inauthentic. It may be served hot, warm or cold.

==History==

According to &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot;, quiches (sometimes spelled kiches) originated in the eastern French region Lorraine. The name may derive from the German &quot;Kuchen&quot;, a term used for similar dishes. There are many varieties of quiche, and Larousse comments that every region of Alsace and Lorraine has its own and maintains it is the only authentic version of the dish. Originally a quiche Lorraine was baked with a bread-dough case similar to that now used for pissaladières and pizzas, but in modern versions, shortcrust or puff pastry is generally used. The dish dates to the 16th century, but until well into the 20th century it was little known outside its region of origin, and was as seldom seen in Paris as in foreign countries.

==Ingredients==

The classic ingredients for the filling are eggs, thick cream, and ham or bacon (in strips or lardons), made into a savoury custard. Elizabeth David in her &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot; (1960) and Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child in their &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot; (1961) excluded cheese from their recipes for quiche Lorraine, and David in particular was scornful of cooks and manufacturers who added it. She considered they did so for reasons of cost and convenience rather than taste: a classic quiche Lorraine, with only a cream, egg and bacon filling, is &quot;quite tricky to get right&quot;.
David placed the responsibility for the inauthentic addition of cheese with Parisian chefs. In 1870 Jules Gouffé introduced a version to which he added Parmesan, and in 1903 Auguste Escoffier recommended lining the pastry case with bacon and strips of Gruyère before adding the cream and egg mixture. Attempts were made to restore the simplicity of the original dish: in 1901 &quot;Le Figaro&quot; printed a recipe that excluded not only cheese but also bacon, and in 1904 André Theuriet and a fellow native of Lorraine, Edmond Richardin, published another recipe that included neither bacon nor cheese, but in 1932 Marcel Boulestin, a highly influential restaurateur and writer, specified the addition of grated Gruyère, and by the 1950s the use of cheese had become commonplace as the popularity of quiche Lorraine grew. David cited a London cookery school where the students were taught to use evaporated milk and processed Cheddar for their fillings. La Mère Brazier&#x27;s standard recipe for the dish excluded cheese, but she thought variations permissible, &quot;replac[ing] the lardons and the ham with a layer of sliced Roquefort ... or with thin slices of goose or duck liver and fresh truffle&quot;.

Among some recent versions of the dish, Anne-Sophie Pic&#x27;s adds Comté, and Delia Smith&#x27;s adds both Cheddar and Parmesan. No cheese is used in the versions by Lindsey Bareham, Felicity Cloake, Alain Ducasse, Simon Hopkinson, Thomas Keller and Dan Lepard. Ready-made quiches Lorraines sold in supermarkets in France, Britain and the US typically contain cheese – usually Emmental or similar, although British versions often contain Cheddar.

The dish may be served hot, warm or cold.

<text>Lucius Benjamin Appling (April 2, 1907 – January 3, 1991), nicknamed &quot;Old Aches and Pains&quot;, was an American professional baseball shortstop who played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Sox (1930–1950). He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964.

Born in North Carolina, Appling briefly attended Oglethorpe College. He was signed by the minor league Atlanta Crackers in 1930 and debuted with the Chicago White Sox later that year. He interrupted his career to serve in World War II in 1944 and 1945. He played for Chicago until 1950, then was a minor league manager and major league coach for many years. He served one stint as an interim major league manager in 1967. He died in Georgia in 1991.

==Early life and career==
Appling was born in High Point, North Carolina. He attended Fulton High School in Atlanta, Georgia. He later said that he had been lefthanded, a trait that he shared with his father, until he was in high school. At that point, he said that he became righthanded because he wanted to play shortstop.

Appling attended Oglethorpe College in Atlanta for two years. In 1930, the Oglethorpe baseball team was undefeated in a 15-game season; in his last game at Oglethorpe, Appling hit three home runs against Mercer University.
Appling signed with the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern League that year. He was a good hitter in his first year, but committed 42 errors in 104 games. The Chicago Cubs showed some interest at first, but decided not to sign him, and the White Sox ended up purchasing him from the Crackers for $20,000.

==MLB playing career==

===Early career===
Appling appeared in only six games for the White Sox in 1930. He hit for a .232 batting average in 96 games in 1931. In 1933 his average increased from .274 to .322 in his first of nine straight .300 seasons. The White Sox lost more than 90 games in four of Appling&#x27;s first five seasons with the team.

In 1936, Appling batted .388, with 124 runs batted in, scored 111 times, recorded 204 hits, and had a team-record 27-game hitting streak. His batting average was good for the first AL batting title won by a shortstop. It was the highest batting average recorded by a shortstop in the 20th century. He finished second in the AL Most Valuable Player voting and earned his first All-Star Game selection. He also turned a league-leading 119 double plays.

===Later career===
Appling hit .317 in 1937 as the White Sox finished in third place in the AL. He played in 81 games in 1938, missing much of the season with a broken leg.

In 1940, Appling hit .348 with a career-high 13 triples. Although the team finished fourth, they came closer to a league championship than at any point in his career, eight games behind the league champion Detroit Tigers. Appling won another batting title in 1943 with a .328 average and also led the league in OBP that year (.419).

Appling missed the entire 1944 season due to military service in the United States Army, then returned in time to appear in only 18 games the next year.

He hit .309 in 149 games in 1946. Though his seventh and final All-Star Game selection came in 1947 when he hit .306, Appling hit .314 and .301 in 1948 and 1949, respectively. Appling had remained a solid contributor into his forties, but White Sox ownership was dedicated to a youth movement and he retired after the 1950 season.

===Career statistics===
In 2,422 games over 20 seasons, Appling posted a .310 batting average (2,749-for-8,856) with 1,319 runs, 440 doubles, 102 triples, 45 home runs, 1,116 RBI, 179 stolen bases, 1,302 bases on balls, .399 on-base percentage and .398 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .948 fielding percentage playing primarily at shortstop, but also played at third, second and first base.

===Legacy===
Upon his retirement, Appling was the all-time leader for most games played and for double plays by a major league shortstop, and the all-time leader for putouts and assists by an American League shortstop. These records were later broken by Luis Aparicio, who also spent the majority of his career with the White Sox. He made 643 errors and has the worst fielding percentage since 1910 of players with at least 1,900 games, but his speed and range made his defensive ability excellent nonetheless throughout his career.

Appling was a good lead-off hitter who topped the .400 mark in OBP eight times (1935–1937, 1939–40, 1943, 1948–49) and drew over 100 walks three times (1935, 1939, 1949), although he often batted third due to otherwise poor team hitting on the White Sox.

He was well known for his ability to foul off pitches. Charlie Metro testified to this reputation: &quot;The old White Sox shortstop Luke Appling was a delight. I&#x27;ve heard quite a few stories about Luke, but the one that always pleases me the most is about watching Luke take batting practice. As extra guys with the Tigers, we wouldn&#x27;t get too many swings in batting practice, if any, but we liked to go out to the ballpark early and watch them taking batting practice. Luke was a star for the ball club, a good hitter, a good fielder, good at driving in runs, good everything, just a good, good ballplayer. The White Sox then were noted for their stinginess. You couldn&#x27;t get a baseball out of them. Luke was popular, and everybody wanted an autographed baseball from a big league club, and especially from a guy like Luke. So he&#x27;d ask for the baseballs, and the White Sox management would send a message down, &#x27;No!&#x27; He couldn&#x27;t get any baseballs for autographs. So Luke would take batting practice early. I don&#x27;t know whether he hit third, fourth, or fifth, I forget, but he&#x27;d lead off the batting practice. He could foul off every pitch. He was noted for fouling off pitches. He&#x27;d foul the balls into the grandstand, and the kids would grab the balls. Luke would flip the bat and look up at the press box as if to say, &#x27;Take that!&#x27; I saw him do it once, and they talked about him doing that all the time. I understand he got baseballs pretty much whenever he wanted. It was either that, or he&#x27;d lose them all in batting practice.&quot;

Appling was famous among his teammates for complaining about minor ailments such as a sore back, a weak shoulder, shin splints, or a sprained finger. While much of this complaining was probably for show it earned him the nicknames &quot;Old Aches and Pains&quot; and &quot;Libby&quot;, the latter after blues singer Libby Holman. &quot;His constant stream of complaints might have become intolerable to his teammates if Appling had not developed a novel remedy,&quot; wrote Robert McG. Thomas Jr. of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;He simply took his misery out on opposing pitchers, rapping out 2,749 hits, all but 587 of them singles.&quot;

==Later life==

Appling was a successful minor league manager after his playing days were over, winning pennants with Memphis in the Southern Association and Indianapolis of the American Association and being named minor league manager of the year in 1952.

Beginning in 1954, he managed the unaffiliated Richmond Virginians, a Class AAA team in the International League which affiliated with the New York Yankees in 1958 but after 1964 moved and became the Toledo Mud Hens.

Appling&#x27;s only chance to manage at the major league level was as a late-season replacement for Alvin Dark as manager of the Kansas City Athletics in 1967, which resulted in his major league managerial record of just 10-30.

Appling was a major league coach for the Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Baltimore Orioles, Athletics and White Sox during the 1960s and early 1970s.

Though Appling received only two Baseball Hall of Fame votes when he appeared on the ballot in 1953, he was eventually elected in 1964. No candidate had received enough votes for induction based on the initial 1964 election; however, Appling was named on the most ballots and he defeated Red Ruffing in a subsequent runoff vote.

In 1970, the Chicago chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America named Appling the greatest player in the history of the White Sox. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;.

On July 19, 1982, Appling played in the initial 1982 Cracker Jack Old Timers game (1982-1990) at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., where the then 75-year-old Hall of Fame shortstop hit a home run off Warren Spahn in the first inning into the left field bleachers, the ball having traveled 265 feet. RFK Stadium was in football configuration at the time, resulting in a short left-field fence.

In 1989, &quot;The New York Times&quot; profiled the then 82-year-old Appling, who had been an annual Spring Training coach with the Atlanta Braves for 14 years and was also serving as a minor league coach during the season.

On January 3, 1991, two days after retiring from the Atlanta coaching staff, Appling was in a hospital in Cumming, Georgia, suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He died during emergency surgery.

&quot;Old Aches and Pains&quot; was interred in Sawnee View Memorial Gardens, Mausoleum Chapel West in Cumming, Georgia.

Pitcher Eddie Lopat remembered Appling, saying, &quot;I played with him and against him, and he was the finest shortstop I ever saw. In the field, he covered more ground than anyone in the league. As a hitting shortstop, there was no one in his class.&quot;

In 1999, he was named as a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Appling as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army during World War II.

<doc id="355188" wikidata="Q4671194" url="?curid=355188" title="Academic dress of the University of Wales">
<text>The academic dress of the former University of Wales was designed for the first graduations in 1893, and has as its main identifying feature a faculty colour scheme involving &#x27;shot silks&#x27;.

Although the University of Wales no longer exists in its former guise, the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David nonetheless uses its academic dress scheme.

== Gowns ==

Undergraduates wear a gown of black stuff, in the Oxford scholar&#x27;s shape.

Bachelors, holders of advanced first degrees (such as the MChem, MMath, etc.) and holders of foundation degrees or undergraduate diplomas wear a black stuff or silk gown of the Oxford BA shape, but with the forearm seam divided for 4&quot; and the two flaps turned back and held in place with two buttons; between the flaps is a short length of black ribbon, held by a third button. This is said to represent the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers.

Masters (except holders of advanced first degrees) wear a black stuff or silk gown of the Oxford MA shape with inverted-T armholes and the lower point of the sleeve boot replaced by a right angle. For more information on the classification of academic dress, see the Groves classification system.

Doctors in undress wear the masters&#x27; gown.

In full dress, Doctors of Philosophy (PhD), Engineering (EngD), Nursing Science (DNursSc), Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy), Educational Psychology (DEdPsy) and Ministry (DMin) wear a crimson cloth gown of the Cambridge doctors&#x27; shape, with facings and sleeve linings of the appropriate faculty silk.

In full dress, higher doctors (DD, LLD, MD, DMus, DLitt, DSc, DScEcon and DChD) wear a scarlet cloth gown of the Cambridge doctors&#x27; shape, with facings and sleeve linings of the relevant faculty silk.

== Hoods ==

Holders of foundation degrees and certain diplomas wear a black hood bound with a twisted cord of blue, crimson and gold

Bachelors wear a hood of black stuff or silk in a modified Oxford simple shape, partly lined with 3&quot; of silk in the relevant faculty colour (see below). The exceptions to this rule are the MB BCh and BDS (which are fully lined) and the BMus (which is made of dark blue stuff or silk).

Masters (including holders of advanced first degrees) wear a hood of black corded silk in the Cambridge full shape, fully lined with silk in the appropriate faculty colour (see below). The exceptions are the MMus (whose hood is made of dark blue corded silk) and the MRes and MPhil (who wear the same hood as prescribed for the corresponding taught master&#x27;s degree, with an additional crimson binding in the case of the MPhil).

Doctors wear a hood of crimson (in the case of the PhD, EngD, DNursSc, DClinPsy, DEdPsy and DMin) or scarlet (in the case of the higher doctorates DD, LLD, MD, DMus, DLitt, DSc, DScEcon and DChD) cloth, lined and bound in the relevant faculty colour silk.

== Hats ==

Undergraduates, holders of diplomas or foundation degrees, bachelors and masters, as well as doctors in undress, wear a black cloth mortar board.

Doctors in full dress wear a black velvet mortar board.

== Faculty silks ==

The University of Wales has adopted a faculty colour scheme making wide use of shot silks, first proposed by Lady Verney. The faculty colours are as follows.

<doc id="355191" wikidata="Q623941" url="?curid=355191" title="Spinet">
<text>A spinet is a smaller type of harpsichord or other keyboard instrument, such as a piano or organ.

==Harpsichords==
When the term &quot;spinet&quot; is used to designate a harpsichord, typically what is meant is the &quot;bentside spinet&quot;, described in this section. For other uses, see below.

The bentside spinet shares most of its characteristics with the full-size instrument, including action, soundboard, and case construction. What primarily distinguishes the spinet is the angle of its strings: whereas in a full-size harpsichord, the strings are at a 90-degree angle to the keyboard (that is, they are parallel to the player&#x27;s gaze); and in virginals they are parallel to the keyboard, in a spinet the strings are at an angle of about 30 degrees to the keyboard, going toward the right. 

The case of a bentside spinet is approximately triangular. The side on the right is usually bent concavely (hence the name of the instrument), curving away from the player toward the right rear corner. The longest side is adjacent to and parallel with the bass strings, going from the right rear corner to a location on the player&#x27;s left. The front side of the spinet contains the keyboard. Typically, there are very short sides at the right rear and on the left, connecting the bentside to the long side and the long side to the front.

The other major aspect of spinet design is that the strings are arranged in pairs. The gap between the two strings of a pair is about four millimetres, and the wider gap between pairs is about ten. The jacks (which pluck the strings) are arranged in pairs as well, placed in the wider gap. They face in opposite directions, plucking the adjacent string on either side of the wider gap. The fact that half of the gaps are four millimetres instead of ten makes it possible to crowd more strings together into a smaller case.
The disadvantage of the paired design is that it generally limits the spinet to a single choir of strings, at eight-foot pitch, although a double-strung spinet by John Player is known. In a full-size harpsichord, the registers that guide the jacks can be shifted slightly to one side, permitting the player to control whether or not that particular set of strings is sounded. This is impossible in a spinet, due to the alternating orientation of the jacks. For an exception to this point, see &quot;spinettone&quot;, below.
The angling of the strings also had consequences for tone quality: generally, it was not possible to make the plucking points as close to the nut as in a regular harpsichord. Thus spinets normally had a slightly different tone quality, with fewer higher harmonics. Spinets also had smaller soundboards than regular harpsichords, and normally had a weaker sound. For these reasons, the spinet was normally only a domestic instrument, purchased to save money and conserve domestic space.

===History===
Harpsichord historian Frank Hubbard wrote in 1967, &quot;the earliest [bentside] spinet known to me was made by Hieronymus de Zentis in 1631. It is quite possible that Zentis was the inventor of the type so widely copied in other countries.&quot; He further notes that the spinet in France was sometimes called the &quot;épinette à l&#x27;italienne&quot;, supporting an Italian origin.

In England, builders included John Player, Thomas Barton, Charles Haward, Stephen Keene, Cawton Aston, and Thomas Hitchcock.

The spinet was later developed into the &quot;spinettone&quot; (&quot;big spinet&quot;) by Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731), the inventor of the piano. The spinettone incorporated multiple choirs of strings, with a disposition of 1 × 8 ft, 1 × 4 ft, and used the same ingenious mechanism for changing stops that Cristofori had earlier used for his oval spinet. The spinettone was a local success among the musicians of the Medici court, and Cristofori eventually built a total of four of them.

Spinets are occasionally made today, sometimes from kits, and serve the same purpose they always have, of saving money and space.

===Other uses of &quot;spinet&quot; for harpsichords===

The pentagonal spinet was not a spinet in the sense given above, but rather a virginal; its strings were parallel to the keyboard. Typically, the pentagonal spinet was more compact than other types of virginals, as the pentagon shape arose from lopping off the corners of the original rectangular virginal design.

More generally, the word &quot;spinet&quot; was not always very sharply defined in former times, particularly in its French and Italian cognate forms &quot;épinette&quot; and &quot;spinetta&quot;. Thus, for example, when Bartolomeo Cristofori invented a new kind of virginals in 1688, he called it the &quot;spinetta ovale&quot;, &quot;oval spinet&quot;.

===Nomenclature===
In earlier times when English spelling was less standardized, &quot;spinet&quot; was sometimes spelled &quot;spinnet&quot; or &quot;spinnit&quot;. &quot;Spinet&quot; is standard today.

&quot;Spinet&quot; derives from the Italian &quot;spinetta&quot;, which in 17th-century Italian was a word used generally for all quilled instruments, especially what in Elizabethan/Jacobean English were called virginals. The specific Italian word for a virginals is &quot;spinetta a tabola&quot;. Likewise, the French derivation from &quot;spinetta&quot;, &quot;épinette&quot;, is specifically what the virginals is called in French, although the word is also used for any other small quilled instrument, whether a small harpsichord or a clavichord. In German, &quot;Spinett&quot; and &quot;Querflügel&quot; are used.

A &quot;dumb spinet&quot; is a manichord or &quot;clavichord or clarichord&quot;, according to the 1913 edition of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;.

==Pianos==
The spinet piano, manufactured from the 1930s until recent times, was the culmination of a trend among manufacturers to make pianos smaller and cheaper. It served the purpose of making pianos available for a low price, for owners who had little space for a piano. Many spinet pianos still exist today, left over from their period of manufacture.

The defining characteristic of the spinet was its &quot;drop action&quot; (sometimes called &quot;indirect blow action&quot;). In this device, the keys did not engage the action directly; rather they pulled upward on rods called &quot;stickers&quot;, which in turn pulled upward on levers located below the level of the keyboard, which in turn engaged the action. The stickers were sufficiently long that the hammer heads (the highest part of the action) ended up at roughly the same vertical level as the keyboard.

Thanks to the drop action, spinet pianos could be made very small; the top of a spinet rose only a few inches above the level of the keyboard itself. However, according to piano author Larry Fine, the cost in quality was considerable. The stickers were &quot;often noisy and troublesome&quot;. Moreover, to make room for them, the keys had to be made shorter, resulting in &quot;very poor leverage&quot; and thus a poor sense of touch and control for the player. Lastly, the very short strings of the spinet resulted in a narrow range of harmonics and thus in poor tone quality.

The spinet was also the bane of piano technicians. Concerning the difficulty of servicing them, Fine writes

Spinets ... are very difficult to service because even the smallest repair requiring removal of the action becomes a major ordeal. Each of the connecting stickers has to be disconnected and tied up to the action and all the keys have to be removed from the piano before the action can be lifted out.

===History===
According to piano historian Arthur Loesser (1954), the first spinet piano was offered to the public in May 1935, by an American manufacturer Loesser does not identify. However, according to the Blue Book of Pianos, this manufacturer was Winter and Company (which eventually became part of the Aeolian-American Corporation) who sold this piano as the Winter &quot;Musette&quot;. The Musette, along with its spinet cousins, were initially a success, being the only kind of piano that many people could afford in the depths of the Great Depression. (According to Loesser, the price could be less than $300, &quot;about twenty-five percent lower than ... a small upright of 1924.&quot;) Loesser notes that the spinet was not entirely new, as very small pianos had been manufactured at various times in the 19th century.

After the 1930s, many people still continued to purchase spinets; a 1947 study showed that about 50 percent of all pianos sold during that production year were pianos strung vertically of in height or less. The spinet enjoyed decades of popularity after the 1930s, but production was halted in the early 1990s.

==Organs==
The spinet organ, a product of the mid-20th century, served the same function (domestic context, low cost) that was served by spinet harpsichords and spinet pianos. The spinet organ physically resembled a small upright piano, and presented simplified controls and functions that were both less expensive to produce and less intimidating to learn than other organs.

<text>The Dream of Scipio (Latin: Somnium Scipionis), written by Cicero, is the sixth book of &quot;De re publica&quot;, and describes a (postulated fictional or real) dream vision of the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus, set two years before he oversaw the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC.

== Textual history ==

The &quot;Somnium Scipionis&quot; is a portion of the sixth and final book from Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De re publica&quot;, but because parts of Cicero&#x27;s whole work are missing, &quot;Somnium Scipionis&quot; represents nearly all that remains of the sixth book. The main reason that the &quot;Somnium Scipionis&quot; survived was because in the fifth-century, the Latin writer Macrobius wrote a Neoplatonic commentary on the work, in which he excerpted large portions from Cicero. Additionally, many copies of Macrobius&#x27;s work were amended with a copy of the &quot;Somnium Scipionis&quot; at their end. However, during the Middle Ages, the &quot;Somnium Scipionis&quot; became so popular that its transmission was polluted by multiple copies, and today it has been impossible to establish a stemma for it.

== Contents ==

Upon his arrival in Africa, a guest at the court of Massinissa, Scipio Aemilianus is visited by his dead grandfather-by-adoption, Scipio Africanus, hero of the Second Punic War. He finds himself looking down upon Carthage &quot;from a high place full of stars, shining and splendid&quot;. His future is foretold by his grandfather, and great stress is placed upon the loyal duty of the Roman soldier, who will as a reward after death &quot;inhabit... that circle that shines forth among the stars which you have learned from the Greeks to call the Milky Way&quot;. Nevertheless, Scipio Aemilianus sees that Rome is an insignificant part of the earth, which is itself dwarfed by the stars.

Then, Scipio Aemilianus sees that the universe is made up of nine celestial spheres. The earth is the innermost, whereas the highest is heaven, which &quot;contains all the rest, and is itself the supreme God&quot; (&quot;unus est caelestis&quot; [...] &quot;qui reliquos omnes complectitur, summus ipse deus&quot;). In between these two extremes lie the seven spheres of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn (which proceed from lowest to highest). As he stares in wonder at the universe, Scipio Aemilianus begins to hear a &quot;so great and so sweet&quot; (&quot;tantus et tam dulcis&quot;) sound, which Scipio Africanus identifies as the &quot;musica universalis&quot;: the &quot;music of the spheres&quot;. He explains to his grandson that because the planets are set apart at fixed intervals, a sound is produced as they move. The moon, being the lowest sphere and the one closest to Earth, emits the lowest sound of all, whereas the heaven emits the highest. The Earth, on the other hand, does not move, remaining motionless at the center of the universe.

Then the climatic belts of the earth are observed, from the snow fields to the deserts, and there is discussion of the nature of the Divine, the soul and virtue, from the Stoic point of view.

== Relation to other works ==

The tale is modelled on the &quot;Myth of Er&quot; in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. Although the story of Er records a near-death experience, while the journey of Scipio&#x27;s &quot;disembodied soul&quot; takes place in a dream, both give examples of belief in astral projection.

== Reception and influence ==

The literary and philosophical influence of the &quot;Somnium&quot; was great. Macrobius&#x27; &quot;Commentary upon Scipio&#x27;s Dream&quot; was known to the sixth-century philosopher Boethius, and was later valued throughout the Middle Ages as a primer of cosmology. The work assumed the astrological cosmos formulated by Claudius Ptolemy. Chretien de Troyes referred to Macrobius&#x27; work in his first Arthurian romance, &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;, and it was a model for Dante&#x27;s account of heaven and hell. Chaucer referred to the work in &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot; and especially in the &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot;.

Some critics consider Raphael&#x27;s painting &quot;Vision of a Knight&quot; to be a depiction of Scipio&#x27;s Dream.

The composer Mozart, at the age of fifteen, wrote a short opera entitled &quot;Il sogno di Scipione&quot; (K. 126), with a libretto by Metastasio, based upon Scipio Aemilianus&#x27;s &#x27;soul-journey&#x27; through the cosmos.

Iain Pears wrote a historical novel called &quot;The Dream of Scipio&quot; which, though attributed to fictional classical writer Manlius, refers to Cicero&#x27;s work in various direct and indirect ways.

Bernard Field, in the preface to his &quot;History of Science Fiction&quot;, cited Scipio&#x27;s vision of the Earth as seen from a great height as a forerunner of modern science fiction writers describing the experience of flying in orbit — particularly noting the similarity between Scipio&#x27;s realization that Rome is but a small part of the Earth with similar feeling by characters in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s works.

This story is the basis for Chris McCully&#x27;s poem &quot;Scipio&#x27;s Dream&quot; from his collection &quot;Not Only I&quot;, published in 1996.

<text>La damnation de Faust (English: &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot;), Op. 24 is a French musical composition for four solo voices, full seven-part chorus, large children&#x27;s chorus and orchestra by the French composer Hector Berlioz. He called it a &quot;légende dramatique&quot; (dramatic legend). It was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 6 December 1846.

==Background and composition history==
Berlioz read Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust, Part One&quot; in 1828, in Gérard de Nerval&#x27;s translation. he recalled in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;.

: &quot;...this marvellous book fascinated me from the first...I could not put it down. I read it incessantly, at meals, in the theatre, in the street.&quot; 

The work so impressed Berlioz that he composed a suite entitled &quot;Eight Scenes from Faust&quot;, which became his Opus 1 (1829), though he later recalled all the copies of it he could find. He returned to the material in 1845, to make a larger work, with some additional text by Almire Gandonnière to Berlioz&#x27;s specifications, that he first called a &quot;concert opera&quot;, and as it expanded, finally a &quot;légende dramatique&quot; (&quot;dramatic legend&quot;).

Berlioz worked on the score during his concert tour of 1845, adding his own text for &quot;Nature immense, impénétrable et fière&quot;—Faust&#x27;s climactic invocation of all nature—and incorporating the Rákóczi March, which had been a thunderous success at a concert in Pest, Hungary, on 15 February 1846.

==Performance history==
Its first performance at the Opéra-Comique, Paris, 6 December 1846, did not meet with critical acclaim, perhaps due to its halfway status between opera and cantata. The public was apathetic, and two performances (and a cancelled third) rendered a financial setback for Berlioz:

: &quot;Nothing in my career as an artist wounded me more deeply than this unexpected indifference&quot;, he remembered.

&quot;La damnation de Faust&quot; is performed regularly in concert halls, since its first successful complete performance in concert in Paris, in 1877. Sir Charles Hallé gave the first complete performance in England on 5 February 1880. It is occasionally staged as an opera, for the first time in Opéra de Monte-Carlo on 18 February 1893, where it was produced by its director Raoul Gunsbourg with Jean de Reszke singing the role of Faust and Rose Caron, Marguerite. The Metropolitan Opera premiered it first in concert (2 February 1896) and then on stage (the United States stage premiere on 7 December 1906) and revived it in concert at Carnegie Hall on 10 November 1996 (repeated on tour in Tokyo the next year). The company presented a staged production on 7 November 2008, produced and directed by Robert Lepage, with techniques of computer-generated stage imagery that responded to the performers&#x27; voices. Filmmaker Terry Gilliam made his opera debut at London&#x27;s English National Opera in May 2011, directing &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot;. In 2015, the Opéra National de Paris reimagined the role of Faust by assuming the persona of English scientist Stephen Hawking for that role. This version of the work also reinterpreted the metaphysical journey Faust is sent on by Méphistophélès in relation to the Mars One project; portraying the dilemma of man leaving earth to populate Mars. The Paris Opera cooperated with NASA, ESA, CNES. and film companies which produce environmental films for the production of Berlioz&#x27;s work.

Three instrumental passages, the &quot;Marche Hongroise&quot; (Hungarian March), &quot;Ballet des sylphes&quot;, and &quot;Menuet des follets&quot; are sometimes extracted and performed as &quot;Three Orchestral Pieces from &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;.&quot;

==Analysis==
Julian Rushton has examined the general chronology of Berlioz&#x27;s composition of the work. Kent Werth has written about Berlioz&#x27;s sketches for the passage &#x27;Invocation a la nature&#x27; and what their indications about Berlioz&#x27;s working methods.

Eric Stark has commented on Berlioz&#x27;s use of the chorus to convey specific information about time, place, and visual imagery in the work. Inge van Rij has discussed various &#x27;technological tropes&#x27; implicit in the work. 

==Roles==
==Instrumentation==
The orchestral score requires:
*3 flutes (all doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (second doubling English horn), 2 clarinets (in C/A/B), bass clarinet in B, 4 bassoons
*4 horns (in all keys), 2 trumpets in C/D/F, 2 cornets in A/B, 3 trombones, 2 tubas (originally scored for one ophicleide and one tuba)
*timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, suspended cymbal, triangle, tamtam, bell (sounding D, F, A, or C)
*2 harps
*strings: 15 violins I, 15 violins II, 10 violas, 10 violoncellos, 9 double basses

==Synopsis==
===Part I===

The aging scholar Faust contemplates the renewal of nature. Hearing peasants sing and dance, he realizes that their simple happiness is something he will never experience. An army marches past in the distance (Hungarian March). Faust doesn&#x27;t understand why the soldiers are so enthusiastic about glory and fame.

===Part II===
Depressed, Faust has returned to his study. Even the search for wisdom can no longer inspire him. Tired of life, he is about to commit suicide when the sound of church bells and an Easter hymn remind him of his youth, when he still had faith in religion. Suddenly Méphistophélès appears, ironically commenting on Faust&#x27;s apparent conversion. He offers to take him on a journey, promising him the restoration of his youth, knowledge, and the fulfillment of all his wishes. Faust accepts.

Méphistophélès and Faust arrive at Auerbach&#x27;s tavern in Leipzig, where Brander, a student, sings a song about a rat whose high life in a kitchen is ended by a dose of poison. The other guests offer an ironic &quot;Amen&quot;, and Méphistophélès continues with another song about a flea that brings his relatives to infest a whole royal court (Song of the Flea). Disgusted by the vulgarity of it all, Faust demands to be taken somewhere else.

On a meadow by the Elbe, Méphistophélès shows Faust a dream vision of a beautiful woman named Marguerite, causing Faust to fall in love with her. He calls out her name, and Méphistophélès promises to lead Faust to her. Together with a group of students and soldiers, they enter the town where she lives.

===Part III===
Faust and Méphistophélès hide in Marguerite&#x27;s room. Faust feels that he will find in her, his ideal of a pure and innocent woman (&quot;Merci, doux crépuscule!&quot;). Marguerite enters and sings a ballad about the King of Thule, who always remained sadly faithful to his lost love (&quot;Autrefois, un roi de Thulé&quot;). Méphistophélès summons spirits to enchant and deceive the girl and sings a sarcastic serenade outside her window, predicting her loss of innocence. When the spirits have vanished, Faust steps forward. Marguerite admits that she has dreamed of him, just as he has dreamed of her, and they declare their love for each other. Just then, Méphistophélès bursts in, warning them that the girl&#x27;s reputation must be saved: the neighbors have learned that there is a man in Marguerite&#x27;s room and have called her mother to the scene. After a hasty goodbye, Faust and Méphistophélès escape.

===Part IV===
Faust has seduced, then abandoned Marguerite, who still awaits his return (&quot;D&#x27;amour l&#x27;ardente flamme&quot;). She can hear soldiers and students in the distance, which reminds her of the night Faust first came to her house. But this time he is not among them.

Faust calls upon nature to cure him of his world-weariness (&quot;Nature immense, impénétrable et fière&quot;). Méphistophélès appears and tells him that Marguerite is in prison. While awaiting Faust&#x27;s return, she has given her mother the sleeping potion Faust had previously provided to calm her mother during their nights of love, and used it so often that she has killed the old woman, and now is to be hanged the next day. Faust panics, but Méphistophélès claims he can save her—if Faust relinquishes his soul to him. Unable to think of anything but saving Marguerite, Faust agrees. The two ride off on a pair of black horses.

Thinking they are on their way to Marguerite, Faust becomes terrified when he sees demonic apparitions. The landscape becomes more and more horrible and grotesque, and Faust finally realizes that Méphistophélès has taken him directly into hell. Demons and damned spirits greet Méphistophélès in a mysterious infernal language and welcome Faust among them.

Hell has fallen silent after Faust&#x27;s arrival—the torment he suffers is unspeakable. Marguerite is saved and welcomed into heaven.

<text>Manon () is an &quot;opéra comique&quot; in five acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Henri Meilhac and Philippe Gille, based on the 1731 novel &quot;L&#x27;histoire du chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut&quot; by the Abbé Prévost. It was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 19 January 1884, with sets designed by Eugène Carpezat (act 1), Auguste Alfred Rubé and Philippe Chaperon (acts 2 and 3), and Jean-Baptiste Lavastre (act 4).

Prior to Massenet&#x27;s work, Halévy (&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, ballet, 1830) and Auber (&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, opéra comique, 1856) had used the subject for musical stage works. Massenet also wrote a one-act sequel to &quot;Manon&quot;, &quot;Le portrait de Manon&quot; (1894), involving the Chevalier des Grieux as an older man.

The composer worked at the score of &quot;Manon&quot; at his country home outside Paris and also at a house at The Hague once occupied by Prévost himself.

&quot;Manon&quot; is Massenet&#x27;s most popular and enduring opera and, having &quot;quickly conquered the world&#x27;s stages&quot;, it has maintained an important place in the repertory since its creation. It is the quintessential example of the charm and vitality of the music and culture of the Parisian Belle Époque. In 1893 an opera by Giacomo Puccini entitled &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, and based on the same novel was premiered and has also become popular.

==Performance history==

The opera was a mainstay of the Opéra-Comique in Paris, reaching its 1,000th performance there in 1919, its 1,500th in 1931 and 2,000th in 1952.

The first Manon was Marie Heilbron; other noted interpreters include Sibyl Sanderson (Massenet&#x27;s personal favorite), Fanny Heldy, Lucrezia Bori, Amelita Galli-Curci, Bidu Sayão, Victoria de los Ángeles, Anna Moffo, Beverly Sills, Edita Gruberová, Renée Fleming, Anna Netrebko, and Natalie Dessay. Due to its heavy vocal demands, the role of Manon was described by Sills as &quot;the French Isolde&quot;. As famous interpreters of Des Grieux, Kobbé lists Edmond Clément, Enrico Caruso, Beniamino Gigli, Tito Schipa and Ferruccio Tagliavini; Wolff also lists Gaston Micheletti, Adolphe Maréchal, Charles Fontaine and Libero de Luca.

Within a year of its Paris premiere, &quot;Manon&quot; was given its UK premiere in January 1885, in Liverpool; in the US, the Academy of Music in New York presented the opera later the same year, on 23 December. At the Royal Opera House in London it was first presented 19 May 1891. The Metropolitan Opera gave its first staging on 16 January 1895, and &quot;Manon&quot; has subsequently often been performed there. Anna Netrebko starred in a new production directed by Laurent Pelly, a co-production with the Royal Opera House, which was simulcast in HD on 7 April 2012. The San Francisco Opera gave the opera many stagings beginning on 29 September 1924.

In the 1980s a piano score was discovered where spoken dialogue was set as recitative by Massenet, possibly for the Italian premiere; this version was performed at the Opéra de Saint-Etienne as part of the 2009 Massenet Festival.

Today, &quot;Manon&quot; is frequently performed.

The ballet &quot;L&#x27;histoire de Manon&quot; by Kenneth MacMillan, although using music entirely written by Massenet, does not include any from &quot;Manon&quot;.

== Roles ==

==Synopsis==
:Place: France
:Time: the reign of Louis XV

===Act 1===
&quot;The courtyard of an inn at Amiens&quot;

De Brétigny, a nobleman, has just arrived, in the company of Guillot, an aging rake who is the Minister of Finance, along with three flirtatious young actresses. While the innkeeper is serving dinner to the party, the townspeople collect to witness the arrival of the coach from Arras. Among them is Lescaut, a guardsman, who tells his comrades that he plans to meet a kinswoman. The coach appears, and among the crowd Lescaut quickly identifies his fragile young cousin, Manon, who appears to be somewhat confused (&quot;&quot;Je suis encor tout étourdie&quot;) since this is her first journey, one which is taking her to the convent.

Manon is accosted by the opportunistic Guillot, who tells her that he has a carriage waiting, in which they can leave together. His heavy-handed seduction is undermined by the return of Lescaut, who then lectures the young woman (&quot;Regardez-moi bien dans les yeux&quot;) on proper behavior. He leaves her unattended once more and she admires the three fashionably-dressed actresses, but reproaches herself (&quot;Voyons, Manon&quot;), unconvincingly vowing to rid herself of all worldly visions.

Des Grieux, traveling home to see his father, catches sight of Manon, and instantly falls in love. When he approaches, she is charmed by his chivalrous address (&quot;Et je sais votre nom&quot;), and their exchange rapidly becomes a mutual avowal of love. Both their planned journeys, hers to the convent and des Grieux&#x27;s to his home, are swiftly abandoned, as they decide to flee together (&quot;Nous vivrons à Paris&quot;&quot;). But there are hints of incompatible aspirations: while he returns, over and again, to &quot;tous les deux&quot; (together), the phrase she fondly repeats is, &quot;à Paris&quot;. Making good use of the carriage provided by the disappointed Guillot, the lovers escape.

===Act 2===
&quot;Manon and des Grieux&#x27;s apartment in Paris&quot;

With little hope, des Grieux writes to his father, imploring permission to marry Manon. Lescaut enters intent on creating a scene and accompanied by de Brétigny, who is masquerading as a fellow-guardsman. But his concern for offended family honor is only camouflage for his alliance with his friend. Trying to prove his honorable intentions, des Grieux shows Lescaut the letter to his father. Meanwhile, de Brétigny warns Manon that des Grieux is going to be abducted that evening, on the orders of his father, and offers her his protection and wealth, trying to persuade her to move on to a better future.

After the two visitors depart, Manon appears to vacillate between accepting de Brétigny&#x27;s offer and warning des Grieux. When her lover goes out to post his letter, her farewell to the humble domesticity she has shared (&quot;&quot;Adieu, notre petite table&quot;) makes clear she has decided to go with de Brétigny. Unaware of her change of heart, des Grieux returns and conveys his more modest vision of their future happiness (&quot;En fermant les yeux&quot;&quot;, the &quot;Dream Song&quot;). Going outside to investigate an apparent disturbance, he is seized and hustled away, leaving Manon to voice her regrets.

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 1: Paris, the promenade of the Cours-la-Reine on a feast-day&quot;

Among the throng of holiday-makers and vendors of all kinds are Lescaut and Guillot, the latter still flirting with the young actresses, while Lescaut expresses the joys of gambling (&quot;&quot;À quoi bon l&#x27;économie?&quot;). De Brétigny arrives, soon joined by Manon, now sumptuously dressed and with a retinue of admirers. She sings about her new situation (&quot;Je marche sur tous les chemins&quot;), following it with a gavotte (&quot;Obéissons quand leur voix appelle&quot;) on the joys of love and youth.

Des Grieux&#x27;s father, the Comte, greets de Brétigny and Manon overhears that her former lover is &quot;Chevalier&quot; no longer, but &quot;Abbé&quot;, having entered the seminary of Saint-Sulpice. Approaching the Comte, Manon tries to discover whether his son still loves her. Guillot then attempts to win Manon over by bringing the ballet dancers of the Académie Royale de Musique, which she had expressed a desire to see. However Manon is seized by the desire to see des Grieux once more, and admits, to Guillot&#x27;s annoyance when asked, that she paid no attention to the dancers. She hurries off to Saint-Sulpice.

&quot;Scene 2: Saint-Sulpice&quot;

From the chapel, the congregation is leaving, enthusiastic over the sermon of the new abbé (&quot;Quelle éloquence!&quot;). Des Grieux enters, in clerical garb, and his father adds his voice to the chorus of praise, but tries to dissuade his son from this new life, so that he can perpetuate the family name (&quot;Epouse quelque brave fille&quot;).

He leaves, having failed to shake his son&#x27;s resolve and, alone, des Grieux relives memories of Manon (&quot;Ah! Fuyez, douce image&quot;). As he prays, Manon herself appears, to implore his forgiveness for her faithlessness. Furiously, he attempts to reject her, but when (in &quot;N&#x27;est-ce plus ma main?&quot;) she recalls their past intimacies, his resistance is overcome, and their voices join in an impassioned avowal of love.

===Act 4===
&quot;A gaming salon at the Hôtel de Transylvanie&quot;

Lescaut and Guillot are among the gamblers, and the three young actresses are prepared to attach themselves to any winner. Manon arrives with des Grieux who declares his total love: (&quot;Manon! Manon! Sphinx étonnant&quot;). He is persuaded to gamble, in hopes of gaining the wealth she craves. He plays at cards with Guillot and continually wins, as Guillot doubles and redoubles the wager. As Manon exults, Guillot accuses des Grieux of cheating. Des Grieux denies the charge and Guillot leaves, returning shortly with the police, to whom he denounces des Grieux as a cheat and Manon as dissolute.

The elder des Grieux enters, and tells his son that, while he will intercede on his behalf, he will do nothing to save Manon. In a big ensemble, with Guillot exulting over his revenge, Manon lamenting the end of all joy, des Grieux swearing to defend her, and the rest expressing consternation and horror, the arrested pair are led away.

===Act 5===
:[Act 4, Scene 2 in the original version]

&quot;A desolate spot near the road to Le Havre&quot;

Convicted as a woman of ill-fame, Manon has been condemned to be deported. Des Grieux, freed by his father&#x27;s intervention, and a penitent Lescaut, now his ally, wait to waylay the convoy in which Manon is being marched to the port. A detachment of soldiers arrives with their prisoners. The would-be rescuers recognize the hopelessness of attacking so strong an escort, but Lescaut succeeds in bribing their sergeant to allow Manon to stay behind till evening. The convoy moves on, and a sick and exhausted Manon falls to the ground at des Grieux&#x27;s feet.

In his arms, near delirium, she relives their former happiness. Des Grieux tells her the past can exist again but Manon, now calm, knows that it is too late. With the words &quot;Et c&#x27;est là l&#x27;histoire de Manon Lescaut&quot;&quot;, she dies.

<doc id="355210" wikidata="Q641205" url="?curid=355210" title="1941 Iraqi coup d'état">
<text>The 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état (, &quot;Thawrah Rašīd ʿAlī al-Kaylānī&quot;), also called the Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani coup or the Golden Square coup, was a nationalist coup d&#x27;état in Iraq on 1 April 1941 that overthrew the pro-British regime of Regent &#x27;Abd al-Ilah and his Prime Minister Nuri al-Said and installed Rashid Ali al-Gaylani as Prime Minister.

The coup was led by four Iraqi nationalist army generals, known as &quot;the Golden Square&quot;, who intended to use the war to press for full Iraqi independence following the limited independence granted in 1932. To that end, they worked with German intelligence and accepted military assistance from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The change in government led to the British invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation until 1947.

==The coup==
From 1939 to 1941 a pro-British government headed by the Regent &#x27;Abd al-Ilah and Prime Minister Nuri as-Said ruled Iraq. Iraq severed relations with Germany on 5 September 1939, following the outbreak of World War II in Europe. However, Nuri had to tread carefully between his close relationship with Britain and dependence on pro-German Army officers and cabinet members. By that time, Iraq became a refuge to Arab leaders who fled Mandatory Palestine as a result of the failed Palestinian Arab revolt against the British. Among the key figures to arrive was the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Palestinian Arab nationalist leader of the failed revolt.

The Golden Square coup was launched on 1 April 1941, overthrowing the Regent and installing Rashid Ali al-Gaylani as Prime Minister. 

On 2 May of the same year, Prime Minister Taha al-Hashimi was forced to resign after the conspirators surrounded the Royal Palace in Baghdad.

==British response==

===Empire forces sent to quell the revolt===

On 18 April, Britain reacted by landing the Indian 20th Infantry Brigade at Basra, they first used Native Assyrian Levies especially in Habbaniyah, with elements of Iraqforce. Britain claimed it was entitled to do this under its defence treaty with Iraq.

===Siege of Habbaniya===
In the following days, the new Iraqi government moved substantial ground forces, including an infantry brigade, an artillery brigade, and 12 armoured cars as well as tanks to the plateau overlooking RAF Habbaniya, the large British Royal Air Force (RAF) base beside the River Euphrates west of Baghdad. Upon arrival, the Iraqis demanded that the British not move any troops nor aircraft in or out of the base. The British responded by first demanding that the Iraqis leave the area and then, following the expiry of an ultimatum given in the early hours of 2 May, launched an attack. The base had a force of 96 lightly-armed aircraft, most of which were either purpose-built trainers or obsolete combat aircraft converted to training use. They also had an understrength battalion from the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), six companies of Assyrian Levies (troops raised by the British), 18 armoured cars and a company of RAF personnel, giving a total strength of 2,200 troops to defend the base. The Royal Iraqi Air Force, despite having aircraft that included numerous modern British-, Italian- and US-built machines, failed to defeat the RAF. By the second day of fighting (3 May), four Blenheim fighter bombers arrived.

With British forces having air superiority, the Iraqi army was forced back to Fallujah and the RAF attacked the Iraqi Air Force bases at Mosul and Rashid. Habbaniya had essentially lifted the siege with its own resources.

Reinforcements, officially called &quot;Iraqforce&quot;, came from two directions. British and Arab Legion forces arrived in two columns (&quot;Habforce&quot; and &quot;Kingcol&quot;) across the desert from Palestine and Transjordan. Additional Indian forces continued to arrive in Basra.

The Iraqi army was driven out of Fallujah and pursued to Baghdad, which fell within a week. This cleared the way for the nominal restoration of the Regent and the pro-British government. British military occupation of Iraq continued until late 1947.

==German and Italian support for the nationalists==

In the course of the Iraq war, minor reinforcements for the nationalists were received from first Germany and then Italy. Arriving aircraft were crudely painted with Iraqi colours. Small numbers of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German air force) bombers and heavy fighters, followed a few days later by obsolescent &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (Italian air force) biplane fighters, flew sorties from Mosul against both RAF Habbaniya and the relieving Empire forces moving across from Transjordan. This was done to little effect.

The Vichy French authorities in the Syria and Lebanon had helped the pro-Axis Iraqi nationalists and the German and Italian air forces, providing airfields for staging and refuelling. Even before the end of the Iraq campaign, this led to RAF attacks on airbases in Syria. Within weeks these events led to British and Empire forces invading Vichy-administered Syria and Lebanon in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign.
