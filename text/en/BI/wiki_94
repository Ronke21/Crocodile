<text>Werther is an opera (&quot;drame lyrique&quot;) in four acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Édouard Blau, Paul Milliet and Georges Hartmann (who used the pseudonym Henri Grémont). It is loosely based on Goethe&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;, which was based both on fact and on Goethe&#x27;s own early life. Earlier examples of operas using the story were made by Kreutzer (1792) and Pucitta (1802).

==Performance history==
Massenet started composing &quot;Werther&quot; in 1885, completing it in 1887. He submitted it to Léon Carvalho, the director of the Paris Opéra-Comique, that year, but Carvalho declined to accept it on the grounds that the scenario was too serious. With the disruption of the fire at the Opéra-Comique and Massenet&#x27;s work on other operatic projects (especially &quot;Esclarmonde&quot;), it was put to one side, until the Vienna Opera, pleased with the success of &quot;Manon&quot;, asked the composer for a new work. &quot;Werther&quot; received its premiere on 16 February 1892 (in a German version translated by Max Kalbeck) at the Imperial Theatre Hofoper in Vienna.

The French-language premiere followed in Geneva on 27 December 1892. The first performance in France was given by the Opéra-Comique at the Théâtre Lyrique on the Place du Châtelet in Paris on 16 January 1893, with Marie Delna as Charlotte and Guillaume Ibos in the title role, conducted by Jules Danbé, but was not immediately successful.

&quot;Werther&quot; entered the repertoire at the Opéra-Comique in 1903 in a production supervised by Albert Carré, and over the next half-century the opera was performed over 1,100 times there, Léon Beyle becoming a distinguished interpreter of Werther.

The United States premiere with the Metropolitan Opera took place in Chicago on 29 March 1894 and then in the company&#x27;s main house in New York City three weeks later. The UK premiere was a one-off performance at Covent Garden, London, on 11 June 1894 with Emma Eames as Charlotte, Sigrid Arnoldson as Sophie, and Jean de Reszke in the title role.

&quot;Werther&quot; is still regularly performed around the world and has been recorded many times. Although the role of Werther was written for a tenor, Massenet adjusted it for a baritone, when Mattia Battistini sang it in Saint Petersburg in 1902. It is very occasionally performed in this version, in which the changes affect only the vocal line for the title character. There are no other changes to the words, to the lines for other characters, or to the orchestration.

==Synopsis==
:Time: Within the period July to December, in an undefined year in the 1780s.
:Place: Wetzlar in Germany.
===Act 1===
In July, the widowed Bailiff (a Magistrate, rather than one who comes to seize property), is teaching his six youngest children a Christmas carol (&quot;Noël! Jésus vient de naître&quot;). His drinking companions, Johann and Schmidt, arrive as Charlotte, the eldest daughter, dresses for a ball. Since her fiancé Albert is away, she is to be escorted by Werther, whom the Bailiff and his companions find gloomy. Werther arrives (&quot;O Nature, pleine de grâce&quot;), and watches as Charlotte prepares her young siblings&#x27; supper, just as her mother had before she died. He greets her and they leave for the ball. Albert returns unexpectedly after a six-month trip. He is unsure of Charlotte&#x27;s intentions and disappointed not to find her at home, but is reassured and consoled by Charlotte&#x27;s younger sister Sophie. He leaves after promising to return in the morning. After an orchestral interlude, Werther and Charlotte return very late; he is already enamoured of her. His declaration of love is interrupted by the announcement of Albert&#x27;s return. Charlotte recalls how she promised her dying mother she would marry Albert. Werther is in despair.

===Act 2===
It is three months later, and Charlotte and Albert are now married. They walk happily to church to celebrate the minister&#x27;s 50th wedding anniversary, followed by the disconsolate Werther (&quot;Un autre est son époux!&quot;). First Albert and then Sophie (&quot;Du gai soleil, plein de flamme&quot;) try to cheer him up. When Charlotte exits the church, he speaks to her of their first meeting. Charlotte begs Werther to leave her, though she indicates that she would be willing to receive him again on Christmas Day. Werther contemplates suicide (&quot;Lorsque l&#x27;enfant revient d&#x27;un voyage&quot;). He encounters Sophie but the tearful girl does not understand his distressing behavior. Albert now realizes that Werther loves Charlotte.

===Act 3===

Charlotte is at home alone on Christmas Eve. She spends time rereading the letters that she has received from Werther (&quot;Werther! Qui m&#x27;aurait dit ... Ces lettres!&quot;), wondering how the young poet is and how she had the strength to send him away. Sophie comes in and tries to cheer up her older sister (&quot;Ah! le rire est béni&quot;), though Charlotte is not to be consoled (&quot;Va! laisse couler mes larmes&quot;). Suddenly Werther appears, and while he reads to her some poetry of Ossian (&quot;Pourquoi me réveiller?&quot;), he realizes that she does indeed return his love. They embrace for a moment, but she quickly bids him farewell. He leaves with thoughts of suicide. Albert returns home to find his wife distraught. Werther sends a messenger to Albert, requesting to borrow his pistols, explaining he is going on an extended trip. After the servant has taken them, Charlotte has a terrible premonition and hurries to find Werther. An orchestral intermezzo (&quot;La nuit de Noël&quot;) leads without a break into the final Act.

===Act 4===
&quot;The death of Werther&quot;: At Werther&#x27;s apartment, Charlotte has arrived too late to stop him from shooting himself; he is dying. She consoles him by declaring her love. He asks for forgiveness. After he dies, Charlotte faints. Outside children are heard singing the Christmas carol.

==Noted arias==
Act 1
:Werther: &quot;O Nature, pleine de grâce&quot;
Act 2
:Werther: &quot;Un autre est son époux!&quot;
:Sophie: &quot;Du gai soleil, plein de flamme&quot;
:Werther: &quot;Lorsque l&#x27;enfant revient d&#x27;un voyage&quot;

Act 3
:Charlotte: &quot;Werther! Qui m&#x27;aurait dit /Ces lettres!&quot; (Letter Scene)
:Charlotte: &quot;Va! laisse couler mes larmes&quot;
:Werther: &quot;Pourquoi me réveiller?&quot;
==Recordings==

A well-regarded recording of the complete opera was made in January 1931 by French Columbia with a French cast and the orchestra and chorus of the Opéra-Comique under the direction of Élie Cohen. Henry Fogel of &quot;Fanfare&quot; magazine, writing in 1992, counted 14 complete recordings and considered it the finest of the lot. His colleague, James Camner, reviewing the Opera d&#x27;Oro reissue in 2003, called it &quot;one of the treasures of recorded opera. ... Unfortunately, the transfer is over filtered. The high frequencies are lost, giving the performance an unwarranted flatness. Happily, Naxos offers the same recording expertly transferred by Ward Marston, and acquiring it is a must.&quot; Alan Blyth, while giving a very positive review of the reissue of the recording with Albert Lance as Werther and Rita Gorr as Charlotte in 2004, nevertheless pointed out that &quot;neither quite has the ideal subtlety of the best Massenet singers, such as Vallin and Thill on the classic, pre-war set, now on Naxos&quot;.

In addition, many of the greatest French and Italian singers of the past century or more have recorded individual arias from Massenet&#x27;s masterwork.

<doc id="355216" wikidata="Q1144467" url="?curid=355216" title="Thaïs (opera)">
<text>Thaïs () is an opera, a &quot;comédie lyrique&quot; in three acts and seven tableaux, by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Louis Gallet, based on the novel &quot;Thaïs&quot; by Anatole France. It was first performed at the Opéra Garnier in Paris on 16 March 1894, starring the American soprano Sibyl Sanderson, for whom Massenet had written the title role. The original production was directed by Alexandre Lapissida, with costumes designed by Charles Bianchini and sets by Marcel Jambon (act 1, scene 1; act 3) and Eugène Carpezat (act 1, scene 2; act 2). The opera was later revised by the composer and was premiered at the same opera house on 13 April 1898.

The work was first performed in Italy at the Teatro Lirico Internazionale in Milan on 17 October 1903 with Lina Cavalieri in the title role and Francesco Maria Bonini as Athanaël. In 1907, the role served as Mary Garden&#x27;s American debut in New York in the U.S. premiere performance.

&quot;Thaïs&quot; takes place in Egypt under the rule of the Roman Empire, where a Cenobite monk, Athanaël, attempts to convert Thaïs, an Alexandrian courtesan and devotee of Venus, to Christianity, but discovers too late that his obsession with her is rooted in lust; while the courtesan&#x27;s true purity of heart is revealed, so is the religious man&#x27;s baser nature. The work is often described as bearing a sort of religious eroticism, and has had many controversial productions. Its famous Méditation, the &quot;entr&#x27;acte&quot; for violin and orchestra played between the scenes of act 2, is an oft-performed concert music piece; it has been arranged for many different instruments.

The role of Thaïs, similar to another Massenet heroine also written for Sibyl Sanderson, &quot;Esclarmonde&quot;, is notoriously difficult to sing and is reserved for only the most gifted of performers. Modern interpreters have included Carol Neblett, Anna Moffo, Beverly Sills, Leontyne Price, Renée Fleming, and Elizabeth Futral. Géori Boué was the first to record the opera, in 1952.

== Differences between two versions ==

In the 1894 version the end of act 1, the supposed striptease of Thaïs (which caused a great scandal on the first night due to a mishap with Sibyl Sanderson&#x27;s costume) is a long symphonic interlude &quot;L&#x27;amours d&#x27;Aphrodite&quot; that leads without a break into act 2 and the scene with the mirror aria &quot;Dis-moi que je suis belle&quot;. In the first edition vocal score, this is 18 pages – 196 bars – almost a fifth of the entire first act. There is a strangely experimental middle section, that is in an amorphous 5/4 time signature (unusual for Massenet) with a sultry whole-tone feel. In 1898 this was cut, though the climax is retained in part as the peroration for act 1 – a mere 17 bars.

In Thaïs&#x27;s famous Mirror Aria at the opening of act 2 there are some text changes, though this does not affect the music.

In the 1898 revision, there is an extended ballet sequence in act 2 for Nicias&#x27; followers, including the little vocal intermezzo for La charmeuse. This replaced the 1894 ballet in the last act. The 1898 ballet is entirely new music.

The most comprehensive revisions concern the final act, act 3. In 1894, there is no scene at the Oasis, the act opens with the monks in the Thébaïde. When Athanaël falls asleep there is an extended ballet sequence &quot;Les Sept esprits de la Tentation&quot; – which is modeled on Flaubert&#x27;s epic poem &quot;La tentation de Saint Antoine&quot;. In it Athanaël is tormented by spirit voices, La perdition, L&#x27;étoile de la rédemption (star of redemption), Les sphinges (Sphinxes), Âmes perdues (lost souls) and Esprits de L&#x27;abîme (spirits of the abyss) culminating in an orgiastic black sabbath.

This was cut. The first scene becomes scene 2. The new scene 1 (the Oasis scene) shows Athanaël delivering Thaïs to Mère Albine and &quot;les filles blanches&quot;, and leaving her.

1894: In the final scene, after the famous final duet &quot;Te souvient-il du lumineux voyage&quot; there is extra music and text. Voices from heaven curse Athanaël, Mère Albine and the nuns cry out &quot;Un vampire&quot; and run away (as in the final chapter of the Anatole France novel) and the opera concludes with voices of angels calling &quot;Pitié&quot; and a soft reminiscence of the famous Méditation. In 1898, this is all cut and reduced to Athanaël&#x27;s single cry of &quot;Pitié&quot; and a brief three bar coda.

== Roles ==
==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
Scene 1

A group of Cenobite monks go about their daily business. Athanaël, the most rigorous ascetic of them all, enters and confesses to the senior monk, Palémon, that he has lately been disturbed by visions of a courtesan and priestess of Venus named Thaïs, whom he had seen many years ago in his native city of Alexandria. Believing these visions to be a sign from God, he resolves, against Palémon&#x27;s advice, to return to Alexandria, convert Thaïs to Christianity, and persuade her to enter a convent.

Scene 2

Athanaël arrives in Alexandria and visits his old friend Nicias, a wealthy . Nicias welcomes him with open arms and reveals himself to be Thaïs&#x27;s current lover. Upon hearing Athanaël&#x27;s plan, he laughs and warns him that the revenge of Venus can be terrible. Nevertheless, he procures clothing for his friend in preparation for a feast that evening at which Thaïs will appear. His slaves, Crobyle and Myrtale, dress Athanaël and mock his prudery.

The feast begins. Thaïs arrives and sings a bittersweet love duet with Nicias: this is their last night together. She then asks him about Athanaël, who overhears her and tells her that he has come to teach her &quot;contempt for the flesh and love of pain.&quot; Not tempted by this proposition, she offends his sense of propriety with a seductive song. He leaves, angrily promising to come back later, while she taunts him with a parting shot: &quot;Dare to come, you who defy Venus!&quot; and begins to disrobe as the curtain falls.

===Act 2===
Scene 1

Exhausted after the feast, Thaïs expresses dissatisfaction with her empty life and muses on the fact that one day, old age will destroy her beauty. Athanaël enters at this vulnerable moment, praying to God to conceal her beauty from him. He tells her that he loves her according to the spirit rather than the flesh, and that his love will last forever instead of a single night. Intrigued, she asks him to teach her the ways of this love. He nearly succumbs to her physical charm, but succeeds in explaining to her that if she converts, she will gain eternal life. She nearly succumbs to his eloquence, but then reasserts her nihilistic worldview and drives him away. However, after a long meditation she changes her mind.

Scene 2

Thaïs has joined Athanaël and resolved to follow him into the desert. He orders her to burn down her house and possessions in order to destroy all traces of her wicked past. She agrees, but asks if she can keep a statuette of Eros, the god of love, explaining to Athanaël that she sinned against love rather than through it. When he hears that Nicias gave it to her, however, Athanaël demands that she destroy it. Nicias appears with a group of revelers, who see Athanaël taking Thaïs away. Furious, they begin to stone him. Although Nicias is astonished at Thaïs&#x27; decision to leave, he respects it and throws handfuls of money to distract the crowd. Thaïs and Athanaël escape.

===Act 3===
Scene 1

Thaïs and Athanaël travel on foot through the desert. Thaïs is exhausted, but Athanaël forces her to keep going and thus do penance for her sins. They reach a spring, where Athanaël begins to feel pity rather than disgust for her, and they share a few moments of idyllic, platonic companionship as they rest. Shortly afterwards, they reach the convent where Thaïs is to stay. Placing her in the care of Mother Superior Albine, Athanaël realizes that he has accomplished his mission – and that he will never see her again.

Scene 2

The Cenobite monks express anxiety over Athanaël&#x27;s asocial and morose behavior since his return from Alexandria. Athanaël enters and confesses to Palémon that he has begun to experience sexual longing for Thaïs. Palémon castigates him for having attempted to convert her in the first place. Athanaël falls into a depressed sleep and has an erotic vision of Thaïs. He tries to seize her, but she laughingly evades him. Then, a second vision tells him that Thaïs is dying.

Scene 3

Feeling that existence is worth nothing without her, he repudiates all his vows and rushes off to find her. He reaches the convent and finds her on her deathbed. He tells her that all he taught her was a lie, that &quot;nothing is true but life and the love of human beings&quot;, and that he loves her. Blissfully unaware, she describes the heavens opening and the angels welcoming her into their midst. She dies, and Athanaël collapses in despair.

<doc id="355225" wikidata="Q3532143" url="?curid=355225" title="List of renamed places in Zimbabwe">
<text>Place names in Zimbabwe, including the name of the country itself, have been altered at various points in history. The name Zimbabwe was officially adopted concurrently with Britain&#x27;s grant of independence in April 1980. Prior to that point, the country had been called Southern Rhodesia from 1898 to 1964 (or 1980, according to British law), Rhodesia from 1964 to 1979, and Zimbabwe Rhodesia between June and December 1979. Since Zimbabwean independence in 1980, the names of cities, towns, streets and other places have been changed by the government, most prominently in a burst of renaming in 1982.

The Zimbabwean government began renaming cities, towns, streets and other places in 1982, hoping to remove vestiges of British and Rhodesian rule. The capital city, Salisbury, was renamed Harare. Many other place names merely had their spellings altered to reflect the orthography of Shona or Kalanga, as under white rule the spellings officially adopted were derived from Sindebele orthography. Most major cities and towns were renamed, but some places with an Ndebele majority—such as Bulawayo, the country&#x27;s second city—were not. Some smaller towns retain their colonial-era names, such as Beitbridge, West Nicholson and Fort Rixon. Street names were changed wholesale, with British-style names, particularly those of colonial figures, being phased out in favour of those of black nationalist leaders, prominently Robert Mugabe, Joshua Nkomo and Jason Moyo.

==Name of the country==

The name of the country has changed several times since it was originally demarcated in the late-nineteenth century by Cecil Rhodes&#x27; British South Africa Company. The company initially referred to each territory it acquired by its respective name—Mashonaland, Matabeleland and so on—and collectively called its lands &quot;Zambesia&quot; (Rhodes&#x27; personal preference) or &quot;Charterland&quot; (Leander Starr Jameson&#x27;s), but neither of these caught on. Most of the first settlers instead called their new home Rhodesia, after Rhodes; this was common enough usage by 1891 to be used by journalists. In 1892, the &quot;Rhodesia Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Rhodesia Herald&quot; newspapers were first published, respectively at Tuli and Salisbury. The company officially applied the name Rhodesia in 1895. &quot;It is not clear why the name should have been pronounced with the emphasis on the second rather than the first syllable,&quot; Robert Blake comments, &quot;but this appears to have been the custom from the beginning and it never changed.&quot;

Matabeleland and Mashonaland, both of which lay south of the Zambezi, were first officially referred to collectively by Britain as Southern Rhodesia in 1898. Southern Rhodesia attained responsible government as a self-governing colony in 1923, while Northern Rhodesia (to the Zambezi&#x27;s north) became a directly administered British colony the following year.

The name &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;, based on a Shona term for Great Zimbabwe, an ancient ruined city in the country&#x27;s south-east, was first recorded as a term of national reference in 1960, when it was coined by the black nationalist Michael Mawema, whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961. The term Rhodesia, derived from Rhodes&#x27; surname, was perceived as inappropriate because of its colonial origin and connotations. According to Mawema, black nationalists held a meeting in 1960 to choose an alternative name for the country, and the names Machobana and Monomotapa were proposed before his suggestion, Zimbabwe, prevailed. A further alternative, put forward by nationalists in Matabeleland, had been &quot;Matopos&quot;, referring to the Matopos Hills to the south of Bulawayo.

It was initially not clear how the chosen term was to be used—a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers to &quot;Zimbabweland&quot;—but &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; was sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement. In a 2001 interview, black nationalist Edson Zvobgo recalled that the name was mentioned by Mawema during a political rally, &quot;and it caught hold, and that was that&quot;. The name was subsequently used by the black nationalist factions during the Second &quot;Chimurenga&quot; campaigns against the Rhodesian government during the Rhodesian Bush War. The most major of these were the Zimbabwe African National Union (led by Robert Mugabe from 1975), and the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union, led by Joshua Nkomo from its founding in the early-1960s.

When Northern Rhodesia achieved independence as Zambia in 1964, the Southern Rhodesian government introduced a bill to allow the country to be known simply as Rhodesia, which passed its third reading on 9 December 1964. Although no assent was given to the bill, the revised name was widely adopted, and following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, it was the name of the unrecognised government. This name was used until June 1979, when new institutions of government came into power following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, and the country adopted the name Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Following the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979 that the United Kingdom should preside over fresh elections before granting independence, direct British control started that month with reversion to the former name of Southern Rhodesia. The UK granted independence under the name Zimbabwe on 18 April 1980.

Starting in 1982, on the second anniversary of the country&#x27;s independence as Zimbabwe, the government began renaming cities, towns and streets in an attempt to eradicate symbols of British colonialism and white minority rule. The capital Salisbury, which had been named after the British Prime Minister, the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, was renamed Harare, after the Shona chief Neharawa. Other place names were simply new transliterations, to reflect the orthography of the local language—many places had been gazetted with Sindebele orthography during the colonial period. This generally included the letter &quot;l&quot;, which is not used in Shona, being used instead of &quot;r&quot;.

While most larger cities and towns were renamed, the spelling of Zimbabwe&#x27;s second-largest city, Bulawayo, remains unchanged because its Sindebele orthography reflects the dominant ethnicity. Towns which have retained names of European origin include mostly smaller communities such as Beitbridge, Colleen Bawn, West Nicholson, Fort Rixon, Craigmore, Cashel, Juliasdale, Glendale, and Birchenough Bridge. The colonial-era names of suburbs of Harare, such as Borrowdale, Highlands, Rietfontein, Tynwald, and Mount Pleasant also remained unchanged. An exception was Harari, which was renamed Mbare.

Street names were also changed, with names of British colonists such as Cecil Rhodes being replaced with those of Zimbabwean nationalist leaders, such as Jason Moyo, Josiah Tongogara, Simon Muzenda, and Leopold Takawira. Robert Mugabe&#x27;s name eventually became attached to the main street or town centre of every sizeable town as a result of a spate of changes in 1990. Other streets have been named after leaders of neighbouring countries, such as Samora Machel of Mozambique, Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Nelson Mandela of South Africa. Others have a general pan-African nationalist theme, such as Africa Unity Square in Harare, formerly Cecil Square.

<doc id="355228" wikidata="Q5564427" url="?curid=355228" title="Girl Scouts of the Philippines">
<text>The Girl Scouts of the Philippines (GSP) is the national Girl Scouting association for girls and young women in the Philippines. Its mission is &quot;to help girls and young women realize the ideals of womanhood and prepare themselves for their responsibilities in the home, to the nation, and to the world community&quot;. The girls-only association serves 800,000 members, as of 2017.

The first Girl Scout troops were organized in the Philippines as early as 1918 by American missionaries and servicemen. These Scout troops were directly registered with the Girl Scouts of the USA.

Pilar Hidalgo-Lim and Josefa Llanes Escoda spearheaded the organization of a Scout movement for girls, and requested the assistance of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (BSP). In 1939, Mrs. Escoda was sent to the United States and Britain for training through the help of Joseph Stevenot of the BSP. Upon her return to the Philippines, she immediately started setting up the GSP with the help of other civic organizations.

On May 26, 1940, the GSP was chartered under Philippine Commonwealth Act No. 542.

In 1946, the GSP was accepted as a tenderfoot member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) during the 11th World Conference held at Evian, France. In 1948, the GSP became a full member of WAGGGS during the 12th World Conference held at Cooperstown, New York.
Since 1995, the organization lost nearly half of its members; the membership number decreased from 1,275,113 in 1995 to 671,267 in 2003.

==Program==
The GSP&#x27;s program focuses on &quot;well-being, family life, heritage and citizenship, world community, preparedness, economic self-sufficiency, arts and environment&quot;. Center of the program is the &quot;eight-point challenge&quot;, a merit-badge program. The highest award is the &quot;Chief Girl Scout Medal&quot; which was introduced in 1976.

===Sections===
The association is divided in five sections according to age:
* Twinkler Scout – ages 4 to 6 (Pre-school), they wear a pink neckerchief
* Star Scout – ages 6 to 9 (Grades 1–3), they wear a yellow neckerchief
* Junior Girl Scout – ages 9 to 12 (Grades 4–6), they wear a golden-yellow neckerchief
* Senior Girl Scout – ages 12 to 15 (Grades 7–9), they wear an orange neckerchief
* Cadet Girl Scout – ages 15 to 26 (Grades 10–12 and college), they wear a purple neckerchief

===Scout Promise===
On my honor, I will do my duty:
to God and my country;
to help other people at all times;
and to live by the Girl Scout Law.

===Scout Law===
# A Girl Scout&#x27;s honor is to be trusted.&quot;Ang Girl Scout ay mapagkakatiwalaan.&quot;
# A Girl Scout is loyal.&quot;Ang Girl Scout ay matapát.&quot;
# A Girl Scout is helpful.&quot;Ang Girl Scout ay matulungín.&quot;
# A Girl Scout is a friend to all and a sister to every other Girl Scout.&quot;Ang Girl Scout ay kaibigan ng lahát at kapatíd ng bawat Girl Scout.&quot;
# A Girl Scout is courteous.&quot;Ang Girl Scout ay mapitagan.&quot;
# A Girl Scout respects all living things.&quot;Ang Girl Scout ay magalang sa lahát na may buhay.&quot;
# A Girl Scout is disciplined.&quot;Ang Girl Scout ay disiplinado.&quot;
# A Girl Scout is self-reliant.&quot;Ang Girl Scout ay may sariling paninindigan.&quot;
# A Girl Scout is thrifty.&quot;Ang Girl Scout ay matipíd.&quot;
# A Girl Scout is clean in thought, words, and deeds. &quot;Ang Girl Scout ay malinis sa isip, sa salitâ at sa gawâ.

The old emblem used until 2010 had features from the Flag of the Philippines. The current emblem only uses the 3 stars from it in a green trefoil.

<doc id="355236" wikidata="Q194436" url="?curid=355236" title="Jules Massenet">
<text>Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are &quot;Manon&quot; (1884) and &quot;Werther&quot; (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music.

While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France&#x27;s principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country&#x27;s top musical prize, the , in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné.

By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted and intelligent products of the Belle Époque.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Massenet was born on 12 May 1842 at Montaud, then an outlying hamlet and now a part of the city of Saint-Étienne, in the Loire. He was the youngest of the four children of (1788–1863) and his second wife Eléonore-Adelaïde &quot;née&quot; Royer de Marancour (1809–1875); the elder children were Julie, Léon and Edmond. Massenet senior was a prosperous ironmonger; his wife was a talented amateur musician who gave Jules his first piano lessons. By early 1848 the family had moved to Paris, where they settled in a flat in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Massenet was educated at the Lycée Saint-Louis and, from either 1851 or 1853, the Paris Conservatoire. According to his colourful but unreliable memoirs, Massenet auditioned in October 1851, when he was nine, before a judging panel comprising Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas and Michele Carafa, and was admitted at once. His biographer Demar Irvine dates the audition and admission as January 1853. Both sources agree that Massenet continued his general education at the lycée in tandem with his musical studies.
At the Conservatoire Massenet studied solfège with Augustin Savard and the piano with François Laurent. He pursued his studies, with modest distinction, until the beginning of 1855, when family concerns disrupted his education. Alexis Massenet&#x27;s health was poor, and on medical advice he moved from Paris to Chambéry in the south of France; the family, including Massenet, moved with him. Again, Massenet&#x27;s own memoirs and the researches of his biographers are at variance: the composer recalled his exile in Chambéry as lasting for two years; Henry Finck and Irvine record that the young man returned to Paris and the Conservatoire in October 1855. On his return he lodged with relations in Montmartre and resumed his studies; by 1859 he had progressed so far as to win the Conservatoire&#x27;s top prize for pianists. The family&#x27;s finances were no longer comfortable, and to support himself Massenet took private piano students and played as a percussionist in theatre orchestras. His work in the orchestra pit gave him a good working knowledge of the operas of Gounod and other composers, classic and contemporary. Traditionally, many students at the Conservatoire went on to substantial careers as church organists; with that in mind Massenet enrolled for organ classes, but they were not a success and he quickly abandoned the instrument. He gained some work as a piano accompanist, in the course of which he met Wagner who, along with Berlioz, was one of his two musical heroes.

In 1861 Massenet&#x27;s music was published for the first time, the &quot;Grande Fantasie de Concert sur le Pardon de Ploërmel de Meyerbeer&quot;, a virtuoso piano work in nine sections. Having graduated to the composition class under Ambroise Thomas, Massenet was entered for the Conservatoire&#x27;s top musical honour, the Prix de Rome, previous winners of which included Berlioz, Thomas, Gounod and Bizet. The first two of these were on the judging panel for the 1863 competition. All the competitors had to set the same text by Gustave Chouquet, a cantata about David Rizzio; after all the settings had been performed Massenet came face to face with the judges. He recalled:

The prize brought a well-subsidised three-year period of study, two-thirds of which was spent at the French Academy in Rome, based at the Villa Medici. At that time the academy was dominated by painters rather than musicians; Massenet enjoyed his time there, and made lifelong friendships with, among others, the sculptor Alexandre Falguière and the painter Carolus-Duran, but the musical benefit he derived was largely self-taught. He absorbed the music at St Peter&#x27;s, and closely studied the works of the great German masters, from Handel and Bach to contemporary composers. During his time in Rome, Massenet met Franz Liszt, at whose request he gave piano lessons to Louise-Constance &quot;Ninon&quot; de Gressy, the daughter of one of Liszt&#x27;s rich patrons. Massenet and Ninon fell in love, but marriage was out of the question while he was a student with modest means.

===Early works===
Massenet returned to Paris in 1866. He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the Opéra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas&#x27;s instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act opéra comique, &quot;La grand&#x27;tante&quot;, presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann&#x27;s journalistic contacts did much to promote his protégé&#x27;s reputation.

In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet&#x27;s musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so &quot;utterly terrible&quot; that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the siege of Paris but managed to get out before the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.

After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an opéra comique in four acts, &quot;Don César de Bazan&quot; (Paris, 1872). It was a failure, but in 1873 he succeeded with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Les Érinnyes&quot; and with the dramatic oratorio, &quot;Marie-Magdeleine&quot;, both of which were performed at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon. His reputation as a composer was growing, but at this stage he earned most of his income from teaching, giving lessons for six hours a day.

Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o&#x27;clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot;, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, was a success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper in Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, &quot;The Times&quot; summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer&#x27;s operas: &quot;M. Massenet&#x27;s opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.&quot;

This period was an early high point in Massenet&#x27;s career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: &quot;My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice&quot;. Saint-Saëns cabled back, &quot;I quite agree.&quot; He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.

Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire. His pupils included Bruneau, Charpentier, Chausson, Hahn, Leroux, Pierné, Rabaud and Vidal. He was known for the care he took in drawing out his pupils&#x27; ideas, never trying to impose his own. One of his last students, Charles Koechlin, recalled Massenet as a voluble professor, dispensing &quot;a teaching active, living, vibrant, and moreover comprehensive&quot;. According to some writers, Massenet&#x27;s influence extended beyond his own students. In the view of the critic Rodney Milnes, &quot;In word-setting alone, all French musicians profited from the freedom he won from earlier restrictions.&quot; Romain Rolland and Francis Poulenc have both considered Massenet an influence on Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;; Debussy was a student at the Conservatoire during Massenet&#x27;s professorship but did not study under him.

===Operatic successes and failures, 1879–96===
Massenet&#x27;s growing reputation did not prevent a contretemps with the Paris Opéra in 1879. Auguste Vaucorbeil, director of the Opéra, refused to stage the composer&#x27;s new piece, &quot;Hérodiade&quot;, judging the libretto either improper or inadequate. Édouard-Fortuné Calabresi, joint director of the Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels, immediately offered to present the work, and its première, lavishly staged, was given in December 1881. It ran for fifty-five performances in Brussels, and had its Italian premiere two months later at La Scala. The work finally reached Paris in February 1884, by which time Massenet had established himself as the leading French opera composer of his generation.
&quot;Manon&quot;, first given at the Opéra-Comique in January 1884, was a prodigious success and was followed by productions at major opera houses in Europe and the United States. Together with Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; it became, and has remained, one of the cornerstones of the French operatic repertoire. After the intimate drama of &quot;Manon&quot;, Massenet once more turned to opera on the grand scale with &quot;Le Cid&quot; in 1885, which marked his return to the Opéra. The Paris correspondent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that with this new work Massenet &quot;has resolutely declared himself a melodist of undoubted consistency and of remarkable inspiration.&quot; After these two triumphs, Massenet entered a period of mixed fortunes. He worked on &quot;Werther&quot; intermittently for several years, but it was rejected by the Opéra-Comique as too gloomy. In 1887 he met the American soprano Sibyl Sanderson. He developed passionate feelings for her, which remained platonic, although it was widely believed in Paris that she was his mistress, as caricatures in the journals hinted with varying degrees of subtlety. For her, the composer revised &quot;Manon&quot; and wrote &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; (1889). The latter was a success, but it was followed by &quot;Le mage&quot; (1891), which failed. Massenet did not complete his next project, &quot;Amadis&quot;, and it was not until 1892 that he recovered his earlier successful form. &quot;Werther&quot; received its first performance in February 1892, when the Vienna Hofoper asked for a new piece, following the enthusiastic reception of the Austrian premiere of &quot;Manon&quot;.

Though in the view of some writers &quot;Werther&quot; is the composer&#x27;s masterpiece, it was not immediately taken up with the same keenness as &quot;Manon&quot;. The first performance in Paris was in January 1893 by the Opéra-Comique company at the Théâtre Lyrique, and there were performances in the United States, Italy and Britain, but it met with a muted response. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of it, &quot;If M. Massenet&#x27;s opera does not have lasting success it will be because it has no genuine depth. Perhaps M. Massenet is not capable of achieving profound depths of tragic passion; but certainly he will never do so in a work like &quot;Werther&quot;&quot;. It was not until a revival by the Opéra-Comique in 1903 that the work became an established favourite.

&quot;Thaïs&quot; (1894), composed for Sanderson, was moderately received. Like &quot;Werther&quot;, it did not gain widespread popularity among French opera-goers until its first revival, which was four years after the premiere, by which time the composer&#x27;s association with Sanderson was over. In the same year he had a modest success in Paris with the one-act &quot;Le portrait de Manon&quot; at the Opéra-Comique, and a much greater one in London with &quot;La Navarraise&quot; at Covent Garden. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that in this piece Massenet had adopted the &quot;verismo&quot; style of such works as Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; to great effect. The audience clamoured for the composer to acknowledge the applause, but Massenet, always a shy man, declined to take even a single curtain call.

===Later years, 1896–1912===
The death of Ambroise Thomas in February 1896 made vacant the post of director of the Conservatoire. The French government announced on 6 May that Massenet had been offered the position and had refused it. The following day it was announced that another faculty member, Théodore Dubois, had been appointed director, and Massenet had resigned as professor of composition. Two explanations have been advanced for this sequence of events. Massenet wrote in 1910 that he had remained in his post as professor out of loyalty to Thomas, and was eager to abandon all academic work in favour of composing, a statement repeated by his biographers Hugh Macdonald and Demar Irvine. Other writers on French music have written that Massenet was intensely ambitious to succeed Thomas, but resigned in pique after three months of manoeuvring, once the authorities finally rejected his insistence on being appointed director for life, as Thomas had been. He was succeeded as professor by Gabriel Fauré, who was doubtful of Massenet&#x27;s credentials, considering his popular style to be &quot;based on a generally cynical view of art&quot;.
With &quot;Grisélidis&quot; and &quot;Cendrillon&quot; complete, though still awaiting performance, Massenet began work on &quot;Sapho&quot;, based on a novel by Daudet about the love of an innocent young man from the country for a worldly-wise Parisienne. It was given at the Opéra-Comique in November 1897, with great success, though it has been neglected since the composer&#x27;s death. His next work staged there was &quot;Cendrillon&quot;, his version of the Cinderella story, which was well received in May 1899.

Macdonald comments that at the start of the 20th century Massenet was in the enviable position of having his works included in every season of the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, and in opera houses around the world. From 1900 to his death he led a life of steady work and, generally, success. According to his memoirs, he declined a second offer of the directorship of the Conservatoire in 1905. Apart from composition, his main concern was his home life in the rue de Vaugirard, Paris, and at his country house in Égreville. He was uninterested in Parisian society, and so shunned the limelight that in later life he preferred not to attend his own first nights. He described himself as &quot;a fireside man, a bourgeois artist&quot;. The main biographical detail of note of his latter years was his second &quot;amitié amoureuse&quot; with one of his leading ladies, Lucy Arbell, who created roles in his last operas. Milnes describes Arbell as &quot;gold-digging&quot;: her blatant exploitation of the composer&#x27;s honourable affections caused his wife considerable distress and even strained Massenet&#x27;s devotion (or infatuation as Milnes characterises it). After the composer&#x27;s death Arbell pursued his widow and publishers through the law courts, seeking to secure herself a monopoly of the leading roles in several of his late operas.

A rare excursion from the opera house came in 1903 with Massenet&#x27;s only piano concerto, on which he had begun work while still a student. The work was performed by Louis Diémer at the Conservatoire, but made little impression compared with his operas. In 1905 Massenet composed &quot;Chérubin&quot;, a light comedy about the later career of the sex-mad pageboy Cherubino from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. Then came two serious operas, &quot;Ariane&quot;, on the Greek legend of Theseus and Ariadne, and &quot;Thérèse&quot;, a terse drama set in the French Revolution. His last major success was &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; (1910), which &quot;L&#x27;Etoile&quot; called &quot;a very Parisian evening and, naturally, a very Parisian triumph&quot;. Even with his creative powers seemingly in decline he wrote four other operas in his later years – &quot;Bacchus&quot;, &quot;Roma&quot;, &quot;Panurge&quot; and &quot;Cléopâtre&quot;. The last two, like &quot;Amadis&quot;, which he had been unable to finish in the 1890s, were premiered after the composer&#x27;s death and then lapsed into oblivion.

In August 1912 Massenet went to Paris from his house at Égreville to see his doctor. The composer had been suffering from abdominal cancer for some months, but his symptoms did not seem imminently life-threatening. Within a few days his condition deteriorated sharply. His wife and family hastened to Paris, and were with him when he died, aged seventy. By his own wish his funeral, with no music, was held privately at Égreville, where he is buried in the churchyard.

==Music==
===Background===
In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet&#x27;s main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner&#x27;s spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.

Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him &quot;one of the loudest of modern composers&quot; – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side &quot;is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in &quot;Werther&quot;), theatrical action (as in &quot;Thérèse&quot;), scenic diversion (as in &quot;Esclarmonde&quot;), or humour (as in &quot;Le portrait de Manon&quot;).&quot;

Massenet&#x27;s Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet&#x27;s practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices.

===Operas===
Massenet wrote more than thirty operas. Authorities differ on the exact total because some of the works, particularly from his early years, are lost and others were left incomplete. Still others, such as &quot;Don César de Bazan&quot; and &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot;, were substantially recomposed after their first productions and exist in two or more versions. &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; lists forty Massenet operas in all, of which nine are shown as lost or destroyed. The &quot;OperaGlass&quot; website of Stanford University shows revised versions as premieres, and &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot; does not: their totals are forty-four and thirty-six respectively.

Having honed his personal style as a young man, and sticking broadly with it for the rest of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: &quot;Grove&quot; lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.

The 1954 (fifth) edition of &quot;Grove&quot; said of Massenet, &quot;to have heard &quot;Manon&quot; is to have heard the whole of him&quot;. In 1994 Andrew Porter called this view preposterous. He countered, &quot;Who knows &quot;Manon&quot;, &quot;Werther&quot; and &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; knows the best of Massenet, but not his range from heroic romance to steamy verismo.&quot; Massenet&#x27;s output covered most of the different subgenres of opera, from opérette (&quot;L&#x27;adorable Bel&#x27;-Boul&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;écureuil du déshonneur&quot; – both early pieces, the latter lost) and opéra-comique such as &quot;Manon&quot;, to grand opera – &quot;Grove&quot; categorises &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot; as &quot;the last grand opera to have a great and widespread success&quot;. Many of the elements of traditional grand opera are written into later large-scale works such as &quot;Le mage&quot; and &quot;Hérodiade&quot;. Massenet&#x27;s operas consist of anything from one to five acts, and although many of them are described on the title pages of their scores as &quot;opéra&quot; or &quot;opéra comique&quot;, others have carefully nuanced descriptions such as &quot;comédie chantée&quot;, &quot;comédie lyrique&quot;, &quot;comédie-héroïque&quot;, &quot;conte de fées&quot;, &quot;drame passionnel&quot;, &quot;haulte farce musicale&quot;, &quot;opéra légendaire&quot;, &quot;opéra romanesque&quot; and &quot;opéra tragique&quot;.

In some of his operas, such as &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; and &quot;Le mage&quot;, Massenet moved away from the traditional French pattern of free-standing arias and duets. Solos meld from declamatory passages into more melodic form, in a way that many contemporary critics thought Wagnerian. Shaw was not among them: in 1885 he wrote of &quot;Manon&quot;:

The 21st-century critic Anne Feeney comments, &quot;Massenet rarely repeated musical phrases, let alone used recurrent themes, so the resemblance [to Wagner] lies solely in the declamatory lyricism and enthusiastic use of the brass and percussion.&quot; Massenet enjoyed introducing comedy into his serious works, and writing some mainly comic operas. In Macdonald&#x27;s view of the comic works, &quot;Cendrillon&quot; and &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; succeed, but &quot;Don César de Bazan&quot; and &quot;Panurge&quot; are less satisfying than &quot;the more delicately tuned operas such as &quot;Manon&quot;, &quot;Le portrait de Manon&quot; and &quot;Le jongleur de Notre-Dame&quot;, where comedy serves a more complex purpose.&quot;

According to Operabase, analysis of productions around the world in 2012–13 shows Massenet as the twentieth most popular of all opera composers, and the fourth most popular French one, after Bizet, Offenbach and Gounod. The most often performed of his operas in the period are shown as &quot;Werther&quot; (63 productions in all countries), followed by &quot;Manon&quot; (47), &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; (22), &quot;Thaïs&quot; (21), &quot;Cendrillon&quot; (17), &quot;La Navarraise&quot; (4), &quot;Cléopâtre&quot; (3), &quot;Thérèse&quot; (2), &quot;Le Cid&quot; (2), &quot;Hérodiade&quot; (2), &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; (2), &quot;Chérubin&quot; (2) and &quot;Le mage&quot; (1).

===Other vocal music===
Between 1862 and 1900 Massenet composed eight oratorios and cantatas, mostly on religious subjects. There is a degree of overlap between his operatic style and his choral works for church or concert hall performance. Vincent d&#x27;Indy wrote that there was &quot;a discreet and semi-religious eroticism&quot; in Massenet&#x27;s music. The religious element was a regular theme in his secular as well as sacred works: this derived not from any strong personal faith, but from his response to the dramatic aspects of Roman Catholic ritual. The mingling of operatic and religious elements in his works was such that one of his oratorios, &quot;Marie-Magdeleine&quot;, was staged as an opera during the composer&#x27;s lifetime. Elements of the erotic and some implicit sympathy for sinners were controversial, and may have prevented his church works establishing themselves more securely. Arthur Hervey, a contemporary critic not unsympathetic to Massenet, commented that &quot;Marie-Magdeleine&quot; and the later oratorio &quot;Ève&quot; (1875) were &quot;the Bible doctored up in a manner suitable to the taste of impressionable Parisian ladies – utterly inadequate for the theme, at the same time very charming and effective.&quot; Of the four works categorised by Irvine and &quot;Grove&quot; as oratorios, only one, &quot;La terre promise&quot; (1900), was written for church performance. Massenet used the term &quot;oratorio&quot; for that work, but he called &quot;Marie-Magdeleine&quot; a &quot;&quot;drame sacré&quot;, &quot;Ève&quot; a &quot;mystère&quot;, and &quot;La Vierge&quot; (1880) a &quot;légende sacrée&quot;&quot;.

Massenet composed many other smaller-scale choral works, and more than two hundred songs. His early collections of songs were particularly popular and helped establish his reputation. His choice of lyrics ranged widely. Most were verses by poets such as Musset, Maupassant, Hugo, Gautier and many lesser-known French writers, with occasional poems from overseas, including Tennyson in English and Shelley in French translation. &quot;Grove&quot; comments that Massenet&#x27;s songs, though pleasing and impeccable in craftsmanship, are less inventive than those of Bizet and less distinctive than those of Duparc and Fauré.

===Orchestral and chamber music===
Massenet was a fluent and skilful orchestrator, and willingly provided ballet episodes for his operas, incidental music for plays, and a one-act stand-alone ballet for Vienna (&quot;Le carillon&quot;, 1892). Macdonald remarks that Massenet&#x27;s orchestral style resembled that of Delibes, &quot;with its graceful movement and bewitching colour&quot;, which was highly suited to classical French ballet. The &quot;Méditation&quot; for solo violin and orchestra, from &quot;Thaïs&quot;, is possibly the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet, and appears on many recordings. Another popular stand-alone orchestral piece from the operas is &quot;Le dernier sommeil de la Vierge&quot; from &quot;La Vierge&quot;, which has featured on numerous discs since the middle of the 20th century.

A Parisian critic, after seeing &quot;La grand&#x27; tante&quot;, declared that Massenet was a symphonist rather than a theatre composer. At the time of the British premiere of &quot;Manon&quot; in 1885, the critic in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French &quot;confrère&#x27;s&quot; view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral. Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, &quot;What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise I would not be myself.&quot; His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to &quot;Grove&quot;, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire. Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, &quot;Visions&quot; (1891), an &quot;Ouverture de Concert&quot; (1863) and &quot;Ouverture de Phèdre&quot; (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive.

===Recordings===
The only known recording made by Massenet is an excerpt from &quot;Sapho&quot;, &quot;Pendant un an je fus ta femme&quot;, in which he plays a piano accompaniment for the soprano Georgette Leblanc. It was recorded in 1903, and was not intended for publication. It has been released on compact disc (2008), together with contemporary recordings by Grieg, Saint-Saëns, Debussy and others.

In Massenet&#x27;s later years, and in the decade after his death, many of his songs and opera extracts were recorded. Some of the performers were the original creators of the roles, such as Ernest van Dyck (&quot;Werther&quot;), Emma Calvé (&quot;Sapho&quot;), Hector Dufranne (&quot;Grisélidis&quot;), and Vanni Marcoux (&quot;Panurge&quot;). Complete French recordings of &quot;Manon&quot; and &quot;Werther&quot;, conducted by Élie Cohen, were issued in 1932 and 1933 and have been republished on CD. The critic Alan Blyth comments that they embody the original, intimate Opéra-Comique style of performing Massenet.

Of Massenet&#x27;s operas, the two best known, &quot;Manon&quot; and &quot;Werther&quot;, have been recorded many times, and studio or live recordings have been issued of many of the others, including &quot;Cendrillon&quot;, &quot;Le Cid&quot;, &quot;Don Quichotte&quot;, &quot;Esclarmonde&quot;, &quot;Hérodiade&quot;, &quot;Le jongleur de Notre-Dame&quot;, &quot;Le mage&quot;, &quot;La Navarraise&quot; and &quot;Thaïs&quot;. Conductors on these discs include Sir Thomas Beecham, Richard Bonynge, Riccardo Chailly, Sir Colin Davis, Patrick Fournillier, Sir Charles Mackerras, Pierre Monteux, Sir Antonio Pappano and Michel Plasson. Among the sopranos and mezzos are Dame Janet Baker, Victoria de los Ángeles, Natalie Dessay, Renée Fleming, Angela Gheorghiu and Dame Joan Sutherland. Leading men in recordings of Massenet operas include Roberto Alagna, Gabriel Bacquier, Plácido Domingo, Thomas Hampson, Jonas Kaufmann, José van Dam, Alain Vanzo, Tito Schipa and Rolando Villazón.

In addition to the operas, recordings have been issued of several orchestral works, including the ballet &quot;Le carillon&quot;, the piano concerto in E, the &quot;Fantaisie&quot; for cello and orchestra, and orchestral suites. Many individual &quot;mélodies&quot; by Massenet were included in mixed recitals on record during the 20th century, and more have been committed to disc since then, including, for the first time, a CD in 2012, exclusively devoted to his songs for soprano and piano.

==Reputation==
By the time of the composer&#x27;s death in 1912 his reputation had declined, especially outside his native country. In the second edition (1907) of &quot;Grove&quot;, J A Fuller Maitland accused the composer of pandering to the fashionable Parisian taste of the moment, and disguising a uniformly &quot;weak and sugary&quot; style with superficial effects. Fuller Maitland contended that to discerning music lovers such as himself the operas of Massenet were &quot;inexpressibly monotonous&quot;, and he predicted that they would all be forgotten after the composer&#x27;s death. Similar views were expressed in an obituary in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;:

Massenet was never entirely without supporters. In the 1930s Sir Thomas Beecham told the critic Neville Cardus, &quot;I would give the whole of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot; for Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;, and would think I had vastly profited by the exchange.&quot; By the 1950s critics were reappraising Massenet&#x27;s works. In 1951 Martin Cooper of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that Massenet&#x27;s detractors, including some fellow composers, were on the whole idealistic, even puritanical, &quot;but few of them have in practice achieved anything so near perfection in any genre, however humble, as Massenet achieved in his best works.&quot; In 1955 Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor commented in &quot;The Record Guide&quot; that, although usually dismissed as an inferior Gounod, Massenet wrote music with a distinct flavour of its own. &quot;He had a gift for melody of a suave, voluptuous and eminently singable kind, and the intelligence and dramatic sense to make the most of it.&quot; The writers called for revivals of &quot;Grisélidis&quot;, &quot;Le jongleur de Notre-Dame&quot;, &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; and &quot;Cendrillon&quot;, all then neglected. By the 1990s, Massenet&#x27;s reputation had been considerably rehabilitated. In &quot;The Penguin Opera Guide&quot; (1993), Hugh Macdonald wrote that though Massenet&#x27;s operas never equalled the grandeur of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, the genius of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; or the profundity of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, from the 1860s until the years before the First World War, the composer gave the French lyric stage a remarkable series of works, two of which – &quot;Manon&quot; and &quot;Werther&quot; – are &quot;masterpieces that will always grace the repertoire&quot;. In Macdonald&#x27;s view, Massenet &quot;embodies many enduring aspects of the belle époque, one of the richest cultural periods in history&quot;. In France, Massenet&#x27;s 20th-century eclipse was less complete than elsewhere, but his &quot;oeuvre&quot; has been revalued in recent years. In 2003 Piotr Kaminsky wrote in &quot;Mille et un opéras&quot; of Massenet&#x27;s skill in translating French text into flexible melodic phrases, his exceptional orchestral virtuosity, combining sparkle and clarity, and his unerring theatrical instinct. Begun by Jean-Louis Pichon in November 1990, the Massenet Festival in Massenet&#x27;s native Saint-Étienne have produced biennial performances to promote and celebrate his music.

Rodney Milnes, in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot; (1992), agrees that &quot;Manon&quot; and &quot;Werther&quot; have a secure place in the international repertoire; he counts three others as &quot;re-establishing a toehold&quot; (&quot;Cendrillon&quot;, &quot;Thaïs&quot; and &quot;Don Quichotte&quot;), with many more due for re-evaluation or rediscovery. He concludes that comparing Massenet with the handful of composers of great genius, &quot;It would be absurd to claim that he was anything more than a second-rate composer; he nevertheless deserves to be seen, like Richard Strauss, at least as a first-class second-rate one.&quot;

<text>Bulawayo (, ; ) is the second largest city in Zimbabwe, and the largest city in the country&#x27;s Matabeleland region. The city&#x27;s population is disputed; the 2022 census listed it at 665,940, while the Bulawayo City Council claimed it to be about 1.2 million. Bulawayo covers an area of in the western part of the country, along the Matsheumhlope River. Along with the capital Harare, Bulawayo is one of two cities in Zimbabwe that are also provinces.

Bulawayo was founded by a group led by Gundwane Ndiweni around 1840 as the kraal of Mzilikazi, the Ndebele king and was known as Gibixhegu. His son, Lobengula, succeeded him in the 1860s, and changed the name to koBulawayo and ruled from Bulawayo until 1893, when the settlement was captured by British South Africa Company soldiers during the First Matabele War. That year, the first white settlers arrived and rebuilt the town. The town was besieged by Ndebele warriors during the Second Matabele War. Bulawayo attained municipality status in 1897, and city status in 1943.

Historically, Bulawayo has been the principal industrial centre of Zimbabwe; its factories produce cars and car products, building materials, electronic products, textiles, furniture, and food products. Bulawayo is also the hub of Zimbabwe&#x27;s rail network and the headquarters of the National Railways of Zimbabwe.

Bulawayo&#x27;s central business district (CBD) covers in the heart of the city and is surrounded by numerous suburbs. The majority of the city&#x27;s population belongs to the Ndebele people, with minorities of Shona and other groups. Bulawayo is home to over a dozen colleges and universities, most notably the National University of Science and Technology, Bulawayo Polytechnic College, Zimbabwe School of Mines, Hillside Teachers College, and the United College of Education. The Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe, formerly the National Museum, is located in Bulawayo. The city is close to tourist sites such as Matobo National Park and the Khami World Heritage Site.

==History==

The city was founded by the Ndebele king Lobengula, the son of King Mzilikazi, born of Matshobana, who settled in modern-day Zimbabwe around the 1840s. This followed the Ndebele people&#x27;s great trek from northern Kwazulu. The name &quot;Bulawayo&quot; comes from the Ndebele word &quot;bulala&quot; and it translates to &quot;the one to be killed&quot;. It is thought that at the time of the formation of the city there was a civil war. Mbiko ka Madlenya Masuku, a trusted confidant of King Mzilikazi and leader of the Zwangendaba regiment, fought Prince Lobhengula as he did not believe that he was the legitimate heir to the throne. This was because Lobhengula was born to a Swazi mother, and Masuku felt that she was of a lesser class.

At the time Lobengula was a prince fighting to ascend his father&#x27;s throne. It was common at the time for people to refer to Bulawayo as &quot;Bulawayo UmntwaneNkosi&quot;, &quot;a place where they are fighting or rising against the prince&quot;. The city of Bulawayo coincidentally has a similar name to the capital of the great Zulu warrior king Shaka ka Senzangakhona in Kwazulu, where Mzilikazi and his Khumalo clan and other Nguni people came from.

In the 1860s, the city was influenced by European intrigue. Many colonial powers cast covetous eyes on Bulawayo and the land surrounding it because of its strategic location. Britain made skilful use of private initiative in the shape of Cecil Rhodes and the Chartered Company to disarm the suspicion of her rivals. Lobengula once described Britain as a chameleon and himself as the fly.

During the 1893 First Matabele War, British South Africa Company (BSAC) troops invaded and forced King Lobengula to evacuate his followers, after first detonating munitions and setting fire to the town. BSAC troops and white settlers occupied the ruins. On 4 November 1893, Leander Starr Jameson declared Bulawayo a settlement under the rule of the BSAC. Cecil Rhodes ordered the new settlement to be founded on the ruins of Lobengula&#x27;s royal kraal, a typical action by a conquering power. This is where the State House stands today.

In 1897, the new town of Bulawayo acquired the status of municipality in the British colonial system, and Lt. Col. Harry White was appointed as one of the first mayors.

===Siege===
At the outbreak of the Second Matabele War, in March 1896, Bulawayo was besieged by Ndebele forces. The settlers established a laager here for defensive purposes. The Ndebele had experienced the brutal effectiveness of the Maxim guns employed by BSAC troops in the First Matabele War, so they never mounted a significant attack against Bulawayo, although over 10,000 Ndebele warriors gathered to surround the town. Rather than wait passively for attack, the settlers mounted patrols, called the Bulawayo Field Force, under Frederick Selous and Frederick Russell Burnham. These patrols rode out to rescue any surviving settlers in the countryside and attacked the Ndebele. In the first week of fighting, 20 men of the Bulawayo Field Force were killed and 50 were wounded. An unknown number of Ndebele were killed and wounded.

During the siege, conditions in Bulawayo quickly deteriorated. By day, settlers could go to homes and buildings in the town, but at night they were forced to seek shelter in the much smaller laager. Nearly 1,000 women and children were crowded into the small area and false alarms of attacks were common. The Ndebele neglected to cut the telegraph lines connecting Bulawayo to Mafikeng. The settlers and forces appealed for relief, and the BSAC sent additional troops from Salisbury and Fort Victoria (now Harare and Masvingo respectively) to the north, and from Kimberley and Mafeking to the south. Once the relief forces arrived in late May 1896, the siege was broken. An estimated 50,000 Ndebele retreated into their stronghold of the Matobo Hills near Bulawayo. Not until October 1896 did the Ndebele finally surrender their arms to the invaders.
===Modern era===
By the late 1930s, Bulawayo was no longer the country&#x27;s biggest city. Influence and activity moved eastwards to the other cities, especially Salisbury, a trend which continues up to the present day. Despite this, after the Second World War, prosperity and population growth revived, as the city became an industrial powerhouse, peaking during the Federal years as new markets opened in Malawi and Zambia. However, Bulawayo trailed the development of other cities notably, Johannesburg, Harare and Cape Town during the same period. In 1943, Bulawayo received city status.


By 1992, population decline and slow growth were beginning to occur which disproportionately affected heavy industry. In response, Bulawayo sought to re-invent itself as a &#x27;heritage city&#x27;, with its wide main streets refurbished and its Victorian architecture and industrial heritage preserved. Institutions such as the Bulawayo Railway Museum and Nesbitt Castle were restored. The city was also recognised as a centre of excellence in tertiary education and research, as the National University of Science and Technology, Zimbabwe was formed and expanded and other colleges growth also accelerated.

Since the late 20th century, Bulawayo has suffered a sharp fall in living standards coinciding with the protracted economic crisis affecting the country. The main challenges the city faces include underinvestment, declining infrastructure, de-industrialisation and the effects of corruption and nepotism. Much of the city&#x27;s educated workers have migrated south to neighbouring South Africa or further afield to the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Public service concerns have become steadily more acute, with particular concern in the health sector from a growing shortage of experienced doctors and nurses. As a result, the city faced an avoidable cholera outbreak in 2008. Though the city is the centre of the southern population generally categorized as the Matebele, the population includes various ethnicities, as well as a small number of expats, mostly from neighbouring countries.

The Central Business District has the widest roads. These were designed to accommodate the ox-drawn carts, and to allow them to make a turn in the street, that were used as a primary means of transport when the town was planned and erected.

Bulawayo is nicknamed the &quot;City of Kings&quot; or &quot;kontuthu ziyathunqa&quot;—a Ndebele phrase for &quot;smoke arising&quot;. This name arose from the city&#x27;s historically large industrial base. The large cooling towers of the coal-powered electricity generating plant situated in the city centre once used to exhaust steam and smoke over the city.

==Demographics==

===Population census controversy===
The population of Bulawayo, according to the 2012 national census, stood at 653,337; however, this figure has been rejected by the Bulawayo City Council authority with Councillor Martin Moyo claiming an anti-Bulawayo conspiracy to under-fund projects in the city.

===Ethnic groups===

The vast majority of Bulawayo City residents were Black African with 97.96%. Other ethnic groups in the city were Coloured (0.9%), White (0.75%), Asian (0.22%). Members of other ethnic groups comprised 0.02%, and 0.14% of the city did not state their ethnic group. There were 4,926 White Zimbabweans living in Bulawayo in 2012.

==Economy==
Bulawayo was known as the industrial hub of Zimbabwe, leading to the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair being hosted in Bulawayo. It had a large manufacturing presence with large industries based here before Zimbabwe&#x27;s economic decline. However, some of these companies have either moved operations to Harare or have closed down – which has crippled Bulawayo&#x27;s economy. Most factories are deserted and the infrastructure has since been left to deteriorate. The reason for the de-industrialization has largely been political, with some factories like Goldstar Sugars removing machinery to open new factories in Harare. When the Zimbabwean government passed indigenisation laws, some successful businesses were taken over by ZANU–PF supporters, only to close down a few years later.

Many locals argue that it is because of marginalisation they experience against the government due to political tensions with the ZANU PF government in Harare and the MDC run Bulawayo council, for instance, the National railways of Zimbabwe (headquarters in Bulawayo) is a government owned entity and, as such, should have been thriving had it not been for embezzlement of funds by company executives who are believed to be Shona. The water issue is not new and had brought about the &quot;help a thirsty Matabele&quot; initiative of the 1970s and the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project which would put an end to the water issue in Matabeleland was drafted; however, this project was put on hold soon after independence.

These allegations have all been refuted by national authorities. The city still contains the bulk of Zimbabwe&#x27;s heavy industry and food processing capability.

Like many parts of the country, Bulawayo has for the past ten years seen a huge drop in service delivery and an increase in unemployment, with many who can opting to seek better prospects abroad. Many people resorted to farming, mining, and the black market for sustenance, while others depended on the little foreign currency that would be sent by family in other countries. However, with inauguration of the Mnangagwa government, a new approach is seen by investors in the city who admire the already-available infrastructure; the huge workforce; and Bulawayo as a potential business hub. It is set to once again contribute greatly to the economy of Zimbabwe.

==Geography==
Bulawayo is located in the south west of Zimbabwe. It is in the middle of the savanna country. It has four seasons, with rains starting in late October to about March. Coldest months being May and June with July being cold and windy.

===Topography===
The city sits on a plain that marks the Highveld of Zimbabwe and is close to the watershed between the Zambezi and Limpopo drainage basins. The land slopes gently downwards to the north and northwest. The southern side is hillier, and the land becomes more broken in the direction of the Matobo Hills to the south.
===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Bulawayo features a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;). Due to its relatively high altitude, the city has fairly moderate temperatures despite lying in the tropics. The mean annual temperature is , similar to Pretoria at a similar altitude but almost further south. As with much of southern and eastern Zimbabwe, Bulawayo is cooled by a prevailing southeasterly airflow most of the year and experiences three broad seasons: a dry, cool winter season from May to August; a hot dry period in early summer from late August to early November; and a warm wet period in the rest of the summer, early November to April.

The hottest month is October, which is usually the height of the dry season. The average maximum temperature ranges from in July to in October. During the rainy season, daytime maxima are around . Nights are always cool, ranging from in July to in January.

The city&#x27;s average annual rainfall is , which supports a natural vegetation of open woodland, dominated by &quot;Combretum&quot; and &quot;Terminalia&quot; trees. Most rain falls in the December to February period, while June to August is usually rainless. Being close to the Kalahari Desert, Bulawayo is vulnerable to droughts and rainfall tends to vary sharply from one year to another. In 1978, of rain fell in the three months up to February (February 1944 is the wettest month on record with ) while in the three months ending in February 1983, only fell.

=== Water supply ===
Bulawayo has good-quality tap water owing to the management of the water authorities, meeting international standards. Bulawayo does not recycle waste water but uses treated waste water for irrigation.

Bulawayo experiences water shortages in drought seasons due to the overwhelming increase in population versus the static and sometimes decreasing capacity of the reserve dams. The geographical factors causing water scarcity are rising temperatures, the area&#x27;s high elevation and the arid environment of Matabeleland.

Environmental and sanitation circumstances have detrimental effects on water quality. Sources such as groundwater and tap water are subject to pollution due to waste from burst sewers contaminating them. Samples taken from well water from the Pumula and Robert Sinyoka suburbs show that well water maintain levels of coliform higher than the Standards Association of Zimbabwe and World Health Organization give.

==Sports==
Bulawayo is home to the Queens Sports Club and Bulawayo Athletic Club, two of the three grounds in Zimbabwe where test match cricket has been played.

Bulawayo Golf Club, the first golf club in the city and country, was established in 1895. The Matsheumhlope Stream cuts through the 18 hole course in the suburbs.

It is home to Hartsfield Rugby grounds where many international Test matches have been played. Hartsfield was developed by Reg Hart, after whom the grounds were named and on which field many of southern Africa&#x27;s greatest rugby players have competed. It is home to two large football teams: Highlanders and Zimbabwe Saints. Other football teams include Bantu Rovers, Chicken Inn, How Mine, Quelaton, and Bulawayo City (R).

<text>A cognitive model is a representation of one or more cognitive processes in humans or other animals for the purposes of comprehension and prediction. There are many types of cognitive models, and they can range from box-and-arrow diagrams to a set of equations to software programs that interact with the same tools that humans use to complete tasks (e.g., computer mouse and keyboard). In terms of information processing, cognitive modeling is modeling of human perception, reasoning, memory and action.

==Relationship to cognitive architectures==
Cognitive models can be developed within or without a cognitive architecture, though the two are not always easily distinguishable. In contrast to cognitive architectures, cognitive models tend to be focused on a single cognitive phenomenon or process (e.g., list learning), how two or more processes interact (e.g., visual search bsc1780 decision making), or making behavioral predictions for a specific task or tool (e.g., how instituting a new software package will affect productivity). Cognitive architectures tend to be focused on the structural properties of the modeled system, and help constrain the development of cognitive models within the architecture. Likewise, model development helps to inform limitations and shortcomings of the architecture. Some of the most popular architectures for cognitive modeling include ACT-R, Clarion, LIDA, and Soar.

==History==
Cognitive modeling historically developed within cognitive psychology/cognitive science (including human factors), and has received contributions from the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence among others.

==Box-and-arrow models==
A number of key terms are used to describe the processes involved in the perception, storage, and production of speech. Typically, they are used by speech pathologists while treating a child patient. The input signal is the speech signal heard by the child, usually assumed to come from an adult speaker. The output signal is the utterance produced by the child. The unseen psychological events that occur between the arrival of an input signal and the production of speech are the focus of psycholinguistic models. Events that process the input signal are referred to as input processes, whereas events that process the production of speech are referred to as output processes. Some aspects of speech processing are thought to happen online—that is, they occur during the actual perception
or production of speech and thus require a share of the attentional resources dedicated to the speech task. Other processes, thought to happen offline, take place as part of the child&#x27;s background mental processing rather than during the time dedicated to the speech task.
In this sense, online processing is sometimes defined as occurring in real-time, whereas offline processing is said to be time-free (Hewlett, 1990). In box-and-arrow psycholinguistic models, each hypothesized level of representation or processing can be represented in a diagram by a “box,” and the relationships between them by “arrows,” hence the name. Sometimes (as in the models of Smith, 1973, and Menn, 1978, described later in this paper) the arrows represent processes additional to those shown in boxes. Such models make explicit the hypothesized information-
processing activities carried out in a particular cognitive function (such as language), in a manner analogous to computer flowcharts that depict the processes and decisions carried out by a computer program. Box-and-arrow models differ widely in the number of unseen psychological processes they describe and thus in the number of boxes they contain. Some have only one or two boxes between the input and output signals (e.g., Menn, 1978; Smith, 1973), whereas others have multiple boxes representing complex relationships between a number of different information-processing events (e.g., Hewlett, 1990; Hewlett, Gibbon, &amp; Cohen- McKenzie, 1998; Stackhouse &amp; Wells, 1997). The most important box, however, and the source of much ongoing debate, is that representing the underlying representation (or UR). In essence, an underlying representation captures information stored in a child&#x27;s mind about a word he or she knows and uses. As the following description of several models will illustrate, the nature of this information and thus the type(s) of representation present in the child&#x27;s knowledge base have captured the attention of researchers for some time. (Elise Baker et al. Psycholinguistic Models of Speech Development and Their Application to Clinical Practice. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research. June 2001. 44. p 685–702.)

==Computational models==

A computational model is a mathematical model in computational science that requires extensive computational resources to study the behavior of a complex system by computer simulation. The system under study is often a complex nonlinear system for which simple, intuitive analytical solutions are not readily available. Rather than deriving a mathematical analytical solution to the problem, experimentation with the model is done by changing the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments. Theories of operation of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments.
Examples of common computational models are weather forecasting models, earth simulator models, flight simulator models, molecular protein folding models, and neural network models.

===Symbolic===
A &quot;symbolic&quot; model is expressed in characters, usually non-numeric ones, that require translation before they can be used.

===Subsymbolic===
A cognitive model is &quot;subsymbolic&quot; if it is made by constituent entities that are not representations in their turn, e.g., pixels, sound images as perceived by the ear, signal samples; subsymbolic units in neural networks can be considered particular cases of this category.

===Hybrid===
Hybrid computers are computers that exhibit features of analog computers and digital computers. The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical operations, while the analog component normally serves as a solver of differential equations. See more details at hybrid intelligent system.

==Dynamical systems==
In the traditional computational approach, representations are viewed as static structures of discrete symbols. Cognition takes place by transforming static symbol structures in discrete, sequential steps. Sensory information is transformed into symbolic inputs, which produce symbolic outputs that get transformed into motor outputs. The entire system operates in an ongoing cycle.

What is missing from this traditional view is that human cognition happens continuously and in real time. Breaking down the processes into discrete time steps may not fully capture this behavior. An alternative approach is to define a system with (1) a state of the system at any given time, (2) a behavior, defined as the change over time in overall state, and (3) a state set or state space, representing the totality of overall states the system could be in. The system is distinguished by the fact that a change in any aspect of the system state depends on other aspects of the same or other system states.

A typical dynamical model is formalized by several differential equations that describe how the system&#x27;s state changes over time. By doing so, the form of the space of possible trajectories and the internal and external forces that shape a specific trajectory that unfold over time, instead of the physical nature of the underlying mechanisms that manifest this dynamics, carry explanatory force. On this dynamical view, parametric inputs alter the system&#x27;s intrinsic dynamics, rather than specifying an internal state that describes some external state of affairs.

===Early dynamical systems===

====Associative memory====
Early work in the application of dynamical systems to cognition can be found in the model of Hopfield networks. These networks were proposed as a model for associative memory. They represent the neural level of memory, modeling systems of around 30 neurons which can be in either an on or off state. By letting the network learn on its own, structure and computational properties naturally arise. Unlike previous models, “memories” can be formed and recalled by inputting a small portion of the entire memory. Time ordering of memories can also be encoded. The behavior of the system is modeled with vectors which can change values, representing different states of the system. This early model was a major step toward a dynamical systems view of human cognition, though many details had yet to be added and more phenomena accounted for.

==== Language acquisition====
By taking into account the evolutionary development of the human nervous system and the similarity of the brain to other organs, Elman proposed that language and cognition should be treated as a dynamical system rather than a digital symbol processor. Neural networks of the type Elman implemented have come to be known as Elman networks. Instead of treating language as a collection of static lexical items and grammar rules that are learned and then used according to fixed rules, the dynamical systems view defines the lexicon as regions of state space within a dynamical system. Grammar is made up of attractors and repellers that constrain movement in the state space. This means that representations are sensitive to context, with mental representations viewed as trajectories through mental space instead of objects that are constructed and remain static. Elman networks were trained with simple sentences to represent grammar as a dynamical system. Once a basic grammar had been learned, the networks could then parse complex sentences by predicting which words would appear next according to the dynamical model.

====Cognitive development====
A classic developmental error has been investigated in the context of dynamical systems: The A-not-B error is proposed to be not a distinct error occurring at a specific age (8 to 10 months), but a feature of a dynamic learning process that is also present in older children. Children 2 years old were found to make an error similar to the A-not-B error when searching for toys hidden in a sandbox. After observing the toy being hidden in location A and repeatedly searching for it there, the 2-year-olds were shown a toy hidden in a new location B. When they looked for the toy, they searched in locations that were biased toward location A. This suggests that there is an ongoing representation of the toy&#x27;s location that changes over time. The child&#x27;s past behavior influences its model of locations of the sandbox, and so an account of behavior and learning must take into account how the system of the sandbox and the child&#x27;s past actions is changing over time.

====Locomotion====
One proposed mechanism of a dynamical system comes from analysis of continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs). By focusing on the output of the neural networks rather than their states and examining fully interconnected networks, three-neuron central pattern generator (CPG) can be used to represent systems such as leg movements during walking. This CPG contains three motor neurons to control the foot, backward swing, and forward swing effectors of the leg. Outputs of the network represent whether the foot is up or down and how much force is being applied to generate torque in the leg joint. One feature of this pattern is that neuron outputs are either off or on most of the time. Another feature is that the states are quasi-stable, meaning that they will eventually transition to other states. A simple pattern generator circuit like this is proposed to be a building block for a dynamical system. Sets of neurons that simultaneously transition from one quasi-stable state to another are defined as a dynamic module. These modules can in theory be combined to create larger circuits that comprise a complete dynamical system. However, the details of how this combination could occur are not fully worked out.

===Modern dynamical systems===

====Behavioral dynamics====
Modern formalizations of dynamical systems applied to the study of cognition vary. One such formalization, referred to as “behavioral dynamics”, treats the agent and the environment as a pair of coupled dynamical systems based on classical dynamical systems theory. In this formalization, the information from the environment informs the agent&#x27;s behavior and the agent&#x27;s actions modify the environment. In the specific case of perception-action cycles, the coupling of the environment and the agent is formalized by two functions. The first transforms the representation of the agents action into specific patterns of muscle activation that in turn produce forces in the environment. The second function transforms the information from the environment (i.e., patterns of stimulation at the agent&#x27;s receptors that reflect the environment&#x27;s current state) into a representation that is useful for controlling the agents actions. Other similar dynamical systems have been proposed (although not developed into a formal framework) in which the agent&#x27;s nervous systems, the agent&#x27;s body, and the environment are coupled together

=====Adaptive behaviors=====
Behavioral dynamics have been applied to locomotive behavior. Modeling locomotion with behavioral dynamics demonstrates that adaptive behaviors could arise from the interactions of an agent and the environment. According to this framework, adaptive behaviors can be captured by two levels of analysis. At the first level of perception and action, an agent and an environment can be conceptualized as a pair of dynamical systems coupled together by the forces the agent applies to the environment and by the structured information provided by the environment. Thus, behavioral dynamics emerge from the agent-environment interaction. At the second level of time evolution, behavior can be expressed as a dynamical system represented as a vector field. In this vector field, attractors reflect stable behavioral solutions, where as bifurcations reflect changes in behavior. In contrast to previous work on central pattern generators, this framework suggests that stable behavioral patterns are an emergent, self-organizing property of the agent-environment system rather than determined by the structure of either the agent or the environment.

====Open dynamical systems====
In an extension of classical dynamical systems theory, rather than coupling the environment&#x27;s and the agent&#x27;s dynamical systems to each other, an “open dynamical system” defines a “total system”, an “agent system”, and a mechanism to relate these two systems. The total system is a dynamical system that models an agent in an environment, whereas the agent system is a dynamical system that models an agent&#x27;s intrinsic dynamics (i.e., the agent&#x27;s dynamics in the absence of an environment). Importantly, the relation mechanism does not couple the two systems together, but rather continuously modifies the total system into the decoupled agent&#x27;s total system. By distinguishing between total and agent systems, it is possible to investigate an agent&#x27;s behavior when it is isolated from the environment and when it is embedded within an environment. This formalization can be seen as a generalization from the classical formalization, whereby the agent system can be viewed as the agent system in an open dynamical system, and the agent coupled to the environment and the environment can be viewed as the total system in an open dynamical system.

=====Embodied cognition=====
In the context of dynamical systems and embodied cognition, representations can be conceptualized as indicators or mediators. In the indicator view, internal states carry information about the existence of an object in the environment, where the state of a system during exposure to an object is the representation of that object. In the mediator view, internal states carry information about the environment which is used by the system in obtaining its goals. In this more complex account, the states of the system carries information that mediates between the information the agent takes in from the environment, and the force exerted on the environment by the agents behavior. The application of open dynamical systems have been discussed for four types of classical embodied cognition examples: 
# Instances where the environment and agent must work together to achieve a goal, referred to as &quot;intimacy&quot;. A classic example of intimacy is the behavior of simple agents working to achieve a goal (e.g., insects traversing the environment). The successful completion of the goal relies fully on the coupling of the agent to the environment.
# Instances where the use of external artifacts improves the performance of tasks relative to performance without these artifacts. The process is referred to as &quot;offloading&quot;. A classic example of offloading is the behavior of Scrabble players; people are able to create more words when playing Scrabble if they have the tiles in front of them and are allowed to physically manipulate their arrangement. In this example, the Scrabble tiles allow the agent to offload working memory demands on to the tiles themselves.
# Instances where a functionally equivalent external artifact replaces functions that are normally performed internally by the agent, which is a special case of offloading. One famous example is that of human (specifically the agents Otto and Inga) navigation in a complex environment with or without assistance of an artifact.
# Instances where there is not a single agent. The individual agent is part of larger system that contains multiple agents and multiple artifacts. One famous example, formulated by Ed Hutchins in his book &quot;Cognition in the Wild&quot;, is that of navigating a naval ship.
The interpretations of these examples rely on the following logic: (1) the total system captures embodiment; (2) one or more agent systems capture the intrinsic dynamics of individual agents; (3) the complete behavior of an agent can be understood as a change to the agent&#x27;s intrinsic dynamics in relation to its situation in the environment; and (4) the paths of an open dynamical system can be interpreted as representational processes. These embodied cognition examples show the importance of studying the emergent dynamics of an agent-environment systems, as well as the intrinsic dynamics of agent systems. Rather than being at odds with traditional cognitive science approaches, dynamical systems are a natural extension of these methods and should be studied in parallel rather than in competition.

<doc id="355242" wikidata="Q501979" url="?curid=355242" title="Maya Hero Twins">
<text>The Maya Hero Twins are the central figures of a narrative included within the colonial Kʼicheʼ document called Popol Vuh, and constituting the oldest Maya myth to have been preserved in its entirety. Called Hunahpu and Xbalanque in the Kʼicheʼ language, the Twins have also been identified in the art of the Classic Mayas (200–900 AD). The twins are often portrayed as complementary forces. 

The Twin motif recurs in many Native American mythologies; the Maya Twins, in particular, could be considered as mythical ancestors to the Maya ruling lineages.

==In word and image==

After being invited to Xibalba by One-Death and Seven-Death, the Lords of the Underworld, to a game of &quot;Pok Ta Pok&quot;, a Maya Ballgame, Hun Hunahpu (lit. One-Hunahpu) and Vucub Hunahpu (lit. Seven-Hunahpu) were defeated and executed as a result. Hun-Hunahpu&#x27;s head was put in a tree. When Blood Moon, the daughter of Blood Gatherer, one of the Lords of the Underworld, passes by the tree, his head speaks to her and then impregnates her with his spittle. Her father finds out that she is pregnant and convenes with One-Death and Seven-Death. They decide that if Blood Moon is not willing to tell them who the father is, she should be killed. Blood Moon truthfully answers that she has not slept with anyone, which is taken as a lie because she is visibly pregnant. Thus, they order their Owl Messengers to kill her and bring back her heart as proof. 

Blood Moon then tells the owls the truth and they agree to spare her. They create a faux heart out of red tree sap which they bring back to the Lords of the Underworld. The owls then show her the way to the world above. Here she goes to the house of Xmucane, the mother of Hun Hunahpu and Vucub Hunahpu, who lives with One-Monkey and One-Artisan, the firstborn children of Hun Hunahpu, which he conceived with Egret Woman. Blood Moon tells Xmucane she is pregnant with her grandchildren. Xmucane at first does not believe her and orders her—as a trial—to pick a big netful of corn ears from the garden of One-Monkey and One-Artisan. When Blood Moon arrives in the garden, however, there is only one maize plant. She calls upon the Guardians of Food and the corn plant magically produces enough ears to fill the net. 

Xmucane now recognizes that Blood Moon is telling the truth. She later gives birth to the children, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. The sons—or &#x27;Twins&#x27;—grow up to avenge their father, and after many trials, finally defeated the lords of the Underworld in a ballgame. The Popol Vuh features other episodes involving the Twins as well (see below), including the destruction of a pretentious bird demon, Vucub Caquix, and of his two demonic sons. The Twins also turned their half-brothers into the howler monkey gods, who were the patrons of artists and scribes. The Twins were finally transformed into sun and moon, signaling the beginning of a new age. The Qʼeqchiʼ myth of Sun and Moon, where Xbalanque is hunting for deer (a metaphor for making captives, deer is son of the Earth Deity as well), and capturing the daughter of the Earth Deity. In these cases, Hunahpu has no role to play.

===Iconography===

Another main source for Hero Twin mythology is much earlier and consists of representations found on Maya ceramics until about 900 AD and in the Dresden Codex some centuries later. Clearly recognizable are the figures of Hunahpu, Xbalanque, and the howler monkey scribes and sculptors. Hunahpu is distinguished by black spots on his skin, interpreted as the stains of a corpse or as pustules. On the Preclassic murals from San Bartolo, the king, marked with a black spot on the cheek, and drawing blood from his genitals in the four corners of the world, appears to personify the hero Hunahpu. Xbalanque—the &#x27;War Twin&#x27;—is more animal-like, in that he is distinguished by jaguar patches on his skin and by whiskers or a beard.

Certain iconographic scenes are suggestive of episodes in the Popol Vuh. The Twins&#x27; shooting of a steeply descending bird (the &#x27;Principal Bird Deity&#x27;) with blowguns may represent the defeat of Vucub-Caquix, whereas the principal Maya maize god rising from the carapace of a turtle in the presence of the Hero Twins may visualize the resurrection of the Twins&#x27; father, Hun-Hunahpu. This second scene has also been explained differently, however. In any case, the Twins are often depicted together with the main maize god, and these three semi-divinities were obviously felt to belong together. Therefore, it is probably no coincidence that in the Popol Vuh, the Twins are symbolically represented by two maize stalks.

===Names and calendrical functions===
The name &quot;Xbalanque&quot; (pronounced ) has been variously translated as &#x27;Jaguar Sun&#x27; (&quot;x-balam-que&quot;), &#x27;Hidden Sun&#x27; (&quot;x-balan-que&quot;), and &#x27;Jaguar Deer&#x27; (&quot;x-balam-quieh&quot;). The initial sound may stem from &quot;yax&quot; (precious), since in Classical Maya, a hieroglyphic element of this meaning precedes the pictogram of the hero (although it has also been suggested to be the female prefix &quot;ix-&quot;). For the combination of prefix and pictogram, a reading as &quot;Yax Balam&quot; has been proposed. The name &quot;Hunahpu&quot; (pronounced ) is usually understood as &quot;Hun-ahpub&quot; &#x27;One-Blowgunner&#x27;, the blowgun characterizing the youthful hero as a hunter of birds.

The head of Hunahpu is used as a variant sign for the 20th day in the day count or tzolkin, which in these cases may actually have been read as &quot;(Hun)ahpu&quot;, rather than &quot;Ahau&quot; (Lord or King). The 20th day is also the concluding day of all vigesimal periods, including the katun and baktun. The head of Xbalanque is used as a variant for the number nine (&quot;balan&quot; being similar to &quot;bolon&quot; &#x27;nine&#x27;).

==Twin myth summary==

The following is a detailed summary of the Popol Vuh Twin Myth, on from the death of the heroes&#x27; father and uncle.

===Early life of the heroes===
Hunahpu and his brother were conceived when their mother Xquic, daughter of one of the lords of Xibalba, spoke with the severed head of their father Hun. The skull spat upon the maiden&#x27;s hand, which caused the twins to be conceived in her womb. Xquic sought out Hun Hunahpu&#x27;s mother, who begrudgingly took her as a ward after setting up a number of trials to prove her identity.

Even after birth, Hunahpu and Xbalanque were not well treated by their grandmother or their older half-brothers, One Howler Monkey and One Artisan. Immediately after their births, their grandmother demanded they be removed from the house for their crying, and their elder brothers obliged by placing them on an anthill and among the brambles. Their intent was to kill their younger half-brothers out of jealousy and spite, for the older pair had long been revered as fine artisans and thinkers and feared the newcomers would steal from the attention they received.

The attempts to kill the young twins after birth were a failure, and the boys grew up without any obvious spite for their ill-natured older siblings. During their younger years, the twins were made to labor, going to hunt birds which they brought back for meals. The elder brothers were given their food to eat first, in spite of the fact they spent the day singing and playing while the younger twins were working.

Hunahpu and Xbalanque demonstrated their wit at a young age in dealing with their older half brothers. One day, the pair returned from the field without any birds to eat and were questioned by their older siblings. The younger boys claimed that they had indeed shot several birds but that they had gotten caught high in a tree and were unable to retrieve them. The older brothers were brought to the tree and climbed up to get the birds when the tree suddenly began to grow even taller, and the older brothers were caught. This is also the first instance in which the twins demonstrate supernatural powers, or perhaps simply the blessings of the greater gods; the feats of power are often only indirectly attributed to the pair.

Hunahpu further humiliated his older brethren by instructing them to remove their loincloths and tie them about their waists in an attempt to climb down. The loincloths became tails, and the brothers were transformed into monkeys. When their grandmother was informed that the older boys had not been harmed, she demanded they be allowed to return. When they did come back to the home, their grandmother was unable to contain her laughter at their appearance, and the disfigured brothers ran away in shame.

===Defeat of Seven Macaw and his family===

At a point in their lives not specified in the Popol Vuh, the twins were approached by the god Huracan regarding an arrogant god named Seven Macaw (Vucub Caquix). Seven Macaw had built up a following of worshipers among some of the inhabitants of the Earth, making false claims to be either the sun or the moon. Seven Macaw was also extremely vain, adorning himself with metal ornaments in his wings and a set of false teeth made of gemstones.

In a first attempt to dispatch the vain god, the twins attempted to sneak up on him as he was eating his meal in a tree, and shot at his jaw with a blowgun. Seven Macaw was knocked from his tree but only wounded, and as Hunahpu attempted to escape, his arm was grabbed by the god and torn off.

In spite of their initial failure, the twins again demonstrated their clever nature in formulating a plan for Seven Macaw&#x27;s defeat. Invoking a pair of gods disguised as grandparents, the twins instructed the invoked gods to approach Seven Macaw and negotiate for the return of Hunahpu&#x27;s arm. In doing so, the &quot;grandparents&quot; indicated they were but a poor family, making a living as doctors and dentists and attempting to care for their orphaned grandchildren. Upon hearing this, Seven Macaw requested that his teeth be fixed since they had been shot and knocked loose by the blowgun, and his eyes cured (it is not specifically said what ailed his eyes). In doing so, the grandparents replaced his jeweled teeth with white corn and plucked the ornaments he had about his eyes, leaving the god destitute of his former greatness. Having fallen, Seven Macaw died, presumably of shame.

Seven Macaw&#x27;s sons, Zipacna and Cabrakan, inherited a large part of their father&#x27;s arrogance, claiming to be the creators and destroyers of mountains, respectively. The elder son Zipacna was destroyed when the twins tricked him with the lure of a fake crab, burying him beneath a mountain in the process.

The Maya god Huracan again implored the young twins for help in dealing with Seven Macaw&#x27;s younger son, Cabrakan, the Earthquake. Again, it was primarily through their cleverness that the pair were able to bring about the downfall of their enemy, having sought him out and then using his very arrogance against him; they told the story of a great mountain they had encountered that kept growing and growing. Cabrakan prided himself as the one to bring down the mountains, and upon hearing such a tale, he predictably demanded to be shown the mountain. Hunahpu and Xbalanque obliged, leading Cabrakan toward the non-existent mountain. Being skilled hunters, they shot down several birds along the way, roasting them over fires and playing upon Cabrakan&#x27;s hunger. When he asked for some meat, he was given a bird that had been prepared with plaster and gypsum, a poison to the god. Upon eating it, he was weakened and the boys were able to bind him and cast him into a hole in the earth, burying him forever.

===Discovery of One Hunahpu&#x27;s gaming equipment===
Sometime after the expulsion of their older siblings, the twins used their special powers or abilities to expedite their gardening chores for their grandmother—a single swing of the axe would do a full day&#x27;s worth of clearing, for example. The pair covered themselves in dust and wood chippings when their grandmother approached to make it seem they had been hard at work, in spite of the fact they spent the whole day relaxing. However, the next day they returned to find their work undone by the animals of the forest. Upon completion of their work, they hid and lay in wait, and when the animals returned, they attempted to catch or scare them off.

Most animals eluded their capture. The rabbit and the deer they caught by the tail, but these tails broke off, thus giving all future generations of rabbits and deer short tails. The rat, however, they did capture, singeing his tail over the fire in revenge for the act. In exchange for mercy, the rat revealed an important piece of information: the gaming equipment of their father and uncle was hidden by their grandmother in her grief, for it was playing ball that was directly responsible for the deaths of her sons.

Again, a ruse was devised to get their equipment, the twins once more relying upon trickery to meet their goals. The pair sneaked the rat into their home during dinner and had their grandmother cook a meal of hot chili sauce. They demanded water for their meal, which their grandmother went to retrieve. The jar of water, however, had been sabotaged with a hole, and she was unable to return with the water. When their mother left to find out why and the pair were alone in the home, they sent the rat up into the roof to gnaw apart the ropes that held the equipment hidden and were able to retrieve the equipment their father and uncle had used to play ball. It had long been a favorite past-time for their father, and soon would become a favored activity for them as well.

===Xibalban ballgames===
Hunahpu and Xbalanque played ball in the same court that their father and his brother had played in long before them. When One Hunahpu and his brother had played, the noise had disturbed the Lords of Xibalba, rulers of the Maya Underworld. The Xibalbans summoned them to play ball in their own court.

When the twins began to play ball in the court, once again the Lords of Xibalba were disturbed by the racket, and sent summons to the boys to come to Xibalba and play in their court. Fearing they would suffer the same fate, their grandmother relayed the message only indirectly, telling it to a louse which was hidden in a toad&#x27;s mouth, which was in turn hidden in the belly of a snake in a falcon. Nevertheless, the boys did receive the message, and much to their grandmother&#x27;s dismay, set off to Xibalba.

When their father had answered the summons, he and his brother were met with a number of challenges along the way which served to confuse and embarrass them before their arrival, but the younger twins would not fall victim to the same tricks. They sent a mosquito ahead of them to bite at the Lords and uncover which were real and which were simply mannequins, as well as uncovering their identities. When they arrived at Xibalba, they were easily able to identify which were the real Lords of Xibalba and address them by name. They also turned down the Lords&#x27; invitation to sit on a bench for visitors, correctly identifying the bench as a heated stone for cooking. Frustrated by the twins&#x27; ability to see through their traps, they sent the boys away to the Dark House, the first of several deadly tests devised by the Xibalbans.

Their father and uncle had suffered embarrassing defeats in each of the tests, but again Hunahpu and Xbalanque demonstrated their prowess by outwitting the Xibalbans on the first of the tests. The twins placed macaw feathers in the torch and fireflies on the tips of their cigars, making the Xibalbans believe that they kept their torches and cigars lit all night. Dismayed, the Xibalbans bypassed the remaining tests and invited the boys directly to the game. The Xibalbans insisted on using their own ball for the game, and the twins consented. The ball, however, was a skull with a blade inside of it, and when Hunahpu hit the ball, the weapon was revealed. Complaining that they had been summoned only to be killed, Hunahpu and Xbalanque threatened to leave the game.

As a compromise, the Lords of Xibalba allowed the boys to use their own rubber ball, and a long and proper game ensued. In the end, the twins allowed the Xibalbans to win the game, but this was again a part of their ruse. They were sent to Razor House, the second deadly test of Xibalba, filled with knives that moved of their own accord. The twins spoke to the knives, and promised them the flesh of all animals in the future. In exchange, the knives stopped moving. Then, they sent leafcutter ants to retrieve petals from the gardens of Xibalba, a reward to be offered to the Lords for their victory. The Lords had intentionally chosen a reward they thought impossible, for the flowers were guarded by birds. The birds however, failed to notice as the ants trimmed the flowers. The Xibalbans were furious upon receiving bowls of their own flower petals, and split open the birds&#x27; beaks, giving nightjars their distinctive gape. 

Each of the following days resulted in a tied game and a new test. In the Cold House, the twins kept the cold at bay by pure willpower. In the Jaguar House, they fed the jaguars bones to survive. In the Fire House, the twins were sightly singed, but not burned. The Lords of Xibalba were dismayed at the twins success until the twins were placed in Bat House. Though they hid inside their blowguns from the deadly bats, Hunahpu peeked out to see if daylight had come, and was decapitated by a killer bat. 

Xbalanque summoned the beasts of the field and asked them to bring him their food. The coatimundi brought a squash, which Xbalanque placed on Hunahpu&#x27;s body. Xbalanque then asked the rabbit to distract the Xibalbans when the ball landed outside the court. The new game begun, and Hunahpu&#x27;s head was used as the ball. When Hunahpu&#x27;s head went off the court, however, the Xibalbans mistook the bouncing of the rabbit for the ball, and chased after it. Xbalanque then retrieved his brother&#x27;s head, and replaced the ball with the squash. The game continued until the squash burst, resulting in an embarrassing defeat for the Xibalbans.

===Downfall of Xibalba===
Embarrassed by their defeat, the Xibalbans still sought to destroy the twins. They had a great oven constructed and once again summoned the boys, intending to trick them into the oven and to their deaths. The twins realized that the Lords intended this ruse to be the end of them, yet, despite this, allowed themselves to be burned to death in the oven and the ashes of their bones ground into dust. The Xibalbans were elated at the apparent demise of the twins and cast their ashes into a river. This was, however, a part of the plan devised by the boys, for, once in the river, the ashes regenerated into bodies - at first those of a pair of catfish, which transformed in turn into those of a pair of young boys.

Unrecognized, the boys were allowed to remain among the Xibalbans. Tales of their transformation from catfish spread, as well as tales of their dances and the way they entertained the people of Xibalba. They performed a number of miracles, setting fire to homes and then bringing them back whole from the ashes, sacrificing one another and rising from the dead. When the Lords of Xibalba heard the tale, they summoned the pair to their court to entertain them, demanding to see such miracles for themselves.

The boys answered the summons and volunteered to entertain the Lords at no cost. Their identities remained secret for the moment, claiming to be orphans and vagabonds, and the Lords were none the wiser. They went through their gamut of miracles, slaying a dog and bringing it back from the dead, causing the Lords&#x27; house to burn around them while the inhabitants were unharmed, and then bringing the house back from the ashes. In a climactic performance, Xbalanque cut Hunahpu apart and offered him as a sacrifice, only to have the older brother rise once again from the dead.

Enthralled by the performance, One Death and Seven Death, the highest lords of Xibalba, demanded that the miracle be performed upon them. The twins obliged by killing and offering the lords as a sacrifice, but did not bring them back from the dead. The twins then shocked the Xibalbans by revealing their identities as Hunahpu and Xbalanque, sons of One Hunahpu whom they had slain years ago along with their uncle Seven Hunahpu. The Xibalbans despaired, confessed to the crimes of killing the brothers years ago, and begged for mercy. As a punishment for their crimes, the realm of Xibalba was no longer to be a place of greatness, and the Xibalbans would no longer receive offerings from the people who walked on the Earth above. All of Xibalba had effectively been defeated.

The twins returned to the ballcourt and retrieved the buried remains of their father, Hun Hunahpu. 

Their mission accomplished, the pair left Xibalba, climbing back to the surface of the Earth; but they did not, however, stop there and continued climbing straight on up into the sky - Hunahpu became the Sun, and Xbalanque became the Moon.

==Hero Twins in other Native American cultures==


Many Native American cultures in the United States have traditions of two male hero twins. 
For instance, in the creation myth of the Navajo (called the Diné Bahaneʼ) the hero twins Monster Slayer and Born for Water (sons of Changing Woman) acquire lightning bolt arrows from their father, the Sun, in order to rid the world of monsters that prey upon the people.

Ho-Chunk and other Siouan-speaking peoples have a tradition of Red Horn&#x27;s Sons. The mythology of Red Horn and his two sons have some interesting analogies with the Maya Hero Twins mythic cycle.

<doc id="355243" wikidata="Q3143447" url="?curid=355243" title="Hush, Little Baby">
<text>&quot;Hush, Little Baby&quot; is a traditional lullaby, thought to have been written in the Southern United States. The lyrics are from the point of view of a parent trying to appease an upset child by promising to give them a gift. Sensing the child&#x27;s apprehension, the parent has planned a series of contingencies in case their gift does not work out. The simple structure allows more verses to be added ad lib. It has a Roud number of 470.

== History and traditional versions ==
Like most folk songs, the author and date of origin are unclear. The English folklorist Cecil Sharp collected and notated a version from Endicott, Franklin County, Virginia in 1918, and another version sung by a Julie Boone of Micaville, North Carolina, with a complete version of the lyrics. A version recorded on a phonograph cylinder around 1929–35 in Durham, North Carolina by James Madison Carpenter can be heard online via the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website. 

Alan Lomax recorded several varying traditional renditions of the song in the southern United States in the 1930s and 40s, including from the traditional singer Texas Gladden. All of these versions differ melodically and lyrically, to varying degrees, from the now popular version.

One of the versions recorded by Lomax was that of the influential Appalachian musician Jean Ritchie, who performed a version in 1949 that had been passed down in her family. 

The Ritchie family version is identical to the versions which would later become famous. Due to the melodic and lyrical diversity of other traditional recordings and the fact that Ritchie shared a stage with and directly influenced artists who would later record the song such as The Weavers and Joan Baez, it is likely that the popular version of the song descends from Jean Ritchie&#x27;s Kentucky family.

== Popular versions ==
The song has been performed and recorded by many artists including Joan Baez, Burl Ives, Regina Spektor, Nina Simone, The Weavers and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Additionally, the song has been adapted into pop songs such as Maurice King&#x27;s &quot;Hambone&quot;, Inez and Charlie Foxx&#x27;s &quot;Mockingbird&quot; and Bo Diddley&#x27;s eponymous song &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, as well as Bobby McFerrin and Yo-Yo Ma&#x27;s &quot;Hush Little Baby&quot; and Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Mockingbird&quot;.

Aretha Franklin, Carly Simon, James Taylor, Etta James, Taj Mahal and Dusty Springfield have each recorded &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, which is an R&amp;B variant of the song.

== Lyrics ==
The most common version of the lyrics are:

There are many different versions of the song. It has a simple structure consisting of a series of rhyming couplets, where a gift is given to the little baby. In the next couplet, the gift is found faulty in some way, and a new gift is presented. The song continues in this pattern as long as the singer likes; and can come up with new gifts that fit the rhyming pattern. An example of some common couplets used in the transcript of the Target commercial &quot;Amase&quot; (1989):

<text>MozillaZine is a discontinued unofficial Mozilla website that provided information about Mozilla products including Firefox browser, Thunderbird email client, and related software (SeaMonkey, Camino, Calendar and Mobile). The site used to host an active community support internet forum, and a community-driven knowledge base of information about Mozilla products, but as of 2019 the site was not being maintained anymore. The site is still online in read-only mode.

==History==
The site was founded by Chris Nelson on September 1, 1998, just a few months after mozilla.org, which was created on February 23, 1998, and quickly grew in popularity. Improvements were added to the site and it soon moved to the codice_1 domain. Originally, the site&#x27;s main audience was Mozilla developers, both Netscape employees and outsiders, but it soon attracted interested observers and end users.

On November 14, 1998, MozillaZine merged with MozBin, which brought its webmaster, Jason Kersey, on board.

In the beginning of 2001, Chris Nelson phased out his involvement with the site.

In May 2002, Alex Bishop became the site&#x27;s third member of staff. Alex Bishop became less involved with the site in 2007.

After 2007, MozillaZine was primarily administrated by Jason Kersey.

In 2009, MozillaZine removed news section of the site due to lack of interest and since the open source project was well covered by other sources, including general and computer press. The home page was updated to remove the News and Blogs links. MozillaZine refocused on community software support and advocacy.

On September 20, 2019, site admin Jason Kersey announced his departure from the project and that MozillaZine would go into read-only mode. The site continued to operate, but without any administrator with root permissions on the server that hosts the forum.

<doc id="355247" wikidata="Q33467" url="?curid=355247" title="Mam language">
<text>Mam is a Mayan language spoken by about half a million Mam people in the Guatemalan departments of Quetzaltenango, Huehuetenango, San Marcos, and Retalhuleu, and the Mexican states of Campeche and Chiapas. Thousands more make up a Mam diaspora throughout the United States and Mexico, with notable populations living in Oakland, California and Washington, D.C. The most extensive Mam grammar is Nora C. England&#x27;s &quot;A grammar of Mam, a Mayan language&quot; (1983), which is based on the San Ildefonso Ixtahuacán dialect of Huehuetenango Department.

==Classification==

Mam is closely related to the Tektitek language, and the two languages together form the Mamean sub-branch of the Mayan language family. Along with the Ixilan languages, Awakatek and Ixil, these make up the Greater Mamean sub-branch, one of the two branches of the Eastern Mayan languages (the other being the Greater Quichean sub-branch, which consists of 10 Mayan languages, including Kʼicheʼ).

==Dialects==
Because contact between members of different Mam communities is somewhat limited, the language varies considerably even from village to village. Nevertheless, mutual intelligibility, though difficult, is possible through practice.

Mam varieties within Mexico and Guatemala are divided into five dialect groups:

*Northern Mam in Campeche, Mexico and southern Huehuetenango Department, Guatemala. Northern Mam is the least conservative group according to Terrence Kaufman.
*Southern Mam in southern Campeche, Mexico and Quetzaltenango Department, San Marcos Department, and Retalhuleu Department, Guatemala.
*Central Mam in Chiapas, Mexico and San Marcos Department, Guatemala.
*Western Mam in eastern Chiapas, Mexico and northwestern San Marcos Department, Guatemala. The Tektitek language may be mutually intelligible with Western Mam dialects.
*Soconusco Mam in the Soconusco region, Chiapas, Mexico

In addition to these, the dialects of Chiapas, Mexico are characterized by significant grammatical as well as lexical differences from the Guatemalan varieties.

==Distribution==
Mam is spoken in 64 communities in four Guatemalan departments and numerous communities in Campeche and Chiapas, Mexico. Neighboring languages include Jakaltek and Qʼanjobʼal to the north, Tektitek and Qato&#x27;k to the west, and Ixil, Awakatek, Sipacapense, and Kʼicheʼ to the east.

==Phonology==

===Stress===
Mam has weight sensitive stress assignment. Primary stress falls on the long vowel in a word if there is one, e.g. &#x27;work&#x27;. Words without a long vowel assign primary stress to the vowel preceding the last glottal stop, e.g. &#x27;dipper&#x27;. Words without a long vowel or a glottal stop assign stress to the vowel preceding the last consonant in the root, e.g. &#x27;raccoon&#x27;. Stress is not assigned to suffixes or enclitics that do not have long vowels or a glottal stop.

===Vowels===
Mam has 10 vowels, 5 short and 5 long:
*A mid-central vowel is an allophone of a short unstressed vowel that can occur in the syllable following a stressed long vowel.

===Consonants===
Mam has 27 consonants, including the glottal stop:

* Stop sounds /p, t, t͡s, t͡ʃ, t͡ʂ, k, q/ are released with aspiration [Cʰ] in word-final position.
* Todos Santos Mam has an extended amount of affricate consonants being apical palato-alveolar .

===Syllable structure===
Most roots take the morphological shape CVC. The only possible root final consonant cluster is -&quot;nC&quot;. Syllables can have up to four consonants in a cluster in any position. Most consonant clusters are the result of vowel dropping and morpheme addition.

==Morphology==
Mam has two sets of agreement markers, known to Mayanists as Set A and Set B markers, which can appear on both nouns and verbs. Mam uses Set A (ergative) markers on nouns to mark possessor agreement and on verbs to cross-reference the transitive subject. Mam uses Set B (absolutive) markers on transitive verbs to cross-reference the object and on intransitive verbs to cross-reference the subject. Below is a table of Set A (ergative) and Set B (absolutive) prefixes from England.

Phonologically conditioned allomorphs are as follows.
*n- ~ w-
**n- /__C
**w- /__V
*Ø ~ tz- ~ tzʼ- ~ k-
**k- /potential
**tzʼ- /__V initial root, non-potential
**tz- /__&quot;uul&quot; &#x27;arrive here&#x27;, &quot;iky&quot;&#x27; &#x27;pass by&#x27;, non-potential
**Ø- /__C, non-potential
*-a ~ -ya
**-ya /V__ ; In the first person in post-vowel environments, -&quot;ya&quot; varies freely with -&quot;kyʼa&quot; and -&quot;y&quot;&#x27;.
**-a /C__
Some paradigmatic examples from England (1983) are given below. Note that &quot;Ø-&quot; designates a null prefix. Additionally, &quot;ma&quot; is an aspectual word meaning &#x27;recent past&#x27;.


===The Mam verb complex===
Verbs in Mam can include inflection for person, aspect and mode, as well as auxiliaries in the form of directionals. The verb complex has distinct forms for transitive and intransitive verb stems depending in part on whether the complex cross-references one or two arguments. The lexical status of the verb complex is ambiguous. The inflections with vowels are phonologically independent (indicated by spaces). Transitive verb complexes with directionals have a dependent suffix. Two of England&#x27;s examples of intransitive and transitive verb complexes are shown below.

Intransitive verb complex with directional
Transitive verb complex with directional
Mam extends the Set A (ergative) person markers in the context of focused adverbials and certain subordinate clauses. In these contexts, the Set A markers cross-reference the subject of intransitive verbs and both the subject and object of transitive verbs. The following examples show the extended ergative marker /t-/ in bold.

*ikyʼ &#x27;passing&#x27;
*bʼaj &#x27;complete&#x27;

===Pronouns===
Mam has no independent pronouns. Rather, pronouns in Mam always exist as bound morphemes.

===Nouns===
The Mam language displays inalienable possession. Certain Mam nouns cannot be possessed, such as &quot;kya&#x27;j&quot; &#x27;sky&#x27; and &quot;che&#x27;w&quot; &#x27;star&#x27;. On the other hand, some Mam nouns are always possessed, such as &quot;t-lokʼ&quot; &#x27;its root&#x27; and &quot;t-bʼaqʼ&quot; &#x27;its seed&#x27;.

Noun phrase structure can be summarized into the following template.

The plural clitic is &quot;qa&quot;.

===Numerals===
San Ildefonso Ixtahuacán Mam numbers are as follows. Numbers above twenty are rarely used in Ixtahuacán and are usually only known by elderly speakers. Although the number system would have originally been vigesimal (i.e., base 20), the present-day number system of Ixtahuacán is now decimal.

==Syntax==
Mam has both verbal and non-verbal types of sentences. Verbal sentences have verbal predicates, whereas non-verbal sentences have a stative or a locative/existential predicate. Verbal predicates have an aspect marker, while non-verbal predicates do not have aspect marking. Both verbal and non-verbal predicates occur in sentence-initial position unless a focused or topicalized phrase is present.

===Verbal predicates===
Verbal predicates are either transitive or intransitive according to the number of arguments cross-referenced in the verb complex. The number of arguments cross-referenced by the verb complex is not consistent with the transitivity of the verb root or the number of participants in an event. England notes examples of transitive verb roots that only appear in their antipassive or passive forms where they only cross-reference a single participant.

*Transitive verb root with obligatory antipassive voice
*Transitive verb root with obligatory passive voice
Another possibility is the use of intransitive motion verbs to express transitive events.

*Intransitive motion verbs expressing transitive events


The basic word order in verbal sentences with two nominal arguments is VSO. Other word orders are not acceptable.

If only one argument appears in a transitive sentence and the argument is compatible with either person marker on the verb, it has a patient interpretation.

Mam speakers use a higher proportion of intransitive sentences than speakers of other Mayan languages. England and Martin (2003) found a low frequency of transitive sentences in Mam texts. Pye (2017) found a low use of overt subjects in transitive sentences in adults speaking to children. One adult produced overt subjects in 6% of transitive sentences. The same adult produced overt subjects in 41% of intransitive sentences and produced overt objects in 49% of transitive sentences.

===Non-verbal predicates===
Mam adds Set B person markers to nouns and adjectives to form non-verbal predicates. The following Set B person markers are used for non-verbal predicates (i.e., nouns, adjectives). Also, in statives, &quot;aa&quot; can be omitted when the rest of the stative is a non-enclitic (in other words, a separate, independent word).


Paradigmatic examples of non-verbal predicates from England (1983) are given below.

==Child Language==
An overview of child language acquisition in Mam can be found in Pye (2017). Child language data for Mam challenge many theories of language acquisition and demonstrate the need for more extensive documentation of native American languages.

Children acquiring Mam produce a higher proportion of verbs than children acquiring K’iche’, but a lower proportion of verbs compared to children acquiring Wastek and Chol. They produce a higher proportion of intransitive verbs relative to transitive verbs than children acquiring other Mayan languages (Pye, Pfeiler and Mateo Pedro 2017:22). Their high proportion of relational noun production is tied to their frequent use of intransitive verbs.

The following examples illustrate the children&#x27;s use of intransitive verbs to express events with two participants. Ages are shown as (years;months.days). WEN (2;0.2) used the intransitive verb (&quot;go_down&quot;) in reference to an event of picking coffee. She used the relational noun phrase to express the agent in an oblique phrase. CRU (2;5.12) used the intransitive verb (&quot;go_out&quot;) in reference to an event of taking out an object. She used the relational noun phrase to express the agent. JOS (2;6.17) used the intransitive verb (&quot;finish&quot;) in reference to finishing a drink. He used the possessive prefix on the noun (&quot;drink&quot;)to express the agent. The examples overturn the hypothesis that children tie their use of transitive verbs to object manipulation events.

*WEN (2;0.2) 
*CRU (2;5.12) 
*JOS (2;6.17) 
Two-year-old Mam children produce the consonants . They produce in place of glottalized stops, in place of , in place of and , in place of and , in place of , and in place of . Mam children begin producing ejective consonants after they are three and a half years old. The early production of /t͡ʃ/ and /l/ in Mam, as well as the late production of /s/, overturns predictions that all children have similar phonologies due to articulatory development.

The following examples illustrate WEN’s verb complex production. In (1), WEN produced the vowel /a/ from the verb root (&quot;give&quot;), the imperative suffix -n, and the directional suffix -tz as /xh/. (Many directionals have contracted forms as suffixes.). WEN omitted the person enclitic -a. In (2), WEN produced the progressive prefix n-, the vowel /e/ from the verb root (&quot;go out&quot;), a spurious /n/, and the directional suffix -tz as /ch/. The intransitive verb belongs to the class of motion verbs that take directional suffixes. Intransitive verbs outside of the class of motion verbs do not take directional suffixes except in imperative contexts. The verb contracts with the directional suffix -tz to produce the stem (&quot;go out to&quot;) in adult speech. WEN’s omission of the person enclitic and production of a spurious consonant overturn the hypothesis that children produce forms that are frequent in adult speech.

*WEN (1;9.2) 
*WEN (1;8.21) 
The children’s production of the directional suffixes demonstrates their early recognition of the distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs in Mam. This distinction is a core feature of Mam grammar, and underpins the ergative morphology on the verbs and nouns. The semantic diversity of the verbs and positionals overturns the hypothesis that children use prototypical activity scenes as a basis for constructing grammatical categories. The children’s grammatical acumen is best seen in their use of the ergative and absolutive agreement markers on verbs. The children produced the prevocalic allomorphs of the ergative markers in nearly all of their obligatory contexts. They produced the preconsonantal allomorphs of the ergative markers in 20% of their obligatory contexts.

Two-year-old Mam children display a remarkable awareness of the contexts for extending the use of ergative markers to cross-reference the subject of intransitive verbs. Outside of these contexts, they consistently produced absolutive person markers on intransitive verbs. Three Mam children produced ergative person markers on intransitive verbs in half of the obligatory contexts for extended ergativity. The children’s awareness of the contexts for extended ergative use is all the more remarkable because the contexts are tied to clauses in dependent contexts in which aspect is not overtly marked. The following example shows JOS’s use of extended ergative marking (in bold) on the intransitive verb (&quot;go_in&quot;) in a purpose clause headed by the adverb (&quot;so that&quot;). The children’s production of ergative markers on intransitive verbs in dependent contexts overturns the theory that children link ergative markers to the subjects of transitive verbs in all contexts.

*JOS (2;6.14) 
Mam two-year-olds produce sentences with a predicate-initial word order. The children, like adults, rarely produce the subject argument in transitive sentences. The Mam children show an ergative pattern of argument production that similar to the adult pattern.

<doc id="355254" wikidata="Q45914" url="?curid=355254" title="Maya peoples">
<text>The Maya () are an ethnolinguistic group of indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. The ancient Maya civilization was formed by members of this group, and today&#x27;s Maya are generally descended from people who lived within that historical region. Today they inhabit southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and westernmost El Salvador and Honduras. 

&quot;Maya&quot; is a modern collective term for the peoples of the region; however, the term was not historically used by the indigenous populations themselves. There was no common sense of identity or political unity among the distinct populations, societies and ethnic groups because they each had their own particular traditions, cultures and historical identity.

It is estimated that seven million Maya were living in this area at the start of the 21st century. Guatemala, southern Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula, Belize, El Salvador, and western Honduras have managed to maintain numerous remnants of their ancient cultural heritage. Some are quite integrated into the majority westernised &quot;mestizo&quot; cultures of the nations in which they reside, while others continue a more traditional, culturally distinct life, often speaking one of the Mayan languages as a primary language.

== Yucatan Peninsula ==
One of the largest groups of Maya live in the Yucatan Peninsula, which includes the Mexican states of Yucatán State, Campeche, and Quintana Roo as well as the nation of Belize. These people identify themselves as &quot;Maya&quot; with no further ethnic subdivision (unlike in the Highlands of Western Guatemala). They speak the language which anthropologists term &quot;Yucatec Maya&quot;, but is identified by speakers and Yucatecos simply as &quot;Maya&quot;. Among Maya speakers, Spanish is commonly spoken as a second or first language.
There is a significant amount of confusion as to the correct terminology to use—Maya or Mayan—and the meaning of these words with reference to contemporary or pre-Columbian peoples, to Maya peoples in different parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and to languages or peoples.

Linguists refer to the Maya language as Yucatec or Yucatec Maya to distinguish it from other Mayan languages. This norm has often been misinterpreted to mean that the people are also called Yucatec Maya; that term refers to only the language, and the correct name for the people is simply Maya (not Mayans). (Yucatec) Maya is one language in the Mayan language family. Confusion of the term Maya/Mayan as an ethnic label occurs because Maya women who use traditional dress identify by the ethnic term &quot;mestiza&quot; and not Maya.

Persons use a strategy of ethnic identification that Juan Castillo Cocom refers to as &quot;ethnoexodus&quot;—meaning that ethnic self-identification as Maya is quite variable, situational, and articulated not to processes of producing group identity, but of escaping from discriminatory processes of sociocultural marginalization.

The Yucatán&#x27;s indigenous population was first exposed to Europeans after a party of Spanish shipwreck survivors came ashore in 1511. One of the sailors, Gonzalo Guerrero, is reported to have taken up with a local woman and started a family; he became a war captain in the Postclassic Mayan state of Chetumal. Later Spanish expeditions to the region were led by Córdoba in 1517, Grijalva in 1518, and Cortés in 1519. From 1528 to 1540, several attempts by Francisco Montejo to conquer the Yucatán failed. His son, Francisco de Montejo the Younger, fared almost as badly when he first took over: while invading Chichen Itza, he lost 150 men in a single day. European diseases, massive recruitment of native warriors from Campeche and Champoton, and internal hatred between the Xiu Maya and the lords of Cocom eventually turned the tide for Montejo the Younger. Chichen Itza was conquered by 1570. In 1542, the western Yucatán Peninsula also surrendered to him.
Historically, the population in the eastern half of the peninsula was less affected by and less integrated than the western half. In the 21st century in the Yucatán Peninsula (Mexican states of Campeche, Yucatán and Quintana Roo), between 750,000 and 1,200,000 people speak Mayan. However, three times more than that are of Maya origins, hold ancient Maya surnames, and do not speak Mayan languages as their first language.

Matthew Restall, in his book &quot;The Maya Conquistador&quot;, mentions a series of letters sent to the King of Spain in the 16th and 17th centuries. The noble Maya families at that time signed documents to the Spanish royal family; surnames mentioned in those letters are Pech, Camal, Xiu, Ucan, Canul, Cocom, and Tun, among others.

A large 19th-century revolt by the native Maya people of Yucatán (Mexico), known as the Caste War of Yucatán, was one of the most successful modern Native American revolts. For a period the Maya state of Chan Santa Cruz was recognized as an independent nation by the British Empire, particularly in terms of trading with British Honduras.
Francisco Luna-Kan was elected governor of the state of Yucatán from 1976 to 1982. Luna-Kan was born in Mérida, Yucatán, and he was a doctor of medicine, then a professor of medicine before his political offices. He was first appointed as overseer of the state&#x27;s rural medical system. He was the first governor of the modern Yucatán Peninsula to be of full Maya ancestry. In the early 21st century, dozens of politicians, including deputies, mayors and senators, are of full or mixed Maya heritage from the Yucatán Peninsula.

According to the National Institute of Geography and Informatics (Mexico&#x27;s INEGI), in Yucatán State there were 1.2 million Mayan speakers in 2009, representing just under 60% of the inhabitants. Due to this, the cultural section of the government of Yucatán began on-line classes for grammar and proper pronunciation of Maya.

Maya people from Yucatán Peninsula living in the United States of America have been organizing Maya language lessons and Maya cooking classes since 2003 in California and other states: clubs of Yucatec Maya are registered in Dallas and Irving, Texas; Salt Lake City in Utah; Las Vegas, Nevada; and California, with groups in San Francisco; San Rafael; Chino; Pasadena; Santa Ana; Garden Grove; Inglewood; Los Angeles; Thousand Oaks; Oxnard; San Fernando Valley and Whittier. Maya language is taught at the college and graduate level; beginning, intermediate, and advanced courses in Maya have been taught at Indiana University since 2010. The Open School of Ethnography and Anthropology offers immersion Maya courses in a six-week intensive summer program.

==Chiapas==

Chiapas was for many years one of the regions of Mexico that was least touched by the reforms of the Mexican Revolution. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation, launched a rebellion against the Mexican state, Chiapas in January 1994, declared itself to be an indigenous movement and drew its strongest and earliest support from Chiapan Maya. Today its number of supporters is relevant. (see also the EZLN and the Chiapas conflict)

Maya groups in Chiapas include the Tzotzil and Tzeltal, in the highlands of the state, the Tojolabalis concentrated in the lowlands around Las Margaritas, the Chʼol in the jungle, and in the south eastern uplands, the endangered Mochó and the Kaqchikel, also widely spoken in the Guatemalan highlands. (See map. Note. The Zoque are not Maya.)

The most traditional of Maya groups are the Lacandon, a small population avoiding contact with outsiders until the late 20th century by living in small groups in the Lacandon Jungle. These Lacandon Maya came from the Campeche/Petén area (north-east of Chiapas) and moved into the Lacandon rain-forest at the end of the 18th century.

In the course of the 20th century, and increasingly in the 1950s and 1960s, other people (mainly the Maya and subsistence peasants from the highlands), also entered into the Lacandon region; initially encouraged by the government. This immigration led to land-related conflicts and an increasing pressure on the rainforest. To halt the migration, the government decided in 1971 to declare a large part of the forest (614,000 hectares, or 6140 km2) a protected area: the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve. They appointed only one small population group (the 66 Lacandon families) as tenants (thus creating the Lacandon Community), thereby displacing 2000 Tzeltal and Chʼol families from 26 communities, and leaving non-Lacandon communities dependent on the government for granting their rights to land. In the decades that followed the government carried out numerous programs to keep the problems in the region under control, using land distribution as a political tool; as a way of ensuring loyalty from different campesino groups. This strategy of divide and rule led to great disaffection and tensions among population groups in the region.
(see also the Chiapas conflict and the Lacandon Jungle).

==Belize==

The Maya population in Belize is concentrated in the Corozal, Cayo, Toledo and Orange Walk districts, but are scattered throughout the country. The Maya are thought to have been in Belize and the Yucatán region since the second millennium BC. Much of Belize&#x27;s original Maya population died as a result of new infectious diseases and conflicts between tribes and with Europeans. They are divided into the Yucatec, Kekchi, and Mopan. These three Maya groups now inhabit the country.

The Yucatec Maya (many of whom came from Yucatán, Mexico to escape the Caste War of the 1840s) there have been evidence of several Yucatec Maya groups living by the Yalbac area of Belize and in the Orange Walk district near the present day Lamanai at the time the British reach. The Mopan (indigenous to Belize but were forced out by the British; they returned from Guatemala to evade slavery in the 19th century), and Kekchi (also fled from slavery in Guatemala in the 19th century). The latter groups are chiefly found in the Toledo District.

==Tabasco==

The Mexican state of Tabasco is home to the Chontal Maya. Tabasco is a Mexican state with a northern coastline fringing the Gulf of Mexico. In its capital, Villahermosa, Parque Museo la Venta is known for its zoo and colossal stone sculptures dating to the Olmec civilization. The grand Museo de Historia de Tabasco chronicles the area from prehistoric times, while the Museo Regional de Antropología has exhibits on native Maya and Olmec civilizations.

==Guatemala==

In Guatemala, indigenous people of Maya descent comprise around 42% of the population. Many Maya still experience discrimination and oppression. The largest Maya populations are found in the western highlands where they make up the majority of populations in the departments of Baja Verapaz, Quiché, Totonicapán, Huehuetenango, Quetzaltenango, and San Marcos.

The Maya people of the Guatemala highlands include the Achi, Akatek, Chuj, Ixil, Jakaltek, Kaqchikel, Kʼicheʼ, Mam, Poqomam, Poqomchiʼ, Qʼanjobʼal, Qʼeqchiʼ, Tzʼutujil and Uspantek.

The Qʼeqchiʼ live in lowland areas of Alta Vera Paz, Peten, and Western Belize. Over the course of the succeeding centuries a series of land displacements, re-settlements, persecutions and migrations resulted in a wider dispersal of Qʼeqchiʼ communities, into other regions of Guatemala (Izabal, Petén, El Quiché). They are the second-largest ethnic Maya group in Guatemala (after the Kʼicheʼ) and one of the largest and most widespread throughout Central America.

In Guatemala, the Spanish colonial pattern of keeping the native population legally separate and subservient continued well into the 20th century. This resulted in many traditional customs being retained, as the only other option than traditional Maya life open to most Maya was entering the westeren culture at the very bottom rung. Because of this many Guatemalan Maya, especially women, continue to wear traditional clothing, that varies according to their specific local identity.

The southeastern region of Guatemala (bordering with Honduras) includes groups such as the Chʼortiʼ. The northern lowland Petén region includes the Itza, whose language is near extinction but whose agroforestry practices, including use of dietary and medicinal plants may still tell us much about pre-colonial management of the Maya lowlands.

=== History ===
The Classic period of Mesoamerican civilization corresponds to the height of the Maya civilization. It is represented by countless sites throughout Guatemala, although the largest concentration is in Petén. This period is characterized by urbanisation, the emergence of independent city-states, and contact with other Mesoamerican cultures.

This lasted until approximately 900 AD, when the Classic Maya civilization collapsed. The Maya abandoned many of the cities of the central lowlands or were killed by a drought-induced famine. 

=== Genocide ===


The 36-year-long Guatemalan Civil War from 1960 to 1996 left more than 200,000 people dead, a half-million people driven from their homes, and at least 100,000 women raped; most of the victims were Maya.

The genocide against Mayan people took place throughout the whole civil war because indigenous people were seen as supporting the leftist guerillas, but most acts against humanity occurred during Efraín Ríos Montt&#x27;s presidency (1982–1983). Ríos Montt instituted a campaign of state terror intended to destroy the Mayas in the name of countering &quot;communist subversion&quot; and ridding the country of its indigenous culture. This was also known as Operation Sofia. Within Operation Sofia, the military followed through with &quot;scorched earth policies&quot; which allowed them to destroy whole villages, including killing livestock, destroying cultural symbols, destroying crops, and murdering civilians. In some areas, government forces killed about 40% of the total population; the campaign destroyed at least 626 Mayan villages.

On January 26, 2012, former president Ríos Montt was formally indicted in Guatemala for overseeing the massacre of 1,771 civilians of the Ixil Maya group and appeared in court for genocide and crimes against humanity for which he was then sentenced to 80 years in prison on May 10, 2013. This ruling was overturned by the constitutional court on May 20, 2013, over alleged irregularities in the handling of the case. The ex-president appeared in court again on January 5, 2015, amongst protest from his lawyers regarding his health conditions and on August 25, 2015, it was deliberated that a re-trial of the 2013 proceedings could find Ríos Montt guilty or not, but that the sentence would be suspended. Ríos Montt died on April 1, 2018, of a heart attack.

===Maya heritage===
The Maya people are known for their brightly colored, yarn-based, textiles that are woven into capes, shirts, blouses, huipiles and dresses. Each village has its own distinctive pattern, making it possible to distinguish a person&#x27;s home town. Women&#x27;s clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirt.

The Maya religion is Roman Catholicism combined with the indigenous Maya religion to form the unique syncretic religion which prevailed throughout the country and still does in the rural regions. Beginning from negligible roots prior to 1960, however, Protestant Pentecostalism has grown to become the predominant religion of Guatemala City and other urban centers, and mid-sized towns. The unique religion is reflected in the local saint, Maximón, who is associated with the subterranean force of masculine fertility and prostitution. Always depicted in black, he wears a black hat and sits on a chair, often with a cigar placed in his mouth and a gun in his hand, with offerings of tobacco, alcohol, and Coca-Cola at his feet. The locals know him as San Simon of Guatemala.

The Popol Vuh is the most significant work of Guatemalan literature in the Kʼicheʼ language, and one of the most important works of Pre-Columbian American literature. It is a compendium of Maya stories and legends, aimed to preserve Maya traditions. The first known version of this text dates from the 16th century and is written in Quiché transcribed in Latin characters. It was translated into Spanish by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez in the beginning of the 18th century. Due to its combination of historical, mythical, and religious elements, it has been called the Maya Bible. It is a vital document for understanding the culture of Pre-Columbian America. The Rabinal Achí is a dramatic work consisting of dance and text that is preserved as it was originally represented. It is thought to date from the 15th century and narrates the mythical and dynastic origins of the Toj Kʼicheʼ rulers of Rabinal, and their relationships with neighboring Kʼicheʼ of Qʼumarkaj. The Rabinal Achí is performed during the Rabinal festival of January 25, the day of Saint Paul. It was declared a masterpiece of oral tradition of humanity by UNESCO in 2005. The 16th century saw the first native-born Guatemalan writers that wrote in Spanish.

==Maya cultural heritage tourism==
There is often a relationship between cultural heritage, tourism, and a national identity. In the case of the Maya, the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism. By focusing on lifeways through costumes, rituals, diet, handicrafts, language, housing, or other features, the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of culture.

Global tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods, services, and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change. Estimated that between 35 and 40 per cent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism, this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place-based engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples, as well as sites and objects of global historical significance. In this production of tourism the use of historic symbols, signs, and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation building.

With this type of tourism, people argue that ethno-commerce may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds. Tourists travel with cultural expectations, which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions, often developed at the expense of local tradition and meanings.

An example of this can be seen in &quot;Mayanizing Tourism on Roatan Island, Honduras: Archaeological Perspectives on Heritage, Development, and Indignity.&quot; Alejandro J. Figueroa et al., combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on Roatan Island, Honduras, have become increasingly &quot;Mayanized&quot; over the past decade. As tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized Maya past for the island, non-Maya archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed. While heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some, it can devalue contributions made by less familiar groups.

<text>Generalfeldmarschall (; from Old High German &quot;marahscalc&quot;, &quot;marshal, stable master, groom&quot;; ; often abbreviated to Feldmarschall) was a rank in the armies of several German states and the Holy Roman Empire, (&quot;Reichsgeneralfeldmarschall&quot;); in the Habsburg monarchy, the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary, the rank &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; was used. The rank was the equivalent to &quot;Großadmiral&quot; () in the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, a five-star rank, comparable to OF-10 in today&#x27;s NATO naval forces.

==Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary==

The rank existed in the Austrian Empire as &quot;Kaiserlicher Feldmarschall&quot; (&quot;imperial field marshal&quot;) and in Austria-Hungary as &quot;Kaiserlicher und königlicher Feldmarschall&quot; - &quot;Császári és királyi tábornagy&quot; (&quot;imperial and royal field marshal&quot;). Both were based on prior usage during the Holy Roman Empire. The Emperor-King held the rank &quot;ex officio&quot;, other officers were promoted as required. Between 1914 and 1918, ten men attained this rank, of whom four were members of the reigning Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty.

==Germany and Prussia==

===Kingdom of Prussia and German Empire===
In the Royal Prussian Army, the subsequent Imperial German Army and later in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; of Nazi Germany, the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; had several privileges, such as elevation to nobility, equal protocol rank with Cabinet ministers, the right of reporting directly to the monarch, and a constant escort.

In 1854, the rank of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; (colonel general) was created in order to promote Wilhelm, Crown Prince of Prussia (the later Wilhelm I, German Emperor) to senior rank without breaking the rule that only wartime field commanders could receive the rank of field marshal for a victory in a decisive battle or the capture of a fortification or major town. The equivalent of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; in the German Navy was &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; (general admiral or admiral-general).

In 1870, Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia and Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm—who had commanded armies during the Franco-Prussian War—became the first Prussian princes appointed to the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;.

The exalted nature of the rank was underscored during World War I, when only five German officers (excluding honorary promotions to members of royal families and foreign officers) were designated &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;: Paul von Hindenburg, August von Mackensen, Karl von Bülow, Hermann von Eichhorn, and Remus von Woyrsch. Only a single naval officer, Henning von Holtzendorff, was designated Grand Admiral. Not even such well-known German commanders as Erich Ludendorff, Erich von Falkenhayn, or Reinhard Scheer received marshal&#x27;s batons or Grand Admiral rank.

===Nazi Germany===

Before the Second World War, Adolf Hitler reintroduced the rank into the with the promotion of the Reich Minister of War, &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Werner von Blomberg (20 April 1936), and the Aviation Minister, Hermann Göring (4 February 1938), to the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;. In the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; of Nazi Germany during the Second World War, the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; remained the highest military rank until July 1940, when Hermann Göring was promoted to the newly created higher rank of &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot;. The equivalent of a &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; in the navy was &quot;Großadmiral&quot; (grand admiral).

Unlike Kaiser Wilhelm II, Hitler distributed the rank more widely, promoting 25 &quot;Heer&quot; and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; officers in total and two &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; Grand Admirals. (Another promotion, that of Austrian General Eduard von Böhm-Ermolli, was honorary.) Four weeks after the &quot;Heer&quot; and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had won the Battle of France, Hitler promoted nine Army generals and three of the air force to the rank of field marshal on 19 July 1940: Walther von Brauchitsch, Wilhelm Keitel, Gerd von Rundstedt, Fedor von Bock, Wilhelm von Leeb, Wilhelm List, Günther von Kluge, Erwin von Witzleben and Walter von Reichenau (of the &quot;Heer&quot;); and Albert Kesselring, Erhard Milch and Hugo Sperrle (of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;). The holders of this rank had the right to a “direct presentation to the Führer”.

In 1942, three other men were promoted—&quot;Wüstenfuchs&quot; (&#x27;Desert Fox&#x27;) Erwin Rommel (22 June) for the siege of Tobruk, Erich von Manstein (30 June) for the Siege of Sevastopol, and Georg von Küchler (30 June) for his success as &quot;Oberbefehlshaber der Heeresgruppe Nord&quot; (commander-in-chief of Army Group North).

Hitler promoted Friedrich Paulus, commander of the 6th Army at the Battle of Stalingrad, to the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; via field radio on 30 January 1943, a day before his army&#x27;s inevitable surrender, in order to encourage him to continue to fight until death or commit suicide. In the promotion, Hitler noted that no German or, before that, Prussian field marshal had ever been captured alive. &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Paulus surrendered the following day anyway, claiming, &quot;Ich habe nicht die Absicht, mich für diesen bayerischen Gefreiten zu erschießen.&quot; (&quot;I have no intention of shooting myself for this Bavarian corporal.&quot;) A disappointed Hitler commented, &quot;That&#x27;s the last field marshal I make in this war!&quot; Nevertheless, he appointed seven more, three on the very day following Paulus&#x27; surrender: Ernst Busch, Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist and Maximilian von Weichs (all members of the &quot;Heer&quot;). Later that same month, Hitler promoted &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; General Wolfram von Richthofen to the rank for his service in the Crimean campaign, and the later part of the Battle of Stalingrad.

From 1944 to 1945, three more men would reach this rank. In early 1944, Walter Model, one of Hitler&#x27;s most loyal generals, was promoted to the rank; he was also the last German field marshal to receive a ceremonial marshal&#x27;s baton. Ferdinand Schörner, another loyal officer, was promoted on 5 April 1945. Three weeks later, he was made Commander-in-Chief of the German Army in Hitler&#x27;s last will and testament. On 25 April, just five days before his own suicide, Adolf Hitler made &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; General Robert Ritter von Greim a field marshal and commander in chief of the German Air Force after Göring had fallen out of Hitler&#x27;s favour, making Greim the last German field marshal in history.

Financially, the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; in Nazi Germany was very rewarding as, apart from a yearly salary, Hitler introduced tax free fringe benefits for generals in the range of 
(€– in ) per month in 1940. He also bestowed generous presents on his highest officers, with Leeb receiving (€ in ) for his 65th birthday from Hitler.

Promotion to the rank did not guarantee Hitler&#x27;s ongoing favour, however. As the tide of the war turned, Hitler took out his frustrations on his top commanders, relieving most of the &quot;Generalfeldmarschalls&quot; of duty before the war&#x27;s conclusion. Bock, Brauchitsch, Leeb, and List were all relieved of their posts in 1942 for perceived failures during Operation Barbarossa and took no further active part in the war. Kleist, Manstein and Sperrle were similarly retired in 1944 and Rundstedt and Weichs in March 1945. Grand Admiral Erich Raeder was retired in January 1943 following a fierce argument with Hitler over the future of the German surface fleet. Model, one of Hitler&#x27;s most successful commanders, had nevertheless lost the Fuhrer&#x27;s confidence by war&#x27;s end and committed suicide to avoid capture and likely trial as a war criminal. Milch was relieved after conspiring unsuccessfully to have Göring removed from command of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, and even Göring himself was stripped of his offices and expelled from the Nazi Party in Hitler&#x27;s last days. Schörner ignominiously abandoned his command to save himself in the war&#x27;s last days. Kluge, Witzleben and Rommel were either executed or forced to commit suicide for their real or imagined roles in the 20 July plot against Hitler. By war&#x27;s end, only Keitel, Kesselring, Greim and Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz were still in positions of military responsibility.

===East Germany===
The National People&#x27;s Army of the &quot;Deutsche Demokratische Republik&quot; (DDR) (German Democratic Republic, i.e. East Germany) created the rank of Marshal of the German Democratic Republic on 25 March 1982. A general could be appointed to this rank by the State Council (&quot;Staatsrat&quot;; the head-of-state council of the GDR) during wartime or for exceptional military achievement; no one ever held the rank, however.

===Modern Germany===
The ranks of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;, &quot;Generaloberst&quot;, &quot;Großadmiral&quot; and &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; no longer exist in the new German (until 1990 West German) Armed Forces, the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, which were created in 1956. Currently, the highest military grades in the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; are general and admiral.

The Commander-in-Chief of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; is, in peacetime, according to Article 65a of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (constitution), the civilian Federal Minister of Defence, who holds supreme command authority over all soldiers. In wartime, during the State of Defence, that supreme command authority is transferred to the &quot;Federal Chancellor&quot;. The Inspector General of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; is the military chief of defence and heads the &quot;Armed Forces Command Staff&quot; ().

==Other states to have used the title==

===Electorate (1356–1806) and Kingdom of Saxony (1806–1918)===

The rank of Field Marshal was first used in the northern German State of Saxony within the Holy Roman Empire in 1631. It was then used nine further times in that century and seven times in the 18th century. It was used twice in the 19th century by the Kingdom of Saxony after it became part of the German Empire in 1871.

=== Ethiopia ===
The rank of Field Marshal General was first used in Ethiopia in 2022. On 8 January 2022, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed presided over the Ethiopian National Defense Force promotion ceremony, that saw the rank be introduced to Birhanu Jula, Chief of General Staff.

=== Russia ===
The Rank of General-Field marshal (Russian: Генерал-фельдмаршал) was used in the Russian Empire until 1917 when the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, as part of the rank system being abolished as a whole, abolished it. In 1935, it was reintroduced as the Marshal of the Soviet Union (Russian: Маршал Советского Союза) under Joseph Stalin, which lasted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1993, with the declaration of the Russian Federation, it was reintroduced once more as the Marshal of the Russian Federation (Russian: Маршал Российской Федерации).

<text>The red-naped sapsucker (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) is a medium-sized North American woodpecker. Long thought to be a subspecies of the yellow-bellied sapsucker, it is now known to be a distinct species.

==Systematics==
The red-naped sapsucker is one of four North American woodpeckers in the genus &quot;Sphyrapicus&quot;. It has no subspecies. First described by Spencer Fullerton Baird in 1858, it was initially thought to be a subspecies of the yellow-bellied sapsucker. However, there are significant genetic differences between this species and the yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union recognized it as a distinct species in the seventh edition of its North American birds checklist, published in 1998. Genetic analysis has shown that the red-naped sapsucker is a sister species with (and very closely related to) the red-breasted sapsucker, and that these two species form a superspecies with the yellow-bellied sapsucker. All three species are known to hybridize with each other, with hybrids between red-naped and red-breasted sapsuckers proving particularly common.

The genus name &quot;Sphyrapicus&quot; is a combination of the Greek words &quot;sphura&quot;, meaning &quot;hammer&quot; and &quot;pikos&quot;, meaning &quot;woodpecker&quot;. The specific name &quot;nuchalis&quot; is a modern Latin word meaning &quot;of the nape&quot;. In its common name, &quot;red-naped&quot;, refers to the red patch on the back of the bird&#x27;s head, while &quot;sapsucker&quot; refers to its distinctive method of feeding.

==Description==
The red-naped sapsucker is a medium-sized woodpecker, measuring long and weighing . Adults have a black head with a red forehead, white stripes, and a red spot on the nape; they have a white lower belly and rump. They have a yellow breast and upper belly. They are black on the back and wings with white bars; they have a large white wing patch. Adult males have a red throat patch; for females, the lower part of the throat is red, the upper part white.
==Habitat and range==
Their breeding habitat is mixed forests in the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin areas of North America. They nest in a cavity in a dead tree. Other species which nest in tree cavities reuse nests formerly used by these birds. 
To provide habitat and foraging for woodpeckers, forest management objectives on public land include snag and live tree retention. Numerous studies have shown woodpeckers will readily nest in logged areas as long as some stands are left standing. The drastic change in forest habitat caused by logging and tree retention drastically effects the quality of nesting sites and is detrimental to the red-naped sapsuckers habitat.

These birds migrate south and vacate areas at higher elevations.

==Behavior==

===Feeding===
True to their name, and like other sapsuckers, they drill holes in trees and eat the sap as well as insects attracted to it. They sometimes catch insects in flight; they also eat seeds and berries.

===Breeding===
Red-naped sapsuckers typically lay 3–7 white eggs. The young are altricial, naked, and helpless. The eggs are incubated for 12–13 days and the young are able to fly and leave the nest 25–29 days after hatching.

Throughout western North America, red-naped sapsucker (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) nests have been described primarily in trembling aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) with decay-softened wood. Heart-wood decay is reported to infect the roots of most aspens that red-naped sapsuckers choose to excavate for nesting. Red-naped sapsuckers typically excavate their first cavity relatively close to the ground and over subsequent years make progressively higher excavations. Most (68%) nest trees were live and 75% had broken tops. Western larch (Larix occidentalis) and birch were greatly over utilized compared to their availability.

<text>Philippa of Lancaster ( ; 31 March 1360 – 19 July 1415) was Queen of Portugal from 1387 until 1415 as the wife of King John I. Born into the royal family of England, her marriage secured the Treaty of Windsor and produced several children who became known as the &quot;Illustrious Generation&quot; in Portugal. She was the only Queen of Portugal of English origin.

== Early life and education ==

Born on 31 March 1360, Philippa was the eldest child of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and Blanche of Lancaster. Philippa spent her infancy moving around the various properties owned by her family with her mother and her wet-nurse, Maud. Here, she was raised and educated alongside her two younger siblings, Elizabeth, who was three years younger, and Henry, seven years younger, who would later become King Henry IV. Philippa&#x27;s mother, Blanche, died in 1368. Her father remarried in 1371 to Infanta Constance of Castile, daughter of King Peter of Castile and on Constance&#x27;s death in 1394, he married his former mistress, Katherine Swynford, who had been Philippa&#x27;s governess. The affair and eventual marriage was considered scandalous, and in the future Philippa would protect herself against such embarrassment.

Katherine seems to have been well liked by Philippa and her Lancastrian siblings and played an important role in Philippa&#x27;s education. Katherine had close ties with Geoffrey Chaucer, since her sister, Philippa Roet, was Chaucer&#x27;s wife. John of Gaunt became Chaucer&#x27;s patron, and Chaucer spent much time with the family as one of Philippa&#x27;s many mentors and teachers. She was remarkably well educated for a woman at the time and studied science under Friar John, poetry under Jean Froissart, and philosophy and theology under John Wycliffe. She was well read in the works of Greek and Roman scholars such as Pliny and Herodotus and was diligent in her study of religion.

==Queen of Portugal ==

Philippa became Queen consort of Portugal through her marriage to King John I. This marriage was the final step in the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance against the Franco-Castillian axis. The couple were blessed by the church in the Cathedral of Porto on 2 February 1387 and their marriage was on 14 February 1387. The Portuguese court celebrated the union for fifteen days. Philippa married King John I by proxy, and in keeping with a unique Portuguese tradition, the stand-in bridegroom pretended to bed the bride. The stand-in for King John I was João Rodrigues de Sá.

The marriage itself, as was usually the case for the nobility in the Middle Ages, was a matter of state and political alliance, and the couple did not meet until twelve days after they were legally married. Philippa was considered to be rather plain, and King João I (John I) already had a mistress, Inês Peres Esteves, by whom he had three children. Their son Afonso was ten when Philippa and John married. Philippa allowed Afonso and his sister Beatrice to be raised in the Portuguese court (the third child, Branca, died in infancy). Their mother left the court at Philippa&#x27;s command to live in a convent, and under Philippa&#x27;s patronage, she became the Prioress.

In marrying Philippa, John I established a political and personal alliance with John of Gaunt, initially because it was rumoured that John of Gaunt would claim the Kingdom of Castile through Catherine of Lancaster, his daughter by his second wife Constance of Castile. As the &quot;de facto King of Castile,&quot; it was feared that John of Gaunt could challenge King John&#x27;s claim to the newly installed dynasty. Instead, at Windsor in 1386, John I of Portugal signed the remarkably long-lasting Portuguese–English Alliance, which continued through the Napoleonic Wars and ensured Portugal&#x27;s tenuous neutrality in World War II. 

Philippa, at the age of 27, was thought to be too old to become a bride for the first time, and the court questioned her ability to bear the King&#x27;s children; however, Philippa bore nine children, six of whom survived into adulthood.

=== Influence at court ===
Though Philippa was seen to present a demeanour of queenly piety, commenting that &quot;it would be regarded as an indecent thing for a wife to interfere in her husband&#x27;s affairs&quot;, she wielded significant influence in both the Portuguese and English courts and was &quot;actively involved in world affairs&quot;. Surviving letters show that Philippa often wrote to the English court from Portugal and stayed involved in English politics. In one instance, Philippa intervened in court politics on &quot;behalf of followers of the dethroned Richard II when they appealed for her help after her brother, Henry IV, had usurped the English throne&quot;. On another occasion, she persuaded the reluctant Earl of Arundel to marry her husband&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Beatrice, further cementing the alliance between Portugal and England.

Philippa&#x27;s main political contribution, however, was in her own court. Upon the end of the Portuguese involvement in several wars with Castile and the Moors, the Portuguese economy was failing, and many soldiers now unemployed. Philippa knew that the conquest and control of Ceuta would be quite lucrative for Portugal with the control of the African and Indian spice trade. Though Philippa died before her plan was realised, Portugal did send an expedition to conquer the city, a goal that was realised on 14 August 1415 in the Conquest of Ceuta.

=== Death ===

At the age of 55, Philippa fell ill with the plague. She moved from Lisbon to Sacavém and called her sons to her bedside so that she could give them her blessing. Philippa presented her three eldest sons with jewel-encrusted swords, which they would use in their impending knighthoods, and gave each a portion of the True Cross, &quot;enjoining them to preserve their faith and to fulfil the duties of their rank&quot;.

Though he had been reluctant to marry her, the king had grown quite fond of his wife, and it is said that he was &quot;so grieved by [her] mortal illness… that he could neither eat nor sleep&quot;. In her final hours, Philippa was said to be lucid and without pain. According to legend she was roused by a wind which blew strongly against the house and asked what wind it was, upon hearing it was the north wind, she claimed it quite beneficial for her son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s voyage to Africa, which she had coordinated. At her death she prayed with several priests and, &quot;without any toil or suffering, gave her soul into the hands of Him who created her, a smile appearing on her mouth as though she disdained the life of this world&quot;.

== Children ==

Philippa was apparently a generous and loving queen, the mother of the &quot;Illustrious Generation&quot; (in Portuguese, &quot;Ínclita Geração&quot;) of &quot;infantes&quot; (princes) and &quot;infantas&quot; (princesses). Her children were:

* Blanche (13 July 1388 – 6 March 1389), died in infancy at the age of 7 months, in Lisbon, and was buried in Lisbon Cathedral
* Afonso (30 July 1390 – 22 December 1400), heir to the throne, died in childhood at the age of 10, in Braga, and was buried in Lisbon Cathedral
* Edward (31 October 1391 – 13 September 1438), a writer and an intellectual who succeeded his father as King of Portugal in 1433.
* Peter (9 December 1392 – 20 May 1449), Duke of Coimbra, a well-travelled man who served as regent during the minority of his nephew Afonso V.
* Henry (4 March 1394 – 13 November 1460), called &quot;the Navigator&quot;, first Duke of Viseu, who guided Portugal to the Age of Discovery.
* Isabella (21 February 1397 – 11 December 1471), married Philip III of Burgundy.
* John (13 January 1400 – 18 October 1442), Constable of Portugal, Lord of Reguengos, grandfather of two 16th-century Iberian monarchs (Manuel I of Portugal and Isabella I of Castile).
* Ferdinand (29 September 1402 – 5 June 1443), called &quot;the Saint Prince&quot;, a warrior who was captured during the Disaster of Tangier in 1437 and died a prisoner of the Moors.

== Legacy ==

Philippa and King John&#x27;s union was praised for establishing purity and virtue in a court that was regarded as particularly corrupt. Philippa is remembered as the mother of &quot;The Illustrious Generation&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Ínclita Geração&quot;). Her surviving children went on to make historically significant contributions in their own right. Edward became the eleventh King of Portugal, and was known as, &quot;The Philosopher,&quot; or the &quot;Eloquent&quot;. Henry the Navigator sponsored expeditions to Africa.

Philippa&#x27;s influence was documented in literary works. The medieval French poet Eustache Deschamps dedicated one of his ballads to &quot;Phelippe en Lancastre,&quot; as a partisan of the Order of the Flower. It has also been speculated that Geoffrey Chaucer may have alluded to Philippa in his poem, &quot;The Legend of Good Women,&quot; through the character Alceste.

<doc id="355273" wikidata="Q312503" url="?curid=355273" title="John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury">
<text>John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury (30 April 1834 – 28 May 1913), known as Sir John Lubbock, 4th Baronet, from 1865 until 1900, was an English banker, Liberal politician, philanthropist, scientist and polymath. Lubbock worked in his family company as a banker but made significant contributions in archaeology, ethnography, and several branches of biology. He coined the terms &quot;Palaeolithic&quot; and &quot;Neolithic&quot; to denote the Old and New Stone Ages, respectively. He helped establish archaeology as a scientific discipline, and was influential in debates concerning evolutionary theory. He introduced the first law for the protection of the UK&#x27;s archaeological and architectural heritage. He promoted the establishment of public libraries and was also a founding member of the X Club.

== Early life ==
John Lubbock was born in 1834, the son of Sir John Lubbock, 3rd Baronet, a London banker, and his wife Harriet. He was brought up in the family home of High Elms Estate, near Downe in Kent. The family had two homes, one at 29 Eaton Place, Belgrave Square where John was born, and another in Mitcham Grove. Lubbock senior had studied mathematics at Cambridge University and had written on probability, and on astronomy. A Fellow of the Royal Society, he was keenly involved in the scientific debates of the time, as well as serving as the Vice Chancellor of London University. During 1842, his father brought home a &quot;great piece of news&quot;: the young Lubbock said later that he initially thought that the news might be of a new pony, and was disappointed to learn it was only that Charles Darwin was moving to Down House in the village. The youth was soon a frequent visitor to Down House, and became the closest of Darwin&#x27;s younger friends. Their relationship stimulated young Lubbock&#x27;s passion for science and evolutionary theory. John&#x27;s mother, Harriet, was deeply religious.

In 1845, Lubbock began studies at Eton College. After finishing school, he was employed by his father&#x27;s bank, Lubbock &amp; Co. (which later amalgamated with Coutts &amp; Co.), of which he became a partner at the age of 22. Around 1852, he assisted Darwin&#x27;s research by examining and illustrating barnacles. In 1865, he succeeded to the baronetcy.

== Business and politics ==
In the early 1870s, Lubbock became increasingly interested in politics. In 1870, and again in 1874, he was elected as a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidstone. He lost the seat at the election of 1880, but was at once elected member for London University, of which he had been vice-chancellor since 1872. As an MP, Lubbock had a distinguished political career, with four main political agendas: promotion of the study of science in primary and secondary schools; the national debt, free trade, and related economic issues; protection of ancient monuments; securing of additional holidays and shorter working hours for the working classes. He was successful with numerous enactments in Parliament, including the Bank Holidays Act 1871 and the Ancient Monuments Act 1882, along with another 28 acts of Parliament. When the Liberals split in 1886 on the issue of Irish Home Rule, Lubbock joined the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party in opposition to Irish home rule. A prominent supporter of the Statistical Society, he took an active part in criticizing the encroachment of municipal trading and the increase of the municipal debt.

Lubbock&#x27;s thoughts about the nature and value of politics were deeply influenced by his scientific research, particularly his writings on early human society. He believed that the cognitive foundations of morality could be shaped through political economy, particularly through a national education system that implemented subjects mandated by the state. He held that the minds of children could be shaped in the direction of democracy, liberalism and morality through learning how to read and write. To this goal he was a strong supporter of the Elementary Education Act 1870 and he defended the introduction of the national curriculum during the 1870s and 1880s.

In 1879, Lubbock was elected the first president of the Institute of Bankers. In 1881, he was president of the British Association, and from 1881 to 1886, president of the Linnean Society of London. In March 1883, he founded the Bank Clerks Orphanage, which in 1986 became the Bankers&#x27; Benevolent Fund – a charity for bank employees, past and present, and their dependants. 

In January 1884, he helped found the Proportional Representation League, later to become the Electoral Reform Society. He authored the pamphlet &quot;Proportional Representation&quot; shortly after the founding of this organization. He is credited with the now-common use of multi-member districts instead of country-wide districting proposed by Thomas Hare in his 1859 single transferable voting (STV) proposal.

In recognition of his contributions to the sciences, Lubbock received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge (where he was Rede lecturer in 1886), Edinburgh, Dublin and Würzburg; and was appointed a trustee of the British Museum in 1878. He received the German Order Pour le Mérite for Science and Arts in August 1902.

From 1888 to 1892, he was president of the London Chamber of Commerce, and he was later President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom. In local politics, he was from 1889 to 1890 vice-chairman and from 1890 to 1892 chairman of the London County Council. In February 1890 he was appointed a privy councillor; and was chairman of the committee of design for the new coinage in 1891. On 22 January 1900, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Avebury, of Avebury, in the county of Wiltshire, his title commemorating the largest Stone Age site in Britain, which he had helped to preserve. He was President of the Royal Statistical Society from 1900 to 1902.

In November 1905, together with Lord Courtney of Penwith, he founded the Anglo-German Friendship Committee which sought to counteract the influence of the British war party, whose anti-German propaganda was then at its zenith, and smooth the way towards more amicable relations between England and Germany.

Lubbock was a proponent of easy access for all to books and was deeply involved in the passing of the &quot;Public Libraries Act&quot;, 1892. The quotation, &quot;We may sit in our library and yet be in all quarters of the earth&quot;, is often attributed to Lubbock. This variation appears in his book &quot;The Pleasures of Life&quot;.

== Archaeology and biological science ==
In addition to his work at his father&#x27;s bank, Lubbock took a keen interest in archaeology and evolutionary theory. In 1855, he and Charles Kingsley discovered the skull of a musk ox in a gravel pit, a discovery that was commended by Darwin. A collection of Iron Age antiquities Lubbock and Sir John Evans excavated at the site of Hallstatt in Austria is now in the British Museum&#x27;s collection. He spoke in support of the evolutionist Thomas Henry Huxley at the famous 1860 Oxford evolution debate. During the 1860s, he published many articles in which he used archaeological evidence to support Darwin&#x27;s theory. In 1864, he became one of the founding members (along with Thomas Henry Huxley and others) of the elite X Club, a dining club composed of nine gentlemen to promote the theories of natural selection and academic liberalism. He held a number of influential academic positions, including President of the Ethnological Society from 1864 to 1865, vice-president of Linnean Society in 1865, and President of the International Congress of Prehistoric Archaeology in 1868. In 1865 he published &quot;Pre-Historic Times&quot;, which became a standard archaeology textbook for the remainder of the century, with the seventh and final edition published in 1913.

His second book, &quot;On the Origin of Civilization&quot;, was published in 1870. He held the position of President of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland from 1871 to 1872, as well as the position of Vice President of the Royal Society in 1871. During this period he worked with John Evans, the other key figure in the establishment of the discipline of archaeology. He invented the terms &quot;Palaeolithic&quot; and &quot;Neolithic&quot; to denote the Old and New Stone Ages, respectively. He also introduced a Darwinian-type theory of human nature and development. &quot;What was new was Lubbock&#x27;s ... insistence that, as a result of natural selection, human groups had become different from each other, not only culturally, but also in their biological capacities to utilize culture.&quot;

Lubbock complained in the preface to &quot;Pre-Historic Times&quot; about Charles Lyell:
In the 1870s, he bought land at Avebury to prevent part of the ancient stone circle from being built on. This, and other threats to the nation&#x27;s heritage, persuaded him that some legal protection was needed. In 1874, he introduced a parliamentary bill that would identify a list of ancient sites that deserved legal protection. After several later attempts and against some opposition, it was not until 1882 that a much watered down version, The Ancient Monuments Act, came into being. Though restricted to 68 largely prehistoric monuments, it was the forerunner of all later laws governing the UK&#x27;s archaeological and architectural heritage.

Lubbock was also an amateur biologist of some distinction, writing books on hymenoptera (&quot;Ants, Bees and Wasps: a record of observations on the habits of the social hymenoptera.&quot; Kegan Paul, London; New York: Appleton, 1884), on insect sense organs and development, on the intelligence of animals, the first monograph on UK Springtails (&quot;Collembola&quot;) (&quot;Monograph on the Collembola and Thysanura&quot;, Ray Society, London), and on other natural history topics. He discovered that ants were sensitive to light in the near ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum. He also noted that ants used the angle of the sun for orientation. In 1874 he became the first President of the British Beekeepers Association. A verse in &quot;Punch&quot; in 1882 described his activities:

He corresponded extensively with Charles Darwin, who lived nearby at Down House. Lubbock stayed in Downe except for a brief period from 1861 to 1865, when he lived in Chislehurst. Both men were active advocates of English spelling reform, and members of the Spelling Reform Association, precursor to the Simplified Spelling Society. Darwin rented land, originally from Lubbock&#x27;s father, in Sandwalk wood where he performed his daily exercise, and in 1874 agreed with Lubbock to exchange the land for a piece of pasture in Darwin&#x27;s property. When Darwin died in 1882, Lubbock suggested the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey, organising a letter to the dean to arrange this, and was one of the pallbearers.

In May 1884, an article appeared in &quot;Scientific American&quot; describing experiments by Lubbock in the field of human-animal communication.

In 1884, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society and in 1893, a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

He received the 1903 Prestwich Medal from the Geological Society of London.

== Family ==
Lubbock was one of eight brothers and three sisters; three brothers, Alfred, Nevile and Edgar, played first-class cricket for Kent. Edgar and Alfred also played football and played together for Old Etonians in the 1875 FA Cup Final. His nephew, Percy Lubbock, was a prominent man of letters and another nephew was the writer and historian Basil Lubbock.

Lubbock married Ellen Frances Horden in April 1856. Five years after her death, on 17 May 1884 he married Alice Lane Fox, the daughter of Augustus Pitt Rivers . He rebuilt Kingsgate Castle, near Broadstairs in Kent, as his family home, where he died in 1913. He was succeeded by his eldest son, John.

He was buried in St Giles the Abbott Church, in Farnborough, London. Three years later, his remains were disinterred and placed in a family burial ground a few hundred yards from the church, along with the original stone Celtic cross marking his grave. In 1986, Bromley Council, unknown to the Lubbock family, moved the cross back to the main church graveyard.

<text>Mount Assiniboine, also known as Assiniboine Mountain, is a pyramidal peak mountain on the Great Divide, on the British Columbia/Alberta border in Canada.

At , it is the highest peak in the Southern Continental Ranges of the Canadian Rockies. Mount Assiniboine rises nearly above Lake Magog. Because of its resemblance to the Matterhorn in the Alps, it is nicknamed the &quot;Matterhorn of the Rockies&quot;.

Mount Assiniboine was named by George M. Dawson in 1885. When Dawson saw Mount Assiniboine from Copper Mountain, he saw a plume of clouds trailing away from the top. This reminded him of the plumes of smoke emanating from the teepees of the Assiniboine people.

Mount Assiniboine lies on the border between Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park, in British Columbia, and Banff National Park, in Alberta. The mountain can be reached only by a six-hour hike or horse-pack , three-hour bike ride (now disallowed to reduce human / grizzly encounters) or helicopter.

== Climbing ==
Mt. Assiniboine was first climbed in the summer of 1901 by James Outram, Christian Bohren and Christian Hasler. In 1925, Lawrence Grassi became the first person to make a solo ascent. On August 27, 2001, Bohren&#x27;s granddaughter Lonnie along with three others made a successful ascent, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the first ascent.

There are no scrambling routes up Mt. Assiniboine. The easiest mountaineering routes are the North Ridge and North Face at YDS 5.5 which are reached from the Hind Hut.

<doc id="355276" wikidata="Q568443" url="?curid=355276" title="Sir John Lubbock, 3rd Baronet">
<text>Sir John William Lubbock, 3rd Baronet, FRS (26 March 1803 – 21 June 1865), was an English banker, barrister, mathematician and astronomer.

==Life==
He was born in Westminster, the son of Sir John William Lubbock, of the Lubbock &amp; Co bank. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1825. In the same year he became a partner in his father&#x27;s bank.

In 1828, he became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society; in 1829, a fellow of the Royal Society, and has been described as &quot;foremost among English mathematicians in adopting Laplace&#x27;s doctrine of probability.&quot; He joined the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge in 1829, and was twice Treasurer (1830–1835, 1838–1845) and three times Vice-President (1830–1835, 1836–1837, 1838–1846) of the Royal Society. 

Lubbock carried out important studies of the tides in the 1830s. He was one of the first to present maps showing lines joining points where high tide occurred at the same time, and coined the term cotidal lines for them. For these studies he was awarded the Royal Medal in 1834.

Lubbock was the first Vice-Chancellor of the University of London (1837–1842), a position later held by his eldest son, Sir John Lubbock, 4th Bt, who was later created Baron Avebury in 1900. He was appointed Sheriff of Kent for 1852.

Lubbock became head of Lubbock &amp; Co, retired mostly in 1840, but oversaw the merger that created Robarts, Lubbock &amp; Co in 1860.

==High Elms==
He largely rebuilt the family home of High Elms, near Downe village in Kent. His property was on the other side of the village to the land belonging to Down House, and when Charles Darwin and Emma Darwin were house-hunting in 1842, Darwin told his sister all about Down House, noting that Lubbock was the owner of and was building a grand house nearby. Darwin said: &quot;I believe he is very reserved &amp; shy &amp; proud or fine—so I suspect he will be no catch, &amp; will never honour us&quot;. When word reached Sir John William Lubbock, he went home and hinted at a great piece of news without immediately disclosing what it was. His son, John, wondered whether the news might be the announcement of a pony of his own, and was disappointed at first to learn that it was merely the news that Charles Darwin would soon be living at Down House. The families were on friendly terms, and young John Lubbock frequently visited Down House, becoming a close friend of Darwin&#x27;s. In 1846, Lubbock rented land near Down House to Darwin, who had it planted as woodland and laid out with the Sandwalk which became Darwin&#x27;s daily walk.

==Family==
He married Harriet Hotham in 1833, and they had eleven children.

Their eldest son John was a scientist and banker, later ennobled as Baron Avebury.

Their youngest child, Edgar, won the FA Cup with Wanderers in 1872 and with Old Etonians in 1879. He was also a cricketer with Kent County Cricket Club.

Another son, Alfred, played for Old Etonians in the 1875 FA Cup Final and was a Kent county cricketer, as was a third son, Nevile. A grandson was the author Basil Lubbock.

<doc id="355279" wikidata="Q2315216" url="?curid=355279" title="Centrul Civic">
<text>Centrul Civic (; &quot;the Civic Centre&quot;) is a district in central Bucharest, Romania, which was completely rebuilt in the 1980s as part of the scheme of systematization under the dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, which included the construction of new civic centres in the Romanian cities. Bucharest Civic Centre was planned to become the new political-administrative center of Communist Romania.

==History==
Bucharest suffered significant damage due to Allied bombing during World War II and the devastating earthquake of March 4, 1977. However, neither of these events changed the face of the city more than the Ceaușescan &quot;redevelopment schemes&quot; of the 1980s, under which an overall area of of the historic center of Bucharest was affected, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted Art Deco sports stadium (Stadionul Republicii). This also involved evicting 40,000 people after a single day&#x27;s notice and relocating them to new homes, in order to make way for the grandiose Centrul Civic and the House of the Republic, now officially renamed as the Palace of the Parliament.

Prior to starting to demolish the old historical town of Bucharest in order to build Centrul Civic, Bucharest (and other cities and towns throughout the country) had already undergone Communist reconstruction, particularly in the 1970s, under the systematization programme which consisted of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to make place to standardized blocks of flats (&quot;blocuri&quot;), as a result of increasing urbanization following an accelerated industrialization process. The construction of Centrul Civic and the demolitions necessary for it, however, were quite extreme even compared to other reconstruction communist programmes. 

The vast empty fields which emerged in the historic town during the demolitions of the 1980s were sarcastically called &quot;Ceaușima&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;Ceaușescu&quot; and &quot;Hiroshima&quot;). Concrete hulks of half-completed buildings (such as the new National Library of Romania) long stood where historic buildings (including most of the city&#x27;s historic Jewish quarter) once stood. A remainder of the former &quot;Ceaușima&quot; is the never-completed eastern large area between the Mircea Vodă Boulevard and Nerva Traian Street (), where in 1989 had begun the construction of the National Centre for Creation and Culture, named after Cântarea României, an ensemble that would include seven performance halls, the first six with capacities between 550 and 2,100 seats, and the seventh, dedicated to the National Opera, of 3,100 seats.
Centrul Civic is surrounded all-around by old historical buildings and neighborhoods (Lipscani street in particular is a famous old-fashioned street). Many churches, such as the Mihai Vodă Monastery, were moved rather than demolished, and the nearby Antim Monastery remains largely intact, although lacking its original eastern wing. Immediately next to Piața Unirii (the Union Square) is Dealul Mitropoliei (the Metropolitan Hill), with the Patriarchal Cathedral and Palace, the seat of the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church.

==Description==
Centrul Civic is a complex of modern concrete buildings with marble façades, centered on a main boulevard originally meant to be Bulevardul Victoria Socialismului (the Victory of Socialism Boulevard). Being renamed, after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, in Bulevardul Unirii (the Union Boulevard), it has been modeled after Paris&#x27;s Champs-Élysées, though a little wider; it runs roughly east–west, making a grand approach to the Palace of the Parliament at its western terminus. A large balcony in the Palace surveys the entire length of the boulevard. Other streets included in the perimeter of Centrul Civic are, among others, Libertății (Liberty) Boulevard, Decebal Boulevard, Burebista Boulevard (unfinished), United Nations (Națiunile Unite) Boulevard, Octavian Goga Boulevard, Mircea Vodă Boulevard (partially), Nerva Traian Street (partially), Izvor Street, or Calea 13 Septembrie (partially).

Centrul Civic includes numerous public offices and apartments, the latter roughly equalling the housing units destroyed for its construction. The apartments were originally intended to house Romania&#x27;s communist elite. In the Union Square, the boulevard bisects the Dâmbovița river, which is channelled at this point underground the Square.

With its architectural uniformity, Centrul Civic stands out as a Socialist Realism style monument. Due to the lack of attractiveness for the commercial spaces located on the ground floor of the respective buildings, as a result of the relatively low pedestrian traffic in the area, most of the small shops and restaurants that form the heart of Bucharest are to be found in the areas immediately to the north of Centrul Civic, in Bucharest Old Town.

<text>Dali City (, Bai: or ) is the county-level seat of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in northwestern Yunnan. Dali City is administered through 12 township-level districts, two of which are also commonly referred to as Dali.

Xiaguan () is the modern city centre and usually conflated with Dali City by virtue of being its seat. This town is the destination of most long-distance transportation heading to Dali and is sometimes referred to as Dali New Town () to avoid confusion.

Dali Town (), formerly known as Tali, is another division of Dali City, located north of Xiaguan. This town, commonly referred to as Dali Old Town () to distinguish it from the city seat in Xiaguan, is usually the Dali referred to in tourist publications. The old town is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Yunnan, known for its natural scenery, historical and cultural heritage, and vibrant nightlife.

==Geography==
Dali City is located in western Yunnan, approximately northwest of the provincial capital of Kunming.

Dali is situated in the transition area between the dramatic valleys of the Hengduan ranges on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau and the distinctive mountains of the western Yungui Plateau. The county-level city surrounds Erhai Lake between the Cang Mountains to the west and Mount Jizu to the east. The county seat at Xiaguan is located at the outlet of the lake into the Yangbi River. Dali Old Town is situated on a fertile plain between the Cang Range and Erhai. This plain has traditionally been settled by the Bai and Yi minorities.

==Climate==
Its low latitude tempered by its high elevation, Dali has a mild subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;) with short, mild, dry winters and warm, rainy summers. Frost may occur in winter but the days still generally warm up to or more. During summer, a majority of the days features some rainfall and daytime temperatures rise to . A great majority of the year&#x27;s rainfall occurs from June to October. December 2013 was particularly marked for its high snowfall.

==Administrative divisions==


Dali City has 3 subdistricts, 9 towns and 1 ethnic township.
;3 subdistricts

;Former : Qiliqiao Town ()

==History==

The Dali area was formerly known as Xiemie (). The old town was the medieval capital of both the Bai kingdom Nanzhao (779–902) and the Kingdom of Dali (937–1253). That city was razed and its records burnt during its conquest by China&#x27;s Yuan Dynasty. The present old town was organized in the late 14th century under the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming Dynasty. The area became significantly Muslim (Hui) under the Yuan and Ming and was the center of the Panthay Rebellion against the Qing from 1856 to 1863. It was severely damaged during a massive earthquake in 1925.

Rail and then air transport have permitted the area (particularly Dali Old Town) to become accessible to tourists in the 20th century. It is now one of China&#x27;s official tourist cities and, along with nearby Lijiang, one of the most popular towns. In order to preserve the appeal of the old town, industrial development is restricted to newer townships such as Xiaguan. Building codes mandate that new construction in the old town and surrounding countryside must conform to the traditional Chinese style, with tiled roofs and bricks, plaster, or white-washed walls.

==Economy==
Much of the local economy now revolves around tourism and services catering to travelers.

Historically, Dali was able to control some of the trade between India and China and independently famed for the woodworkers of the town of Xizhou and for its high-quality marble, used both for construction and decorative objects. It was so prominent in the latter that the modern Chinese word for marble is literally &quot;Dali stone&quot; ().

There is also local tea.

==Culture==
* Third Month Fair (Sanyue Jie)

==Transportation==
===Local transport===
Local transport includes buses, taxis, bicycles, and boats on Erhai Lake. Local busses 4 &amp; 8 provide service from Xiaguan to the old town (1 hr). Tourists often rent bicycles from one of the many rental stores in the old town and explore the region by bike, for instance on a special bike trail around the Erhai lake.

===Air===
Dali Fengyi Airport (DLU) is a domestic airport about east of Xiaguan on Weishan or Airport Rd. Taxis run about 60 RMB to Xiaguan or 90 RMB to the old town. It services (as of 2014) Kunming (20 min), Xishuangbanna (25 min), Chongqing (70 min), Chengdu Shuangliu (80 min), Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Guiyuan.

===Road===
Dali (i.e., Xiaguan) is connected to Kunming and points east by the Hangrui Expressway (G56), which also runs west to Ruili on the Burmese border. The Dali Expressway (G56₁₁) is a spur connecting it with Lijiang. The road to the old town is China National Highway 214, which connects to the expressway to Lijiang north of the lake. It also runs south from Xiaguan to Menghai near the Burmese border.

Long-distance busses run from the old town&#x27;s west gate to Kunming (about 4½ hrs), Lijiang, and Shangri-La. Every Monday, service is also available to Shaping for its market.

Long-distance busses run from Xiaguan&#x27;s stations on Jianshe Road.

===Rail===
Dali has its own railway station with daily services to Kunming and Lijiang. Service to Kunming used to consist of one train during the day and two trains running overnight, with sleeper cars. Per July 2018 Dali is connected to Kunming with a modern high-speed train link with a frequency of one train per hour. As the railway network expands in Yunnan, train service will become available to Shangri-La County and Ruili in the future.

The standard gauge line from Kunming, China to Kyaukphyu port opened in 2021, with a station at Dali.

==Tourism==

Dali is one of Yunnan&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations. Sights include:

* Dali Municipal Museum (): This centrally located museum houses permanent exhibitions on archaeological findings from the region, on paintings and on Buddhist sculptures.
* Three Pagodas and Chongsheng Temple
* Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils film city
* Xizhou: a historical town famed for its architecture and woodwork
* Shuang lang: on the east side of the lake, once a small fishing village, now a rather high-class tourist destination, most buildings and businesses having overtaken the village since 2012. The coast is now completely built up by tourism estates.
* Cang Mountain, west of the Old City and the Three Pagodas
* Stele in memory of Kublai Khan&#x27;s conquest of Yunnan (), erected on top of a large stone tortoise in Sanyue Lane () at the foot of the Cang Mountain, west of the Old City.

<doc id="355288" wikidata="Q208454" url="?curid=355288" title="Abacus (architecture)">
<text>In architecture, an abacus (from the Ancient Greek (), ; or French , ; : abacuses or abaci) is a flat slab forming the uppermost member or division of the capital of a column, above the bell. Its chief function is to provide a large supporting surface, tending to be wider than the capital, as an abutment to receive the weight of the arch or the architrave above. The diminutive of abacus, abaculus, is used to describe small mosaic tiles, also called abaciscus or [[tessera]], used to create ornamental floors with detailed patterns of chequers or squares in a tessellated pavement.

== Definition ==
In classical architecture, the shape of the abacus and its edge profile varies in the different classical orders. In the Greek Doric order, the abacus is a plain square slab without mouldings, supported on an echinus. In the Roman and Renaissance Doric orders, it is crowned by a moulding (known as &quot;crown moulding&quot;). In the Tuscan and Roman Doric capital, it may rest on a boltel.

In the archaic Greek Ionic order, owing to the greater width of the capital, the abacus is rectangular in plan, and consists of a carved ovolo moulding. In later examples, the slab is thinner and the abacus remains square, except where there are angled volutes, where the slab is slightly curved. In the Roman and Renaissance Ionic capital, the abacus is square with a fillet on the top of an ogee moulding with curved edges over angled volutes.
In an angular capital of the Greek Corinthian order, the abacus is moulded, its sides are concave, and its angles canted (except in one or two exceptional Greek capitals, where it is brought to a sharp angle); the volutes of adjacent faces meet and project diagonally under each corner of the abacus. The same shape is adopted in the Roman and Renaissance Corinthian and Composite capitals, in some cases with the carved ovolo moulding, fillet, and .

In Romanesque architecture, the abacus survives as a heavier slab, generally moulded and decorated. It is often square with the lower edge splayed off and moulded or carved, and the same was retained in France during the medieval period; but in England, in Early English work, a circular deeply moulded abacus was introduced, which in the 14th and 15th centuries was transformed into an octagonal one.

In Gothic architecture, the moulded forms of the abacus vary in shape, such as square, circular, or even octagonal, it may even be a flat disk or drum. The form of the Gothic abacus is often affected by the shape of a vault that springs from the column, in which case it is called an impost block.

== Indian architecture (&quot;śilpaśāstra&quot;) ==

In &quot;śilpaśāstra&quot;, the ancient Indian science of sculpture, the abacus is commonly termed as &quot;phalaka&quot; (or &quot;phalakā&quot;). It consists of a flat plate and forms part of the standard pillar (stambha). The &quot;phalaka&quot; should be constructed below the &quot;potikā&quot; (&quot;bracket&quot;). It is commonly found together with the dish-like maṇḍi as a single unit. The term is found in encyclopedic books such as the &quot;Mānasāra&quot;, &quot;Kāmikgāgama&quot; and the &quot;Suprabhedāgama&quot;.

==Examples in England==
Early Saxon abaci are frequently simply , but sometimes grooved as in the crypt at Repton (fig. 1) and in the arcade of the refectory at Westminster Abbey. The abacus in Norman work is square where the columns are small; but on larger piers it is sometimes octagonal, as at Waltham Abbey. The square of the abacus is often sculptured with ornaments, as at the White Tower and at Alton, Hampshire (fig. 2). In Early English work, the abacus is generally circular, and in larger work, a group of circles (fig. 4), with some examples of octagonal and square shapes. The mouldings are generally half-rounds, which overhang deep hollows in the capital. In France, the abacus in early work is generally square, as at Chateau de Blois (fig. 3).
==Examples in France==
The first abacus pictured below (fig. 5) is decorated with simple mouldings and ornaments, common during the 12th century, in Île-de-France, Normandy, Champagne, and Burgundy regions, and from the choir of Vézelay Abbey (fig. 6). Figure 7 shows a circular abacus used at windows in the side chapels of Notre Dame de Paris. Towards the end of the 13th century, this element decreases in importance—they became short with a narrow profile during the 14th century, and disappeared almost entirely during the 15th century (fig. 8).

<text>Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. The concept exists in both natural language and programming languages though in different forms. In natural language, the readability of text depends on its content (the complexity of its vocabulary and syntax) and its presentation (such as typographic aspects that affect legibility, like font size, line height, character spacing, and line length). In programming, things such as programmer comments, choice of loop structure, and choice of names can determine the ease with which humans can read computer program code.

Higher readability in a text eases reading effort and speed for the general population of readers. For those who do not have high reading comprehension, readability is necessary for understanding and applying a given text. Techniques to simplify readability are essential to communicate a set of information to the intended audience. Whether it is code, news information, or storytelling, every writer has a target audience that they have to adjust their readability levels to.

== Definition ==
The term &quot;readability&quot; is inherently broad and can become confusing when examining all of the possible definitions. Readability is a concept that involves audience, content, quality, legibility, and can even involve the formatting and design structure of any given text. Different definitions of readability exist from various sources. The definition fluctuates based on the type of audience to whom one is presenting a certain type of content. For example, a technical writer might focus on clear and concise language and formatting that allows easy-reading. In contrast, a scholarly journal would use sophisticated writing that would appeal and make sense to the type of audience to whom they are directing information.

== Applications ==
Readability is essential to the clarity and accessibility of texts used in classrooms, work environments, and everyday life. The government prioritizes readability as well through Plain Language Laws which enforces important documents to be written at an 8th grade level.

Much research has focused on matching prose to reading skill, resulting in formulas for use in research, government, teaching, publishing, the military, medicine, and business.

The two publications with the largest circulations, &quot;TV Guide&quot; (13 million) and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; (12 million), are written at the 9th-grade level. The most popular novels are written at the 7th-grade level. This supports the fact that the average adult reads at the 9th-grade level. It also shows that, for recreation, people read texts that are two grades below their actual reading level.

== History ==

===Early research===
For centuries, teachers and educators have seen the importance of organization, coherence, and emphasis in good writing. In the 1880s, English professor L. A. Sherman found that the English sentence was getting shorter. In Elizabethan times, the average sentence was 50 words long while in Sherman&#x27;s modern time, it was 23 words long.

Sherman&#x27;s work established that:

* Literature is a subject for statistical analysis.
* Shorter sentences and concrete terms help people to make sense of what is written.
* Speech is easier to understand than text.
* Over time, text becomes easier if it is more like speech.

Sherman wrote: &quot;No man should talk worse than he writes, no man should write better than he should talk...&quot; He wrote this wanting to emphasize that the closer writing is to speech, the more clear and effective the content becomes.

In 1889 in Russia, the writer Nikolai A. Rubakin published a study of over 10,000 texts written by everyday people. From these texts, he took 1,500 words he thought most people understood. He found that the main blocks to comprehension are &quot;unfamiliar words&quot; and &quot;long sentences&quot;. Starting with his own journal at the age of 13, Rubakin published many articles and books on science and many subjects for the great numbers of new readers throughout Russia. In Rubakin&#x27;s view, the people were not fools. They were simply poor and in need of cheap books, written at a level they could grasp.

=== Reading ease ===

The earliest reading ease assessment is the subjective judgment termed text leveling. Formulas do not fully address the various content, purpose, design, visual input, and organization of a text. Text leveling is commonly used to rank the reading ease of texts in areas where reading difficulties are easy to identify, such as books for young children. At higher levels, ranking reading ease becomes more difficult, as individual difficulties become harder to identify. This has led to better ways to assess reading ease.

In the 1920s, the scientific movement in education looked for tests to measure students&#x27; achievement to aid in curriculum development. Teachers and educators had long known that, to improve reading skill, readers—especially beginning readers—need reading material that closely matches their ability. University-based psychologists did much of the early research, which was later taken up by textbook publishers. In 1921, Harry D. Kitson published &quot;The Mind of the Buyer&quot;, one of the first books to apply psychology to marketing. Kitson&#x27;s work showed that each type of reader bought and read their own type of text. On reading two newspapers and two magazines, he found that short sentence length and short word length were the best contributors to reading ease.

In 1923, Bertha A. Lively and Sidney L. Pressey published the first reading ease formula. They were concerned that junior high school science textbooks had so many technical words and that teachers would spend all class time explaining these words. They argued that their formula would help to measure and reduce the &quot;vocabulary burden&quot; of textbooks. Their formula used five variable inputs and six constants. For each thousand words, it counted the number of unique words, the number of words not on the Thorndike list, and the median index number of the words found on the list. Manually, it took three hours to apply the formula to a book.

After the Lively–Pressey study, people looked for formulas that were more accurate and easier to apply. In 1928, Carleton Washburne and Mabel Vogel created the first modern readability formula. They validated it by using an outside criterion, and correlated .845 with test scores of students who read and liked the criterion books. It was also the first to introduce the variable of interest to the concept of readability.

Between 1929 and 1939, Alfred Lewerenz of the Los Angeles School District published several new formulas.

In 1934, educational psychologist Edward Thorndike of Columbia University noted that, in Russia and Germany, teachers used word frequency counts to match books to students. Word skill was the best sign of intellectual development, and the strongest predictor of reading ease. In 1921, Thorndike published &quot;Teachers Word Book&quot;, which contained the frequencies of 10,000 words. He also published his readability formula. He wrote that word skills can be increased if the teacher introduces new words and repeats them often. In 1939, W.W. Patty and W. I Painter published a formula for measuring the vocabulary burden of textbooks. This was the last of the early formulas that used the Thorndike vocabulary-frequency list. Until computers came along, word frequency lists were the best aids for grading reading ease of texts.

In 1981 the World Book Encyclopedia listed the grade levels of 44,000 words. A popular strategy amongst educators in modern times is &quot;incidental vocabulary learning,&quot; which enforces efficiency in learning vocabulary in the short-term rather than drilling words and meanings teachers hope will stick. The incidental learning tactic is meant to help learners build comprehension and learning skills rather than memorizing words. Through this strategy, students would hopefully be able to navigate various levels of readability using context clues and comprehension.

===Readability studies===

During the recession of the 1930s, the U.S. government invested in adult education. In 1931, Douglas Waples and Ralph Tyler published &quot;What Adults Want to Read About.&quot; It was a two-year study of adult reading interests. Their book showed not only what people read but what they would like to read. They found that many readers lacked suitable reading materials: they would have liked to learn but the reading materials were too hard for them.

Lyman Bryson of Teachers College, Columbia University found that many adults had poor reading ability due to poor education. Even though colleges had long tried to teach how to write in a clear and readable style, Bryson found that it was rare. He wrote that such language is the result of a &quot;...discipline and artistry that few people who have ideas will take the trouble to achieve... If simple language were easy, many of our problems would have been solved long ago.&quot; Bryson helped set up the Readability Laboratory at the college. Two of his students were Irving Lorge and Rudolf Flesch.

In 1934, Ralph Ojemann investigated adult reading skills, factors that most directly affect reading ease, and causes of each level of difficulty. He did not invent a formula, but a method for assessing the difficulty of materials for parent education. He was the first to assess the validity of this method by using 16 magazine passages tested on actual readers. He evaluated 14 measurable and three reported factors that affect reading ease.

Ojemann emphasized the reported features, such as whether the text was coherent or unduly abstract. He used his 16 passages to compare and judge the reading ease of other texts, a method now called &quot;scaling&quot;. He showed that even though these factors cannot be measured, they cannot be ignored.

Also in 1934, Ralph Tyler and Edgar Dale published the first adult reading ease formula based on passages on health topics from a variety of textbooks and magazines. Of 29 factors that are significant for young readers, they found ten that are significant for adults. They used three of these in their formula.

In 1935, William S. Gray of the University of Chicago and Bernice Leary of Xavier College in Chicago published &quot;What Makes a Book Readable,&quot; one of the most important books in readability research. Like Dale and Tyler, they focused on what makes books readable for adults of limited reading ability. Their book included the first scientific study of the reading skills of American adults. The sample included 1,690 adults from a variety of settings and regions. The test used a number of passages from newspapers, magazines, and books—as well as a standard reading test. They found a mean grade score of 7.81 (eighth month of the seventh grade). About one-third read at the 2nd to 6th-grade level, one-third at the 7th to 12th-grade level, and one-third at the 13th–17th grade level. The authors emphasized that one-half of the adult population at that time lacked suitable reading materials. They wrote, &quot;For them, the enriching values of reading are denied unless materials reflecting adult interests are adapted to their needs.&quot; The poorest readers, one-sixth of the adult population, need &quot;simpler materials for use in promoting functioning literacy and in establishing fundamental reading habits.&quot;

In 1939, Irving Lorge published an article that reported other combinations of variables that indicate difficulty more accurately than the ones Gray and Leary used. His research also showed that, &quot;The vocabulary load is the most important concomitant of difficulty.&quot; In 1944, Lorge published his &quot;Lorge Index&quot;, a readability formula that used three variables and set the stage for simpler and more reliable formulas that followed.

By 1940, investigators had:
* Successfully used statistical methods to analyze reading ease
* Found that unusual words and sentence length were among the first causes of reading difficulty
* Used vocabulary and sentence length in formulas to predict reading ease

===Readership formula adoption===

In 1943, Rudolf Flesch published his PhD dissertation, &quot;Marks of a Readable Style&quot;, which included a readability formula to predict the difficulty of adult reading material. Investigators in many fields began using it to improve communications. One of the variables it used was &quot;personal references,&quot; such as names and personal pronouns. Another variable was &quot;affixes&quot;.

In 1947, Donald Murphy of &quot;Wallace&#x27;s Farmer&quot; used a split-run edition to study the effects of making text easier to read. He found that reducing from the 9th to the 6th-grade reading level increased readership by 43% for an article about &#x27;nylon&#x27;. He also found a 60% increase in readership for an article on corn, with better responses from people under 35. The result was a gain of 42,000 readers in a circulation of 275,000.

Wilber Schramm, who directed the Communications Research program at the University of Illinois interviewed 1,050 newspaper readers in 1947. He found that an easier reading style helps to determine how much of an article is read. This was called reading persistence, depth, or perseverance He also found that people will read less of long articles than of short ones, for example, a story nine paragraphs long will lose 3 out of 10 readers by the fifth paragraph. In contrast, a shorter story will lose only 2 out of 10 readers.

A study in 1947 by Melvin Lostutter showed that newspapers were generally written at a level five years above the ability of average American adult readers. The reading ease of newspaper articles was not found to have much connection with the education, experience, or personal interest of the journalists writing the stories. It instead had more to do with the convention and culture of the industry. Lostutter argued for more readability testing in newspaper writing. Improved readability must be a &quot;conscious process somewhat independent of the education and experience of the staffs &quot;writers.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

In 1948, Flesch published his Reading Ease formula in two parts. Rather than using grade levels, it used a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 equivalent to the 12th grade and 100 equivalent to the 4th grade. It dropped the use of affixes. The second part of the formula predicts human interest by using personal references and the number of personal sentences. The new formula correlated 0.70 with the McCall-Crabbs reading tests.

In 1948, Bernard Feld did a study of every item and ad in the &quot;Birmingham News&quot; of 20 November 1947. He divided the items into those above the 8th-grade level and those at the 8th grade or below. He chose the 8th-grade breakpoint, as that was determined to be the average reading level of adult readers. An 8th-grade text &quot;...will reach about 50% of all American grown-ups,&quot; he wrote. Among the wire-service stories, the lower group got two-thirds more readers, and among local stories, 75% more readers. Feld also believed in drilling writers in Flesch&#x27;s clear-writing principles.

Both Rudolf Flesch and Robert Gunning worked extensively with newspapers and the wire services in improving readability. Mainly through their efforts in a few years, the readability of US newspapers went from the 16th to the 11th-grade level, where it remains today. Publishers discovered that the Flesch formulas could increase readership up to 60%. Flesch&#x27;s work made an enormous impact on journalism. The Flesch Reading Ease formula became one of the most widely used, tested, and reliable readability metrics. In 1951, Farr, Jenkins, and Patterson simplified the formula further by changing the syllable count.

===Formula refinement and variants===

In the 1940s, Robert Gunning helped bring readability research into the workplace. In 1944, he founded the first readability consulting firm dedicated to reducing the &quot;fog&quot; in newspapers and business writing. In 1952, he published &quot;The Technique of Clear Writing&quot; with his own Fog Index, a formula that correlates 0.91 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.

Edgar Dale, a professor of education at Ohio State University, was one of the first critics of Thorndike&#x27;s vocabulary-frequency lists. He claimed that they did not distinguish between the different meanings that many words have. He created two new lists of his own. One, his &quot;short list&quot; of 769 easy words, was used by Irving Lorge in his formula. The other was his &quot;long list&quot; of 3,000 easy words, which were understood by 80% of fourth-grade students. However, one has to extend the word lists by regular plurals of nouns, regular forms of the past tense of verbs, progressive forms of verbs etc. In 1948, he incorporated this list into a formula he developed with Jeanne S. Chall, who later founded the Harvard Reading Laboratory. In 1995, Dale and Chall published a new version of their formula with an upgraded word list, the New Dale–Chall readability formula.

The Spache readability formula was developed in 1952.

In 1963, while teaching English teachers in Uganda, Edward Fry developed his Readability Graph. It became one of the most popular formulas and easiest to apply.

The automated readability index was developed in 1967.

Harry McLaughlin determined that word length and sentence length should be multiplied rather than added as in other formulas. In 1969, he published his SMOG (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook) formula. It is often recommended for use in healthcare.

The Golub Syntactic Density Score was developed by Lester Golub in 1974.

In 1973, a study commissioned by the US military of the reading skills required for different military jobs produced the FORCAST formula. Unlike most other formulas, it uses only a vocabulary element, making it useful for texts without complete sentences. The formula satisfied requirements that it would be:
* Based on Army-job reading materials.
* Suitable for the young adult-male recruits.
* Easy enough for Army clerical personnel to use without special training or equipment.

In 1975, in a project sponsored by the U.S. Navy, the Reading Ease formula was recalculated to give a grade-level score. The new formula is now called the Flesch–Kincaid grade-level formula.

The Linsear Write Raygor readability estimate was developed in 1977.

In 1978, John Bormuth of the University of Chicago looked at reading ease using the new Cloze deletion test developed by Wilson Taylor. His work supported earlier research including the degree of reading ease for each kind of reading. The best level for classroom &quot;assisted reading&quot; is a slightly difficult text that causes a &quot;set to learn&quot;, and for which readers can correctly answer 50% of the questions of a multiple-choice test. The best level for unassisted reading is one for which readers can correctly answer 80% of the questions. These cutoff scores were later confirmed by Vygotsky and Chall and Conard.
Among other things, Bormuth confirmed that vocabulary and sentence length are the best indicators of reading ease. He showed that the measures of reading ease worked as well for adults as for children. The same things that children find hard are the same for adults of the same reading levels. He also developed several new measures of cutoff scores. One of the most well known was the &quot;Mean Cloze Formula&quot;, which was used in 1981 to produce the &quot;Degree of Reading Power&quot; system used by the College Entrance Examination Board.

In 1988, Jack Stenner and his associates at MetaMetrics, Inc. published the Lexile Framework for assessing readability and matching students with appropriate texts. The Lexile framework uses average sentence length, and average word frequency in the American Heritage Intermediate Corpus to predict a score on a 0–2000 scale. The AHI Corpus includes five million words from 1,045 published works often read by students in grades three to nine.

In 2000, researchers of the School Renaissance Institute and Touchstone Applied Science Associates published their Advantage-TASA Open Standard (ATOS) Reading ease Formula for Books. They worked on a formula that was easy to use and that could be used with any texts.

The project was one of the widest reading ease projects ever. The developers of the formula used 650 normed reading texts, 474 million words from all the text in 28,000 books read by students. The project also used the reading records of more than 30,000 who read and were tested on 950,000 books.

They found that three variables give the most reliable measure of text reading ease:

*words per sentence
*average grade level of words
*characters per word

They also found that:

*To help learning, the teacher should match book reading ease with reading skill.
*Reading often helps with reading gains.
*For reading alone below the 4th grade, the best learning gain requires at least 85% comprehension.
*Advanced readers need 92% comprehension for independent reading.
*Book length can be a good measure of reading ease.
*Feedback and interaction with the teacher are the most important factors in reading.

===Measuring coherence and organization===
Beginning in the 1970s, cognitive theorists began teaching that reading is really an act of thinking and organization. The reader constructs meaning by mixing new knowledge into existing knowledge. Because of the limits of the reading ease formulas, some research looked at ways to measure the content, organization, and coherence of text. Although this did not improve the reliability of the formulas, their efforts showed the importance of these variables in reading ease.

Studies by Walter Kintch and others showed the central role of coherence in reading ease, mainly for people learning to read. In 1983, Susan Kemper devised a formula based on physical states and mental states. However, she found this was no better than word familiarity and sentence length in showing reading ease.

Bonnie Meyer and others tried to use organization as a measure of reading ease. While this did not result in a formula, they showed that people read faster and retain more when the text is organized into topics. She found that a visible plan for presenting content greatly helps readers to assess a text. A hierarchical plan shows how the parts of the text are related. It also aids the reader in blending new information into existing knowledge structures.

Bonnie Armbruster found that the most important feature for learning and comprehension is textual coherence, which comes in two types:
*Global coherence, which integrates high-level ideas as themes in an entire section, chapter, or book.
*Local coherence, which joins ideas within and between sentences.

Armbruster confirmed Kintsch&#x27;s finding that coherence and structure are more help for younger readers. R. C. Calfee and R. Curley built on Bonnie Meyer&#x27;s work and found that an unfamiliar underlying structure can make even simple text hard to read. They brought in a graded system to help students progress from simpler story lines to more advanced and abstract ones.

Many other studies looked at the effects on reading ease of other text variables, including:
* Image words, abstraction, direct and indirect statements, types of narration and sentences, phrases, and clauses;
* Difficult concepts;
* Idea density;
* Human interest;
* Nominalization;
* Active and passive voice;
* Embeddedness;
* Structural cues;
* The use of images;
* Diagrams and line graphs;
* Highlighting;
*Fonts and layout;
*Document age.

Coh-Metrix can be used in many different ways to investigate the cohesion of the explicit text and the coherence of the mental representation of the text. &quot;Our definition of cohesion consists of characteristics of the explicit text that play some role in helping the reader mentally connect ideas in the text.&quot; The definition of coherence is the subject of much debate. Theoretically, the coherence of a text is defined by the interaction between linguistic representations and knowledge representations. While coherence can be defined as characteristics of the text (i.e., aspects of cohesion) that are likely to contribute to the coherence of the mental representation, Coh-Metrix measurements provide indices of these cohesion characteristics.

=== Artificial Intelligence ===

Unlike the traditional readability formulas, artificial intelligence approaches to readability assessment (also known as Automatic Readability Assessment) incorporate myriad linguistic features and construct statistical prediction models to predict text readability. These approaches typically consist of three steps: 1. a training corpus of individual texts, 2. a set of linguistic features to be computed from each text, and 3. a machine learning model to predict the readability, using the computed linguistic feature values.

In 2008, it was shown that syntactic complexity is correlated with longer processing times in text comprehension. It is common to use a rich set of these syntactic features to predict the readability of a text. The more advanced variants of syntactic readability features are frequently computed from parse tree. Emily Pitler (University of Pennsylvania) and Ani Nenkova (University of Pennsylvania) are considered pioneers in evaluating the parse-tree syntactic features and making it widely used in readability assessment. Some examples include:
*Average sentence length
*Average parse tree height
*Average number of noun phrases per sentence
*Average number of verb phrases per sentence

Lijun Feng proposed some cognitively-motivated features (mostly lexical) in 2009. This was during her doctorate study at the City University of New York. The cognitively-motivated Although cognitively-motivated features were originally designed to ensure comprehension by adults with intellectual disability, Feng showed such features also improved reading comprehension among the general population. In combination with a logistic regression model, cognitively-motivated features can correct the average error of Flesch–Kincaid grade-level by more than 70%. The newly discovered features by Feng include:
*Number of lexical chains in document
*Average number of unique entities per sentence
*Average number of entity mentions per sentence
*Total number of unique entities in document
*Total number of entity mentions in document
*Average lexical chain length
*Average lexical chain span

In 2012, Sowmya Vajjala at the University of Tübingen created the WeeBit corpus by combining educational articles from the Weekly Reader website and BBC Bitesize website, which provide texts for different age groups. In total, there are 3125 articles that are divided into five readability levels (from age 7 to 16). Weebit corpus has been used in several AI-based readability assessment research.

Wei Xu (University of Pennsylvania), Chris Callison-Burch (University of Pennsylvania), and Courtney Napoles (Johns Hopkins University) introduced the Newsela corpus to the academic field in 2015. The corpus is a collection of thousands of news articles professionally leveled to different reading complexities by professional editors at Newsela. The corpus was originally introduced for text simplification research, but was also used for text readability assessment.

Advanced semantic or semantic features&#x27; influence on text readability was pioneered by Bruce W. Lee during his study at the (University of Pennsylvania), in 2021. Whilst introducing his features hybridization method, he also explored handcrafted advanced semantic features which aim to measure the amount of knowledge contained in a given text.

==Readability formulas==

===Gray and Leary===

Gray and Leary analyzed 228 variables that affect reading ease and divided them into four types: content, style, format, and organization. They found that content was most important, followed closely by style. Third was format, followed closely by organization. They found no way to measure content, format, or organization—but they could measure variables of style. Among the 17 significant measurable style variables, they selected five to create a formula:

* Average sentence length
* Number of different hard words
* Number of personal pronouns
* Percentage of unique words
* Number of prepositional phrases

===Flesch formulas===
The original formula is:

:Reading Ease score = 206.835 − (1.015 × ASL) − (84.6 × ASW)
::Where: ASL = average sentence length (number of words divided by number of sentences)
:: ASW = average word length in syllables (number of syllables divided by number of words)

The modified formula is:

:New reading ease score = 1.599nosw − 1.015sl − 31.517
::Where: nosw = number of one-syllable words per 100 words and
::sl = average sentence length in words.

===Dale–Chall formula===

To apply the formula:

# Select several 100-word samples throughout the text.
# Compute the average sentence length in words (divide the number of words by the number of sentences).
# Compute the percentage of words NOT on the Dale–Chall word list of 3,000 easy words.
# Compute this equation from 1948:
#: Raw score = 0.1579*(PDW) + 0.0496*(ASL) if the percentage of PDW is less than 5%, otherwise compute
#: Raw score = 0.1579*(PDW) + 0.0496*(ASL) + 3.6365

Where:
:Raw score = uncorrected reading grade of a student who can answer one-half of the test questions on a passage.
:PDW = Percentage of difficult words not on the Dale–Chall word list.
:ASL = Average sentence length

Finally, to compensate for the &quot;grade-equivalent curve&quot;, apply the following chart for the Final Score:
The new Dale-Chall formula is:

:Raw score = 64 - 0.95 *(PDW) - 0.69 *(ASL)

===Gunning fog formula===

The Gunning fog formula is one of the most reliable and simplest to apply:

:Grade level= 0.4 * ( (average sentence length) + (percentage of Hard Words) )

:Where: Hard Words = words with more than two syllables.

===Fry readability graph===
===McLaughlin&#x27;s SMOG formula===

:SMOG grading = 3 + .

:Where: polysyllable count = number of words of more than two syllables in a sample of 30 sentences.

===FORCAST formula===

The formula is:

:Grade level = 20 − (&quot;N&quot; / 10)

:Where N = number of single-syllable words in a 150-word sample.

=== Golub Syntactic Density Score ===

The Golub Syntactic Density Score was developed by Lester Golub in 1974. It is among a smaller subset of readability formulas that concentrate on the syntactic features of a text. To calculate the reading level of a text, a sample of several hundred words is taken from the text. The number of words in the sample is counted, as are the number of T-units. A T-unit is defined as an independent clause and any dependent clauses attached to it. Other syntactical units are then counted and entered into the following table:

 1. Words/T-unit .95 X _________ ___
 2. Subordinate clauses/T-unit .90 X _________ ___
 3. Main clause word length (mean) .20 X _________ ___
 4. Subordinate clause length (mean) .50 X _________ ___
 5. Number of Modals (will, shall, can, may, must, would...) .65 X _________ ___
 6. Number of &quot;Be&quot; and &quot;Have&quot; forms in the auxiliary .40 X _________ ___
 7. Number of Prepositional Phrases .75 X _________ ___
 8. Number of Possessive nouns and pronouns .70 X _________ ___
 9. Number of Adverbs of Time (when, then, once, while...) .60 X _________ ___
 10. Number of gerunds, participles, and absolutes Phrases .85 X _________ ___

Users add the numbers in the right hand column and divide the total by the number of T-units. Finally, the quotient is entered into the following table to arrive at a final readability score.

===Lexico-semantic===
The type-token ratio is one of the features that are often used to captures the lexical richness, which is a measure of vocabulary range and diversity. To measure the lexical difficulty of a word, the relative frequency of the word in a representative corpus like the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) is often used. Below includes some examples for lexico-semantic features in readability assessment.
*Average number of syllables per word
*Out-of-vocabulary rate, in comparison to the full corpus
*Type-token ratio: the ratio of unique terms to total terms observed
*Ratio of function words, in comparison to the full corpus
*Ratio of pronouns, in comparison to the full corpus
*Language model perplexity (comparing the text to generic or genre-specific models)

== Readability formula accuracy ==

The correlation with comprehension as measured by reading tests is as follows:

The accuracy of readability formulas increases when finding the average readability of a large number of works. The tests generate a score based on characteristics such as statistical average word length (which is used as an unreliable proxy for semantic difficulty; sometimes word frequency is taken into account) and sentence length (as an unreliable proxy for syntactic complexity) of the work.

Most experts agree that simple readability formulas like Flesch–Kincaid grade-level can be highly misleading. Even though the traditional features like the average sentence length have high correlation with reading difficulty, the measure of readability is much more complex. The artificial intelligence, data-driven approach (see above) was studied to tackle this shortcoming.

Writing experts have warned that an attempt to simplify the text only by changing the length of the words and sentences may result in text that is more difficult to read. All the variables are tightly related. If one is changed, the others must also be adjusted, including approach, voice, person, tone, typography, design, and organization.

Writing for a class of readers other than one&#x27;s own is very difficult. It takes training, method, and practice. Among those who are good at this are writers of novels and children&#x27;s books. The writing experts all advise that, besides using a formula, observe all the norms of good writing, which are essential for writing readable texts. Writers should study the texts used by their audience and their reading habits. This means that for a 5th-grade audience, the writer should study and learn good quality 5th-grade materials.

<text> ( ); is an Irish language sentence which translates as &quot;our day will come&quot;. It is a slogan of Irish republicanism. &quot;Our day&quot; is the date hoped for by Irish nationalists on which a united Ireland is achieved. The slogan was coined in the 1970s during the Troubles in The North of Ireland and variously credited to Bobby Sands or Gerry Adams.

It has been used by Sinn Féin representatives, appeared on graffiti and political murals, and been shouted by IRA defendants being convicted in British and Irish courts, and by their supporters in the public gallery. For Timothy Shanahan, the slogan &quot;captures [a] confident sense of historical destiny&quot;. Derek Lundy comments, &quot;Its meaning is ambiguous. It promises a new day for a hitherto repressed community, but it is also redolent of payback and reprisal.&quot;

Some Irish-language speakers claim that the slogan is ungrammatical, unidiomatic, or &quot;deviant&quot;. It is familiar enough to have spawned various parodies. Alternative slogans include &quot;&quot; (&quot;the day will be with us&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Power will have another day!&quot;).

==Origins==
The literal English phrase &quot;our day will come&quot; has been used in unrelated contexts, for example as the title of a 1963 pop song by Ruby &amp; the Romantics. A foreshadowing of the republican slogan is in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, when the nationalist Michael Davin (based on George Clancy) says Irish republicans &quot;died for their ideals, Stevie. Our day will come yet, believe me.&quot;

The Irish phrase is attributed to Bobby Sands, a prisoner held at Maze Prison and member of the Provisional IRA – an Irish republican paramilitary force that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland, facilitate Irish reunification and the establishment of an independent republic. He uses the phrase in several writings smuggled out of the Maze Prison. It is the last sentence of the diary he kept of the 1981 hunger strike in which he died, published in 1983 as &quot;One Day in my Life&quot;. However, Diarmait Mac Giolla Chríost has antedated the slogan to a pamphlet published in 1975–77 by Gerry Adams of his experiences in the Maze. Adams himself has ascribed the slogan to Republican prisoners generally, both men in the Maze and women in Armagh Prison. Many republicans learned Irish in prison (a phenomenon known as &quot;Jailtacht&quot;, a pun on ), and conversed regularly with each other through Irish, both for cultural reasons and to keep secrets from the wardens. The Irish language revival movement has often overlapped with Irish nationalism, particularly in Northern Ireland. has been called &quot;the battle cry of the blanketmen&quot;. Republican consciousness raising around the hunger strikes increased awareness of the Irish language in Northern Ireland&#x27;s nationalist community.

Some Irish-language speakers, including Ciarán Carson, contend that is ungrammatical or at least unidiomatic, reflecting L1 interference from English, a phenomenon dubbed . Mac Giolla Chríost is less categorical, on the basis that (&#x27;the day will come&#x27;) is standard Irish; on the other hand, he says typifies the &quot;deviant&quot; nature of Jailtacht Irish.

==Instances==
Patrick Magee said after being sentenced in 1986 for the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing, while his wife in the gallery wore a Katharine Hamnett-style T-shirt with the slogan. Loyalist paramilitary Michael Stone got past the Republican security cordon to commit the 1988 Milltown Cemetery attack by saying . One of four loyalist paramilitaries shouted the phrase at a court sentencing in 2002. At the 2018 Sinn Féin ard fheis, new party leader Mary Lou McDonald concluded her speech with . The phrase, which was not on the script circulated in advance, was criticised by politicians from Fianna Fáil (&quot;hark back to a very dark time&quot;), Fine Gael (&quot;irresponsible&quot;), and the Ulster Unionist Party (&quot;stale rhetoric&quot;).

 (TÁL) is the name of a fanzine for Celtic F.C.&#x27;s Irish republican ultras. It was established in 1991, at which time Celtic were enduring a period of prolonged inferiority to Rangers F.C., their Old Firm rivals, giving &quot;our day will come&quot; an extra resonance. Irish-American folk-rock band LeperKhanz released a 2005 album named &quot;Tiocfaidh Ár Lá&quot;.

The 1992 and 1993 editions of Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;The Student Book: The Indispensable Applicant&#x27;s Guide to UK Colleges, Polytechnics and Universities&quot; advised potential University of Ulster students that &quot;Tiocfaioh ar la&quot; [sic] was a common greeting on campus and meant &quot;pleased to meet you&quot;. This error, suspected to be the result of a prank, was expunged from the 1994 edition. In &quot;A Reality Tour&quot;, a 2003 concert filmed at the Point Depot in Dublin, David Bowie says during the applause after &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;. Gerry Leonard claims to have suggested it to Bowie.

In 2019, Una Mullally commented about an upsurge in the appropriation of Troubles-era slogans by young Irish people on both sides of the border: &quot;There&#x27;s a tacit understanding that a lot of the mindless repetition of IRA slogans such as &#x27;Tiocfaidh ár lá&#x27;, &#x27;Up the RA&#x27; and &#x27;Brits out&#x27; is purposefully goofy – even if the latter two at least are offensive.&quot; A performance the same year in University College Dublin by Kneecap, an Irish-language hip hop trio from West Belfast, was terminated when they led the audience in a chant of , breaching the university&#x27;s policies for &quot;Dignity&quot;, &quot;Respect&quot;, and &quot;Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion&quot;. JD Sports apologised in 2020 when its online catalogue depicted a branded kit for the Northern Ireland football team worn by a model with a visible tattoo reading &quot;ticofaidh ár lá&quot; . In 2021, a Derry charity video Christmas card was withdrawn after protests of its depiction of Gerry Adams singing &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; with &quot;Fa, la, la, la, la, la ...&quot; changed to &quot;tiocfaidh ár lá, lá, lá ...&quot;.

===Legal cases===
The 2007 arrest of Irish-language activist Máire Nic an Bhaird in Belfast was allegedly in part for saying to Police Service of Northern Ireland officers, although she claimed to have said (&quot;your day will come&quot;). She was acquitted on appeal in September 2007.

In 2014, a man who shouted the phrase outside a McDonald&#x27;s in Belfast was convicted of disorderly behaviour when his defence of freedom of expression was rejected.

In 2017, the Fair Employment Tribunal awarded damages to a Catholic employee who had been dismissed after taking sick leave in response to a Protestant manager shouting at her.

==Allusions==
===IRA===
Sinéad Morrissey&#x27;s 2002 poem &quot;Tourism&quot;, describing the economic boom that followed the peace process, states ironically &quot;Our day has come.&quot; Gearóid Mac Lochlainn, a Belfast-born Irish-language poet, uses the phrase in a 2002 poem, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Shopping&quot;), characterised by Mac Giolla Chríost as &quot;the voice of youthful rebellion, ... of hip-hop&quot;. In Mac Lochlainn&#x27;s own English translation of his poem, is left untranslated. Paul Muldoon&#x27;s 2011 poem &quot;Barrage Balloons, Buck Alec, Bird Flu and You&quot;, dedicated to Dermot Seymour, contains the lines &quot;Even Christ&#x27;s checking us out from his observation post. / Even he can&#x27;t quite bend &quot;Tiocfaidh Ár Lá&quot; to the tune of &#x27;Ghost / Riders in the Sky.&#x27;&quot; Kevin Higgins&#x27; 2019 English-language poem &quot;&quot; [&quot;your day will come&quot;] is a satire directed at a unionist who will be forced to learn Irish.

===Other===
Margo Harkin&#x27;s Derry-set 1990 film &quot;Hush-A-Bye Baby&quot; has &quot;a witty scene which nevertheless offended many nationalists&quot;: a republican youth confronts a British soldier with a disjointed mishmash of Irish-language names and phrases, ending with , only for the soldier to challenge him in fluent Irish. In 1993 Desmond Fennell charged the Dublin 4 establishment with neoliberalism and cultural cringe, ends with a call for a &quot;deprovincialised, deimperialised world ... Tiocfaidh ár lá.&quot; Gerald Dawe said this &quot;reads like the old &#x27;Irish-Ireland&#x27; cultural missal&quot;. The introduction, by Stephen Brown of Ulster University, to a 2006 survey of &quot;Celtic marketing&quot; was titled &quot;&quot;.

Commenting on unionist Peter Robinson&#x27;s impending retirement at a 2015 meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council, Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness said, &quot;my day too will come at some stage&quot;, at which Robinson sparked laughter by responding, &quot;It&#x27;s Tiocfaidh ár Lá isn&#x27;t it.&quot; Bookmaker Paddy Power advertised its odds for the outcome of Ireland&#x27;s 2015 same-sex marriage referendum using a photo of kissing men wearing paramilitary-style balaclavas and the tagline .

The Irish rebel song &#x27;SAM song&#x27; contains the chorus &quot;Tiocfaidh Ar Lá, sing Up the &#x27;Ra, SAM missiles in the sky&quot;.

In October 2021, former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage unwittingly used republican slogans in several scripted video clips ordered via Cameo, including a putative birthday message to &quot;Gerard&quot; from &quot;Con and Maggie&quot; at &quot;Chucky Arlaw&#x27;s in Brighton&quot;.

==Variants==
Similar slogans include:

; : () literally translates as &quot;the day will be with us&quot;. Ciarán Carson says it is more idiomatic Irish than . The hybrid form (; &quot;our day will be with us&quot;) is also found among republicans.

; : (; &quot;Power will have another day!&quot;) were the last words from the gallows of Edmund Power of Dungarvan, executed for his part in the Wexford Rebellion of 1798. The phrase was often cited by Éamon de Valera. It occurs in the play , by Brendan Behan; his English translation, &quot;The Hostage&quot;, renders it &quot;we&#x27;ll have another day&quot;. It is echoed in &quot;There will be another day&quot;, the title of republican Peadar O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s 1963 memoir. The slogan is not exclusively a political slogan, and may simply mean &quot;another chance will come&quot;.

Parodies of include:
;Chucky: an English-language pronunciation spelling of , it is pejorative for an Irish republican (sometimes shortened to Chuck).
;: mocking Sinn Féin&#x27;s move towards respectability from the peace process
;&quot;Tiocfaidh Ar La La&quot;: on T-shirts depicting the eponymous Teletubby as an IRA member.
;&quot;Tiocfaidh Arlene&quot;: various jokes about Arlene Foster, former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and First Minister of Northern Ireland.

<text>Ibadan (, ; ) is the capital and most populous city of Oyo State, in Nigeria. It is the third-largest city by population in Nigeria after Lagos and Kano, with a total population of 3,649,000 as of 2021, and nearly 4 million within its metropolitan area. At 3,080 square kilometres it is the country&#x27;s largest city by geographical area (https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/top/1175181-largest-city-nigeria-by-population-land-mass/). At the time of Nigeria&#x27;s independence in 1960, Ibadan was the largest and most populous city in the country, and the second-most populous in Africa behind Cairo. Ibadan is ranked one of the fastest-growing cities in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the UN Human Settlements Program (2022). It is also ranked third in West Africa in the tech startups index. Ibadan joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016.

Ibadan is located in south-western Nigeria, inland northeast of Lagos and southwest of Abuja, the federal capital. It is a prominent transit point between the coastal region and areas in the hinterland of the country. Ibadan had been the administrative center of the old Western Region since the early days of British colonial rule, and parts of the city&#x27;s ancient protective walls still stand to this day. The principal inhabitants of the city are the Yoruba people, as well as various communities (notably Igbo, Hausa, Edo, and Ibibio) from other parts of the country.

== History ==

Ibadan, coined from the phrase &quot;Eba-Odan&quot;, which literally means &#x27;by the edge of the meadow&#x27;, came into existence in 1829, during a period of turmoil that characterized Yorubaland at the time. It was in this period that many old Yoruba cities such as old Oyo (Oyo-ile), Ijaye and Owu disappeared, and newer ones such as Abeokuta, new Oyo (Oyo Atiba) and Ibadan sprang up to replace them. According to local historians, Lagelu founded the city, and was initially intended to be a war camp for warriors coming from Oyo, Ife and Ijebu. As a forest site containing several ranges of hills, varying in elevation from 160 to 275 meters, the location of the camp offered strategic defense opportunities. Moreover, its location at the fringe of the forest (from which the city got its name) promoted its emergence as a marketing center for traders and goods from both the forest and grassland areas.

In 1852, the Church Missionary Society sent David and Anna Hinderer to found a mission. They decided to build the mission and a church in Ibadan when they arrived in 1853.

Ibadan thus had initially begun as a military state and remained so until the last decade of the 19th century. The city-state also succeeded in building a large empire from the 1860s to the 1890s which extended over much of northern and eastern Yorubaland. It was appropriately nicknamed &quot;idi-Ibon&quot; or &quot;gun base&quot;, because of its unique military character.

In Ibadan, unlike other Yoruba cities with traditional kingship institutions, the warrior class became the rulers of the city as well as the most important economic group.

Ibadan grew into an impressive and sprawling urban center, such that by the end of 1829, Ibadan dominated the Yoruba region militarily, politically and economically. The military sanctuary expanded even further when refugees began arriving in large numbers from northern Oyo following raids by Fulani warriors. After losing the northern portion of their region to the marauding Fulanis, many Oyo indigenes retreated deeper into the Ibadan environs. The Fulani Caliphate attempted to expand further into the southern region of modern-day Nigeria, but was decisively defeated by the armies of Ibadan in 1840, which eventually halted their progress. The colonial period reinforced the position of the city in the Yoruba urban network. After a small boom in rubber business (1901–1913), cocoa became the main produce of the region and attracted European and Levantine firms, as well as southern and northern traders from Lagos, Ijebu-Ode and Kano among others. The city became a major point of bulk trade. In 1893, the Ibadan area became a British Protectorate after a treaty signed by Fijabi, the Baale of Ibadan with the British acting Governor of Lagos Colony, George C. Denton on 15 August.

Its central location and accessibility from the capital city of Lagos were major considerations in the choice of Ibadan as the headquarters of the Western Provinces (1939) which ranged from the northernmost areas of Oyo State to Ekeremor, Bomadi and Patani, which were regions transferred from the old Delta province in the Old Western region and later Mid-west to the old Rivers state and later Bayelsa, in the redistricting of Nigeria carried out by the Yakubu Gowon administration shortly before the Nigerian Civil War.

In 2024, Ibadan was the site of a failed coup attempt by Yoruba separatists.

== Geography ==
Ibadan is located in south-western Nigeria in the southeastern part of Oyo State at about northeast of Lagos and east of the Nigerian international border with the Republic of Benin. It lies completely within the tropical forest zone but close to the boundary between the forest and the derived savanna. The city ranges in elevation from 150 m in the valley area, to 275 m above sea level on the major north–south ridge which crosses the central part of the city. The city covers a total area of , the largest in Nigeria.

The city of Ibadan is naturally drained by five rivers with many tributaries: Ona River in the North and West; Ogbere River towards the East; Ogunpa River flowing through the city and Kudeti River in the Central part of the metropolis. Ogunpa River, a third-order stream with a channel length of 12.76 km and a catchment area of 54.92 km2. Lake Eleyele is located at the northwestern part of the city, while the Osun River, Asejire Lake bounds the city to the east and the fifth rivers boundary Ibadan with other Oke-Oguns towns, witch call Odo-ogun Rivers across Lagos State, Ogun State, Osun State, Iseyin Town and Eruwa Town boundary to Ibadan.

=== Climate ===
Ibadan has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;), with a lengthy wet season and relatively constant temperatures throughout the year. Ibadan&#x27;s wet season runs from March through October, though August sees somewhat of a lull in precipitation. This lull divides the wet season into two different wet seasons. November to February forms the city&#x27;s dry season, during which Ibadan experiences the typical West African harmattan. The mean total rainfall for Ibadan is approximately , falling over about 123 days. There are two peaks for rainfall, June and September. The mean daily temperature is , the mean minimum , and the relative humidity 74.55%.

== Government Administration ==
There are 11 local governments in the Ibadan metropolitan area, consisting of five urban local governments in the city and six semi-urban local governments. Local governments at present are institutions created by the military government but recognised by the 1999 constitution, and they are the third tier of government in Nigeria. Local government councils consist of the Executive Arm made up of the Executive Chairman, the Vice Chairman, the Secretary and the Supervisory Councillors.

== Demographics ==
Until 1970, Ibadan was the largest city in Sub-Saharan Africa by surface area. In 1952, it was estimated that the total area of the city was approximately 103.8 km2. However, only 36.2 km2 was built up. This meant that the remaining 67 km2 were devoted to non-urban uses, such as farmlands, river floodplains, forest reserves and water bodies. These &quot;non-urban land uses&quot; disappeared in the 1960s: an aerial photograph in 1973 revealed that the urban landscape had completely spread over about 100 km2. The land area increased from 136 km2 in 1981 to 210–240 km2 in 1988-89 (Areola, 1994: 101). By 2000, it is estimated that Ibadan covered 400 km2. The growth of the built-up area during the second half of the 20th century (from 40 km2 in the 1950s to 250 km2 in the 1990s) shows clearly that there has been an underestimate of the total growth of the city. In the 1980s, the Ibadan-Lagos expressway generated the greatest urban sprawl (east and north of the city), followed by the Eleiyele expressway (west of the city). Since then, Ibadan city has spread further into the neighbouring local government areas of Akinyele and Egbeda in particular.

== Places of worship ==
Among the places of worship, there are Christian churches and temples: Christ Apostolic Church, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Dominion City Church,Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, HarvestHouse Christian Centre, The Covenant Nation, Assemblies of God, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ibadan (Catholic Church), Ensign Church of Nations, The Deeper Life Bible Church,and some Pentecostal churches, and Muslim mosques.

<text>Five Iron Frenzy is an American band which formed in Denver, Colorado, in 1995. Best known for playing ska punk music characterized by an offbeat sense of humor and prominent Christian themes, Five Iron Frenzy was one of the pioneering figures of the Christian ska movement which emerged with ska&#x27;s mainstream revival in the 1990s. Since 2000, the band&#x27;s music has shifted away from straight ska to include and embrace stronger alternative rock and pop punk influences, though it continues to create ska music and feature Christian lyrical themes despite several members&#x27; changes in religious beliefs.

Five Iron Frenzy experienced their greatest commercial success during the late 1990s as part of the American ska revival, touring prolifically within both Christian and secular markets, where the band gained a cult following for their energetic live shows typified by humorous stage antics which often drew attention to various social causes and charities. By the early 2000s, Five Iron Frenzy had independently sold a total of almost one million albums, though a number of factors eventually contributed to their break-up in 2003. After an eight-year hiatus, the band reunited in 2011 to resume intermittent touring, launching a coincident Kickstarter campaign to finance a new album which raised a then record-breaking $207,980. The resultant album, &quot;Engine of a Million Plots&quot;, was released in November 2013.

Five Iron Frenzy is often noted for the broad tonal range of their lyricism, covering subject matter both spiritual and secular in manners both serious and satirical. Many of the band&#x27;s songs are firmly rooted in Social Gospel convictions, often exploring themes of Christian hypocrisy and fundamentalism, manifest destiny and the injustices done to Native Americans, and faith-based criticisms of capitalism, consumerism, nationalism, xenophobia, racism, homophobia and even the Christian music industry, as well as more traditional and uplifting songs of praise and worship. The band is also known for their comic songs which rely on droll self-deprecating and self-referential humor, absurdist non-sequiturs and frequent references to pop culture and geek culture.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1993–1996)===
The origins of Five Iron Frenzy were with the band Exhumator, a Denver-based Christian industrial thrash metal project which featured future Five Iron Frenzy vocalist Reese Roper, guitarists Micah Ortega and Scott Kerr, bassist Keith Hoerig and drummer Andrew Verdecchio. As punk rock and ska had begun making a popular resurgence in alternative music in the early 1990s, the members of Exhumator soon began shifting their attention away from metal, and, largely influenced by bands such as Skankin&#x27; Pickle and NOFX, formed Five Iron Frenzy as a ska/pop punk side project in early 1995. The name &quot;Five Iron Frenzy&quot; was a band in-joke, conceived during an occasion when the members&#x27; &quot;paranoid&quot; roommate brandished a golf club in self-defense out of an unfounded fear of being mugged.

Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s first show, hosted at a church coffeehouse in April 1995, was as an opening act for Exhumator. According to Reese Roper&#x27;s recollection of the event, the audience responded to Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s music better than they had ever responded to Exhumator&#x27;s, and realizing that everyone had more fun playing ska punk than metal, made the decision to dissolve Exhumator in favor of Five Iron Frenzy that very night. Over their next few shows, the band gradually recruited a horn section consisting of trumpeter Nathaniel &quot;Brad&quot; Dunham, trombonist Dennis Culp and Micah Ortega&#x27;s cousin, saxophonist Leanor Ortega.

Almost instantly, Five Iron Frenzy became a prominent presence in the Denver music scene. The band opened for Tooth &amp; Nail Records artists MxPx for their third show and played over sixty shows during their first eight months, soon becoming a staple of every major ska show in the Denver area, opening for such nationally successful touring bands as The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Less Than Jake. Although Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s initial intent was to stay local and help develop their own scene, in June 1995, the band traveled to the Cornerstone Festival in Bushnell, Illinois, to play an impromptu set before several prominent Christian alternative bands and record labels, including Ghoti Hook, Crashdog and Alex Parker of Flying Tart Records. The band has since partially attributed their early success to this stunt, as they would return to Cornerstone the following year sponsored by a record label.

As their local popularity grew, Five Iron Frenzy solidified a &quot;mission statement&quot; that they would play half regular venues and half Christian venues to reach both secular and Christian audiences. By the summer of 1996, the band had released their first recorded material — a 7&quot; single entitled &quot;It″s Funny, But Not Very Creative&quot;, which featured two original songs and a tongue-in-cheek punk rock cover of Amy Grant″s 1985 hit &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot; — and were entertaining offers from several major Christian record labels including Tooth &amp; Nail, Alarma and Brainstorm Artists International before ultimately signing with 5 Minute Walk Records. In September, Five Iron Frenzy recorded their first studio album &quot;Upbeats and Beatdowns&quot;, which was released later that November.

=== &quot;Upbeats and Beatdowns&quot;, national recognition and &quot;Our Newest Album Ever!&quot; (1997–1999) ===
In April 1997, &quot;Upbeats and Beatdowns&quot; was given a national re-release on 5 Minute Walk&#x27;s newly founded sub-label SaraBellum Records, which was in distribution partnership with the Warner Music Group. Released during the peak of ska punk&#x27;s mainstream reign, &quot;Upbeats and Beatdowns&quot; proved to be a modest but significant success for the band, selling over 50,000 units in 1997 and peaking at number 39 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Contemporary Christian chart, while a music video for the single &quot;A Flowery Song&quot; earned a Dove Award nomination for Short Form Music Video of the Year. Five Iron Frenzy retrospectively described their initial success as completely unexpected, though the band ultimately credited their sudden surge of independent fame less to the quality of their music and more to the effect of ska punk&#x27;s mainstream popularity and the &quot;niche market&quot; of Christian music. In a 1997 interview, primary composer Scott Kerr lamented &quot;[t]he unfortunate reality is that good songs and good live performances have far less to do with our so-called success than our being a part of the &#x27;flavor-of-the-month&#x27;.&quot;

Following the success of &quot;Upbeats and Beatdowns&quot;, the members of Five Iron Frenzy were able to quit their day jobs and devote themselves to the band full-time. The group spent the remainder of 1997 touring nationally, playing over 150 shows across the country. Many of these shows and tours were held in promotion of various social causes and charities; during the band&#x27;s &quot;Rock Your Socks Off Tour&quot; in October 1997, fans were asked to bring clean socks for donation. Many of these charitable endeavors were supported or organized by 5 Minute Walk. In a 2012 interview, Reese Roper praised the label for &quot;[putting] their money where their mouth was. For being underground and for what they were, they really did want to help people&quot;. This would ultimately influence the band&#x27;s decision to remain independent under 5 Minute Walk, despite having the opportunities to sign with larger labels.

Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s second album, &quot;Our Newest Album Ever!&quot;, was released in November 1997 and experienced a similarly modest commercial success like that of &quot;Upbeats and Beatdowns&quot;, debuting at number 8 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers and peaking at number 176 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In wake of the album&#x27;s release, Five Iron Frenzy participated in two high-profile national tours. In Spring 1998, the band performed on the Ska Against Racism tour, a ska punk tour orchestrated by Mike Park of Asian Man Records, which raised money for anti-racism organizations. As the only openly Christian band on the tour, Ska Against Racism helped further strengthen Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s reputation among secular audiences: Reese Roper recalled the band making many new fans from attendees who were initially worried the band would attempt to &quot;shove religion down their throats&quot;, as well as forming lasting friendships with most of the secular bands on the roster. Following the end of Ska Against Racism, Five Iron Frenzy quickly wrote and recorded a new album in preparation for their next national tour, resulting in the 40-minute 17-track &quot;EP&quot; &quot;Quantity Is Job 1&quot;, which was reportedly written in only two weeks.

In late 1998, Five Iron Frenzy took part in SkaMania, a national tour which paired them with the other two most commercially successful bands in the Christian ska market, The O.C. Supertones and The Insyderz. The tour was a resounding success within the Christian alternative scene, drawing around 3,000 attendees a night and helping boost sales of &quot;Quantity Is Job 1&quot; into the top fifteen of both &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Contemporary Christian chart and Top Heatseekers. At this time, Scott Kerr announced his decision to depart Five Iron Frenzy following the end of the SkaMania tour. Kerr cited several reasons for choosing to leave the band, including wanting to spend more time with his wife and desiring to explore other musical projects away from ska and punk, though would later explain that his primary reason was having gradually lost his faith in Christianity. Upon leaving Five Iron Frenzy, Kerr would form the Denver-based power pop band Yellow Second, in which he served as lead singer, songwriter and guitarist. Sonnie Johnson, former guitarist for California ska punk band Jeffries Fan Club, replaced Kerr in Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s line-up.

Five Iron Frenzy released their first live album, &quot;Proof That the Youth Are Revolting&quot;, in November 1999, containing recordings of several live shows across 1998 and 1999, including the 1999 Cornerstone Festival. During the recording of these shows, Five Iron Frenzy offered forms at their merchandise booth where fans could provide their names and therefore be credited as &quot;backup singers&quot; for the album. Over 7,000 names were eventually printed in the CD&#x27;s liner notes. &quot;Proof That the Youth Are Revolting&quot; cracked the top ten of both &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers and Contemporary Christian charts, peaking at number 190 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

=== &quot;All the Hype That Money Can Buy&quot; and &quot;Five Iron Frenzy 2: Electric Boogaloo&quot; (2000–2001) ===
In April 2000, Five Iron Frenzy released their third album &quot;All the Hype That Money Can Buy&quot;. By this time, public and media interest in ska music had waned significantly, and, motivated by the desire to not &quot;put out the same record twice&quot;, &quot;All the Hype That Money Can Buy&quot; found Five Iron Frenzy diversifying their sound far beyond ska, incorporating stronger rock and punk influences as well as elements of Latin music, salsa, calypso and reggae. The album included the song &quot;A New Hope&quot;, which was written about the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Columbine, Colorado, where guitarist Micah Ortega&#x27;s sister was a student at the time of the shooting. Although the mainstream decline of ska music worked against the album in promotion and airplay, &quot;All the Hype That Money Can Buy&quot; became Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s then highest-charting release, reaching number 6 on the Contemporary Christian charts and number 146 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Five Iron Frenzy toured internationally throughout the turn of the century, expanding their touring reach across both the European and Oceanic continents. In June 2000, Five Iron Frenzy played five shows in South Africa, one of which was a free concert held in an auditorium in the township of Phuthaditjhaba, where the group spent the majority of the day playing with children from the local orphanage. The members of Five Iron Frenzy noted that nobody in the township had heard of their band and many had never seen an American or even heard rock music before. In a 2010 interview, Reese Roper stated that everybody cared less about the music &quot;as they just did that we were there&quot;. He elaborated on the personal impact of this show, noting that &quot;all of the trappings, all of the barriers I had experienced from being in a band and trying to share the love of Jesus Christ had disappeared&quot;, describing it as &quot;the best day that I ever remember being in Five Iron Frenzy&quot;.

By 2001, Five Iron Frenzy were playing upwards of 250 shows a year. Several members, some of whom had just recently married, began to feel burnt out by the band&#x27;s full-time touring commitments. This burnout was exacerbated by several personal tragedies, including the deaths of Leanor Ortega&#x27;s brother in October 2000 and Andrew Verdecchio&#x27;s father in August 2001, over which both Ortega and Verdecchio spent time questioning their religious faith. Nevertheless, Five Iron Frenzy was scheduled to headline the 49-date &quot;Electric Youth Tour&quot; in late 2001, supported by Christian artists Relient K, John Reuben and Ace Troubleshooter. Three days before the tour was set to begin in Fishkill, New York, the September 11 terrorist attacks were carried out in nearby Manhattan. Although the band initially questioned whether it was appropriate to tour in wake of the events, they chose to proceed with the tour as planned, a decision which was warmly received by audiences, whose numbers averaged around 1,200 a night. As on previous tours, Five Iron Frenzy again asked fans to bring clean socks for donation to local shelters, though on this occasion also used said socks for audience participation games involving sock puppets, as the band felt a need to bring people together under light-hearted circumstances.

Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Five Iron Frenzy 2: Electric Boogaloo&quot;, was released in November 2001 and marked a drastic stylistic shift from the band&#x27;s previous albums. Though the group retained their prominent horn section, &quot;Electric Boogaloo&quot; featured none of the ska influences which dominated the band&#x27;s first three albums, instead focusing exclusively on alternative rock and pop punk. Bassist Keith Hoerig described the album as simply &quot;a rock record with horns&quot;, likening the band&#x27;s use of brass to that of such horn-driven rock bands as Chicago. &quot;Electric Boogaloo&quot; also marked the end of Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s record contract with 5 Minute Walk; though the band again considered the possibility of signing to a major label — according to Micah Ortega, an A&amp;R executive from Atlantic Records visited Five Iron Frenzy during the recording of &quot;Electric Boogaloo&quot; — they ultimately chose to remain with 5 Minute Walk, citing the label&#x27;s commitment to ministry. At the time of &quot;Electric Boogaloo&quot;″s release, Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s collective discography had sold over 500,000 units worldwide. However, the album proved to be a minor disappointment, debuting at number 19 on the Contemporary Christian charts and failing to chart at all on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their first album to not do so since their debut.

=== Breakup and &quot;The End is Near&quot; (2002–2003) ===
Five Iron Frenzy significantly scaled back their touring for most of 2002, headlining only one tour among several festival appearances and fifteen dates on the Vans Warped Tour. As had been band tradition, Five Iron Frenzy met with their pastor for a spiritual retreat at the end of the year to discuss their forthcoming career plans; Micah Ortega recalled this meeting being the first time where opinions were sharply divided between members, primarily over whether to continue Five Iron Frenzy full-time or part-time. In light of several other contributing factors — not the least of which included Andrew Verdecchio&#x27;s decision to leave the Christian faith and therefore the band — Five Iron Frenzy unanimously agreed to disband at the end of 2003, allowing themselves enough time to record a final album and embark on a &quot;farewell tour&quot; for the sake of their fans. The group officially announced their break-up in an open letter posted to their website on February 14, 2003, extensively thanking their fanbase and detailing their plans for their shows and releases up until what would be their final concert in November.

While recording what was intended to be their last studio album, Five Iron Frenzy released &quot;Cheeses...(of Nazareth)&quot;, a 33-track compilation consisting of various unreleased songs, b-sides, demos, live recordings and improvised joke tracks. Despite being described as merely a parting gift to their fanbase, the album received national distribution through EMI and reached number 17 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers and number 22 on the Contemporary Christian charts. In June, the first pressing of Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s fifth and final album, &quot;The End is Near&quot;, was released independently and sold exclusively at the band&#x27;s live shows.

Five Iron Frenzy spent the summer of 2003 performing at various high-profile Christian music festivals across the United States and Canada, including the Agape Music Festival in Illinois, the Alive Festival in Ohio, Lifest in Wisconsin, Spirit West Coast in California and the Florida and Illinois Cornerstone Festival. When the band finished their final set at the Illinois Cornerstone, the audience chanted &quot;thank you&quot; in unison as they left the stage. Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s final national tour, cheekily titled the &quot;Winners Never Quit Tour&quot;, began in mid-September, spanning 58 shows across 31 states, supported by Christian artists Bleach, Holland and Cameron Jaymes. Prior to the tour&#x27;s commencement, Five Iron Frenzy partnered with Rohi ministries in Kenya to open a children&#x27;s rescue center and asked anyone attending their final tour to contribute at least one dollar to the fund. By the tour&#x27;s end, the band had raised over $48,000 for what was unofficially called &quot;The Five Iron Frenzy Rescue Center&quot;; in a 2012 interview, Leanor Ortega-Till revealed the fund had ultimately raised over $60,000 from fan donations alone, which had helped open an additional center.

Five Iron Frenzy played their final show at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver on November 22, 2003, supported by Relient K, Bleach and Cameron Jaymes, drawing a sold-out crowd of over 3,900 people. This show was professionally recorded to be released as the band&#x27;s second live album titled &quot;The End is Here&quot;, which was packaged as a double-disc set with &quot;The End is Near&quot; for mainstream retail distribution. This version of the album, stylized as &quot;The End is Near Here&quot;, was released in April 2004 and met with modest commercial success, reaching number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Christian charts.

=== Hiatus and side projects (2004–2010) ===
Following the dissolution of Five Iron Frenzy, most of the band members parted ways to focus on their personal lives and pursue other musical endeavors, remaining active in numerous local bands.

Several members of Five Iron Frenzy continued to collaborate with each other beyond the band&#x27;s initial break-up. Reese Roper, Dennis Culp, Keith Hoerig, Andrew Verdecchio and Scott Kerr were founding members of the conceptual Christian rock side project Brave Saint Saturn in 1999, and released &quot;So Far from Home&quot; on 5 Minute Walk in 2000. Roper, Culp, Hoerig and Verdecchio continued their work with Brave Saint Saturn after Five Iron Frenzy, releasing &quot;The Light of Things Hoped For&quot; in 2003 on Tooth &amp; Nail Records and the self-released &quot;Anti-Meridian&quot; in 2008 before falling into an indefinite hiatus shortly after. Roper was also involved with the prospective pop punk supergroup Guerilla Rodeo, featuring Ethan Luck, John Warne, Josh Abbott of Ace Troubleshooter and Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s Sonnie Johnston. The band recorded a three-song EP in 2004 but the project never came to fruition and was instead gradually restructured into the solo project Roper, retaining only Roper as frontman and singer-songwriter. Roper released one album &quot;Brace Yourself for the Mediocre&quot; in late 2004 before disbanding the following year, upon which Roper retired to focus on a full-time career in nursing, though would occasionally contribute guest vocals to albums by bands including Showbread and The Insyderz.

Culp, having released his own solo album &quot;Ascents&quot; under the name Dennis Bayne in 2000 (on which Verdecchio also performed), founded the music and sound design studio Singing Serpent in 2005, composing music for television advertising as well as appearing as a guest musician on albums by bands including Rafter and Becoming the Archetype. Scott Kerr continued his work with Yellow Second, releasing three studio albums before disbanding in 2005; their final album, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Altitude&quot; released on Floodgate Records, also featured Verdecchio as a member. Keith Hoerig and his wife Eryn formed the Denver-based alternative country band The Hollyfelds in 2006, independently recording and releasing two studio albums and two EPs before their disbandment in 2016. In the mid-to-late-2000s, Leanor Ortega-Till played alongside her husband Stephen Till in the nine-piece pop ensemble Hearts of Palm.

Roper and Leanor Ortega-Till also self-published books of their own poetry, Roper having published &quot;Spires to Babel&quot; in 2003 and &quot;More Than Paper Thin&quot; in 2004, and Ortega-Till having published &quot;It Must Look Pretty Appealing&quot; in 2003. In January 2004, Roper and Ortega-Till embarked on a brief spoken word tour with Mark Salomon of Stavesacre and Pigeon John of LA Symphony reading their own writings and poetry. Verdecchio has also since released books of his own writing, including the 2017 poetry collection &quot;October&quot; and the 2018 storybook &quot;Little&quot;.

In April 2010, Asian Man Records released the DVD &quot;The Rise and Fall of Five Iron Frenzy&quot;, a three-hour documentary on the band edited and narrated by Roper featuring new interviews with band members and unreleased archival footage, as well as a bonus disc containing all of the band&#x27;s music videos and clips of various live performances throughout their career. Though the DVD received mixed reviews from Christian music publications - ranging from a perfect five-star rating by &quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot; praising its abundance of content to a two-star rating from &quot;Indie Vision Music&quot; criticizing its excessive runtime — Five Iron Frenzy nonetheless experienced a minor resurgence of renewed media interest, and members began giving numerous interviews together about the band&#x27;s lasting legacy, including an extensive oral history published by the Denver &quot;Westword&quot; from Roper, Kerr, Verdecchio and Leanor Ortega-Till.

=== Reunion, &quot;Engine of a Million Plots&quot;, and &quot;Until This Shakes Apart&quot; (2011–present) ===
The prospect of a Five Iron Frenzy reunion was first discussed between band members during the filming of &quot;The Rise and Fall of Five Iron Frenzy&quot; in 2009. According to Roper, Scott Kerr was the first to express an interest in musically reconnecting with his former bandmates, though doubted the likelihood of a proper Five Iron Frenzy reunion and less so his role in such a reunion, having relinquished his original position in the band to Sonnie Johnston. After Keith Hoerig declined to participate in any type of Five Iron Frenzy reunion, Roper suggested that Kerr potentially return to the band as bassist, upon which Kerr began writing new material. Roper and Kerr discussed the logistics of reforming and writing new music for six months until a series of various life events including the birth of Roper&#x27;s daughter and the relocation of several band members eventually prompted them to eventually abandon the idea.

In late 2011, Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s website was suddenly replaced by an unexplained countdown clock counting down to November 22, the eighth anniversary of the band&#x27;s final show. Since 2006, the website had been operated as a fansite by fan Joel Gratcyk, who had at that time renewed the domain name and planned to surprise fans by launching a new site on November 22, though the vague countdown inadvertently fueled mass speculation among fans that Five Iron Frenzy themselves were going to announce a reunion on that date. Gratcyk contacted the band asking them to draft a formal apology to clarify the misunderstanding and dispel rumors of a reunion, though as Roper was in the process of doing so, instead decided to officially reform Five Iron Frenzy. The band chose to keep the news a secret and honor the November 22 reveal date, granting them enough time to write and record a new song and create a crowdfunding campaign for a new album on Kickstarter, both of which would be unveiled in conjunction with the announcement of their reunion.

Five Iron Frenzy formally announced their reunion on November 22, 2011, releasing their first new song in eight years, &quot;It Was a Dark and Stormy Night&quot;, as a free digital download alongside a two-month Kickstarter campaign to help cover the costs of production for a new studio album set to be released in 2013. To the band&#x27;s admitted shock and surprise, the campaign&#x27;s initial financial goal of $30,000 was successfully met within 55 minutes and went on to ultimately raise $207,980 by 3,755 backers, breaking records as Kickstarter&#x27;s then most funded musical project and attracting considerable media attention from news publications documenting the website&#x27;s growing notoriety.

The next two years were spent working on the new album and playing select live dates. The band played their first reunion show on April 28, 2012, in Denver, Colorado. &quot;Engine of a Million Plots&quot; was released on November 26, 2013.

&quot;Until This Shakes Apart&quot; was released on January 15, 2021, after a successful Kickstarter campaign. A digital pre-release was available to Kickstarted backers on January 14, 2021.

In July 2022, the band announced on social media that they will play their first live show after 3 years, at the Gothic Theater in Denver, CO, on September 10, 2022.

== Religious affiliations and changes in faith ==
As a predominantly Christian band, most members of Five Iron Frenzy are involved in Christian ministry to varying degrees. Roper is a licensed pastor for the Alliance of Renewal Churches and the co-founder of Denver&#x27;s non-denominational Scum of the Earth Church, of which saxophonist Leanor Ortega-Till formerly served as the Women and Arts pastor. In a 2016 interview, Ortega-Till listed the rest of the current lineup&#x27;s denominational make up as including Calvinist, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Church of Christ and Assemblies of God.

In 1998, Scott Kerr chose to leave Five Iron Frenzy after renouncing his Christian faith. According to Kerr, he had begun experiencing doubts in high school which eventually came to a head during his time touring with Five Iron Frenzy. In an attempt to reconcile his faith, Kerr fervently studied Christian apologetics — which he ultimately found &quot;not persuasive and, at worst, intellectually disingenuous&quot; — as well as works by David Hume and Bertrand Russell before deciding to leave Christianity. Though Kerr recalls the band accepting his revelation and decision to leave, Roper remorsefully recalled souring the relationship between them by him &quot;pushing Jesus on [Kerr] when he needed me to just be his friend&quot;, which later served as the lyrical basis for Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s song &quot;To Start a Fire&quot;. Upon re-joining Five Iron Frenzy in 2011, Kerr wrote an explanation for his reunion with the band which partly read:

Andrew Verdecchio experienced a similar loss of faith during the early 2000s, following the death of his father and the events of the September 11 attacks. Verdecchio largely recalls the comments of conservative commentators Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell blaming the cause of the attacks on homosexuals for driving a wedge between himself and Christianity, leading him to seriously question his beliefs and role within a Christian band. Like Kerr, Verdecchio attempted to study apologetics &quot;because I didn&#x27;t want to not believe it&quot;, though said &quot;the more I read these books and tried to convince myself, the less convinced I was&quot;. Upon renouncing his faith, Verdecchio requested to carry out one more tour with the band before quitting, upon which they decided to disband afterwards as Five Iron Frenzy did not wish to replace him. Verdecchio still identifies as an atheist.

Leanor Ortega-Till has also spoken about having struggled with severe doubts for a two-year period which caused her to try to avoid fans, though was ultimately able to &quot;bounce back through her faith&quot; and remains a practicing Christian.

<text>The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) is a nonprofit organization that works with partners to enhance crop quality and productivity, reduce producer and consumer risks, and generate wealth from agriculture, with the ultimate goals of reducing hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. IITA&#x27;s research-for-development (R4D) focuses on addressing the development needs of tropical countries. The institute was established in 1967 and headquarters located in Ibadan, Nigeria, with several research stations spread across Africa. The organization is governed by a Board of Trustees, supported by several countries and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).

==History==
IITA was established in 1967 in Ibadan as a result of the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations&#x27; desire to establish a center for the improvement of the quality of tropical foods. The institute came into existence with the enactment of decree 32. of 1967. Part of the institute&#x27;s initial goals was to develop a better productive farming system, the selection and breeding of high-yielding crop varieties that are resistant to diseases and pests, and strengthening agricultural research in the humid and tropic regions. The institute was initially situated on a 1000-hectare land. The institute focused on a cereal improvement program, grain and legumes improvement program, farming systems, and root and tuber improvement program. The grain and legume improvement system consisted of soybean, cowpea and tuber program composed of yam and cassava. 

IITA joined CGIAR in 1971. It later added tree products such as plantain and banana. 

== Partnership ==
The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) is partnered with the federal government of Nigeria and World Bank to improve agriculture in Nigeria. 

=== Jigawa ===
The institute partners with the Jigawa government to revolutionize agriculture in Jigawa state.

=== Training ===
In early 2024, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) trained youth in agriculture business to empower and boost productivity in agriculture in Nigeria.

<doc id="355323" wikidata="Q1068892" url="?curid=355323" title="Cheesesteak">
<text>A cheesesteak (also known as a Philadelphia cheesesteak, Philly cheesesteak, cheesesteak sandwich, cheese steak, or steak and cheese) is a sandwich made from thinly sliced pieces of beefsteak and melted cheese in a long hoagie roll. A popular regional fast food, it has its roots in the United States city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

== History ==
The cheesesteak was developed in the early 20th century &quot;by combining beef, onions, and cheese in a small loaf of bread&quot;, according to a 1987 exhibition catalog published by the Library Company of Philadelphia and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

Philadelphians Pat and Harry Olivieri are often credited with inventing the sandwich by serving chopped steak on an Italian roll in the early 1930s. The exact story behind its creation is debated, but according to many accounts, Pat and Harry Olivieri originally owned a hot dog stand, and on one occasion, decided to make a new sandwich using chopped beef and grilled onions. While Pat was eating the sandwich, a cab driver stopped by and was interested in it, so he requested one for himself. After eating it, the cab driver suggested that Olivieri quit making hot dogs and instead focus on the new sandwich. They began selling this variation of steak sandwiches at their hot dog stand near South Philadelphia&#x27;s Italian Market. They became so popular that Pat opened up his own restaurant which still operates today as Pat&#x27;s King of Steaks.

The sandwich was originally prepared without cheese; Olivieri said provolone cheese was first added by &quot;Cocky Joe&quot; Lorenza, a manager at the Ridge Avenue location. No actual documentary evidence exists of the Olivieri story, however, and like many such origin stories it may be apocryphal, perpetuated by the author&#x27;s retelling. The cheesesteak may well have appeared and spread gradually among anonymous cooks.

Cheesesteaks have become popular at restaurants and food carts throughout the city with many locations being independently owned, family-run businesses. Variations of cheesesteaks are now common in several fast food chains. Versions of the sandwich can also be found at high-end restaurants. Many establishments outside of Philadelphia refer to the sandwich as a &quot;Philly cheesesteak&quot;.

== Description ==

===Meat===
The meat traditionally used is thinly sliced rib-eye or top round, although other cuts of beef are also used. On a lightly oiled griddle at medium temperature, the steak slices are quickly browned and then scrambled into smaller pieces with a flat spatula. Slices of cheese are then placed over the meat, letting it melt, and then the roll is placed on top of the cheese. The mixture is then scooped up with a spatula and pressed into the roll, which is then cut in half.

Common additions include sautéed onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper.

===Bread===
In Philadelphia, cheesesteaks are invariably served on hoagie rolls. Among several brands, perhaps the most famous are Amoroso rolls; these rolls are long, soft, and slightly salted. One source writes that &quot;a proper cheesesteak consists of provolone or Cheez Whiz slathered on an Amoroso roll and stuffed with thinly shaved grilled meat,&quot; while a reader&#x27;s letter to an Indianapolis magazine, lamenting the unavailability of good cheesesteaks, wrote that &quot;the mention of the Amoroso roll brought tears to my eyes.&quot; After commenting on the debates over types of cheese and &quot;chopped steak or sliced&quot;, &quot;Risk and Insurance&quot; magazine declared, &quot;The only thing nearly everybody can agree on is that it all has to be piled onto a fresh, locally baked Amoroso roll.&quot;

Food distributors often suggest or sell sandwiches which are inspired by the classic cheesesteak. For example, Pillsbury provides a recipe for &quot;Philly Cheesesteak Wraps&quot; which substitutes a tortilla for the bread. Nestlé offers a &quot;Philly Steak and Cheese&quot; made in the form of a Hot Pocket.

===Cheese===
American cheese, provolone, and Cheez Whiz are the most commonly used cheeses or cheese products put on to the Philly cheesesteak.

Some establishments melt the American cheese to achieve the creamy consistency, while others place slices over the meat, letting them melt slightly under the heat. &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; restaurant critic Craig LaBan says, &quot;Provolone is for aficionados, extra-sharp for the most discriminating among them,&quot; although LaBan was at the time new to the Philadelphia area, and sharp provolone is rarely found in cheesesteak shops, while mild provolone is common. Geno&#x27;s owner, Joey Vento, said, &quot;We always recommend the provolone. That&#x27;s the real cheese.&quot;

Cheez Whiz, first marketed in 1952, was not yet available for the original 1930 version, but has expanded in popularity. A 1986 &quot;New York Times&quot; article called Cheez Whiz &quot;the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of cheesesteak connoisseurs.&quot; In a 1985 interview, Pat Olivieri&#x27;s nephew Frank Olivieri said that he uses &quot;the processed cheese spread familiar to millions of parents who prize speed and ease in fixing the children&#x27;s lunch for the same reason, because it is fast.&quot; Cheez Whiz is &quot;overwhelmingly the favorite&quot; at Pat&#x27;s, outselling runner-up American by a ratio of eight or ten to one, while Geno&#x27;s claims to go through eight to ten cases of Cheez Whiz a day.

Cooper Sharp, a &quot;Pasteurized Process American Cheese&quot;, is gaining ground as a new cheese option as of 2023. Made from aged Cheddar and having a higher milkfat content, the product is sharper and creamier than ordinary American cheese. According to Kosuke Chujo, who runs a cheesesteak shop in Japan, the cheese &quot;was very creamy and delicious with the perfect balance of salt&quot;.

<text>Windsor is a historic town in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. It is the site of Windsor Castle, one of the official residences of the British monarch. The town is situated west of Charing Cross, central London, southeast of Maidenhead, and east of the modern county town of Reading. It is immediately south of the River Thames, which forms its boundary with its smaller, ancient twin town of Eton. The village of Old Windsor, just over to the south, predates what is now called Windsor by around 300 years. In the past, Windsor was formally referred to as New Windsor to distinguish the two.

==Etymology==
&quot;Windlesora&quot; is first mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.&quot; (The settlement had an earlier name but this is unknown.) The name originates from old English &quot;Windles-ore&quot; or &quot;winch by the riverside&quot;. This etymology is shared with Winsor in Hampshire. By 1110, meetings of the Great Council, which had previously taken place at Windlesora, were noted as taking place at the castle, referred to as New Windsor. By the late 12th century the settlement at Windelsora had been renamed Old Windsor.

==History==


===Medieval period===
The early history of the site is unknown, although it was almost certainly settled some years before 1070 when William the Conqueror had a timber motte-and-bailey castle constructed. The focus of royal interest at that time was not the castle, however, but a small riverside settlement about downstream, possibly established from the 7th century. From about the 8th century, high status people as well as royalty began visiting the site. From the 11th century the site&#x27;s link with King Edward the Confessor is documented. In the later medieval period, royal use of the site increased, probably because it offered good access to woodlands and opportunities for hunting – a sport which also developed military skills.

===Plantagenet period===
The settlement at Old Windsor largely transferred to New Windsor during the 12th century, although substantial planning and setting out of the new town (including the parish church, marketplace, bridge, hermitage and leper hospital) did not take place until , under Henry II, following the civil war of Stephen&#x27;s reign. At about the same time, the castle was rebuilt in stone. Windsor Bridge is the earliest bridge on the Thames between Staines and Reading, built at a time when bridge building was rare; it was first documented in 1191 but had probably been built, according to the Pipe rolls, in 1173. It played an important part in the national road system, linking London with Reading and Winchester. By directing traffic into the new town, it underpinned the success of New Windsor&#x27;s fledgling economy.

The town was the site of the Treaty of Windsor in the year 1175, following the Normans invasion of Ireland. The treaty was between Henry II and Ruadhrí Ua Conchobhair, High King of Ireland. The treaty involved agreements regarding the two kings&#x27; respective spheres of influence on the island of Ireland, control over their subjects, and the paying of tribute to Henry. Despite the agreement, the treaty would collapse and conflict in Ireland would continue for several centuries.

The town of New Windsor, as an ancient demesne of the Crown, was a privileged settlement from the start, apparently having the rights of a free borough, for which other towns had to pay substantial fees to the king. It had a merchant guild (known by the 14th century as the Fraternity or brotherhood of the Holy Trinity) from the early 13th century and, under royal patronage, was made the chief town of the county in 1277, as part of its grant of royal borough status by Edward I&#x27;s charter. Somewhat unusually, this charter gave no new rights or privileges to Windsor but probably codified the rights which it had enjoyed for many years.

Windsor&#x27;s position as chief town of Berkshire was short-lived, however, as people found it difficult to reach. Wallingford took over this position in the early 14th century. As a self-governing town Windsor enjoyed a number of freedoms unavailable to other towns, including the right to hold its own borough court, the right of membership (or &#x27;freedom&#x27;) and some financial independence. The town accounts of the 16th century survive in part, although most of the once substantial borough archive dating back to the 12th century was destroyed, probably in the late 17th century.

New Windsor was a nationally significant town in the Middle Ages, certainly one of the fifty wealthiest towns in the country by 1332. Its prosperity came from its close association with the royal household. The repeated investment in the castle brought London merchants (goldsmiths, vintners, spicers and mercers) to the town in the late 13th century and provided much employment for townsmen. The development of the castle under Edward III, between 1350 and 1368, was the largest secular building project in England of the Middle Ages, and many Windsor people worked on this project, again bringing great wealth to the town. Although the Black Death in 1348 had reduced some towns&#x27; populations by up to 50%, in Windsor the building projects of Edward III brought money to the town, and possibly its population doubled: this was a &#x27;boom&#x27; time for the local economy. People came to the town from every part of the country, and from continental Europe. The poet Geoffrey Chaucer held the honorific post of Clerk of the Works at Windsor Castle in 1391.

The development of the castle continued in the late 15th century with the rebuilding of St George&#x27;s Chapel. With this Windsor became a major pilgrimage destination, particularly for Londoners. Pilgrims came to touch the royal shrine of the murdered Henry VI, the fragment of the True Cross and other important relics. Visits to the chapel were probably combined with a visit to the important nearby Marian shrine and college at Eton, founded by Henry VI in 1440, and dedicated to the Assumption; which is now better known as Eton College. Pilgrims came with substantial sums to spend. From perhaps two or three named inns in the late 15th century, some 30 can be identified a century later. The town again grew in wealth. For London pilgrims, Windsor was probably – but briefly – of greater importance than Canterbury and the shrine of that city&#x27;s patron saint Thomas Becket.

===Tudor and Stuart periods===
With the closures of the Reformation, however, Windsor&#x27;s pilgrims traffic died out, and the town began to stagnate about ten years afterwards. The castle was considered old-fashioned and shrines to the dead were thought to be superstitious. The early modern period formed a stark contrast to the medieval history of the town. Henry VIII was buried in St George&#x27;s Chapel in 1547, next to Jane Seymour, the mother of his only legitimate son, Edward (Edward VI). Henry, the founder of the Church of England, may have wanted to benefit from the stream of pilgrims coming to the town. His will gives that impression.

Most accounts of Windsor in the 16th and 17th centuries talk of its poverty, badly made streets and poor housing. Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; is set in Windsor and contains many references to parts of the town and the surrounding countryside. Shakespeare must have walked the town&#x27;s streets, near the castle and river Thames, much as people still do. The play may have been written in the Garter Inn, opposite the Castle, but this was destroyed by fire in the late 17th century. The long-standing – and famous – courtesan of king Charles II, Nell Gwyn, was given a house on St Albans Street: Burford House (now part of the Royal Mews). Her residence in this house, as far as it is possible to tell, was brief. Only one of her letters addressed from Burford House survives: it was probably intended as a legacy for her illegitimate son, the Earl of Burford, later the Duke of St Albans.

Windsor was garrisoned by Colonel Venn during the English Civil War. Later it became the home of the New Model Army when Venn had left the castle in 1645. Despite its royal dependence, like many commercial centres, Windsor was a Parliamentarian town. Charles I was buried without ceremony in St George&#x27;s Chapel after his execution at Whitehall in 1649. The present Guildhall, built in 1680–91, replaced an earlier market house that had been built on the same site around 1580, as well as the old guildhall, which faced the castle and had been built around 1350. The contraction in the number of old public buildings speaks of a town &#x27;clearing the decks&#x27;, ready for a renewed period of prosperity with Charles II&#x27;s return to the Castle.

But his successors did not use the place, and as the town was short of money, the planned new civic buildings did not appear. The town continued in poverty until the mid 19th century. In 1652 the largest house in Windsor Great Park was built on land which Oliver Cromwell had appropriated from the Crown. Now known as Cumberland Lodge after the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s residence there in the mid-18th century, the house was variously known as Byfield House, New Lodge, Ranger&#x27;s Lodge, Windsor Lodge and Great Lodge.

===Georgian and Victorian periods===
In 1778, there was a resumption of the royal presence, with George III at the Queen&#x27;s Lodge and, from 1804, at the castle. This started a period of new development in Windsor, with the building of two army barracks. However the associated large numbers of soldiers led to a major prostitution problem by 1830, in a town where the number of streets had little changed since 1530. In the 18th century the town traded with London selling the Windsor Chair which was actually made in Buckinghamshire.

A number of fine houses were built in this period, including Hadleigh House on Sheet Street, which was built in 1793 by the then mayor of Windsor, William Thomas. In 1811 it was the home of John O&#x27;Reilly, the apothecary-surgeon to George III. Windsor Castle was the westernmost sighting-point for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), which measured the precise distance between the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Paris Observatory by trigonometry. Windsor was used because of its relative proximity to the base-line of the survey at Hounslow Heath.
The substantial redevelopment of the castle in the subsequent decade and Queen Victoria&#x27;s residence from 1840, as well as the coming of two railways in 1849, signalled the most dramatic changes in the town&#x27;s history. These events catapulted the town from a sleepy medieval has-been to the centre of empire – many European crowned heads of state came to Windsor to visit the Queen throughout the rest of the 19th century. Unfortunately, excessive redevelopment and &#x27;refurbishment&#x27; of Windsor&#x27;s medieval fabric at this time resulted in widespread destruction of the old town, including the demolition of the old parish church of St John the Baptist in 1820. The original had been built around 1135.

===Later periods===
Most of the current town&#x27;s streets date from the mid to late 19th century. However the main street, Peascod Street () is very ancient, predating the castle by many years, and probably of Anglo-Saxon origin. It formed part of the 10th-century parish structure in east Berkshire and is first referred to as Peascroftstret in c. 1170. The 1,000-year-old royal castle, although the largest and longest-occupied in Europe, is a recent development in comparison.

==Religion==
The original parish church of Windsor is dedicated to St John the Baptist and is situated adjacent to the High Street. The church is said to have dated from the time that King Henry I moved the Royal Court from Old Windsor to &#x27;New Windsor&#x27;. The church was clearly established by the time of Henry II in about 1110, as there are references to it by then. In 1543, Henry Filmer, Robert Testwood and Anthony Pearson, the three Windsor Martyrs, were burnt at the stake in Deanery Gardens, near the church. The original church building had Saxon arches and Norman work and by the 18th century it was described as &#x27;a vast building with 10 side altars and several chantries&#x27; and perhaps eight gabled roofs. There was a small spire on top of the main central tower.

In 1818 the high cost of repairs to the old building led to plans for a complete rebuild at a cost of £14,000. Charles Hollis was appointed architect and the new building was erected between 1820 and 1822 with cast iron columns that were floated down the Thames. The ribs that support the roof are also cast iron. The new church, Gothic in style with a pinnacle tower containing the bells, was officially consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury on 22 June 1822. Samuel Sanders Teulon added the chancel and the apse in 1880. The chancel screen was added in 1898 to mark the 60-year reign of Queen Victoria. In 1906 the Hunter organ was installed. The north side gallery was reduced in length to make way for the organ.

The more recent church of All Saints&#x27; is situated on Frances Road. The incumbent vicar is the Revd Canon Sally Lodge. The author Thomas Hardy trained as an architect and joined Arthur Blomfield&#x27;s practice as assistant architect in April 1862. Between 1862 and 1864 he worked with Blomfield on All Saints&#x27;. A reredos, possibly designed by Hardy, was discovered behind panelling at All Saints&#x27; in August 2016.

==Tourism==

As a result of the castle, Windsor is a popular tourist destination and has facilities usually found in larger towns: two railway stations, a theatre and several substantial hotels. Various boat trips operate on the River Thames, with connections to Maidenhead and Staines-upon-Thames. In winter, Alexandra Gardens hosts a temporary ice rink. Near the town is Legoland Windsor Resort, the only Legoland park in the United Kingdom and the largest Legoland park in the world in terms of area. Legoland Windsor was built on the site of the former Windsor Safari Park.

==Shopping==

As a tourist town there are many gift shops around the castle, and there are shops and restaurants in Windsor Royal Station inside Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station. The main shopping street is Peascod Street.

== Transport ==

Windsor has two railway stations. Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station is the southern terminus of the Slough–Windsor &amp; Eton line. A Great Western Railway shuttle to Slough connects with services to London Paddington and Reading. Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside station is the terminus for South Western Railway direct services from London Waterloo. Both stations were built at around the same time in the 19th century, as the two train companies which owned the lines both wanted to carry Queen Victoria to Windsor, with the first line opened gaining the privilege. From 1883 to 1885, London&#x27;s District Railway&#x27;s westbound service from ran as far as Windsor.

Bus services in the town are provided by Thames Valley Buses, First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley and Reading Buses. There are frequent bus services between Windsor and Heathrow Airport, Green Line Coach Station in Central London, and Legoland Windsor Resort. Windsor has a large central coach park with 74 spaces to cater mostly for the large tourist groups coming to visit Windsor Castle and town. It is accessed by pedestrians via a footbridge adjacent to Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station. Windsor is linked to the town of Eton (on the opposite bank of the River Thames) by Windsor Bridge. Originally a fully trafficked road bridge, Windsor Bridge is now for pedestrians and cyclists only. To the south of the town lies Windsor Great Park and the towns of Old Windsor, Egham and Virginia Water. Windsor lies on National Cycle Route 4 (London–Fishguard). The main access roads serving the town have adjacent cycle paths or nearby alternative traffic-free cycle routes.

Windsor has links to three local motorways:
* the M3 (junction 3), to the south via the A332, passing Ascot;
* the M4 (junction 6), to the north via the A332, with the A355 spur leading to Slough;
* the M25 (junction 13), to the east via the A308, which continues to Staines-upon-Thames.

==Sport==
Windsor&#x27;s senior football team is Windsor F.C. (2011) The team currently play in the and their home ground was Stag Meadow, granted to the original club by King George V in 1911, before they moved to Holloways Park.

Windsor Cricket Club&#x27;s clubhouse and pitches are at Home Park (public) adjacent to Windsor Castle. The club played host to a 2006 Lord&#x27;s Taverners cricket match. The Windsor 1st team currently play in Division 2A of the Thames Valley League.

Windsor Rugby Club also use the Home Park (public) ground and the team currently plays in the Southern Counties North division.

Several other local sports clubs are based at Home Park (public), including hockey and archery clubs, and the Datchet Dashers running club.

Royal Windsor Rollergirls were one of the first roller derby leagues to be founded in the UK in 2007. They disbanded in 2023.

==Education==

=== State schools ===
State-funded schooling in the town is provided by a system of three-tier schooling. Schools are controlled by either the local authority or academy trusts. The town is served by eleven first schools for children up to 9 years old, and three middle schools until age 13.

Pupils aged 13–18 can elect to attend the town&#x27;s two single-sex secondary schools: The Windsor Boys&#x27; School and Windsor Girls&#x27; School.

=== Independent schools ===
Several independent schools operate in the town, including:

*St George&#x27;s School, Windsor Castle

===Local media===
Local radio stations are community based radio stations such as Radio Roadhouse and Royal Borough Radio.

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the Windsor Express.

==Governance==
There is one tier of local government covering Windsor, at unitary authority level: the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, which has its headquarters in Maidenhead. The Windsor built-up area is unparished. As at November 2023, the possibility of creating a civil parish covering the town was being considered by the borough council, but no decision had been made.

In 2012 the council reintroduced the role of town crier to the borough. The previous town crier had retired in 1892 and for 120 years the post remained vacant. The current crier is Chris Brown

In 2018 the belongings of homeless people were controversially removed and stored for reasons of security. A bus intended to shelter the Windsor homeless was impounded by police.

===Constituency===

The current Member of Parliament for the Windsor constituency (which includes the surrounding small towns and villages, such as Eton and Datchet) is Jack Rankin (Conservative), who was first elected at the 2024 General Election.

===Administrative history===

Windsor was an ancient borough, officially called &#x27;New Windsor&#x27; to distinguish it from the neighbouring village and parish of Old Windsor. New Windsor&#x27;s earliest known charter was issued in 1277, but the evidence suggests the town was administered as a borough prior to that. The borough covered the parish of New Windsor and part of the parish of Clewer. It was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country.

The Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes were no longer allowed to straddle borough boundaries, and so the parish of Clewer was split into parishes called Clewer Within, being within the borough boundaries, and Clewer Without, covering the area outside the borough. Clewer Without was subsequently absorbed into the borough of New Windsor in 1920, after which the borough contained the three parishes of New Windsor, Clewer Within and Clewer Without. The borough council met at Windsor Guildhall.

The borough was styled a royal borough from medieval times. Following a proliferation of other boroughs with royal connections styling themselves as royal boroughs in the early 20th century, the government announced in 1926 that only Windsor and Kensington had official sanction to use the title.

The municipal borough of New Windsor was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, which was allowed to use the style of royal borough. The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead became a unitary authority in 1998 when it took over the functions of the abolished Berkshire County Council.

==Twin towns==
Windsor is twinned with:

*Goslar, Lower Saxony, Germany (since 1969)
*Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France (since 1955)

<doc id="355327" wikidata="Q277846" url="?curid=355327" title="Benvenuto Cellini (opera)">
<text>Benvenuto Cellini is an &quot;opera semiseria&quot; in four &quot;tableaux&quot; (spread across two or three acts) by Hector Berlioz, his first full-length work for the stage. Premiered at the Académie Royale de Musique (Salle Le Peletier) on 10 September 1838, it is a setting of a libretto by Léon de Wailly and Henri Auguste Barbier, who invented most of the plot inspired by the memoirs of the Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini. The opera is technically challenging and was until the 21st century rarely performed. But its overture sometimes features in orchestral concerts, as does the concert overture &quot;Le carnaval romain&quot; which Berlioz composed from material in the opera.

== Composition history ==
Berlioz wrote this in his &quot;Mémoires&quot; about the background to the opera: I had been greatly struck by certain episodes in the life of &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;. I had the misfortune to believe they would make an interesting and dramatic subject for an opera, and I asked Léon de Wailly and Auguste Barbier … to write a libretto around them. The only plot element drawn directly from Cellini&#x27;s memoirs concerns the casting of his famous statue of Perseus with the Head of Medusa for Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, although this was done in Florence, where it still stands in the Loggia dei Lanzi, not in Rome, as the opera has it. All the opera&#x27;s characters besides Cellini and Pope Clement VII, who is made commissioner of the statue in place of Cosimo, and all other episodes, are invented.

The original libretto, which is lost, seems to have been in the format of an &quot;opéra comique&quot;; it was rejected by the Paris Opéra-Comique company. The story was then reworked as an &quot;opéra semiseria&quot;, without spoken dialogue, and offered to the Paris Opéra where it was accepted in 1835 by that company&#x27;s new director, Henri Duponchel. Actual composition started in 1836. Its completion date is unknown. Several Berlioz scholars say it was completed that same year before the composer turned his attention to his massive &quot;Grande messe des morts&quot; in 1837. In any event, its premiere was scheduled for June 1838, postponed, and finally given at the Opéra on 10 September 1838, conducted by François Habeneck and with Gilbert Duprez in the title role. It is likely the composer continued work on the score, or at least made revisions to it, during 1838 after the &quot;Grande messe&quot; was completed.

==Premiere and revisions==
At the premiere, with costumes by Paul Lormier and sets by René-Humanité Philastre and Charles-Antoine Cambon, the audience hissed most of the music after the first few numbers. In 1851, Franz Liszt offered to revive the opera in a new production in Weimar, suggesting changes to the score to Berlioz. A new version was in fact prepared and performed in Weimar the next year, its title role being sung by Karl Beck, the same tenor who had originated Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in 1850, also under Liszt, and whose vocal powers were continuing to exhibit the same decline as was apparent two years earlier. &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; was performed in London in 1853 as well, but was again poorly received. Its last performances in Berlioz&#x27;s lifetime were in Weimar in 1856, this time without Beck, who had retired.

==Versions==
In 1856 the vocal score of the Weimar version was published in Germany; Choudens in 1863 issued a French edition of the same. Thomasin La May has examined the Weimar version of the opera. In 1996 a critical edition of the opera by Hugh Macdonald was published by Bärenreiter Verlag as part of the &quot;New Berlioz Edition&quot;, taking into account all three versions because the composer himself was involved in all three: 
* the original version as Berlioz composed it (&quot;Paris 1&quot;) before changes demanded by the censors; this is favored today
* the opera as premiered in 1838 (&quot;Paris 2&quot;) after changes imposed by the censors; this has no use today
* the version of the 1850s (&quot;Weimar&quot;) reflecting changes suggested by Liszt; this has three acts, is still in use, and is the basis in many reference works about the opera

==Performance history==
After Berlioz&#x27;s death occasional performances took place — in Hanover in 1879, Vienna in 1911, and as part of the inaugural season at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, for six performances from 31 March 1913 conducted by Felix Weingartner. Following &quot;Les Troyens&quot; in 1935, the Glasgow Grand Opera Society mounted &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; the next year alongside a production of &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot;; Erik Chisholm conducted. The opera was revived in Vienna in 1952, where it was recorded. Four years later the Carl Rosa Opera Company, a British touring entity, brought it into its repertoire, giving two performances to packed houses at London&#x27;s Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in 1957; the title role was sung by Charles Craig, then at the start of his career. Conductor Antal Doráti led the work in London in 1963 with Richard Lewis and Joan Carlyle, and again a recording was made. The Royal Opera House did not stage &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; until December 15, 1966, when Gedda sang the lead. The opera had its Swiss premiere in Geneva in 1964, and its first Italian performances in 1967, in Naples. 

After the first studio recording was made in July 1972, by Philips in Brent Town Hall, London, using an early two-act edition, interest in the opera grew. The first American production came in 1975 from the Opera Company of Boston under the musical direction of Sarah Caldwell, with Jon Vickers in the title role and John Reardon as Fieramosca. Stagings were mounted in Rome (1973 and 1995), Lyon (1982) and Florence (1987), among others. 

The opera&#x27;s appearance in the &quot;New Berlioz Edition&quot; in the late 1990s added to its acceptance. Indeed in the 21st century it has become a repertory work, with new productions and recordings in London and Amsterdam (1999), Berlin, Paris and New York (2003), and London, Stockholm and Salzburg (2007). It was performed in 2002 by University College Opera, an amateur student orchestra and chorus specialising in UK premieres and rarely heard operas. Those New York performances, eight of them, were the first at the Metropolitan Opera, with James Levine conducting an Andrei Șerban staging and Marcello Giordani as Cellini. The Salzburg production was conducted by Valery Gergiev and filmed. A production directed by Terry Gilliam, with the libretto in an English translation by Charles Hart, was premiered by English National Opera on 5 June 2014 with Michael Spyres in the title role and Edward Gardner conducting. Mark Elder led a staging in Amsterdam the next year, which was also filmed; John Osborn sang Cellini. Osborn again sang the role in Rome in 2016. Most recently a 2019 production in the Château de Versailles conducted by John Eliot Gardiner has been released on DVD, with Spyres as the sculptor.

== Roles ==
== Costumes ==
The costumes for the original production in 1838 were designed by Paul Lormier (1813–1895).

== Synopsis ==

:Time: three consecutive days in 1532, specifically the evening of Shrove Monday, the evening of Mardi Gras, dawn of Ash Wednesday and evening of Ash Wednesday, for the four &quot;Tableaux&quot;, respectively. 
:Place: Rome. 
:Structure: the &quot;Tableaux&quot; are numbered independently in the &quot;New Berlioz Edition&quot;; &quot;Tableaux&quot; I and II correspond to Act I while III and IV comprise Act II; in the Weimar version, which reflects changes suggested by Liszt and is the basis in many reference works about the opera, &quot;Tableaux&quot; I is Act I, &quot;Tableaux&quot; II is Act II, and &quot;Tableaux&quot; III and IV, with chunks removed, are termed Act III. 

===&quot;Tableau I (Balducci&#x27;s residence)&quot;===

Balducci has been summoned to a meeting with Pope Clement VII concerning the commission of a bronze statue of Perseus from the sculptor Benvenuto Cellini. Balducci would have preferred Fieramosca as the chosen sculptor; he also hopes to marry his daughter Teresa to Fieramosca. But Teresa is smitten with Cellini. Before Balducci goes to his meeting with the Pope, Cellini and other Carnival celebrators come on the scene, and pelt Balducci with &quot;fausses dragées&quot; (flour pellets) that make him look &quot;like a leopard&quot;. He can&#x27;t clean himself off, however, so he continues to his meeting.

A bouquet of flowers comes through the window and lands at Teresa&#x27;s feet. Attached is a note from Cellini saying that he is coming up. He does so, and explains his plan to take her away from her father so that they can live together. He and his assistant Ascanio will be disguised as monks, and will take her from her father during the Mardi Gras celebrations, when the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo cannon is sounded to mark the end of Carnival. Unbeknownst to them both, Fieramosca has also entered the room, and overhears the plan.

Upon hearing Balducci approach, Fieramosca hides in Teresa&#x27;s bedroom, and Cellini hides behind the main room door. To distract her father, Teresa invents a story about a noise in her bedroom. Balducci goes to investigate, and Cellini escapes. To Teresa&#x27;s surprise, Balducci produces Fieramosca from the bedroom. He and Teresa call on the servants and neighbors to take Fieramosca and dump him outside in the fountain, but Fieramosca breaks free of the crowd.

===&quot;Tableau II (a tavern, and then Piazza Colonna)&quot;===

Cellini, his apprentices and friends sing the praises of being goldsmiths. Bernardino asks for more wine, but the innkeeper demands settlement of their tab. Ascanio then appears with the Pope&#x27;s advance payment for the Perseus statue, but also with a warning that the casting of the statue must occur the next day. The amount of money in the advance is less than expected, which gives new impetus to the plan to mock Balducci at Cassandro&#x27;s booth that night.

Fieramosca has also overheard this plan, and confides to his friend Pompeo. Pompeo suggests that they too disguise themselves as monks and abduct Teresa themselves.

People gather in the piazza. A crowd assembles at Cassandro&#x27;s booth, where &quot;the pantomime-opera of King Midas or The Ass&#x27;s Ears&quot; is unfurled. Balducci and Teresa enter, soon after Cellini and Ascanio dressed as monks, and then Fieramosca and Pompeo similarly disguised. In the pantomime, Harlequin and Pierrot compete for the attention of King Midas, who is attired to look like Balducci. At this, the real Balducci approaches the stage, leaving Teresa alone. Both sets of &quot;friars&quot; then approach Teresa, to her confusion. The four friars begin to battle by sword, and in the struggle, Cellini fatally stabs Pompeo. The crowd becomes silent, and Cellini is arrested for murder. As he is about to be taken away, the three cannon shots from Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo are heard, indicating the end of Carnival and the start of Lent. All of the lights in the piazza are extinguished. During the darkness and resulting confusion, Cellini escapes his captors and Ascanio and Teresa go off. Fieramosca is then mistakenly arrested in Cellini&#x27;s place.

===&quot;Tableau III (Cellini&#x27;s studio)&quot;===

Ascanio and Teresa wait for Cellini in his studio. When a procession of friars passes by, they join in the prayer. Cellini then enters, still in monk&#x27;s disguise, and recounts his escape. Because he is now wanted for murder, he plans to escape Rome with Teresa, but Ascanio reminds him of his obligation to cast the statue. Ascanio goes off to find a horse. Balducci and Fieramosca then appear. Balducci denounces Cellini as a murderer and then promises Teresa to Fieramosca in marriage.

The Pope then appears to check on the progress of the statue. Cellini makes excuses, but the Pope dismisses them and decides that he will give the commission to another sculptor. Cellini then threatens to destroy the mould, and when the Pope&#x27;s guards approach him, he raises his hammer. The Pope then makes Cellini an offer: if Cellini can cast the statue that evening, he will forgive Cellini&#x27;s crimes and let him marry Teresa. But if Cellini fails, he will be hanged.
===&quot;Tableau IV (The foundry)&quot;===
After an aria from Ascanio, Cellini comes on stage and muses, in a 6/8 air, on the quiet life of a shepherd. The foundry&#x27;s smithies (&quot;fondeurs&quot;) sing a sea-shanty, which Cellini sees as a bad omen. Ascanio and Cellini encourage them to continue their work. Fieramosca arrives with henchmen and challenges Cellini to a duel, which Cellini accepts asking to settle it on the spot. But Fieramosca wants it settled elsewhere. Cellini agrees. Fieramosca and his men leave. 

Teresa arrives to see Ascanio handing Cellini his rapier. Cellini assures her he will be safe, and leaves. Alone, she hears the smithies start to lay down their tools, as they have not been paid and lack direction from Cellini. She tries to assure them they will be paid eventually, but to no avail. Fieramosca enters. Teresa faints, thinking Cellini dead. This is not so, as Fieramosca is about to offer a bribe to the smithies to cease work completely. But this turns the smithies against him, and they reassert their loyalty to Cellini, who reappears and, together with the smithies, recruits Fieramosca to help in the work. 

In the evening the Pope and Balducci enter to learn whether the statue has been completed. Fieramosca announces that they are out of metal, which Francesco and Bernardino confirm. Cellini then prays. In a sudden act he orders all works from his studio, of whatever metal, to be smelted and reused for the Perseus, much to the consternation of Francesco and Bernardino. Moments later an explosion bursts the casting and the splendid new Perseus is revealed. All acknowledge Cellini&#x27;s success, and the Pope pardons him as promised. Cellini and Teresa are united. The opera closes with a chorus of praise for the smithies.

<text>Getlink, formerly Groupe Eurotunnel, is a European public company based in Paris that manages and operates the infrastructure of the Channel Tunnel between France and the United Kingdom, operates the LeShuttle railway service, and earns revenue on other trains that operate through the tunnel (Eurostar passenger and DB Schenker freight).

Groupe Eurotunnel was established on 13 August 1986 to finance, build, and operate the Channel Tunnel under a concession granted by the French and British governments. The tunnel was constructed between 1988 and 1994 by TransManche Link (TML) under a contract issued by Groupe Eurotunnel; construction costs would overrun considerably, from TML&#x27;s original estimate of £4.7 billion to the final cost of £9.5 billion. On 6 May 1994, the completed tunnel was officially opened. Its rail infrastructure comprises of double track railway in the main tunnels, plus extensive surface-level terminal facilities at Folkestone in England and Calais in France. The rail network for operation of the Eurotunnel Shuttle train services is entirely self-contained, with connections near the two terminals to the respective national railway networks. Signalling and electric traction supply are also under Getlink control.

In 1995, a loss of £925 million was reported by Groupe Eurotunnel; this was partly due to many of the planned services to use the tunnel not yet being permitted. On 2 August 2006, following failed debt restructuring plans, Groupe Eurotunnel was placed into bankruptcy protection; a restructuring plan that involved a £2.8 billion funding arrangement and a debt-for-equity swap was approved by shareholders in May 2007. That same year, it reported a net profit of €1 million, the company&#x27;s first profitable year. In December 2009, Groupe Eurotunnel and SNCF acquired the French rail freight operator Veolia Cargo, gaining multiple subsidiaries in the process. In June 2010, the company acquired British rail freight company First GBRf for £31 million from FirstGroup. In 2012, Groupe Eurotunnel acquired three Channel ferries formerly belonging to the liquidated SeaFrance ferry service, establishing MyFerryLink to operate them, although this was discontinued due to monopoly allegations after a brief period. On 20 November 2017, Groupe Eurotunnel changed its name to Getlink. In March 2018, the Italian holding company Atlantia acquired the 15.49% stake of Goldman Sachs in Getlink, for roughly €1 billion.

==History==
===Foundation and early activity===
Getlink&#x27;s origins can be traced to the formation of &quot;Groupe Eurotunnel&quot; on 13 August 1986; it was established in accordance with the Concession Agreement of 1986 between the governments of France and the United Kingdom with the goal of financing, building and operation of a tunnel between England and France. Groupe Eurotunnel awarded a contract for the tunnel&#x27;s construction to the bi-national project organisation TransManche Link (TML). Furthermore, the company employed &quot;Maître d&#x27;Oeuvre&quot; to act as a supervisory engineering body under the terms of the concession that monitored and reported on the project.

While TML designed and built the tunnel, financing was handled by Groupe Eurotunnel; however, the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, later formalised through the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55-year operating concession, originally running from 1987; this was extended by 10 years to 65 years in 1993. Private funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale. An initial equity of £45 million was raised, then increased by £206 million private institutional placement, £770 million was raised in a public share offer that included press and television advertisements, a syndicated bank loan and letter of credit arranged £5 billion. The final cost for the tunnel&#x27;s construction came to around £9.5 billion, roughly double TML&#x27;s original estimate of £4.7 billion. This overrun has been attributed, in part, as a response to enhanced safety, security, and environmental demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 96/97&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. 2003, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Financing costs were 140% higher than forecast.

Construction of the tunnel took place between 1988 and 1994; at the peak of construction activity, roughly 15,000 people were employed while in excess of £3 million was being expended each day. On 6 May 1994, the completed tunnel was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II and President François Mitterrand, regular services commenced later that same month. In its first year of operation, Groupe Eurotunnel lost £925 million, which was attributed to disappointing revenue from both passengers and freight traffic, as well as heavy interest charges on its £8 billion of debt. The poor fiscal performance can also be partially attributed to the phased opening of the tunnel; various services awaited approval from the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, some of which did not receive permission to commence until over a year after the tunnel&#x27;s official opening date.

On 10 July 1997, a financial restructuring plan was approved by Groupe Eurotunnel&#x27;s shareholders. On 19 December, both the British and French governments officially agreed to extend its concession to 2086. On 7 April 1998, the financial restructuring process was officially completed. On 30 December 1999, as required by the Concession Agreement, Groupe Eurotunnel presented a road tunnel project to the British and French governments.

===2000s===
On 13 February 2004, Groupe Eurotunnel was granted a rail operator&#x27;s licence in France, becoming the first company ever to possess such status.

In April 2004, a dissident shareholder group led by Nicolas Miguet succeeded in taking control of Groupe Eurotunnel&#x27;s board. However, during February 2005, Jean-Louis Raymond, the Chief Executive appointed as a consequence of the boardroom coup, resigned and Jacques Gounon took complete control, becoming both Chairman and Chief Executive. During July 2006, shareholders voted on a deal that would have seen half the debt, by then reduced to £6.2 billion, exchanged for 87% of the equity. However, this plan failed, and on 2 August 2006, Groupe Eurotunnel was placed into bankruptcy protection by a French court for six months. In May 2007, a restructuring plan was approved by shareholders, whereby Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup agreed to provide £2.8 billion of long-term funding and the balance of the debt being exchanged for equity, and the shareholders agreed to waive numerous perks, such as unlimited free travel, that they had previously been entitled to.

During June 2007, the company entered into a partnership through subsidiary &quot;Europorte 2&quot; with the Port of Dunkirk relating to rail freight traffic. Under this partnership, Groupe Eurotunnel was to operate trains from Dunkirk to the Delta 3 logistics terminal at Dourges, and collaborate on container shipments to the United Kingdom, using the port of Dunkirk via the tunnel.

Following the restructuring, Groupe Eurotunnel was able to announce a small net profit of €1 million in 2007, reportedly for the first time in the company&#x27;s existence. Half-year earnings for 2008 rose to €26 million (£20.6 million), while net profit was €40 million, despite the costs associated with traffic loss from September 2008 to February 2009 following a fire in the tunnel; this allowed Eurotunnel to issue its first-ever dividend of €0.04 per euro value.

The return to financial health allowed Groupe Eurotunnel to announce, on 28 October 2009, the anticipated voluntary redemption of some of its convertible debt. By anticipating to November 2009 the reimbursement of debt due in July 2010, it aimed to issue up to 119.4 million new ordinary shares, and thus shore up its capital while reducing its debt load.

In December 2009, Groupe Eurotunnel and the French state railway operator SNCF acquired the French rail freight operator Veolia Cargo, splitting the business between them. The company took over French operations: &quot;Veolia Cargo France&quot;, &quot;Veolia Cargo Link,&quot; and &quot;CFTA Cargo&quot; are expected to be rebranded &quot;Europorte France&quot;, &quot;Europorte Link&quot; and &quot;Europorte proximity&quot; and become part of its Europorte freight business. &quot;Socorail&quot; has not been announced as being rebranded.

===2010s===
In January 2010, the Port of Dunkirk awarded Eurotunnel a seven-year concession to operate its railway system.

In June 2010, the company acquired British railfreight company First GBRf for £31 million from FirstGroup, to be merged into its Europorte subsidiary. It was rebranded GB Railfreight.

On 11 June 2012, a bid by Groupe Eurotunnel for three Channel ferries belonging to former operator SeaFrance (in liquidation) for lease to another operator was accepted, and Eurotunnel acquired the SeaFrance ferries &quot;Berlioz&quot;, &quot;Rodin&quot; and &quot;Nord Pas-de-Calais&quot;. Eurotunnel was chartered to start the MyFerryLink ferry company on 20 August 2012. After years of legal fights over accusations that Eurotunnel operating a ferry line was uncompetitive, the company stopped operating MyFerryLink on 1 July 2015.

Groupe Eurotunnel transferred its listing from the London Stock Exchange to Euronext London on 19 July 2012.

For the year 2015, statistics estimated that over 10.5 million passengers travelled on the Eurotunnel with 2,556,585 cars, 58,387 coaches and 1,483,741 goods vehicles.

On 20 November 2017, Groupe Eurotunnel changed its name to Getlink.

In March 2018, the Italian holding company Atlantia acquired the 15.49% stake of Goldman Sachs in Getlink and its 26.66% voting rights, for around €1 billion.

In June 2018, Getlink and auditor EY jointly presented a recent study on UK–Europe trade flows via the Channel Tunnel to the European Commission. Findings of this study included that, in 2016, the Channel Tunnel facilitated €138 billion of trade, believed to be roughly 26% of the total trade flows between Britain and continental Europe with an equal balance of imports and exports.

In May 2019, Getlink celebrated 25 years of operation of the Channel Tunnel with the creation of a monumental fresco by street-art artist YZ on the Tunnel&#x27;s French-side entrance.

===2020s===
In early 2020, Getlink announced the separation of the position of chairman of the supervisory board from that of chief executive officer from July 2020; accordingly, Jacques Gounon remained President and Yann Leriche became CEO. In June 2020, the company dropped its listing on the London stock exchange; it remains listed on the Euronext Paris market.

Following the Brexit vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, Getlink and subsidiary company Eurotunnel made preparations for impending border control changes. Accordingly, an additional 290 truck parking spaces at the Coquelles terminal were constructed, while all the truck controls have been grouped into a single point, the Pit-Stop. Three additional border control lanes at the Coquelles terminal and two lanes at the Folkestone were created. A smart border has been developed in collaboration with Customs and a Customs-SIVEP center to carry out additional veterinary and phytosanitary controls has been built.

SAS PARAFE, for the identity check of coach passengers, were installed on the two terminals in 2019; furthermore, 300 French and English staff were trained in administrative and customs formalities, veterinary and phytosanitary procedures, checks and document scanning, support and information for customers.

Throughout the early 21st century, French construction company Eiffage has progressively increased its stake in Getlink. During October 2022, it was announced that Eiffage has become the largest shareholder of GetLink by increasing its stake in the firm to 20.76 percent.

==Operations and services==
===Vehicle shuttle trains===

Getlink operates two types of shuttle trains that transport vehicles through the Channel Tunnel along with two terminals to support the operation of the trains. LeShuttle trains transport personal vehicles and coaches, while LeShuttle Freight transports large trucks. Operations of the LeShuttle services comprise nearly 70% of Getlink&#x27;s revenue.

===Freight train services===
Europorte operates cross channel freight trains and freight trains within France. The company was formed by the merger of Europorte 2 and Veolia Cargo&#x27;s French operations in September 2009.

===Passenger services===

Getlink hosts, but does not operate, passenger train services through the Channel Tunnel. , Eurostar is the only passenger train operator that uses the tunnel, offering services that connect the United Kingdom with France, Belgium &amp; The Netherlands.

Eurostar trains are operated by Eurostar International Limited, whose majority owner is SNCF, the national railway of France. Eurostar International is the largest customer of Getlink, which levies charges (currently £25 per passenger per return journey) for use of the tunnel.

===Electrical interconnector===
ElecLink is a 1,000 MW high-voltage direct current electrical interconnector between the UK and France, passing through the Channel Tunnel. The cable runs via the Channel Tunnel between converter stations at Peuplingues in France and Folkestone in the UK, with an additional of underground AC cable on the English side to a substation and on the French side to a substation. ElecLink commenced operations on 25 May 2022.

===Samphire Hoe===
The company also owns the small Samphire Hoe nature reserve on the coast of Kent, England, which was created from Channel Tunnel spoil during construction in the 1980s/90s. The road tunnel down, the ventilation area and the reserve itself are all owned by Eurotunnel.

=== Low cost passenger train service ===
In August 2018, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that Getlink is interested in setting up an Ouigo-style low cost high speed rail service between London and Paris, travelling between the railway stations of Stratford International and Charles-de-Gaulle. In March 2022, Getlink was reportedly examining the prospects of establishing its own rolling stock leasing company in order to lower the costs involved in operating trains through the Channel Tunnel and launching such services.

=== Regional rail ===
In September 2020, Getlink announces a partnership with RATP Dev to jointly bid under the &quot;Régionéo&quot; brand name for regional rail services in France which will gradually opened to competitive tendering.

<text>Iphigénie en Tauride (, &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;) is a 1779 opera by Christoph Willibald Gluck in four acts. It was his fifth opera for the French stage. The libretto was written by Nicolas-François Guillard.

With &quot;Iphigénie,&quot; Gluck took his operatic reform to its logical conclusion. The recitatives are shorter and they are &quot;récitatif accompagné&quot; (i.e. the strings and perhaps other instruments are playing, not just continuo accompaniment). The normal dance movements that one finds in the French &quot;tragédie en musique&quot; are almost entirely absent. The drama is ultimately based on the play &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; by the ancient Greek dramatist Euripides which deals with stories concerning the family of Agamemnon in the aftermath of the Trojan War.

==Performance history==

&quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot; was first performed on 18 May 1779 by the Paris Opéra at the second Salle du Palais-Royal and was a great success. Some think that the head of the Paris Opéra, Devismes, had attempted to stoke up the rivalry between Gluck and Niccolò Piccinni, an Italian composer also resident in the French capital, by asking them both to set an opera on the subject of Iphigenia in Tauris. In the event, Piccinni&#x27;s &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot; was not premiered until January 1781 and did not enjoy the popularity that Gluck&#x27;s work did.

In 1781 Gluck produced a German version of the opera, &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris,&quot; for the visit of the Russian Grand Duke Paul to Vienna, with the libretto translated and adapted by Johann Baptist von Alxinger in collaboration with the composer. Among the major changes was the transposition of the role of Oreste from baritone to tenor and the replacement of the final chorus of Act 2 with an instrumental movement. The revised version was the only opera Gluck wrote in German, and his last work for the stage. Styled &quot;a tragic Singspiel&quot;, it was staged on 23 October 1781 at the &quot;Nationalhoftheater&quot;, as the emperor Joseph II had had the &quot;Burgtheater&quot; renamed after dismissing the Italian singers and their orchestra in 1776 and installing German actors in the theatre. When the meagre results achieved by the new Singspiel programmes led the emperor to back down, getting an Italian opera buffa company recruited again and engaging Lorenzo Da Ponte as his theatre poet, the latter was charged to prepare an Italian translation of Gluck&#x27;s opera, which was staged in the restored &quot;Burgtheater&quot;, on 14 December 1783. According to Irish tenor Michael Kelly&#x27;s &quot;reminiscences&quot; this production, too, was personally supervised by Gluck. The German edition was revived in Berlin at the former Königliches Nationaltheater in the Gendarmenmarkt on 24 February 1795, while Da Ponte&#x27;s translation was chosen for the London first performance at the King&#x27;s Theatre on 7 April 1796. The original French version eventually proved to be one of Gluck&#x27;s most popular composition in Paris: &quot;it was billed on 35 dates in 1779, and it went on to enjoy more than four hundred representations in 1781–93, 1797–1808, 1812–18, 1821–23, 1826–28, and 1829. It was mounted at the Châtelet (1868), the Renaissance (1899), and the Opéra-Comique (1900). It was brought to the stage of the present opera house in Paris on 27 June 1931 with the aid of the Wagner Society of Amsterdam and with Pierre Monteux conducting the orchestra&quot;.

In 1889 Richard Strauss made a new German arrangement of the work for the publisher Adolph Fürstner, which was later staged in Weimar at the Hoftheater on 9 June 1900, under the Goethe-inspired title of &quot;Iphigenie auf Tauris&quot;. Strauss&#x27;s version was quite often performed at the beginning of the twentieth century and was also used for the work&#x27;s première at the Metropolitan Opera in 1916, but is by now rarely heard. It was recorded in 1961 with Montserrat Caballé in the title role, conducted by Antonio de Almeida, in performance at the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos, Lisbon. It was recently revived at the 2009 Festival della Valle d&#x27;Itria at Martina Franca.

As for the Da Ponte Italian version, there was a &quot;memorable&quot; staging at the Teatro alla Scala in 1957, with Nino Sanzogno conducting the orchestra, Luchino Visconti as the director and Maria Callas in the title role.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
Scene: &quot;The entrance hall of the temple of Diana in Tauris.&quot;

There is no overture; the opera begins with a short passage evoking calm before turning into a depiction of a great storm at sea. Iphigenia, sister of Orestes, is the high priestess of Diana in the temple of Tauris, having been transported there magically by the goddess when her father Agamemnon attempted to offer her as a sacrifice. Iphigenia and her priestesses beg the gods to protect them from the storm (&quot;Grands dieux! soyez nous secourables&quot;).

Although the storm dies down, Iphigenia remains troubled by a dream she has had, in which she envisioned her mother Clytaemnestra murdering her father, then her brother Orestes killing her mother, and finally her own hand stabbing her brother. She prays to Diana to reunite her with Orestes (&quot;Ô toi qui prolongeas mes jours&quot;). Thoas, King of Tauris, enters. He too is obsessed with dark thoughts (&quot;De noirs pressentiments&quot;): the oracles, he tells her, predict doom for him if a single stranger escapes with his life. (The custom of the Scythians, who inhabit Tauris, is to ritually sacrifice any who are shipwrecked on their shores).

A chorus of Scythians comes bringing news of two young Greeks who have just been found shipwrecked, demanding their blood (&quot;Il nous fallait du sang&quot;). After Iphigenia and the priestesses depart, Thoas brings in the Greeks, who turn out to be Orestes and his friend Pylades. After asking them for what purpose they came (they have come to retrieve Diana&#x27;s statue and return it to Greece, though they do not divulge this), Thoas promises them death and has them taken away.

===Act 2===
Scene: &quot;An inner chamber of the temple&quot;

Orestes and Pylades languish in chains. Orestes berates himself for causing the death of his dear friend (&quot;Dieux qui me poursuivez&quot;), but Pylades assures him that he does not feel dispirited because they will die united (&quot;Unis dès la plus tendre enfance&quot;). A minister of the sanctuary comes to remove Pylades. Orestes half falls asleep (&quot;Le calme rentre dans mon coeur&quot;), but he is tormented by visions of the Furies, who wish to avenge his slaying of his mother (whom Orestes killed for murdering his father Agamemnon).

Iphigenia enters and, although the two do not recognize each other, Orestes sees an astonishing likeness between her and the slain Clytaemnestra seen in his dream. She questions him further, asking him the fate of Agamemnon and all Greece, and he tells her of Agamemnon&#x27;s murder by his wife, and the wife&#x27;s murder by her son. In agitation, she asks of the fate of the son, and Orestes says that the son found the death he had long sought, and that only their sister Electra remains alive. Iphigenia sends Orestes away and with her priestesses laments the destruction of her country and the supposed death of her brother (&quot;Ô malheureuse Iphigénie&quot;). She and the priestesses perform a funeral ceremony for Orestes (&quot;Contemplez ces tristes apprêts&quot;).

===Act 3===
Scene: &quot;Iphigenia&#x27;s chamber&quot;

Iphigenia is drawn to the stranger who reminds her of her brother Orestes (&quot;D&#x27;une image, hélas! trop chérie&quot;). She tells Orestes and Pylades she can persuade Thoas to save one of them from the sacrifice (&quot;Je pourrais du tyran tromper la barbarie&quot;) and asks the one who is spared to carry word of her fate to her sister Electra in Argos. Both men readily agree, and Iphigenia chooses Orestes to survive.

But on her exit, Orestes insists that Pylades agree to switch places with him as Orestes cannot bear the thought of his friend&#x27;s death and sees dying as an escape from his own madness; Pylades, on the contrary, is glad at the thought of dying so Orestes can live (Duet: &quot;Et tu prétends encore que tu m&#x27;aimes&quot; and aria for Pylades: &quot;Ah! mon ami, j&#x27;implore ta pitié!&quot;). When Iphigenia returns, Orestes insists that she reverse her decision, threatening to kill himself before her eyes if she does not. Reluctantly, she agrees to spare Pylades instead and sends him to carry her message to Electra. Everyone but Pylades departs, and he closes the act by promising to do everything possible to save Orestes (&quot;Divinité des grandes âmes!&quot;).

===Act 4===
Scene: &quot;Inside the temple of Diana&quot;

Iphigenia wonders how she can ever carry out the killing of Orestes, since somehow her soul shrinks from the thought of it. She asks the goddess Diana to help her steel herself for the task (&quot;Je t&#x27;implore et je tremble&quot;). The priestesses bring in Orestes, who has been prepared for sacrifice (Chorus: &quot;Ô Diane, sois nous propice&quot;). He tells her not to lament him, but to strike, telling her it is the will of the gods. The priestesses sing a hymn to Diana as they lead Orestes to the altar (Chorus: &quot;Chaste fille de Latone&quot;). While she wields the knife, Orestes exclaims Iphigenia&#x27;s name, leading her and the priestesses to recognize him and stop the ritual slaughter.

The happy reunion of sister and brother is cut short at news that Thoas is coming, having heard that one of the captives was released and intent on the blood of the other. The king enters wildly, ordering his guards to seize Orestes and promising to sacrifice both him and his sister. At that moment Pylades enters with a band of Greeks, cutting down Thoas where he stands.

The resulting rout of the Scythians by the Greeks is halted by a &quot;dea ex machina&quot; appearance of Diana, who commands the Scythians to restore her statue to Greece (&quot;Arrêtez! Écoutez mes décrets éternels&quot;). She also issues pardon to Orestes for murdering his mother, sending him to be king over Mycenae and bidding him restore Iphigenia to her country. As Diana is carried back into the clouds, everyone sings a concluding chorus of rejoicing at having the favor of earth and heaven restored to them (&quot;Les dieux, longtemps en courroux&quot;).

==Libretto==

The ultimate source of the drama was Euripides&#x27; tragedy &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;. Because of its simplicity and heroic themes this work had a particular appeal for 18th-century proponents of Neo-classicism and there were several dramatic versions in the late 1700s, the most famous of which is Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Iphigenie auf Tauris&quot; (1787). However, the most important as far as Gluck is concerned – because it formed the basis of Guillard&#x27;s libretto – is Guimond de la Touche&#x27;s spoken tragedy, which premiered in Paris on 4 June 1757. De la Touche&#x27;s play was such a success that it was transferred to Vienna in 1761. It contributed to a vogue for the Tauris story in the city. In 1763 a &quot;reform opera&quot; on the subject by Tommaso Traetta with a libretto by Marco Coltellini, &quot;Ifigenia in Tauride&quot;, appeared on the Viennese stage. Coltellini&#x27;s and Traetta&#x27;s ideas on how to reform opera were similar to Gluck&#x27;s and Gluck himself conducted the work in 1767. Gluck may have wanted to compose his own reform opera on the Tauris theme but Traetta&#x27;s opera made this impossible for the time being. Instead, in 1765 Gluck composed a ballet, &quot;Sémiramis&quot;, which has many points in common with it and he reused some of the music from &quot;Sémiramis&quot; in &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;.

It was only after he moved to Paris that Gluck finally had the opportunity to set the Tauris story and then only after he had composed another opera on the Iphigenia theme, &quot;Iphigénie en Aulide&quot; (1774). Beginning work in 1778, Gluck collaborated closely with the young poet Nicolas-François Guillard, who based his libretto on Guimond de la Touche&#x27;s play. De la Touche&#x27;s work had been praised for its simplicity, but Gluck and his librettist simplified the drama even further. Their main innovations were to begin the opera with a storm (which would have been more difficult in a spoken drama) and to delay the recognition until the finale.

&quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot; was an innovative libretto in the history of opera. Michael Ewans has commented, &quot;Gluck&#x27;s most radical &#x27;reform opera&#x27; even dispenses with a love interest. Romantic interest is peripheral to Greek drama, but &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;, &#x27;the first opera without love to exist in our theatres&#x27; must be one of the few major operas to forego the theme altogether.&quot;

==Music==
===Gluck&#x27;s borrowings===
The borrowings Gluck made in this, his last significant opera, are numerous, and many scholars feel that they constitute a &quot;summing up&quot; of the artistic ideals he pursued throughout his career as a composer. Recycling music was common practice among 18th century composers. Gluck knew that his earlier Italian-language operas and the ballets and &quot;opéras comiques&quot; he had written for Vienna were never likely to be played again, whereas the French had a tradition of keeping successful operas in the repertory. Recycling was thus a way of saving some of his most outstanding musical ideas. Most of the reused music is Gluck&#x27;s own, culled from his earlier operas or from his ballet &quot;Sémiramis&quot;. In at least one case, however, an aria in &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot; is actually Gluck borrowing from himself borrowing from Johann Sebastian Bach. This is a complete list of Gluck&#x27;s borrowings:

*Introduction: Overture from &quot;L&#x27;île de Merlin&quot;, featuring a storm followed by a calm. Gluck&#x27;s major innovation was to reverse the order of the movements so the opera opens with the calm which then turns into a storm (&quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot; has no overture as such).
*Aria &quot;Dieux qui me poursuivez&quot; from &quot;Telemaco&quot; (Aria:&quot;Non dirmi ch&#x27;io&quot;)
*Music for the Furies in act 2 from the ballet &quot;Sémiramis&quot;
*Act 2 aria &quot;O malheureuse Iphigénie&quot; from &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; (Aria: &quot;Se mai senti spirarti sul volto&quot;)
*Act 2 chorus: &quot;Contemplez ces tristes apprêts&quot; from the middle section of the same aria
*Aria &quot;Je t&#x27;implore et je tremble&quot;, inspired (consciously or unconsciously) by the gigue of the Partita no. 1 in B Flat (BWV 825) by Bach, originally appeared as the aria &quot;Perchè, se tanti siete&quot; in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Antigono&quot;
*Some music in the climactic final scene of act 4 was taken from &quot;Sémiramis&quot;
*Final chorus (&quot;Les dieux, longtemps en courroux&quot;) from &quot;Paride ed Elena&quot; (Chorus: &quot;Vieni al mar&quot;)

===Innovative features===
Unusually for a French opera, &quot;Iphigénie&quot; contains only one short &quot;divertissement&quot; (an opportunity for dance and spectacle): the chorus and dance of the Scythians in the &quot;Turkish&quot; style at the end of the first act. This was so out of the ordinary that, after the first five performances, with Gluck&#x27;s acquiescence, the authorities of the Paris Opéra added ballet music by François-Joseph Gossec to the finale, with Jean-Georges Noverre&#x27;s choreography. Which was commented upon as follows in the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot;:
The opera contains &quot;Gluck&#x27;s most famous piece of psychological instrumentation&quot;, &quot;Le calme rentre dans mon cœur&quot;. As Donald Grout describes it: &quot;Orestes, left alone after Pylades has been arrested by the temple guards, falls into a half stupor; in pitiable self-delusion he tries to encourage the feeling of peace that descends on him momentarily, singing &quot;Le calme rentre dans mon cœur&quot;. But the accompaniment, with a subdued, agitated, sixteenth-note reiteration of one tone, and with a sforzando accent at the first beat of every measure, betrays the troubled state of his mind, from which he cannot banish the pangs of remorse for his past crime. It is perhaps the first occurrence in opera of this device of using the orchestra to reveal the inward truth of a situation, in distinction from, even in contradiction to, the words of the text – a practice that Richard Wagner was later to incorporate into a complete system.&quot; When a critic complained about the contradiction between Orestes&#x27; words and the musical accompaniment, Gluck replied: &quot;He&#x27;s lying: he killed his mother.&quot;

<text>Tulum (, ) is the site of a pre-Columbian Mayan walled city which served as a major port for Coba, in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. The ruins are situated on cliffs along the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on the Caribbean Sea. Tulum was one of the last cities built and inhabited by the Maya and achieved its greatest prominence between the 13th and 15th centuries. Maya continued to occupy Tulum for about 70 years after the Spanish began occupying Mexico, but the city was abandoned by the end of the 16th century. Tulum is one of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites, and today it is a popular site for tourists.

==History and description==
The site might have been called Zama, meaning &quot;City of Dawn,&quot; because it faces the sunrise. Tulum stands on a bluff facing east toward the Caribbean Sea. &quot;Tulúm&quot; is also the Yucatán Mayan word for &quot;fence&quot;, &quot;wall&quot; or &quot;trench.&quot; The walls surrounding the site allowed the Tulum fort to be defended against invasions. Tulum had access to both land and sea trade routes, making it an important trade hub, especially for obsidian. From numerous depictions in murals and other works around the site, Tulum appears to have been an important site for the worship of the Diving or Descending god.

Tulum was first mentioned by Juan Díaz, a member of Juan de Grijalva&#x27;s Spanish expedition of 1518, the first Europeans to spot Tulum. The first detailed description of the ruins was published by John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood in 1843 in the book &quot;Incidents of Travel in Yucatan&quot;. As they arrived from the sea, Stephens and Catherwood first saw a tall building that impressed them greatly, most likely the great Castillo of the site. They made accurate maps of the site&#x27;s walls, and Catherwood made sketches of the Castillo and several other buildings. Stephens and Catherwood also reported an early classic stele at the site, with an inscribed date of AD 564 (now in the British Museum&#x27;s collection). This has been interpreted as meaning that the stele was likely built elsewhere and brought to Tulum to be reused.

Work conducted at Tulum continued with that of Sylvanus Morley and George P. Howe, beginning in 1913. They worked to restore and open the public beaches. The work was continued by the Carnegie Institution from 1916 to 1922, Samuel Lothrop in 1924 who also mapped the site, Miguel Ángel Fernández in the late 1930s and early 1940s, William Sanders in 1956, and then later in the 1970s by Arthur G. Miller. Through these later investigations done by Sanders and Miller, it has been determined that Tulum was occupied during the late Postclassic period around AD 1200. The site continued to be occupied until contact with the Spanish was made in the early 16th century. The site was abandoned by the end of the 16th century.

In 2016, an underwater archaeological expedition led by Jerónimo Avilés exploring the cenote cave system discovered the skeleton of a female about 30 years of age that may be at least 9,900 years old. According to craniometric measurements, the skull is believed to conform to the mesocephalic pattern, like the other three skulls found in Tulum caves. Three different scars on the skull of the woman showed that she was hit with something hard and her skull bones were broken. Her skull also had crater-like deformations and tissue deformities that appeared to be caused by a bacterial relative of syphilis.

According to study lead researcher Wolfgang Stinnesbeck, &quot;It really looks as if this woman had a very hard time and an extremely unhappy end of her life. Obviously, this is speculative, but given the traumas and the pathological deformations on her skull, it appears a likely scenario that she may have been expelled from her group and was killed in the cave, or was left in the cave to die there”.

The newly discovered skeleton was 140 meters away from the Chan Hol 2 site. Although archeologists assumed the divers found the remains of the missing Chan Hol 2, the analysis proved that these assumptions were erroneous in a short time. Stinnesbeck compared the new bones to old photographs of Chan Hol 2 and showed that the two skeletons represent different individuals.

Due to their distinctive features, study co-researcher Samuel Rennie suggest the existence of at least two morphologically diverse groups of people living separately in Mexico during the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene.

==Architecture==

Tulum has architecture typical of Maya sites on the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. This architecture is recognized by a step running around the base of the building, which sits on a low substructure. Doorways of this type are usually narrow, with columns used as support if the building is big enough. As the walls flare out there are usually two sets of molding near the top. The room usually contains one or two small windows with an altar at the back wall, roofed by either a beam-and-rubble ceiling or being vaulted. This type of architecture resembles what can be found in the nearby Chichen Itza, just on a much smaller scale.

=== Tulum&#x27;s wall ===

Tulum was protected on one side by steep sea cliffs and on the landward side by a wall that averaged about in height. The wall also was about thick and long on the side parallel to the sea. The part of the wall that ran the width of the site was slightly shorter and only about on both sides. Constructing this massive wall would have taken an enormous amount of energy and time, which shows how important defense was to the Maya when they chose this site. On the southwest and northwest corners there are small structures that have been identified as watch towers, showing again how well defended the city was. There are five narrow gateways in the wall with two each on the north and south sides and one on the west. The seaward side is protected by the steep cliffs, except for one small cove with a sandy beach. It was in this small cove where the canoes would return from trading and fishing. Near the northern side of the wall a small cenote provided the city with fresh water. It is this impressive wall that makes Tulum one of the most well-known fortified sites of the Maya.

=== Most famous buildings ===
There are three major structures of interest at the Tulum archeological site. El Castillo, the Temple of the Frescoes, and the Temple of the Descending God.

==== Temple of the Frescoes ====
Among the more spectacular buildings here is the Temple of the Frescoes that included a lower gallery and a smaller second story gallery. The Temple of the Frescoes was used as an observatory for tracking the movements of the sun. Niched figurines of the Maya &quot;diving god&quot; or Venus deity decorate the facade of the temple. This &quot;diving god&quot; is also depicted in the Temple of the Diving God in the central precinct of the site. Above the entrance in the western wall a stucco figure of the &quot;diving god&quot; is still preserved, giving the temple its name. A mural can still be seen on the eastern wall that resembles that of a style that originated in highland Mexico, called the Mixteca-Puebla style, though visitors are no longer permitted to enter.
==== Temple of the Descending God ====
The Temple of the Descending God consists of a single room with a door to the west and a narrow staircase that was built on top of another temple that served as its base.

In the niche located at the top of the door stands a sculpture that&#x27;s found throughout Tulum. He has wings, a headdress, and holds an object in his hands.

==== El Castillo ====
Also in the central precinct is the pyramid, which is tall. The Castillo was built on a previous building that was colonnaded and had a beam and mortar roof. The lintels in the upper rooms have serpent motifs carved into them. The construction of the Castillo appears to have taken place in stages. A small shrine appears to have been used as a beacon for incoming canoes. This shrine marks a break in the barrier reef that is opposite the site. Here there is a cove and landing beach in a break in the sea cliffs that would have been perfect for trading canoes coming in. This characteristic of the site may be one of the reasons the Maya founded the city of Tulum exactly here, as Tulum later became a prominent trading port during the late Postclassic.

==Trading==

Both coastal and land routes converged at Tulum. A number of artifacts found in or near the site show contacts with areas all over Central Mexico and Central America. Copper artifacts from the Mexican highlands have been found near the site, as have flint artifacts, ceramics, incense burners, and gold objects from all over the Yucatán. Salt and textiles were among some of the goods brought by traders to Tulum by sea that would be dispersed inland. Typical exported goods included feathers and copper objects that came from inland sources. These goods could be transported by sea to rivers such as the Río Motagua and the Río Usumacincta/Pasión system, which could be traveled inland, giving seafaring canoes access to both the highlands and the lowlands.

The Río Motagua starts from the highlands of Guatemala and empties into the Caribbean. The Río Pasión/Ucamacincta river system also originates in the Guatemalan highlands and empties into the Gulf of Mexico. It may have been one of these seafaring canoes that Christopher Columbus first encountered off the shores of the Bay Islands of Honduras. Jade and obsidian appear to be some of the more valuable found here. The obsidian would have been brought from Ixtepeque in northern Guatemala, which was nearly away from Tulum. This huge distance, coupled with the density of obsidian found at the site, show that Tulum was a major center for the trading of obsidian.

==Tourism==

Tulum archaeological site is relatively compact compared with many other Maya sites in the vicinity, and is one of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites. Its proximity to the modern tourism developments along the Mexican Caribbean coastline and its short distance from Cancún and the surrounding &quot;Riviera Maya&quot; has made it a popular Maya tourist site in the Yucatán Península. Daily tour buses bring a constant stream of visitors to the site. The Tulum ruins are the third most-visited archeological site in Mexico, after Teotihuacan and Chichen Itza, receiving over 2.2 million visitors in 2017.

A large number of cenotes are located in the Tulum area such as Maya Blue, Naharon, Temple of Doom, Tortuga, Vacaha, Grand Cenote, Abejas, Nohoch Kiin, Calavera,and Zacil-Ha.

Tulum has some of the best beaches in Mexico. Most popular beaches in Tulum are Playa Paraiso, Playa Ruinas, Playa Akumal, Papaya Playa and more. CV Villas researchers named Tulum beaches with the whitest sand, 1.4 points off the whitest shade from over 200 beaches worldwide.

The tourist destination is now divided into six main areas: the archeological site, the &quot;Pueblo&quot; (or town), the &quot;Zona Hotelera&quot; (or hotel zone along the seafront), &quot;Aldea Zama&quot; (south of Pueblo), &quot;La Veleta&quot; (south-west of Pueblo), and the biosphere reserve of Sian Ka&#x27;an.

The impact of tourism on Tulum is a subject of growing controversy. Director Rachel Appel filmed a documentary entitled &quot;The Dark Side of Tulum&quot; in 2018 as an exposé of the environmental impacts of the local tourist industry.

== Safety ==
According to the crime statistics provided by Numbeo, Tulum is considered a safe destination for most tourists. The primary safety concerns in the area typically revolve around natural occurrences such as hurricanes during the months of June to October.

==Climate==
Considered a tropical savanna climate typically with a pronounced dry season. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Aw&quot; (Tropical Savanna Climate).

<doc id="355341" wikidata="Q682601" url="?curid=355341" title="Caerphilly Castle">
<text>Caerphilly Castle () is a medieval fortification in Caerphilly in South Wales. The castle was constructed by Gilbert de Clare in the 13th century as part of his campaign to maintain control of Glamorgan, and saw extensive fighting between Gilbert, his descendants, and the native Welsh rulers. Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes – considered by historian Allen Brown to be &quot;the most elaborate water defences in all Britain&quot; – it occupies around and is the largest castle in Wales and the second-largest castle in the United Kingdom after Windsor Castle. It is famous for having introduced concentric castle defences to Britain and for its large gatehouses. Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was opposed by Gilbert&#x27;s Welsh rival Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, leading to the site being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271. Despite these interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle&#x27;s luxurious accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at Kenilworth. The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired Edward I&#x27;s castles in North Wales, and proved what historian Norman Pounds has termed &quot;a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain&quot;.

The castle was attacked during the Madog ap Llywelyn revolt of 1294, the Llywelyn Bren uprising in 1316 and during the overthrow of Edward II in 1326–27. In the late 15th century, however, it fell into decline and by the 16th century the lakes had drained away and the walls were robbed of their stone. The Marquesses of Bute acquired the property in 1776 and under the third and fourth Marquesses extensive restoration took place. In 1950 the castle and grounds were given to the state and the water defences were re-flooded. In the 21st century, the Welsh heritage agency Cadw manages the site as a tourist attraction.

==History==

===13th century===
Caerphilly Castle was built in the second half of the 13th century, as part of the Anglo-Norman expansion into South Wales. The Normans began to make incursions into Wales from the late 1060s onwards, pushing westwards from their bases in recently occupied England. Their advance was marked by the construction of castles and the creation of regional lordships. The task of subduing the region of Glamorgan was given to the earls of Gloucester in 1093; efforts continued throughout the 12th and early 13th centuries, accompanied by extensive fighting between the Anglo-Norman lords and local Welsh rulers. The powerful de Clare family acquired the earldom in 1217 and continued to attempt to conquer the whole of the Glamorgan region.
In 1263, Gilbert de Clare, also known as &quot;Red Gilbert&quot; because of the colour of his hair, inherited the family lands. Opposing him in Glamorgan was the native Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. Llywelyn had taken advantage of the chaos of the civil war in England between Henry III and rebel barons during the 1260s to expand his power across the region. In 1265 Llywelyn allied himself with the baronial faction in England in exchange for being granted authority over the local Welsh magnates across all the territories in the region, including Glamorgan. De Clare believed his lands and power were under threat and allied himself with Henry III against the rebel barons and Llywelyn.

The baronial revolt was crushed between 1266 and 1267, leaving de Clare free to advance north into Glamorgan from his main base in Cardiff. De Clare started to construct a castle at Caerphilly to control his new gains in 1268. The castle lay in a basin of the Rhymney Valley, alongside the Rhymney River and at the heart of network of paths and roads, adjacent to a former Roman fort. Work began at a huge pace, with ditches cut to form the basic shape of the castle, temporary wooden palisades erected and extensive water defences created by damming a local stream. The walls and internal buildings were built at speed, forming the main part of the castle. The architect of the castle and the precise cost of the construction are unknown, but modern estimates suggest that it could have cost as much as castles such as Conwy or Caernarfon, perhaps as much as £19,000, a huge sum for the period.

Llywelyn responded by intervening with his own forces but outright conflict was prevented by the diplomatic efforts of Henry III. De Clare continued building work and in 1270 Llywelyn responded by attacking and burning the site, probably destroying the temporary defences and stores. De Clare began work again the following year, raising tensions and prompting Henry to send two bishops, Roger de Meyland and Godfrey Giffard, to take control of the site and arbitrate a solution to the dispute.
The bishops took possession of the castle later in 1271 and promised Llywelyn that building work would temporarily cease and that negotiations would begin the following summer. In February of the next year, however, de Clare&#x27;s men seized back the castle, threw out the bishops&#x27; soldiers, and de Clare – protesting his innocence in these events – began work once again. Neither Henry nor Llywelyn could readily intervene and de Clare was able to lay claim to the whole of Glamorgan. Work on the castle continued, with additional water defences, towers and gatehouses added.

Llywelyn&#x27;s power declined over the next two decades. In 1277 Henry&#x27;s son, Edward I, invaded Wales following a dispute with the prince, breaking his power in South Wales, and in 1282 Edward&#x27;s second campaign resulted in Llywelyn&#x27;s death and the collapse of independent Welsh rule. Further defences were added to the walls until work stopped around 1290. Local disputes remained. De Clare argued with Humphrey de Bohun, the earl of Hereford, in 1290 and the following year the case was brought before the king, resulting in the temporary royal seizure of Caerphilly.

In 1294 Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule, the first major insurrection since the 1282 campaign. The Welsh appear to have risen up over the introduction of taxation and Madog had considerable popular support. In Glamorgan, Morgan ap Maredudd led the local uprising; Morgan had been dispossessed by de Clare in 1270 and saw this as a chance to regain his lands. Morgan attacked Caerphilly, burning half of the town, but failed to take the castle. In the spring of 1295 Edward pressed home a counter-attack in North Wales, putting down the uprising and arresting Madog. De Clare attacked Morgan&#x27;s forces and retook the region between April and May, resulting in Morgan&#x27;s surrender. De Clare died at the end of 1295, leaving Caerphilly Castle in a good condition, linked to the small town of Caerphilly which had emerged to the south of it and a large deer park in the nearby Aber Valley.

===14th – 17th centuries===

Gilbert&#x27;s son, also called Gilbert de Clare, inherited the castle, but he died fighting at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314 while still quite young. The family&#x27;s lands were initially placed under the control of the Crown, but before any decision could be taken on the inheritance, a revolt broke out in Glamorgan. Anger over the actions of the royal administrators caused Llywelyn Bren to rise up in January 1316, attacking Caerphilly Castle with a large force of men. The castle withstood the attack, but the town was destroyed and the rebellion spread. A royal army was despatched to deal with the situation, defeating Bren in a battle at Caerphilly Mountain and breaking the Welsh siege of the castle.

In 1317 Edward II settled the inheritance of Glamorgan and Caerphilly Castle on Eleanor de Clare, who had married the royal favourite, Hugh le Despenser. Hugh used his relationship with the king to expand his power across the region, taking over lands throughout South Wales. Hugh employed Master Thomas de la Bataile and William Hurley to expand the Great Hall at the castle in 1325–1326, including richly carved windows and doors. In 1326, however, Edward&#x27;s wife, Isabella of France, overthrew his government, forcing the king and Hugh to flee west. The pair stayed in Caerphilly Castle at the end of October and early November, before leaving to escape Isabella&#x27;s approaching forces, abandoning the extensive stores and £14,000 held at the castle. William la Zouche besieged the castle with a force of 425 soldiers, cornering the constable, Sir John de Felton, Hugh&#x27;s son – also called Hugh – and the garrison of 130 men inside. Caerphilly held out until March 1327, when the garrison surrendered on the condition that the younger Hugh was pardoned, his father having been already executed.
Tensions between the Welsh and the English persisted and spilled over in 1400 with the outbreak of the Glyndŵr Rising. It is uncertain what part the castle played in the conflict, but it seems to have survived intact. It was captured by the forces of Glyndwr during the rebellions. In 1416, the castle passed through Isabel le Despenser in marriage to her first husband Richard de Beauchamp, the earl of Worcester, and then to her second husband, Richard Beauchamp, the earl of Warwick. Isabel and her second husband invested heavily in the castle, conducting repairs and making it suitable for use as their main residence in the region. The castle passed to Richard Neville in 1449 and to Jasper Tudor, the earl of Pembroke, in 1486.

After 1486, the castle went into decline, eclipsed by the more fashionable residence of Cardiff Castle; once the sluice-gates fell into disrepair, the water defences probably drained away. Antiquarian John Leland visited Caerphilly Castle around 1539, and described it as having &quot;waulles of a wonderful thiknes&quot;, but beyond a tower used to hold prisoners it was in ruins and surrounded by marshland. Henry Herbert, the earl of Pembroke used the castle for his manorial court. In 1583 the castle was leased to Thomas Lewis, who stripped it of much of its stone to extend his house, causing extensive damage.

In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament. South Wales was predominantly Royalist in sympathy, and during the conflict, a sconce, or small fort, was built overlooking Caerphilly Castle to the north-west, on the site of the old Roman fort. It is uncertain if this was built by Royalist forces or by the Parliamentary army that occupied the area during the final months of the war in March 1646, but the fort&#x27;s guns would have dominated the interior of the castle. It is also uncertain whether or not Caerphilly Castle was deliberately slighted by Parliament to prevent its future use as a fortification. Although several towers had collapsed by the 18th century, possibly as a result of such an operation, it is probable that this deterioration was actually the result of subsidence damage caused when the water defences retreated, as there is no evidence of deliberate destruction having been ordered.

===18th – 21st centuries===

The Marquesses of Bute acquired the castle in 1776. John Stuart, the first marquess, took steps to protect the ruins. His great-grandson John Crichton-Stuart, the third marquess, was immensely rich as the result of the family&#x27;s holdings in the South Wales coalfields and was passionately interested in the medieval period. He had the site fully surveyed by the architect William Frame, and reroofed the great hall in the 1870s. The marquess began a process of buying back leasehold properties around the castle with the intent of clearing back the town houses that had been built up to the edge of the site.
The fourth marquess, John Crichton-Stuart, was an enthusiastic restorer and builder and commissioned a major restoration project between 1928 and 1939. The stonework was carefully repaired, with moulds made to recreate missing pieces. The Inner East Gatehouse was rebuilt, along with several of the other towers. The marquess carried out landscaping work, with the intent of eventually re-flooding the lakes, and thanks to several decades of purchases was finally able to demolish the local houses encroaching on the view of the castle.

By 1947, when John Crichton-Stuart, the fifth marquess, inherited the castle, the Bute family had divested itself of most of its land in South Wales. John sold off the family&#x27;s remaining property interests and in 1950 he gave Caerphilly Castle to the state. The lakes were re-flooded and the final stages of the restoration work were completed in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 21st century the castle is managed by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw as a tourist attraction. In 2006, the castle saw 90,914 visitors. It is protected as a scheduled monument and as a grade I listed building. The Great Hall is available for wedding ceremonies.

==Architecture==

Caerphilly Castle comprises a set of eastern defences, protected by the Outer East Moat and the North Lake, and fortifications on the Central Island and the Western Island, both protected by the South Lake. The site is around in size, making it the second largest in Britain. It is constructed on a natural gravel bank in the local river basin, and the castle walls are built from Pennant sandstone. The castle&#x27;s architecture is famous and historically significant. The castle introduced concentric castle defences to Britain, changing the future course of the country&#x27;s military architecture, and also incorporated a huge gatehouse. The castle also featured a sophisticated network of moats and dams, considered by historian Allen Brown to be &quot;the most elaborate water defences in all Britain&quot;.

The eastern defences were reached via the Outer Main Gatehouse, which featured circular towers resting on spurred, pyramidic bases, a design particular to South Wales castles. Originally the gatehouse would have been reached over a sequence of two drawbridges, linked by an intervening tower, since destroyed. To the north side of the gatehouse was the North Dam, protected by three substantial towers, and which may have supported the castle&#x27;s stables. Despite subsidence damage, the dam still holds back the North Lake. The South Dam was a massive structure, long, ending in a huge buttressed wall. The remains of the castle mill – originally powered by water from the dam – survive. Four replica siege engines have been placed on display. The dam ended in Felton&#x27;s Tower, a square fortification designed to protect the sluicegates regulating the water levels of the dam, and the South Gatehouse – also called Giffard&#x27;s Tower – originally accessed via a drawbridge, which led into the town.

Caerphilly&#x27;s water defences were almost certainly inspired by those at Kenilworth, where a similar set of artificial lakes and dams was created. Gilbert de Clare had fought at the siege of Kenilworth in 1266 and would have seen these at first hand. Caerphilly&#x27;s water defences provided particular protection against mining, which could otherwise undermine castle walls during the period, and are considered the most advanced of their kind in Britain.

The central island held Caerphilly&#x27;s inner defences, a roughly square design with a walled inner and middle ward, the inner ward protected by four turrets on each of the corners. The walls of the inner ward overlooked those of the middle ward, producing a concentric defence of two enclosed rings of walls; in the medieval period, the walls of the middle ward would have been much higher than today, forming a more substantial defence. Caerphilly was the first concentric castle in Britain, pre-dating Edward I&#x27;s famous programme of concentric castles by a few years. The design influenced the design of Edward&#x27;s later castles in North Wales, and historian Norman Pounds considers it &quot;a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain&quot;. Probable subsidence has caused the south-east tower in the Inner Ward to lean outwards at an angle of 10 degrees.
Access to the central island occurred over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle&#x27;s Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if the perimeter of the castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped on a grand scale, probably for the use of the castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.

Inside the inner ward was the castle&#x27;s Great Hall and accommodation. Caerphilly was built with fashionable, high-status accommodation, similar to that built around the same time in Chepstow Castle. In the medieval period the Great Hall would have been subdivided with wooden screens, colourful decorations, with rich, detailed carving and warmed by a large, central fireplace. Some carved medieval corbels in the shape of male and female heads survive in the hall today, possibly depicting the royal court in the 1320s, including Edward II, Isabella of France, Hugh Despenser and Eleanor de Clare. To the east of the Great Hall was the castle chapel, positioned above the buttery and pantry. On the west side of the hall were the castle&#x27;s private apartments, two solar blocks with luxurious fittings.

Beyond the central island was the Western Island, probably reached by drawbridges. The island is called &quot;Y Weringaer&quot; or &quot;Caer y Werin&quot; in Welsh, meaning &quot;the people&#x27;s fort&quot;, and may have been used by the town of Caerphilly for protection during conflicts. On the north-west side of the Western Island was the site of the former Roman fort, enclosing around , and the remains of the 17th-century civil-war fortification built on the same location.

==In popular culture==
The long-running British television show &quot;Doctor Who&quot; chose Caerphilly Castle as a filming location for several episodes, including &quot;The End of Time&quot; in 2009, &quot;The Vampires in Venice&quot; in 2010, two parter &quot;The Rebel Flesh&quot; and &quot;The Almost People&quot; in 2011; “Robot of Sherwood&quot; in 2014 and “Heaven Sent” in 2015. For &quot;The End of Time&quot;, producers used the residential quarters of the East Gatehouse, Constable&#x27;s Hall and Braose Gallery for the filming of a dungeon in the fictional Broadfell Prison.

<text>A skill is the learned or innate 
ability to act with determined results with good execution often within a given amount of time, energy, or both.
Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills. Some examples of general skills include time management, teamwork
and leadership,
and self-motivation.
In contrast, domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job, e.g. operating a sand blaster. Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.

A skill may be called an art when it represents a body of knowledge or branch of learning, as in &quot;the art of medicine&quot; or &quot;the art of war&quot;. Although the arts are also skills, there are many skills that form an art but have no connection to the fine arts.

People need a broad range of skills to contribute to the modern economy. A joint ASTD and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing, and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it. Three broad categories of skills are suggested: technical, human, and conceptual. The first two can be substituted with hard and soft skills, respectively.

==Hard skills==
Hard skills, also called technical skills, are any skills relating to a specific task or situation. It involves both understanding and proficiency in such specific activity that involves methods, processes, procedures, or techniques. These skills are easily quantifiable unlike soft skills, which are related to one&#x27;s personality. These are also skills that can be or have been tested and may entail some professional, technical, or academic qualification.

== Holistic competency ==
Holistic competencies is an umbrella term for different types of generic skills (e.g., critical thinking, problem-solving skills, positive values, and attitudes (e.g., resilience, appreciation for others) which are essential for life-long learning and whole-person development.

==Labor skills==

Skilled workers have long had historical import (&quot;see&quot; division of labour) as electricians, masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, bakers, brewers, coopers, printers and other occupations that are economically productive. Skilled workers were often politically active through their craft guilds.

==Life skills==

An ability and capacity acquired through deliberate, systematic, and sustained effort to smoothly and adaptively carry out complex activities or job functions involving ideas (cognitive skills), things (technical skills), and/or people (interpersonal skills).
==People skills==

According to the &quot;Portland Business Journal&quot;, people skills are described as: 
* understanding ourselves and moderating our responses
* talking effectively and empathizing accurately
* building relationships of trust, respect and productive interactions.

A British definition is &quot;the ability to communicate effectively with people in a friendly way, especially in business.&quot; The term is already listed in major US dictionaries.

The term &quot;people skills&quot; is used to include both psychological skills and social skills but is less inclusive than life skills.

==Social skills==

Social skills are any skills facilitating interaction and communication with others. Social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning such skills is called socialization.

==Soft skills==

Soft skills are a combination of interpersonal people skills, social skills, communication skills, character traits, attitudes, career attributes and emotional intelligence quotient (EQ) among others.

==Development==

Development of a very high level of skill is often desirable for economic, social, or personal reasons. 

In his 2008 book &quot;Outliers&quot;, Malcolm Gladwell proposed the &quot;10,000 hour rule&quot;, that world-class skill could be developed by practicing for 10,000 hours. This principle was disputed by other commentators, pointing out feedback is necessary for improvement, and that practice is no guarantee of success.

In his 2019 book &quot;&quot;, David Epstein argues that a period of sampling different activities (whether musical instruments, sports, or professions) can be helpful before choosing a specialization. Epstein argues that many tasks require a variety of skills which tend to be possessed by more well-rounded people, and finding a task which is a better fit to one&#x27;s personality and interests can overcome the advantage otherwise provided by having more practice earlier in life and attempting peak performance as a younger person. Someone who has demonstrated a high level of knowledge or skill in multiple disciplines is known as a polymath, or in musical performance, a multi-instrumentalist.

A long-standing question is to what extent skills can be learned versus the degree that innate talent is required for high-caliber performance. Epstein finds evidence for both sides with respect to high-performance sport in his 2013 book &quot;The Sports Gene&quot;. For thinking tasks, the heritability of IQ has been extensively studied to try to answer this question, though does not necessarily map directly onto skill level for any given thinking task.

<doc id="355345" wikidata="Q729659" url="?curid=355345" title="William Tell (opera)">
<text>William Tell (; ) is a French-language opera in four acts by Italian composer Gioachino Rossini to a libretto by Victor-Joseph Étienne de Jouy and L. F. Bis, based on Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s play &quot;Wilhelm Tell,&quot; which, in turn, drew on the William Tell legend. The opera was Rossini&#x27;s last, although he lived for nearly 40 more years. Fabio Luisi said that Rossini planned for &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; to be his last opera even as he composed it. The often-performed overture in four sections features a depiction of a storm and a vivacious finale, the &quot;March of the Swiss Soldiers&quot;.

Paris Opéra archivist Charles Malherbe discovered the original orchestral score of the opera at a secondhand book seller&#x27;s shop, resulting in its being acquired by the Paris Conservatoire in 1900.

==Performance history==
&quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; was first performed by the Paris Opéra at the Salle Le Peletier on 3 August 1829, but within three performances cuts were being made and after a year only three acts were performed. The opera&#x27;s length, roughly four hours of music, and casting requirements, such as the high range required for the tenor part, have contributed to the difficulty of producing the work. When performed, the opera is often cut. Performances have been given in both French and Italian. Political concerns have also contributed to the varying fortunes of the work.

In Italy, because the work glorified a revolutionary figure against authority, the opera encountered difficulties with the Italian censors, and the number of productions in Italy was limited. The Teatro San Carlo produced the opera in 1833, but then did not give another production for around 50 years. The first Venice production, at the Teatro La Fenice, was not until 1856. By contrast, in Vienna, in spite of censorship problems there, the Vienna Court Opera gave 422 performances over the years 1830 to 1907. As &quot;Hofer, or the Tell of the Tyrol&quot;, the opera was first performed at Drury Lane in London on 1 May 1830 (in English), with a production in Italian following in 1839 at Her Majesty&#x27;s, and in French at Covent Garden in 1845. In New York, &quot;William Tell&quot; was first presented on 19 September 1831. It was revived at the Metropolitan Opera in 1923 with Rosa Ponselle and Giovanni Martinelli, and there were revivals during the 1930s in Milan, Rome, Paris, Berlin and Florence. When the opera was performed at Gran Teatre del Liceu (Barcelona) in 1893, an anarchist threw two Orsini bombs in the theatre.

In the later 20th century there were major productions in Florence (1972), Geneva (1979, 1991), La Scala (1988), Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1989), Covent Garden (1990), and then Opéra Bastille (2003) as well as at the Sportspalace in Pesaro (lasting over 5 hours, 1995).
In 2010 there was an important revival of the opera, when it opened the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia&#x27;s season, under Antonio Pappano. This performance was of the French version, with some cuts to particularly the fourth act (which Pappano noted had been approved by Rossini himself). A live recording of this concert performance was released in 2011, and the production was transferred to The Proms in July of that year, with Michele Pertusi taking on the title role, Patricia Bardon as Hedwige, Nicolas Courjal as Gessler, and Mark Stone as Leuthold. The performance was very well reviewed, and marked the first full performance of the work in the history of the Proms.

A co-production by the Dutch National Opera and the Metropolitan Opera New York of the opera in the original French opened at the Met in October 2016 with Gerald Finley in the title role.

According to an anecdote, when an admirer told the composer that he had heard his opera the previous night, Rossini replied &quot;What? The whole of it?&quot;. Another version of the story refers only to act 2. In 1864 Offenbach quoted the patriotic trio from act 2, &quot;Lorsque la Grèce est un champ de carnage&quot; in &quot;La belle Hélène&quot;.

==Overture==
The famous overture to the opera is often heard independently of the complete work. Its high-energy finale, &quot;March of the Swiss Soldiers&quot;, is particularly familiar through its use in the American radio and television shows of &quot;The Lone Ranger.&quot; Several portions of the overture were used prominently in the films &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and &quot;The Eagle Shooting Heroes;&quot; in addition, Dmitri Shostakovich quotes the main theme of the finale in the first movement of his 15th symphony. The overture has four parts, each linked to the next:

*&quot;The Prelude (Dawn)&quot; is written only for the cello section (including parts for five soloists), the double basses, and the timpani, in a slow tempo and in E major.
*&quot;The Storm&quot; is a dynamic section played by the full orchestra, with backup from the trombones, in E minor.
*The &quot;Ranz des Vaches&quot;, or &quot;call to the dairy cows&quot;, features the cor anglais (English horn) and the flute. It is in G major.
*The finale (&quot;March of the Swiss Soldiers&quot;) is an ultra-dynamic &quot;cavalry charge&quot; galop heralded by horns and trumpets, and is played by the full orchestra in E major.

==Roles==
==Instrumentation==
The instrumentation is:
*Woodwinds: a piccolo, a flute, 2 oboes (1st doubles cor anglais), 2 clarinets in A and 2 bassoons
*Brass: 4 horns (2 in G and 2 in E), 4 trumpets in E and 3 trombones
*Percussion: 2 timpani, triangle, bass drum, cymbals, bell and tam-tam
*Strings: first violins, second violins, viola, violoncelli, double basses, 2 harps
*On stage: 4 horns

==Synopsis==
:Place: Austrian-occupied Switzerland
:Time: 13th century

===Act 1===
&quot;By the shore of Lake Lucerne, at Bürglen in the canton of Uri&quot;

It is the day of the Shepherd Festival, in May, near Lake Lucerne. The action opens on an idyllic scene, with the local peasants busily preparing chalets for three newly wedded couples, singing as they work (&quot;Quel jour serein le ciel présage&quot; – &quot;What a serene day the sky foretells&quot;). The fisherman, Ruodi, sings a gentle love song from his boat (to orchestral accompaniment from the harps and flutes). Tell stands apart from the general merriment, however: he is consumed with &quot;ennui&quot; at Switzerland&#x27;s continued oppression (&quot;Il chante, et l&#x27;Helvétie pleure sa liberté&quot; – &quot;He sings, and Helvetia mourns her liberty&quot;). His wife and son add their own interpretation of Ruodi&#x27;s song, presaging the coming nautical dramas.

The activities are interrupted by the &quot;ranz des vaches&quot; resounding from the hills (often performed by off-stage horns, and echoing in its theme the &quot;ranz de vaches&quot; in the opera&#x27;s overture). The horns also signal the arrival of Melchthal, a respected elder of the canton. He is persuaded by Hedwige to bless the couples at the celebration. However, his son Arnold, though of marriageable age, is not participating and is evidently uncomfortable. The entire on-stage cast sings in celebration (&quot;Célebrons tous en ce beau jour, le travail, l&#x27;hymen et l&#x27;amour&quot; – &quot;Let all celebrate, on this glorious day, work, marriage and love&quot;). Tell invites Melchthal into his chalet; before they move off, Melchthal chides his son for his failure to marry.

His father&#x27;s rebuke provokes an outpouring of despair from Arnold: in his recitative we learn of his previous service in the forces of the Austrian rulers, his rescue of Mathilde from an avalanche, and the conflict between his love for her and his shame at serving the &quot;perfidious power&quot;. Horn fanfares herald the approach of Gesler, the Austrian governor, whom the Swiss detest, and his entourage. Arnold moves off to greet their arrival, as Mathilde will accompany them, but is stopped by Tell. Inquiring as to where Arnold is going, Tell persuades him to consider joining the planned rebellion against the governor. The expressive duet in which this takes place again shows the tension Arnold feels between his love for Mathilde and the &quot;fatherland&quot; (&quot;Ah! Mathilde, idole de mon âme!...Ô ma patrie, mon cœur te sacrifie...&quot; – &quot;Ah, Mathilde, idol of my soul...O my fatherland, my heart sacrifices to you...&quot;). By the end of the exchange, Arnold is prepared to confront Gesler the moment he arrives; Tell persuades him to at least let the festival pass in peace, but knows he has gained a convert to the cause of freedom.

The villagers then reassemble, and Melchthal blesses the couples. The blessing is followed by singing, dancing and an archery contest that Tell&#x27;s young son Jemmy wins with his first shot – a result of his &quot;paternal heritage&quot;. It is Jemmy who notices the hurried approach of the pale, trembling and wounded shepherd, Leuthold, who killed one of Gesler&#x27;s soldiers to defend his daughter and is fleeing the governor&#x27;s forces. He seeks to escape to the opposite shore, but the cowardly Ruodi refuses to take him in his boat, fearing that the current and the rocks make approaching the opposite bank impossible. Tell returns from searching for the departed Arnold just in time: even as the soldiers approach, calling for Leuthold&#x27;s blood, Tell takes Leuthold into the boat and out onto the water. Gesler&#x27;s guards arrive, led by Rodolphe, who is further incensed by the villagers&#x27; prayers and their evident joy at the escape. Melchthal urges the villagers not to tell Rodolphe who it was who aided Leuthold, and is taken prisoner by the guards. As Rodolphe and the soldiers promise retribution (&quot;Que du ravage, que du pillage sur ce rivage pèse l&#x27;horreur!&quot;), Tell&#x27;s family and friends take comfort in Tell&#x27;s skills as an archer, which will surely save them.

===Act 2===
&quot;On the heights of Rütli, overlooking the Lake and the Cantons&quot;

A hunting party of ladies and gentlemen, accompanied by soldiers, hears the sound of the shepherds returning from the hills as night approaches. Hearing the Governor&#x27;s horns, they too take their leave. Mathilde, however, lingers, believing she has glimpsed Arnold in the vicinity. She is, like Arnold, anguished by the love she feels for her rescuer, and contemplates it as she sings (&quot;Sombre forêt, désert triste et sauvage&quot; – &quot;Somber forest, sad and savage wilderness&quot;). Arnold appears, and each confesses to the other their desire for this meeting. In their duet (&quot;Oui, vous l&#x27;arrachez à mon âme&quot; – &quot;Yes, you wring from my soul&quot;), they recognise their mutual passion, but also the obstacles they face. Urging him to &quot;return to the fields of glory&quot;, Mathilde assures him of the eventual acceptability of his suit, and leaves at the approach of Tell and Walter. They question Arnold as to why he loves Mathilde, a member of the oppressing Austrians. Arnold, offended by their spying, declares his intention to continue fighting for the Austrians, and thus gain glory, rather than liberty. However, when Walter tells him that Gesler has executed his father Melchthal, Arnold vows revenge (&quot;Qu&#x27;entends-je? ô crime!&quot; – &quot;What do I hear? O crime!&quot;).

As the three men affirm their dedication – &quot;to independence or death&quot; – they hear the sound of someone else approaching. It is the men of the canton of Unterwalden coming to join the fight, and describing their journey in a rather gentle refrain (&quot;Nous avons su braver&quot;). In quick succession, they are joined by the men of Schwyz (&quot;En ces temps de malheurs&quot;) and Uri (&quot;Guillaume, tu le vois&quot;). The gathering is complete, and the tone and tempo of the finale rises as the men of the three cantons affirm their willingness to fight or die for the freedom of Switzerland (&quot;Jurons, jurons par nos dangers&quot; – &quot;Let us swear, let us swear by our dangers&quot;). Plans are made to arm the cantons and to rise up when &quot;the beacons of vengeance burn&quot;.

===Act 3===

&quot;Scene 1: A ruined/deserted chapel in the Altdorf palace grounds&quot;

Arnold has come to tell Mathilde that, instead of leaving for battle, he is staying to avenge his father, and thereby renouncing both glory and Mathilde. When he tells her that it was Gesler who had his father executed, she denounces his crime, and recognises the impossibility of their love (&quot;Pour notre amour, plus d&#x27;espérance&quot; – &quot;All hope for our love has gone&quot;). Hearing preparations for the coming festival in the palace grounds, they bid a fond farewell to each other (&quot;Sur la rive étrangère&quot; – &quot;Though upon a foreign shore&quot;).

&quot;Scene 2: The main square at Altdorf&quot;

The day is the hundredth anniversary of Austrian rule in Switzerland. Soldiers sing of the glories of Gesler and the Emperor. In commemoration, Gesler has had his hat placed on top of a pole and the Swiss are ordered and then forced to pay homage to the hat. Gesler commands that there should be dancing and singing to mark the century during which the empire has &quot;deigned to sustain [Swiss] weakness&quot;, and a variety of dances and choruses follow. Soldiers have noticed Tell and his son in the crowd, refusing to pay homage to the hat, and drag him forward. Rodolphe recognises him as the man who assisted in Leuthold&#x27;s escape, and Gesler orders his arrest. In a complex choir and quartet, the soldiers express their hesitation at arresting this famed archer (&quot;C&#x27;est là cet archer redoutable&quot; – &quot;It&#x27;s that redoubtable archer&quot;), Gesler forces them to act, and Tell urges Jemmy to flee, but he prefers to stay with his father.

Gesler notices the affection Tell has for his son, and has Jemmy seized. Inspired, he devises his test: Tell must shoot an arrow through an apple balanced on Jemmy&#x27;s head – should he refuse, both of them will die. The assembled Swiss are horrified at this cruelty, but Jemmy urges his father to courage, and refuses to be tied up for the challenge. Resigned, Tell retrieves his bow from the soldiers, but takes two arrows from his quiver and hides one of them. He sings an anguished aria to Jemmy, instructing him (&quot;Sois immobile&quot; – &quot;Stay completely still&quot;), and the two separate. Finally, Tell draws his bow, shoots, and drives the arrow through the apple and into the stake. The people acclaim his victory, and Gesler is enraged. Noticing the second arrow, he demands to know what Tell intended for it. Tell confesses his desire to kill Gesler with the second arrow, and both he and Jemmy are seized for execution.

Mathilde enters and claims Jemmy in the name of the emperor, refusing to let a child die (&quot;Vous ne l&#x27;obtiendrez pas&quot; – &quot;You will not have him&quot;). Gesler announces his intention to take Tell across Lake Lucerne to the fort at Kusnac/Küssnacht, and there to throw him to the reptiles in the lake. Rodolphe expresses concern at attempting a journey on the lake in the storm, but Gesler intends to force Tell, an expert boatman, to pilot the vessel. They leave, amid conflicting cries of &quot;Anathema on Gesler&quot; from the people, and &quot;Long live Gesler&quot; from the soldiers.

===Act 4===
&quot;Scene 1: Old Melchthal&#x27;s house&quot;
Arnold, aware of Tell&#x27;s arrest, is dispirited, but, set on revenge, draws strength from being in his father&#x27;s former home and sings a moving lament (&quot;Ne m&#x27;abandonne point, espoir de la vengeance... Asile héréditaire...&quot; – &quot;Do not abandon me, hope of vengeance... Home of my forefathers&quot;). Would-be &quot;confederates&quot; arrive, sharing and reinforcing his hope of vengeance. Revived, Arnold points them to the weapons cache that his father and Tell had prepared. Seeing the men armed, Arnold launches into a hugely demanding aria (&quot;Amis, amis, secondez ma vengeance&quot; – &quot;Friends, friends, assist my vengeance&quot;), replete with multiple and sustained top Cs. Resolved, they leave to storm Altdorf and free Tell.

&quot;Scene 2: The rocky shore of Lake Lucerne&quot;

Hedwige is wandering by the lake, distraught. She tells the other women she intends to beg Gesler for Tell&#x27;s life. In the distance, she hears Jemmy calling. Her son enters, along with Mathilde, whom Hedwige entreats for assistance. In some versions, Mathilde, Jemmy and Hedwige sing a moving trio (&quot;Je rends a votre amour un fils digne de vous&quot; – &quot;I return to your love a son worthy of you&quot;). Jemmy tells his mother that Tell is no longer in Altdorf, but on the lake, at which point Hedwige begins precipitously to mourn (&quot;Sauve Guillaume! Il meurt victime de son amour pour son pays&quot; – &quot;Save William! He dies a victim of his love for his country&quot;). Leuthold arrives, telling the assembled villagers that the boat carrying Tell, Gesler and the soldiers is being driven towards the rocks by a storm that has broken over the lake – Leuthold believes that the chains have been removed from Tell&#x27;s hands, so that he might pilot the boat to safety.

The boat pulls into view, and Tell jumps ashore before pushing the boat back. He is amazed to see his house burning in the distance. Jemmy tells him that, for want of a beacon, he set fire to their home but, before doing so, he retrieved his father&#x27;s bow and arrows. Gesler and the soldiers come into view, intent on recapturing Tell, who kills Gesler with a single shot and the cry, &quot;Let Switzerland breathe!&quot; Walter and a group of confederates arrive, having seen the burning house. Tell informs them of Gesler&#x27;s death, but cautions that Altdorf still stands. Arnold and his band enter, and break the happy news: they have taken Altdorf. Arnold sees Mathilde, who declares herself &quot;disabused of false grandeur&quot; and ready to join the fight for liberty at his side.

The clouds break, and the sun shines on a pastoral scene of wild beauty. The gathered Swiss fighters and women sing a paean to the magnificence of nature and the return of freedom in a lyrical C major aria (&quot;Tout change et grandit en ces lieux... Liberté, redescends des cieux&quot; – &quot;Everything is changing and growing grander in this place... Liberty, descend again from heaven&quot;) as the &quot;ranz des vaches&quot; motif returns once again and finally.

During the Crimean War John MacLeod transcribed &quot;La tua danza sì leggiera&quot;, a chorus part in the third act, to create the tune &quot;The Green Hills of Tyrol&quot;, a well-known retreat march in the Scottish bagpipe tradition. The musician Andy Stewart added lyrics and the song in 1961 became a hit under the name &quot;A Scottish Soldier&quot;.

==Recordings==
== In popular culture ==
Characters and scenes from the opera &quot;William Tell&quot; are recognisable on the court cards and aces of William Tell cards, playing cards that were designed in Hungary around 1835. These cards spread across the Austro-Hungarian Empire and are still the most common German-suited playing cards in that part of the world today. Characters portrayed on the Obers and Unters include: Hermann Gessler, Walter Fürst, Rudolf Harras and William Tell.

<doc id="355349" wikidata="Q3408368" url="?curid=355349" title="Forms of address in the United Kingdom">
<text>Forms of address used in the United Kingdom are given below.

==Terminology==

===Abbreviations===

Several terms have been abbreviated in the tables below. The forms used in the table are given first, followed by alternative acceptable abbreviations in parentheses. The punctuation of each abbreviation depends on the source. For example, the punctuation of &quot;The Rt Hon&quot; is not consistent throughout sources. &quot;The Gazette&quot; favours &quot;The Rt. Hon.&quot;, while the government usually prefers &quot;The Rt Hon&quot; or &quot;The Rt Hon.&quot;

*His/Her Majesty: HM ( TM)
*His/Her Royal Highness: HRH ( TRH)
*His/Her Grace: HG ( TG)
*The Most Honourable: The Most Hon (The Most Honble)
*The Right Honourable: The Rt Hon (The Rt Honble)
*The Honourable: The Hon (The Honble)
*The Much Honoured: The Much Hon (The Much Hon&#x27;d)
*The Most Reverend: The Most Rev (The Most Revd or The Most Rev&#x27;d)
*The Right Reverend: The Rt Rev (The Rt Revd or The Rt Rev&#x27;d)
*The Very Reverend: The Very Rev (The Very Revd or The Very Rev&#x27;d)
*The Reverend: The Rev (The Revd or The Rev&#x27;d)
*The Venerable: The Ven (The Venble)

&quot;The Most Noble&quot;, which is an abbreviation of &quot;The Most High, Potent, and Noble&quot;, is rarely used by Dukes and Duchesses; when used, the forenames of the peer or peeress can be used after &quot;His Grace&quot; but before &quot;The Duke of [...]&quot;. This style is also sometimes used without &quot;His Grace&quot;.

===Names and territorial designations===

*&quot;London&quot; represents the territorial designation of any peerage.
**&quot;Edinburgh&quot; represents any territorial designation in Scotland.
**&quot;Birmingham&quot; represents any manor in England or Wales.
*&quot;John&quot; and &quot;William&quot; represent any male name
*&quot;Jane&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot; represent any female name.
*&quot;Smith&quot; and &quot;Brown&quot; represent any surname, regardless of gender.

In regards to the nobility, Mary Brown represents a woman who married John Brown, while Jane Smith represents an unmarried woman.

==Royalty==
==Nobility==

The preposition &quot;of&quot; may be omitted in the form of Marquessates and Earldoms and included in the form of Scottish Viscountcies. It is not often present in peerage Baronies and Lordships of Parliament, though always present in Dukedoms and Scottish feudal Baronies.

The definite article &quot;the&quot; in the middle of two or more titles is sometimes capitalized, as in these tables. However this is controversial: traditional British guides use the lower-case &quot;the&quot;. As a single example, Debrett&#x27;s gives &quot;Major-General the Lord ...&quot;, and Pears&#x27; Cyclopaedia in the section on Modes of Address gives several examples where the definite article interior to a list of honours is lower case.

===Peers and peeresses===
===Eldest sons of dukes, marquesses and earls===

Eldest sons of dukes, marquesses and earls use their father&#x27;s most senior subsidiary title as courtesy titles, without &quot;The&quot; before the title. If applicable, eldest sons of courtesy marquesses or courtesy earls also use a subsidiary title from their (great) grandfather, which is lower ranking than the one used by their father. Eldest daughters do not have courtesy titles; all courtesy peeresses are wives of courtesy peers.
===Heirs of Scottish peers===

Heirs-apparent and heirs-presumptive of Scottish peers use the titles &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Mistress&quot;; these are substantive, not courtesy titles. If, however, the individual is the eldest son of a Duke, Marquess or Earl, then he uses the appropriate courtesy title, as noted above.

===Male descendants of peers===
===Female descendants of peers===

If a daughter of a peer or courtesy peer marries another peer or courtesy peer, she takes her husband&#x27;s rank. If she marries anyone else, she keeps her rank and title, using her husband&#x27;s surname instead of her maiden name.

==Gentry and minor nobility==
Knights and Baronets are distinguished by the use of &quot;Bt&quot; (or, archaically, &quot;Bart&quot;) after the latter&#x27;s names (and by the use of the appropriate post-nominal letters if the former are members of an Order of Chivalry). Esquires are distinguished by the use of &quot;Esq&quot; except in the case of a Scottish laird, whose territorial designation implies the rank of esquire.

===Baronets===

===Scottish barons===
Barons in Scotland are non-peerage nobles in the Baronage of Scotland. The Scottish equivalent to an English baron is Lord of Parliament.

=== Knights and dames ===
===Seigneurs of Fiefs (Channel Islands only)===
===Chiefs, chieftains and lairds===
===Lords of the Manor (England and Wales)===
==Clergy==

===Church of England===

Similar styles are also applied to clergy of equivalent status in other religious organisations. The words &quot;clergy&quot; and &quot;cleric/clerk&quot; are derived from the proper term for bishops, priests and deacons still used in legal documents: (e.g. . Clergy in the Church of England are never addressed as &quot;Revd (Surname)&quot;.

===Church of Scotland===
The Church of Scotland, as a Presbyterian church, recognizes state-awarded titles only as courtesy. In court (assembly, presbytery and session) a person may only be addressed as Mr, Mrs, Miss, Dr, Prof, etc. depending on academic achievement. Thus ministers are correctly addressed as, for example, Mr Smith or Mrs Smith unless they have a higher degree or academic appointment e.g. Dr Smith or Prof. Smith. It is &#x27;infra dig&#x27; to use the style &#x27;Rev&#x27; and even the use of &#x27;the Rev Mr&#x27; requires sensitivity to official style.
==Judiciary==

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====

A judge&#x27;s first name only forms part of their judicial style if, at the time of their appointment, there is a senior judge with the same or a similar surname. Thus, if there is a &quot;Mr Justice Smith&quot;, subsequent judges will be &quot;Mr Justice John Smith&quot;, &quot;Mrs Justice Mary Smith&quot;, etc. High Court Judges and above who are King&#x27;s Counsel do not use the post-nominal letters following appointment or after retirement.

A member of the Bar (but not a solicitor) addresses a circuit judge or higher, out of court, as &quot;Judge&quot;.

====Scotland====

==Academics==

The forms of address used for academics can, in most cases, be either formal or social.

<text>Stornoway Airport () is an airfield located east of the town of Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, in Scotland. 

==History==
The airfield was opened in 1937, and was then used mainly for military purposes. The Royal Air Force had an air base (RAF Stornoway) there during the Second World War and also from 1972 until 1998, when it was a NATO forward operating base. During the Cold War, from 1960 to 1983, the airfield was the home of 112 Signals Unit Stornoway (RAF). NATO aircraft used the airport for missions over the North Atlantic and for stopovers en route to Greenland and the United States. 

Nowadays the airfield is mainly used for domestic passenger services. The Royal Mail have a daily mail flight. Bristow Helicopters operate helicopters equipped for search and rescue, on behalf of His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard. There are privately owned light aircraft based at the airport. The airport also has been used for cross-wind training of large jets, including the Airbus A350.

Stornoway Airport is owned by HIAL, a company controlled by the Scottish Government.

<doc id="355359" wikidata="Q4400655" url="?curid=355359" title="Russian proverbs">
<text>Russian proverbs originated in oral history and written texts dating as far back as the 12th century. The Russian language is replete with many hundreds of proverbs (пословица ) and sayings (поговорка ). 
The proverbs express a universal concept, have a moral lesson and provide an insight into many aspects of history, culture, and national character of the people who created them. By the 17th century, the proverbs were collected and documented. They were studied in the 19th and 20th centuries. Vladimir Dal was a famous lexicographer of the Russian Empire whose collection was published in Russian language in the late 19th century as &quot;The Sayings and Bywords of the Russian People,&quot; featuring more than 30,000 entries. They continue to endure in modern literature and folklore. Evidence of this is seen in the collection of Russian anti-proverbs collected by Reznikov.

<text>The Proclamation of the Republic (), also known as the 1916 Proclamation or the Easter Proclamation, was a document issued by the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army during the Easter Rising in Ireland, which began on 24 April 1916. In it, the Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, writing in English as the &quot;Provisional Government of the Irish Republic,&quot; proclaimed Ireland&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom. The reading of the proclamation by Patrick Pearse outside the General Post Office (GPO) on Sackville Street (now called O&#x27;Connell Street), Dublin&#x27;s main thoroughfare, marked the beginning of the Rising. The proclamation was modelled on a similar independence proclamation issued during the 1803 rebellion by Robert Emmet.

== Principles of the proclamation ==
Although the Rising failed in military terms, the principles of the Proclamation to varying degrees influenced the thinking of later generations of Irish politicians. The document consisted of a number of assertions:

* the Rising&#x27;s leaders spoke for Ireland (a claim historically made by Irish insurrectionary movements);
* the Rising marked another wave of attempts to achieve independence through force of arms;
* the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Irish Volunteers, and the Irish Citizen Army were central to the Rising;
* &quot;the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland&quot;
* the form of government was to be a republic;
* a guarantee of &quot;religious and civil liberty, equal rights, and equal opportunities to all its citizens&quot;, the first mention of gender equality... Irish women under British law were not allowed to vote;
* a commitment to universal suffrage without distinction of sex, a phenomenon limited at the time to only a handful of countries and which did not yet exist in the UK;
* a promise of &quot;cherishing all the children of the nation equally&quot;. Although these words are quoted since the 1990s by children&#x27;s rights advocates, &quot;children of the nation&quot; refers to all Irish people;
* disputes between nationalists and unionists are attributed to &quot;differences carefully fostered by an alien government&quot;, a rejection of what was later dubbed two-nations theory.

== The printing and distribution of the text ==
The proclamation was printed prior to the Rising on a Summit Wharfedale Stop Cylinder Press in Liberty Hall, Eden Quay (HQ of the Irish Citizen Army). The document had problems with the layout and design because of a shortage of type. It was printed in two-halves, printing first the top, then the bottom on one sheet of paper. The paper was sourced from the Swift Brook Paper Mills in Saggart. The typesetters were Willie O&#x27;Brien, Michael Molloy, and Christopher Brady. They lacked a sufficient supply of type in typeface of the same size, and as a result, some parts of the document use an &quot;e&quot; from a different typeface, which are smaller and do not match.

The language suggested the original copy of the proclamation was signed by the Rising&#x27;s leaders. However, no evidence is found nor do any contemporary records mention, the existence of an &quot;actually signed&quot; copy, although if such a copy existed, it could easily be destroyed in the aftermath of the Rising by someone with no appreciation of its historic importance. Molloy says he set the document from a handwritten copy, with signatures on a separate piece of paper which he destroyed by chewing while in prison, but this was disputed by other participants. Molloy also recalled Connolly asked for the document to resemble an auctioneer&#x27;s notice in general design.

About thirty originals remain, one of which can be viewed in the National Print Museum. Later reproductions are sometimes mis-attributed as originals. After British soldiers recaptured Liberty Hall, they found the press with the type of the bottom of the proclamation, and reportedly ran off some copies as souvenirs, leading to a proliferation of these &#x27;half-copies&#x27;. James Mosley notes complete originals rapidly became rare in the chaos, and, over a month later, the Dublin police force failed to find any for their files.

== The signatories ==

The signatories (as their names appeared on the Proclamation):
* Thomas J. Clarke
* Seán Mac Diarmada
* Thomas MacDonagh
* P. H. Pearse
* Éamonn Ceannt
* James Connolly
* Joseph Plunkett

The first name among the signatories is not Pearse but Tom Clarke, a veteran republican. If the arrangement of names were alphabetical, Éamonn Ceannt would appear on top. Clarke&#x27;s widow maintained it was because the plan was for Clarke, a famed veteran, to become the &quot;President of the Provisional Republic&quot;. This explanation explains his top position. However, others associated with the Rising dismissed these claims made in her memoirs. Later documents issued by the rebels gave Pearse pride of place, although as &#x27;Commanding in Chief the Forces of the Irish Republic, and President of the Provisional Government, not &#x27;President of the Republic&#x27;. Historians continue to speculate whether Clarke was to be a symbolic head of state and Pearse as head of government or Pearse was always to be central but with statements ambiguously describing his title.

All seven signatories of the proclamation were executed by the British military (James Connolly who had been wounded in the fighting was executed sitting down in a chair) in the aftermath of the Rising, being viewed as having committed treason in wartime (i.e. the First World War). British political leaders regarded the executions initially as unwise, later as a catastrophe, with the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and later prime minister David Lloyd George stating that they regretted allowing the British military to treat the matter as a matter of military law in wartime, rather than insisting that the leaders were treated under civilian criminal law. Though initially deeply unsympathetic to the Rising (the leading Irish nationalist newspaper, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; called for their execution), Irish public opinion switched and became more sympathetic due to the manner of their treatment and executions. Eventually Asquith&#x27;s government ordered a halt to the executions and insisted that those not already executed be dealt with through civilian, not military, law. By that stage, all the signatories and a number of others had been executed.

== The document today ==

Full copies of the Easter Proclamation are now treated as a revered Irish national icon, and a copy was sold at auction for €390,000 in December 2004. A copy owned (and later signed as a memento) by Rising participant Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly was presented by him to the Irish parliament buildings, Leinster House, during his tenure as President of Ireland. It is currently on permanent display in the main foyer. Other copies are on display in the GPO (headquarters of the Rising and the place where the Proclamation was first read), the National Museum of Ireland, the Trinity College Library&#x27;s Long Room, the GAA Museum in Croke Park, and other museums worldwide. Facsimile copies are sold as souvenirs in Ireland, and copies of the text are often displayed in Irish schools and in Irish pubs throughout the world. The proclamation is read aloud by an Officer of the Irish Defence Forces outside the GPO during the Easter Rising commemorations on Easter Sunday of each year.

POBLACHT NA hÉIREANN&lt;br&gt;
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
OF THE
IRISH REPUBLIC
TO THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND

IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN:&lt;br&gt; In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.

Having organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary organisation, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military organisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to reveal itself, she now seizes that moment and supported by her exiled children in America and by gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.

We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the past three hundred years they have asserted it in arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades in arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.

The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally, and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien Government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.

Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a permanent National Government, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby constituted, will administer the civil and military affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.

We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most High God, Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, inhumanity, or rapine. In this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline, and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.

:&quot;Signed on behalf of the Provisional Government:&quot;
:::::THOMAS J. CLARKE

<doc id="355371" wikidata="Q1606240" url="?curid=355371" title="Starman (DC Comics)">
<text>Starman is a name used by several different DC Comics superheroes, most prominently Ted Knight and his sons David and Jack.

The original Starman, Ted Knight, was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Jack Burnley. He first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #61 (April 1941). Knight is an astronomer who invented a &quot;gravity rod&quot;, later reinvented as a &quot;cosmic rod&quot;, that allows him to fly and manipulate energy. He donned a red and green costume with a distinctive finned helmet.

Like most Golden Age heroes, Starman fell into obscurity in the 1950s. In the ensuing years, several characters, with varying degrees of relation to the original, briefly took the mantle of Starman.

In &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time&quot; #1 (September 1994), writer James Robinson and artist Tony Harris introduced Jack Knight, the son of the first Starman. A reluctant non-costumed hero, he inherited his father&#x27;s name and mission and used his technology to create a cosmic staff. He starred in a critically acclaimed series, written by Robinson, from 1994 until 2001.

The current successor of Starman is Stargirl, formerly the second Star-Spangled Kid.

Starman, announcing that he comes &quot;from the past&quot;, appears in &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 4) #7 (November 2018) and subsequent issues.

Below, in chronological order of activity (not of appearance), are the characters to have used the name &quot;Starman&quot;.

==Theodore Knight==

Theodore Henry Knight is a 1940s DC Comics superhero who wore a red costume with a finned helmet and a green cape, and wielded a &quot;gravity rod&quot; (later &quot;cosmic rod&quot;) which enabled him to fly and fire energy bolts. He is a member of the Justice Society of America.

==Starman of 1951==
The Starman of 1951 is a superhero who operated in the DC Universe in 1951. In pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, the Starman of the 1950s was actually Batman, who briefly took up that mantle in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #247 (September 1957), using variants of his usual equipment, but with a star motif instead of a bat, due to him having been hypnotized to be given a fear of bats in the belief that this would render him incapable of being a hero.

Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, the character was retconned in &quot;Starman Secret Files and Origins&quot;. The name was first used by the original Dr. Mid-Nite, Charles McNider. When David Knight, son of the original Starman, is drawn back in time, he takes over the identity from McNider for a brief period.

==Star-Man==
In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #286, a villainous Star-Man appeared to menace Batman and Robin whose super-strength waned in the presence of a Tibetan belt worn by Batwoman.

==Mikaal Tomas==

Mikaal Tomas is an alien who traveled to Earth to help conquer it, but instead turned against his war-like people in defense of the human race. He first appeared in &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #12 (March 1976), and is notable as one of DC Comics&#x27; earliest openly gay superheroes.

==Prince Gavyn==

Prince Gavyn is a DC Comics superhero created by Paul Levitz and Steve Ditko in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #467 (January 1980). He is a spoiled, blond, playboy prince of an alien empire who discovered he was a mutant who could survive unaided in space.

==Will Payton==

Will Payton, a 1980s DC Comics superhero, was created by Roger Stern and Tom Lyle. Payton gained his powers of flight, super strength, the ability to alter his appearance and fire bolts of energy from his hands after being struck by a bolt of energy from a satellite in space. He was in his early twenties and worked as a magazine copy editor. He first appeared in &quot;Starman&quot; #1 (October 1988).

==David Knight==
David Knight, a 1990s DC Comics superhero, was the son of the original Starman and elder brother of the 1990s Starman, Jack. He first appeared in &quot;Starman&quot; #26 (September 1990), having taken up his father&#x27;s mantle, and was killed by an assassin in &quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 2) #0 (October 1994). However, his spirit returns to advise Jack.

In &quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 2) #81 (a one-issue revival and tie-in to &quot;Blackest Night&quot;), David temporarily returns as a Black Lantern.

==Jack Knight==

Jack Knight, a 1990s DC Comics superhero, is the son of the original Starman, Ted Knight. He wields a cosmically powered staff, but refuses to wear a costume, instead preferring a T-shirt, leather jacket (with star emblem on the back), a Cracker Jack prize sheriff&#x27;s star, and goggles. A reluctant hero who assumes the mantle after David&#x27;s death, he is the protagonist of the comic book series written by James Robinson. Jack briefly joins the JSA, but retires at the end of the &quot;Starman&quot; series and gives his cosmic rod to Stargirl.

==Thom Kallor==
Thom Kallor is a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st century who can manipulate mass and density. Normally known as Star Boy, he becomes Starman after being transported to the 21st century.

==Farris Knight==
The Starman of the 853rd century is Farris Knight, who is also a member of Justice Legion Alpha and was a major character in the series &quot;DC One Million&quot;. He is a distant descendant of Jack Knight and the Mist&#x27;s son. Farris commands an alien artifact called a &quot;quarvat&quot;, similar in function to the &quot;cosmic rod&quot;. He lives on a space station in the orbit of Uranus from which he monitors the artificial sun Solaris. He asserts that being the descendant of the Mist as much as the Knights, he was predisposed to villainy, and Solaris eventually corrupts Farris. The man arranges for the defeat of the two JLAs and travels back in time to kill the originator of his hated responsibility, Ted Knight. Meeting Ted, however, changes his mind and Farris sacrifices himself to save the modern day Earth from Solaris.

==Victor Sono==
Introduced in &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; (vol. 2) #27 (March 2008), the &quot;Star Man&quot; of the Old West originally came to New York City with his father from Italy just after the Civil War ended. His name was Victor Sono. His father tried to get work as a sheriff, but the group of lawmen with whom he interviewed mocked and killed him for being disabled. Young Victor later found his body hanging outside the building and decided to avenge his death. He pickpocketed a pistol and fired on the group. Before he could do much damage, however, the owner of the pistol, Jonah Hex, who was in town collecting a bounty, knocked him out and took his gun back. He nearly left the boy to the &quot;lawmen&quot;, but after recalling his own terrible childhood, came back and rescued Victor, whom he left at an orphanage. Years later, Hex and Victor would cross paths again, Victor now calling himself the Star Man. He had dedicated his life to killing unjust lawmen and adding their sheriff&#x27;s stars to his coat. The Star Man has a habit of manipulating Hex for his own ends, although he does know that he owes Hex his life.

==Titles==
===&quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 1)===

&quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 1) was a DC Comics ongoing series starring Starman (Will Payton). The series was published from October 1988 to April 1992. This Starman also appeared in a short story in &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; #622 released October 18, 1988.

===&quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 2)===

&quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 2) was an ongoing series published by DC Comics from October 1994 to August 2001, starring the superhero Starman (Jack Knight). The series was written by James Robinson with art primarily by Tony Harris from issues #0–45 and Peter Snejbjerg from issues #50–80.

====Style====

&quot;Starman&quot; included a number of signature thematic and stylistic elements, which helped make it distinctive. One was the importance of collectibles and collecting. James Robinson was an avid collector of a number of different things and transferred this interest to the hero, Jack Knight, who ran a collectibles shop. Many of the guest characters would also discuss their collecting interests. The book also dealt with the past and nostalgia quite frequently. One manner was through the irregular appearance of &quot;Times Past&quot; issues set in a different time period. These usually, but not always, focused on one of the other Starmen or the Shade. Text pieces, dubbed &quot;The Shade&#x27;s Journal&quot; and dealing with that character&#x27;s adventures over his long life, also appeared irregularly instead of a letter column. In addition, most of the characters who appeared in the book had some connection to a legacy from the past. They were either immortal, had inherited a role from a family member, or were the reincarnation of a previous hero. The book also featured a number of discussions and meditations on age. Another stylistic theme in the book was the often impressionistic approach to violence and conflict. The lead up to, and aftereffects of, violence were generally much more important in the &quot;Starman&quot; comic book than the violence itself. A number of confrontations that Jack Knight had with &quot;villains&quot; ended peacefully, such as an early encounter with a bounty hunter who broke into Jack&#x27;s shop looking for an enchanted shirt. After a short scuffle, Jack, seeing no reason not to, agrees to sell the man the shirt. When violence was depicted, it was often much more impressionistic instead of the highly choreographed and detailed violence seen in many superhero comics. Finally, a sense of place informed many Starman stories. James Robinson has stated his appreciation for the fictional cities of the DC Universe. With &quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 2), he attempted to develop the setting of Opal City as a real place with a distinct character. Robinson and artist Tony Harris developed maps of Opal City and came up with a fictional history of it. Characters would often make mention of specific locations in the city and small bits of its history.

====Story arcs====

Commenting on the character and series, comic writer Geoff Johns wrote:

It was also nominated for &quot;Best Continuing Series&quot; in 1997.

<text>A photonic crystal is an optical nanostructure in which the refractive index changes periodically. This affects the propagation of light in the same way that the structure of natural crystals gives rise to X-ray diffraction and that the atomic lattices (crystal structure) of semiconductors affect their conductivity of electrons. Photonic crystals occur in nature in the form of structural coloration and animal reflectors, and, as artificially produced, promise to be useful in a range of applications.

Photonic crystals can be fabricated for one, two, or three dimensions. One-dimensional photonic crystals can be made of thin film layers deposited on each other. Two-dimensional ones can be made by photolithography, or by drilling holes in a suitable substrate. Fabrication methods for three-dimensional ones include drilling under different angles, stacking multiple 2-D layers on top of each other, direct laser writing, or, for example, instigating self-assembly of spheres in a matrix and dissolving the spheres.

Photonic crystals can, in principle, find uses wherever light must be manipulated. For example, dielectric mirrors are one-dimensional photonic crystals which can produce ultra-high reflectivity mirrors at a specified wavelength. Two-dimensional photonic crystals called photonic-crystal fibers are used for fiber-optic communication, among other applications. Three-dimensional crystals may one day be used in optical computers, and could lead to more efficient photovoltaic cells.

Although the energy of light (and all electromagnetic radiation) is quantized in units called photons, the analysis of photonic crystals requires only classical physics. &quot;Photonic&quot; in the name is a reference to photonics, a modern designation for the study of light (optics) and optical engineering. Indeed, the first research into what we now call photonic crystals may have been as early as 1887 when the English physicist Lord Rayleigh experimented with periodic multi-layer dielectric stacks, showing they can effect a photonic band-gap in one dimension. Research interest grew with work in 1987 by Eli Yablonovitch and Sajeev John on periodic optical structures with more than one dimension—now called photonic crystals.

==Introduction==

Photonic crystals are composed of periodic dielectric, metallo-dielectric—or even superconductor microstructures or nanostructures that affect electromagnetic wave propagation in the same way that the periodic potential in a semiconductor crystal affects the propagation of electrons, determining allowed and forbidden electronic energy bands. Photonic crystals contain regularly repeating regions of high and low refractive index. Light waves may propagate through this structure or propagation may be disallowed, depending on their wavelength. Wavelengths that may propagate in a given direction are called &quot;modes&quot;, and the ranges of wavelengths which propagate are called &quot;bands&quot;. Disallowed bands of wavelengths are called &quot;photonic band gaps&quot;. This gives rise to distinct optical phenomena, such as inhibition of spontaneous emission, high-reflecting omni-directional mirrors, and low-loss-waveguiding. The bandgap of photonic crystals can be understood as the destructive interference of multiple reflections of light propagating in the crystal at each interface between layers of high- and low- refractive index regions, akin to the bandgaps of electrons in solids.

There are two strategies for opening up the complete photonic band gap. The first one is to increase the refractive index contrast for the band gap in each direction becomes wider and the second one is to make the Brillouin zone more similar to sphere. However, the former is limited by the available technologies and materials and the latter is restricted by the crystallographic restriction theorem. For this reason, the photonic crystals with a complete band gap demonstrated to date have face-centered cubic lattice with the most spherical Brillouin zone and made of high-refractive-index semiconductor materials. Another approach is to exploit quasicrystalline structures with no crystallography limits. A complete photonic bandgap was reported for low-index polymer quasicrystalline samples manufactured by 3D printing.

The periodicity of the photonic crystal structure must be around or greater than half the wavelength (in the medium) of the light waves in order for interference effects to be exhibited. Visible light ranges in wavelength between about 400 nm (violet) to about 700 nm (red) and the resulting wavelength inside a material requires dividing that by the average index of refraction. The repeating regions of high and low dielectric constant must, therefore, be fabricated at this scale. In one dimension, this is routinely accomplished using the techniques of thin-film deposition.

==History==
Photonic crystals have been studied in one form or another since 1887, but no one used the term &quot;photonic crystal&quot; until over 100 years later—after Eli Yablonovitch and Sajeev John published two milestone papers on photonic crystals in 1987. The early history is well-documented in the form of a story when it was identified as one of the landmark developments in physics by the American Physical Society.

Before 1987, one-dimensional photonic crystals in the form of periodic multi-layer dielectric stacks (such as the Bragg mirror) were studied extensively. Lord Rayleigh started their study in 1887, by showing that such systems have a one-dimensional photonic band-gap, a spectral range of large reflectivity, known as a &quot;stop-band&quot;. Today, such structures are used in a diverse range of applications—from reflective coatings to enhancing LED efficiency to highly reflective mirrors in certain laser cavities (see, for example, VCSEL). The pass-bands and stop-bands in photonic crystals were first reduced to practice by Melvin M. Weiner who called those crystals &quot;discrete phase-ordered media.&quot; Weiner achieved those results by extending Darwin&#x27;s dynamical theory for x-ray Bragg diffraction to arbitrary wavelengths, angles of incidence, and cases where the incident wavefront at a lattice plane is scattered appreciably in the forward-scattered direction. A detailed theoretical study of one-dimensional optical structures was performed by Vladimir P. Bykov, who was the first to investigate the effect of a photonic band-gap on the spontaneous emission from atoms and molecules embedded within the photonic structure. Bykov also speculated as to what could happen if two- or three-dimensional periodic optical structures were used. The concept of three-dimensional photonic crystals was then discussed by Ohtaka in 1979, who also developed a formalism for the calculation of the photonic band structure. However, these ideas did not take off until after the publication of two milestone papers in 1987 by Yablonovitch and John. Both these papers concerned high-dimensional periodic optical structures, i.e., photonic crystals. Yablonovitch&#x27;s main goal was to engineer photonic density of states to control the spontaneous emission of materials embedded in the photonic crystal. John&#x27;s idea was to use photonic crystals to affect localisation and control of light.

After 1987, the number of research papers concerning photonic crystals began to grow exponentially. However, due to the difficulty of fabricating these structures at optical scales (see Fabrication challenges), early studies were either theoretical or in the microwave regime, where photonic crystals can be built on the more accessible centimetre scale. (This fact is due to a property of the electromagnetic fields known as scale invariance. In essence, electromagnetic fields, as the solutions to Maxwell&#x27;s equations, have no natural length scale—so solutions for centimetre scale structure at microwave frequencies are the same as for nanometre scale structures at optical frequencies.)

By 1991, Yablonovitch had demonstrated the first three-dimensional photonic band-gap in the microwave regime. The structure that Yablonovitch was able to produce involved drilling an array of holes in a transparent material, where the holes of each layer form an inverse diamond structure – today it is known as Yablonovite.

In 1996, Thomas Krauss demonstrated a two-dimensional photonic crystal at optical wavelengths. This opened the way to fabricate photonic crystals in semiconductor materials by borrowing methods from the semiconductor industry.

Pavel Cheben demonstrated a new type of photonic crystal waveguide – subwavelength grating (SWG) waveguide. The SWG waveguide operates in subwavelength region, away from the bandgap. It allows the waveguide properties to be controlled directly by the nanoscale engineering of the resulting metamaterial while mitigating wave interference effects. This provided “a missing degree of freedom in photonics” and resolved an important limitation in silicon photonics which was its restricted set of available materials insufficient to achieve complex optical on-chip functions.

Today, such techniques use photonic crystal slabs, which are two dimensional photonic crystals &quot;etched&quot; into slabs of semiconductor. Total internal reflection confines light to the slab, and allows photonic crystal effects, such as engineering photonic dispersion in the slab. Researchers around the world are looking for ways to use photonic crystal slabs in integrated computer chips, to improve optical processing of communications—both on-chip and between chips.

Autocloning fabrication technique, proposed for infrared and visible range photonic crystals by Sato et al. in 2002, uses electron-beam lithography and dry etching: lithographically formed layers of periodic grooves are stacked by regulated sputter deposition and etching, resulting in &quot;stationary corrugations&quot; and periodicity. Titanium dioxide/silica and tantalum pentoxide/silica devices were produced, exploiting their dispersion characteristics and suitability to sputter deposition.

Such techniques have yet to mature into commercial applications, but two-dimensional photonic crystals are commercially used in photonic crystal fibres (otherwise known as holey fibres, because of the air holes that run through them). Photonic crystal fibres were first developed by Philip Russell in 1998, and can be designed to possess enhanced properties over (normal) optical fibres.

Study has proceeded more slowly in three-dimensional than in two-dimensional photonic crystals. This is because of more difficult fabrication. Three-dimensional photonic crystal fabrication had no inheritable semiconductor industry techniques to draw on. Attempts have been made, however, to adapt some of the same techniques, and quite advanced examples have been demonstrated, for example in the construction of &quot;woodpile&quot; structures constructed on a planar layer-by-layer basis. Another strand of research has tried to construct three-dimensional photonic structures from self-assembly—essentially letting a mixture of dielectric nano-spheres settle from solution into three-dimensionally periodic structures that have photonic band-gaps. Vasily Astratov&#x27;s group from the Ioffe Institute realized in 1995 that natural and synthetic opals are photonic crystals with an incomplete bandgap. The first demonstration of an &quot;inverse opal&quot; structure with a complete photonic bandgap came in 2000, from researchers at the University of Toronto, and Institute of Materials Science of Madrid (ICMM-CSIC), Spain. The ever-expanding field of natural photonics, bioinspiration and biomimetics—the study of natural structures to better understand and use them in design—is also helping researchers in photonic crystals. For example, in 2006 a naturally occurring photonic crystal was discovered in the scales of a Brazilian beetle. Analogously, in 2012 a diamond crystal structure was found in a weevil and a gyroid-type architecture in a butterfly. More recently, gyroid photonic crystals have been found in the feather barbs of blue-winged leafbirds and are responsible for the bird&#x27;s shimmery blue coloration. Some publications suggest the feasibility of the complete photonic band gap in the visible range in photonic crystals with optically saturated media that can be implemented by using laser light as an external optical pump.

==Construction strategies==
The fabrication method depends on the number of dimensions that the photonic bandgap must exist in.

===One-dimensional photonic crystals===
To produce a one-dimensional photonic crystal, thin film layers of different dielectric constant may be periodically deposited on a surface which leads to a band gap in a particular propagation direction (such as normal to the surface). A Bragg grating is an example of this type of photonic crystal. One-dimensional photonic crystals can include layers of non-linear optical materials in which the non-linear behaviour is accentuated due to field enhancement at wavelengths near a so-called degenerate band edge. This field enhancement (in terms of intensity) can reach formula_1 where &quot;N&quot; is the total number of layers. However, by using layers which include an optically anisotropic material, it has been shown that the field enhancement can reach formula_2, which, in conjunction with non-linear optics, has potential applications such as in the development of an all-optical switch.

A one-dimensional photonic crystal can be implemented using repeated alternating layers of a metamaterial and vacuum. If the metamaterial is such that the relative permittivity and permeability follow the same wavelength dependence, then the photonic crystal behaves identically for TE and TM modes, that is, for both &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; polarizations of light incident at an angle.

Recently, researchers fabricated a graphene-based Bragg grating (one-dimensional photonic crystal) and demonstrated that it supports excitation of surface electromagnetic waves in the periodic structure by using 633 nm He-Ne laser as the light source. Besides, a novel type of one-dimensional graphene-dielectric photonic crystal has also been proposed. This structure can act as a far-IR filter and can support low-loss surface plasmons for waveguide and sensing applications. 1D photonic crystals doped with bio-active metals (i.e. silver) have been also proposed as sensing devices for bacterial contaminants. Similar planar 1D photonic crystals made of polymers have been used to detect volatile organic compounds vapors in atmosphere.
In addition to solid-phase photonic crystals, some liquid crystals with defined ordering can demonstrate photonic color. For example, studies have shown several liquid crystals with short- or long-range one-dimensional positional ordering can form photonic structures.

===Two-dimensional photonic crystals===
In two dimensions, holes may be drilled in a substrate that is transparent to the wavelength of radiation that the bandgap is designed to block. Triangular and square lattices of holes have been successfully employed.

The Holey fiber or photonic crystal fiber can be made by taking cylindrical rods of glass in hexagonal lattice, and then heating and stretching them, the triangle-like airgaps between the glass rods become the holes that confine the modes.

===Three-dimensional photonic crystals===
There are several structure types that have been constructed:

* &quot;Spheres in a diamond lattice&quot;
* Yablonovite
* &quot;The woodpile structure&quot; – &quot;rods&quot; are repeatedly etched with beam lithography, filled in, and covered with a layer of new material. As the process repeats, the channels etched in each layer are perpendicular to the layer below, and parallel to and out of phase with the channels two layers below. The process repeats until the structure is of the desired height. The fill-in material is then dissolved using an agent that dissolves the fill-in material but not the deposition material. It is generally hard to introduce defects into this structure.
* &quot;Inverse opals&quot; or &quot;Inverse Colloidal Crystals&quot;-Spheres (such as polystyrene or silicon dioxide) can be allowed to deposit into a cubic close packed lattice suspended in a solvent. Then a hardener is introduced that makes a transparent solid out of the volume occupied by the solvent. The spheres are then dissolved with an acid such as Hydrochloric acid. The colloids can be either spherical or nonspherical. contains in excess of 750,000 polymer nanorods. Light focused on this beam splitter penetrates or is reflected, depending on polarization.

===Photonic crystal cavities===

Not only band gap, photonic crystals may have another effect if we partially remove the symmetry through the creation a nanosize cavity. This defect allows you to guide or to trap the light with the same function as nanophotonic resonator and it is characterized by the strong dielectric modulation in the photonic crystals. For the waveguide, the propagation of light depends on the in-plane control provided by the photonic band gap and to the long confinement of light induced by dielectric mismatch. For the light trap, the light is strongly confined in the cavity resulting further interactions with the materials. First, if we put a pulse of light inside the cavity, it will be delayed by nano- or picoseconds and this is proportional to the quality factor of the cavity. Finally, if we put an emitter inside the cavity, the emission light also can be enhanced significantly and or even the resonant coupling can go through Rabi oscillation. This is related with cavity quantum electrodynamics and the interactions are defined by the weak and strong coupling of the emitter and the cavity. The first studies for the cavity in one-dimensional photonic slabs are usually in grating or distributed feedback structures. For two-dimensional photonic crystal cavities, they are useful to make efficient photonic devices in telecommunication applications as they can provide very high quality factor up to millions with smaller-than-wavelength mode volume. For three-dimensional photonic crystal cavities, several methods have been developed including lithographic layer-by-layer approach, surface ion beam lithography, and micromanipulation technique. All those mentioned photonic crystal cavities that tightly confine light offer very useful functionality for integrated photonic circuits, but it is challenging to produce them in a manner that allows them to be easily relocated. There is no full control
with the cavity creation, the cavity location, and the emitter position relative to the maximum field of the cavity while the studies to solve those problems are still ongoing. Movable cavity of nanowire in photonic crystals is one of solutions to tailor this light matter interaction.

==Fabrication challenges==

Higher-dimensional photonic crystal fabrication faces two major challenges:
* Making them with enough precision to prevent scattering losses blurring the crystal properties
* Designing processes that can robustly mass-produce the crystals

One promising fabrication method for two-dimensionally periodic photonic crystals is a photonic-crystal fiber, such as a &quot;holey fiber&quot;. Using fiber draw techniques developed for communications fiber it meets these two requirements, and photonic crystal fibres are commercially available. Another promising method for developing two-dimensional photonic crystals is the so-called photonic crystal slab. These structures consist of a slab of material—such as silicon—that can be patterned using techniques from the semiconductor industry. Such chips offer the potential to combine photonic processing with electronic processing on a single chip.

For three dimensional photonic crystals, various techniques have been used—including photolithography and etching techniques similar to those used for integrated circuits. Some of these techniques are already commercially available. To avoid the complex machinery of nanotechnological methods, some alternate approaches involve growing photonic crystals from colloidal crystals as self-assembled structures.

Mass-scale 3D photonic crystal films and fibres can now be produced using a shear-assembly technique that stacks 200–300 nm colloidal polymer spheres into perfect films of fcc lattice. Because the particles have a softer transparent rubber coating, the films can be stretched and molded, tuning the photonic bandgaps and producing striking structural color effects.

==Computing photonic band structure==

The photonic band gap (PBG) is essentially the gap between the air-line and the dielectric-line in the dispersion relation of the PBG system. To design photonic crystal systems, it is essential to engineer the location and size of the bandgap by computational modeling using any of the following methods:

* Plane wave expansion method
* Inverse dispersion method
* Finite element method
* Finite difference time domain method
* Order-n spectral method
* KKR method
* Bloch wave – MoM method

Essentially, these methods solve for the frequencies (normal modes) of the photonic crystal for each value of the propagation direction given by the wave vector, or vice versa. The various lines in the band structure, correspond to the different cases of &quot;n&quot;, the band index. For an introduction to photonic band structure, see K. Sakoda&#x27;s and Joannopoulos books.

The plane wave expansion method can be used to calculate the band structure using an eigen formulation of the Maxwell&#x27;s equations, and thus solving for the eigen frequencies for each of the propagation directions, of the wave vectors. It directly solves for the dispersion diagram. Electric field strength values can also be calculated over the spatial domain of the problem using the eigen vectors of the same problem. For the picture shown to the right, corresponds to the band-structure of a 1D distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) with air-core interleaved with a dielectric material of relative permittivity 12.25, and a lattice period to air-core thickness ratio (d/a) of 0.8, is solved using 101 planewaves over the first irreducible Brillouin zone. The Inverse dispersion method also exploited plane wave expansion but formulates Maxwell&#x27;s equation as an eigenproblem for the wave vector k while the frequency formula_3 is considered as a parameter. Thus, it solves the dispersion relation formula_4 instead of formula_5, which plane wave method does. The inverse dispersion method makes it possible to find complex value of the wave vector e.g. in the bandgap, which allows one to distinguish photonic crystals from metamaterial. Besides, the method is ready for the frequency dispersion of the permittivity to be taken into account.

To speed calculation of the frequency band structure, the Reduced Bloch Mode Expansion (RBME) method can be used. The RBME method applies &quot;on top&quot; of any of the primary expansion methods mentioned above. For large unit cell models, the RBME method can reduce time for computing the band structure by up to two orders of magnitude.

==Applications==

Photonic crystals are attractive optical materials for controlling and manipulating light flow. One dimensional photonic crystals are already in widespread use, in the form of thin-film optics, with applications from low and high reflection coatings on lenses and mirrors to colour changing paints and inks. Higher-dimensional photonic crystals are of great interest for both fundamental and applied research, and the two dimensional ones are beginning to find commercial applications.

The first commercial products involving two-dimensionally periodic photonic crystals are already available in the form of photonic-crystal fibers, which use a microscale structure to confine light with radically different characteristics compared to conventional optical fiber for applications in nonlinear devices and guiding exotic wavelengths. The three-dimensional counterparts are still far from commercialization but may offer additional features such as optical nonlinearity required for the operation of optical transistors used in optical computers, when some technological aspects such as manufacturability and principal difficulties such as disorder are under control.

SWG photonic crystal waveguides have facilitated new integrated photonic devices for controlling transmission of light signals in photonic integrated circuits, including fibre-chip couplers, waveguide crossovers, wavelength and mode multiplexers, ultra-fast optical switches, athermal waveguides, biochemical sensors, polarization management circuits, broadband interference couplers, planar waveguide lenses, anisotropic waveguides, nanoantennas and optical phased arrays. SWG nanophotonic couplers permit highly-efficient and polarization-independent coupling between photonic chips and external devices. They have been adopted for fibre-chip coupling in volume optoelectronic chip manufacturing. These coupling interfaces are particularly important because every photonic chip needs to be optically connected with the external world and the chips themselves appear in many established and emerging applications, such as 5G networks, data center interconnects, chip-to-chip interconnects, metro- and long-haul telecommunication systems, and automotive navigation.

In addition to the foregoing, photonic crystals have been proposed as platforms for the development of solar cells and optical sensors, including chemical sensors and biosensors.
