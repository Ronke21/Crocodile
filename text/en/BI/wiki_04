<text>Conway Cemetery Historic State Park, officially the Conway Cemetery State Park, is the final resting place of James S. Conway, first governor of Arkansas, and his wife, Mary J. Conway. It is a Arkansas state park in Lafayette County. No recreational or visitors&#x27; amenities are available at the state park.

==Description and administrative history==
The Conway-Johnson family dominated Arkansas politics from territorial days until the American Civil War. James Sevier Conway was the first governor of Arkansas, serving from 1836 to 1840. He began many basic state programs, such as banks, roads, and prisons. Conway retired to his plantation near Bradley, where he died in 1855. Several other prominent figures in early Arkansas politics were buried in the cemetery, including U.S. Senator Ambrose Hundley Sevier.

Locals succeeded in acquiring state protection of the site with the passing of legislation acquiring the site in 1975. After receiving listing on the National Register of Historic Places two years later, the cemetery was given to the Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism on March 27, 1984. After paving of a parking lot and addition of picnic tables, the park was admitted to the park system in 1986. The park encompasses the old homesite and family cemetery of the Conway family.

<doc id="339945" wikidata="Q27226" url="?curid=339945" title="Tawny pipit">
<text>The tawny pipit (Anthus campestris) is a medium-large passerine bird which breeds in much of the central Palearctic from northwest Africa and Portugal to Central Siberia and on to Inner Mongolia. It is a migrant moving in winter to tropical Africa and the Indian Subcontinent.
==Taxonomy==
The tawny pipit was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the larks and pipits in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Alauda campestris&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but this has been restricted to Sweden. The specific epithet &quot;campestris&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;of the fields&quot;, from &quot;campus&quot; meaning &quot;field&quot;. The tawny pipit is now one of over 40 species placed in the genus &quot;Anthus&quot; that was introduced in 1805 by German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
This is a large pipit, long with wing-span , but is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly sandy brown above and pale below. It is very similar to Richard&#x27;s pipit, but is slightly smaller, has shorter wings, tail and legs and a narrower dark bill. It is also less streaked. Its flight is strong and direct, and it gives a characteristic &quot;schip&quot; call, higher pitched than Richard&#x27;s.

Its song is a short repetition of a loud disyllabic &quot;chir-ree chir-ree&quot;.

In south Asia, in winter some care must be taken to distinguish this from other large pipits which winter or are resident in the area, including Richard&#x27;s pipit, Blyth&#x27;s pipit and paddyfield pipit.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
The breeding habitat is dry open country including semi-deserts. The nest is on the ground, with 3-6 eggs being laid. They are incubated mainly by the female until they hatch after around 12 days. The nestlings are fed by both parents.

===Food and feeding===
The tawny pipit is insectivorous, like its relatives.

==In culture==

The plot of the 1944 film &quot;Tawny Pipit&quot; is about the rare event of a pair of tawny pipits breeding in England. Eric Hosking&#x27;s footage of the pipits was actually of meadow pipits because he could not get genuine tawny pipits from German-occupied Europe.

<text>The red-throated pipit (Anthus cervinus) is a small passerine bird, which breeds in the far north of Europe and the Palearctic, with a foothold in northern Alaska. It is a long-distance migrant, moving in winter to Africa, South and East Asia and the West Coast United States. It is a vagrant to Western Europe.

==Etymology==
The scientific name is from Latin. The generic name &quot;Anthus&quot; is the name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific 
 name &quot;cervinus&quot; means &quot;stag-coloured&quot;, from &quot;cervus&quot;, &quot;stag&quot;.

==Description==
This is a small pipit, with an adult easily identified in the breeding season by its brick-red face and throat. In other plumages, this is an undistinguished-looking species, heavily streaked brown above, with whitish mantle stripes, and with black markings on a white background below. It is very similar in appearance to the meadow pipit, and in the autumn, it much resembles the tree pipit, but has an altogether more striped appearance because of the larger numbers of streaks on the cap, back, flank, rump, and chest. The flight of the red-throated pipit is strong and direct, and it gives a characteristic &quot;psii&quot; call as it flies.

==Behaviour==

The red-throated pipit is native to the boreal regions of Northern Europe and Asia. The breeding habitat is open country including mountains, marshland, and tundra. The nest is built on the ground, often beside a tussock of grass, on rough grassland, or on a hummock in a marsh. It is made of dry grasses and sedges with a soft lining of reindeer hair or down. Four to six eggs are laid and incubated by the female for nearly two weeks. The young are fledged and ready to leave the nest about 12 days later. The red-throated pipit is insectivorous, like its relatives, but also eats seeds.

==Status==

The red-throated pipit has a very large range and the global population has been estimated to be about two million individuals. It is rated as being of least concern by the IUCN, as its population is believed to be stable, and it faces no particular threats.

<doc id="339953" wikidata="Q548135" url="?curid=339953" title="Coolie">
<text>Coolie (also spelled koelie, kouli, khuli, khulie, kuli, cooli, cooly, or quli) is a pejorative term used for low-wage labourers, typically those of Indian or Chinese descent.

The word &quot;coolie&quot; was first used in the 16th century by European traders across Asia. In the 18th century, the term more commonly referred to migrant Indian indentured labourers. In the 19th century, during the British colonial era, the term was adopted for the transportation and employment of Asian labourers via employment contracts on sugar plantations formerly worked by enslaved Africans.

The word has had a variety of negative implications. In modern-day English; it is usually regarded as offensive. In the 21st century, &quot;coolie&quot; is generally considered a racial slur for Asians in Oceania, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Americas; particularly in the Caribbean.

The word originated in the 17th-century Indian subcontinent and meant &quot;day labourer&quot;; starting in the 20th century, the word was used in British Raj India to refer to porters at railway stations. The term differs from the word &quot;Dougla&quot;, which refers to people of mixed African and Indian ancestry. &quot;Coolie&quot; is instead used to refer to people of fully-blooded Indian descent whose ancestors migrated to the British former colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. This is particularly so in South Africa, Eastern African countries, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, other parts of the Caribbean, Mauritius, Fiji, and the Malay Peninsula.

In modern Indian popular culture, coolies have often been portrayed as working-class heroes or anti-heroes. Indian films celebrating coolies include &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975), &quot;Coolie&quot; (1983), and several films titled &quot;Coolie No. 1&quot; (released in 1991, 1995, and 2020). A new Tamil movie titled &quot;Coolie&quot; starring Rajinikanth is set to release in 2025.

== Etymology ==
It is generally understood that the term comes from the Hindi and Telugu word &quot;kulī&quot; (), , meaning &quot;day-labourer&quot;, which is probably associated with the Urdu word &quot;quli&quot; (), meaning &quot;slave&quot;. The Urdu word is thought to come from the Tamil word &quot;kulī&quot; (&quot;hire&quot; or &quot;hireling&quot;). The word &quot;kūli&quot;, meaning &quot;wages&quot;, is present throughout the Dravidian language family, with the exception of the North Dravidian branch.

It is also thought that the Hindi word &quot;qulī&quot; could have originated from the name of a Gujarati aboriginal tribe or caste.

The Chinese word is an instance of phono-semantic matching that literally translates to &quot;bitter strength&quot; but is more commonly understood as &quot;hard labour&quot;.

In 1727, Engelbert Kämpfer described &quot;coolies&quot; as dock labourers who would unload Dutch merchant ships at Nagasaki in Japan.

=== Classification as an offensive term ===
&quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; classifies the term &quot;coolie&quot; as &quot;usually offensive&quot;. &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states it is &quot;dated, offensive&quot;. &quot;Dictionary.com&quot; considers it &quot;disparaging and offensive&quot;.

==History of the coolie trade==

=== Abolition of slavery and rise of the coolie trade ===
The importation of Asian labourers into European colonies occurred as early as the 17th century. However, in the 19th century, a far more robust system of trade involving coolies occurred, in direct response to the gradual abolition of both the Atlantic slave trade and slavery itself, which for centuries had served as the preferred mode of labour in European colonies in the Americas. The British were the first to experiment with coolie labour when, in 1806, two hundred Chinese labourers were transported to the colony of Trinidad to work on the plantations there. The &quot;Trinidad experiment&quot; was not a success, with only twenty to thirty labourers remaining in Trinidad by the 1820s. However, such efforts inspired Sir John Gladstone, one of the earliest proponents of coolie labour, to seek out coolies for his sugar plantations in British Guiana in the hopes of replacing his Afro-Caribbean labour force after the abolition of slavery there in 1833.

Social and political pressure led to the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire in 1833, with other European nations eventually following suit. Labour-intensive work in European colonies, such as those involving plantations and mines, were left without a cheap source of manpower. As a consequence, a large-scale trade of primarily Indian and Chinese indentured labourers began in the 1820s to fill this need. In 1838, 396 South Asian workers arrived in British Guiana, and such a stream of migrant labour would continue until the First World War. Other European nations, especially colonial powers such as France, Spain, and Portugal, soon followed suit, especially as Britain, through several treaties such as Strangford Treaty and the Treaty of Paris of 1814, also pressured other nations to abolish their involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. In most European colonies, the importation of Asian labourers began in earnest after the abolition of slavery. However, in some colonies, such as Cuba, slavery would not end until 1886, about forty years after coolies were introduced.

A number of contemporary and modern historians noted the influence of the old form of colonial slavery on the coolie system. The coolie trade, much like the slave trade, was intended to provide a labour force for colonial plantations in the Americas and the Pacific whose cash crops were in high demand across the Atlantic World. Coolies frequently worked on slave plantations which had been previously worked by enslaved Africans, and similarly brutal treatment could be meted out by plantation overseers in response to real or perceived offences. On some Caribbean plantations, the numbers of coolies present could reach up to six hundred. In 1878, historian W. L. Distant wrote an article for the &quot;Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute&quot;, detailing his time spent on West Indian plantations observing the work ethic and behaviours of coolies, and noted that many overseers believed that Asian coolies, much like enslaved Africans, held an affinity for intensive outdoor labour work. The views of overseers towards coolies differed based on ethnicity: Chinese and Japanese coolies were perceived to be harder working, more unified as a labour force, and maintained better hygiene habits in comparison to Indian labourers, who were viewed as being lower in status and treated as children who required constant supervision.

=== Debates over coolie labour ===
Unlike slavery, coolie labour was (in theory) under contract, consensual, paid, and temporary, with the coolie able to regain complete freedom after their term of service. Regulations were put in place as early as 1837 by the British authorities in India to safeguard these principles of voluntary, contractual work and safe, sanitary transportation. The Chinese government also made efforts to secure the well-being of their nation&#x27;s workers, with representatives being sent to relevant governments around the world. Some Western abolitionists saw coolie labour as paving the way towards abolition, to gradually and peacefully replace African slave labour without loss of profit. However, other abolitionist groups and individuals – such as the British Anti-Slavery Society and the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, along with American abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison – were highly critical of coolie labour. Proslavery advocates, particularly in the Southern United States, condemned coolie labour but used it to argue against the abolition of American slavery, claiming the latter was more &quot;humane&quot; than the former.

In practice, however, as many opponents of the system argued, abuse and violence in the coolie trade was rampant. Some of these labourers signed employment contracts based on misleading promises, while others were kidnapped and sold into servitude; some were victims of clan violence whose captors sold them to coolie merchants, while others sold themselves to pay off gambling debts. Those who did sign on voluntarily generally had contracts of two to five years. In addition to having their passage paid for, coolies were also paid under twenty cents per day on average. However, in certain regions, roughly a dollar would be taken from coolies every month in order to pay off their debts.

=== Chinese coolies ===

==== In European colonies ====
Workers from China were mainly transported to work in Peru and Cuba. However, many Chinese labourers worked in British colonies such as Singapore, New South Wales, Jamaica, British Guiana (now Guyana), British Malaya, Trinidad and Tobago, British Honduras (now Belize), as well as in the Dutch colonies within the Dutch East Indies and Suriname. The first shipment of Chinese labourers was to the British colony of Trinidad in 1806 &quot;in an attempt to establish a settlement of free peasant cultivators and labourers&quot;. On many of the voyages, the labourers were transported on the same vessels that had been used to transport African slaves in previous years.

The coolie slave trade run by American captains and local agents, mainly consisting of debt slavery, was called the &#x27;pig trade&#x27; as the living conditions were not dissimilar to that of livestock; on some vessels as many as 40 per cent of the coolies died en route. As many as 500 were crammed into a single ship hold, leaving no room to move. The coolies were also stamped on their backs like livestock. Foreign merchants took advantage of the unequal treaties negotiated between the Qing government and Western powers after the Opium Wars, as well as the resulting political and economic instability, to broker deals for &quot;contracted&quot; workers. Anglophone capitalists referred to the opium trade and captive Chinese labour as &quot;poison and pigs&quot;.

Portuguese Macao was the center of coolie slavery: it was described as &quot;the only real business&quot; in Macao from 1848 to 1873, generating enormous profits for the Portuguese until it was banned due to pressure from the British government. Between 1851 and 1874 approximately 215,000 Chinese were shipped from Macau overseas, primarily to Cuba and Peru, with some being shipped to Guiana, Suriname, and Costa Rica. These coolies were obtained via a variety of sources, including some who were entrapped by brokers in Macau through loans for gambling, and others who were kidnapped or coerced.

In 1847, two ships from Cuba transported workers to Havana to work in the sugar cane fields from the port of Xiamen, one of the five Chinese treaty ports opened to the British by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The trade soon spread to other ports in Guangdong, and demand became particularly strong in Peru for workers in the silver mines and the guano collecting industry. Australia began importing workers in 1848. These workers were deceived about their terms of employment to a much greater extent than their Indian counterparts, and consequently, there was a much higher level of Chinese emigration during this period.
The trade flourished from 1847 to 1854 without incident, until reports began to surface of the mistreatment of the workers in Cuba and Peru. As the British government had political and legal responsibility for many of the ports involved – including Amoy – such ports were immediately closed. Despite these closures, the trade simply shifted to the more accommodating port within the Portuguese enclave of Macau.

Many coolies were first deceived or kidnapped, and then kept in barracoons (detention centres) or loading vessels in the ports of departure, as were African slaves. Their voyages, which are sometimes called the Pacific Passage, were as inhumane and dangerous as the notorious Middle Passage of the Atlantic slave trade. Mortality was very high; it is estimated that from 1847 to 1859, the average mortality rate for coolies aboard ships to Cuba was 15.2%, and losses among ships to Peru were as high as 40% in the 1850s, and 30.4% from 1860 to 1863.

Coolies were sold and taken to work in plantations or mines with very bad living and working conditions. The duration of a contract was typically five to eight years, but many coolies did not live out their term of service due to hard labour and mistreatment. Survivors were often forced to remain in servitude beyond the contracted period. The &quot;1860 Reglamento para la introducción de trabajadores chinos a la isla de Cuba&quot; (Regulation for the Introduction of Chinese Workers to the Island of Cuba) passed in Cuba. This regulation stipulated that the Coolie workers must recontract with their previous employer or another employer or they must leave Cuba at their own expense within 2 months after the end of their contract. Coolies were usually unable to afford to leave Cuba and were forced to recontract. This regulation blurred the distinction between indentured servitude and slavery. It allowed for the Coolies to serve as a source of semi-captive labour given the intentional difficulty of returning home.

The coolies who worked on the sugar plantations in Cuba and in the guano beds of the Chincha Islands (&#x27;the islands of Hell&#x27;) of Peru were treated brutally. 75% of the Chinese coolies in Cuba died before fulfilling their contracts. More than two-thirds of the Chinese coolies who arrived in Peru between 1849 and 1874 died within the contract period. In 1860, it was calculated that of the 4,000 coolies brought to the Chinchas since the trade began, not one had survived.

Because of these unbearable conditions, Chinese coolies often revolted against their Ko-Hung bosses and foreign company bosses at ports of departure, on ships, and in foreign lands. The coolies were put in the same neighbourhoods as Africans and, since most were unable to return to their homeland or have their wives come to the New World, many married African women. The coolies&#x27; interracial relationships and marriages with Africans, Europeans, and Indigenous peoples, formed some of the modern world&#x27;s Afro-Asian and Asian Latin American populations.

In Spanish, coolies were referred to as (&#x27;Asian colonists&#x27;). The Spanish colony of Cuba feared slave uprisings such as those that took place in Haiti, and used coolies as a transition between slaves and free labour. They were neither free nor slaves. Indentured Chinese servants also laboured in the sugarcane fields of Cuba well after the 1884 abolition of slavery in the country. Two scholars of Chinese labour in Cuba, Juan Pastrana and Juan Pérez de la Riva, substantiated horrific conditions of Chinese coolies in Cuba and stated that coolies were slaves in all but name. Researcher Denise Helly believes that despite their slave-like treatment, the free and legal status of the Asian labourers in Cuba separated them from slaves. According to Rodriguez Pastor and Trazegnies Granda, the coolies could challenge their superiors, run away, petition government officials, and rebel.

By 1870, labour contractors called enganchadores were used to manage and negotiate the contracts for Chinese Coolies in organised labour squads called Cuadrillas. &quot;The enganchador negotiated all terms of work for his squad and handled all aspects of employment for the workers, including obtaining advances from the planters for salaries, distributing tools, arranging housing and food, and assuming responsibility for discipline, control, and supervision.&quot; (Hu-DeHart). The enganchador had flexibility in the length of the Coolies&#x27; recontract. The Coolie was also able to negotiate their wages and often had the upper hand as the employer had to yield to market forces. &quot;Recontracting terms varied considerably. A batch of recontracts from the period 1863 to 1877 reveals great variation in the terms of the new contracts, diverging not only from the original ones, but from each other. First, most coolies signed up for only one year, at most two years, and some for as few as three and six months – all far short of another eight years. Second, the monthly wages not only varied, but were always greater than the 4 pesos in the original contracts, in some cases significantly greater. Many specified payment in &quot;peso fuerte,&quot; that is, hard currency, not vouchers, which was often used during the eight year original indenture.&quot; (Hu-DeHart).

Once they had fulfilled their contracts, &quot;&quot; integrated into the countries of Peru, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. They adopted cultural traditions from the natives and welcomed non-Chinese to experience and participate in their traditions. Before the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Havana had Latin America&#x27;s largest Chinatown.

From , the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company was instrumental in supplying Chinese coolie labour to South African mines at the request of mine owners, who considered such labour cheaper than native African and white labour. The horrendous conditions suffered by Indian coolie labourers in South Africa led some politicians in the British Parliament to question the coolie system.

In 1866, the British, French and Chinese governments agreed to mitigate the abuse by requiring all traders to pay for the return of all workers after their contract ended. The employers in the British West Indies declined these conditions, bringing the trade there to an end. Until the trade was finally abolished in 1875, over 150,000 coolies had been sold to Cuba alone, the majority having been shipped from Macau. These labourers endured conditions far worse than those experienced by their Indian counterparts. Even after the 1866 reforms, the scale of abuse and conditions of near slavery did not get any better – if anything they deteriorated. In the early 1870s, an increased media exposure of the trade led to a public outcry, and the British, as well as the Chinese government, put pressure on the Portuguese colonial authorities in Macau to bring the trade there to an end; this was ultimately achieved in 1874. By that time, a total of up to half a million Chinese workers had been exported. However, by 1890, there were still newspaper reports of coolie labour being used in Madagascar.

The term &quot;coolie&quot; was also applied to Chinese workers recruited for contracts on cacao plantations in German Samoa. German planters went to great lengths to secure access to their coolie labour supply from China. In 1908, a Chinese commissioner, Lin Shu Fen, reported on the cruel treatment of coolie workers on German plantations in the western Samoan Islands. The trade began largely after the establishment of colonial German Samoa in 1900 and lasted until the arrival of New Zealand forces in 1914. More than 2,000 Chinese coolies were present in the islands in 1914 and most were eventually repatriated by the New Zealand administration.

==== In the United States ====
Debates over coolie labour and slavery was key in shaping the history of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. In February 1862, &quot;An Act to Prohibit the &#x27;Coolie Trade&#x27; by American Citizens in American vessels&quot;, also known as the Anti-Coolie Act, was signed into law by Abraham Lincoln, which prohibited any U.S. citizens and residents from trading in Chinese subjects, known as &quot;coolies&quot;. In one aspect, the Anti-Coolie Act was the last of the U.S. slave trade laws, as well as the beginning of the end of slavery; in September of that year, Lincoln would also issue the Emancipation Proclamation. In another aspect, it was the beginning of Chinese exclusion in the U.S. and the beginning of federal immigration restriction. Within a decade, significant levels of anti-Chinese sentiment had built up, stoked by populists such as Denis Kearney with racist slogans – &quot;To an American, death is preferable to life on a par with the Chinese.&quot;

In 1868, the Burlingame Treaty would ensure certain protections for Chinese immigrants in the U.S. and emphasise that any Chinese immigration to the U.S. must be free and voluntary, reaffirming that &quot;coolies&quot;, being unfree, were unwelcome and prohibited from entering the U.S. In 1875, Congress passed the Page Act, which prohibited the bringing of any Chinese subjects without their consent in order to hold them for a term of service. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act barred the entry of any Chinese labourer to the U.S.

Despite attempts to restrict the influx of cheap labour from China, beginning in the 1870s Chinese workers helped construct a vast network of levees in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. These levees made thousands of acres of fertile marshlands available for agricultural production. Although Chinese workers contributed to the building of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States and of the Canadian Pacific Railway in western Canada, Chinese settlement was discouraged after completion of the construction. State legislation, such as California&#x27;s Foreign Miners&#x27; Tax Act of 1850 and 1852, would target Chinese immigrants in the U.S. The 1879 Constitution of California declared that &quot;Asiatic coolieism is a form of human slavery, and is forever prohibited in this State, and all contracts for coolie labour shall be void.&quot;

In 1938, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the term in one of his fireside chats (Number 13, 24 July 1938) while telling a story about &quot;two Chinese coolies&quot; arguing in a crowd.

==== In South America ====
In South America, Chinese indentured labourers worked in Peru&#x27;s silver mines and coastal industries (i.e., guano, sugar, and cotton) from the early 1850s to the mid-1870s; about 100,000 people immigrated as indentured workers. They participated in the War of the Pacific, looting and burning down the haciendas where they worked after the capture of Lima by the invading Chilean army in January 1880. Some 2,000 coolies even joined the Chilean Army in Peru, taking care of the wounded and burying the dead. Others were sent by Chileans to work in the newly conquered nitrate fields.

===Indian coolies===

By the 1820s, many Indians were voluntarily enlisting to go abroad for work, in the hopes of a better life. European merchants and businessmen quickly took advantage of this and began recruiting them for work as a cheap source of labour. British merchants began transporting Indians to colonies around the world, including Mauritius, Fiji, New South Wales, Natal, Kenya, Tanganyika, Somaliland, Bechuanaland, Seychelles, Uganda, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, British Guiana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, British Honduras, Barbados, the rest of the British West Indies, and British Malaya. The Dutch shipped workers to labour on the plantations on Surinam, the Netherlands Antilles, and the Dutch East Indies. The French shipped labourers to Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, the rest of the French West Indies, and Réunion.

A system of agents was used to infiltrate the rural villages of India and recruit labourers. They would often deceive the credulous workers about the great opportunities that awaited them for their own material betterment abroad. The Indians primarily came from the Indo-Gangetic Plain, but also from Tamil Nadu and other areas to the south of the country. Indians had faced a great number of social and economic disasters, causing them to be more eager than other groups to leave India. In the last part of the nineteenth century alone, there were 24 famines.

Without permission from the British colonial authorities, the French transported Indian workers to their Pacific colony, Réunion, from as early as 1826. By 1830, over 3,000 labourers had been transported. After this trade was discovered, the French successfully negotiated with the British in 1860 for permission to transport over 6,000 workers annually, on condition that the trade would be suspended if abuses were discovered to be taking place.

The British began to transport Indians to Mauritius starting in 1829. Slavery was abolished there in 1833, with Mauritian planters receiving two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves. The planters turned to bringing in a large number of indentured labourers from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport, and on construction sites.

In 1837, the British East India Company issued a set of regulations for the trade. The rules provided for each labourer to be personally authorised for transportation by an officer designated by the company, limited the length of service to five years subject to voluntary renewal, made the contractor responsible for returning the worker after the contract elapsed, and required the vessels to conform to basic health standards.

Despite this, conditions on the ships were often extremely crowded, with rampant disease and malnutrition. Coolies were also not informed about the length of the trip or about the island that they would be going to. The workers were paid a pittance for their labour, and were expected to work in often awful and harsh conditions. Although there were no large-scale scandals involving coolie abuse in British colonies, workers often ended up being forced to work, and manipulated in such a way that they became dependent on the plantation owners so that in practice they remained there long after their contracts expired; possibly as little as 10% of the coolies actually returned to their original country of origin. Colonial legislation was also passed to severely limit their freedoms; in Mauritius, a compulsory pass system was instituted to enable their movements to be easily tracked. Conditions were much worse in the French colonies of Réunion, Guadeloupe, and Martinique, where workers were &#x27;systematically overworked&#x27; and abnormally high mortality rates were recorded for those working in the mines. Generally, Indian coolies were noted to have higher mortality rates as a whole, and were less likely to be able to return home. Companies would often promise good food, durable clothing, adequate housing, safe passage, and schools. However, these promises were rarely kept, leading to the higher mortality rate and image of Indian coolies being &quot;dirty&quot;.

The voyage itself was often a highly dangerous venture, especially for coolie women. Though some ships had made attempts to prevent assault, rape, and general mistreatment in sailor contracts, these crimes were still common. Even with punishments in place, on ship and land, men who assaulted women and children were rarely punished, leaving women in an even more vulnerable position.

However, there were also attempts by the British authorities to regulate and mitigate the worst abuses. Workers were regularly checked up on by health inspectors, and they were vetted before transportation to ensure that they were suitably healthy and fit to be able to endure the rigours of labour. Children under the age of 15 were not allowed to be transported from their parents under any circumstances.

The first campaign in England against the coolie trade likened the system of indentured labour to the slavery of the past. The campaign against coolie emigration was led by Joseph Sturge, with the Society of Friends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens of entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices. In response to this pressure, the labour export was temporarily stopped in 1839 by the authorities when the scale of the abuses became known, but it was soon renewed due to its growing economic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put into place and severe penalties were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were shipped to Mauritius.

In 1844, the trade was expanded to the colonies in the West Indies, including Jamaica, Trinidad, and Demerara, where the Asian population was soon a major component of the island demographic.

Starting in 1879, many Indians were transported to Fiji to work on the sugarcane plantations. Many of them chose to stay after their term of indenture elapsed, and today their descendants account for about 40% of the total population. Indian workers were also imported into the Dutch colony of Surinam after the Dutch signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers in 1870. In Mauritius, the Indian population is now demographically dominant, with Indian festivals being celebrated as national holidays.

This system prevailed until the early twentieth century. Increasing focus on the brutalities and abuses of the trade by the sensationalist media of the time incited public outrage and led to the official ending of the coolie trade in 1916 by the British government. By that time, tens of thousands of Chinese workers were being used along the Western Front by the allied forces (see Chinese Labour Corps).

===Sex ratios and intermarriage among coolies===

A major difference between the Chinese and Indian coolie trades was that women and children were brought from India, along with men, while Chinese coolies were 99% male. Although there are reports of ships (so called &#x27;coolie ships&#x27;) for Asian coolies carrying women and children, the great majority of them carried men. This led to a high rate of Chinese men marrying women of other ethnicities, such as Indian women and mixed-race Creole women.

The contrast in the female-to-male ratio between Indian and Chinese immigrants has been compared by historians. In Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies, just 18,731 Chinese women and 92,985 Chinese men served as coolies on plantations. Chinese women migrated less than Javanese and Indian women as indentured coolies. The number of Chinese women as coolies was &quot;very small&quot; while Chinese men were easily taken into the coolie trade. In Cuba, men made up the vast majority of Chinese indentured servants on sugar plantations; in Peru, non-Chinese women married the mostly male Chinese coolies. Polyandry was a common practice among Indian coolies. Between 1845 and 1917, twenty-five per cent of all Indians brought to the Caribbean were women. With women as a severe minority, their morality was questioned and the actions of men as a result of having so few women was blamed on the women. Between 1858 and 1859, laws were put into place stating that the ratio of men to women could not exceed 2:1, whereas before it was 3:1. However, there continued to be a severe shortage of women. This gave women a new sense of power when it came to choosing a partner. With a shortage of women, it became the responsibility of the male suitor to provide a hefty dowry to a woman&#x27;s father, regardless of what caste she came from. Unfortunately, this also put women in a very vulnerable position, especially when alone. Rape was a common occurrence, and there were accounts of women being bound and gagged in their own homes by men. Between 1872 and 1900, it was reported that 87 women were murdered, with 65 of those being married women who were accused of being unfaithful.

The scarcity of Indian women in the Caribbean may not have been completely due to the women&#x27;s inability to perform the work required of them. Many coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn made it much more difficult for women to emigrate, partially because an agent was usually needed to travel to the woman&#x27;s village to verify her identity.

Chinese women were scarce in every place where Chinese indentured labourers were brought; the migration was dominated by Chinese men. Up to the 1940s, men made up the vast majority of the Costa Rican Chinese community. Similarly, males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico, and they often married Mexican women.

One stark difference between Indian and Chinese coolies was the treatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage. Crimes against women (including murder) were far more frequent among Indian coolies. This was simply because there were so few Chinese women. However, it became common for people to instead believe that Indians murder their women while Chinese women stay alive because, unlike their Indian counterparts, they are chaste.

In the early 1900s, the Chinese communities in Manila, Singapore, Mauritius, New Zealand, Victoria in Australia, the United States, and Victoria in British Columbia in Canada were all male dominated. Though the lack of women became a problem in later years, initially women were not a high priority during coolie recruitment. Generally, it was believed that women were unwilling to perform the hard outdoor labour. Those willing to perform it were still seen as not as good as men.

Some Chinese coolies managed to avoid racial discrimination laws in Cuba and marry white women. This could be done by being listed as &#x27;white&#x27; on their baptism certificates, as the agency that recruited them was meant for settling white people in Cuba. A Chinese coolie in Cuba also mentioned a white female master in a deposition.

===Legislation===
In 2000, the parliament of South Africa enacted the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000. Section 10 covers the prohibition of hate speech terms, such as &#x27;coolie&#x27; (koelie). The main objectives of the Act were:

==Modern use==

* In Indonesian, &quot;kuli&quot; is most commonly for unskilled workers relying on their physical strength for transporting goods. It was previously used to refer to Indian or Chinese labourers, with a pejorative connotation.
* In India, the Hindi word &quot;qūlī&quot; is now commonly used to refer to luggage porters at hotel lobbies and railway and bus stations. Nevertheless, the use of such (especially by foreigners) may still be regarded as a slur by some. The phrase &#x27;brown coolie&#x27; is a term used for an Indian citizen who is posturing as a representative to a foreign institute.
* In Malaysia, &quot;kuli&quot; is a term for manual labourers, with somewhat negative connotations.
* In Thai, &quot;kuli&quot; (กุลี) still retains its original meaning as manual labourers, but is considered to be offensive. In September 2005, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand used this term when referring to the labourers who built the new international airport. He thanked them for their hard work. Reuters, a news source from Bangkok, reported that Thai labour groups were angered by his use of the term.
* In South Africa, the term &quot;coolie&quot; referred to indentured workers from India. It is no longer an accepted term, and both it and its Zulu version, &quot;amakhula&quot;, are considered extremely derogatory for people of Indian descent.
* In Ethiopia, &quot;cooli&quot; are those who carry heavy loads for someone. However, the word is not a slur. It refers to Arab day-labourers who migrated to Ethiopia for labour work.
* The Dutch word &quot;koelie&quot; refers to a worker who performs very hard, exacting labour. The word generally has no particular ethnic connotations among the Dutch, but it is a racial slur among Surinamese of Indian heritage.
* In Vietnamese, since the French Indochina era, &quot;cu li&quot; or &quot;culi&quot;, as a Vietnamese pronunciation for coolie, is still used with the offensive mearning for low-paid labourer.
* In Finland, when freshmen of a technical university take care of student union club tasks (usually arranging a party or such activity), they are referred as &quot;kuli&quot; or performing a &quot;kuli duty&quot;.
* In Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Jamaica, Belize, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Barbados, Virgin Islands, other parts of the Caribbean, Mauritius, South Africa, Seychelles, other parts of Southeast Africa, Fiji, Singapore, and Malaysia, &quot;coolie&quot; was used loosely to refer to anyone of Indian and South Asian descent and is considered an offensive pejorative.
* In some English-speaking countries, the conical hat worn by many Asians, to protect themselves from the sun, is sometimes called a &quot;coolie hat&quot;.
* In the information technology industry, offshore workers are sometimes referred to as coolies because of their lower wages.
* The term &quot;coolie&quot; appears in the Eddy Howard song, &quot;The Rickety Rickshaw Man&quot;.
* In Hungarian, &quot;kulimunka&quot; () refers to back-breaking, repetitive work.
* In Sri Lanka, &quot;kuliwada&quot; is the Sinhala term for manual labour. Also, &quot;kuli&quot; (e.g. &quot;kuliyata&quot;) means working for a fee, notably instant (cash) payment (and not salaried). It is used in a derogatory or jesting manner to signify biased action or support (e.g. &quot;Kuliyata andanawa&quot; means &quot;Crying for a fee&quot;, since in colonial times people would be paid to cry at funerals). Taxis are known as &quot;kuli-ratha&quot;.
* In Filipino, &quot;makuli&quot; translates to &quot;industrious&quot;, which carries connotations of slavishness.
* In Greek, &quot;κούλης&quot; is used as a neutral word to mean &quot;ship worker of Asian origin&quot; by the Greek poet Nikos Kavvadias.

==In art, entertainment, and media==
===Films===

&quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975) is an Indian crime drama written by Salim–Javed about a dockyard coolie, Vijay Verma (Amitabh Bachchan), who turns to a life of crime and becomes a Bombay underworld smuggler, inspired by the real-life Indian mafia don Haji Mastan. &quot;Coolie&quot; (1983) is an Indian Bollywood film about a coolie, Iqbal Aslam Khan (Amitabh Bachchan), who works at a railway station; the film is famous for the fact that during filming, Bachchan suffered a near-fatal injury during a fight sequence. Additional Indian films about coolies include &quot;Coolie No. 1&quot; (1991), &quot;Coolie&quot; (1995), &quot;Coolie No. 1&quot; (1995), &quot;Coolie&quot; (2004), &quot;Coolie No. 1&quot; (2019), and &quot;Coolie No. 1&quot; (2020).

===Music===
The 2014 chutney song titled &quot;Coolie Bai Dance&quot; by the Indo-Guyanese singer Romeo &quot;Mystic&quot; Nermal is about the lifestyle of the traditional &quot;coolie&quot; (Indo-Caribbean) villagers in Guyana and the rest of the Caribbean.

<doc id="339955" wikidata="Q221230" url="?curid=339955" title="Nip/Tuck">
<text>Nip/Tuck is an American medical drama television series created by Ryan Murphy that aired on FX in the United States for six seasons from 2003 to 2010. The series, which also incorporates elements of crime, black comedy, family drama, satire, and psychological thriller, focuses on &quot;McNamara/Troy&quot;, a cutting-edge, controversial plastic surgery center, and follows the personal and professional lives of its founders Dr. Sean McNamara and Dr. Christian Troy (portrayed by Dylan Walsh and Julian McMahon, respectively). Each episode features graphic, partial depictions of the plastic surgeries on one or more patients, as well as developments in the doctors&#x27; personal lives. Focus is also given to McNamara/Troy&#x27;s anesthesiologist Dr. Liz Cruz, Christian&#x27;s many sexual partners, and Sean&#x27;s family. With the exception of the pilot, each episode of the series is named after one of the patients scheduled to receive plastic surgery.

Unlike most medical dramas, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; used serial storytelling and often had story arcs spanning multiple seasons; for example, seasons two and three focused on a serial rapist known as The Carver, who often mutilates his victims&#x27; faces, leading McNamara/Troy to provide &quot;pro bono&quot; surgery to the victims.

The show premiered on July 22, 2003, and concluded on March 3, 2010, with the 100th episode. Despite being initially set in Miami, at the end of the fourth season, it was relocated to Los Angeles, and many of the characters followed along. The show earned 45 award nominations, winning one Golden Globe and one Emmy Award. Series creator Ryan Murphy said that the medical cases on the show are &quot;100 percent based on fact&quot;.

==Overview==
The drama is set in a plastic-surgery center, McNamara/Troy, centering on the two doctors who own it. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) is often found having problems at home due to being seduced by beautiful women on a daily basis, and thus tries to keep his family together by patching up the rocky road in which his family and himself are living. Partner Christian Troy (Julian McMahon), though, uses his charm to bring in potential female candidates and conducts vain business deals, almost never failing to end up with them in bed. Sean takes his job seriously and often must fix Christian&#x27;s mistakes.

==Production==
According to Ryan Murphy, the series was inspired by makeover episodes of the talk shows &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

In its debut season, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; was the highest-rated new series on American basic cable, and the highest-rated basic cable series of all time for the 18–49 and 25–54 age demographics. 

The fifth season premiered on October 30, 2007, though production was affected by the 2007 Writers Strike. Accordingly, the second half of the fifth season was not screened until January 6, 2009, in the U.S. Another 19 episodes were picked up by FX; airing on October 14, 2009. Following a three-week hiatus for the Christmas holidays, the show resumed in January 2010, and concluded on March 3, 2010, with its 100th episode. 

&quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; filmed its 100th and final episode on June 12, 2009, without creator Ryan Murphy, who was, at the time, in India scouting locations for his film version of the memoir &quot;Eat, Pray, Love&quot;.

The show inspired the creation of the plastic-surgery reality show &quot;Dr. 90210&quot;.

==U.S. television ratings==
Viewer numbers (based on average total viewers per episode) of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; on FX.

&quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; became an instant cable hit from its 2003 series premiere.

For its third season, FX aired &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; solely in the fall of 2005, instead of during the summer season, like the two years prior. John Landgraf, president of FX, stated that such a move was a &quot;huge risk&quot;, since it stacked up &quot;against the full barrage of fall network competition&quot;. Despite some criticism on its third season, the story arc involving The Carver attracted even more of an audience to the series than any of the seasons before, reaching its climax in a December 20, 2005, two-hour season finale, entitled &quot;Cherry Peck / Quentin Costa&quot;, which became the most-watched scripted program in the history of the FX network.

Including &quot;Cherry Peck / Quentin Costa&quot;, three episodes of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; rank as the three most-watched scripted programs ever on FX. The second-season finale, entitled &quot;Joan Rivers&quot;, which aired on October 5, 2004, drew 5.2 million viewers. It was then eclipsed on September 20, 2005, when the third-season premiere, entitled &quot;Momma Boone&quot;, drew roughly 5.3 million viewers. Three months later on December 20, 2005, the aforementioned third-season finale, entitled &quot;Cherry Peck / Quentin Costa&quot;, drew 5.7 million viewers. Of those 5.7 million viewers, 3.9 million were in the 18–49 age group demographic, &quot;making the finale the number-one episode among the key advertising demographic of any cable series in 2005. It&#x27;s also the largest demographic number for any single telecast in the network&#x27;s history,&quot; according to Zap2It.

According to the September 8, 2006, Mediaweek column &quot;The Programming Insider&quot;, &quot;the fourth-season premiere on Tuesday, September 5, 2006, averaged 4.8 million total viewers and 3.4 million adults 18–49, building over its season-three average by 25% and 26%, respectively. &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;″s performance among adults 18–49 ranks as basic cable&#x27;s top-rated season premiere in the demographic for 2006, as of September 8, 2006.&quot;

==Broadcast==

In Australia, the series was broadcast on Showcase and Nine Network; in Canada on CTV and Series+; in France on M6; in Ireland on TG4; in New Zealand on TV One, TV2 and Canterbury Television.

In the United Kingdom, Sky One acquired the series just a few weeks ahead of its US debut, on 8 July 2003, and premiered in the 10:00pm time slot on 13 January 2004. In August 2004, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; began airing on Channel 4, who had already acquired the free-to-air rights to the series before Sky announced they had the first-run pay TV rights. They only aired the first two seasons before dropping the show from its lineup. In 2007, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; moved from Sky One to the British version of the show&#x27;s home network, FX. It has also since aired on Sky Living.

In South Africa the show aired, after the actual running time, on SABC 3.

==International adaptation==
In 2013, the Colombian network Caracol TV produced the Spanish language adaptation of the series, titled &quot;Mentiras perfectas&quot; (&quot;Perfect Lies&quot;).

<doc id="339958" wikidata="Q837757" url="?curid=339958" title="Pechora pipit">
<text>The Pechora pipit (Anthus gustavi) is a small passerine bird which breeds in the East Palearctic tundra and densely vegetated areas near river banks ranges from the Pechora River to the Chukchi Peninsula. It also breeds in Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. It is a long-distance migrant, moving in winter to Indonesia. Rarely in September and October, the Pechora pipit may be observed in western Europe. The species was first described by Robert Swinhoe in 1863.

==Description==
&quot;A. gustavi&quot; is a small pipit, which somewhat resembles the non-breeding red-throated pipit. The species is heavily streaked brown above, with whitish mantle stripes, and with black markings on a white belly and buff breast below. It can be distinguished from red-throated by its heavier bill, whiter mantle stripes, and contrast between its buff breast and white belly.

This species creeps in long grass, and is reluctant to fly even when disturbed. Its call is a distinctive electrical &quot;zip&quot;. Although the call is generally helpful when identifying pipits, this species calls far less than most. This, combined with its skulking habits, makes this a difficult species to find and identify away from its breeding grounds in the Arctic.

Probably the best place in western Europe to see this rare species is Fair Isle, Shetland. The lack of cover on this small island makes skulking passerines easier to find.

The breeding habitat is damp tundra, open forest or marshland. The nest is on the ground, with four or five eggs being laid. This species is insectivorous, like its relatives.

==Etymology==

The genus name &quot;Anthus&quot; is from Latin and is the name for a small bird of grasslands. The specific &quot;gustavi&quot; commemorates the Dutch naturalist Gustaaf Schlegel.

The English name is derived from the Pechora River in northwest Russia.

<text>Pseudomonas is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the family Pseudomonadaceae in the class Gammaproteobacteria. The 348 members of the genus demonstrate a great deal of metabolic diversity and consequently are able to colonize a wide range of niches and hosts. Their ease of culture &quot;in vitro&quot; and availability of an increasing number of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; strain genome sequences has made the genus an excellent focus for scientific research; the best studied species include &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; in its role as an opportunistic human pathogen, the plant pathogen &quot;P. syringae&quot;, the soil bacterium &quot;P. putida&quot;, and the plant growth-promoting &quot;P. fluorescens, P. lini, P. migulae&quot;, and &quot;P. graminis&quot;.

Because of their widespread occurrence in water and plant seeds such as dicots, the pseudomonads were observed early in the history of microbiology. The generic name &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; created for these organisms was defined in rather vague terms by Walter Migula in 1894 and 1900 as a genus of Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and polar-flagellated bacteria with some sporulating species. The latter statement was later proved incorrect and was due to refractive granules of reserve materials. Despite the vague description, the type species, &quot;Pseudomonas pyocyanea&quot; (basionym of &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;), proved the best descriptor.

== Classification history ==
Like most bacterial genera, the pseudomonad last common ancestor lived hundreds of millions of years ago. They were initially classified at the end of the 19th century when first identified by Walter Migula. The etymology of the name was not specified at the time and first appeared in the seventh edition of &quot;Bergey&#x27;s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology&quot; (the main authority in bacterial nomenclature) as Greek &quot;pseudes &quot;(ψευδής) &quot;false&quot; and &quot;-monas&quot; (μονάς/μονάδος) &quot;a single unit&quot;, which can mean false unit; however, Migula possibly intended it as false &quot;Monas&quot;, a nanoflagellated protist (subsequently, the term &quot;monad&quot; was used in the early history of microbiology to denote unicellular organisms). Soon, other species matching Migula&#x27;s somewhat vague original description were isolated from many natural niches and, at the time, many were assigned to the genus. However, many strains have since been reclassified, based on more recent methodology and use of approaches involving studies of conservative macromolecules.

16S rRNA sequence analysis has redefined the taxonomy of many bacterial species. As a result, the genus &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; includes strains formerly classified in the genera &quot;Chryseomonas&quot; and &quot;Flavimonas&quot;. Other strains previously classified in the genus &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; are now classified in the genera &quot;Burkholderia&quot; and &quot;Ralstonia&quot;.

In 2020, a phylogenomic analysis of 494 complete &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; genomes identified two well-defined species (&quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;P. chlororaphis&quot;) and four wider phylogenetic groups (&quot;P. fluorescens, P. stutzeri, P. syringae, P. putida&quot;) with a sufficient number of available proteomes. The four wider evolutionary groups include more than one species, based on species definition by the Average Nucleotide Identity levels. In addition, the phylogenomic analysis identified several strains that were mis-annotated to the wrong species or evolutionary group. This mis-annotation problem has been reported by other analyses as well. In 2021, a broad phylogenomic analysis on this genus led to the reorganization of the species included in &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, leading to the creation of several new genera to accommodate some of them. 

== Genomics ==
In 2000, the complete genome sequence of a &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species was determined; more recently, the sequence of other strains has been determined, including &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; strains PAO1 (2000), &quot;P. putida&quot; KT2440 (2002), &quot;P. protegens&quot; Pf-5 (2005), &quot;P. syringae&quot; pathovar tomato DC3000 (2003), &quot;P. syringae&quot; pathovar syringae B728a (2005), &quot;P. syringae&quot; pathovar phaseolica 1448A (2005), &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; Pf0-1, and &quot;P. entomophila&quot; L48.

By 2016, more than 400 strains of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; had been sequenced. Sequencing the genomes of hundreds of strains revealed highly divergent species within the genus. In fact, many genomes of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; share only 50-60% of their genes, e.g. &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;P. putida&quot; share only 2971 proteins out of 5350 (or ~55%).

By 2020, more than 500 complete &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; genomes were available in Genebank. A phylogenomic analysis utilized 494 complete proteomes and identified 297 core orthologues, shared by all strains. This set of core orthologues at the genus level was enriched for proteins involved in metabolism, translation, and transcription and was utilized for generating a phylogenomic tree of the entire genus, to delineate the relationships among the &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; major evolutionary groups. In addition, group-specific core proteins were identified for most evolutionary groups, meaning that they were present in all members of the specific group, but absent in other pseudomonads. For example, several &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot;-specific core proteins were identified that are known to play an important role in this species&#x27; pathogenicity, such as &quot;CntL, CntM, PlcB, Acp1, MucE, SrfA, Tse1, Tsi2, Tse3,&quot; and &quot;EsrC&quot;.

In 2021, a comparative genomic study with more than 3000 &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; genomes helped to discover genes and functions related with the environmental adaptation of these bacteria.

== Characteristics ==
Members of the genus display these defining characteristics:
* Rod-shaped
* Gram-negative
* Flagellum one or more, providing motility
* Aerobic
* Non-spore forming
* Catalase-positive
* Oxidase-variable
Other characteristics that tend to be associated with &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species (with some exceptions) include secretion of pyoverdine, a fluorescent yellow-green siderophore under iron-limiting conditions. Certain &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species may also produce additional types of siderophore, such as pyocyanin by &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and thioquinolobactin by &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot;. &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species also typically give a positive result to the oxidase test, the absence of gas formation from glucose, glucose is oxidised in oxidation/fermentation test using Hugh and Leifson O/F test, beta hemolytic (on blood agar), indole negative, methyl red negative, Voges–Proskauer test negative, and citrate positive.

&quot;Pseudomonas&quot; may be the most common nucleator of ice crystals in clouds, thereby being of utmost importance to the formation of snow and rain around the world.

The genus &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; is recognized for its remarkable metabolic diversity, enabling it to thrive in a wide range of environments. These bacteria produce a vast array of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, siderophores, and biosurfactants, which contribute to their ecological versatility and biotechnological potential.

===Biofilm formation===
All species and strains of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; have historically been classified as strict aerobes. Exceptions to this classification have recently been discovered in &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; biofilms. A significant number of cells can produce exopolysaccharides associated with biofilm formation. Secretion of exopolysaccharides such as alginate makes it difficult for pseudomonads to be phagocytosed by mammalian white blood cells. Exopolysaccharide production also contributes to surface-colonising biofilms that are difficult to remove from food preparation surfaces. Growth of pseudomonads on spoiling foods can generate a &quot;fruity&quot; odor.

===Antibiotic resistance===
Most &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; spp. are naturally resistant to penicillin and the majority of related beta-lactam antibiotics, but a number are sensitive to piperacillin, imipenem, ticarcillin, or ciprofloxacin. Aminoglycosides such as tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin are other choices for therapy.

This ability to thrive in harsh conditions is a result of their hardy cell walls that contain proteins known as porins. Their resistance to most antibiotics is attributed to efflux pumps, which pump out some antibiotics before they are able to act.

&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; is increasingly recognized as an emerging opportunistic pathogen of clinical relevance. One of its most worrying characteristics is its low antibiotic susceptibility. This low susceptibility is attributable to a concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., &quot;mexAB-oprM&quot;, &quot;mexXY&quot;, etc.) and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes. Besides intrinsic resistance, &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; easily develops acquired resistance either by mutation in chromosomally encoded genes or by the horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants. Development of multidrug resistance by &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; isolates requires several different genetic events that include acquisition of different mutations and/or horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Hypermutation favours the selection of mutation-driven antibiotic resistance in &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; strains producing chronic infections, whereas the clustering of several different antibiotic resistance genes in integrons favours the concerted acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants. Some recent studies have shown phenotypic resistance associated to biofilm formation or to the emergence of small-colony-variants, which may be important in the response of &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; populations to antibiotic treatment.

===Sensitivity to gallium===
Although gallium has no natural function in biology, gallium ions interact with cellular processes in a manner similar to iron(III). When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.

==Pathogenicity==

===Animal pathogens===

Infectious species include &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;P. oryzihabitans&quot;, and &quot;P. plecoglossicida&quot;. &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; flourishes in hospital environments, and is a particular problem in this environment, since it is the second-most common infection in hospitalized patients (nosocomial infections). This pathogenesis may in part be due to the proteins secreted by &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot;. The bacterium possesses a wide range of secretion systems, which export numerous proteins relevant to the pathogenesis of clinical strains. Intriguingly, several genes involved in the pathogenesis of &quot;P. aeruginosa,&quot; such as &quot;CntL, CntM, PlcB, Acp1, MucE, SrfA, Tse1, Tsi2, Tse3,&quot; and &quot;EsrC&quot; are core group-specific, meaning that they are shared by the vast majority of &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; strains, but they are not present in other &quot;Pseudomonads&quot;.

===Plant pathogens===

&quot;P. syringae&quot; is a prolific plant pathogen. It exists as over 50 different pathovars, many of which demonstrate a high degree of host-plant specificity. Numerous other &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species can act as plant pathogens, notably all of the other members of the &quot;P. syringae&quot; subgroup, but &quot;P. syringae&quot; is the most widespread and best-studied.

===Fungus pathogens===

&quot;P. tolaasii&quot; can be a major agricultural problem, as it can cause bacterial blotch of cultivated mushrooms. Similarly, &quot;P. agarici&quot; can cause drippy gill in cultivated mushrooms.

== Use as biocontrol agents ==
Since the mid-1980s, certain members of the genus &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; have been applied to cereal seeds or applied directly to soils as a way of preventing the growth or establishment of crop pathogens. This practice is generically referred to as biocontrol. The biocontrol properties of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; and &quot;P. protegens&quot; strains (CHA0 or Pf-5 for example) are currently best-understood, although it is not clear exactly how the plant growth-promoting properties of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; are achieved. Theories include: the bacteria might induce systemic resistance in the host plant, so it can better resist attack by a true pathogen; the bacteria might outcompete other (pathogenic) soil microbes, e.g. by siderophores giving a competitive advantage at scavenging for iron; the bacteria might produce compounds antagonistic to other soil microbes, such as phenazine-type antibiotics or hydrogen cyanide. Experimental evidence supports all of these theories.

Other notable &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species with biocontrol properties include &quot;P. chlororaphis&quot;, which produces a phenazine-type antibiotic active agent against certain fungal plant pathogens, and the closely related species &quot;P. aurantiaca&quot;, which produces di-2,4-diacetylfluoroglucylmethane, a compound antibiotically active against Gram-positive organisms.

==Use as bioremediation agents==
Some members of the genus are able to metabolise chemical pollutants in the environment, and as a result, can be used for bioremediation. Notable species demonstrated as suitable for use as bioremediation agents include:

* &quot;P. alcaligenes&quot;, which can degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
* &quot;P. mendocina&quot;, which is able to degrade toluene.
* &quot;P. pseudoalcaligenes&quot;, which is able to use cyanide as a nitrogen source.
* &quot;P. resinovorans&quot;, which can degrade carbazole.
*&quot;P. aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;P. putida&quot;, &quot;P. desmolyticum&quot;, and &quot;P. nitroreducens&quot; can degrade chlorpyrifos. 
* &quot;P. veronii&quot;, which has been shown to degrade a variety of simple aromatic organic compounds.
* &quot;P. putida&quot;, which has the ability to degrade organic solvents such as toluene. At least one strain of this bacterium is able to convert morphine in aqueous solution into the stronger and somewhat expensive to manufacture drug hydromorphone (Dilaudid).
* Strain KC of &quot;P. stutzeri&quot;, which is able to degrade carbon tetrachloride.

== Risks associated with pseudomonas ==
Pseudomonas is a genus of bacteria known to be associated with several diseases affecting humans, plants, and animals.

=== Humans &amp; Animals ===
One of the most concerning strains of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; is &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, which is responsible for a considerable number of hospital-acquired infections. Numerous hospitals and medical facilities face persistent challenges in dealing with &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; infections. The symptoms of these infections are caused by proteins secreted by the bacteria and may include pneumonia, blood poisoning, and urinary tract infections. &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; is highly contagious and has displayed resistance to antibiotic treatments, making it difficult to manage effectively. Some strains of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; are known to target white blood cells in various mammal species, posing risks to humans, cattle, sheep, and dogs alike.

=== Fish ===
While &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginos&quot;a seems to be a pathogen that primarily affects humans, another strain known as &quot;Pseudomonas plecoglossicida&quot; poses risks to fish. This strain can cause gastric swelling and haemorrhaging in fish populations.

=== Plants &amp; Fungi ===
Various strains of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; are recognized as pathogens in the plant kingdom. Notably, the &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot; family is linked to diseases affecting a wide range of agricultural plants, with different strains showing adaptations to specific host species. In particular, the virulent strain &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; tolaasii is responsible for causing blight and degradation in edible mushroom species.

==Detection of food spoilage agents in milk==

One way of identifying and categorizing multiple bacterial organisms in a sample is to use ribotyping. In ribotyping, differing lengths of chromosomal DNA are isolated from samples containing bacterial species, and digested into fragments. Similar types of fragments from differing organisms are visualized and their lengths compared to each other by Southern blotting or by the much faster method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fragments can then be matched with sequences found on bacterial species. Ribotyping is shown to be a method to isolate bacteria capable of spoilage. Around 51% of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; bacteria found in dairy processing plants are &quot;P. fluorescens&quot;, with 69% of these isolates possessing proteases, lipases, and lecithinases which contribute to degradation of milk components and subsequent spoilage. Other &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species can possess any one of the proteases, lipases, or lecithinases, or none at all. Similar enzymatic activity is performed by &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; of the same ribotype, with each ribotype showing various degrees of milk spoilage and effects on flavour. The number of bacteria affects the intensity of spoilage, with non-enzymatic &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species contributing to spoilage in high number.

Food spoilage is detrimental to the food industry due to production of volatile compounds from organisms metabolizing the various nutrients found in the food product. Contamination results in health hazards from toxic compound production as well as unpleasant odours and flavours. Electronic nose technology allows fast and continuous measurement of microbial food spoilage by sensing odours produced by these volatile compounds. Electronic nose technology can thus be applied to detect traces of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; milk spoilage and isolate the responsible &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species. The gas sensor consists of a nose portion made of 14 modifiable polymer sensors that can detect specific milk degradation products produced by microorganisms. Sensor data is produced by changes in electric resistance of the 14 polymers when in contact with its target compound, while four sensor parameters can be adjusted to further specify the response. The responses can then be pre-processed by a neural network which can then differentiate between milk spoilage microorganisms such as &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; and &quot;P. aureofaciens&quot;.

==Species previously classified in the genus==
Recently, 16S rRNA sequence analysis redefined the taxonomy of many bacterial species previously classified as being in the genus &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;. Species removed from &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; are listed below; clicking on a species will show its new classification. The term &#x27;pseudomonad&#x27; does not apply strictly to just the genus &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, and can be used to also include previous members such as the genera &quot;Burkholderia&quot; and &quot;Ralstonia&quot;.

δ proteobacteria: &quot;P. formicans&quot;.

==Phylogenetics==
The following relationships between genomic affinity groups have been determined by phylogenetic analysis:
==Bacteriophages==
There are a number of bacteriophages that infect &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, e.g.

* &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; phage Φ6
* &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; phage ΦCTX
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; phage EL
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; phage ΦKMV (a Phikmvvirus)
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; phage LKD16 (a Phikmvvirus)
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; phage LKA1 (a Phikmvvirus)
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; phage LUZ19 (a Phikmvvirus)

<text>Count Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov-Rymniksky, Prince of Italy () was a Russian general and military theorist in the service of the Russian Empire. 

Born in Moscow, he studied military history as a young boy and joined the Imperial Russian Army at the age of 17. Promoted to colonel in 1762 for his successes during the Seven Years&#x27; War, his victories during the War of the Bar Confederation included the capture of Kraków and victories at Orzechowo, Lanckorona, and Stołowicze. His reputation rose further when, in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, he captured Turtukaya twice and won a decisive victory at Kozludzha. After a period of little progress, he was promoted to general and led Russian forces in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792, participating in the siege of Ochakov, as well as victories at Kinburn and Focșani. 

Suvorov won a decisive victory at the Battle of Rymnik, and afterwards defeated the Ottomans in the storming of Izmail. His victories at Focșani and Rymnik established him as the most brilliant general in Russia, if not in all of Europe. In 1794, he put down the Polish uprising, defeating them at the battle of Praga and elsewhere. After Catherine the Great died in 1796, her successor Paul I often quarrelled with Suvorov. After a period of ill-favour, Suvorov was recalled to a field marshal position at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He was given command of the Austro-Russian army, and after a series of victories, such as the battle of the Trebbia, he captured Milan and Turin, and nearly erased all of Napoleon&#x27;s Italian conquests of 1796–97. After an Austro-Russian army was defeated in Switzerland, Suvorov, ordered to reinforce them, was cut off by André Masséna and later surrounded in the Swiss Alps. His successful extraction of the exhausted, ill-supplied, and heavily-outnumbered Russian army was rewarded by a promotion to &quot;Generalissimo&quot;. Masséna himself would later confess that he would exchange all of his victories for Suvorov&#x27;s passage of the Alps. Suvorov died in 1800 of illness in Saint Petersburg. He was instrumental in expanding the Russian Empire, as his success ensured Russia&#x27;s conquering of Kuban, Crimea, and New Russia.

One of the foremost generals in all of military history, and considered the greatest military commander in Russian history, Suvorov has been compared to Napoleon in military generalship. Undefeated, he has been described as the best general Republican France ever fought, and noted as &quot;one of those rare generals who were consistently successful despite suffering from considerable disadvantages.&quot; Suvorov was also admired by his soldiers throughout his whole military life, and was respected for his honest service and truthfulness.

== Early life ==

=== Origins ===

Alexander Suvorov was born into a noble family originating from Novgorod at the Moscow mansion in Arbat, given as dowry from his maternal grandfather, . His father, , was a general-in-chief and a senator in the Governing Senate, and was credited with translating Vauban&#x27;s works into Russian. His mother, Avdotya Fedoseyevna (née Manukova), was the daughter of judge Fedosey Manukov, and was an ethnic Russian. According to a family legend his paternal ancestor named Suvor had emigrated from Karelia, at the time ruled by the Swedish Empire, with his family in 1622 and enlisted at the Russian service to serve Tsar Michael Feodorovich (his descendants became Suvorovs). Suvorov himself narrated for the record the historical account of his family to his aide, colonel Anthing, telling particularly that his Swedish-born ancestor was of noble descent, having engaged under the Russian banner in the wars against the Tatars and Poles. These exploits were rewarded by Tsars with lands and peasants. This version, however, was questioned recently by prominent Russian linguists, professors Nikolay Baskakov and , who pointed out that the word &quot;Suvorov&quot; more likely comes from the ancient Russian male name &quot;Suvor&quot; based on the adjective , an equivalent of , which means &quot;severe&quot; in Russian. Baskakov also pointed to the fact that the Suvorovs&#x27; family coat of arms lacks any Swedish symbols, implying its Russian origins. Among the first of those who pointed to the Russian origin of the name were Empress Catherine II, who noted in a letter to Johann von Zimmerman in 1790: &quot;It is beyond doubt that the name of the Suvorovs has long been noble, is Russian from time immemorial and resides in Russia&quot;, and Count Semyon Vorontsov in 1811, a person familiar with the Suvorovs. Their views were supported by later historians: it was estimated that by 1699 there were at least 19 Russian landlord families of the same name in Russia, not counting their namesakes of lower status, and they all could not descend from a single foreigner who arrived only in 1622. Moreover, genealogy studies indicated a Russian landowner named Suvor mentioned under the year 1498, whereas documents of the 16th century mention Vasily and Savely Suvorovs, with the last of them being a proven ancestor of General Alexander Suvorov. The Swedish version of Suvorov&#x27;s genealogy had been debunked in the &quot;Genealogical collection of Russian noble families&quot; by V. Rummel and V. Golubtsov (1887) tracing Suvorov&#x27;s ancestors from the 17th-century Tver gentry. In 1756 Alexander Suvorov&#x27;s first cousin, Sergey Ivanovich Suvorov, in his statement of background (&quot;skazka&quot;) for his son said that he did not have any proof of nobility; he started his genealogy from his great-grandfather, Grigory Ivanovich Suvorov, who served as a &quot;dvorovy&quot; boyar scion at Kashin.

=== Childhood ===

As a boy, Suvorov was a sickly child and his father assumed he would work in civil service as an adult. However, he proved to be an excellent learner, avidly studying mathematics, literature, philosophy, and geography, learning to read French, German, Polish, and Italian, and with his father&#x27;s vast library devoted himself to intense study of military history, strategy, tactics, and several military authors including Plutarch, Quintus Curtius, Cornelius Nepos, Julius Caesar, and Charles XII. This also helped him develop a good understanding of engineering, siege warfare, artillery, and fortification. His father, however, insisted that he was unfit for military affairs. However, when Alexander was young, General Gannibal asked to speak to the child, and was so impressed with the boy that he persuaded the father to allow him to pursue the career of his choice.

== Early career ==
=== First military experience ===

Suvorov entered the military in 1745 and served in the Semyonovsky Lifeguard Regiment for nine years. During this period he continued his studies attending classes at Cadet Corps of Land Forces. He spent most of his time in the barracks: the troops loved him, though everyone considered him eccentric. Besides, he was sent with diplomatic dispatches to Dresden and Vienna; to carry out these assignments on 16 March 1752, he received a diplomatic courier passport, signed by the Chancellor Count Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin. From 1756 to 1758 Alexander next worked on the College of War; from 1758 he was engaged in forming reserve units, and was commandant of Memel. Suvorov gained his first battle experience fighting against the Prussians during the Seven Years&#x27; and the Third Silesian wars (1756–1763). His first skirmish occurred on 25 July 1759 under Crossen, when Suvorov with a cavalry squadron attacked and routed Prussian dragoons;—he was serving in General-Major Mikhail Volkonsky&#x27;s brigade. The following month Suvorov participated in the complete victory over Frederick the Great at the battle of Kunersdorf, after which the so-called Miracle of the House of Brandenburg happened.

At the time when Pyotr Semyonovich Saltykov, upon his Kunersdorf victory, remained unmoved and did not even send Cossacks to pursue the fleeing enemy, Suvorov said to William Fermor: &quot;if I were commander-in-chief, I would go to Berlin right now&quot;. Fortunately for Frederick, he faced not Suvorov.

=== 1761 ===
Then, Alexander served under the command of General-Major . Suvorov successfully defended his positions at Reichenbach, but contrary to his future rules did not pursue the retreating enemy, if the only surviving account of this action is accurate. At the skirmish of Schweidnitz, in a third assault, Suvorov managed to take the hill occupied by the hussar picket; in this clash 60 Cossacks opposed 100 hussars. For another example, in the combat of Landsberg on 15 September 1761, his Cossack-hussar cavalry unit defeated 3 squadrons of the Prussian hussars. On leaving the Friedberg Forest, he hit General Platen&#x27;s side units and took many prisoners. He also fought minor battles at Bunzelwitz, Birstein, Weisentine, Költsch, and seized the small fortified town of Golnau. After repeatedly distinguishing himself in battle Suvorov will become a colonel in 1762, aged around 33. Soon afterwards, following the capture of Golnau, he was given temporary command of the until the regimental commander recovered. Prussian observation detachments had spread far from Kolberg; Berg moved there in two columns, the left he led himself, and the right, which consisted of three Hussar, two Cossack, and Tver Dragoon regiments, he entrusted to Suvorov. In the village of Naugard the Prussians positioned themselves with 2 battalions of infantry and a weak dragoon regiment. Forming his unit in two lines, Suvorov began the attack. He felled the dragoons, struck one of the battalions, killed many on the spot and took at least a hundred prisoners. At Stargard, Suvorov attacked the rearguard of Platen, during which Suvorov cut into the enemy cavalry and infantry, during which it was reported that &quot;many were taken and beaten from the enemy&quot;. Suvorov managed to avoid heavy losses. All the battles described took place at the same time as the siege of Kolberg (1761) in Pomerania.

=== Freemasonry, Berlin ===

It is stated that Suvorov visited Prussian Masonic lodge. But it is doubtful that he himself was ever a Freemason. Just before his career in 1761, he took part in the raid on Berlin by Zakhar Chernyshev&#x27;s forces (one year after the Kunersdorf). Suvorov took in a young boy, took care of him during the whole campaign, and on arrival at the quarters sent to the widow, the boy&#x27;s mother, a letter reading:

&quot;Dear mother, your little son is safe with me. If you want to leave him with me, he will not lack anything and I will take care of him as if he were my own son. If you wish to keep him with you, you can take him from here or write me where to send him.&quot;

== Wars against Poland–Lithuania ==

=== Dissolution of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772) ===
==== Outbreak of war and setbacks ====

Suvorov next served in Poland during the Confederation of Bar. Leading a unit of the army of , he dispersed the Polish forces under Pułaski at Orzechowo, captured Kraków (1768), overthrew the Poles of Moszyński near Nawodzice in the spring of 1770, before defeating Moszyński&#x27;s Polish troops at Opatów in July. The following year Alexander Suvorov won a small combat with Charles Dumouriez&#x27;s army at Lanckorona, but he failed in the storming of the Lanckorona Castle, being injured here; and then on 20 May 1771, he unsuccessfully stormed the mountain near Tyniec Abbey, which included a strong redoubt enclosed by a palisade, trous de loup, and strengthened with two guns. The Russians under Suvorov and Lieutenant Colonel Shepelev captured the fortification twice, but were beaten back. Fearing to lose a lot of troops and time, Suvorov retreated. It were among the few tactical setbacks in his career, however, these were not field engagements.

Slightly earlier than at Tyniec, however, Suvorov had won small victories over the Confederates at Rachów and Kraśnik (27 &amp; 28 February 1771), capturing an entire wagon train in the first of these clashes. By a &quot;happy coincidence&quot;, Suvorov survived in it. After their failure at the Lanckorona Castle, the restored their reputation in Suvorov&#x27;s eyes, not only at Kraśnik but also in Rachów. He wrote to Weymarn:

The infantry acted with great subordination, and I made my peace with them.

==== Retaliatory strike ====

Follow-up clashes rectify Suvorov&#x27;s situation: the battle of Lanckorona one day after an incident at Tyniec, where Dumouriez, the future hero of the French Republic, was severely defeated; the combat of Zamość on 22 May 1771; the battle of Stołowicze; and the siege of the Wawel Castle (Kraków Castle), where the French and the &quot;szlachta&quot;, under the leadership of Brigadier Marquess Gabriel de Claude, made a sortie from the fortifications, and a force of Tyniec moved towards them – the Poles and their French allies were &quot;defeated by brutal shooting and put to flight&quot;, paving the way for the first partition of Poland between Austria, Prussia and Russia. Suvorov meanwhile reached the rank of major-general.


=== Battles against Polish uprising (1794) ===
==== Turning victories ====

More than two years after the signing of the treaty of Iași (Jassy) with the Ottoman Empire, Suvorov was yet again transferred to Poland where he assumed the command of one of the corps and led the victorious battles of Dywin, Kobryń, Krupczyce, and the battle of Brest where he vanquished the forces of the Polish commander ; afterwards, Suvorov won the battle at Kobyłka. The cavalry attacks at Brest and Kobyłka resemble of Suvorov&#x27;s offence at Lanckorona 22 years earlier, which ended in the defeat of Dumouriez. The battle showed that there was stability in his tactical rules, and he did not act on momentary impulse.

Suvorov was praised and exalted, anecdotes were told about him, his letters were quoted. It became known that he wrote a letter to Platon Zubov, in which, congratulating Zubov &quot;with local victories,&quot; he proceeded: &quot;I recommend to your favour my brothers and children, squires of the Great Catherine, who is so illustrious thanks to them&quot;. Suvorov sent to his daughter poems, where he described his working life:

The heavens have given us&lt;br&gt;Twenty-four hours.&lt;br&gt;I do not indulge my fate,&lt;br&gt;But sacrifice it to my Monarch,&lt;br&gt;And to end [die] suddenly,&lt;br&gt;I sleep and eat when at leisure.&lt;br&gt;Hello, and her household.

==== Triumph and tragedy in Praga ====

On 4 November 1794, Suvorov&#x27;s forces stormed Warsaw, held by Józef Zajączek&#x27;s troops, and captured Praga, one of its boroughs (a suburb or the so-called &quot;faubourg&quot;). The massacre of 12,000 civilians in Praga broke the spirits of the defenders and soon put an end to the Kościuszko Uprising. During the event, Russian forces looted and burned the entire borough. This carnage was committed by the troops in revenge for the slaughter of the Russian garrison in Warsaw during the Warsaw Uprising in April 1794, when up to 4,000 Russian soldiers died. According to some sources the massacre was the deed of Cossacks who were semi-independent and were not directly subordinate to Suvorov. Suvorov supposedly tried to stop the massacre and even went to the extent of ordering the destruction of the bridge to Warsaw over the Vistula River with the purpose of preventing the spread of violence to Warsaw from its suburb. Other historians dispute this, but most sources make no reference to Suvorov either deliberately encouraging or attempting to prevent the massacre. &quot;I have shed rivers of blood,&quot; the troubled Suvorov confessed, &quot;and this horrifies me&quot;. A total of 11,000 to 13,000 Poles were taken prisoner (approximately 450 officers), including captured with weapons, unarmed and wounded. Of the men taken alive and wounded, more than 6,000 were sent home; up to 4,000 were sent to Kiev, – from the regular army, without the scythemen, who were set at liberty with other non-military men.

Many writers call the storming of Praga a simple slaughterhouse. As historian Alexander Petrushevsky notes, Suvorov&#x27;s dispositions of the troops were characterised by remarkable thoroughness; such was that of Praga according to Petrushevsky. &quot;It is homogeneous with the Izmailian at its core and identical to it in many basic details. Both show a remarkable military calculation, which includes not only figures, but knowledge of the enemy&#x27;s character, properties and general strength, a correct estimation of their own resources, moral and material, and a choice of means based on these data. But even more than the plan (the storming programme), what is striking is its execution, in which some features of the plan turned out to be additional steps to the Russian victory. Only troops who are perfectly trained and between whom and their leader there is complete harmony can act in this way&quot;.

==== Culmination, impact of campaign ====

Despite early successes on a battlefield, the organizer of the uprising, Tadeusz Kościuszko, was captured by the Don Cossack general at the battle of Maciejowice, where Kościuszko was defeated at the hand of Baron Fersen&#x27;s larger forces. Suvorov&#x27;s and other Russians&#x27; victories led to the third partition of Poland. He sent a report to his sovereign consisting of only three words:

&quot;Hurrah, Warsaw&#x27;s ours!&quot; ()

Catherine replied in two words:

&quot;Hurrah, Field-Marshal!&quot; (that is, awarding him this rank)

The newly appointed field marshal remained in Poland until 1795, when he returned to Saint Petersburg. But his sovereign and friend Catherine died in 1796, and her son and successor Paul I dismissed the veteran in disgrace.

== Wars with the Ottoman Empire ==

=== 1st war against the Ottomans ===
==== Developments ====

The Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 saw his first successful campaigns against the Turks between 1773 and 1774, and particularly in the battle of Kozludža (1774); Suvorov laid the foundations of his reputation there. During the same conflict, the Imperial Russian Navy triumphed over the Ottoman Navy at the battle of Cheshme, and Peter (Pyotr) Rumyantsev, likewise one of the most capable Russian commanders of the era as per statistician Gaston Bodart and historian , routed the Ottomans at the battle of Kagul. Petrushevsky states the following: &quot;The battles of Larga, Chesma, and Kagul were balm for the Russian heart of Suvorov, but at the same time a vexation stirred up in him from the fact that he had not participated there. While in Poland, Suvorov&#x27;s displeasure, inflated by his self-love and unsatisfied thirst for activity, was fed by news from the Turkish theatre of war. There was (or he thought there was) what he wanted, that &quot;comfort&quot; about which he wrote to Yakov Bulgakov in January 1771. Especially strong was to ignite in Suvorov is the desire to go to the main army after its glorious deeds of 1770&quot;. It was then that he had already started pushing for a transfer from Poland to Turkey.

His later earned victories against the Ottomans bolstered the morale of his soldiers who were usually outnumbered, such as the stormings of Turtukaya from 21 May to 28 June 1773, and the repelling of the assault on Hirsovo fortress with a subsequent counterattack on 14 September that year. In Suvorov&#x27;s first reconnaissance to Turtukaya the troops pulled up to the tract of Oltenița, not far from the Danube, waiting for dawn. Suvorov stayed at the outposts, wrapped himself in a cloak and went to bed not far from the Danube shore. It was not yet daybreak when he heard loud shouts: &quot;alla, alla&quot;; jumping to his feet, he saw several Turkish horsemen, who with raised sabres were rushing towards him. He had barely time to jump on his horse and gallop away. Carabiniers were immediately sent to assist the attacked Cossacks, and those first-mentioned attacked the Turks in the flank, while they, having struck down the Cossacks, carried on to the heights. The Turks were repulsed, throwing themselves to the ships and hurriedly departed from the shore; there were only 900 of them, of whom 85 were killed, more were sunk; several men were taken prisoners, including the chief of the detachment. According to the testimony of the prisoners Suvorov managed to find out how many men were in the Turtukaya stronghold, and following its capture, even before sunrise, Suvorov wrote in pencil on a small piece of paper and sent to Lieutenant-General Count Ivan Saltykov, in whose division he served, the following short report: &quot;Your Excellency, we have won; thank God, thank you&quot;. Suvorov also sent another report to the Commander-in-Chief Rumyantsev, consisting of couplets:

Glory to God, glory to you,&lt;br&gt;Turtukaya is taken and I am there too.

The war ended with the treaty of Küçük Kaynarca.

Suvorov&#x27;s astuteness in war was uncanny and he also proved a self-willed subordinate who acted upon his own initiative. Rumyantsev&#x27;s putting Suvorov on trial for his arbitrary reconnaissance of Turtukaya belongs to the realm of pure fiction. Rumyantsev was not dissatisfied with Suvorov, but with Ivan Saltykov. There was inactivity in Wallachia after Suvorov&#x27;s initial capture of Turtukaya; Saltykov did not take advantage of the successful Turtukaya engagement despite the insistence of Rumyantsev; and Ottoman communications on the Danube became unimpeded. Lieutenant-General Mikhail Kamensky, with whose help Suvorov defeated the Turks at Kozludzha, not liking Suvorov, at the same time teased Ivan Saltykov with the mention of Alexander Vasilyevich. In one &quot;decent, but rather unpleasant&quot; letter to Saltykov, he amuses himself about the second Turtukaya victory of Suvorov and the inaction of Saltykov himself. Plus, a little earlier several reconnaissances had been made from Saltykov&#x27;s division and one of them very unsuccessful. Colonel Prince Repnin was taken prisoner with 3 staff officers, more than 200 Russians were killed and missing, 2 ships, and 2 cannons were recaptured.

=== 2nd war against the Ottomans ===
==== Beginning ====

From 1787 to 1791, under the overall command of Grigory Alexandrovich Potemkin, he again fought the Turks during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792 and won many victories; he was wounded twice at the hard-won Kinburn engagement (1787) and saved only thanks to the intervention of the grenadier Stepan Novikov. Novikov heard the call of his chief, threw himself at the Turks; he stabbed one, shot another and turned to the third, but that one fled, and with him the rest. The retreating Russian grenadiers noticed Suvorov, shouted: &quot;Brothers, the general stayed in front!&quot; and rushed again upon the Ottomans. The fight resumed, and the bewildered Turkish soldiers began again to rapidly lose one trench after another. Suvorov suffered greatly from grievous wounds and huge loss of blood; although he kept on his feet, he often fainted, and this went on for a month.

Suvorov was also soon involved in the costly siege of Ochakov (Özi). Energetic and courageous as usual, Alexander Suvorov proposed to take the fortress by storm, but Potemkin was cautious. &quot;That&#x27;s not how we beat the Poles and the Turks,&quot; Suvorov said in a close group of people; &quot;one look will not take the fortress. If you had listened to me, Ochakov would have been in our hands long ago&quot;. The siege that took place was supported by a blockade of the Black Sea flotilla of Charles Henri de Nassau-Siegen under John Paul Jones, a renowned fighter for American independence. After a fierce naval combat, the Russian rowing vessels surrounded the flagship and took it; only &quot;Kapudan-ı Derya&quot; Hasan Pasha managed to escape. However, when great damage was done to the Ottoman fortress plus fleet, &quot;as if inviting&quot; the besiegers to storm, Potemkin still continued the siege, which Rumyantsev wryly called the &quot;siege of Troy&quot;, and Suvorov described in couplet that he was: Sitting on a stone so cold,Watching Ochakov as of old. The mortality rate was extreme, from one cold 30–40 people a day: the soldiers were stiff in their dugouts, suffering terrible want of essentials, and so were the horses. During Potemkin&#x27;s visit to the camp, the soldiers took the courage to personally ask him to storm, but this did not work. At last there was a deafening murmur among the whole army. Only having reached such a hopeless situation Potemkin decided to storm, setting it for 17 December, in which Suvorov did not participate due to a bullet wound that penetrated his neck and stopped at the back of his head. This happened during a successful Ottoman sortie from the fortress.

==== The apex of military deeds ====

In 1789, after the joint Russian and Habsburg victorious battle of Focșani, he and the talented Austro-Bavarian general Josias of Coburg fought most decisive victories in their career. First at the battle of Rymnik, where, despite the vast inferiority in numbers (a Russian–Austrian force of 25,000 against 100,000 Turks), Suvorov persuaded the Austrian commander to attack; with the bold flanking maneuver of Suvorov and the resilience of the Austrians, together they routed the Ottoman army within a few hours, losing only 500 men in the process. Suvorov earned the nickname &quot;General Forward&quot; in the ranks of the Austrian corps for the latter victory; the word combination came to his attention and gave him sincere pleasure, as he later recalled this martial assessment of his person, smugly grinning. Suvorov&#x27;s 11th Fanagoriysky Grenadier Regiment was formed from soldiers who took part at Rymnik. Catherine the Great, in turn, made Suvorov a count with the name &quot;Rymniksky&quot; (or &quot;Rimniksky&quot;) as a victory title in addition to his own name, and the Emperor Joseph II made him a count of the Holy Roman Empire.

The second one came at the storming of Izmail in Bessarabia on 22 December 1790. On 20 December Suvorov convened a military council. Petrushevsky writes as follows: &quot;Suvorov had nothing to consult about, but by doing so, he acted on the basis of the law and used this means to communicate his decision to others, to make his view their view, his conviction – their conviction.&quot; Petrushevsky further observes: &quot;This is very difficult for ordinary commanders who do not tower over their subordinates in anything other than their position; but easy for such as Suvorov. There is no need for ranting, or intricately woven evidence; it is the winning authority that persuades, the unbending will that fascinates&quot;. Suvorov spoke a little in council and nevertheless brought everyone into raptures, he enthralled the very people who a few days ago considered the same assault unrealisable. The youngest of those present, Brigadier Platov, said the word &quot;assault&quot;, and the decision to assault was taken by all 13 persons without exception. The council determined:

&quot;approaching Izmail, according to the disposition to storm it without delay, in order to give the enemy no time for further strengthening, and therefore there is no need for reference to his lordship the commander-in-chief [Grigory Potemkin]. &quot;Serasker&quot;&#x27;s request is to be refused. The siege must not be turned into a blockade. Retreat is reprehensible to Her Imperial Majesty&#x27;s victorious troops. By virtue of chapter fourteen of .&quot;

Turkish forces inside the fortress had the orders to stand their ground to the end and haughtily declined the Russian &quot;ultimatum&quot;. Despite the fact that Mehmed Pasha was a resolute and firm commander, and inflicted serious losses on the Russians, his army was destroyed. Their defeat was seen as a major catastrophe in the Ottoman Empire, and in Russian military history there has never been a similar instantaneous storming of a fortress in terms of numbers and casualties as that of Izmail, much less without a proper siege. An unofficial Russian national anthem in the late 18th and early 19th centuries &quot;Grom pobedy, razdavaysya!&quot; (&quot;Let the Thunder of Victory Rumble!&quot;; by Gavrila Derzhavin and Józef Kozłowski) immortalized Suvorov&#x27;s victory and 24 December is today commemorated as a Day of Military Honour in Russia. In this war Fyodor Ushakov also won many famous naval victories, as in the battle of Tendra, which deprived the Ottomans of Izmail&#x27;s support from the Danube. Suvorov announced the capture of Ismail in 1791 to the Empress Catherine in a doggerel couplet.

The war ended with the treaty of Jassy.

== Cossack Rebellion (1774) ==

From 1774 to 1797, Suvorov stayed and served in Russia itself, that is, in Transvolga or &quot;Zavolzhye&quot;, in Astrakhan, Kremenchug, the Russian capital Saint Petersburg; in Crimea, or, more accurately, Little Tartary (Kuban which is in the North Caucasus, and Kherson); in the recently former Poland (Tulchin, Kobrin); and in the Vyborg Governorate, on the border with Swedish Finland.

=== In the footsteps of Pugachev ===
In 1774, Suvorov was dispatched to suppress Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion, whose leader Yemelyan Pugachev claimed to be the assassinated Tsar Peter III. Count Pyotr Panin, appointed for operations against Pugachev, asked to appoint a general to assist him, who could replace him in case of illness or death. On the very day of the news&#x27; arrival of Pugachev&#x27;s passage to the right bank of the Volga, Rumyantsev sent orders – to send Suvorov to Moscow as soon as possible. Suvorov, who was in Moldavia, immediately rushed out at full speed, met in Moscow with his wife and father. On the order left by Panin, in one caftan and without luggage, raced to the village of Ukholovo, between Shatsk and Pereyaslavl Ryazansky. He arrived in Ukholovo on September 3 (NS), just at the time when Panin received notice of Alexander Vasilyevich&#x27;s appointment. Panin gave him broad powers and ordered the military and civil authorities – to execute all Suvorov&#x27;s orders.

After receiving instructions, Suvorov the same day set out on the road, in the direction of Arzamas and Penza to Saratov, with a small escort of 50 men. Panin reported to the Empress on the rapid performance of his new subordinate, which &quot;promised in the circumstances of the time a lot of good ahead and therefore worthy of attention&quot;. Thanking him for such zeal and speed, the Empress granted him 2,000 chervonets to equip the crew. Reaching Saratov, Suvorov learned that tireless Ivan Mikhelson, who &quot;like a shadow&quot; followed everywhere after Pugachev and repeatedly defeated him, again defeated him badly. Strengthening his detachment here, Suvorov hurried to Tsaritsyn, but a lot of horses went to Pugachev, there was a lack of them, and Suvorov was forced to continue the journey by water. Defeated by Mikhelson, Pugachev slipped away; having somehow crossed the Volga with a small number of his loyalists, he disappeared into the vast steppe. Hasty arrival of Suvorov in Tsaritsyn drew the attention of the Empress, who announced her pleasure to Count Panin. But Suvorov was still essentially late. However, Suvorov did not stop it, he assigned to his detachment 2 squadrons, 2 Cossack sotnias, using horses captured by Mikhelson put on horseback 300 infantrymen, seized 2 light guns, and after spending less than a day on it all, crossed the Volga. Apparently, for reconnaissance on the rebels, he first moved upriver, came to a large village, which kept the Pugachev side, took 50 oxen, and then seeing that around the quiet, turned to the steppe. This vast steppe, which stretched for several hundred km., desolate, woodless, homeless, was a &quot;dead desert, where even without the enemy&#x27;s weapons was threatened with death&quot;. Suvorov had very little bread; he ordered to kill, salt and bake on fire some of the taken cattle and use the slices of meat for people instead of bread, as he did in the last campaign of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Thus secured for some time, Suvorov&#x27;s detachment went deeper into the steppe. &quot;They followed the sun by day and the stars by night; there were no roads, they followed the traces and moved as fast as they could, not paying attention to any atmospheric changes, because there was no place to hide from them&quot;. In different places Suvorov was overtaken and joined by several detachments, who went before him from Tsaritsyn; on 23 September, he came to the Maly Uzen River, divided his squad into four parts and went to the Bolshoy Uzen in different directions. Soon they stumbled on Pugachev&#x27;s trail; they found out that Pugachev was here in the morning, that his men, seeing an unstoppable pursuit, lost faith in the success of their cause, revolted, tied Pugachev and took him to Yaitsk, to extradite the leader to save themselves. And indeed Pugachev was arrested, as it turned out later, at this time, some from Suvorov. Suvorov arrived at the scene only in time to conduct the first interrogation of the rebel leader, but Suvorov missed the chance to defeat him in battle, who had been betrayed by his fellow Cossacks and was eventually beheaded in Moscow.

== Kuban and Crimea ==

=== Kuban ===

As a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, the Crimean Khanate became independent of the Ottomans, but in fact became a Russian protectorate (1774 to 1783). The Russian-imposed Şahin Giray proved unpopular. The Kuban Nogais remained hostile to the Russian government. From the end of January 1777, Suvorov set about building new fortifications at Kuban, despite the severe cold and predator raids, suggesting that the entire cordon should be shortened, and that it should be connected to the . There were only about 12,000 men under Suvorov&#x27;s command. He explored the region, more than 30 fortifications were built, and the order of service at the cordon was changed. Attacks from across the Kuban ceased; Tatars, guarded against the unrest of Turkish emissaries and from the raids of predators, were pacified, and began to make sure that the Russians really had good intentions towards them. But the peace was short-lived, however. &quot;Intelligent Rumyantsev could not fail to appreciate the fruitful activities of Suvorov in Kuban&quot; and spoke of him with pleasure and praise.

By 1781, the situation in the Crimean Khanate, especially in the North-West Caucasus, had &quot;heated up to the limit&quot;. Dissatisfaction with the Khan and the withdrawal of Russian troops led to an uprising of the Kuban Nogais at the beginning of the year. By July 1782, the uprising had spread to Crimea. In September to October 1782, Suvorov was engaged in &quot;restoring order&quot; on the territory of north-west Caucasus. The first insurrection was suppressed by the force of returning Russian troops directly by Alexander Suvorov and Anton de Balmen at the end of 1782 (Balmen put down a rebellion on the Crimean Peninsula territory). In 1783, Suvorov with complete surprise for the rebels crossed the Kuban River and in the battle of the Laba on 1 October (near Kermenchik tract) decisively quelled the second Nogai uprising, which, in turn, was triggered by Catherine&#x27;s manifesto, declaring Crimea, Taman, and Kuban as Russian possessions. At the Laba, Nogai losses amounted to 4,000.

=== Crimea (Little Tartary) ===

==== Christian resettlement ====
On behalf of Empress Catherine II, Suvorov participated in an incident – the forced resettlement of Christians from Crimea. The possession of Crimea did not seem secure for Russia at that time. Russia had to extract all it could from Crimea, and this was achieved by resettling Christians, mainly of Greek and Armenian nationalities, from Crimea: they had industry, horticulture and agriculture, which constituted a significant part of the Crimean Khan&#x27;s income. The fact that the Crimean Christians were burdened &quot;to the last degree&quot; by the Khan&#x27;s extortions and, therefore, the tax exemption granted to them in the new place should have inclined them in favor of the measure conceived by the Russian government, was in favor of the feasibility of resettlement. Thus the matter was resolved and Suvorov was entrusted with its execution. In the second half of September 1778 the resettlement ended. More than 31,000 souls were evicted; the Greeks were mostly settled between the rivers and Kalmius, along the river and all the way to Azov; the Armenians near Rostov and generally on the Don. Rumyantsev reported to the Empress that &quot;the withdrawal of the Christians can be regarded as a conquest of a noble province&quot;. 130,000 rubles were spent for transportation and food. Petrushevsky suggests that food itself cost very cheap, because Suvorov bought from the same Christians 50,000 quarters of bread, which, coming locally to the shops, cost half as much as delivered from Russia, what resulted in savings of 100,000 rubles. &quot;Suvorov&#x27;s orders were distinguished by remarkable and calculated prudence, he had put his heart into this business&quot;. More than half a year later, when the case was almost submitted to the archives, Suvorov still felt as if he had a moral obligation towards the settlers and wrote to Potemkin:

&quot;The Crimean settlers suffer many shortcomings in their present state; look upon them with a merciful eye, who have sacrificed so much to the throne; relish their bitter remembrance.&quot;

After Suvorov organized the resettlement of Armenian migrants displaced from Crimea, Catherine gave them permission to establish a new city, named Nor Nakhichevan by the Armenians. In addition, Alexander Suvorov would later found the city of Tiraspol (1792), now the capital of Transnistria.

In 1778 Alexander as well prevented a Turkish landing on the Crimean Peninsula, thwarting another Russo-Turkish war. In 1780 he became a lieutenant-general and in 1783 – General of the Infantry, upon completion of his tour of duty in the Caucasus and Crimea.

==== Kherson ====

Going to Kherson (1792), Suvorov received quite a detailed instruction. He was entrusted with command over the troops in the Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Taurida Oblast and the territory newly annexed from Ottoman Turkey, with the responsibility to manage the fortification works there. Black Sea Fleet was under the command of Vice-Admiral Nikolay Mordvinov, and a rowing fleet under the command of General-Major Osip Deribas, who was dependent on Suvorov only for troops in the fleet. Suvorov was ordered to inspect the troops to ascertain their condition and replenish what was missing, to survey the coast and borders, and submit his opinion on bringing them to safety from accidental attack; he was also allowed to change the disposition of the troops without giving any reason for neighbors to think that the Russians were anxious; – finally, he was ordered to collect and submit notifications from abroad.

Engineering occupied the most prominent place in Suvorov&#x27;s activities in the south, as well as in Finland. The plans signed by him were preserved: the project of the Phanagoria fortress, three projects of fortifications of the Kinburn Spit and the Dnieper–Bug estuary, the plan of the , the main logistics center of Tiraspol, the fort of Hacıdere (Ovidiopol) on the Dnieper–Bug estuary, Khadjibey (Odessa) and Sevastopol (Akhtiar) fortifications. Some of these were built during his time there and have progressed considerably, others had only just begun; there were also fortifications remained in the project due to short time and lack of money. At Sevastopol four forts were started, including 2 casemated; in Khadjibey was placed a military harbor with a merchant pier, according to François Sainte de Wollant&#x27;s plans, under the direct supervision of Deribas and supreme surveillance of Suvorov.

==== Tulchin ====

In Tulchin he contributed to the training of troops (1796). On arriving in Tulchin, Suvorov first of all paid attention to the welfare of the soldiers. There were &quot;huge numbers&quot; dying, as in epidemic times, especially at work in the port of Odessa, where the annual percentage of deaths reached up to 1/4 of the entire staff of the troops, and one separate team died out almost entirely. The reason: &quot;many generals were suppliers to the troops&quot;; the builder of Odessa Deribas capitalised &quot;terribly&quot; on this. Against all the &quot;evils&quot; detected, Suvorov took immediate measures, akin to those of the previous ones, and watched their execution vigilantly. Barely two months have passed before the death rate in Odessa fell fourfold, and in some other places the percentage of deaths was closer to normal, and in August it was below normal.

== Finland (1791–1792) ==

A feast was held in Russia to commemorate glorious military exploits, especially the storming of Izmail. A few days before the feast, 6 May 1791, Suvorov received from Potemkin command of the Empress – to go around Finland to the Swedish border, to design a border fortifications. Suvorov went willingly, &quot;just to get rid of his inactivity&quot;; the region was familiar to him, as 17 years ago he had already traveled around the Swedish border, and although the present task seemed more difficult, but with his usual energy and diligence, Suvorov completed it in less than 4 weeks. The Empress treated with full approval of Suvorov&#x27;s construction works.

During the harsh Finnish spring, he traveled in sledges in the wild backwoods of the Russian–Swedish border, enduring hardships that &quot;a military man of high position does not know even in wartime&quot;. Repeated the same old thing: Suvorov had already traveled in winter inclement weather, riding on a Cossack horse, without luggage, to Izmail.

Suvorov, besides building and repairing fortresses, had troops and a flotilla on his hands. The greater part of the rowing flotilla was in the skerries, the smaller on Lake Saimaa. At first the flotilla was commanded by Prince Nassau-Siegen, but in the summer of 1791, he absented himself from Catherine on the Rhine to offer his services to the French princes for the war against the Republicans. The flotilla was numbering upwards of 125 vessels of various names and sizes, with 850 guns; it was under the command of Counter-Admiral Marquess de Traversay and General-Major Hermann, subordinates to Suvorov. He was responsible for manning ships, for training people, for conducting naval exercises and maneuvers. Suvorov was never a nominal chief; he endeavoured to familiarise himself, as much as possible, with marine speciality. Some practical information he had acquired earlier, in the Dnieper–Bug estuary, where a flotilla was also under his command, and continued in Finland to look into naval affairs. On his first trip here he took private lessons, about which he wrote to Military Secretary ; later, according to some reports, he jokingly asked to test himself in naval knowledge and passed the exam &quot;quite satisfactorily&quot;.

Suvorov lived in different places in Finland, depending on the need: in Vyborg, , Ruotsinsalmi. In Kymmenegård he left a memory of his concern for the Orthodox Church: he sent a church choir director from St. Petersburg to train local choristers, bought different church things for several hundred rubles. Here he formed a circle of acquaintances, free from service time spent fun; Suvorov often danced, and in a letter to Dmitry Khvostov bragged that once he &quot;contradanced for three hours straight&quot;.

== Relations with Paul ==

Suvorov remained a close confidant of Catherine, but he had a negative relationship with her son and heir apparent Paul. Paul even had his own regiment of Russian soldiers whom he dressed up in Prussian-style uniforms and paraded around. Suvorov was strongly opposed to these uniforms and had fought hard for Catherine to get rid of similar uniforms that were used by Russians up until 1784.

When Catherine died of a stroke in 1796, Paul I was crowned Emperor and brought back these outdated uniforms. It is considered that in the same year of Russian nobility and of the Russian Empire came to an end, along with Catherine the Great. Suvorov was not happy with Paul&#x27;s reforms and disregarded his orders to train new soldiers in this Prussian manner, which he considered cruel and useless. Paul was infuriated and dismissed Suvorov, exiling him to his estate near Borovichi and kept under surveillance. His correspondence with his wife, who had remained at Moscow because their marriage was unhappy, was also tampered with. It is recorded that on Sundays he tolled the bell for church and sang among the rustics in the village choir. On weekdays he worked among them in a smock-frock.

== Italian and Swiss expedition of 1799 ==
=== Italian campaign ===
==== General coverage of events ====
In February 1799, Paul I, worried about the victories of France in Europe during the French Revolutionary Wars and at the insistence of the coalition leaders, was forced to reinstate Suvorov as field marshal. Alexander Suvorov was given command of the Austro-Russian army and sent to drive France&#x27;s forces out of Italy. For subordination of the Austrian soldiers to a general of foreign service, it was deemed necessary to place him a step above the most senior Austrian generals of the army of Italy, also granting the field-marshal of the HRE.

Suvorov and Napoleon never met in battle because Napoleon was campaigning in Egypt and Syria at the time. However, in 1799, Suvorov erased practically all of the gains Napoleon had made for France in northern Italy during 1796 and 1797, defeating some of the republic&#x27;s top generals: Moreau and Schérer at the Adda River (Lecco, Vaprio d&#x27;Adda, Cassano d&#x27;Adda, Verderio Superiore), again Moreau at San Giuliano (Spinetta Marengo), MacDonald near the rivers of Tidone, Trebbia, Nure at the Trebbia battle, and Joubert along with Moreau at Novi; but the Russians lost the battle of Bassignana. All the major battles (Adda, Trebbia, Novi) are of the most decisive nature. Besides, the following Italian fortresses fell before Suvorov: Brescia (21 April); Peschiera del Garda, Tortona, Pizzighettone (April); Alessandria, Mantua (July). Suvorov captured Milan and Turin, as well as citadels of these cities, and became a hero to those who opposed the French Revolution. Allied forces also took the towns of Parma and Modena, the capitals of the Duchies of Parma–Piacenza and Modena–Reggio respectively. The British drawn many caricatures dedicated to Suvorov&#x27;s expedition.

The French client states Cisalpine Republic and Piedmontese Republic collapsed in the face of Suvorov&#x27;s onset. Admiral Ushakov, sent to the Mediterranean for support to Suvorov, in 1799 completed the five-month siege of Corfu (1798–1799) and put an end to the French occupation of the Ionian Islands in Greece. On receiving news of the capture of Corfu, Suvorov exclaimed:

Our Great Peter is alive! What he, after defeating the Swedish fleet near Åland in 1714, said, namely that nature has produced only one Russia: she has no rival, — we see it now. Hooray! To the Russian fleet!.. I now say to myself: why wasn&#x27;t I at least a midshipman at Corfu?

==== Two resounding victories: Trebbia and Novi ====

The sister republic in the south, the Parthenopean, also fell before the British Royal Navy, Ushakov&#x27;s naval squadron, and the local rebels, since Jacques MacDonald at the head of the &quot;Army of Naples&quot; was forced to abandon southern Italy to meet Suvorov at the Trebbia, leaving only weak garrisons in the Neapolitan lands. MacDonald attacked Ott&#x27;s small force, whereupon Suvorov quickly concentrated most of his army against MacDonald and threw his men into the fray immediately after a hard march. This confrontation near the Trebbia proved to be the toughest French defeat of Suvorov&#x27;s Italian campaign: by the end of the retreat, MacDonald had barely 10,000 to 12,000 men left out of an army of 35,000. The battle of Novi, on the other hand, is the most difficult victory in Suvorov&#x27;s career, largely because the French had strong defensive positions and the Allies could not fully deploy their superior cavalry as a consequence; however, the Russo-Austrian victory turned into a complete rout for the French army. Its troops lost 16,000 of their comrades-in-arms (in total) and were driven from Italy, save for a handful in the Maritime Alps and around Genoa. But the &quot;Hofkriegsrat&quot; did not choose to take advantage, and sent Suvorov with his Austrian and Russian forces to Switzerland. Suvorov himself gained the title of &quot;Prince of the House of Savoy&quot; and the rank of grand marshal of the Piedmont troops from the King of Sardinia, and after the Trebbian battle – the title of &quot;Prince of Italy&quot; (or &quot;Knyaz Italiysky&quot;).

==== Detailed assessment of all battles ====

Like Gustavus Adolphus, Turenne, Frederick II the Great, Alexander the Great, Hannibal, and Caesar, in military affairs Alexander Vasilyevich was not vulnerable at any point, rushing with speed to the most important places, and carefully observed the principle of force concentration all his life: at San Giuliano Vecchio (1st Marengo), for example, his troops gathered more than double superiority, and at Novi not so considerable, but at least reaching about 38 per cent, which was still offset by the French army&#x27;s favourable position. The combat of Lecco, fought as a diversionary maneuver, brought virtually no advantage to either side, but at the beginning, before the reinforcements, the Russian troops were far inferior in numbers. At the combat of Vaprio (part of Cassano), passing through a river obstacle, the Coalition eventually managed to concentrate four thousand more troops in practice than the French did, largely also at the expense of the Cossacks; although in the middle of the battle the French had a twofold preponderance in numbers. In the end there were about 11,000 Austrians and Cossacks versus 7,000 French; but French troops began to give up their footholds before the remaining Austrian battalions arrived. Notwithstanding all, the outcome of the combat at Vaprio d&#x27;Adda could have been the only outcome: the timely arrival of 3,000 from Sérurier&#x27;s division, 6,000 from Victor&#x27;s division (2,000 he could have left at Cassano d&#x27;Adda on the way), would be 16,000 French, led by Moreau, against 11,000 of the enemy. At Cassano d&#x27;Adda, Suvorov allocated about 13,000 Austrians against approximately 3,000 French from the divisions of Paul Grenier and Claude-Victor (along with reinforcements), who had taken up strong defences behind the stream; but it was the combat of Vaprio that was decisive and pivotal. At Verderio the Sérurier detachment, cut off during the combat at Vaprio d&#x27;Adda, was surrounded and pinned down by the river. Thus, with roughly equal strength overall, having a minimum of 65,000 men at his disposal against the 58,000 available for active operations in the field as part of the French &quot;Army of Italy&quot;, Suvorov was able to use every advantage he had in the theater to win a complete victory at the battle of Cassano. The blame lies with Barthélemy Schérer: he scattered an even cordon along the whole river; on the more important stretch from Lecco to Cassano d&#x27;Adda, , there were no more than 12,000; meanwhile Suvorov had 42,000 on the same stretch.

Near the Trebbia, in contrast to the above, MacDonald had one and a half superiority; this circumstance is explained by the fact that Kray, despite the order of Suvorov, did not send him reinforcements, based on the direct command of Holy Roman Emperor Francis II not to separate any forces before the surrender of Mantua. It was too late for the commander-in-chief to find out. At the battle of the Trebbia on the first day at the Tidone River, the French had 19,000 men against his 14–15,000, and were thrown back. By the Trebbia River itself on the second day the forces were equal, and on the third day Suvorov, with some 22,000 men, beat MacDonald&#x27;s force of 33,000–35,000. Suvorov then rushed into a fighting pursuit, and at the Nure River, similar to Verderio, an entire Auvergne Regiment was captured after a short battle.

Despite the restraining influence of the &quot;Hofkriegsrat&quot;, Suvorov always held the initiative in his hands when dealing with the enemy. If the French sometimes tried to catch him (e.g., the movements of Moreau and MacDonald to join at Tortona), the Allies concentrated and dealt brutal blows like at the Trebbia. As for Novi, Joubert, advancing from Genoa to Tortona and expecting to catch the &quot;Allied Field Army&quot; scattered, unexpectedly met Suvorov and his &quot;strike fist&quot; behind Novi Ligure. But perseverance in the battle of Novi came to the point that when the Russian attacks were unsuccessful, Suvorov got off his horse and, rolling on the ground, shouted: &quot;dig a grave for me, I will not survive this day&quot;, and then resumed his attacks. Moreau spoke of Suvorov in this way:

&quot;What can you say of a general so resolute to a superhuman degree, and who would perish himself and let his army perish to the last man rather than retreat a single pace.&quot;

==== Campaign environment ====

As a disadvantage to his decisiveness, Field Marshal Suvorov, famous for the storming of Izmail, did not want to storm the citadels of Italian cities, and preferred to resort, in accordance with the situation, to blockade and siege. Nevertheless, during the Italian campaign of 1799 Suvorov&#x27;s talent expressed itself fully and comprehensively. Nikolay Orlov describes: &quot;When assessing Suvorov&#x27;s actions, one must always keep in mind the unfavourable situation for the commander, the environment in which he was:—meaning mainly the inconvenience of commanding the Allied troops, originating from the difference in political aspirations of the Allied governments, and the binding influence of the &quot;Hofkriegsrat&quot;&quot;.

The Polish forces had a no small quantity of militias, and the Turks and Tartars were largely &quot;unstable hordes&quot;. True, &quot;all these opponents were characterised by fanatical bravery, it was not easy for Suvorov to overcome them; the wars brought Suvorov practice, from which he took out extensive experience, his talent gradually developed and strengthened in this fight, the commander learned the essence, the spirit of war&quot;. In 1799, Suvorov&#x27;s enemies were troops purely regular, crowned with the glory of victories over the German armies (considered themselves the best in Europe), and were led by some of the best generals of the time, including Jean Victor Moreau, &quot;a man in the prime of life&quot; (35), who was generally respected in the army, distinguished by his theoretical knowledge of the art of war and combat experience, affability and high intelligence. &quot;He was not a high-minded genius, but the presence of mind and unwavering equanimity gave him the ability to come out with honour from the most critical circumstances. At any rate, after Bonaparte, he was the best French general of the time&quot; (the talented Lazare Hoche was no longer alive), winning the famous victory at Hohenlinden a year later. The theater of war was not like those steppes, swamps and forests, among which the commander had hitherto fought. In the war with the French Suvorov was not only commander-in-chief, independently acting in the theater of operations, but in addition he was in charge of the allied army – a matter even more difficult for a commander, and in the battles of Cassano and Novi the Austrians formed the bulk of the army, while at Cassano only irregular Cossack troops participated from the Russian side, including the encirclement of the French detachment at Verderio. It should also be noted that Suvorov, being fiery and irritable, was able to restrain himself in many cases.

=== Swiss campaign ===


==== Defeat of the allied armies ====

After the victorious Italian theater, Suvorov planned to march on Paris, but instead was ordered to Switzerland to join up with the Russian forces already there and drive the French out. The Russian army under General Korsakov was defeated by André Masséna at Zürich, and Friedrich von Hotze&#x27;s Austrian army was defeated by Jean-de-Dieu Soult at the Linth River before Suvorov could reach and unite with them all. &quot;…I have defeated myself Jelačić and Lincken who are now pinned down in Glarus. Marshal Suvorov is surrounded on all sides. He will be the one forced to surrender!&quot;—said Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor to Franz von Auffenberg and Pyotr Ivanovich Bagration.

Surrounded by Masséna&#x27;s 77,000 French troops, Suvorov with a force of 18,000 Russian regulars and 5,000 Cossacks, exhausted and short of provisions, led a strategic withdrawal from the Alps while fighting off the French.

==== Early achievements ====

Early on in the path, going to join with the not yet defeated Korsakov, he struggled against general Claude Lecourbe and overcame the St. Gotthard and Oberalp (that goes round Oberalpsee) mountain passes. Suvorov&#x27;s troops beat the French out of Hospental (situated in the Urseren valley), followed by the so-called &quot;Teufelsbrücke&quot;, or &quot;Devil&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, located in the Schoellenen Gorge, and the Urnerloch rock tunnel. All these interventions were not without great losses for Suvorov; but in his main attack, where he concentrated some 6,700 against 6,000 Frenchmen, he suffered relatively the same casualties as his opponent. However, Suvorov&#x27;s troops were at their wits&#x27; end.

Russian troops of Andrey Grigoryevich Rosenberg crossed the Lukmanier Pass, Austrian troops of Franz Auffenberg overcame the Chrüzli Pass, while Suvorov himself also later traversed more remote passes such as Chinzig and Pragel (Bragell), before climbing the 8,000-foot mountain Rossstock. Marching over rocks had worn out the soldiers&#x27; inadequate footwear, of which many were now even deprived, uniforms were often in tatters, rifles and bayonets were rusting from the constant dampness, and the men were starving for lack of adequate supplies,—they were exhausted, surrounded by impassable mountains in freezing cold, and, one way or another, faced a French army far superior in numbers and equipment. Cossack reconnaissance units instead of the Austrians of Lincken found the French there. France&#x27;s forces, meanwhile, blocked off many important places for troop movements; and on September 29 (18 OS), still uncertain but informed about the fate of Korsakov and Hotze (from the testimony of French prisoners), Suvorov assembled a council of war in the refectory of the Franciscan monastery of Saint Joseph, which decided to pave the way for the army toward Glarus. During the council the Russian commander showed himself extremely resolute not to surrender, blamed the Austrian allies for all the hardships they were forced to suffer, and proposed what appeared to him to be the only possible solution. Suvorov dictated the disposition: in the vanguard appointed to go Auffenberg, who came out on the 29th, and the next day the rest of the troops, except for Rosenberg&#x27;s corps and division, which remained in the rearguard and must hold the enemy coming out of Schwyz until all the packs had passed over the mountain Bragell. Rosenberg was ordered to hold firm,—to repel the French with all his strength, but not to pursue him beyond Schwyz. Alexander Suvorov&#x27;s speech was written down from the words of Pyotr Ivanovich Bagration, made a huge impression on everyone who attended (especially angry and menacing looked Derfelden and Bagration):

We are surrounded by mountains… surrounded by a strong enemy, proud of victory… Since the Pruth expedition, under the Sovereign Emperor Peter the Great, Russian troops have never been in such a perilous position… To go back is dishonorable. I have never retreated. Advancing to Schwyz is impossible: Masséna commands more than 60,000 men and our troops do not reach 20,000. We are short of supplies, ammunition and artillery… We cannot expect help from anyone. We are on the edge of the precipice! All we have left is to rely on Almighty God and the courage and spirit of sacrifice of my troops! We are Russians! God is with us!

==== Salvation and breakthrough ====


Between 30 September and 1 October 1799, Suvorov&#x27;s vanguard of 2,100 men, led by Bagration, was able to break through the Klöntal valley,—with Klöntalersee inside,—and reached the goal. It inflicted 1,000 killed or wounded, and another 1,000 captured to a French force of 6,500 men. However, Bagration tried to push further than Glarus, failing to do so: he was finally stopped by Molitor&#x27;s troops.

When Molitor took up a position at Netstal, he held for a long time, in spite of Bagration&#x27;s persistent attacks. Finally driven out of Netstal with the loss of a cannon, a banner and 300 prisoners, Molitor retreated to Näfels, on both banks of the river Linth. Here the French took a strong position, where they again repulsed Bagration long and hard. No matter how weakened Bagration&#x27;s troops were by the previous battles and heavy march through the mountains, they had so far gained superior numbers over Molitor&#x27;s detachment. Molitor had gone into full retreat, but the long-expected advance troops of Gazan soon came to his aid. The French now received an overwhelming strength and knocked them out of Näfels. Bagration in turn attacked Näfels and drove off the French, who then went on the attack again. Five or six times the village passed from hand to hand, and when last time it was occupied by the Russians, Bagration received orders from Suvorov to withdraw to Netstal, where at that time the rest of Derfelden&#x27;s troops were already concentrated. It was evening when Bagration came out of Näfels; noticing this, Gazan moved all his forces to the attack and himself led the grenadiers to the bayonets; but this time the French were also repulsed, and Bagration&#x27;s troops retreated quite calmly to Netstal.

Meanwhile, on the same days, the rearguard of 7,000 men out of a total of 14,000, commanded by Andrey Rosenberg, who, according to plan, was assigned the task of deterrence, met with Masséna&#x27;s forces, which numbered up to 15,000 men out of 24,000 in the Muotatal (Muota valley), formerly Muttental. Suvorov ordered to hold on there at all costs, and the rearguard, suffering 500 to 700 casualties, routed the French by inflicting them between 2,700 and 4,000 losses in two days. More than 1,000 prisoners alone were taken, including a general and 15 officers. Suvorov reported to Paul 6,500 French dead, wounded and prisoners of war in two days of fighting: 1,600 – September 30 and 4,500 – October 1. While Suvorov was fighting the French, the short-lived Roman sister republic had also fallen before the troops of the restored Kingdom of Naples.

Despite all the Russian successes on the battlefield, they were not going to win the campaign. Suvorov hoped to make the way for his exhausted, ill-supplied troops over the Swiss passes to the Upper (Alpine) Rhine and arrive at Vorarlberg, where the army, much shattered after a lot of crossing and fighting, almost destitute of horses and artillery, went into winter quarters. When Suvorov battled his way through the snow-capped Alps his army was checked but never defeated. Suvorov refused to call it a retreat and commenced a trek through the deep snows of the Panixer (Ringenkopf) Pass and into the 9,000-foot mountains of the Bündner Oberland, by then deep in snow. Thousands of Russians slipped from the cliffs or succumbed to cold and hunger, eventually escaping encirclement and reached Chur on the Rhine, with the bulk of his army intact at 16,000 men. After the troops reached Chur, they crossed another pass in the form of the St. Luzisteig, and hence left the territory of present-day Switzerland.

For this marvel of strategic retreat, earning him the nickname of the Russian Hannibal, Suvorov became the fourth &quot;Generalissimo&quot; of Russia on 8 November 1799 (28 OS). Historian Christopher Duffy, on the back cover of his book &quot;Eagles Over the Alps: Suvorov in Italy and Switzerland, 1799&quot;, called Suvorov&#x27;s whole Italian and Swiss adventure a kind of Russian &quot;crusade&quot; against the forces of revolution.

==== Consequences ====

Recently, beginning with his involuntary stay in the village of Konchanskoye, Suvorov often felt unwell; when he returned to duty, he seemed to have recovered, but by the end of the Italian campaign again began to grow weak. Before the Swiss campaign, his weakness was so great that he could hardly walk, his eyes began to hurt more often than before; making itself felt the old wounds, especially on his leg, so that not always could put on a boot. The Swiss campaign made him sicker; he began to complain of cold, which had never happened before; the cough, which had become attached to him some months before, did not leave him either, and the wind became particularly sensitive. He was officially promised a military triumph in Russia, but Emperor Paul cancelled the ceremony and recalled the Russian armies from Europe, including the Batavian Republic after the unsuccessful Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland; and ultimately the French would regain all of their conquered possessions on the Italian Peninsula.

== On the road from Switzerland to Russia ==

The return journey of Suvorov to Russia lasted more than three months.

Suvorov&#x27;s name, which had grown during the Italian campaign, took on a double luster after the Swiss campaign, and when he retired from the theatre of war and entered Holy Roman Empire (Germany), he became the centre of attention. Travellers, diplomats and soldiers flocked to his destinations, especially on his longer stops in Lindau, Augsburg and Prague. &quot;A general reverence bordering on awe&quot;, ladies sought out the honour of kissing his hand, and he did not particularly resist this. Everywhere he was welcomed and seen off, though he avoided it; every social gathering was eager to have him as its guest.

Russian society was proud of its hero and worshipped him enthusiastically. The Emperor Paul was a &quot;true&quot; representative of the national mood; he accompanied all his rescripts with expressions of the most gracious disposition to the &quot;Generalissimo&quot;, spoke of his unanimity with him, asked advice, and apologised for giving instructions himself. &quot;Forgive me, Prince Alexander Vasilievich,&quot; wrote the tsar, &quot;may the Lord God preserve you, and you preserve the Russian soldiers, of whom some were everywhere victorious because they were with you, and others were not victorious because they were not with you&quot;. In other rescript it has told:

&quot;…excuse me, that I have taken it upon myself to give you advice; but as I only give it for preservation of my subjects, which have rendered me so much merit under your leadership, I am sure, that you with pleasure will accept it, knowing your affection to me.&quot;

In the third:

&quot;I shall be pleased if you will come to me to advice and to love, after you have bring the Russian troops into our borders.&quot;

The fourth reads:

&quot;It is not for me, my hero, to reward you, you are above my measures, but for me to feel it and appreciate it in my heart, giving you your due.&quot;

The Tsar had extended his courtesy to the point that, in reply to Suvorov&#x27;s New Year greetings, he asked him to share them with his troops if he, the Tsar, was &quot;worthy of it&quot; and expressed his desire &quot;to be worthy of such an army&quot;.

=== Suvorov, Nelson, Coburg, and Charles ===

The famous Admiral Lord Nelson, who, according to the Russian ambassador in London, was at that time together with Suvorov the &quot;idol&quot; of the English nation, also sent the &quot;Generalissimo&quot; an enthusiastic letter. &quot;There is no man in Europe,&quot; he wrote, &quot;who loves you as I do; all marvel, like Nelson, at your great exploits, but he loves you for your contempt of wealth&quot;. Someone called Suvorov &quot;the land Nelson&quot;; Nelson was very flattered by this. Someone else said that there is a very great similarity in appearance between the Russian &quot;Generalissimo&quot; and the British Admiral. Rejoicing at this, Nelson added in a letter to Suvorov that although his, Nelson&#x27;s, deeds can not equal with those of Suvorov, but he asked Suvorov not to deprive him of the dear name of a loving brother and sincere friend. Suvorov answered Nelson in the same way, and expressed his pleasure that their portraits certify the similarity existing between the originals, but in particular was proud of the fact that the two were alike in their way of thinking.He also received a warm welcome from his old associate, the Prince of Coburg. The Grand Duke Constantine went to Coburg, through whom Suvorov conveyed a letter or bow to the Prince and via the same Grand Duke received a reply. The Prince called him the greatest hero of his time, thanked him for his memory, lamented the Russian army&#x27;s removal to the fatherland and lamented the bitter fate of Germany. Suvorov replied to the Prince and said among other things that the entire reason for the failure lies in the differences of systems, and if the systems do not come together, there is no point in starting a new campaign.

Furthermore, a little earlier he had correspondence with Archduke Charles, which, however, was of a sharp nature. Suvorov received greetings and congratulations even from strangers.

=== St. Petersburg ===

Early in 1800, Suvorov returned to Saint Petersburg. Paul, for some reason, refused to give him an audience, and, worn out and ill, the old veteran died a few days afterwards on 18 May 1800, at Saint Petersburg. The main reason for the newly emerged disfavor of Emperor Paul to Suvorov remains uncertain. Suvorov was meant to receive the funeral honors of a &quot;Generalissimo&quot;, but was buried as an ordinary field marshal due to Paul&#x27;s direct interference. Lord Whitworth, the British ambassador, and the poet Gavrila Derzhavin were the only persons of distinction present at the funeral. Suvorov lies buried in the Church of the Annunciation in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, the simple inscription on his grave stating, according to his own direction, &quot;Here lies Suvorov&quot;.

Often found in the literature references to the awarding of Suvorov with the Polish Orders of the White Eagle and Saint Stanislaus, the Prussian &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, the Neapolitan Order of Saint Januarius and the Bavarian &quot;Order of the Golden Lion&quot; (perhaps referring to the Order of the Palatine Lion) do not correspond to reality.

=== Progeny ===

27 (16 OS) January 1774, Suvorov was married to of the Prozorovsky and Golitsyn noble families, and had a son Arkadi Suvorov and daughter (in marriage Zubova), but his family life was not happy and he had an unpleasant relationship with his wife due to her infidelity. Suvorov&#x27;s son, Arkadi Suvorov (1783–1811) served as a general officer in the Russian army during the Napoleonic and Ottoman wars of the early 19th century, and drowned in the same river Rymnik in 1811 that had brought his father so much fame. The drowning of his son in the river is supported by Aleksey Yermolov&#x27;s memoirs, as well as by the military historian Christopher Duffy. His grandson Alexander Arkadievich (1804–1882) served as Governor General of Riga in 1848–61 and Saint Petersburg in 1861–66. Suvorov&#x27;s daughter Natalya Alexandrovna (1775–1844) known under her name &quot;Suvorochka&quot; married Count Nikolay Zubov.

== Character ==

Suvorov was one of the best-educated Russians of his time. He was well versed in mathematics, history and geography; spoke German, French, Italian, Polish, Turkish, Arabic and Finnish; he also had a thorough knowledge of philosophy, ancient and modern literature. His military erudition was impressive. He had studied all the important military works from Plutarch down to his own contemporaries, mastered the science of fortification and had also passed a naval qualifying examination.

Contrary to the belief that Suvorov was short, academic Vladimir Medinsky stated that Suvorov measured at 177 cm, taller than the average soldier.

==Political Views==
His political views were centered around enlightened monarchy. However, Suvorov had no interest in pursuing politics and made his disdain for the court lifestyle and tendencies of aristocrats well known: he lacked diplomacy in his dispatches, and his sarcasm triggered enmity among some courtiers. He joked with the men, calling common soldiers &quot;brother&quot; and shrewdly presented the results of detailed planning and careful strategy as the work of inspiration.

== Assessment ==
=== Suvorov&#x27;s art of war ===
Suvorov is widely considered to be the single greatest and most talented military commander in all of Russian history, the most gifted commander of the eighteenth century, and one of the greatest generals in world history. Suvorov has also been described as the best general Republican France ever fought, and the best Coalition general when he was active. Undefeated in battle, he led and won 63 battles without suffering a major defeat or setback.

Suvorov won despite being outnumbered in almost all of his battles, defeating many of the best commanders of the time period, those being André Masséna, Étienne Macdonald, and Jean Victor Marie Moreau of France, and Koca Yusuf Pasha, Cenaze Hasan Pasha, and Aydoslu Mehmed Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. Notably, Suvorov defeated the French Revolutionary Army multiple times, which was regarded as the best in the world, and Masséna, arguably the best French Revolutionary general, who had superior forces in terms of experience, morale, and numbers.

Moreau ultimately ranked Suvorov alongside Napoleon, while also describing Suvorov&#x27;s victory at Trebbia as &quot;the height of the art of war&quot;, while writer Eugen Binder von Krieglstein ranked Suvorov as one of the greatest commanders of all time, alongside Napoleon and Frederick the Great. Renowned military officer and theorist Antoine-Henri Jomini called Suvorov &quot;the true genius of war&quot;. Naval officer John Paul Jones, referred to as the &quot;Father of the American Navy&quot;, labeled Suvorov the &quot;greatest warrior&quot; and ranked him alongside Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus Adolphus and Frederick the Great. The British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore called Suvorov Russia&#x27;s most brilliant general and ranked him as one of the modern military geniuses, along with Napoleon and Frederick the Great.

In 1799, Napoleon himself warned the Directory that they would not be able to stop Suvorov unless they found generals with &quot;special skill in fighting him&quot;. In 1807, Macdonald declared to the Russian ambassador at a reception with Napoleon and a crowd around that &quot;This crew would never have seen the Tuileries if you had had a second Suvorov&quot;.

While on a campaign, he reportedly lived as a private soldier, sleeping on straw and contenting himself with the humblest fare. Suvorov saw victory as dependent on the morale, training, and initiative of the front-line soldier. In battle he emphasized speed and mobility, accuracy of gunfire and the use of the bayonet, as well as detailed planning and careful strategy. His motto: &quot;coup d&#x27;oeil&quot; (&quot;glazomer&quot;), speed (&quot;bystrota&quot;), impetus (&quot;natisk&quot;). He abandoned traditional drills, and communicated with his troops in clear and understandable ways. Suvorov also took great care of his army&#x27;s supplies and living conditions, reducing cases of illness among his soldiers dramatically, and earning their loyalty and affection. A master of logistics, Suvorov ordered his officers, quartermasters and doctors to keep the welfare and fitness of the troops in the forefront of their attentions. He severely punished, often with courts-martial, any officers who senselessly or cruelly drilled their troops or who failed to maintain his high sanitary and health standards. Although a strict disciplinarian, he took extenuating circumstances into account. Once a soldier or officer had been punished or reprimanded, Suvorov would do his utmost to rehabilitate him.

Suvorov &quot;did not know retreat&quot;, he constantly acted offensively and in accordance with the situation was looking for a fight, not evaded it, but he did not overuse the battles, the fight always turned out to be appropriate, necessary in the operation, and moreover decisive; if he got the chance to confront his enemy, he used it with all the energy. Suvorov&#x27;s guiding principle was to detect the weakest point of an enemy and focus an attack upon that area. He would send forth his units in small groups as they arrived on the battlefield to sustain momentum. Suvorov used aimed fire instead of repeated barrages from line infantry and applied light infantrymen as skirmishers and sharpshooters. He used a variety of army sizes and types of formations against different foes: squares against the Turks, lines against Poles, and columns against the French.

Suvorov believed that &quot;a military man must know the languages of the nations with whom he is fighting,&quot; so he developed a fluent command of French, German, Greek, Ottoman Turkish, Italian, Polish and Latin, as well as some knowledge of Arabic, Finnish and Persian. He also rejected a suggestion that the Russian army rid itself of its musicians, saying,

&quot;music doubles, trebles the force of an army.&quot;

According to D. S. Mirsky, Suvorov &quot;gave much attention to the form of his correspondence, and especially of his orders of the day. These latter are highly original, deliberately aiming at unexpected and striking effects. Their style is a succession of nervous staccato sentences, which produce the effect of blow and flashes. Suvorov&#x27;s official reports often assume a memorable and striking form. His writings are as different from the common run of classical prose as his tactics were from those of Frederick or Marlborough&quot;.

Mikhail Ivanovich Dragomirov declared that he based his teaching on Suvorov&#x27;s practice, which he held as representative of the fundamental truths of war and of the military qualities of the Russian nation.

Suvorov&#x27;s maneuvering of the Alps led him to be called the &quot;Russian Hannibal&quot;, and was also referred to as the &quot;Russian Mars&quot; and &quot;God of War&quot;. The French king, Louis XVIII, compared Suvorov to Attila.

=== Suvorov and Napoleon ===

Suvorov considered Hannibal, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and Napoleon Bonaparte to be the greatest military commanders of all time. Suvorov is seen as having anticipated Napoleon&#x27;s tactics, and is regarded as being on par with him in terms of military genius. Like Napoleon, Suvorov believed that opportunities in battle are created by fortune but exploited by intelligence, experience and an intuitive vision. To Suvorov, mastery of the art and science of war was not, therefore, purely instinctive. Suvorov kept up with events in Europe by subscribing to foreign newspapers and journals. He had written to one of his nephews in 1796:

&quot;That young Bonaparte, how he moves! He is a hero, a giant, a magician. He overcomes nature and he overcomes men. He turned the Alps as if they did not exist; he has hidden their frightful rocks in his pocket, and tucked up his army up the right sleeve of his uniform. The enemy scarcely catches sight his soldiers before he throws his troops at them like a thunderbolt from Jupiter, spreading terror in all directions, and crushing the scattered bands of Austrians and Piedmontese. My God, how he moves! The first time he assumed command he cut to the heart of tactics like a sword slashing through the Gordian Knot. He disregards the odds against him, he attacks the enemy wherever they are to be found, and he defeats them in detail. He knows that shock is irresistibe—and that says it all. His enemies will continue in their old routine, subject to the scribblers in the Cabinet, but as for him, he carries his council of war in his head. His operations are as free as the air he breathes… My conclusion is this. That as long as General Bonaparte keeps his wits about him he will be victorious; he possesses the higher elements of the military art in a happy balance. But if, unfortunately for him, he throws himself into the whirlpool of politics, he will lose the coference of his thoughts and he will be lost.&quot;

Suvorov held Napoleon in high regard, despite not living to see the Napoleonic Wars. However, Napoleon did not reciprocate Suvorov&#x27;s esteem, assessing Suvorov as having &quot;the soul of a great commander, but not the brains. He was extremely strong willed, he was amazingly active and utterly fearless—but he was as devoid of genius as he was ignorant of the art of war&quot;. Despite the two never facing each other, military historians often debate between Suvorov and Napoleon as to who was the superior commander.

== Legacy ==

Suvorov was buried in Saint Petersburg in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. His gravestone states simply: &quot;Here lies Suvorov&quot;.

Within a year after his death, Paul I was murdered in his bedroom for his disastrous leadership by a band of dismissed officers and his son and successor Alexander I erected a statue to Suvorov&#x27;s memory in the Field of Mars.

Suvorov&#x27;s revolutionary methods of waging war endure in his prodigious literary, documentary and epistolary output. He was famed for his military writings, the most well-known being &quot;The Science of Victory&quot; (&quot;The Science of Winning&quot;) and &quot;Suzdal Regulations&quot;, and lesser-known works such as &quot;Rules for the Kuban and Crimean Corps&quot;, &quot;Rules for the Conduct of Military Actions in the Mountains&quot; (written during his Swiss campaign), and &quot;Rules for the Medical Officers&quot;. Suvorov was also noted for several of his sayings:

&quot;What is difficult in training will become easy in a battle.&quot;

&quot;Perish yourself but rescue your comrade!&quot;

&quot;Fight the enemy with the weapons he lacks.&quot;

&quot;One minute can decide the outcome of the battle, one hour — the outcome of the campaign, and one day — the fate of the country.&quot;

&quot;He who is afraid is half beaten.&quot;

&quot;To me death is better than the defensive.&quot;

&quot;A strong pursuit, give no time for the enemy to think, take advantage of victory, uproot him, cut off his escape route.&quot;

&quot;When the enemy is driven back, we have failed, and when he is cut off, encircled and dispersed, we have succeeded.&quot;

He taught his soldiers to attack instantly and decisively:

&quot;Attack with the cold steel! Push hard with the bayonet!&quot;



A &quot;Suvorov school&quot; of generals who had apprenticed under him played a prominent role in the Russian military. Among them was future Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov who led the Russian imperial army against Napoleon during the Napoleonic Wars, including the French invasion of Russia. Suvorov, a follower of Peter I the Great and a pupil of Field Marshal Pyotr Alexandrovich Rumyantsev-Zadunaisky, brought up a pleiad of remarkable commanders and military leaders, among whom the most outstanding were, except for Kutuzov, Generals of the Infantry P. I. Bagration, M. A. Miloradovich. On his ideas were brought up Field Marshal D. A. Milyutin, Generals of the Infantry M. I. Dragomirov, M. D. Skobelev, General of the Cavalry A. A. Brusilov, and other famous military figures.

The Suvorov Museum opened in Saint Petersburg in 1900 to commemorate the centenary of the general&#x27;s death. Apart from in St. Petersburg, other Suvorov museums and monuments have feature in Focșani, Ochakiv(-ov) [1907], Sevastopol [1983], Tulchyn(-in) [1954], Kobryn(-in) [1949; 1950; 1964], Novaya Ladoga [1947], Kherson [1904], Tymanivka or Timanovka [1947; 1950], Simferopol [1984], Kaliningrad [1956], Konchanskoye-Suvorovskoye [1942], Râmnicu Sărat or Rymnik, Elm and Andermatt which are in the Swiss Alps, etc.

During World War II, the Soviet Union revived the memory of many pre-1917 Russian heroes to raise patriotism. Suvorov was the Tsarist military figure most often referred to by Joseph Stalin, who also received (but did not personally use) the rank of &quot;Generalissimo&quot; that Suvorov had previously held. The Order of Suvorov was established by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on 29 July 1942, and it is still awarded to senior army personnel for exceptional leadership in combat operations against superior enemy forces.

The town of Suvorovo in Varna Province, Bulgaria, was named after Suvorov during the communist period, as was the Russian ship which discovered Suwarrow Island in the Pacific in 1814.

Various currency notes of the Transnistrian ruble depict Suvorov.

There is a Suvorov Square in Tiraspol, Transnistria, named after Alexander Vasilyevich, and another in Saint Petersburg.

His prowess, military wisdom, and daring remain in high regard. Another of his many utterances are well known in the Russian military:

&quot;Achieve victory not by numbers, but by knowing how.&quot;

&quot;The bullet is a mad thing; only the bayonet knows what it is about.&quot;

&quot;Train hard, fight easy. Train easy and you will have hard fighting.&quot;

&quot;Train hard, fight easy&quot; became a Russian proverb.

Alexander Petrushevsky in third volume of his work &quot;Generalissimo Prince Suvorov&quot; quoted a small song of Russian soldiers about Alexander Suvorov, Pyotr Rumyantsev, and Grigory Potemkin:

Count Rumyantsev-general&lt;br&gt;Lost a lot of strength.&lt;br&gt;Thief Potemkin-general&lt;br&gt;Was never in his own regiment,&lt;br&gt;He neglected all his strength:&lt;br&gt;Some of it he drank, some of it he squandered,&lt;br&gt;Some of it he lost at cards.&lt;br&gt;And Suvorov-general&lt;br&gt;Proved his strength,&lt;br&gt;He loaded a small cannon,&lt;br&gt;He took the king prisoner.

In Russia, there are 12 secondary-level military schools called Suvorov Military School that were established during the USSR. There is also a military school in Minsk named after Suvorov.

In Soviet times, the 1941 film &quot;Suvorov&quot; was made (released in the US as &quot;General Suvorov&quot;).

Russia&#x27;s former defence minister Sergei Shoigu has proposed that Suvorov be made a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church.

=== Ukraine ===

Due to &quot;decommunization policies&quot; the street named after Suvorov in (Ukraine&#x27;s capital) Kyiv was renamed after Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko in 2016. Suvorov is not related to communism, but his name was used by the Soviet Union for propaganda purposes.

In September 2022, a street that was named after Suvorov in Dnipro (Ukraine) was renamed to honor Alan Shepard.

In October 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian troops captured a monument to Suvorov in Kherson and took it with them as they fled the city.

Poet Alexander Shishkov devoted an epitaph to Suvorov, while Gavrila Derzhavin mentioned him in &quot;Snigir&quot; (Bullfinch) and other poems, calling Suvorov &quot;an Alexander by military prowess, a stoic by valor&quot;. Suvorov was mentioned by Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov and in the numerous works of other Russian poets of the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Ivan Dmitriev, Apollon Maykov, Dmitry Khvostov, Yermil Kostrov, Kondraty Ryleyev, Vasili Popugaev. Kostrov, the first translator of Homer into Russian, wrote an ode in honor of Suvorov and an epistolary on the capture of Izmail. In 1795 poet and soldier , who had fought under the command of Alexander Suvorov, wrote a heroic poem titled &quot;Suvoriada&quot;, celebrating Suvorov&#x27;s victories. Suvorov is one of the characters in the drama &quot;Antonio Gamba, Companion of Suvorov in the Alpine Mountains&quot; by Sergey Glinka which commemorates the Swiss expedition of 1799. In British literature, Byron caricatured Suvorov in the seventh canto of &quot;Don Juan&quot;. In Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, old Prince Nicholas Bolkonski says: &quot;Suvorov couldn&#x27;t manage them so what chance has Michael Kutuzov?&quot;. Tolstoy also refers to Suvorov later on in the book. Suvorov is also mentioned by Capt. Ryków in Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s poem &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;.

<text>Rudolf Otto Sigismund Lipschitz (14 May 1832 – 7 October 1903) was a German mathematician who made contributions to mathematical analysis (where he gave his name to the Lipschitz continuity condition) and differential geometry, as well as number theory, algebras with involution and classical mechanics.

==Biography==
Rudolf Lipschitz was born on 14 May 1832 in Königsberg. He was the son of a landowner and was raised at his father&#x27;s estate at Bönkein which was near Königsberg. He entered the University of Königsberg when he was 15, but later moved to the University of Berlin where he studied with Gustav Dirichlet. Despite having his studies delayed by illness, in 1853 Lipschitz graduated with a PhD in Berlin.

After receiving his PhD, Lipschitz started teaching at local Gymnasiums. In 1857 he married Ida Pascha, the daughter of one of the landowners with an estate near to his father&#x27;s, and earned his habilitation at the University of Bonn, where he remained as a privatdozent. In 1862 Lipschitz became an extraordinary professor at the University of Breslau where he spent the following two years. In 1864 Lipschitz moved back to Bonn as a full professor. He was the first Jewish full professor at the University of Bonn. He was appointed Bonn&#x27;s first chair of Mathematics in 1869. He remained there for the rest of his career. Here he examined the dissertation of Felix Klein. Lipschitz died on 7 October 1903 in Bonn.

<text>The 1984 International Games for the Disabled, commonly known as the 1984 Summer Paralympics, were the seventh Paralympic Games to be held. There were two separate competitions: one in Stoke Mandeville, England, United Kingdom for wheelchair athletes with spinal cord injuries and the other at the Mitchel Athletic Complex and Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, United States for wheelchair and ambulatory athletes with cerebral palsy, amputees, and &quot;les autres&quot; [the others] (conditions as well as blind and visually impaired athletes). Stoke Mandeville had been the location of the Stoke Mandeville Games from 1948 onwards, seen as the precursors to the Paralympic Games, as the 9th International Stoke Mandeville Games in Rome in 1960 are now recognised as the first Summer Paralympics.

As with the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, the Soviet Union and other communist countries, except China, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia, boycotted the Paralympic Games. The Soviet Union did not participate in the Paralympics at the time, arguing that they have no disabled people (called &quot;invalids&quot; by Soviet officials) in the country. The USSR made its Paralympic debut in 1988, during Perestroika.

The 1984 Paralympic Games were the last Summer Games not to be staged by the same host city as the Olympic Games. Seoul hosted both events in 1988, a pattern maintained thereafter.

== Ceremonies ==
In the opening ceremonies, patchy showers greeted the 14,000 spectators packed into the Mitchel Park stadium for the 2pm start of the New York Games opening ceremony on 19 June. New York radio personality William B. Williams introduced everyone with a welcome speech. Entertainers such as Bill Buzzeo and the Dixie Ramblers, Richie Havens, The New Image Drum and Bugle Corps, the ARC Gospel Chorus and the Square Dance Extravaganza followed the introduction speech. At the closing ceremonies, Commander Archie Cameron, President of ICC officially closed the games with a short speech acknowledging the athletes and the next host city, Seoul, South Korea and was to be held in conjunction with the 1988 Summer Olympics. The flag of the Games was lowered and American athletes carried the flag back to the honor stand where they handed over to the President of the Organizing Committee, Dr William T. Callahan and Cameron.

== Mascot ==

The mascot for the 1984 Paralympic Games was Dan D. Lion, which was designed by an art teacher, Maryanne McGrath Higgins. The name was voted on by students of the Human Resources School (now Henry Viscardi School), a school in Albertson, New York for students with severe physical impairments. Another mascot named Dan D. Lion, with a different design, was the mascot for the British team in the Stoke Mandeville portion of the Games.

== Sports ==
Competitors were divided into five disability-specific categories: amputee, cerebral palsy, visually impaired, wheelchair, and &quot;les autres&quot; (athletes with physical disabilities that had not been eligible to compete in previous Games). The wheelchair category was for those competitors who used a wheelchair due to a spinal cord disability. However some athletes in the amputee and cerebral palsy categories also competed in wheelchairs. Within the sport of athletics, a wheelchair marathon event was held for the first time. The trials for the two wheelchair events to be held at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games was held in conjunction with the New York Games. However, despite the long and established history of using &quot;paralympic&quot; terminology, in the United States the US Olympic Committee prohibited the Games organizers from using the term. The seventeen contested sports are listed below, along with the disability categories which competed in each.

* Archery – Cerebral palsy, wheelchair, and les autres
* Athletics – All
* Boccia – Cerebral palsy
* Cycling – Cerebral palsy
* Equestrian – Cerebral palsy
* Football 7-a-side – Cerebral palsy
* Goalball – Visually impaired

* Lifting – Amputee, cerebral palsy, wheelchair, and les autres
** Powerlifting
** Weightlifting
* Shooting – Amputee, cerebral palsy, wheelchair, and les autres
* Snooker – Wheelchair
* Swimming – All
* Table tennis – Amputee, cerebral palsy, wheelchair, and les autres
* Volleyball – Amputee and les autres
* Wheelchair basketball – Wheelchair and les autres
* Wheelchair fencing – Wheelchair
* Wrestling – Visually impaired

== Medal table ==

==Reception at the host cities==
Odeda Rosenthal, a professor of humanities at a local community college on Long Island and translator for the Austrian team highlighted a number of problems at the games in a series of articles. She highlighted a number of issues such as poor communication, administrative hiccups and even bus drivers not knowing the routes to scheduled events that even caused some teams to miss events completely. Rosenthal continues by slamming the work by the Police Chief claiming the Chief &quot;took the opposite tack of anything that was suggested to sort out the mess&quot;. However, overall reports and the general impression exuded by the games included a friendly atmosphere and volunteers trying their hardest under difficult conditions.

<text>The 1992 Summer Paralympics (; ) were the ninth Paralympic Games to be held. They were held in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. In addition, the 1992 Paralympic Games for Persons with mental handicap were held immediately after the regular Paralympics in the Spanish capital, Madrid.

== Host city selection ==
Barcelona is the second-largest city in Spain and the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, and the hometown of then-IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and the famous European club, FC Barcelona that from the beginning of the candidacy provided support and financially helped the project. The city was also a host for the 1982 FIFA World Cup with two venues who were also used during the games. On 17 October 1986, Barcelona was selected to host the 1992 Summer Olympics over Amsterdam, Netherlands; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Birmingham, United Kingdom; Brisbane, Australia; and Paris, France, during the 91st IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland. With 85 out of 89 members of the IOC voting by secret ballot, Barcelona won a majority of 47 votes. Samaranch abstained from voting. In the same IOC meeting, Albertville, France, won the right to host the 1992 Winter Games. Paris and Brisbane would eventually be selected to host the 2024 and 2032 Summer Paralympics respectively.

Barcelona had previously bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics that were ultimately held in Berlin.

During the Olympic bid process, Barcelona demonstrated itself to be open and motivated to host the Paralympic Games and, unlike previous host cities, the bidding Committee managed to establish good relations with the then International Coordination Committee (ICC). Shortly after the selection of the Olympic host city in September 1986, negotiations with the ICC began under the mediation of Juan Antonio Samaranch.

In an innovative and risky way, Barcelona was presenting an adapted version of its Olympic project in which for the first time in history, the Olympic and Paralympic Games would be managed, planned and executed by the same people without any type of differentiation. Furthermore, unlike Seoul, Paralympic athletes would have the same conditions and opportunities as their Olympic counterparts. 
This involved the fact that the athletes would compete in the same venues that were already in planning with the maximum accessibility factors in force at the time, they would also have access to the same Olympic village and all the services and actions by the organizers.

===The inovative measures===
In April 1987, Barcelona accepted the difficult matter to host of the 1992 Summer Paralympics.This challenge was impacted by the fact that the organizers did not differentiate between the two events and organized them in a unique way, providing the same conditions for Olympic and Paralympic athletes. And this decision also encompassed a unified visual identity,the same marketing program and actions, the use of the same competition venues with some small differences and accommodation in the same village with the use of the same services and facilities,giving to them the same opportunites.This same conditions led to innovative forms of equality and equalization and which involved for the first time the implementation of an educational program at the Paralympics and which was managed in the same way as the Olympics resuting in a bigger population engagement programs. While COOB&#x27;92 was linked to the IOC for ticket sales, the ICC was not interested in this and the public can follow the Games on site practically for free.Since only tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies were sold out within minutes.It is noteworthy that this decision mediated again by Juan Antonio Samaranch became a catalyst for the International Paralympic Movement, because both athletes and future organizers would from now on have a standard of excellence to be demanded and fulfilled.The idea of unifying the organization of the two events under the auspices of the same people was so impactful that for the only time in history the Greek Olympic Committee in a mesure of approximation authorized the use of the Olympic fire during the Paralympic Games.Despite these innovative issues, the Barcelona organizers had serious financial problems. which could not be covered by the Spanish government. Thus, other alternatives were considered such as the extension of existing sponsorships and the signing of new and specific ones. As the financial amounts were not covered, some other partners appeared who were crucial to the success of the Games, civil society organizations such as Spain&#x27;s National Organization for the Blind (ONCE) which until 1993 was one of the owners of the country&#x27;s main private television channel, Telecinco, which created a lottery system that was also used as a form of population engagement as they also purchased 50% of the COOB&#x27;92 Paralympic department.

The city still managed to receive some additional public funds, and had the support of the ONCE Foundation who helped the Paralympic division of the COOB&#x27;92 to turn a joint venture with also helped to organize and also added funds of its own, buying a minority stake and also acting as a manager of personnel and resources to be applied. ONCE&#x27;s proposal perfectly fit the needs of COOB &#x27;92. And it included the idea that the Paralympic division could become a joint venture between the two interested parties. Thus, with a big political power, ONCE was predisposed to help the Paralympic division to seek new financial resources to cover the missing amounts.

After the Games in Catalonia, ONCE and COOB &#x27;92 also helped to organize the Paralympic Games for the Mentally Disabled, which were held in Madrid following the closing ceremonies in Barcelona.

Despite what had been agreed in 1989, in which Barcelona and Madrid would be the last Paralympics organized by the International Coordination Committee (ICC) and that from the Winter Games of 1994 onwards, the powers to organize the Paralympic Games would belong to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).

== Sports ==
The games consisted of 560 events spread over fifteen sports. Powerlifting and weightlifting were considered to be a single sport. Wheelchair tennis, a demonstration sport at the 1988 Summer Paralympics, was contested as an official medal sport for the first time. This was the first time that lawn bowls and snooker were dropped from the Summer Paralympic Games program.

<doc id="339979" wikidata="Q629500" url="?curid=339979" title="James Lick">
<text>James Lick (August 25, 1796 – October 1, 1876) was an American real estate investor, carpenter, piano builder, land baron, and patron of the sciences. The wealthiest man in California at the time of his death, Lick left the majority of his estate to social and scientific causes.

==Early years==
James Lick was born to Pennsylvania Dutch parents in Stumpstown (Fredericksburg), Pennsylvania on August 25, 1796. Lick&#x27;s paternal grandfather, William Lük, was a German immigrant from the Palatinate, and served in the American Revolutionary War. William&#x27;s son, John, anglicized the family name to Lick. 

The son of a carpenter, Lick began learning the craft at an early age. When he was twenty-one, he had a romance with Barbara Snavely, the mother of his only child, John Henry. They never married, and the romance failed. Lick left Stumpstown for Baltimore, Maryland, where he learned the art of piano making. He quickly mastered the skill, and moved to New York City and established his own shop. In 1821 Lick moved to Argentina, after learning that his pianos were being exported to South America.

==South American years==
Lick found his time in Buenos Aires to be difficult, because of his ignorance of Spanish and the turbulent political situation in the country. Despite this, his business thrived, and in 1825 Lick left Argentina to tour Europe for a year. On his return trip, his ship was captured by the Portuguese, and the passengers and crew were taken to Montevideo as prisoners of war. Lick escaped captivity and returned to Buenos Aires on foot.

In 1832, Lick returned to Stumpstown. He failed to reunite with Barbara Snavely and their son, and returned to Buenos Aires. He decided the political situation was too unstable and moved to Valparaíso, Chile. After four years, he again moved his business, this time to Lima, Peru.

In 1846, Lick returned to North America. Anticipating the Mexican–American War and the future annexation of California, he decided to settle there. A backlog of orders for his pianos delayed him 18 months, as his Mexican workers returned to their homes to join the Mexican Army. He finished the orders himself.

==California years==

Lick arrived in San Francisco, California, in January 1848, bringing with him his tools, work bench, $30,000 in gold (valued at approximately $2.75 million as of 2020), and 600 pounds (275 kilograms) of chocolate. The chocolate quickly sold, so Lick sent back word convincing his friend and neighbor in Peru, the confectioner Domingo Ghirardelli, to move to San Francisco, where he founded the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company.

Upon his arrival, Lick began buying real estate in the small village of San Francisco. The discovery of gold at Sutter&#x27;s Mill near Sacramento a few days after Lick&#x27;s arrival in the future state began the California Gold Rush and created a housing boom in San Francisco, which grew from about one thousand residents in 1848 to over twenty thousand by 1850. Lick got a touch of &quot;gold fever&quot; and sought to mine the metal, but after a week decided his fortune was to be made by owning land, not digging in it. Lick continued buying land in San Francisco, and also began buying farmland in and around San Jose, where he planted orchards and built the largest flour mill in the state. He invited his son to join him there in 1854; however, the younger Lick suffered from poor health and returned to Pennsylvania in 1863.

In 1861, Lick began construction of a hotel, known as &quot;Lick House&quot;, 41 Montgomery Street (Lick Street, 111 Sutter Street), at the intersection with Sutter Street, in San Francisco. The hotel had a dining room that could seat 400, based on a similar room at the palace of Versailles. Lick House was considered the finest hotel west of the Mississippi River. The hotel was destroyed in the fire following the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. The Hunter-Dulin Building was constructed 1925-1927.

Following the construction, Lick returned to his San Jose orchards. In 1874, Lick suffered a massive stroke in the kitchen of his home in Santa Clara. The following morning, he was found by his employee, Thomas Fraser, and taken to Lick House, where he could be better cared for. At the time of his illness, his estates, outside his considerable area in Santa Clara County and San Francisco, included large holdings around Lake Tahoe, a large ranch in Los Angeles County, and all of Santa Catalina Island, making Lick the richest man in California.

In the next three years, Lick spent his time determining how to dispense his fortune. He originally wanted to build giant statues of himself and his parents, and erect a pyramid larger than the Great Pyramid of Giza in his own honor in downtown San Francisco. Through the efforts of George Davidson, president of the California Academy of Sciences, Lick was persuaded to leave the greatest portion of his fortune to the establishment of a mountaintop observatory, with the largest, most powerful telescope yet built.

In 1874, he placed $3,000,000 ($65,200,000 relative value in 2017) at the disposal of seven trustees, by whom the funds were to be applied to specific uses. He replaced the board in 1875 with Faxon Atherton, John Nightingale, Bernard D. Murphy and his son, John H. Lick.

The principal divisions of the funds were:
* $700,000 to the University of California for the construction of an observatory and the installation of a telescope more powerful than any other
* $150,000 for the building and maintenance of free public James Lick Baths in San Francisco
* $540,000 to found and endow an institution of San Francisco to be known as the California School of Mechanic Arts
* $100,000 for the erection of three appropriate groups of bronze statuary to represent three periods in Californian history and to be placed before the city hall of San Francisco
* $60,000 to erect in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, a memorial to Francis Scott Key, author of “The Star-Spangled Banner”

Lick had had an interest in astronomy since at least 1860, when he and George Madeira, the founder of the first observatory in California, spent several nights observing. They had also met again in 1873 and Lick said that Madeira&#x27;s telescopes were the only ones he had ever used. In 1875, Thomas Fraser recommended a site at the summit of Mount Hamilton, near San Jose. Lick approved, on the condition that Santa Clara County build a &quot;first-class&quot; road to the site. The county agreed and the road was completed by the fall of 1876.

On October 1, 1876, Lick died in his room in Lick House, San Francisco. In 1887, his body was moved to its final resting place, under the future home of the Great Lick Refracting Telescope.

==Legacy==

* Lick&#x27;s will stipulated that all of his fortune should be used for the public good, including $700,000 for the building of the observatory.
* In 1888, Lick Observatory was completed and given to the University of California as the Lick Astronomical Department. The Observatory was the first permanently staffed mountain top observatory in the world and housed the largest refracting telescope in the world at that time.
* In 1887 Lick&#x27;s body was buried under the future site of the telescope, with a brass tablet bearing the inscription &quot;Here lies the body of James Lick.&quot; His will stipulates that fresh flowers be on his grave – always.
* James Lick Mansion in Santa Clara is a nationally registered historical landmark, and is leased at very low rates to non-profit organizations. the mansion was occupied by the S.A.F.E. Place.
* In 1884, the Lick Old Ladies&#x27; Home, later renamed the University Mound Ladies Home, was established in San Francisco with a grant from the Lick estate.
* The Conservatory of Flowers and the statue of Francis Scott Key in Golden Gate Park were donated to San Francisco by Lick.
* The Pioneer Monument in front of San Francisco&#x27;s City Hall was donated to the city by Lick.
* James Lick High School in San Jose and James Lick Middle School, Lick-Wilmerding High School, and the James Lick Freeway, all in San Francisco, are named in his honor.
* The Southern Pacific Railroad named a Control Point after Lick (CP Lick) on their Coast Line route in San Jose, California. At the same location there was also a Lick Station and Lick Branch rail line that went into San Jose&#x27;s Almaden Valley, which were abandoned in the early 1980s.
* The crater Lick on the Moon and the asteroid 1951 Lick are named after him.
* Lickdale, Pennsylvania, a village approximately 3 miles west of Fredericksburg, Pennsylvania (formerly Stumpstown), was named for James Lick. Lickdale was a prominent 19th century canal port along a branch of the Union Canal and contained a large commercial ice house.
* A large monument to James Lick was erected by the local citizens in the community cemetery in Fredericksburg, Pennsylvania.
* Lick is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, &quot;Sceloporus licki&quot;, which is endemic to Baja California Sur.

<doc id="339986" wikidata="Q3553520" url="?curid=339986" title="US Festival">
<text>The US Festival is the name of two early 1980s music and culture festivals held near San Bernardino, California.

==Background==
Steve Wozniak, cofounder of Apple and creator of the Apple I and Apple II personal computers, believed that the 1970s were the &quot;Me&quot; generation. He intended the US Festivals, with Bill Graham&#x27;s participation, to encourage the 1980s to be more community-oriented and combine technology with rock music. The first was held Labor Day weekend in September 1982, and the second less than nine months later, over Memorial Day weekend in May 1983.

Wozniak paid for the construction of a new open-air field venue and an enormous state-of-the-art temporary stage at Glen Helen Regional Park near Devore. This site was later to become home to the Glen Helen Amphitheater. The festival stage has resided at Disneyland in Anaheim since 1985, and has operated under various names and functions as the Videopolis dance club, the Videopolis Theatre, and the Fantasyland Theatre.

==September 1982==
The festival ran for three days in early September in weather; there were 36 arrests and a reported twelve drug overdoses. One &quot;associated&quot; murder of a hitchhiker occurred the day after the event. The festival lost a reported $12 million, and total attendance for the three days was about 400,000. The price for a three-day ticket was $37.50 ().

The festival featured the first use of the U.S.-Soviet Space Bridge, a two-way satellite hookup between the United States and the Soviet Union. Organizers had planned to have the US Festival and Soviet rock fans interact as a way to promote goodwill between the Cold War rivals, but it was too dark in California for cameras to pick up the festivalgoers when the link went live.

The 1983 festival ran for three days over Memorial Day weekend, along with an additional day on June 4. Colorado-based promoter Barry Fey replaced Graham as Wozniak&#x27;s business partner. The weather was slightly cooler than the September festival at , but the air quality in the region was the recorded worst in four years. The total attendance was reported at 670,000. Van Halen was reportedly paid $1.5 million to perform. The Clash demanded that $100,000 of their $500,000 for the performance be donated to charity before they took the stage for what would be their last show with guitarist Mick Jones before his firing in September. There were two reported deaths. The festival lost an estimated $12 million, as the 1982 festival had.

==In popular culture==
*The festival was parodied in the comic strip &quot;Bloom County&quot;, when Milo and his friends organize their own version of the &quot;US Festival&quot; as a political fundraiser for their Meadow Party. In this case, the name comes from the fact that the proceeds of the concert will &quot;go to &quot;us&quot;!&quot;, as in the promoters when asked in a fourth wall inquiry. Several well-known groups and musicians make cameo appearances, including actual US Festival headliners Van Halen and The Police, non-performers Culture Club and Barry Manilow, and the fictional heavy metal band Tess Turbo and The Blackheads.
*In 1984, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic parodied the US Festival (and its heavy financial losses) on an episode of &quot;Al TV&quot;, claiming that there would be a third edition of the festival, but without any live bands; the entire show would be released only on a cassette tape.
*In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homerpalooza&quot;, Homer Simpson refers to the US Festival as the greatest of all time.

==Home video releases==
In 2003, the band Triumph released a DVD of their US Festival performance, &quot;Live at the US Festival&quot;. In 2011 Shout! Factory announced plans to release a series of live concert DVDs from the US Festival. The first two of these releases, Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, were released on November 15, 2011. The third DVD release from Shout! Factory was Quiet Riot, released on March 27, 2012.

On November 19, 2013, Icon Television Music released The US Festival 1983 Days 1–3 on iTunes. This is the only US Festival release authorized by Steve Wozniak and the Unuson Corporation.

Judas Priest&#x27;s 30-year anniversary release of &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; included a DVD with footage of their set from the 1983 festival.

<doc id="339988" wikidata="Q3268010" url="?curid=339988" title="Circle K">
<text>Circle K Stores, Inc. is a North American chain of convenience stores headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, and owned by Alimentation Couche-Tard, Inc., based in Laval, Quebec. Founded in 1951 in El Paso, Texas, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1990 and went through several owners, before being acquired by Alimentation Couche-Tard in 2003. As of February 2020, Circle K has 9,799 stores in North America, 2,697 stores in Europe, and an additional 2,380 stores operating under franchise agreements worldwide.

In 2015, Circle K unveiled a new logo and brand identity, and Couche-Tard announced that it would deploy the brand globally, including Canada (except Quebec, rebranding from the Mac&#x27;s brand), Europe (rebranding from the Statoil brand), and the United States (rebranding from the Kangaroo Express brand and updating the existing Circle K brand).

==Overview==
Since the 1980s, Circle K has been the largest chain of company-owned and operated (non-franchised) convenience stores in the United States. With 7,230 stores overall in the United States, Circle K is second to 7-Eleven&#x27;s 9,348 stores (as of July 2019). As of February 2020, there are more than 14,800 stores with the Circle K brand worldwide.

Within the United States, Circle K owns and operates stores in 48 states (the two states without being Nebraska and Utah), with the largest concentration of stores found in Louisiana. Fuel is sold under various brands, with the Circle K and Shell brands as the most common. Other brands of fuel sold at Circle K stores include Valero, BP, Exxon, Marathon, Irving, Mobil, Esso and Phillips 66. Approximately 13% of stores worldwide do not sell fuel.

Circle K operates stores in the United States, Canada, Europe (the Nordics, Baltics, Poland, Russia, &amp; Ireland), and Hong Kong, and has franchises in Mexico (it partners with the Mexican stores &quot;Tiendas Extra&quot; created by Modelo Group), Cambodia, China, Egypt, Guam, Honduras, Indonesia, Jamaica, Macau, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. In Hong Kong and Macau, the stores are called &quot;OK&quot; in reference to the circle around the K. Circle K Hong Kong was founded in 1985 by Li &amp; Fung Retailing (later Fung Retailing) as licensee of the name; however, it was sold back to Couche-Tard in 2020. Circle K had 387 franchised locations throughout Hong Kong as of May 2020.
The Circle K brand entered the Canadian market in 2008, in connection with Couche-Tard&#x27;s acquisition of Irving Oil&#x27;s convenience store network. By 2019, more than 800 Mac&#x27;s branded stores had been rebranded to Circle K throughout central and western Canada.
In September 2015, Couche-Tard announced that Circle K would become the worldwide brand of all of its convenience stores, replacing Mac&#x27;s, Kangaroo Express, Statoil, and Holiday Stationstores brands (except the Couche-Tard brand in Quebec and the INGO brand in Europe). This global rebrand included the introduction of a new logo incorporating elements of its existing brands, improvements to its product offerings and technology, and investing in store-level improvements aimed at improving the customer experience. The rebranding occurred over the following five years; as of March 2020, all of Europe and 85% of North America had been updated with the Circle K brand and logo.

==History==

Entrepreneur Fred Hervey purchased three Kay&#x27;s Food Stores in El Paso, Texas , in 1951. Hervey renamed the stores as &quot;Circle K Food Stores, Inc.&quot; rather than &quot;Kay.&quot; He grew the Circle K chain into neighboring New Mexico and Arizona, which has been the company&#x27;s home base since 1957. (Hervey would go on to serve two terms as mayor of El Paso.)

By 1975, there were 1,000 Circle K stores across the U.S. In 1979, Circle K first expanded its reach into foreign markets via a licensing agreement which established the first Circle K stores in Japan by UNY. Until 2018, Circle K stores in Japan were run by the FamilyMart Company, that was named Circle K Sunkus Company until 2016 and was named Circle K Japan Company until 2004, which licensed the Circle K brand from Alimentation Couche-Tard. In 2018, all Circle K stores in Japan were converted to FamilyMart stores. In 1983, the number of stores increased to 2,180 with the purchase of the 960-store UtoteM chain in the western and southern United States.

Karl Eller, a prominent Phoenix, Arizona businessman, served as the company&#x27;s CEO from 1983 to 1990. During that time, Eller built Circle K into the second largest convenience store operation and the largest publicly owned convenience store chain in the U.S. with 4,631 stores in 32 states and an additional 1,300 or so licensed or joint venture stores in 13 foreign countries. Under Eller&#x27;s leadership, the company grew from annual sales of $747 million ($ in dollars) to over $3 billion ($ in dollars).

In 1988, the company sent a letter to its over 8,000 employees announcing that it will cut off the medical coverage of those who become sick or injured as a result of AIDS, alcohol, drug abuse or self-inflicted wounds. The company stated that &quot;There are certain lifestyle decisions that we are just not going to assure the results of.&quot;

Fortunes declined in the late 1980s as the U.S. economy began to slow down, and Circle K filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May 1990; Eller resigned as CEO. Some underperforming locations were sold or closed. In 1993 the company was purchased by Investcorp, an international investment group, and emerged from bankruptcy.

In 1996, Circle K was acquired by Tosco Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner and marketer, but kept its headquarters in Phoenix. Tosco was purchased in 2001 by Phillips Petroleum, which, in 2002, merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. In 2003, Circle K was purchased by Alimentation Couche-Tard, a large, multinational convenience store operator based in the Montreal area, for US$830 million ($ in dollars).

In 2005, Taiwan&#x27;s OK Convenience Store chain terminated its franchise agreement with Circle K.

In 2006, the company acquired the 90-store Spectrum chain serving Georgia and Alabama, the CFM chain in Missouri, 35 Sterling Dairy locations in Northwest Ohio, and 26 stores under various brands from Chico Enterprises of Morgantown, West Virginia. This came after the 2005 rebranding of the various Couche-Tard stores (Mac&#x27;s, Bigfoot, Dairy Mart, and Handy Andy) under the more nationally known Circle K brand.

In mid-2006, Alimentation Couche-Tard entered into a franchising agreement with ConocoPhillips to brand some of its company-owned stores as Circle K, in the western portion of the U.S. ConocoPhillips remodeled the stores into the Circle K scheme but continued to operate them. The stores continued to have the new ConocoPhillips unified canopy design and ProClean fuels. These stores were spun off as Phillips 66 in May 2012.

Another oil company, Canada-based Irving Oil, leased out its convenience stores operating under the Bluecanoe and Mainway banners in the United States and Atlantic Canada to Couche-Tard, which rebranded the locations to Circle K in July 2008, while still selling Irving-branded fuel. However, the Mainways in Newfoundland and Labrador did not change until summer 2010. The parties had earlier formed a similar partnership in Quebec, with the stores there operated as Couche-Tard.

In April 2009, ExxonMobil sold 43 Phoenix stores to parent company Couche-Tard as part of a sale of the larger On the Run franchise. These 43 stores were to be rebranded under the Circle K name.

In July 2010, Circle K had dropped down to fourth rank in number of stores (3,455), behind 7-Eleven (6,523 stores), BP (4,730 stores), and Shell (4,630 convenience stores) in 2010.

In April 2012, Circle K purchased Norway-based Statoil Fuel and Retail ASA and its 2300 fuel stations located in Scandinavia, the Baltics, Poland, and western Russia for $2.8 billion.

On February 10, 2014, Modelo Group sold the Tiendas Extra brand of stores to the Mexican franchise of Circle K, Circulo K.

On December 18, 2014, Couche-Tard announced its acquisition of The Pantry for $860 million all-cash tender ($ in dollars). The acquisition closed in March 2015. Following the closing, all stores that were owned and operated by The Pantry, many of them under the &quot;Kangaroo Express&quot; name, were expected to be rebranded under the Circle K banner.

On August 12, 2015, Circle K opened its first five convenience stores in Costa Rica, Central America, after having bought and rebranded the local convenience store chain Delimart.

On September 23, 2015, Couche-Tard unveiled a refreshed brand identity for Circle K, and announced that the Statoil (Northern, Central and Eastern Europe) and Mac&#x27;s (English Canada) brands would be converted to Circle K.

In 2016, Couche-Tard acquired the Irish service station chain Topaz. In April 2018, Couche-Tard announced that they too would be rebranded to Circle K. Couche-Tard similarly acquired Imperial Oil&#x27;s Esso retail locations in Ontario (228) and Quebec (50) the same year, and rebranded the convenience stores in Ontario (many of which previously operated under the On the Run brand) to Circle K.

In 2017, Couche-Tard completed its acquisition of CST Brands, adding stores formerly owned by Valero Energy, and a portion of the Ultramar chain in Canada to Circle K (with the latter also switching fuel suppliers to Irving).

Also in 2017, Couche-Tard bought Holiday Stationstores, a Minnesota-based chain of fuel stations in the Midwestern United States. Couche-Tard would integrate business practices from Holiday into the Circle K business, including its food service model and car wash subscriptions. Some locations also piloted store formats patterned after that of Holiday.

In November 2018, Circle K opened its first store in New Zealand through master franchisee Pamma Retail Group.

In September 2021, Circle K announced the purchase of 10 convenience and food stores from the Griffin Group in Ireland. All the stores being bought are in Dublin and located in busy areas such as O’Connell Street, College Green, Grafton Street and Sandyford.

In February 2022, Couche-Tard announced that it would rebrand 12 Holiday Stationstores locations in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to Circle K.
In April 2022, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Couche-Tard was considering the British convenience store and restaurant operator EG Group, which would have given it a larger presence in Australia, Western Europe, and EG Group&#x27;s home market of the United Kingdom, as well as the U.S. (where it had bought Kroger&#x27;s convenience store business, as well as Cumberland Farms), especially in Florida, New England, and Ohio. EG Group would instead enter into a sale and leaseback agreement for its U.S. stores, and most of its UK gas stations and restaurants would be sold to retail chain Asda (which had recently been acquired by EG founders Mohsin and Zuber Issa) in 2023, along with EG On the Move—a separate company led by Zuber.

On August 19, 2024, Couche-Tard announced it would buy Pittsburgh-based GetGo from Giant Eagle, greatly expanding Circle K&#x27;s presence in Pennsylvania (all of its existing stores in that state are descended from Lawson&#x27;s/Dairy Mart) and complimenting its existing stores in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, and add to its stores in Maryland.

==Wage violations==

A 2021 report on wage theft by the Center for Public Integrity named Circle K as one of the &quot;worst offenders&quot; in the United States. A class-action lawsuit was brought against the company in 2014, for which the company agreed in 2019 to pay a settlement of US$8.3 million. Circle K settled a similar class-action lawsuit in 2015 as well.

==Products==
Fountain drinks at Circle K are sold in Polar Pop cups, previously called Thirst Busters, and are available in expanded polystyrene cups. In areas where expanded polystyrene containers are illegal, plastic or paper cups are offered. The 52-ounce cups are plastic. Most American locations offer any size, 32 ounce or under, for under $1, while 52 ounces or above cups are priced at over a dollar. The price point of its 44-ounce size (marketed as &quot;Epic XL&quot; in some regions) may vary, as it may be under or over $1, depending on the region.

The Polar Pop was first introduced in Bigfoot convenience stores by Johnson Oil Company in Columbus, Indiana, prior to its acquisition by Alimentation Couche-Tard. After the acquisition, the company began rebranding fountain drinks in other stores owned by Couche-Tard. As of 2018, Circle K sells 17 Polar Pops every second in the United States.

The Froster, which was introduced to Mac&#x27;s stores in 1998, became very popular throughout Western Canada and Ontario. The American version of the Froster was introduced in 1999.

==Sponsorship==
Circle K was a part-time primary sponsor of the No. 28 IndyCar Series racecar driven by Ryan Hunter-Reay of Andretti Autosport between 2011 and 2013. In 2014, it switched to KVSH Racing driver Sébastien Bourdais. Circle K, along with Oberto Sausage Company, currently sponsors Marco Andretti.

In 2017, Circle K went to NASCAR, sponsoring Matt Kenseth and Joe Gibbs Racing with full livery for six races. It was on the car when Kenseth won his final NASCAR Cup Race at that year&#x27;s fall race at Phoenix Raceway.

Also in 2017, Circle K became the official shirt sponsor of United Soccer League side North Carolina FC and signed a two-year sponsorship agreement with the Lithuanian Basketball League.

Due to its sizable presence in Greater Cleveland, from the former Lawson/Dairy Mart stores, Circle K sponsors the Cleveland Guardians strikeout sign. It is located in center field at Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio. The &quot;K&quot; logo represents the &quot;K&quot; used for strikeouts in traditional baseball scorekeeping and is replicated with each strikeout. The same sponsorship is in place with the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona. If the Diamondbacks strikeout ten batters or more, the game&#x27;s attendees receive a voucher for a free cup of Polar Pop, while Guardians fans receive the same voucher after select home games.

In May 2017, a sponsored Circle K Power Cube was introduced into the online game &quot;Ingress&quot;.

<doc id="339989" wikidata="Q316454" url="?curid=339989" title="Don Henley">
<text>Donald Hugh Henley (born July 22, 1947) is an American musician who is a founding member of the rock band Eagles, for whom he is the drummer and co-lead vocalist, as well as its sole continuous member. Henley sang the lead vocals on Eagles songs such as &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;, &quot;Desperado&quot;, &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, &quot;Hotel California&quot;, &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;, &quot;Victim of Love&quot;, &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, &quot;The Long Run&quot;, and &quot;Get Over It&quot;.

After the Eagles disbanded in 1980, Henley pursued a solo career and released his debut studio album &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still&quot;, in 1982. He has released five studio albums, two compilation albums, and one live DVD. His solo tracks include &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;, &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, &quot;All She Wants to Do Is Dance&quot;, &quot;Sunset Grill&quot;, &quot;New York Minute&quot;, &quot;Not Enough Love in the World&quot;, &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;, &quot;The Last Worthless Evening&quot; and &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;.

The Eagles have sold over 150 million albums worldwide, won six Grammy Awards, had five number one singles, 17 top 40 singles, and six number one albums. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and are the highest selling American band in history. As a solo artist, Henley has sold over 10 million albums worldwide, had eight top 40 singles, won two Grammy Awards and five MTV Video Music Awards. Combined with the Eagles and as a solo artist, Henley has released 25 top 40 singles on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He has also released seven studio albums with the Eagles and five as a solo artist. In 2008, he was ranked as the 87th greatest singer of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

Henley has also played a founding role in several environmental and political causes, most notably the Walden Woods Project. From 1994 to 2016, he divided his musical activities between the Eagles and his solo career.

==Early life==
Born in Gilmer, Texas, Henley grew up in the small northeast Texas town of Linden. He is the son of Hughlene (née McWhorter; 1916–2003) and C. J. Henley (1907–1972), and has English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Henley attended Linden-Kildare High School, where he initially played football; due to his relatively small build, his coach suggested that he quit, and he joined the high school band instead. He first played the trombone, then moved to the percussion section.

After graduating from high school in 1965, Henley attended Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, then North Texas State University in Denton from 1967 to 1969. He left school to spend time with his father, who was dying of heart and arterial disease.

==Career beginnings==
While still at high school, Henley was asked to join a Dixieland band formed by his childhood friend Richard Bowden&#x27;s father Elmer, together with another school friend Jerry Surratt. They then formed a band called the Four Speeds. In 1964 the band was renamed Felicity and went through a number of changes in band personnel. As Felicity they were signed to a local producer and released a Henley-penned song called &quot;Hurtin&#x27;&quot;. In 1969, they met by chance fellow Texan Kenny Rogers who took an interest in their band. They changed their name to Shiloh and recorded a few songs for Rogers, and &quot;Jennifer (O&#x27; My Lady)&quot; was released as their first single.

Surratt died in a dirt bike accident just before their single was released. The band members then became Henley, Richard Bowden and his cousin Michael Bowden, Al Perkins, and Jim Ed Norman. Rogers helped sign the band to Amos Records, and brought the band to Los Angeles in June 1970. They recorded a self-titled album produced by Rogers at Larrabee Studios while living at the home of Rogers for a few months. Shiloh disbanded in 1971 over the band&#x27;s leadership and creative differences between Henley and Bowden.

In Los Angeles, Henley met Glenn Frey as they were both signed to the same label (Frey was signed to Amos Records, together with JD Souther, as the duo Longbranch Pennywhistle), and they were recruited by John Boylan to be members of Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s backup band for her tour in 1971. Touring with her was the catalyst for forming a group, as Henley and Frey decided to form their own band. They were joined by Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon who also played in Ronstadt&#x27;s backing band (the four had, however, played together only once previously, as the band personnel changed) and became the Eagles.

==Eagles==

Eagles were formed in 1971, and signed to David Geffen&#x27;s label Asylum Records. They released their first studio album in 1972, which contained the hit song &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, co-written by Jackson Browne. During the band&#x27;s run, Henley co-wrote (usually with Frey) most of the band&#x27;s best-known songs. &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;, which was co-written with Leadon, was his first commercially successful song, while &quot;Desperado&quot; marks the beginning of his songwriting partnership with Frey.

Henley sang lead vocals on many of the band&#x27;s popular songs, including &quot;Desperado&quot;, &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;, &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, &quot;Hotel California&quot;, &quot;The Long Run&quot;, &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; and &quot;Wasted Time&quot;. Eagles won numerous Grammy Awards during the 1970s and became one of the world&#x27;s most successful rock bands of all time. They are also among the top five overall bestselling bands of all time in America, and the highest-selling American band in U.S. history. Henley and Frey have been called the American version of Lennon and McCartney.

The band broke up in 1980, following a difficult tour and personal tensions that arose during the recording of &quot;The Long Run&quot;. Eagles reunited 14 years later in 1994. Henley continues to tour and record with the Eagles. Their most recent album, &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;, was released in 2007. The band had a number of highly successful tours, such as the Hell Freezes Over Tour (1994–1996), and Long Road Out of Eden Tour. On April 1, 2013, during a concert at the Casino Rama in Rama, Ontario, Henley announced the History of the Eagles Tour, which began in July 2013 and ended in July 2015, six months before Frey&#x27;s death. At the 2016 Grammy Awards, the Eagles and Jackson Browne performed &quot;Take It Easy&quot; as a tribute to Frey.

On his songwriting in the band, Henley stated in a March 2001 interview on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; that &quot;rock bands work best as a benevolent dictatorship&quot;, with the principal songwriters in a band (in the case of Eagles, &quot;me and Glenn Frey&quot;) being the ones that will likely hold the power.

==Solo career==
Following the breakup of the Eagles, Henley embarked on a solo career. He and Stevie Nicks (his girlfriend at the time) had duetted on her Top 10 Pop and Adult Contemporary hit &quot;Leather and Lace&quot;, written by Nicks for Waylon Jennings and his wife Jessi Colter, in late 1982. Henley&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still&quot;, was a moderate seller. The single &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at the beginning of 1983 and earned a Gold-certified single for sales of over a million copies in the US. It was Henley&#x27;s all-time biggest solo hit single, and also was nominated for a Grammy Award. Henley also contributed &quot;Love Rules&quot; to the 1982 &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; movie soundtrack.

This was followed in 1984 by the album, &quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot;. A single release, &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The music video for the song was directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino and won several MTV Video Music Awards including Best Video of the Year. Henley also won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song. Several other songs on the album, &quot;All She Wants to Do Is Dance&quot; (No. 9 on Hot 100), &quot;Not Enough Love in the World&quot; (No. 34) and &quot;Sunset Grill&quot; (No. 22) also received considerable airplay. He then had a No. 3 album rock chart hit with &quot;Who Owns This Place?&quot; from 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Color of Money&quot; soundtrack.
Henley&#x27;s next album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;, was even more successful. The album&#x27;s title track, a collaboration with Bruce Hornsby, reached No. 8 as a single. &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;, &quot;The Last Worthless Evening&quot; and &quot;New York Minute&quot; were among other songs that gained radio airplay. Henley again won the Best Male Rock Vocal Performance Grammy Award in 1990 for &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;. Also in 1990, Henley made a brief appearance on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; series.

In 1995, Henley released the single &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot; to promote his greatest hits solo album &quot;Actual Miles: Henley&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;.

MusicRadar called Henley one of the greatest singing drummers of all time.

In live shows, Henley plays drums and sings simultaneously on some Eagles songs. On his solo songs and other Eagles songs, he plays electric guitar and simultaneously sings or just sings solo. Occasionally Eagles songs would get drastic rearrangements, such as &quot;Hotel California&quot; with four trombones.

==Lawsuits with Geffen Records==
Henley spent many years in legal entanglements with Geffen Records. In January 1993, following prolonged tensions between Henley and the label, the dispute went public and the record company filed a $30 million breach-of-contract suit in California Superior Court after receiving a notice from Henley saying that he was terminating his contract even though he reportedly owed the company two more studio albums and a greatest-hits collection. Henley wanted to sign a publishing deal with EMI that would have been worth a few million dollars. Geffen Records stopped this from happening, which in turn upset Henley.

Geffen Records claimed that Henley was in breach of contract and Henley attempted to get out of his contract in 1993 based on a 50-year-old California statute. Under the statute, enacted to free actors from long-term studio deals, entertainers cannot be forced to work for any company for more than seven years. Geffen Records did not want Henley signing with any other label, and had an agreement with Sony and EMI that they would not sign Henley. He counter-sued Geffen Records, claiming that he was &quot;blackballed&quot; by David Geffen, who had made agreements with other record labels to not sign him.

Henley eventually became an outspoken advocate for musicians&#x27; rights, taking a stand against music labels who he believes refuse to pay bands their due royalties. Henley came to terms with Geffen Records when the Eagles&#x27; reunion took off and the company eventually took a large chunk of the profit from the reunion album. Glenn Frey was also in legal entanglements with his label, MCA Records (whose parent company had also acquired Geffen). Before the Eagles reunion tour could begin, the band had to file a suit against Elektra Records, which had planned to release a new Eagles &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. The band won that battle.

A long period without a new recording followed as Henley waited out a dispute with his record company while also participating in a 1994 Eagles reunion tour and live album. During the hiatus, Henley recorded a cover of &quot;Sit Down, You&#x27;re Rockin&#x27; the Boat&quot; for the film &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, and provided the background vocals for country star Trisha Yearwood&#x27;s hit single &quot;Walkaway Joe&quot;, and duetted with Patty Smyth on &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot;, and Roger Waters on &quot;Watching TV&quot; on Waters&#x27; &quot;Amused to Death&quot; album, in 1992. Henley provided the voice of Henry Faust in &quot;Randy Newman&#x27;s Faust&quot;, a 1993 musical which was released on compact disc that year.

Henley and Courtney Love testified at a California Senate hearing on that state&#x27;s contractual laws in Sacramento on September 5, 2001. In 2002 Henley became the head of the Recording Artists&#x27; Coalition. The coalition&#x27;s primary aim was to raise money to mount a legal and political battle against the major record labels. Henley says the group seeks to change the fundamental rules that govern most recording contracts, including copyright ownership, long-term control of intellectual property and unfair accounting practices. This group filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the Napster case, urging District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel not to accept the industry&#x27;s broad claims of works made for hire authorship.

==&quot;Inside Job&quot; and recent solo work==

In 2000, after 11 years, Henley released another solo album titled &quot;Inside Job&quot; which peaked at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and contained the new singles &quot;Taking You Home&quot;, &quot;Everything Is Different Now&quot;, &quot;Workin&#x27; It&quot; and &quot;For My Wedding&quot;. He performed songs from the album in a &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; episode during 2000. In 2002 a live DVD entitled &quot;Don Henley: Live Inside Job&quot; was released. In 2005, Henley opened 10 of Stevie Nicks&#x27; concerts on her Two Voices Tour.

Henley performed duets with Kenny Rogers on Rogers&#x27; 2006 release &quot;Water &amp; Bridges&quot;, titled &quot;Calling Me&quot; and on Reba McEntire&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;,&quot; performing &quot;Break Each Other&#x27;s Hearts Again&quot;.

In a 2007 interview with CNN, while discussing the future of the Eagles, Henley indicated he still has plans for more records: &quot;But we all have some solo plans still. I still have a contract with a major label [Warner] for a couple of solo albums.&quot; In January 2011, Henley commenced work on a solo album of country covers featuring special guests. Ronnie Dunn from Brooks &amp; Dunn and Alison Krauss have recorded a song with Henley for the album.

On July 18, 2015, Henley started pre-orders of his album, &quot;Cass County&quot;. The album was released on September 25.

Henley was honored with the &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; award during the East Texas Music Awards event in 2015.

==Political and other causes==
In 1990, Henley founded the Walden Woods Project to help protect &quot;Walden Woods&quot; from development. The Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods was started in 1998 to provide for research and education regarding Henry David Thoreau. In 1993, a compilation album titled &quot;Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles&quot; was released, with a portion of the royalties from the sales going to the Walden Woods Project. In 2005, he had a fundraiser concert with Elton John and others to buy Brister&#x27;s Hill, part of Walden Woods, and turn it into a hiking trail.

Henley co-founded the non-profit Caddo Lake Institute (CLI) in 1993 with Dwight K. Shellman to underwrite ecological education and research. As part of the Caddo Lake Coalition, CLI helps protect the Texas wetland where Henley spent much of his childhood. As a result of the Caddo Lake Institute&#x27;s success in restoring and protecting Caddo Lake&#x27;s wetlands, Caddo Lake was included as the 13th site in the United States on the Ramsar Convention&#x27;s list of significant wetlands. The Ramsar Convention is an intergovernmental treaty that provides a framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources.

In 2000, Henley co-founded the Recording Artists&#x27; Coalition, a group founded to protect musicians&#x27; rights against common music industry business practices. In this role he testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 2001 and the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in 2003.

Henley in a 2008 interview revealed that he contributes to many other charitable causes such as The Race to Erase MS, and the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. He is also a member of the CuriosityStream Advisory Board.

A lifelong supporter of the Democratic Party, Henley has also been a generous donor to political campaigns of Democrats. In 2008, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported Henley had donated over $680,000 to political candidates since 1978. Several tracks on the 2007 Eagles album &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot; (including the title track, which Henley co-wrote) are sharply critical of the Iraq War and other policies of the Bush administration.

Henley&#x27;s liberal political leanings led to tension with guitarist Bernie Leadon when he submitted the song &quot;I Wish You Peace&quot; for inclusion on &quot;One of These Nights&quot;. Henley was not thrilled that the song was co-written by Patti Davis, who was the daughter of Ronald Reagan, the Republican governor of California at that time.

Henley endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

In a fundraiser hosted by Matthew McConaughey to raise money for Texans affected by the snowstorms in February 2021, Henley performed &quot;Snow&quot;, which was written by Jesse Winchester. The show premiered on March 21, 2021. Henley remarked &quot;On that bitter cold Tuesday of February 16th, we had a busted pipe at the attic at my house, and me and my family were shoveling and bailing for 8 or 9 hours there. Nothing, of course, compared to the shoveling and bailing that&#x27;s been going on down in the state capitol the past 3 weeks.&quot;

In a &quot;Discover Concord&quot; magazine in the summer of 2021, Henley spoke of the Walden Woods Foundation as well as his life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Henley noted that &quot;I think that each and every one of us has a duty to help care for our natural environment, even if it&#x27;s something as simple as not throwing your fast-food wrapper out the car window.&quot;

=== Testifying to Congress over the state of DMCA ===
On June 2, 2020, Henley gave testimony to the United States Congress regarding his views on copyright law, specifically the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Henley argued that the act is outdated, unfair to artists, and that it is not sufficiently enforced. These statements in turn sparked public backlash against him from parties believing that DMCA enforcement is already too harshly enforced and often abused. Opposition to Henley&#x27;s views was particularly widespread among online content creators, many of whom had been subject to YouTube copyright strikes pertaining to the use of songs by Henley or the Eagles, regardless of the legitimacy of the claim in question.

Henley is known for actively taking down online content involving music for which he holds copyright, doing so even when the content in question is considered fair use. According to research conducted by music producer and teacher Rick Beato, Henley has been responsible for manual takedowns of instructional videos teaching how to play Eagles songs despite such educational material falling under fair use protections.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Henley became involved with Lorelei Shellist, and the breakup of their relationship was the inspiration for the song &quot;Wasted Time&quot; and parts of the lyrics for &quot;Hotel California&quot;. Late in 1975, Henley started dating Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks as her relationship with Lindsey Buckingham came to an end. The relationship lasted on and off for around two years, and Henley claimed that Nicks wrote her song &quot;Sara&quot; about their unborn child. Nicks ultimately made a decision to have an abortion. Henley then began a three-year-long relationship with actress/model and Bond girl Lois Chiles.

In the early 1980s, Henley was engaged to &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; actress Maren Jensen. His first solo album &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still&quot; was dedicated to Jensen, who also sang harmony vocals on the song &quot;Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot;. He and Jensen separated in 1986.

In 1995, Henley married model and socialite Sharon Summerall. Performers at the wedding included Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Billy Joel, John Fogerty, Jackson Browne, Sheryl Crow, Glenn Frey, and Tony Bennett. Henley later wrote the song &quot;Everything Is Different Now&quot; from the album &quot;Inside Job&quot; for Summerall. Summerall has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. They have three children together: two daughters and a son.

In 2012, Henley was estimated to be the fourth-wealthiest drummer in the world (behind Ringo Starr, Phil Collins, and Dave Grohl), with a combined fortune of $200 million.

In February 2024, it was revealed that Henley had stalled plans for an Eagles biography that writer Ed Sanders planned to publish. Friction between the two of them was the stated reason.

===1980 arrest===
Henley called paramedics to his home on November 21, 1980, and there they found a naked 16-year-old girl claiming she had overdosed on quaaludes and cocaine. She was arrested for prostitution, while a 15-year-old girl found in the house was arrested for being under the influence of drugs. Henley was also arrested and subsequently charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He pled no contest, was fined $2,500 and put on two years&#x27; probation. Lois Chiles, who was no longer in a relationship with Henley at the time of the incident, later said, &quot;I was shocked to hear about it. He didn&#x27;t have drugs around the house. It was an accident, I&#x27;m sure&quot;. The media attention from this incident was the primary inspiration for the song &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;.

In February 2024, ahead of another criminal trial in New York over the alleged theft of Henley’s original handwritten lyrics for many Eagles hits, Judge Curtis Farber sided with attorneys for the two young female defendants arrested for prostitution and drug use. The attorneys had sought to introduce a letter Henley wrote to a Santa Monica probation officer giving his account of the events leading up to Henley&#x27;s arrest. Contrary to Henley’s 1991 claim that he was hosting a farewell party for the Eagles’ road crew, the letter stated that Henley actually “didn’t want to see any of my friends”. Instead he placed a call to a madam, who sent a girl over to his home. Henley said he and the girl had a few drinks and did some cocaine, and later she had what appeared to him to be an epileptic seizure. Henley called paramedics, but the girl had recovered by the time they arrived. Henley said it was only when the paramedics asked the girl questions that he learned she was underage. A while later, officers from the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Sexually Exploited Child Unit arrived and placed Henley and the girl under arrest. During the trial testimony, Henley described the incident leading to his arrest as &quot;a poor decision which I regret to this day,” stating that he sought an &quot;escape&quot; due to the depression he developed after the Eagles&#x27; recent breakup.

<text>Mario Del Monaco (27 July 191516 October 1982) was an Italian operatic tenor.

==Biography==
Del Monaco was born in Florence, into a musical upper-class family, to a Neapolitan father and to a mother of Sicilian descent. As a young boy he studied the violin but had a passion for singing. He graduated from the Rossini Conservatory at Pesaro, where he first met and sang with Renata Tebaldi, with whom he would form something of an operatic &quot;dream team&quot; of the 1950s. His early mentors as a singer included Arturo Melocchi, his teacher at Pesaro, and Cherubino Raffaelli, who recognized his talent and helped launch his career.

That career began in earnest with Del Monaco&#x27;s debut on 31 December 1940 as Pinkerton at the Puccini Theater in Milan. (His initial appearance in an opera had occurred the previous year, however, in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; in Pesaro.) He sang in Italy during the Second World War and married, in 1941, Rina Filipini. In 1946, he appeared at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, for the first time. During the ensuing years he became famous not only in London but also across the operatic world for his powerful voice and heroic acting style. It was almost heldentenor-like in scope but Del Monaco was no Wagnerian, confining his activities overwhelmingly to the Italian repertoire. He sang Wagner in concerts, from &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;.
Del Monaco sang at the New York Metropolitan Opera from 1951 to 1959, enjoying particular success in dramatic Verdi parts such as Radamès. He soon established himself as one of four Italian tenor superstars who reached the peak of their fame in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, the others being Giuseppe Di Stefano, Carlo Bergonzi and Franco Corelli. Del Monaco&#x27;s trademark roles during this period were Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;.

He first tackled Otello in 1950 and kept refining his interpretation throughout his career. It is said that he sang Otello 427 times. However, the book published by Elisabetta Romagnolo, &quot;Mario Del Monaco, Monumentum aere perennius, Azzali 2002&quot;, lists only 218 appearances by him as Otello, which is a more realistic figure. Although Otello was his best role, throughout his career, Del Monaco sang a number of other roles with great acclaim, for example: Canio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (Leoncavallo), Radames in &quot;Aida&quot; (Verdi), Don Jose in &quot;Carmen&quot; (Bizet), Chenier in &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; (Giordano), Manrico in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (Verdi), Samson in &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (Saint-Saëns), and Don Alvaro in &quot;La forza del destino&quot; (Verdi).

Del Monaco sang at La Scala with Maria Callas in 1955 (Andrea Chénier, Norma) and starred with Callas in &quot;Norma&quot; at the Met in 1956, amongst other Callas pairings.

Del Monaco made his first recordings in Milan in 1948 for HMV. Later, he was partnered by Renata Tebaldi in a long series of Verdi and Puccini operas recorded for Decca. On the same label was his 1969 recording of Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Fedora&quot;, opposite Magda Olivero and Tito Gobbi.

His ringing voice and virile appearance earned him the nickname of the &quot;Brass Bull of Milan&quot;.

The soprano Magda Olivero noted in an interview with Stefan Zucker that:

When Del Monaco and I sang &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; together at La Scala [in 1959] he explained his whole vocal technique to me. When he finished I said, &quot;My dear Del Monaco, if I had to put into practice all the things you’ve told me, I’d stop singing right away and just disappear.&quot; The technique was so complicated: you push the larynx down, then you push this up, then you do that—in short, it made my head spin just to hear everything he did.
In 1975 he retired from the stage. He died in Mestre as a result of nephritis. He was buried in his Otello costume.

His son Giancarlo Del Monaco is an opera director and theatre manager; his niece Donella Del Monaco, a soprano, is the singer of Opus Avantra.

<text>Patrick (Pat) McGuigan (10 February 1935 – 27 June 1987) was an Irish singer born in Clones, County Monaghan.

McGuigan, who spelled his name McGeegan for the stage, first came to prominence in Ireland when his single with the Big Four reached number 7 in the Irish charts in 1963. Five years later he was again in the national spotlight in 1968, when he competed for Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest (as Pat McGeegan) with the song Chance of a Lifetime, arriving in fourth place. The song spent one week at number-one in the Irish Singles Chart in April 1968. Subsequently, he made some albums and released many singles, but never reached the Irish top twenty again. His rendition of &quot;Danny Boy&quot; became well known. McGuigan was also a respected songwriter.

His son, Barry McGuigan, was world featherweight boxing champion in 1985–1986. Pat McGuigan became known in the United States after his son&#x27;s world title winning victory over Eusebio Pedroza. On 13 June 1986, he sang the American national anthem before the world championship bout between Carlos Santos and &quot;Buster Drayton&quot; in New Jersey.

Pat McGuigan died after a period of illness in 1987. He was 52 years old.

<doc id="339992" wikidata="Q422187" url="?curid=339992" title="Myhill–Nerode theorem">
<text>In the theory of formal languages, the Myhill–Nerode theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a language to be regular. The theorem is named for John Myhill and Anil Nerode, who proved it at the University of Chicago in 1957 .

==Statement==
Given a language formula_1, and a pair of strings formula_2 and formula_3, define a distinguishing extension to be a string formula_4 such that
exactly one of the two strings formula_5 and formula_6 belongs to formula_1.
Define a relation formula_8 on strings as formula_9 if there is no distinguishing extension for formula_2 and formula_3. It is easy to show that formula_8 is an equivalence relation on strings, and thus it divides the set of all strings into equivalence classes.

The Myhill–Nerode theorem states that a language formula_1 is regular if and only if formula_8 has a finite number of equivalence classes, and moreover, that this number is equal to the number of states in the minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) accepting formula_1. Furthermore, every minimal DFA for the language is isomorphic to the canonical one .

Generally, for any language, the constructed automaton is a &quot;state automaton&quot; acceptor. However, it does not necessarily have &quot;finitely&quot; many states. The Myhill–Nerode theorem shows that finiteness is necessary and sufficient for language regularity.

Some authors refer to the formula_8 relation as Nerode congruence, in honor of Anil Nerode.


==Use and consequences==
The Myhill–Nerode theorem may be used to show that a language formula_1 is regular by proving that the number of equivalence classes of formula_8 is finite. This may be done by an exhaustive case analysis in which, beginning from the empty string, distinguishing extensions are used to find additional equivalence classes until no more can be found. For example, the language consisting of binary representations of numbers that can be divided by 3 is regular. Given the empty string, formula_19 (or formula_20), formula_21, and formula_22 are distinguishing extensions resulting in the three classes (corresponding to numbers that give remainders 0, 1 and 2 when divided by 3), but after this step there is no distinguishing extension anymore. The minimal automaton accepting our language would have three states corresponding to these three equivalence classes.

Another immediate corollary of the theorem is that if for a language formula_1 the relation formula_8 has infinitely many equivalence classes, it is regular. It is this corollary that is frequently used to prove that a language is not regular.

== Generalizations ==
The Myhill–Nerode theorem can be generalized to tree automata.

<text>Stanley Chapman (15 September 1925 – 26 May 2009) was a British architect, designer, translator and writer. His interests included theatre and &#x27;pataphysics. He was involved with founding the &quot;National Theatre&quot; of London, was a member of Oulipo of the year 1961, founder of the Outrapo and a member also of the French Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique, the London Institute of &#x27;Pataphysics and the Lewis Carroll Society. In the early 1950s he contributed poems and designed covers for the literary magazines Listen and Stand and contributed translations to Chanticleer, a magazine edited by the poet Ewart Milne. His English translation of &quot;A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems&quot; was received with &quot;admiring stupefaction&quot; by Raymond Queneau.

<text>The Christian Heritage Party of New Zealand (CHP, known for a time simply as Christian Heritage New Zealand) was a New Zealand political party espousing Christian values and conservative views on social policy. Although it never won seats in an election, it came close to doing so in 1996 as part of the Christian Coalition and briefly had a member in Parliament.

On 3 October 2006, the Party said it would disband to allow &quot;new things to arise in Christian politics in New Zealand&quot;. This came after a highly publicised scandal which resulted in its leader, Graham Capill, going to jail for committing sex crimes against children.
== Policies ==

According to Christian Heritage New Zealand&#x27;s self-description, the party aimed &quot;to provide leadership that takes the initiative in building a culture that affirms marriage, strengthens families, and celebrates life as a precious gift of God. We believe these are the key issues that need to be addressed if we are to make an impact for the next generation.&quot;

It described its three key policies as &quot;Affirming Marriage, Building Families and Celebrating Life&quot;, i.e. opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion and support of law and order.

The party espoused strongly conservative views on social policy. It favoured law changes to strengthen heterosexual marriage and to prevent same-sex marriage and civil unions. The CHP had an anti-abortion stance. For most of its existence, the party supported the re-introduction into New Zealand of capital punishment (abolished in 1989). Christian Heritage NZ supported restrictions on prostitution, as well as mandatory standards for television with a view to reducing violence and pornography. This conservatism extended to the exhibition of art and in particular two exhibitions held at the City Gallery in Wellington, the American&#x27;s Robert Mapplethorpe in 1995 and Keith Haring in 1999. The Party held demonstrations including a ‘Rally for Righteousness’ outside the gallery and circulated petitions to have works removed. The Director of the City Gallery Paula Savage blamed the Heritage Party for low attendances at the Haring show with only 30,000 visitors against expectations of twice that number.

In economic policy, Christian Heritage espoused moderately right-wing policies, and stressed that &quot;economic policy cannot be viewed in isolation&quot; from social matters. In education the Christian Heritage Party emphasised parental influence over the curriculum and parents&#x27; rights to choose the school their child attended. The party supported victims&#x27; rights.

CHP supported New Zealand&#x27;s constitutional monarchy. In foreign affairs, the party supported New Zealand&#x27;s alliance with Australia and a resumption of its alliance with the United States. From the New Zealand general election, 1999, the CHP supported New Zealand&#x27;s anti-nuclear policy, whereas beforehand it had endorsed return to the ANZUS alliance, but not necessarily the return of nuclear-armed ships.

CHP supported the Treaty of Waitangi and the work of the Waitangi Tribunal and urged settlement of Māori land claims and racial reconciliation.

Christian Heritage NZ claimed broad-based support from members of various Protestant denominations and from the Roman Catholic Church, although many of its past members appeared to have held membership of the small Reformed Churches of New Zealand, composed largely of conservative Calvinist Dutch immigrants. The party had long required its members to publicly declare themselves as Christians. Some commentators criticised this rigid confessional policy for supposedly limiting the party&#x27;s base.

== History ==

=== Founding ===

The Christian Heritage Party of Canada was part of the inspiration behind the formation of New Zealand&#x27;s Christian Heritage Party, and other influences also existed. Many of the party&#x27;s founding members had Dutch ancestry and familiarity with the history of the Anti-Revolutionary Party, which functioned as an influential political party in Netherlands governments between 1888 and 1980, and many of the party&#x27;s founding members belonged to the Reformed Churches of New Zealand.

Dirk Vanderpyl noted in his book &quot;Trust and Obey&quot; (1994) that many Reformed Churches of New Zealand members came from a narrow slice of Netherlands society, centred in Zeeland, Veluwe and Overijssel. In those Netherlands provinces, the Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij (SGP or Political Reformed Party in English) had existed since 1922, and stood as a model for separatist Reformed fundamentalist political activism. The SGP differs from the Christian Heritage Party in that it restricts its membership to certain Reformed denominations, while Christian Heritage membership stood open to all evangelical Christians, although at first many of its office-holders had some association with the Reformed Churches. However, the SGP has only ever existed as a &#x27;testimonial party&#x27;.

Also inspired by the Christian Heritage Party of Canada, the Christian Heritage Party of New Zealand emerged in 1989 to promote &quot;Biblical principles&quot; in politics, although the party&#x27;s leadership generally claimed that its policies advantaged even non-Christians. Bill van Rij founded the party and became its first President; John Allen, former National Party candidate for Heretaunga, became its initial leader.

=== 1990 election ===
The party&#x27;s first convention took place in 1990 and established the group&#x27;s structure. In 1991 the party confirmed Graham Capill, a Reformed Churches of New Zealand pastor, as its leader. During the 1990s, some non-Reformed evangelical Christians repeatedly complained that the CHP took too long to transcend this initial base.

Eighteen Christian Heritage candidates contested seats in the 1990 general election. The Party did not gain any seats, but did secure over 10,000 votes across the country. In 1992 the party&#x27;s candidate, Clive Thomson, finished fourth in a by-election in the electorate of Tamaki.

=== 1993 election ===
In the 1993 elections the Christian Heritage party stood 97 candidates and polled 2.02% of the overall vote, making it easily the largest party outside parliament, a position the party retained in the 1996, 1999 and 2002 general elections.

The Christian Heritage Party supported the ultimately successful campaign to change New Zealand&#x27;s electoral system from first-past-the-post to mixed-member proportional (MMP). (New Zealand endorsed MMP in 1993 and has used the system in general elections from 1996 onwards.)

=== Christian Coalition and the 1996 election ===
In 1994, the Christian Heritage Party gained new competition when National Party MP Graeme Lee formed the Christian Democrats (originally named the &quot;United Progressives&quot;). Lee had originally considered joining Christian Heritage, but eventually declined because of the party&#x27;s requirement that all members declare themselves Christians.

Later, however, Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats reached an agreement to contest the 1996 elections together. This resulted in the formation of the Christian Coalition, with Capill and Lee as its co-leaders. Lee held the first slot on the group&#x27;s &quot;party list&quot;, since he already had a seat in Parliament.

Shortly before the election, much speculation occurred as to whether the Christian Coalition would reach the &quot;five percent threshold&quot; necessary to gain proportional representation in New Zealand&#x27;s MMP electoral system. If the party gained more than five percent of the vote, it would gain entitlement to a share of parliamentary seats equivalent to its support, expected to amount to five or six MPs. Although the Coalition polled as high as 6.7% in polls before the election, in the final tally the Coalition won only 4.4% support.

=== 1997–1999 ===
In May 1997 the Christian Coalition collapsed, with the two component parties going their separate ways. Debate continues on the causes of this breakdown. According to the Christian Heritage Party, the Christian Democrats left the alliance; but other accounts disagree (either blaming Christian Heritage or blaming both). Points of contention included the extent to which the coalition would admit non-Christians who shared compatible views – after the split, the Christian Democrats would conceal the explicitly religious nature of their party, which they eventually renamed &quot;Future New Zealand&quot;.

Shortly afterwards, Bill van Rij left Christian Heritage and joined the Christian Democrats, blaming Capill for the collapse of the Coalition. A number of other senior Christian Heritage members, led by a former Deputy Leader, Geoff Hounsell, also resigned or suffered expulsion from the Party: they joined the Christian Democrats following their unsuccessful attempt to have Christian Heritage agree to a merger with the Christian Democrats.

Christian Heritage stood Ewen McQueen as its candidate in the 1998 Taranaki-King Country by-election. McQueen outpolled candidates for the larger New Zealand First and Green parties.

Six months before the 1999 elections, Frank Grover, leader of the Liberal Party, a component of the Alliance, defected to Christian Heritage, giving it one seat in Parliament. Grover had entered Parliament as an Alliance list MP. High-profile broadcaster Philip Sherry also joined the Christian Heritage Party in 1999 and stood in the number 2 position on the party list

=== 1999 election ===
In the 1999 general election, Christian Heritage gained 2.4% of the vote, well short of the 5% threshold for entering Parliament, although enough to make it easily the largest party outside parliament.

=== 2002 election ===
In the 2002 election, Christian Heritage had high hopes. It appointed Australian political consultant (now New South Wales assembly MP for the Liberal Party of Australia) David Elliott, who is a prominent campaigner against Republicanism in Australia, as its campaign-manager. Party strategists hoped that by focusing on a single electorate, Wairarapa, CHP could gain entry to Parliament and bypass the 5% threshold-requirement. However, the result proved disappointing to supporters – the party itself gained only 1.35% of the vote, and its Wairarapa candidate, deputy-leader Merepeka Raukawa-Tait, came third in the Wairarapa poll. Christian Heritage&#x27;s support defected to United Future New Zealand, a political party which had formed from the merger of Future New Zealand (a successor to the Christian Democrats) and Peter Dunne&#x27;s United New Zealand Party in 2000.

=== Aftermath of the 2002 election ===
In the aftermath of the 2002 election, considerable tension existed between the party&#x27;s central leadership and the Wairarapa branch. People alleged financial mismanagement against both sides, and Raukawa-Tait criticised Graham Capill&#x27;s leadership of the party. Capill, in turn, criticised Raukawa-Tait, and rebuked her for her comments. Raukawa-Tait and the entire Wairarapa Electorate Committee eventually resigned.

Not long after the 2002 election Capill announced his retirement as party leader and took up a job as a police prosecutor. When Capill&#x27;s retirement came into effect in August 2003, the Party appointed Ewen McQueen to replace him. The Party also re-affirmed its determination to carry on contesting elections (rather than remove itself from the list of parties and become a pressure-group). In 2003 the party adopted the name &quot;Christian Heritage New Zealand&quot;, or CHNZ, replacing the original &quot;Christian Heritage Party&quot;, or CHP.

In November 2004 Graham Capill resigned from the Party, citing differences of opinion about the Party&#x27;s direction such as the dropping of capital punishment.

=== Graham Capill sex scandal ===
In March 2005, newspapers reported that a &quot;prominent New Zealander&quot; was &quot;punched and left whimpering on the ground&quot; outside the Christchurch High Court, where he was defending sex charges. The papers could not name the man because of a court suppression-order. On 1 April 2005 the court lifted name-suppression and the press revealed the man as Graham Capill.

Capill admitted the indecent assault of an eight-year-old girl on four occasions in 2001 and 2002, while he led Christian Heritage. Further charges of rape and indecent assault against girls aged under 12 (committed during the 1990s) followed.

As Capill had strongly condemned &quot;sexual perversion&quot; throughout his political career, the charges had a strong impact both on Capill and on Christian Heritage, which swiftly condemned his conduct. Newspaper-reports described Capill as &quot;a sexual predator&quot;. Before sentencing, Capill emailed supporters asking that they pray for a light sentence and claiming the sex with one of the young girls as &quot;consensual&quot;.

=== 2005 election and aftermath ===
In the 2005 general elections, Christian Heritage saw its support collapse even further. The party stood only seven candidates, and only won 2,821 votes (out of more than 2 million cast) or 0.2 percent. It appears that much of its support bled over to National, United Future, and the newly formed Destiny New Zealand. The loss of support to Destiny proved somewhat surprising, since Destiny has its base in a Pentecostal organisation, the Destiny Church, and McQueen himself has Pentecostal affiliations.

A campaign organised by the conservative Christian-influenced Maxim Institute called &quot;New Zealand Votes 2005&quot; may have become a factor in the Party&#x27;s disappointing performance in the 2005 general election. The Maxim Institute portrayed the campaign as designed to inform voters. However, some commentators saw it as an ultimately successful attempt to persuade Christian voters not to vote for Christian Heritage New Zealand.

After the election, controversy arose when former CHNZ Policy Director Mark Munroe defended Capill in a private email, arguing that his serial paedophile offenses did not fit the &quot;biblical definition of rape&quot;. Ewen McQueen and the CHNZ Board pressured Munroe for his resignation, which ultimately occurred.

CHNZ detailed the party&#x27;s submission to Parliament&#x27;s Electoral Law Select committee in May 2006. The Party urged the reduction of MMP&#x27;s five per-cent threshold for list party representation without electorate seats, and abolition of MMP&#x27;s one seat/list representation rule, which allows parties that have an anchoring constituency seat to gain parliamentary representation without having to clear the five-percent threshold. Following a further review of MMP, the reduction of the 5% threshold to 4% and abolition of the one seat/list representation rule was recommended to parliament, which has to date not adopted the suggested changes.

=== Disbanding and legacy of the party ===
On 3 October 2006, the Party announced that it would close down following a postal vote in which 97% of its members endorsed the move. Party leader Ewen McQueen said shutting down would allow a new Christian party to form. He blamed Capill&#x27;s conviction and disgrace for the party&#x27;s demise.

The main legacy of the party is the adoption by New Zealand of the mixed-member proportional representation electoral system, which the party supported. In addition the party was a catalyst for the formation of other niche religious or conservative political parties in New Zealand such as the Christian Democrat Party.

Although the party has been disbanded, it has continued to appear sporadically in opinion polls as recently as April 2013.

<text>The Society of Christian Doctrine (, , ; abbreviated SDC), better known as MUSEUM, is a society of Catholic lay volunteers, made of men and women, teaching catechism in the Christian faith formation of children and adults. The society was established by George Preca in March 1907, in Malta. It has eventually spread around the world, first among Maltese migrants in Australia, then in Albania, in North Sudan, and other countries.

==Name==

&quot;MUSEUM&quot; is the abbreviation for &quot;Magister Utinam Sequatur Evangelium Universus Mundus&quot; as meaning &quot;Master, may the whole world follow the Gospel.&quot;

==Centres==

In Malta, the society has forty-six catechism centres for males and forty-three for females.

By 1961, the society spread in Gozo, and became successful after a visit for a fishing session. That same year catechism started for males, and in 1962 it was followed by the female branch. There are now nine catechism centres for males and seven for females in Gozo.

The objectives of the religious society is catechetical work in the parishes. Members may participate in the activities in six days every week. The society often organises recreational activities for minors and educational courses for adults.

Members of the society are invited to participate for a meeting every Wednesday at the &quot;mother-house&quot; of the society, in Blata l-Bajda, Marsa. The mother-house is the prominent Church of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal. The main scope for teaching catechism is to religiously prepare individuals, generally minors, to receive the sacraments according to the Roman Catholic tradition.

==Superiors General==

This is a list of former and present superiors general of the society:

* Eugenio Borg (1911–1967);
* Francesco Saliba (1967–1983);
* Victor Delicata (1983–2009);
* Natalino Camilleri (2009–2021) and
* Roberto Zammit (2021–present)

<text>The Pantheon (, ; , ) is an ancient 2nd century Roman temple and, since AD 609, a Catholic church ( or Basilica of St. Mary and the Martyrs) in Rome, Italy. It is perhaps the most famous, and architecturally most influential, rotunda. 

The Pantheon was built on the site of an earlier temple, which had been commissioned by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa during the reign of Augustus (27 BC – AD 14). After the original burnt down, the present building was ordered by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated  AD 126. Its date of construction is uncertain, because Hadrian chose to re-inscribe the new temple with Agrippa&#x27;s original date inscription from the older temple.

The building is round in plan, except for the portico with large granite Corinthian columns (eight in the first rank and two groups of four behind) under a pediment. A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda, which is under a coffered concrete dome, with a central opening (oculus) to the sky. Almost two thousand years after it was built, the Pantheon&#x27;s dome is still the world&#x27;s largest unreinforced concrete dome. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, .

It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings, in large part because it has been in continuous use throughout its history. Since the 7th century, it has been a church dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs (), known as &quot;Santa Maria Rotonda&quot;. The square in front of the Pantheon is called Piazza della Rotonda. The Pantheon is a state property, managed by Italy&#x27;s Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism through the Polo Museale del Lazio. In 2013, it was visited by over six million people.

The Pantheon&#x27;s large circular domed cella, with a conventional temple portico front, was unique in Roman architecture. Nevertheless, it became a standard exemplar when classical styles were revived, and has been copied many times by later architects.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Pantheon&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;Pantheion&quot; (Πάνθειον) meaning &quot;of, relating to, or common to all the gods&quot;: (pan- / &quot;παν-&quot; meaning &quot;all&quot; + theion / &quot;θεῖον&quot;= meaning &quot;of or sacred to a god&quot;). The simplest explanation for the name is that the Pantheon was a temple dedicated to all the gods. However, the concept of a temple dedicated to all the gods has been questioned. Ziegler tried to collect evidence of pantheons, but his list consists of simple dedications &quot;to all the gods&quot; or &quot;to the Twelve Gods&quot;, which are not necessarily true pantheons in the sense of a temple housing a cult that literally worships all the gods. The only definite pantheon recorded earlier than Agrippa&#x27;s was at Antioch in Syria, though it is only mentioned by a sixth-century source. Cassius Dio, a Roman senator who wrote in Greek, speculated that the name of the Pantheon comes either from the statues of many gods placed around this building, or from the resemblance of the dome to the heavens. According to Adam Ziolkowski, this uncertainty strongly suggests that &quot;Pantheon&quot; (or Pantheum) was merely a nickname, not the formal name of the building.

Godfrey and Hemsoll point out that ancient authors never refer to Hadrian&#x27;s Pantheon with the word &quot;&quot;, as they do with other temples, and the Severan inscription carved on the architrave uses simply &quot;Pantheum&quot;, not &quot;Aedes Panthei&quot; (temple of all the gods). Livy wrote that it had been decreed that temple buildings (or perhaps temple cellae) should only be dedicated to single divinities, so that it would be clear who would be offended if, for example, the building was struck by lightning, and because it was only appropriate to offer sacrifice to a specific deity (27.25.7–10). Godfrey and Hemsoll maintain that the word Pantheon &quot;need not denote a particular group of gods, or, indeed, even all the gods, since it could well have had other meanings. ... Certainly the word pantheus or pantheos, could be applicable to individual deities. ... Bearing in mind also that the Greek word θεῖος (theios) need not mean &#x27;of a god&#x27; but could mean &#x27;superhuman&#x27;, or even &#x27;excellent&#x27;.&quot;

Since the French Revolution, when the church of Sainte-Geneviève in Paris was deconsecrated and turned into the secular monument called the Panthéon of Paris, the generic term &quot;pantheon&quot; has sometimes been applied to other buildings in which illustrious dead are honoured or buried.

==History==
===Ancient===
In the aftermath of the Battle of Actium (31 BC), Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa started an impressive building program. The Pantheon was a part of the complex created by him on his own property in the Campus Martius in 29–19 BC, which included three buildings aligned from south to north: the Baths of Agrippa, the Basilica of Neptune, and the Pantheon. It seems likely that the Pantheon and the Basilica of Neptune were Agrippa&#x27;s &quot;sacra privata&quot;, not &quot;aedes publicae&quot; (public temples). The former would help explain how the building could have so easily lost its original name and purpose (Ziolkowski contends that it was originally the Temple of Mars in Campo) in such a relatively short period of time.

It had long been thought that the current building was built by Agrippa, with later alterations undertaken, and this was in part because of the Latin inscription on the front of the temple which reads:
:M·AGRIPPA·L·F·COS·TERTIVM·FECIT
or in full, &quot;&quot;M[arcus] Agrippa L[ucii] f[ilius] co[n]s[ul] tertium fecit&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, made [this building] when consul for the third time.&quot; However, archaeological excavations have shown that the Pantheon of Agrippa had been completely destroyed except for the façade. Lise Hetland argues that the present construction began in 114, under Trajan, four years after it was destroyed by fire for the second time (Oros. 7.12). She reexamined Herbert Bloch&#x27;s 1959 paper, which is responsible for the commonly maintained Hadrianic date, and maintains that he should not have excluded all of the Trajanic-era bricks from his brick-stamp study. Her argument is particularly interesting in light of Heilmeyer&#x27;s argument that, based on stylistic evidence, Apollodorus of Damascus, Trajan&#x27;s architect, was the obvious architect.
The form of Agrippa&#x27;s Pantheon is debated. As a result of excavations in the late 19th century, archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani concluded that Agrippa&#x27;s Pantheon was oriented so that it faced south, in contrast with the current layout that faces north, and that it had a shortened T-shaped plan with the entrance at the base of the &quot;T&quot;. This description was widely accepted until the late 20th century. While more recent archaeological diggings have suggested that Agrippa&#x27;s building might have had a circular form with a triangular porch, and it might have also faced north, much like the later rebuildings, Ziolkowski complains that their conclusions were based entirely on surmise; according to him, they did not find any new datable material, yet they attributed everything they found to the Agrippan phase, failing to account for the fact that Domitian, known for his enthusiasm for building and known to have restored the Pantheon after 80 AD, might well have been responsible for everything they found. Ziolkowski argues that Lanciani&#x27;s initial assessment is still supported by all of the finds to date, including theirs; he expresses scepticism because the building they describe, &quot;a single building composed of a huge pronaos and a circular cella of the same diameter, linked by a relatively narrow and very short passage (much thinner than the current intermediate block), has no known parallels in classical architecture and would go against everything we know of Roman design principles in general and of Augustan architecture in particular.&quot;

The only passages referring to the decoration of the Agrippan Pantheon written by an eyewitness are in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;. From him we know that &quot;the capitals, too, of the pillars, which were placed by M. Agrippa in the Pantheon, are made of Syracusan bronze&quot;, that &quot;the Pantheon of Agrippa has been decorated by Diogenes of Athens, and the Caryatides, by him, which form the columns of that temple, are looked upon as masterpieces of excellence: the same, too, with the statues that are placed upon the roof,&quot; and that one of Cleopatra&#x27;s pearls was cut in half so that each half &quot;might serve as pendants for the ears of Venus, in the Pantheon at Rome&quot;.

The Augustan Pantheon was destroyed along with other buildings in a fire in 80 AD. Domitian rebuilt the Pantheon, which was burnt again in 110 AD.

The degree to which the decorative scheme should be credited to Hadrian&#x27;s architects is uncertain. Finished by Hadrian but not claimed as one of his works, it used the text of the original inscription on the new façade (a common practice in Hadrian&#x27;s rebuilding projects all over Rome; the only building on which Hadrian put his own name was the Temple to the Deified Trajan). How the building was actually used is not known. The Historia Augusta says that Hadrian dedicated the Pantheon (among other buildings) in the name of the original builder (Hadr. 19.10), but the current inscription could not be a copy of the original; it does not tell us to whom Agrippa&#x27;s foundation was dedicated, and, in Ziolkowski&#x27;s opinion, it was highly unlikely that in 25 BC Agrippa would have presented himself as &quot;consul tertium.&quot; On coins, the same words, &quot;M. Agrippa L.f cos. tertium&quot;, were the ones used to refer to him after his death; consul tertium serving as &quot;a sort of posthumous cognomen ex virtute, a remembrance of the fact that, of all the men of his generation apart from Augustus himself, he was the only one to hold the consulship thrice.&quot; Whatever the cause of the alteration of the inscription might have been, the new inscription reflects the fact that there was a change in the building&#x27;s purpose.

Cassius Dio, a Graeco-Roman senator, consul and author of a comprehensive &quot;History of Rome&quot;, writing approximately 75 years after the Pantheon&#x27;s reconstruction, mistakenly attributed the domed building to Agrippa rather than Hadrian. Dio appears to be the only near-contemporaneous writer to mention the Pantheon. Even by 200, there was uncertainty about the origin of the building and its purpose:

In 202, the building was repaired by the joint emperors Septimius Severus and his son Caracalla (fully &quot;Marcus Aurelius Antoninus&quot;), for which there is another, smaller inscription on the architrave of the façade, under the aforementioned larger text. This now-barely legible inscription reads:

:IMP · CAES · L · SEPTIMIVS · SEVERVS · PIVS · PERTINAX · ARABICVS · ADIABENICVS · PARTHICVS · MAXIMVS · PONTIF · MAX · TRIB · POTEST · X · IMP · XI · COS · III · P · P · PROCOS  ET
:IMP · CAES · M · AVRELIVS · ANTONINVS · PIVS · FELIX · AVG · TRIB · POTEST · V · COS · PROCOS · PANTHEVM · VETVSTATE · CORRVPTVM · CVM · OMNI · CVLTV · RESTITVERVNT

In English, this means:
:Emp[eror] Caes[ar] L[ucius] Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax, victorious in Arabia, victor of Adiabene, the greatest victor in Parthia, Pontif[ex] Max[imus], 10 times tribune, 11 times proclaimed emperor, three times consul, P[ater] P[atriae], proconsul, and
:Emp[eror] Caes[ar] M[arcus] Aurelius Antoninus Pius Felix Aug[ustus], five times tribune, consul, proconsul, have carefully restored the Pantheon ruined by age.

===Medieval===

In 609, the Byzantine emperor Phocas gave the building to Pope Boniface IV, who converted it into a Christian church and consecrated it to St. Mary and the Martyrs on 13 May 609: &quot;Another Pope, Boniface, asked the same [Emperor Phocas, in Constantinople] to order that in the old temple called the Pantheon, after the pagan filth was removed, a church should be made, to the holy virgin Mary and all the martyrs, so that the commemoration of the saints would take place henceforth where not gods but demons were formerly worshipped.&quot; Twenty-eight cartloads of holy relics of martyrs were said to have been removed from the catacombs and placed in a porphyry basin beneath the high altar. On its consecration, Boniface placed an icon of the Mother of God as &#x27;Panagia Hodegetria&#x27; (All Holy Directress) within the new sanctuary.

The building&#x27;s consecration as a church saved it from the abandonment, destruction, and the worst of the spoliation that befell the majority of ancient Rome&#x27;s buildings during the Early Middle Ages. However, Paul the Deacon records the spoliation of the building by the Emperor Constans II, who visited Rome in July 663:
Remaining at Rome twelve days he pulled down everything that in ancient times had been made of metal for the ornament of the city, to such an extent that he even stripped off the roof of the church [of the blessed Mary], which at one time was called the Pantheon, and had been founded in honour of all the gods and was now by the consent of the former rulers the place of all the martyrs; and he took away from there the bronze tiles and sent them with all the other ornaments to Constantinople.

Much fine external marble has been removed over the centuries – for example, capitals from some of the pilasters are in the British Museum. Two columns were swallowed up in the medieval buildings that abutted the Pantheon on the east and were lost. In the early 17th century, Urban VIII Barberini tore away the bronze ceiling of the portico, and replaced the medieval campanile with the famous twin towers (often wrongly attributed to Bernini) called &quot;the ass&#x27;s ears&quot;, which were not removed until the late 19th century. The only other loss has been the external sculptures, which adorned the pediment above Agrippa&#x27;s inscription. The marble interior has largely survived, although with extensive restoration.

===Renaissance===
Since the Renaissance the Pantheon has been the site of several important burials. Among those buried there are the painters Raphael and Annibale Carracci, the composer Arcangelo Corelli, and the architect Baldassare Peruzzi. In the 15th century, the Pantheon was adorned with paintings: the best-known is the &quot;Annunciation&quot; by Melozzo da Forlì. Filippo Brunelleschi, among other architects, looked to the Pantheon as inspiration for their works.

Pope Urban VIII (1623 to 1644) ordered the bronze ceiling of the Pantheon&#x27;s portico melted down. Most of the bronze was used to make bombards for the fortification of Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, with the rest used by the Apostolic Camera for other works. It is also said that the bronze was used by Bernini in creating his famous baldachin above the high altar of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, though the archaeologist Carlo Fea discovered from the Pope&#x27;s accounts that about 90% of the bronze was used for the cannon, and that the bronze for the baldachin came from Venice. Concerning this, an anonymous contemporary Roman satirist quipped in a pasquinade (a publicly posted poem) that &quot;quod non fecerunt barbari fecerunt Barberini&quot; (&quot;What the barbarians did not do the Barberinis [Urban VIII&#x27;s family name] did&quot;).

In 1747, the broad frieze below the dome with its false windows was &quot;restored,&quot; but bore little resemblance to the original. In the early decades of the 20th century, a piece of the original, as far as could be reconstructed from Renaissance drawings and paintings, was recreated in one of the panels.

===Modern===
Two kings of Italy are buried in the Pantheon: Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I, as well as Umberto&#x27;s Queen, Margherita. It was supposed to be the final resting place for the Monarchs of Italy of the House of Savoy, but the Monarchy was abolished in 1946 and the authorities have refused to grant burial to the former kings who died in exile (Victor Emmanuel III and Umberto II). The National Institute for the Honour Guard of the Royal Tombs of the Pantheon was originally chartered by the House of Savoy and subsequently operating with authorization of the Italian Republic, mounts as guards of honour in front of the royal tombs.

The Pantheon is in use as a Catholic church, and as such, visitors are asked to keep an appropriate level of deference. Masses are celebrated there on Sundays and holy days of obligation. Weddings are also held there from time to time.

==Structure==

===Portico===
The building was originally approached by a flight of steps. Later construction raised the level of the ground leading to the portico, eliminating these steps.

The pediment was decorated with relief sculpture, probably of gilded bronze. Holes marking the location of clamps that held the sculpture suggest that its design was likely an eagle within a wreath; ribbons extended from the wreath into the corners of the pediment.

On the intermediate block between the portico and the rotunda, the remains of a second pediment suggests that the existing portico is much shorter than originally intended. A portico aligned with the second pediment would fit columns with shafts 50 Roman feet (14.8 metres) tall and capitals 10 Roman feet tall (3 metres), whereas the existing portico has shafts 40 Roman feet (11.9 metres) tall and capitals eight Roman feet (2.4 metres) tall.

Mark Wilson Jones has attempted to explain the design adjustments by suggesting that, once the higher pediment had been constructed, the required 50-foot columns failed to arrive (possibly as a result of logistical difficulties). The builders then had to make some awkward adjustments to fit the shorter columns and pediments. Rabun Taylor has noted that, even if the taller columns were delivered, basic construction constraints may have prevented their use. Assuming that each column would first be laid on the floor next to its pediment before being pivoted upright (using something like an A-frame), there would be a space requirement of a column-length on one side of the pediment, and at least a column-length on the opposite side for the pivoting equipment and ropes. With 50-foot columns, &quot;there was no way to sequence the erection of [the columns] without creating a hopeless snarl. The shafts were simply too long to be positioned on the floor in a workable configuration, regardless of sequence.&quot; Specifically, the innermost row of columns would be blocked by the main body of the temple, and in the later stages of construction some already-erected columns would inevitably obstruct the erection of further columns.

It has also been argued that the scale of the portico was related to the urban design of the space in front of the temple.

The grey granite columns that were used in the Pantheon&#x27;s pronaos were quarried in Egypt at Mons Claudianus in the eastern mountains. Each was tall, in diameter, and in weight. These were dragged more than from the quarry to the river on wooden sledges. They were floated by barge down the Nile when the water level was high during the spring floods, and then transferred to vessels to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the Roman port of Ostia. There, they were transferred back onto barges and pulled up the Tiber River to Rome. After being unloaded near the Mausoleum of Augustus, the site of the Pantheon was still about 700 metres away. Thus, it was necessary to either drag them or to move them on rollers to the construction site.

In the walls at the back of the Pantheon&#x27;s portico are two huge niches, perhaps intended for statues of Augustus Caesar and Agrippa.

The large bronze doors to the cella, measuring wide by high, are the oldest in Rome. These were thought to be a 15th-century replacement for the original, mainly because they were deemed by contemporary architects to be too small for the door frames. Later analysis of the fusion technique confirmed that these are the original Roman doors, a rare example of Roman monumental bronze surviving, despite cleaning and the application of Christian motifs over the centuries.

===Rotunda===

The weight of the Roman concrete dome is concentrated on a ring of voussoirs in diameter that form the oculus, while the downward thrust of the dome is carried by eight barrel vaults in the drum wall into eight piers. The thickness of the dome varies from at the base of the dome to around the oculus. The materials used in the concrete of the dome also vary. At its thickest point, the aggregate is travertine, then terracotta tiles, then at the very top, tufa and pumice, both porous light stones. At the very top, where the dome would be at its weakest and vulnerable to collapse, the oculus lightens the load.
No tensile test results are available on the concrete used in the Pantheon; however, Cowan discussed tests on ancient concrete from Roman ruins in Libya, which gave a compressive strength of . An empirical relationship gives a tensile strength of for this specimen. Finite element analysis of the structure by Mark and Hutchison found a maximum tensile stress of only at the point where the dome joins the raised outer wall.

The stresses in the dome were found to be substantially reduced by the use of successively less dense aggregate stones, such as small pots or pieces of pumice, in higher layers of the dome. Mark and Hutchison estimated that, if normal weight concrete had been used throughout, the stresses in the arch would have been some 80% greater. Hidden chambers engineered within the rotunda form a sophisticated structural system. This reduced the weight of the roof, as did the oculus eliminating the apex.

The top of the rotunda wall features a series of brick relieving arches, visible on the outside and built into the mass of the brickwork. The Pantheon is full of such devices – for example, there are relieving arches over the recesses inside – but all these arches were hidden by marble facing on the interior and possibly by stone revetment or stucco on the exterior.

The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, , so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube (or, a 43.3-m sphere could fit within the interior). These dimensions make more sense when expressed in ancient Roman units of measurement: The dome spans 150 Roman feet; the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high. The Pantheon still holds the record for the world&#x27;s largest unreinforced concrete dome. It is also substantially larger than earlier domes. It is the only masonry dome to not require reinforcement. All other extant ancient domes were either designed with tie-rods, chains and banding or have been retrofitted with such devices to prevent collapse.

Though often drawn as a free-standing building, there was a building at its rear which abutted it. While this building helped buttress the rotunda, there was no interior passage from one to the other.

===Interior===
Upon entry, visitors are greeted by an enormous rounded room covered by the dome. The oculus at the top of the dome was never covered, allowing rainfall through the ceiling and onto the floor. Because of this, the interior floor is equipped with drains and has been built with an incline of about to promote water runoff.

The interior of the dome was possibly intended to symbolize the arched vault of the heavens. The oculus at the dome&#x27;s apex and the entry door are the only natural sources of light in the interior. Throughout the day, light from the oculus moves around this space in a reverse sundial effect: marking time with light rather than shadow. The oculus also offers cooling and ventilation; during storms, a drainage system below the floor handles rain falling through the oculus. On Pentecost, huge quantities of red rose petals are thrown through the oculus by firefighters of the Vigili del Fuoco on the roof.

The dome features sunken panels (coffers), in five rings of 28. This evenly spaced layout was difficult to achieve and, it is presumed, had symbolic meaning, either numerical, geometric, or lunar. In antiquity, the coffers may have contained bronze rosettes symbolising the starry firmament.

Circles and squares form the unifying theme of the interior design. The checkerboard floor pattern contrasts with the concentric circles of square coffers in the dome. Each zone of the interior, from floor to ceiling, is subdivided according to a different scheme. As a result, the interior decorative zones do not line up. The overall effect is immediate viewer orientation according to the major axis of the building, even though the cylindrical space topped by a hemispherical dome is inherently ambiguous. This discordance has not always been appreciated, and the attic level was redone according to Neoclassical taste in the 18th century.

The present high altars and the apses were commissioned by Pope Clement XI (1700–1721) and designed by Alessandro Specchi. Enshrined on the apse above the high altar is a 7th-century Byzantine icon of the Virgin and Child, given by Phocas to Pope Boniface IV on the occasion of the dedication of the Pantheon for Christian worship on 13 May 609. The choir was added in 1840, and was designed by Luigi Poletti.

The first niche to the right of the entrance holds a &quot;Madonna of the Girdle and St Nicholas of Bari&quot; (1686) painted by an unknown artist. The first chapel on the right, the Chapel of the Annunciation, has a fresco of the &quot;Annunciation&quot; attributed to Melozzo da Forlì. On the left side is a canvas by Clement Maioli of &quot;St Lawrence and St Agnes&quot; (1645–1650). On the right wall is the &quot;Incredulity of St Thomas&quot; (1633) by Pietro Paolo Bonzi.

The second niche has a 15th-century fresco of the Tuscan school, depicting the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot;. In the second chapel is the tomb of King Victor Emmanuel II (died 1878). It was originally dedicated to the Holy Spirit. A competition was held to decide which architect should design it. Giuseppe Sacconi participated, but lost – he would later design the tomb of Umberto I in the opposite chapel.

Manfredo Manfredi won the competition, and started work in 1885. The tomb consists of a large bronze plaque surmounted by a Roman eagle and the arms of the house of Savoy. The golden lamp above the tomb burns in honor of Victor Emmanuel III, who died in exile in 1947.

The third niche has a sculpture by Il Lorenzone of &quot;St Anne and the Blessed Virgin&quot;. In the third chapel is a 15th-century painting of the Umbrian school, &quot;The Madonna of Mercy between St Francis and St John the Baptist&quot;. It is also known as the Madonna of the Railing, because it originally hung in the niche on the left-hand side of the portico, where it was protected by a railing. It was moved to the &quot;Chapel of the Annunciation&quot;, and then to its present position sometime after 1837. The bronze epigram commemorated Pope Clement XI&#x27;s restoration of the sanctuary. On the right wall is the canvas &quot;Emperor Phocas presenting the Pantheon to Pope Boniface IV&quot; (1750) by an unknown. There are three memorial plaques in the floor, one conmmemorating a Gismonda written in the vernacular. The final niche on the right side has a statue of &quot;St. Anastasius&quot; (&quot;Sant&#x27;Anastasio&quot;) (1725) by Bernardino Cametti.

On the first niche to the left of the entrance is an &quot;Assumption&quot; (1638) by Andrea Camassei. The first chapel on the left, the Chapel of St Joseph in the Holy Land, is the chapel of the Confraternity of the , a confraternity of artists and musicians formed by a 16th-century canon, Desiderio da Segni, to ensure that worship was maintained in the chapel.

The first members were, among others, Antonio da Sangallo the younger, Jacopo Meneghino, Giovanni Mangone, Zuccari, Domenico Beccafumi, and Flaminio Vacca. The confraternity continued to draw members from the elite of Rome&#x27;s artists and architects, and among later members we find Bernini, Cortona, Algardi, and many others. The institution still exists, and is now called the &quot;Academia Ponteficia di Belle Arti&quot; (The Pontifical Academy of Fine Arts), based in the palace of the Cancelleria. The altar in the chapel is covered with false marble. On the altar is a statue of &quot;St Joseph and the Holy Child&quot; by Vincenzo de&#x27; Rossi.

To the sides are paintings (1661) by Francesco Cozza, one of the Virtuosi: &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; on left side and &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; on right. The stucco relief on the left, &quot;Dream of St Joseph&quot;, is by Paolo Benaglia, and the one on the right, &quot;Rest during the flight from Egypt&quot;, is by Carlo Monaldi. On the vault are several 17th-century canvases, from left to right: &quot;Cumean Sibyl&quot; by Ludovico Gimignani; Moses by Francesco Rosa; &quot;Eternal Father&quot; by Giovanni Peruzzini; &quot;David&quot; by Luigi Garzi; and &quot;Eritrean Sibyl&quot; by Giovanni Andrea Carlone.

The second niche has a statue of &quot;St Agnes&quot;, by Vincenzo Felici. The bust on the left is a portrait of Baldassare Peruzzi, derived from a plaster portrait by Giovanni Duprè. The tomb of King Umberto I and his wife Margherita di Savoia is in the next chapel. The chapel was originally dedicated to St Michael the Archangel, and then to St. Thomas the Apostle. The present design is by Giuseppe Sacconi, completed after his death by his pupil Guido Cirilli. The tomb consists of a slab of alabaster mounted in gilded bronze. The frieze has allegorical representations of &quot;Generosity&quot;, by Eugenio Maccagnani, and &quot;Munificence&quot;, by Arnaldo Zocchi. The royal tombs are maintained by the National Institute of Honour Guards to the Royal Tombs, founded in 1878. They also organize picket guards at the tombs. The altar with the royal arms is by Cirilli.

The third niche holds the mortal remains – his Ossa et cineres, &quot;Bones and ashes&quot;, as the inscription on the sarcophagus says – of the great artist Raphael. His fiancée, Maria Bibbiena is buried to the right of his sarcophagus; she died before they could marry. The sarcophagus was given by Pope Gregory XVI, and its inscription reads &quot;ILLE HIC EST RAPHAEL TIMUIT QUO SOSPITE VINCI / RERUM MAGNA PARENS ET MORIENTE MORI&quot;, meaning &quot;Here lies Raphael, by whom the great mother of all things (Nature) feared to be overcome while he was living, and while he was dying, herself to die&quot;. The epigraph was written by Pietro Bembo.

The present arrangement is from 1811, designed by Antonio Muñoz. The bust of Raphael (1833) is by Giuseppe Fabris. The two plaques commemorate Maria Bibbiena and Annibale Carracci. Behind the tomb is the statue known as the &quot;Madonna del Sasso&quot; (Madonna of the Rock) so named because she rests one foot on a boulder. It was commissioned by Raphael and made by Lorenzetto in 1524.

In the Chapel of the Crucifixion, the Roman brick wall is visible in the niches. The wooden crucifix on the altar is from the 15th century. On the left wall is a &quot;Descent of the Holy Ghost&quot; (1790) by Pietro Labruzi. On the right side is the low relief &quot;Cardinal Consalvi presents to Pope Pius VII the five provinces restored to the Holy See&quot; (1824) made by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. The bust is a portrait of Cardinal Agostino Rivarola. The final niche on this side has a statue of &quot;St. Evasius&quot; (&quot;Sant&#x27;Evasio&quot;) (1727) by Francesco Moderati.

== Cardinal deaconry ==
On 23 July 1725, the Pantheon was established as Cardinal-deaconry of S. Maria ad Martyres, i.e. a titular church for a cardinal-deacon. On 26 May 1929, this deaconry was suppressed to establish the Cardinal Deaconry of S. Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane-Alessandrine.

==Influence==

As the best-preserved example of an Ancient Roman monumental building, the Pantheon has been enormously influential in Western architecture from at least the Renaissance on; starting with Brunelleschi&#x27;s dome of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, completed in 1436.

Among the most notable versions are the church of Santa Maria Assunta (1664) in Ariccia by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, which followed his work restoring the Roman original, Belle Isle House (1774) in England and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s library at the University of Virginia, The Rotunda (1817–1826). Others include the Rotunda of Mosta in Malta (1833). The architect Carl Ludvig Engel also took influences from the structure of the Pantheon for the Nokia Church (1837). Other notable replicas, such as The Rotunda (New York) (1818), have not survived.

The portico-and-dome form of the Pantheon can be detected in many buildings of the 19th and 20th centuries; numerous government and public buildings, city halls, university buildings, and public libraries echo its structure. The 1824 Henriette Wegner Pavilion in Oslo&#x27;s famous Frogner Park features a painted miniature copy of the Pantheon dome. The Pantheon&#x27;s dome was an inspiration for the , an assembly hall planned but never built by the Nazi German architect Albert Speer for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s intended rebuilding of Berlin as &quot;Germania&quot;.

<text>In baseball, an unassisted triple play occurs when a defensive player makes all three outs by himself in one continuous play, without his teammates making any assists. Neal Ball was the first to achieve this in Major League Baseball (MLB) under modern rules, doing so on July 19, 1909. For this rare play to be possible there must be no outs in the inning and at least two runners on base, normally with the runners going on the pitch (e.g., double steal or hit-and-run). An unassisted triple play usually consists of a hard line drive hit directly at an infielder for the first out, with that same fielder then able to double off one of the base runners and tag a second for the second and third outs.

In MLB, a total of fifteen players have fielded an unassisted triple play, making this feat rarer than a perfect game. Of these fifteen players, eight were shortstops, five were second basemen and two were first basemen. The Cleveland Naps / Cleveland Indians / Cleveland Guardians are the only franchise to have three players achieve the feat while on their roster: Neal Ball, Bill Wambsganss and Asdrúbal Cabrera. The shortest time between two unassisted triple plays occurred in May 1927, when Johnny Neun executed the feat less than 24 hours after Jimmy Cooney. Conversely, it took more than 41 seasons after Neun&#x27;s play before Ron Hansen performed the feat on July 30, 1968, marking the longest span between unassisted triple plays. The most recent player to make an unassisted triple play is Eric Bruntlett, accomplishing the feat on August 23, 2009. Only Neun and Bruntlett executed unassisted triple plays that ended the game.

==Background==

Most unassisted triple plays in MLB have taken this form: an infielder catches a line drive (one out), steps on second base to double off a runner (two outs), and then tags another runner on the runner&#x27;s way to the next base (three outs). In general, the &quot;next base&quot; is usually second base, and the last runner is tagged before he can return to first base. Infrequently, the order of the last two putouts is reversed.

It is nearly impossible for an unassisted triple play to occur unless the fielder is positioned between the two runners. For this reason, all but two of these plays have been accomplished by middle infielders (second basemen and shortstops). The other two were completed by first basemen, who were able to reach second base before the returning baserunner. For example, after collecting the first two outs, Tigers&#x27; first baseman Johnny Neun ignored his shortstop&#x27;s shouts to throw the ball, and instead ran to second base to get the final out himself. The only unassisted triple play that did not take one of these forms occurred in the 19th century, under rules that are no longer in effect (see below).

It is plausible that a third baseman could complete an unassisted triple play with runners at second and third or with bases loaded, but this has never happened in MLB. Players in other positions (pitcher, catcher, outfielders) completing an unassisted triple play would require unusual confusion or mistakes by the baserunners, or an atypical defensive alignment (for example, repositioning an outfielder as a fifth infielder).

The unassisted triple play, the perfect game, hitting four home runs in one game and five extra-base hits in a game are thus comparable in terms of rarity, but the perfect game and the home run and extra-base hit records require an extraordinary effort along with a fair amount of luck. By contrast, the unassisted triple play is essentially always a matter of luck: a combination of the right circumstances with the relatively simple effort of catching the ball and running in the proper direction with it. Troy Tulowitzki said of his feat, &quot;It fell right in my lap&quot;, and as WGN-TV sports anchor Dan Roan commented, &quot;That&#x27;s the way these plays always happen.&quot;

==Instances==

===19th century===

*Paul Hines, May 8, 1878, Providence Grays (vs. Boston Red Caps) (disputed)
**With runners on second and third, center fielder Hines caught a line drive from Jack Burdock that the runners thought was uncatchable. When he caught it, both runners had already passed third (according to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; account of the game, printed on May 9). Hines stepped on third, which by the rules of the day meant both runners were out. To make sure, he threw the ball to Charlie Sweasy at second base. It is still debated whether this was truly an unassisted triple play. Modern rules would have required either the ball to be conveyed to second base to put out the runner who had been on that base and had not tagged up, or that runner to be tagged. According to the Society for American Baseball Research, the runner coming from second, Ezra Sutton, had not yet touched third base, which would mean that even by 19th-century rules the play was not complete until Hines threw to second, and thus the play was not unassisted. Ernest J. Lanigan&#x27;s &quot;Baseball Cyclopedia&quot;, 1922, which covers professional baseball back to 1876, states on p. 157 that Neal Ball in 1909 was &quot;the first major leaguer to make an unassisted triple play&quot;. &quot;The Sporting News Baseball Record Book&quot;, which covers records back to 1876, likewise does not list Hines&#x27; play in the section on unassisted triple plays.

===Modern era (in MLB)===

This was while Nebuchadnezzar II was commander-in-chief and Nabopolassar was still king of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar became king a few weeks after this battle.

==Background==
When the Assyrian capital, Nineveh, was overrun by the Medes, Scythians, Babylonians and their allies in 612 BC, the Assyrians moved their capital to Harran. When Harran was captured by the alliance in 609 BC, ending the Assyrian Empire, remnants of the Assyrian army joined Carchemish, a city under Egyptian rule, on the Euphrates. Egypt, a former vassal of Assyria, was allied with Assyrian King Ashur-uballit II and marched in 609 BC to his aid against the Babylonians.

The Egyptian army of Pharaoh Necho II was delayed at Megiddo by the forces of King Josiah of Judah. Josiah was killed, and his army was defeated at the Battle of Megiddo.

The Egyptians and the Assyrians together crossed the Euphrates and laid siege to Harran, which they failed to retake. They then retreated to northwestern Assyria in what is now northeastern Syria.

==Battle==
The Egyptians met the full might of the Babylonian and Median army led by Nebuchadnezzar II at Carchemish, where the combined Egyptian and Assyrian forces were destroyed. Assyria ceased to exist as an independent power, and Egypt retreated and was no longer a significant force in the Ancient Near East. Babylonia reached its economic peak after 605 BC.

==Records==
The Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle, now housed in the British Museum, claims that Nebuchadnezzar &quot;crossed the river to go against the Egyptian army which lay in Karchemiš. They fought with each other and the Egyptian army withdrew before him. He accomplished their defeat, decisively. As for the rest of the Egyptian army which had escaped from the defeat so quickly that no weapon had reached them, in the district of Hamath, the Babylonian troops overtook and defeated them so that not a single man escaped to his own country. At that time, Nebuchadnezzar conquered the whole area of Hamath.&quot;

The battle is also mentioned and described in the Bible, in the Book of Jeremiah.

== Discrepancy ==
While historians typically take Necho II to have been fighting in support of the remaining Assyrian forces, according to Flavius Josephus, in his account, &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; Necho entered the battle to take advantage of the power vacuum created by the Assyrian forces&#x27; defeat.

<text>Queen&#x27;s House is a former royal residence in the London borough of Greenwich, which presently serves as a public art gallery. It was built between 1616 and 1635 on the grounds of the now demolished Greenwich Palace, a few miles downriver from the City of London. In its current setting, it forms a central focus of the Old Royal Naval College with a grand vista leading to the River Thames, a World Heritage Site called, Maritime Greenwich. The Queen&#x27;s House architect, Inigo Jones, was commissioned by Queen Anne of Denmark in 1616 and again to finish the house in 1635 by Queen Henrietta Maria. The House was commissioned by both Anne and Henrietta as a retreat and place to display and enjoy the artworks they had accumulated and commissioned; this includes a ceiling of the Great Hall that features a work by Orazio Gentileschi titled &quot;Allegory of Peace and the Arts.&quot;

Queen&#x27;s House is one of the most important buildings in British architectural history, due to it being the first consciously classical building to have been constructed in the country. It was Jones&#x27;s first major commission after returning from his 1613–1615 grand tour of Roman, Renaissance, and Palladian architecture in Italy. Some earlier English buildings, such as Longleat and Burghley House, had made borrowings from the classical style, but the structure of these buildings was not informed by an understanding of classical precedents. Queen&#x27;s House would have appeared revolutionary during this period. Although it diverges from the mathematical constraints of Palladio, Jones is often credited with the introduction of Palladianism with the construction of the Queen&#x27;s House. Jones&#x27; unique architecture of the Queen&#x27;s House also includes features like the Tulip Stairs, an intricate wrought iron staircase that holds itself up, and the Great Hall, a perfect cube.

After its brief use as a home for Royalty, the Queen&#x27;s House was incorporated into use for the complex for the expanding Royal Hospital for Seamen. Neoclassical colonnades wings and buildings were added in the early nineteenth century for a Seaman&#x27;s school. Today the building is both a Grade I listed building and a scheduled monument; A status that includes the axial vista to the River Thames. The house is now serves as part of the National Maritime Museum and is used to display parts of its substantial collection of maritime paintings and portraits.

==Early history==
Queen&#x27;s House is located in Greenwich, London. It was built as an adjunct to the Tudor Palace of Greenwich, previously known before its redevelopment by Henry VII, as the Palace of Placentia; Which was a rambling, red-brick, building in a vernacular style. This would have presented a dramatic contrast of appearance to the newer, white-painted House. The original building was intended as a pavilion with a bridge over the London-Dover road, running between high walls through the park of the palace.
Construction of the house began in 1616, but work on the house stopped in April 1618 when Anne became ill and died the following year. Work restarted when the house was given to the queen consort, Henrietta Maria, in 1629 by King Charles I. The house was structurally complete by 1635.

However, the house&#x27;s original use was short, no more than seven years; The English Civil War began in 1642 and swept away the court culture from which it sprang. Although some of the house&#x27;s interiors survive, including three ceilings and some wall decorations, none of the interior remains in its original state. The process of dismantling the house began as early as 1662, when masons removed a niche and term figures and a chimneypiece.

Artworks that had been commissioned by Charles I for the house, now reside elsewhere; These include a ceiling panel by Orazio Gentileschi, &quot;Allegory of Peace and the Arts&quot;, which is now installed at Marlborough House, London, a large &quot;Finding of Moses&quot;, now on loan from a private collection to the National Gallery, London, and a matching &quot;Joseph and Potiphar&#x27;s Wife,&quot; still in the Royal Collection.
The Queen&#x27;s House, though it was scarcely being used, provided the distant focal centre for Sir Christopher Wren&#x27;s Greenwich Hospital, with a logic and grandeur that has seemed inevitable to architectural historians but in fact depended on Mary II&#x27;s insistence that the vista to the water from the Queen&#x27;s House not be impaired.

== Architecture ==
Built by Inigo Jones in the seventeenth century, the Queen&#x27;s House is England&#x27;s first classical building. Inigo Jones was commissioned by Anne of Denmark in 1616 to build the unique house. At her death in 1619, the house was unfinished. Jones completed the house for Henrietta Maria in 1635. The Queen&#x27;s House is unique in style and characteristics compared to other English buildings of the time. Jones created a first-floor central bridge that joined the two halves of the building. Inigo Jones was heavily influenced by Italian Renaissance architecture and the Palladian style, created by Andrea Palladio. Jones applied the characteristics of harmony, detail, and proportion to the commission. Rather than being in the traditional, red-brick Tudor style like the then existing palace, the house is white and is known for its elegant proportions. Jones felt compelled to reflect political circumstances of the time through his use of his Orders, reflected in his &quot;Roman Sketchbook&quot; notes. In early designs of the Queen&#x27;s house, Jones experimented with using the Corinthian Order in public, which at the time was used as court architecture and was viewed as &quot;masculine and unaffected&quot;.

Two preliminary drawings have been associated with Anne of Denmark&#x27;s commission. The first plan includes a rectangular villa with a circular staircase adjacent to a vaulted square hall with six pilasters along the exterior. The second plan is composed of an H-shaped building with a columnar bay and a balcony, which fits two of the elevations of the Queen&#x27;s House. The completed Queen&#x27;s House, finished under the request of Queen Henrietta Maria, reflects a public restraint mentioned in Jones&#x27; &quot;Roman Sketchbook&quot;. Between 1632 and 1635 a central loggia was added to the south front and Columns were limited to this area. The columns were switched from Corinthian to Ionic to reflect the strictures of Serlio, being made for matrons.

Inigo Jones&#x27; design is famous for two of its aspects: the Great Hall and the Tulip Staircase. The Great Hall is the centerpiece of the Queen&#x27;s House and holds a first-floor gallery that overlooks geometric-styled black and white marble flooring. The Great Hall is recognizable and innovative for its architecture; The shape of this hall is perfect cube, measuring 40 ft in each direction. Much like Jones&#x27; inspiration for the rest of the Queen&#x27;s House, Jones used the rules of proportion created by Palladio.

The Tulip Staircase was an unusual feature during this period and the first of its kind. Made of ornate wrought iron, it is Britain&#x27;s first geometric and unsupported staircase. Each tread is cantilevered from the wall and supported by the step below, a design invented by the mason, Nicholas Stone. Each step is interlocked along the bottom of the riser.[18] Jones found inspiration for the staircase, and the glass lantern above, from Palladio&#x27;s Carita Monastery, where he noted that the staircases with a void in the center &quot;succeed very well because they can have light from above&quot;. Jones hired Nicholas Stone to lay the black and white flooring which mirrored the design of the ceiling.

== Patron ==

=== Anne of Denmark ===
Anne of Denmark, the wife of James I of England, was an important patron of the arts. Anne commissioned her frequent collaborator, Inigo Jones, to refurbish the Queen&#x27;s House in Greenwich. Although the Queen&#x27;s House was not completed before her death in 1619, Anne was able to use the palace at Greenwich as a personal gallery before her death. Both James I and Anne had private galleries and fashioned them in similar ways. Jemma Field describes the spaces as a place of political significance; &quot;All objects and furnishings were appraised as signs of Stuart wealth, merit, and honour&quot;. Anne of Denmark&#x27;s project may have been influenced by her knowledge of garden buildings and hunting lodges in Denmark, and her brother Christian IV of Denmark sent two Danish stonemasons to work for her at Greenwich for nine months.

=== Queen Henrietta Maria ===
Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I, son of Anne and James, inherited the rights to Greenwich Park in 1629. She commissioned Inigo Jones to return and finish the Queen&#x27;s House between approximately 1629 and 1638. As an important patron for contemporary artists, Henrietta acquired and commissioned many works of art for the Queen&#x27;s House. Henrietta used the palace as a &quot;House of Delights&quot; and filled the home with spectacular pieces of art, including the Great Ceiling.

== &quot;Allegory of Peace and the Arts&quot; (Ceiling by Orazio Gentileschi) ==

Orazio Gentileschi, a favorite at the court of Charles I, was commissioned by Queen Henrietta Maria to decorate her &quot;House of Delights&quot;. By Gentileschi&#x27;s death in 1639, the Queen&#x27;s House contained about half of Gentileschi&#x27;s English works, including the ceiling of the Great Hall from 1635 to 1638. The central work of this hall features the &quot;Allegory of Peace and the Arts,&quot; a central tondo surrounded by eight other canvases. The ceiling creates a visual celebration of the reign of King Charles I and his encouragement of peace and the liberal arts. Gentileschi Illuminates the taste and patronage of Henrietta Marie by embodying the power of women throughout the ceiling, all but one of the twenty-six figures are women.

The composition of the ceiling includes a large central tondo with four rectangular canvases on each side of the ceiling and four smaller tondos on the corners.  The central tondo, the personification of Peace is depicted floating on a cloud and is surrounded by the figures representing the Liberal Arts, Victory, and Fortune. The surrounding panels depict the nine Muses, and the personifications of Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, and Music. The image of Peace, in the central tondo, is seated on a cloud and holding an olive branch in one hand and a staff in the other, embodying the message that Peace is a product of good government and rule because of the encouragement of knowledge, learning, creativity while remaining within the realm of Reason. Peace, the only male figure, is positioned in the center of the panel portraying him as the most important and the central quality by allowing the others to be around him. The other twelve females are the personifications of the trivium(Grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and quadrivium(arithmetic, astronomy, music, and geometry) that make up the Liberal Arts.

In 1708, Gentileschi&#x27;s series of nine paintings were removed, given by Queen Anne to Sarah Churchill. They were installed in Marlborough House, St James, where they can still be viewed today.

For the first time since 1639, when Gentileschi worked on the ceiling, another artist has recently worked on the ceiling, Turner Prize winner, Richard Wright. In 2016, Wright and his team of five assistants worked together to fill the empty spaces of the ceiling left behind by the Gentileschi panels. The team used a series of scaffolded flat beds to support them while they transferred a sketch to the ceiling, applied size to the outline, and then covered it with gold leaf. Wright took influence from the geometric patterning on the floor, the intricate details of the tulip staircase, and created a ceiling that reflects the Queen&#x27;s House&#x27;s geometry, beauty, and intracity.

== Construction of the Greenwich Hospital ==

Although the house survived as an official building, being used for the lying-in-state of Commonwealth Generals-at-Sea Richard Dean (1653) and Robert Blake (1657), the main palace was progressively demolished between 1660 and 1690. Between 1696 and 1751, to the master-plan of Sir Christopher Wren, the palace was replaced by the Royal Hospital for Seamen (now referred to as the Old Royal Naval College). Due to the positioning of Queen&#x27;s House, and Queen Mary II&#x27;s request that it retain its view of the river, Wren&#x27;s Hospital architectural design was composed of two matching pairs of courts that were separated by a grand &#x27;visto&#x27; the exact width of the house(115 ft).

Wren&#x27;s first plan, which was blocking the view to the Thames, became known to history as &quot;Christopher Wren&#x27;s faux pas&quot;. The whole ensemble at Greenwich forms an architectural vista that stretches from the Thames to Greenwich Park, and is one of the principal features that in 1997 led UNESCO to inscribe &#x27;Maritime Greenwich&#x27; as a World Heritage Site.

==19th-century additions==
From 1806 the house was used as the center of the Royal Hospital School for the sons of seamen. This change in use necessitated new accommodations; Wings and a flanking pair were added to east and west and connected to the house by colonnades (designed by London Docks architect Daniel Asher Alexander). In 1933, the school moved to Holbrook, Suffolk and its Greenwich buildings, including the house, were converted and restored; They became the new National Maritime Museum (NMM), created by Act of Parliament in 1934 and opened in 1937.

Following construction of the cut-and-cover tunnel between Greenwich and Maze Hill stations, the grounds immediately to the north of the house were reinstated in the late 1870s. The tunnel comprised the continuation of the London and Greenwich Railway and opened in 1878.
==Recent years==
In 2012, the grounds to the south of the Queen&#x27;s House were used to house a stadium for the equestrian events of the Olympic Games. The grounds were used to stage the modern pentathlon, while the Queen&#x27;s House in particular was used as a VIP center for the games.

Work to prepare the Queen&#x27;s House involved some internal re-modelling and work on the lead roof to prepare it for security and camera installations. The house underwent a 14-month restoration beginning in 2015, and reopened on 11 October 2016. The house had previously been restored between 1986 and 1999, with contemporary insertions that modernised the building. The modernization created controversial due to the new ceiling in the main hall created by artist Richard Wright, a Turner prize winner. In some quarters, it provoked some debate: an editorial in &quot;The Burlington Magazine&quot;, November 1995, alluded to &quot;the recent transformation of the Queen&#x27;s House into a theme-park interior of fake furniture and fireplaces, tatty modern plaster casts and clip-on chandeliers&quot;.

==Current use==
The house is now primarily used to display the museum&#x27;s substantial collection of marine paintings and portraits of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries, and for other public and private events. It is normally open to the public daily, free of charge, as well as other museum galleries and the seventeenth-century Royal Observatory, Greenwich, which is also part of the National Maritime Museum.

In Autumn 2022, a 1768 painting by the artist Tilly Kettle went on permanent display. The painting depicts Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet, Richard Kempenfelt and Thomas Parry on &quot;HMS Norfolk&quot; and was purchased by the National Maritime Museum, with assistance from the Society for Nautical Research.

<doc id="340013" wikidata="Q465201" url="?curid=340013" title="Scott Dixon">
<text>Scott Ronald Dixon (born 22 July 1980) is a New Zealand racing driver who races the 9 Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) Dallara DW12-Honda car in the IndyCar Series. He is a six-time drivers&#x27; champion of the IndyCar Series, having claimed the title in 2003, 2008, 2013, 2015, 2018 and 2020, and he won the 2008 Indianapolis 500 with CGR. Dixon has three 24 Hours of Daytona victories – with CGR in 2006 and 2015 and in 2020 with Wayne Taylor Racing – and two Petit Le Mans wins.

Dixon began karting at age seven and won 30 major karting titles in his age group across Australia and New Zealand. Aged 13, he progressed to car racing, winning the 1994 New Zealand Formula Vee Championship, the 1996 New Zealand Formula Ford Class II Championship, the 1998 Australian Drivers&#x27; Championship and the 2000 Indy Lights. He debuted in Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) in 2001 with the PacWest Racing team and won his first major open-wheel race in his third series start before joining CGR in 2002 when PacWest folded due to financial difficulties. Dixon and CGR moved to the IndyCar Series in 2003, winning the title in his debut season with three victories. Following a winless 2004 season, he won one race in the 2005, finished fourth in the 2006 with two victories, and finished second to Dario Franchitti in 2007 with four wins. Dixon won his second IndyCar championship in 2008, with five victories (including the Indianapolis 500).

Dixon finished second to teammate Franchitti in the 2009 season, breaking Sam Hornish Jr.&#x27;s all-time series wins record, and third in each season from 2010 to 2012. He won his third series championship with four victories in 2013, and finished third overall with two victories the following season. In 2015, he won his fourth IndyCar championship, tying Juan Pablo Montoya on points but being declared series champion due to a count-back on the number of victories taken by both drivers. During the 2016 and 2017 season, Dixon&#x27;s form lowered but he took three wins to finish sixth and third overall, respectively. His three victories during the 2018 season earned him his fifth series championship, and he went on to win his sixth title two years later with four victories. After finishing fourth overall with one victory in 2021, Dixon improved on his performance with two wins for third in the points standings in 2022, finished runner-up in 2023 with three victories but he dropped to sixth overall with two wins in 2024.

Overall, Dixon has won 58 races in American open-wheel car racing and finished on the podium 139 times. Since 2004, he has also competed in endurance racing in the American Le Mans Series, the Rolex Sports Car Series, the IMSA SportsCar Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well the International Race of Champions and V8 Supercars. He was named New Zealand&#x27;s Sportsman of the Year in both 2008 and 2013. Dixon was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2009 and a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (CNZM) a decade later.

==Early and personal life==
Dixon was born in Brisbane, Australia on 22 July 1980, the youngest child and only son of middle-class New Zealand expatriates Ron and Glenys Dixon. He has two older sisters. Although he was born in Australia, Dixon holds New Zealand citizenship. Dixon&#x27;s parents raced various types of cars on various circuits, and owned a dirt speedway in Townsville, North Queensland. The family moved to Australia in 1976 in search of better opportunities, settling in Townsville before returning to Auckland, New Zealand, a decade later after a major accident involving his father. Dixon attended Manurewa Central Primary, Green Meadows Intermediate and James Cook High School. He married former British and Welsh 800 metres champion and television presenter Emma Davies-Dixon in February 2008. They have three children.

==Early racing career==

Aged seven, Dixon began racing go-karts after watching his cousins race at Auckland&#x27;s Mt. Wellington oval kart track and tried karting following the conclusion of a raceday. He was encouraged by his parents to pursue a racing career, and was first put into a midget car with a Ironhorse engine at age eight. Dixon was influenced by the success of New Zealand drivers Chris Amon, Denny Hulme and Bruce McLaren. Over the next six years, Dixon parents purchased additional equipment depending on circumstances and Dixon&#x27;s increase in achievements. His father worked long hours importing Omega karts and cars from Japan, to finance his son&#x27;s endeavours and borrowed so much money he did not inform his wife about all of it. During the following five years, Dixon won 30 major Australian and New Zealand-based karting championships in his age group, including the 1992 New Zealand Junior Restricted Championship. 

Aged 13, he began car racing, earning dispensation from Motorsport NZ to obtain a junior competition licence to enter club and national level events in categories up to Formula Ford after lobbying by his parents. Dixon took the 1994 New Zealand Formula Vee Championship at his first attempt to become its youngest champion; He was second in the 1994 New Zealand Formula Class II Championship, and drove the 1994 NZRDC Formula Ford Winter Series. Dixon rolled a Nissan Sentra saloon car onto its roof during a race at Pukekohe Park Raceway, capturing national attention when footage showed him struggling from the upturned car with a cushion strapped to his back to reach the pedals. For the 1995–1996 season, he drove a 1600cc light, low-downforce pushrod open-wheel car in the higher-tier New Zealand Formula Ford Class II Championship, winning the category title with 13 victories in 14 events. Dixon&#x27;s family moved him to the primary Formula Ford class in a 1992 Swift car, securing the 1996–1997 title with 8 wins from 15 starts.

With no help from Motorsport NZ, Dixon&#x27;s family approached open-wheel racer Ken Smith, who became Dixon&#x27;s manager and mentor in their plan to send him to the Australian Drivers&#x27; Championship&#x27;s Formula Holden class. Dixon got race-by-race funding from sponsors and individuals as his family and a small group of local sponsors lost funding. He finished the 14-race series third in the under-powered 1991 Ralt Australia Reynard 91D–Holden car, and was named Rookie of the Year. Dixon initially found it difficult to communicate with team owner Graham Watson because he was not a family member; his school recommended he stop schooling due to his good academic performance and focus on racing. 

To fund his 1998 campaign, investors formed the Scott Dixon Motor Sport (SDMS) company to raise enough money to support Dixon&#x27;s career until a top-team signed him, and allowed him to be paid a salary. He was not allowed to access the Australian Institute of Sport for fitness and media training since he was not an Australian citizen. Driving the 1992 SH Racing Reynard 92D–Holden car in the 12-round series, Dixon achieved five wins, five second-places and seven pole positions to claim the Australian Gold Star Drivers&#x27; Championship, after a season-long duel with future V8 Supercars racer Todd Kelly. He also finished second in the New Zealand Grand Prix.

In late 1998, he moved to the United States and entered the Championship Auto Racing Teams&#x27; (CART) developmental series Indy Lights, hoping to reach Formula One (F1) because SDMS could not afford the more expensive European series such as British Formula 3 with Alan Docking Racing. SDMS approached Tasman Motorsports owner Steve Horne but was unable to secure enough sponsorship for Dixon to drive for the team, so Dixon was tested by Johansson Motorsports owner Stefan Johansson at Sebring International Raceway in Florida. Dixon raced for the team in the 1999 season after legal negotiations with SDMS and additional sponsorship funding. He underwent intensive training in a weighted helmet to strengthen his neck muscles to combat g-forces. Dixon finished fifth in the drivers&#x27; championship in a Lola T97/20-Buick car, with one victory and four top-five finishes, and was second to Jonny Kane in the Rookie of the Year standings. In October 1999, he tested a Formula 3000 car for the Gauloises Junior Team in France, and two months later, finished second in the New Zealand Grand Prix.

After Smith left Dixon&#x27;s management team post-season, Johansson became Dixon&#x27;s manager, deciding if Dixon could not progress to CART in the 2001 season, Dixon would join another team. After seeing Dixon compete in Australia, media manager Brett Murray encouraged PacWest Racing&#x27;s (PWR) Indy Lights development squad to employ him for the 2000 championship. Dixon accepted following SDMS&#x27; decision not to engage in direct contract talks that were done through driver Tony Renna, finalising a five-year contract with 15 days minimum testing with its CART team in April 2000. He won the title with 155 points, six victories and eight top-four finishes, becoming the series&#x27; second-youngest title winner behind Greg Moore.

==CART (2001–2002)==
Dixon was promoted to CART by PacWest owner Bruce McCaw in 2001, replacing the retired Mark Blundell in PWR&#x27;s No. 18 Reynard 01I–Toyota car. His team encouraged him to gain weight before the season began, and he trained with teammate Maurício Gugelmin; he was concerned about acclimating to the longer CART races and developing race strategies. Dixon won the Lehigh Valley Grand Prix at Nazareth Speedway on his third career start, driving 116 laps without stopping for fuel, becoming the youngest winner of a major open-wheel race at the age of 20 years, 9 months, and 14 days. He added another top-three finish at Milwaukee Mile and three fourth-place finishes at Chicago Motor Speedway, Road America and Laguna Seca, finishing eighth in the drivers&#x27; championship with 98 points and winning the Rookie of the Year award.

Dixon returned to the renamed PWR Championship Racing in the 2002 season, with the team switching manufacturers from Reynard to a Lola B02/00-Toyota. Dixon purposefully did not sign a long-term contract with the team so that he could switch to F1 if he impressed teams during testing. Following his two top-ten finishes at Monterrey and Motegi in the first three races, financial trouble forced PWR to disband. This prompted Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) to sign Dixon to drive its third car for the rest of the season after discussions with his family, team owner Chip Ganassi, and engine manufacturer Toyota during preparations for the Indianapolis 500. Dixon became compatible with his teammates Bruno Junqueira and Kenny Bräck and had to learn about CGR&#x27;s expectations. The rest of the season saw him achieve nine top-ten finishes including a season-best second at the Grand Prix of Denver late in the year. Dixon finished 13th in the final drivers&#x27; championship standings with 97 points.

== IndyCar Series (2003–present) ==

=== 2003–2006 ===
Dixon and CGR switched from CART to the IndyCar Series before the 2003 season, partly due to financial incentives and a desire to compete in the Indianapolis 500. Although he was hesitant to participate in the all-oval track series because he was a road course specialist, he quickly adapted to ovals. Dixon won his debut race, the Toyota Indy 300 at Homestead–Miami Speedway, after leading the final 53 laps. He sustained injuries in an accident with Tony Kanaan at Motegi two races later. At his first Indianapolis 500, he qualified fourth; late in the race, he lost control of his car and spun through 180 degrees, finishing 17th. Dixon took successive wins at Pikes Peak International Raceway and Richmond International Raceway and four second places in the next ten races. He entered the season-ending Chevy 500 at Texas Motor Speedway as one of five title contenders and tied on points with Team Penske&#x27;s Hélio Castroneves who required a victory to win the championship. Dixon finished second, ahead of all other title contenders, to win the championship with 507 points.

In the second round of the 2004 championship, he finished second at Phoenix International Raceway, followed by a fifth-place finish in the following round at Motegi. The remaining twelve races saw him achieve seven more top-tens with his best performance during that period being a fifth place in the final round, the Chevy 500 at Texas, for tenth overall with 355 points. His Toyota engine lacked power, causing him to be slower than drivers racing better developed Honda engines, particularly when IndyCar implemented a rule change lowering engine sizes from 3.5 L to 3.0 L at the Indianapolis 500. Dixon, according to Smith, would occasionally overdrive his car, causing handling issues entering corners.

Dixon stayed at CGR for the 2005 season after signing a contract extension to stay in IndyCar until the conclusion of the 2006 championship in May 2004. He had implants installed in the corner of his left eye to restore it to optimal sight for oval circuits, and focused fully on IndyCar following F1 testing for the Williams team in Europe and racing in the International Race of Champions (IROC) early the previous year. The beginning of the year saw him struggle in comparison with his previous two years in IndyCar with CGR. At the Indianapolis 500, he qualified in 13th position but a lap 114 two-car accident with Richie Hearn saw him finish 24th. At Watkins Glen for the Watkins Glen Indy Grand Prix, Dixon led a event-high 25 laps for his first series victory in 40 races. He finished 13th in the drivers&#x27; championship with 321 points. 

CGR switched from the underpowered Toyota engine to the more powerful Honda engine for the 2006 season after Toyota left IndyCar to focus on NASCAR and the ubiquitous Dallara chassis. He concentrated on improving his abilities on oval tracks, and learnt from teammate Dan Wheldon how to improve his performance on ovals. Dixon began 2006 with consecutive second-places in St. Petersburg and Motegi. He qualified fourth for the Indianapolis 500 and battled for the lead until he was imposed a drive-through penalty for blocking Kanaan, causing him to finish sixth. Dixon then won the following wet-weather Watkins Glen Indy Grand Prix, his fifth career victory, after passing Buddy Rice with nine laps left. He went on to achieve victory in the Firestone Indy 200 at Nashville Speedway four races later by 0.1176 seconds over Wheldon after leading the final 67 laps. Going into the season-ending Peak Antifreeze Indy 300 at Chicagoland Speedway, Dixon was one of four drivers mathematically eligible win the championship; however, he finished second and was fourth overall with 460 points.

=== 2007–2010 ===

Dixon began the 2007 season with two podium finishes and two fourth places within the first four rounds before qualifying fourth for the Indianapolis 500 and finishing the rain-shortened race second. He won three consecutive races at Watkins Glen, Nashville and Mid-Ohio, tying a series record set by Bräck in the 1998 season and Wheldon in the 2005 championship, lowering Dario Franchitti&#x27;s points advantage from 65 to 24. Dixon won the Motorola Indy 300 at Sonoma three rounds later, passing Franchitti&#x27;s damaged car late in the race to take the championship lead from the latter. He was second overall with three fewer points than Franchitti going into the season-ending Peak Antifreeze Indy 300 in Chicago, and one of three competitors who could mathematically claim the drivers&#x27; championship. Late on the race&#x27;s final lap, Dixon was leading when his car ran out of fuel, causing him to finish runner-up to Franchitti with 624 points.

The 2008 season saw Dixon return to CGR, winning the season-opening Gainsco Auto Insurance Indy 300 at Homestead from pole position. After two third-places at Motegi and Kansas Speedway (from pole position), his season highlight was winning the Indianapolis 500 for the first (and only) time in his career, leading 115 laps from pole position. Dixon won the Bombardier Learjet 550 from pole position two races later in Texas, and then the rain-shortened Firestone Indy 200 in Nashville. He achieved consecutive wins in the Rexall Edmonton Indy at Edmonton City Centre Airport and the Meijer Indy 300 at Kentucky in which he led 151 laps from pole position after Castroneves ran out of fuel on the final lap. Dixon led Castroneves by 30 championship points entering the season-ending Peak Antifreeze Indy 300; he won his second series title after finishing 0.0033 seconds behind race winner Castroneves in the series&#x27; second-closest finish.

For his title defence in the 2009 season, Dixon raced for CGR. Following two subpar races, he led 134 laps to win the season&#x27;s third round, the RoadRunner Turbo Indy 300 at Kansas. Dixon won the ABC Supply Company A.J. Foyt 225 at Milwaukee for the championship lead two races later. At Richmond for the SunTrust Indy Challenge, he led 161 laps in his third victory of 2009, equalling Sam Hornish Jr.&#x27;s series record career wins with his 19th. Following his finishes at Watkins Glen and Edmonton, Dixon won his season&#x27;s fourth race in the Honda 200 at Mid-Ohio, breaking Hornish&#x27;s all-time victory record. His fifth and final victory of 2009 was the Indy Japan 300 at Motegi, leading 139 laps from pole position. Dixon entered the season-ending Firestone Indy 300 as one of three drivers eligible for the championship. With 605 points, he finished third in the race and was championship runner-up to teammate Franchitti.

Dixon&#x27;s 2010 season began with three top-seven finishes in the first four races before leading 167 laps of the RoadRunner Turbo Indy 300 to win the event for the second consecutive year in Kansas. Following four top-eight finishes, he won the Honda Indy Edmonton after Castroneves was deemed to have blocked his Penske teammate Will Power. Dixon finished no lower than eighth in the five rounds that followed, including a second-place finish at Sonoma Raceway. He was mathematically eliminated from winning the championship after finishing sixth in the Indy Japan 300 at Motegi, but he finished the season by winning the 2010 Cafés do Brasil Indy 300 at Homestead to finish third overall with 547 points.

=== 2011–2015 ===

In the 2011 championship, Dixon again returned to drive for CGR. During the season&#x27;s first eleven races, he finished in the top ten seven times, including second-place finishes at Barber Motorsports Park, the Texas doubleheader, and Toronto. Dixon won the Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio for the third time after leading 50 laps from pole position. He led 62 laps of the Indy Japan: The Final at Motegi to win the event from pole position three races later. Dixon&#x27;s third-place finish in the following Kentucky Indy 300 at Kentucky allowed him to beat Franchitti to the A. J. Foyt Oval Trophy despite having no oval victories in 2011. He was third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 518 points.

For the 2012 season, Dixon competed for CGR; engine reliability problems affected his performance that year. Three second-place finishes in the season&#x27;s first five races came at St. Petersburg, Barber, and the Indianapolis 500. Dixon won the Chevrolet Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix at The Raceway on Belle Isle after leading every lap from pole position. Six races later, he qualified fourth for the Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio, where he won his second race of the season. Dixon was one of four drivers eligible for the drivers&#x27; championship after finishing fourth in the Grand Prix of Baltimore on the streets of Baltimore. He was 53 points behind championship leader Power. He finished third in the season-ending MAVTV 500 IndyCar World Championships at Auto Club Speedway for third overall with 435 points.

Dixon signed a three-year contract extension to remain at CGR for the 2013 season and through to the end of the 2015 championship in mid-2012. His Honda engined car had less power than Chevrolet engined vehicles. Dixon finished second at Barber and four other times in the season&#x27;s first ten rounds. He started 17th in the Pocono IndyCar 400 at Pocono Raceway and held off teammate Charlie Kimball for his first victory of the season. Dixon won both races of the Honda Indy Toronto doubleheader (leading 81 laps in the second event from pole position) and moved into second place in the championship standings one week later. He won the first race of the Shell-Pennzoil Grand Prix of Houston doubleheader and finished second in the second race to overtake Castroneves (who had mechanical issues) as the season-ending MAVTV 500 IndyCar World Championships at Auto Club Speedway approached. Dixon won his third series title with 577 points after finishing fifth at Auto Club.

Dixon drove a Chevrolet-powered car for the first time in the 2014 season, after CGR switched from Honda to have both the IndyCar and NASCAR teams partnered with the same engine manufacturer. His engines had a power delivery issue that slightly exaggerated shock/damper setup issues, and changes in centre of gravity and weight distribution caused traction issues exiting corners, requiring him to accelerate more cautiously. Dixon finished third once at Barber and had seven top-ten finishes in the first fourteen races of the season before winning the Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio after starting 22nd. He overtook Mike Conway to win the GoPro Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma two races later. He finished third in the final championship standings with 604 points after finishing second in the season finale at Auto Club.

He returned to CGR for the 2015 season. Dixon qualified third for the season&#x27;s third round, the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach and led 44 laps to claim his first win at the event. He took pole position for the Indianapolis 500 and led 84 laps before finishing fourth due to a lack of speed late in the race. Dixon started seventh in the Firestone 600 at Texas three races later and led 97 laps in his second victory of the season. He finished fifth five times in the next six races, including a pole position at the Iowa race. Dixon was one of six drivers vying for the championship heading into the season-ending GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma, securing the race victory and his fourth championship title. Although he and Penske driver Juan Pablo Montoya had the same number of points (556), the tie was broken by wins; Dixon won three races and Montoya two.

=== 2016–2020 ===
He drove for CGR in the 2016 season after signing a three-year contract extension with the team in mid-2015 and was outperformed by Penske engineering-wise. Dixon started seventh and led the final 155 laps of the Desert Diamond West Valley Phoenix Grand Prix at Phoenix International Raceway for his first win of the season, breaking a series record for wins in consecutive seasons with 12. Dixon had eight top-ten in the next twelve races after failing to finish three races due to unreliability and one in the Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio due to an accident with Castroneves and qualifying on pole position for the race at Toronto. He won the IndyCar Grand Prix at The Glen after starting on pole and leading 50 laps. With 477 points after finishing 17th in the season finale at Sonoma, he finished sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, the first time he finished outside the top three in points since 2005.

CGR returned to Honda engines before the 2017 season after three seasons with Chevrolet. Dixon finished third at St. Petersburg, Barber, and the Indianapolis road course in his first five races. He qualified on pole for the Indianapolis 500; during the race, he crashed airborne into the inside barrier after hitting Jay Howard&#x27;s left-rear wheel on lap 53. Dixon and Howard were unhurt. He took the championship lead from Castroneves by finishing second in the first race of the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix doubleheader, and won the Kohler Grand Prix at Road America three races later. He finished no lower than tenth in the next six races, including consecutive second places at Gateway Motorsports Park and Watkins Glen, and was three points behind championship leader Josef Newgarden heading into the season-ending GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma. Dixon finished fourth, putting him third in the final championship standings with 621 points.

He drove a car equipped with a new universal aerodynamic car package for the 2018 season and had no technical disadvantage to Penske. He took five top-ten finishes, including consecutive podiums at the Indianapolis road course and the Indianapolis 500 in the first six races. Dixon won the first race of the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix doubleheader after leading 39 laps, and he led the final 119 laps of the DXC Technology 600 at Texas for the championship lead two races later. Three races after Texas, he won his third and final race of 2018, the Honda Indy Toronto. Dixon finished no lower than fifth in the year&#x27;s final five races and took pole position at Gateway. He won his fifth IndyCar championship finishing second in the season-ending Grand Prix of Sonoma, scoring 678 points.

Dixon signed a multi-year contract extension with CGR through to the end of the 2023 season after rejecting an offer from McLaren CEO Zak Brown to join the brand&#x27;s IndyCar team for a rumoured three seasons before the 2019 championship. The season&#x27;s first seven races yielded four podium finishes in St. Petersburg, Barber, Long Beach and the Indianapolis road course. Dixon won the second race of the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix doubleheader after starting sixth. Following four top-five finishes, he held off teammate Felix Rosenqvist to win the Honda Indy 200 from eighth, his second and final victory of 2019 and sixth at Mid-Ohio. Dixon finished fourth in the final Drivers&#x27; Championship standings with 578 points after finishing on the podium twice more at Pocono and Laguna Seca.

The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic delayed and shortened the 2020 season to 14 events, and Indiana&#x27;s lockdown required Dixon to prepare at home for the return to racing. At the season-opening Genesys 300 round in Texas, he qualified second and led 157 of 200 laps, matching A. J. Foyt&#x27;s record of 18 seasons with a victory. Dixon then won the GMR Grand Prix at the Indianapolis road course and the first race of the REV Group Grand Prix doubleheader at Road America. He finished second in the first race of the Iowa doubleheader and led a race-high 111 laps in the Indianapolis 500. Dixon took his 50th career win in the opening round of the following Bommarito Automotive Group 500 doubleheader at Gateway. He finished no lower than tenth in the final five races, and won his sixth drivers&#x27; championship by 16 points over Newgarden in the season-ending Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, finishing third.

=== 2021–present ===

Dixon started the 2021 championship by finishing at Barber and third in St. Petersburg. He started third for the first race of the Genesys 300 doubleheader at Texas, leading 206 of 212 laps in his first and only victory of the year to take the championship lead and surpass Foyt&#x27;s record of winning a race in the most seasons during his 19th season. Dixon took two pole positions in the second Genesys 300 round and the Indianapolis 500 but lost the championship lead to teammate Álex Palou after finishing 17th in the latter event. He took three more podiums and four top-tens and was fourth in the final season standings with 481 points.

He finished in the top ten in each of the first five races of the 2022 season, with a best result of fifth place at Texas. He qualified on pole for the fifth time in the Indianapolis 500. Dixon led 95 laps but failed to win the race due to a drive-through penalty for overspeeding by in the pit lane following his final pit stop. Four races later, he started second in the Honda Indy Toronto and led 40 laps to claim his fourth Toronto victory. Dixon won the Big Machine Music City Grand Prix four races later on the streets of downtown Nashville. He was one of five drivers mathematically eligible to win the championship heading into the season finale, the Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey at Laguna Seca. A lack of speed in the race restricted him to 12th and he was fourth in the championship standings with 521 points.

Dixon started the 2023 season improving his performance in qualifying from the year before, and securing a third position at St. Petersburg and top ten finishes in the three of the next four races as a result of a byproduct of an engineering and strategy team reshuffle. A rare retirement following contact with Pato O&#x27;Ward at Long Beach put Dixon in a deficit for championship points. After Dixon and his crew began developing more and he and his timing team began understanding their own needs, Dixon&#x27;s results improved. He extended his record streak of consecutive seasons with at least one race victory to 19 by winning the Gallagher Grand Prix while on an alternative strategy following a first-lap spin; he also surpassed Kanaan&#x27;s record of consecutive IndyCar starts in the same race. Dixon then led 82 laps of the following Bommarito Automotive Group 500 to win and become teammate Palou&#x27;s only championship rival after Newgarden crashed. He was mathematically eliminated from title contention after finishing third at the BitNile.com Grand Prix of Portland, which Palou won, but he did secure second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. He overcame a drive-through penalty for contact on the first lap to end the season with a victory in the Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey.

At the second round of the 2024 season, the Grand Prix of Long Beach, Dixon employed a fuel-saving strategy for more than half the race following a yellow flag caution period to win the event for the second time. After two more top six finishes in the following three races with sub-par performances in qualifying, he won the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix through another fuel-saving strategy and holding off Marcus Ericsson to take the championship lead from teammate Palou. Although he lost the realistic prospect of winning his seventh drivers&#x27; title after an accident at the Grand Prix of Portland, his second-place finish in the second race of the Hy-Vee Milwaukee Mile 250s moved him past Mario Andretti for the record of most career IndyCar podiums with his 142nd. Dixon was sixth in the points standings with 456.

==Sports car career==

Dixon made his endurance racing debut in the 1999 Petit Le Mans (part of the American Le Mans Series), retiring the No. 36 Ferrari 333 SP LMP class car he shared with Johansson and Jim Matthews due to gearbox problems. He competed in the 2004 24 Hours of Daytona (part of the Rolex Sports Car Series) with Jimmy Morales, Max Papis, and Scott Pruett, finishing sixth in class and tenth overall in CGR&#x27;s No. 1 Riley MkXI-Lexus Daytona Prototype (DP). Dixon went on to finish third in the Lexus Grand American 400 alongside Darren Manning. The following year, he again drove the 24 Hours of Daytona in Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates&#x27; (CGRFS) No. 3 entry, finishing sixth with Manning and Casey Mears. Dixon, Mears and Wheldon won the 2006 24 Hours of Daytona, completing 734 laps in CGRFS&#x27; No. 2 Riley-Lexus. He finished fourth in the season-ending Discount Tire Sunchaser at Miller Motorsports Park, alongside co-drivers Luis Díaz and Pruett in the No. 1 entry.

Dixon entered the 24 Hours of Daytona with Memo Rojas and Wheldon in 2007, retiring after 538 laps when Rojas crashed the No. 2 car on the saturated track in the 21st hour for 21st in class and 41st overall. He raced alongside Salvador Durán, Alex Lloyd, and Wheldon in the 2008 24 Hours of Daytona, finishing 41st overall (18th in class) after 515 laps due to three crashes. Dixon finished fifth in class and eighth overall in De Ferran Motorsports&#x27; No. 66 Acura ARX-01b in the 2008 Petit Le Mans Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) category alongside Gil de Ferran and Simon Pagenaud. He, Franchitti and Lloyd were fifth in the 2009 24 Hours of Daytona in CGRFS&#x27; No. 2 Riley-Lexus car. Dixon co-drove De Ferran Motorsports&#x27; No. 66 Acura ARX-02a Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) car with De Ferran and Pagenaud in both the 12 Hours of Sebring and the Petit Le Mans. He qualified on pole in Sebring but did not finish due to mechanical issues and was 24th in Petit Le Mans.

Dixon competed in the 24 Hours of Daytona from 2010 to 2012, sharing the No. 2 Riley MkXX-BMW with Franchitti, Jamie McMurray, and Montoya. They finished 37th in 2010 due to mechanical failure, but finished second and fourth in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In July 2012, he, McMurray, and Montoya returned to the Rolex Sports Car Series for the three-hour Brickyard Grand Prix at Indianapolis in CGRFS&#x27; No. 2 car, finishing fourth. Although Dixon, Franchitti, Joey Hand and McMurray were 37th in the 2013 24 Hours of Daytona due to McMurray&#x27;s accident following a pit stop, he and Franchitti were third in the Continental Tire Sports Car Festival. In 2014, he, Marino Franchitti, Kanaan, and Kyle Larson finished eighth in class and 15th overall in the 24 Hours of Daytona after mechanical issues, and sixth in the 12 Hours of Sebring with Kanaan and Sage Karam. Dixon joined Pruett and Rojas at the No. 1 team for the season-ending Petit Le Mans, finishing third.

He, Kanaan, Larson and McMurray won the 2015 24 Hours of Daytona, completing 740 laps in the No. 2 CGRFS Riley-Ford car. Dixon was paired with Hand and Pruett to CGRFS&#x27;s No. 1 lineup for both the 12 Hours of Sebring and the Petit Le Mans, finishing fourth in both races. Dixon was joined by Kanaan, Larson, and McMurray for the 2016 24 Hours of Daytona; brake issues caused Larson to crash, leaving the No. 2 car 13th overall. He raced Ford CGR&#x27;s No. 67 Ford GT alongside Ryan Briscoe and Richard Westbrook in the 12 Hours of Sebring and the Petit Le Mans as well as the No. 69 car in the Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) 24 Hours of Le Mans for the next three years. The trio&#x27;s best Le Mans LMGTE Pro class finish was third in 2016, and they won the GTLM category of the 2018 24 Hours of Daytona after 783 laps.

In 2020, he entered the 24 Hours of Daytona, this time with Wayne Taylor Racing (WTR). The No. 10 Cadillac DPi-V.R he shared with Briscoe, Kamui Kobayashi and Renger van der Zande won in a record-breaking 833 laps. Dixon finished 16th overall in the Bathurst 12 Hour with R-Motorsport&#x27;s No. 76 Pro class Aston Martin Vantage AMR GT3 he shared with Jake Dennis and Rick Kelly one week later. He, Briscoe and Van Der Zande won the Petit Le Mans and were seventh in the 12 Hours of Sebring with WTR. Dixon finished fifth in both the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2021, driving the No. 1 Cadillac CGR DPi-V.R with Kevin Magnussen and Van Der Zande. He, Earl Bamber and Van Der Zande were fifth in the season-ending Petit Le Mans. In the 2022 24 Hours of Daytona, he finished seventh in class and 14th overall in the No. 1 car alongside Sébastien Bourdais, Palou, and Van Der Zande; he missed the 12 Hours of Sebring because of an IndyCar commitment at Texas and was replaced by Ryan Hunter-Reay. He finished fourth in the season-ending Petit Le Mans alongside Bourdais and Van Der Zande.

Dixon competed in the 2023 24 Hours of Daytona as a co-driver in the No. 1 Cadillac V-LHDh car with Bourdais and Van Der Zande, finishing third overall. He, Bourdais and Van Der Zande went on to finish fourth in the 2023 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the trio were second overall at the season-ending Petit Le Mans. Dixon, Bourdais, Palou and Van Der Zande retired from the 2024 24 Hours of Daytona with a mechanical powertrain fault, and Dixon, Bourdais and Van Der Zande finished second overall in the 12 Hours of Sebring after a late race duel with WTR. Dixon, Bourdais and Van Der Zande teamed up again for the 2024 24 Hours of Le Mans, retiring after 18 hours with an unrepairable oil leak. The trio came from two laps down after two drive-through penalties to win the season-ending Petit Le Mans.

Dixon is set to share the No. 60 Acura ARX-06 for the five Endurance Cup races of the 2025 IMSA SportsCar Championship alongside full-time IMSA drivers Colin Braun and Tom Blomqvist at Meyer Shank Racing, joined by Rosenqvist for the 24 Hours of Daytona. The team finished second at Daytona.

==Other racing ventures==
Dixon was one of twelve drivers invited to compete in the four-race IROC stock car racing series in 2004, driving an identically prepared Pontiac Firebird. He finished in the bottom half of the top ten in all four races and finished the season in tenth place in the points standings with 25 points. Dixon joined Kelly Racing as Todd Kelly&#x27;s international co-driver in the No. 7 Holden VE Commodore for the 2010 V8 Supercar Championship Series&#x27; Armor All Gold Coast 600 double header event, finishing 20th in the first race and crashing in the second.

After his manager Johansson convinced the Williams F1 team to test him for a possible race seat in , he underwent a two-part assessment for the squad at the Circuit Paul Ricard in France and the Circuit de Catalunya in Spain in early 2004. The tests did not result in Dixon being signed to the Williams team in either a testing or a racing capacity because it was uninterested in employing a rookie.

== Driving style ==
Dixon generally performs better in a race than in a qualifying session. According to Palou, Dixon can maximise car performance consistency over a stint, a race or a season. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;&#x27;s Fred Smith writes that Dixon has a reputation of being patient, something Dixon says came from his formative years of racing cars when he could not afford to make an error otherwise he would have to stop competing because his family lacked money. &quot;The Race&quot;&#x27;s Matt Beer and Jack Benyon write that Dixon is consistent not &quot;in the boring sense of hanging back in third and fourth while others screw up&quot; but rather &quot;in the sense of always maximising what&#x27;s possible amid the often crazy circumstances of IndyCar races&quot; and that &quot;Rival after rival has discovered how hard it is to shake Dixon off in a title fight, no matter what degree of plight he seems to be in during any given race.&quot; 

According to &quot;Racer&quot;&#x27;s Jeff Olson, Dixon prefers to drive a car with oversteer for better driveability, and racing journalist Marshall Pruett observes the driver&#x27;s ability to perform 100 micro-corrections with the steering wheel during each lap. David Malsher-Lopez, writing for &quot;Motorsport.com&quot; characterised Dixon&#x27;s handling style as not proactive but &quot;reactive, a reflex match with the vagaries of car handling and physics.&quot; Since his early years competing in the IndyCar Series, he has been able to save more fuel than other drivers while driving faster because he requests information when each of his stints begins thorough preparation and car setups decided beforehand and operates within the limits of his given fuel mileage number by being as efficient as possible in a stint, allowing him to make fewer or faster pit stops. He attempts to ensure before the race that he is aware he will be provided with a car that drives well through a corner when in such a scenario.

==Non-racing ventures and recognition==

He is an ambassador for the youth cancer patients&#x27; support group CanTeen and Teen Cancer America because he feels teenagers with cancer as a group are overlooked. Dixon is also an ambassador for the Richard Mille watch maker, and supports CGR&#x27;s Women in Motorsport initiative because he is the father of two daughters and believes women in an IndyCar team could improve performance. He has done business with the US division of the New Zealand appliance manufacturer Fisher &amp; Paykel, and has fundraised for children&#x27;s charities. He and his wife were honorary co-chairs of IndyHumane&#x27;s annual Mutt Strut dog walk fundraiser at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in April 2019.

Dixon has been a director of Concept Motorsport New Zealand since 2012. He appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; three times. Dixon was a guest on the 28 May 2008 edition of &quot;Live With Regis and Kelly&quot;, and was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 21 September 2008. In July 2017, he appeared on &quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage&quot;, and his life and 2017 IndyCar season were the subject of the 2018 Bryn Evans documentary &quot;Born Racer&quot;.

Dixon was awarded the Jim Clark Trophy in 1999, 2001, 2004, and 2019 &quot;for the New Zealand driver competing at a National or higher level who shows a sportsmanlike attitude to the sport and fellow competitors and natural ability in &quot;putting up the most meritorious racing performance during the season&quot; and the Bruce McLaren Trophy in 2003 and 2008. In the 2009 New Year Honours, he was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit and was appointed Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2019 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, both for &quot;for services to motorsport&quot;. Dixon was named New Zealand&#x27;s Sportsman of the Year in 2008 and 2013 and was nominated in 2003, 2009, 2015, 2018 and 2021. 

NZ Post issued the New Zealand Champions of World Motorsport stamp series featuring him and four other New Zealand motor racing champions in early 2009. Dixon was inducted into the MotorSport New Zealand Wall of Fame in 2009 and the Road to Indy Hall of Fame in 2014. In July 2013, he was named by &quot;Autosport&quot; magazine as one of the 50 greatest drivers to have never raced in F1. Joe Hogsett, the Mayor of Indianapolis, recognised Dixon&#x27;s motor racing achievements by declaring 24 September 2018 &quot;Scott Dixon Day&quot; in Indianapolis. He was inducted into the Open Wheel category of the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in March 2024.

<doc id="340025" wikidata="Q1424839" url="?curid=340025" title="Palace of Placentia">
<text>The Palace of Placentia, also known as Greenwich Palace,
was an English royal residence that was initially built by prince Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, in 1443. Over the centuries it took several different forms, until turned into a hospital in the 1690s. The palace was a place designed for pleasure, entertainment and an escape from the city. It was located at Greenwich on the south bank of the River Thames, downstream from London.

On a hill behind his palace, the duke built Duke Humphrey&#x27;s Tower, later known as Greenwich Castle; the &quot;castle&quot; was subsequently demolished to make way for the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, which survives. The original river-side residence was extensively rebuilt around 1500 by King Henry VII. A detached residence, the Queen&#x27;s House, was built on the estate in the early 1600s and also survives. In 1660, the old main palace was demolished by Charles II to make way for a proposed new palace, which was only partly constructed in the east wing. Nearly forty years later, at the behest of Queen Mary II, the Greenwich Hospital (now called the Old Royal Naval College) remodeled this wing, expanded, and rebuilt on the site.

==History==
Humphrey was regent during the minority of Henry VI (his nephew) and started building the palace in 1433, under the name Bella Court. In 1447, Humphrey fell out of favour with Henry VI and was arrested for high treason. He died in prison, likely due to a stroke, though it was popularly believed that he was murdered (as is depicted in William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays about Henry VI). Margaret of Anjou took over Bella Court, renaming it the Palace of Placentia, sometimes written as the &#x27;Palace of Pleasaunce&#x27;.

In 1485, Edward IV gave land and property adjacent to the palace for the foundation of a friary by the Observant Friars (a branch of the Franciscans). The friars&#x27; church was used for royal baptisms and marriages, including the christenings of the future queens Mary I and Elizabeth I. However, the friars were persecuted during the English Reformation and finally expelled by Elizabeth I in 1559.

In the next centuries, the name &quot;Greenwich Palace&quot; was commonly used. Henry VII rebuilt the palace between 1498 and 1504. The master mason was Robert Vertue. The design included new plans or &quot;platt of Greenwich which was devised by the Queen&quot;, which highlights the key contribution of Elizabeth of York for the rebuild. The King&#x27;s lodgings were on the bank of the Thames, including a five-storey tower or donjon. The tower and lodgings seem to have derived from Burgundian precedents such as the (now demolished) Ducal Palace at Ghent and the Princehof at Bruges. Greenwich remained the principal royal palace for the next two centuries.

The palace was the birthplace of Henry VIII in 1491, and it figured largely in his life. Following the King&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Greenwich Palace was the birthplace of Mary I in 1516.

After Henry VIII&#x27;s marriage to Anne Boleyn, his daughter, later Elizabeth I, was born at Greenwich Palace in 1533. New wooden coops were made for the peacocks and a pelican, further from the palace, as their calls disturbed Anne Boleyn in the mornings. Henry VIII married Anne of Cleves at Greenwich in 1540. A fallen tree in Greenwich Park is known as Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Oak, in which she is reputed to have played as a child.

Both Mary and Elizabeth lived at Greenwich Palace for some years during the sixteenth century, but during the reigns of James I and Charles I, the Queen&#x27;s House was erected to the south of the palace. When James I ordered the redecoration of the chapel in May 1623 it had not been refurbished since the reign of Mary I. The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War, serving time as a biscuit factory and a prisoner-of-war camp.

In 1660, Charles II decided to rebuild the palace, engaging John Webb as the architect for a new King&#x27;s House. The only section of the new building to be completed was the east range of the present King Charles Court, but this was never occupied as a royal residence. Most of the rest of the palace was demolished, and the site remained empty until construction of the Greenwich Hospital began in 1694.

== Architecture ==
The palace at Greenwich was built in the Tudor style. Although the structure is no longer standing, the size and design of Greenwich Palace were said to be similar to that of Hampton Court Palace in west London, which was built around the same time as Henry VII&#x27;s rebuild of Placentia.

The original building was constructed primarily with brick and timber. The initial palace design had state apartments, a chapel, a five-storey viewing tower, and two octagonal towers overlooking the tiltyard. The chapel, which was rebuilt by Henry VIII, featured stained-glass windows and black-and-white glazed tiles. The main face of the building looked out over the river Thames. It extended along 200m of the bank of the river and was accessible by boat. Piles from the original Tudor-era jetty remain today. Its red-brick exterior showcased the monarchy&#x27;s wealth as the material was expensive to manufacture and considered an extravagance. Aside from chapel renovations, Henry VIII also added an armoury, stables, and a banquet hall to the original palace.

During the early 17th century, as the palace was being rebuilt, Anne of Denmark commissioned several buildings including the Queen&#x27;s House, three rooms along the garden, and a grotto aviary to be built in the gardens. The aviary was designed by Salomon de Caus, a French architect and engineer. It was ornately decorated with pearls and shells and was covered in moss. The only surviving building of the 17th-century additions to the palace is the Queen&#x27;s House. This building, designed by architect Inigo Jones, is of particular architectural and historical significance as it is often credited as being the first classical building in England, and was a clear departure from the Tudor style.

Archeological work in 2017 gave new insight into the architecture of the old palace. One of the more notable findings was lead-glazed tiles. These tiles were probably used as the flooring for the service areas such as the kitchen.

==Modern era==
The Greenwich Hospital complex became the Greenwich Royal Naval College in 1873, when the naval college was moved from Portsmouth. The buildings are today occupied by the University of Greenwich and the music faculty of Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance.

Construction work for drains in late 2005 identified previously unknown Tudor remains. A full archaeological excavation completed in January 2006 found the Tudor Chapel and Vestry with its tiled floor &quot;in situ&quot;. The vestry of the old palace was not demolished and later became the home of the treasurer of Greenwich Hospital.

During construction of the visitors&#x27; centre for the painted hall in 2017, two more Tudor palace rooms were uncovered. One room contained bee holes for keeping hives in the winter. The other was believed to be part of the service range.

<doc id="340026" wikidata="Q3624153" url="?curid=340026" title="Medieval art">
<text>The medieval art of the Western world covers a vast scope of time and place, with over 1000 years of art in Europe, and at certain periods in Western Asia and Northern Africa. It includes major art movements and periods, national and regional art, genres, revivals, the artists&#x27; crafts, and the artists themselves.

Art historians attempt to classify medieval art into major periods and styles, often with some difficulty. A generally accepted scheme includes the later phases of Early Christian art, Migration Period art, Byzantine art, Insular art, Pre-Romanesque, Romanesque art, and Gothic art, as well as many other periods within these central styles. In addition, each region, mostly during the period in the process of becoming nations or cultures, had its own distinct artistic style, such as Anglo-Saxon art or Viking art.

Medieval art was produced in many media, and works survive in large numbers in sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, stained glass, metalwork and mosaics, all of which have had a higher survival rate than other media such as fresco wall-paintings, work in precious metals or textiles, including tapestry. Especially in the early part of the period, works in the so-called &quot;minor arts&quot; or decorative arts, such as metalwork, ivory carving, vitreous enamel and embroidery using precious metals, were probably more highly valued than paintings or monumental sculpture.

Medieval art in Europe grew out of the artistic heritage of the Roman Empire and the iconographic traditions of the early Christian church. These sources were mixed with the vigorous &quot;barbarian&quot; artistic culture of Northern Europe to produce a remarkable artistic legacy. Indeed, the history of medieval art can be seen as the history of the interplay between the elements of classical, early Christian and &quot;barbarian&quot; art. Apart from the formal aspects of classicism, there was a continuous tradition of realistic depiction of objects that survived in Byzantine art throughout the period, while in the West it appears intermittently, combining and sometimes competing with new expressionist possibilities developed in Western Europe and the Northern legacy of energetic decorative elements. The period ended with the self-perceived Renaissance recovery of the skills and values of classical art, and the artistic legacy of the Middle Ages was then disparaged for some centuries. Since a revival of interest and understanding in the 19th century it has been seen as a period of enormous achievement that underlies the development of later Western art.

==Overview==

The first several centuries of the Middle Ages in Europe — up to about 800 AD - saw a decrease in prosperity, stability, and population, followed by a fairly steady and general increase until the massive setback of the Black Death around 1350, which is estimated to have killed at least a third of the overall population in Europe, with generally higher rates in the south and lower in the north. Many regions did not regain their former population levels until the 17th century. The population of Europe is estimated to have reached a low point of about 18 million in 650, to have doubled around the year 1000, and to have reached over 70 million by 1340, just before the Black Death. In 1450 it was still only 50 million. To these figures, Northern Europe, especially Britain, contributed a lower proportion than today, and Southern Europe, including France, a higher one. The increase in prosperity, for those who survived, was much less affected by the Black Death. Until about the 11th century most of Europe was short of agricultural labour, with large amounts of unused land, and the Medieval Warm Period benefited agriculture until about 1315.

The medieval period eventually saw the falling away of the invasions and incursions from outside the area that characterised the first millennium. The Islamic conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries suddenly and permanently removed all of North Africa from the Western world, and over the rest of the period Islamic peoples gradually took over the Byzantine Empire, until the end of the Middle Ages when Catholic Europe, having regained the Iberian peninsula in the southwest, was once again under Muslim threat from the southeast.
At the start of the medieval period most significant works of art were very rare and costly objects associated with secular elites, monasteries or major churches and, if religious, largely produced by monks. By the end of the Middle Ages works of considerable artistic interest could be found in small villages and significant numbers of bourgeois homes in towns, and their production was in many places an important local industry, with artists from the clergy now the exception. However the Rule of St Benedict permitted the sale of works of art by monasteries, and it is clear that throughout the period monks might produce art, including secular works, commercially for a lay market, and monasteries would equally hire lay specialists where necessary.

The impression may be left by the surviving works that almost all medieval art was religious. This is far from the case; though the church became very wealthy over the Middle Ages and was prepared at times to spend lavishly on art, there was also much secular art of equivalent quality which has suffered from a far higher rate of wear and tear, loss and destruction. The Middle Ages generally lacked the concept of preserving older works for their artistic merit, as opposed to their association with a saint or founder figure, and the following periods of the Renaissance and Baroque tended to disparage medieval art. Most luxury illuminated manuscripts of the Early Middle Ages had lavish treasure binding book-covers in precious metal, ivory and jewels; the re-bound pages and ivory reliefs for the covers have survived in far greater numbers than complete covers, which have mostly been stripped off for their valuable materials at some point.
Most churches have been rebuilt, often several times, but medieval palaces and large houses have been lost at a far greater rate, which is also true of their fittings and decoration. In England, churches survive largely intact from every century since the 7th, and in considerable numbers for the later ones—the city of Norwich alone has 40 medieval churches—but of the dozens of royal palaces none survive from earlier than the 11th century, and only a handful of remnants from the rest of the period. The situation is similar in most of Europe, though the 14th century Palais des Papes in Avignon survives largely intact. Many of the longest running scholarly disputes over the date and origin of individual works relate to secular pieces, because they are so much rarer - the Anglo-Saxon Fuller Brooch was refused by the British Museum as an implausible fake, and small free-standing secular bronze sculptures are so rare that the date, origin and even authenticity of both of the two best examples has been argued over for decades.

The use of valuable materials is a constant in medieval art; until the end of the period, far more was typically spent on buying them than on paying the artists, even if these were not monks performing their duties. Gold was used for objects for churches and palaces, personal jewellery and the fittings of clothes, and—fixed to the back of glass tesserae—as a solid background for mosaics, or applied as gold leaf to miniatures in manuscripts and panel paintings. Many objects using precious metals were made in the knowledge that their bullion value might be realised at a future point—only near the end of the period could money be invested other than in real estate, except at great risk or by committing usury.
The even more expensive pigment ultramarine, made from ground lapis lazuli obtainable only from Afghanistan, was used lavishly in the Gothic period, more often for the traditional blue outer mantle of the Virgin Mary than for skies. Ivory, often painted, was an important material until the very end of the period, well illustrating the shift in luxury art to secular works; at the beginning of the period most uses were shifting from consular diptychs to religious objects such as book-covers, reliquaries and croziers, but in the Gothic period secular mirror-cases, caskets and decorated combs become common among the well-off. As thin ivory panels carved in relief could rarely be recycled for another work, the number of survivals is relatively high—the same is true of manuscript pages, although these were often re-cycled by scraping, whereupon they become palimpsests.

Even these basic materials were costly: when the Anglo-Saxon Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey planned to create three copies of the bible in 692—of which one survives as the Codex Amiatinus—the first step necessary was to plan to breed the cattle to supply the 1,600 calves to give the skin for the vellum required.

Paper became available in the last centuries of the period, but was also extremely expensive by today&#x27;s standards; woodcuts sold to ordinary pilgrims at shrines were often matchbook size or smaller. Modern dendrochronology has revealed that most of the oak for panels used in Early Netherlandish painting of the 15th century was felled in the Vistula basin in Poland, from where it was shipped down the river and across the Baltic and North Seas to Flemish ports, before being seasoned for several years.

Art in the Middle Ages is a broad subject and art historians traditionally divide it in several large-scale phases, styles or periods. The period of the Middle Ages neither begins nor ends neatly at any particular date, nor at the same time in all regions, and the same is true for the major phases of art within the period. The major phases are covered in the following sections.

==Early Christian and Late Antique art==

Early Christian art, more generally described as Late Antique art, covers the period from about 200 (before which no distinct Christian art survives), until the onset of a fully Byzantine style in about 500. There continue to be different views as to when the medieval period begins during this time, both in terms of general history and specifically art history, but it is most often placed late in the period. In the course of the 4th century Christianity went from being a persecuted popular sect to the official religion of the Empire, adapting existing Roman styles and often iconography, from both popular and Imperial art. From the start of the period the main survivals of Christian art are the tomb-paintings in popular styles of the catacombs of Rome, but by the end there were a number of lavish mosaics in churches built under Imperial patronage.

Over this period imperial Late Roman art went through a strikingly &quot;baroque&quot; phase, and then largely abandoned classical style and Greek realism in favour of a more mystical and hieratic style—a process that was well underway before Christianity became a major influence on imperial art. Influences from Eastern parts of the Empire—Egypt, Syria and beyond, and also a robust &quot;Italic&quot; vernacular tradition, contributed to this process. 

Figures are mostly seen frontally staring out at the viewer, where classical art tended to show a profile view - the change was eventually seen even on coins. The individuality of portraits, a great strength of Roman art, declines sharply, and the anatomy and drapery of figures is shown with much less realism. The models from which medieval Northern Europe in particular formed its idea of &quot;Roman&quot; style were nearly all portable Late Antique works, and the Late Antique carved sarcophagi found all over the former Roman Empire; the determination to find earlier &quot;purer&quot; classical models, was a key element in the art &quot;all&#x27;antica&quot; of the Renaissance.

==Byzantine art==

Byzantine art is the art of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire formed after the division of the Roman Empire between Eastern and Western halves, and sometimes of parts of Italy under Byzantine rule. It emerges from Late Antiquity in about 500 CE and soon formed a tradition distinct from that of Catholic Europe but with great influence over it. In the early medieval period the best Byzantine art, often from the large Imperial workshops, represented an ideal of sophistication and technique which European patrons tried to emulate. During the period of Byzantine iconoclasm in 730-843 the vast majority of icons (sacred images usually painted on wood) were destroyed; so little remains that today any discovery sheds new understanding, and most remaining works are in Italy (Rome and Ravenna etc.), or Egypt at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery.

Byzantine art was extremely conservative, for religious and cultural reasons, but retained a continuous tradition of Greek realism, which contended with a strong anti-realist and hieratic impulse. After the resumption of icon production in 843 until 1453 the Byzantine art tradition continued with relatively few changes, despite, or because of, the slow decline of the Empire. There was a notable revival of classical style in works of 10th century court art like the Paris Psalter, and throughout the period manuscript illumination shows parallel styles, often used by the same artist, for iconic figures in framed miniatures and more informal small scenes or figures added unframed in the margins of the text in a much more realist style.

Monumental sculpture with figures remained a taboo in Byzantine art; hardly any exceptions are known. But small ivory reliefs, almost all in the iconic mode (the Harbaville Triptych is of similar date to the Paris Psalter, but very different in style), were a speciality, as was relief decoration on bowls and other metal objects.

The Byzantine Empire produced much of the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with court production centred on Constantinople, although some art historians have questioned the assumption, still commonly made, that all work of the best quality with no indication as to origin was produced in the capital. Byzantine art&#x27;s crowning achievement were the monumental frescos and mosaics inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to mosques.
Byzantine art exercised a continuous trickle of influence on Western European art, and the splendours of the Byzantine court and monasteries, even at the end of the Empire, provided a model for Western rulers and secular and clerical patrons. For example, Byzantine silk textiles, often woven or embroidered with designs of both animal and human figures, the former often reflecting traditions originating much further east, were unexcelled in the Christian world until almost the end of the Empire. These were produced, but probably not entirely so, in Imperial workshops in Constantinople, about whose operations we know next to nothing—similar workshops are often conjectured for other arts, with even less evidence. The gold ground style in mosaics, icons and manuscript miniatures was common across Europe by the Gothic period. Some other decorative arts were less developed; Byzantine ceramics rarely rise above the level of attractive folk art, despite the Ancient Greek heritage and the impressive future in the Ottoman period of İznik wares and other types of pottery.

Other local traditions in Armenia, Syria, Georgia and elsewhere showed generally less sophistication, but often more vigour than the art of Constantinople, and sometimes, especially in architecture, seem to have had influence even in Western Europe. For example, figurative monumental sculpture on the outside of churches appears here some centuries before it is seen in the West.

== African Medieval Art ==
Often overlooked in reviews of medieval art are the works of the African continent. Among these are the arts of Egypt, Nubia, and Ethiopia. After the African churches refused the Council of Chalcedon and became the Oriental Orthodox Churches, their art developed in new directions, related to Byzantium but different from it.

Coptic art arose from indigenous Egyptian conceptions, with a non-realist style, often with large-eyed figures floating on unpainted backgrounds. Coptic decoration used intricate geometric designs, which Islamic art later followed. Because of the exceptionally good preservation of Egyptian burials, we know more about the textiles used by the less well-off in Egypt than anywhere else. These were often elaborately decorated with figurative and patterned designs.

Ethiopian art was a vital part of the Aksumite empire, with one important example being the Garima Gospels, among the earliest illustrated biblical manuscripts anywhere. Works about the Virgin Mary were especially likely to be illustrated, as demonstrated by a royal manuscript known as EMML 9002 created at the end of the 1300s. Some of these images of Mary can be viewed at the Princeton Ethiopian, Eritrean and Egyptian Miracles of Mary project.

==Migration Period through Christianisation==

Migration Period art describes the art of the &quot;barbarian&quot; Germanic and Eastern-European peoples who were on the move, and then settling within the former Roman Empire, during the Migration Period from about 300-700; the blanket term covers a wide range of ethnic or regional styles including early Anglo-Saxon art, Visigothic art, Viking art, and Merovingian art, all of which made use of the animal style as well as geometric motifs derived from classical art. By this period the animal style had reached a much more abstracted form than in earlier Scythian art or La Tène style. Most artworks were small and portable and those surviving are mostly jewellery and metalwork, with the art expressed in geometric or schematic designs, often beautifully conceived and made, with few human figures and no attempt at realism. The early Anglo-Saxon grave goods from Sutton Hoo are among the best examples.

As the &quot;barbarian&quot; peoples were Christianised, these influences interacted with the post-classical Mediterranean Christian artistic tradition, and new forms like the illuminated manuscript, and indeed coins, which attempted to emulate Roman provincial coins and Byzantine types. Early coinage like the sceat shows designers completely unused to depicting a head in profile grappling with the problem in a variety of different ways.

As for larger works, there are references to Anglo-Saxon wooden pagan statues, all now lost, and in Norse art the tradition of carved runestones was maintained after their conversion to Christianity. The Celtic Picts of Scotland also carved stones before and after conversion, and the distinctive Anglo-Saxon and Irish tradition of large outdoor carved crosses may reflect earlier pagan works. Viking art from later centuries in Scandinavia and parts of the British Isles includes work from both pagan and Christian backgrounds, and was one of the last flowerings of this broad group of styles.

==Insular art==

Insular art refers to the distinct style found in Ireland and Britain from about the 7th century, to about the 10th century, lasting later in Ireland, and parts of Scotland. The style saw a fusion between the traditions of Celtic art, the Germanic Migration period art of the Anglo-Saxons and the Christian forms of the book, high crosses and liturgical metalwork.

Extremely detailed geometric, interlace, and stylised animal decoration, with forms derived from secular metalwork like brooches, spread boldly across manuscripts, usually gospel books like the Book of Kells, with whole carpet pages devoted to such designs, and the development of the large decorated and historiated initial. There were very few human figures—most often these were Evangelist portraits—and these were crude, even when closely following Late Antique models.

The insular manuscript style was transmitted to the continent by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, and its anti-classical energy was extremely important in the formation of later medieval styles. In most Late Antique manuscripts text and decoration were kept clearly apart, though some initials began to be enlarged and elaborated, but major insular manuscripts sometimes take a whole page for a single initial or the first few words (see illustration) at beginnings of gospels or other sections in a book. Allowing decoration a &quot;right to roam&quot; was to be very influential on Romanesque and Gothic art in all media.

The buildings of the monasteries for which the insular gospel books were made were then small and could fairly be called primitive, especially in Ireland. There increasingly were other decorations to churches, where possible in precious metals, and a handful of these survive, like the Ardagh Chalice, together with a larger number of extremely ornate and finely made pieces of secular high-status jewellery, the Celtic brooches probably worn mainly by men, of which the Tara Brooch is the most spectacular.

&quot;Franco-Saxon&quot; is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The &quot;most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles&quot;, it continued until as late as the 11th century.

Giant initials
==The influence of Islamic art==
Islamic art during the Middle Ages falls outside the scope of this article, but it was widely imported and admired by European elites, and its influence needs mention. Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen. Glass production, for example, remained a Jewish speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in Coptic Egypt continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe. There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards. Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions. Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted tiles, from as early as 862-3 (at the Great Mosque of Kairouan in modern Tunisia), which also spread to Europe. According to John Ruskin, the Doge&#x27;s Palace in Venice contains &quot;three elements in exactly equal proportions — the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world. ... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence&quot;.
Islamic rulers controlled at various points Sicily (Emirate of Sicily) and most of the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus), thus also ruling Christian populations. The Christian Crusaders equally ruled Islamic populations. Crusader art is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the Mozarabic art of Christians in Al Andaluz seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at Moissac in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the lintel above, and also in having &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot; surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their diwan. Calligraphy, ornament and the decorative arts generally were more important than in the West.

The Hispano-Moresque pottery wares of Spain were first produced in Al-Andalus, but Muslim potters then seem to have emigrated to the area of Christian Valencia, where they produced work that was exported to Christian elites across Europe; other types of Islamic luxury goods, notably silk textiles and carpets, came from the generally wealthier eastern Islamic world itself (the Islamic conduits to Europe west of the Nile were, however, not wealthier), with many passing through Venice. However, for the most part luxury products of the court culture such as silks, ivory, precious stones and jewels were imported to Europe only in an unfinished form and manufactured into the end product labelled as &quot;eastern&quot; by local medieval artisans. They were free from depictions of religious scenes and normally decorated with ornament, which made them easy to accept in the West, indeed by the late Middle Ages there was a fashion for pseudo-Kufic imitations of Arabic script used decoratively in Western art.

==Pre-Romanesque art==

&quot;Pre-Romanesque&quot; is a term for architecture and to some extent pictorial and portable art found initially in Southern Europe (Spain, Italy and Southern France) between the Late Antique period to the start of the Romanesque period in the 11th century. Northern European art gradually forms part of the movement after Christianisation as it assimilates post-classical styles. The Carolingian art of the Frankish Empire, especially modern France and Germany, from roughly 780-900 takes its name from Charlemagne and is an art of the court circle and a few monastic centres under Imperial patronage, that consciously sought to revive &quot;Roman&quot; styles and standards as befitted the new Empire of the West. Some centres of Carolingian production also pioneered expressive styles in works like the Utrecht Psalter and Ebbo Gospels. Christian monumental sculpture is recorded for the first time, and depiction of the human figure in narrative scenes became confident for the first time in Northern art. Carolingian architecture produced larger buildings than had been seen since Roman times, and the westwork and other innovations.

After the collapse of the dynasty there was a hiatus before a new dynasty brought a revival in Germany with Ottonian art, again centred on the court and monasteries, with art that moved towards great expressiveness through simple forms that achieve monumentality even in small works like ivory reliefs and manuscript miniatures, above all those of the Reichenau School, such as the Pericopes of Henry II (1002–1012). Later Anglo-Saxon art in England, from about 900, was expressive in a very different way, with agitated figures and even drapery perhaps best shown in the many pen drawings in manuscripts. The Mozarabic art of Christian Spain had strong Islamic influence, and a complete lack of interest in realism in its brilliantly coloured miniatures, where figures are presented as entirely flat patterns. Both of these were to influence the formation in France of the Romanesque style.

==Romanesque art==

Romanesque art developed in the period between about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century, in conjunction with the rise of monasticism in Western Europe. The style developed initially in France, but spread to Christian Spain, England, Flanders, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere to become the first medieval style found all over Europe, though with regional differences. The arrival of the style coincided with a great increase in church-building, and in the size of cathedrals and larger churches; many of these were rebuilt in subsequent periods, but often reached roughly their present size in the Romanesque period. Romanesque architecture is dominated by thick walls, massive structures conceived as a single organic form, with vaulted roofs and round-headed windows and arches.

Figurative sculpture, originally colourfully painted, plays an integral and important part in these buildings, in the capitals of columns, as well as around impressive portals, usually centred on a tympanum above the main doors, as at Vézelay Abbey and Autun Cathedral. Reliefs are much more common than free-standing statues in stone, but Romanesque relief became much higher, with some elements fully detached from the wall behind. Large carvings also became important, especially painted wooden crucifixes like the Gero Cross from the very start of the period, and figures of the Virgin Mary like the Golden Madonna of Essen. Royalty and the higher clergy began to commission life-size effigies for tomb monuments. Some churches had massive pairs of bronze doors decorated with narrative relief panels, like the Gniezno Doors or those at Hildesheim, &quot;the first decorated bronze doors cast in one piece in the West since Roman times&quot;, and arguably the finest before the Renaissance.
Most churches were extensively frescoed; a typical scheme had &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot; at the east (altar) end, a &quot;Last Judgement&quot; at the west end over the doors, and scenes from the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; facing typologically matching Old Testament scenes on the nave walls. The &quot;greatest surviving monument of Romanesque wall painting&quot;, much reduced from what was originally there, is in the Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe near Poitiers, where the rounded barrel vault of the nave, the crypt, portico and other areas retain most of their paintings. An equivalent cycle in Sant&#x27;Angelo in Formis at Capua in southern Italy by Italian painters trained by Greeks illustrates the continuing predominance of Byzantine style in much of Italy.

Romanesque sculpture and painting is often vigorous and expressive, and inventive in terms of iconography—the subjects chosen and their treatment. Though many features absorbed from classical art form part of the Romanesque style, Romanesque artists rarely intended to achieve any sort of classical effect, except perhaps in Mosan art. As art became seen by a wider section of the population, and because of challenges from new heresies, art became more didactic, and the local church the &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Bible&quot;. At the same time grotesque beasts and monsters, and fights with or between them, were popular themes, to which religious meanings might be loosely attached, although this did not impress St Bernard of Clairvaux, who famously denounced such distractions in monasteries:

But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness? Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen? ... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books. He might well have known the miniature at left, which was produced at Cîteaux Abbey before the young Bernard was transferred from there in 1115.

During the period typology became the dominant approach in theological literature and art to interpreting the bible, with Old Testament incidents seen as pre-figurations of aspects of the life of Christ, and shown paired with their corresponding New Testament episode. Often the iconography of the New Testament scene was based on traditions and models originating in Late Antiquity, but the iconography of the Old Testament episode had to be invented in this period, for lack of precedents. New themes such as the Tree of Jesse were devised, and representations of God the Father became more acceptable. The vast majority of surviving art is religious. Mosan art was an especially refined regional style, with much superb metalwork surviving, often combined with enamel, and elements of classicism rare in Romanesque art, as in the Baptismal font at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Liège, or the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne, one of a number of surviving works by Nicholas of Verdun, whose services were sought across north-western Europe.

Stained glass became a significant art-form in the period, though little Romanesque glass survives. In illuminated manuscripts the bible became a new focus of intensive decoration, with the psalter also remaining important. The strong emphasis on the suffering of Christ and other sacred figures entered Western art in this period, a feature that strongly distinguishes it from both Byzantine and classical art for the remainder of the Middle Ages and beyond. The Gero Cross of 965-970, at the cusp of Ottonian and Romanesque art, has been called the first work to exhibit this. The end of the Romanesque period saw the start of the greatly increased emphasis on the Virgin Mary in theology, literature and so also art that was to reach its full extent in the Gothic period.

==Gothic art==
Gothic art is a variable term depending on the craft, place and time. The term originated with the Gothic architecture which developed in France from about 1137 with the rebuilding of the Abbey Church of St Denis. As with Romanesque architecture, this included sculpture as an integral part of the style, with even larger portals and other figures on the facades of churches the location of the most important sculpture, until the late period, when large carved altarpieces and reredos, usually in painted and gilded wood, became an important focus in many churches. Gothic painting did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style. A Gothic style in sculpture originates in France around 1144 and spread throughout Europe, becoming by the 13th century the international style, replacing Romanesque, though in sculpture and painting the transition was not as sharp as in architecture.

The majority of Romanesque cathedrals and large churches were replaced by Gothic buildings, at least in those places benefiting from the economic growth of the period—Romanesque architecture is now best seen in areas that were subsequently relatively depressed, like many southern regions of France and Italy, or northern Spain. The new architecture allowed for much larger windows, and stained glass of a quality never excelled is perhaps the type of art most associated in the popular mind with the Gothic, although churches with nearly all their original glass, like the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, are extremely rare anywhere, and unknown in Britain.

Most Gothic wall-paintings have also disappeared; these remained very common, though in parish churches often rather crudely executed. Secular buildings also often had wall-paintings, although royalty preferred the much more expensive tapestries, which were carried along as they travelled between their many palaces and castles, or taken with them on military campaigns—the finest collection of late-medieval textile art comes from the Swiss booty at the Battle of Nancy, when they defeated and killed Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and captured all his baggage train.
As mentioned in the previous section, the Gothic period coincided with a greatly increased emphasis on the Virgin Mary, and it was in this period that the Virgin and Child became such a hallmark of Catholic art. Saints were also portrayed far more often, and many of the range of attributes developed to identify them visually for a still largely illiterate public first appeared.

During this period panel painting for altarpieces, often polyptyches and smaller works became newly important. Previously icons on panels had been much more common in Byzantine art than in the West, although many now lost panel paintings made in the West are documented from much earlier periods, and initially Western painters on panel were very largely under the sway of Byzantine models, especially in Italy, from where most early Western panel paintings come. The process of establishing a distinct Western style was begun by Cimabue and Duccio, and completed by Giotto, who is traditionally regarded as the starting point for the development of Renaissance painting. Most panel painting remained more conservative than miniature painting however, partly because it was seen by a wide public.
International Gothic describes courtly Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art begins to merge into the Renaissance art that had begun to form itself in Italy during the Trecento, with a return to classical principles of composition and realism, with the sculptor Nicola Pisano and the painter Giotto as especially formative figures. The Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry is one of the best known works of International Gothic. The transition to the Renaissance occurred at different times in different places - Early Netherlandish painting is poised between the two, as is the Italian painter Pisanello. Outside Italy Renaissance styles appeared in some works in courts and some wealthy cities while other works, and all work beyond these centres of innovation, continued late Gothic styles for a period of some decades. The Protestant Reformation often provided an end point for the Gothic tradition in areas that went Protestant, as it was associated with Catholicism.

The invention of a comprehensive mathematically based system of linear perspective is a defining achievement of the early-15th-century Italian Renaissance in Florence, but Gothic painting had already made great progress in the naturalistic depiction of distance and volume, though it did not usually regard them as essential features of a work if other aims conflicted with them, and late Gothic sculpture was increasingly naturalistic. In the mid-15th century Burgundian miniature (right) the artist seems keen to show his skill at representing buildings and blocks of stone obliquely, and managing scenes at different distances. But his general attempt to reduce the size of more distant elements is unsystematic. Sections of the composition are at a similar scale, with relative distance shown by overlapping, foreshortening, and further objects being higher than nearer ones, though the workmen at left do show finer adjustment of size. But this is abandoned on the right where the most important figure is much larger than the mason.
The end of the period includes new media such as prints; along with small panel paintings these were frequently used for the emotive andachtsbilder (&quot;devotional images&quot;) influenced by new religious trends of the period. These were images of moments detached from the narrative of the Passion of Christ designed for meditation on his sufferings, or those of the Virgin: the Man of Sorrows, Pietà, Veil of Veronica or Arma Christi. The trauma of the Black Death in the mid-14th century was at least partly responsible for the popularity of themes such as the &quot;Dance of Death&quot; and &quot;Memento mori&quot;. In the cheap blockbooks with text (often in the vernacular) and images cut in a single woodcut, works such as that illustrated (left), the &quot;Ars Moriendi&quot; (&quot;Art of Dying&quot;) and typological verse summaries of the bible like the &quot;Speculum Humanae Salvationis&quot; (&quot;Mirror of Human Salvation&quot;) were the most popular.

Renaissance Humanism and the rise of a wealthy urban middle class, led by merchants, began to transform the old social context of art, with the revival of realistic portraiture and the appearance of printmaking and the self-portrait, together with the decline of forms like stained glass and the illuminated manuscript. Donor portraits, in the early medieval period largely the preserve of popes, kings and abbots, now showed businessmen and their families, and churches were becoming crowded with the tomb monuments of the well-off.
The book of hours, a type of manuscript normally owned by laymen, or even more often, laywomen, became the type of manuscript most often heavily illustrated from the 14th century onwards, and also by this period, the lead in producing miniatures had passed to lay artists, also very often women. In the most important centres of illumination, Paris and in the 15th century the cities of Flanders, there were large workshops, exporting to other parts of Europe. Other forms of art, such as small ivory reliefs, stained glass, tapestries and Nottingham alabasters (cheap carved panels for altarpieces) were produced in similar conditions, and artists and craftsmen in cities were usually covered by the guild system—the goldsmith&#x27;s guild was typically among the richest in a city, and painters were members of a special Guild of St Luke in many places.

Secular works, often using subjects concerned with courtly love or knightly heroism, were produced as illuminated manuscripts, carved ivory mirror-cases, tapestries and elaborate gold table centrepieces like nefs. It begins to be possible to distinguish much greater numbers of individual artists, some of whom had international reputations. Art collectors begin to appear, of manuscripts among the great nobles, like John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) and of prints and other works among those with moderate wealth. In the wealthier areas tiny cheap religious woodcuts brought art in an approximation of the latest style even into the homes of peasants by the late 15th century.

==Subsequent reputation==
Medieval art had little sense of its own art history, and this disinterest was continued in later periods. The Renaissance generally dismissed it as a &quot;barbarous&quot; product of the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, and the term &quot;Gothic&quot; was invented as a deliberately pejorative one, first used by the painter Raphael in a letter of 1519 to characterise all that had come between the demise of Classical art and its supposed &#x27;rebirth&#x27; in the Renaissance. The term was subsequently adopted and popularised in the mid 16th century by the Florentine artist and historian, Giorgio Vasari, who used it to denigrate northern European architecture generally. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be collected by antiquarians, or sit unregarded in monastic or royal libraries, but paintings were mostly of interest if they had historical associations with royalty or others. The long period of mistreatment of the Westminster Retable by Westminster Abbey is an example; until the 19th century it was only regarded as a useful piece of timber. But their large portrait of Richard II of England was well looked after, like another portrait of Richard, the Wilton Diptych (illustrated above). As in the Middle Ages themselves, other objects have often survived mainly because they were considered to be relics.

There was no equivalent for pictorial art of the &quot;Gothic survival&quot; found in architecture, once the style had finally died off in Germany, England and Scandinavia, and the Gothic Revival long focused on Gothic Architecture rather than art. The understanding of the succession of styles was still very weak, as suggested by the title of Thomas Rickman&#x27;s pioneering book on English architecture: &quot;An Attempt to discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation&quot; (1817). This began to change with a vengeance by the mid-19th century, as appreciation of medieval sculpture and its painting, known as Italian or Flemish &quot;Primitives&quot;, became fashionable under the influence of writers including John Ruskin, Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, and Pugin, as well as the romantic medievalism of literary works like Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1819) and Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (1831). Early collectors of the &quot;Primitives&quot;, then still relatively cheap, included Prince Albert.
Among artists the German Nazarene movement from 1809 and English Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood from 1848 both rejected the values of at least the later Renaissance, but in practice, and despite sometimes depicting medieval scenes, their work draws its influences mostly from the Early Renaissance rather than the Gothic or earlier periods - the early graphic work of John Millais being something of an exception. William Morris, also a discriminating collector of medieval art, absorbed medieval style more thoroughly into his work, as did William Burges.By the later 19th century many book-illustrators and producers of decorative art of various kinds had learned to use medieval styles successfully from the new museums like the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum set up for this purpose. At the same time the new academic field of art history, dominated by Germany and France, concentrated heavily on medieval art and was soon very productive in cataloguing and dating the surviving works, and analysing the development of medieval styles and iconography; though the Late Antique and pre-Carolingian period remained a less explored &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot; until the 20th century.

Franz Theodor Kugler was the first to name and describe Carolingian art in 1837; like many art historians of the period he sought to find and promote the national spirit of his own nation in art history, a search begun by Johann Gottfried Herder in the 18th century. Kugler&#x27;s pupil, the great Swiss art historian Jacob Burckhardt, though he could not be called a specialist in medieval art, was an important figure in developing the understanding of it. Medieval art was now heavily collected, both by museums and private collectors like George Salting, the Rothschild family and John Pierpont Morgan.

After the decline of the Gothic Revival, and the Celtic Revival use of Insular styles, the anti-realist and expressive elements of medieval art have still proved an inspiration for many modern artists.

German-speaking art historians continued to dominate medieval art history, despite figures like Émile Mâle (1862–1954) and Henri Focillon (1881–1943), until the Nazi period, when a large number of important figures emigrated, mostly to Britain or America, where the academic study of art history was still developing. These included the elderly Adolph Goldschmidt and younger figures including Nikolaus Pevsner, Ernst Kitzinger, Erwin Panofsky, Kurt Weitzmann, Richard Krautheimer and many others. Meyer Schapiro had immigrated as a child in 1907.

==Jewish portrayals in medieval Christian art==

The great majority of narrative religious medieval art depicted events from the Bible, where the majority of persons shown had been Jewish. But the extent to which this was emphasised in their depictions varied greatly. During the Middle Ages some Christian art was used as a way to express prejudices and commonly held negative views.

In medieval Europe between the 5th and 15th century, many Christians viewed Jews as enemies and outsiders due to a variety of factors. They also tended to hate them for being both culturally and religiously different as well as because of religious teachings that held negative views of Jewish people such as portrayals of the Antichrist as Jewish. The Jewish people&#x27;s economic position as moneylenders, coupled with royal protections that were given to them, created a strained relationship between Jews and Christians. This strain manifested itself in several ways, one of which was through the creation of antisemitic and anti-Judaism art and propaganda that served the purpose of discrediting both Jews and their religious beliefs as well as spreading these beliefs even further into society. Late medieval images of Ecclesia and Synagoga represented the Christian doctrine of supersessionism, whereby the Christian New Covenant had replaced the Jewish Mosaic covenant Sara Lipton has argued that some portrayals, such as depictions of Jewish blindness in the presence of Jesus, were meant to serve as a form of self-reflection rather than be explicitly anti-Semitic.
In her 2013 book &quot;Saracens, Demons, and Jews&quot;, Debra Higgs Strickland argues that negative portrayals of Jews in medieval art can be divided into three categories: art that focused on physical descriptions, art that featured signs of damnation, and images that depicted Jews as monsters. Physical depictions of Jewish people in medieval Christian art were often men with pointed Jewish hats and long beards, which was done as a derogatory symbol and to separate Jews from Christians in a clear manner. This portrayal would grow more virulent over time, however Jewish women lacked similar distinctive physical descriptions in high medieval Christian art. Art that depicted Jewish people in scenes that featured signs of damnation is believed to have stemmed from the Christian belief that Jews were responsible for the murder of Christ, which has led to some artistic representations featured Jews crucifying Christ. 

Jewish people were sometimes seen as outsiders in Christian dominated societies, which Strickland states developed into the belief that Jews were barbarians, which eventually expanded into the idea that Jewish people were monsters that rejected the &quot;True Faith&quot;. Some art from this time period combined these concepts and morphed the stereotypical Jewish beard and pointed hat imagery with that of monsters, creating art that made the Jew synonymous with a monster.

The reasons for these negative depictions of Jews can be traced back to many sources, but mainly stem from the Jews being charged with deicide, their religious and cultural differences from their cultural neighbours, and how the antichrist was often depicted as Jewish in medieval writings and texts. The Jews were recently blamed for the death of Christ and were thus negatively depicted by the Christians in both art and scripture alike. 

Tensions between Jews and Christians were often high and this caused various stereotypes about Jews to form and become commonplace in their artistic depiction. Some of the attributes seen distinguishing Jews from their Christian counterparts in pieces of art are pointed hats, hooked and crooked noses, and long beards. By including these attributes in the portrayal of Jews in art, Christians succeeded in &#x27;othering&#x27; Jews more than they already were and made them seem even more ostracised and segregated from the general population than they already were. Not only were these attributes added into depictions of Jewish People, they were generally portrayed as villainous and monstrous because of their supposed murder of Christ as well their rejection of Christ as the messiah. This, coupled with the fact that they lived in largely insular groups separated them greatly from their Christian neighbours and caused a lasting rift between the groups that are reflected in the medieval art.

<text>Sucha Beskidzka (before 1961 called only &quot;Sucha&quot;) is a town in the Żywiec Beskids mountain range in southern Poland, on the Skawa river. It is the county seat of Sucha County. It has been in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship since 1999; previously it was in Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship (1975–1998).

== Location ==
Sucha Beskidzka lies in a basin, between the hills of the Beskids (Beskid Makowski and Beskid Maly), on the Skawa river. In 2002, Sucha had the area of 27,46 km2., with forests occupying 44%. The town is a rail junction, located along two lines – the 97th from Skawina to Żywiec, and the 98th from Sucha Beskidzka to Chabowka. The rail station PKP Sucha Beskidzka, together with a roundhouse was built in the 1880s.

Until 1964, the town was called Sucha. The adjective Beskidzka, added in that year, refers to the Beskidy Mountains.

==History==
In the late Middle Ages, the area of Sucha Beskidzka belonged to Duchy of Oświęcim. In the early years of the 15th century, Prince Jan III of Oświęcim initiated a program of settlement of the sparsely populated forested areas in the Beskids. In 1405, a man named Strzala was allowed to found a settlement, which later took on the name Sucha. Most likely, the Strzala family remained owners of the settlement until the late 15th century, when Sucha was transferred into the hands of the Słupski family. In 1554, Stanisław Słupski sold the village to an Italian-born goldsmith from Kraków, Gaspare Castiglione, who changed his name to Kasper Suski. Castiglione initiated the construction of the Sucha Castle.

In the early 17th century Sucha belonged to the Komorowski family. The village remained in private hands until 1939, as the so-called &quot;Sucha State&quot; (). Among its owners were the Wielopolski family, the Branicki family, and the Tarnowski family. In the 1610s, Piotr Komorowski funded here a parish church, and vastly expanded the castle of Kasper Suski, turning it into a residence. Furthermore, Sucha was a center of early industry, with glass works, watermill, brewery, and iron works. Due to several royal privileges, Sucha emerged as a local trade center; the village prospered under Anna Konstancja Wielopolska, who owned it in 1693 – 1726. The area of Sucha was one of centers of the Bar Confederation, and in 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), the village, with the population of 3,000, became part of Austrian-Hungarian province of Galicia.

In the 1840s, Sucha was purchased by the Branicki family, Korczak coat of arms, which opened a large library together with a museum in the Sucha Castle. The village already had ironworks, which operated until the 1880s. In the same period, Sucha received a rail station, along the Galician Transversal Railway. Here, a northwards connection with Kraków was added in 1884, after which Sucha became an important rail junction. In 1896 Austrian authorities finally granted town charter to Sucha. In 1895 – 1907, a new church was built, and in 1910, new building of Bank Spółdzielczy. In the Second Polish Republic, Sucha belonged to Kraków Voivodeship, and was part of Żywiec County (later the town was transferred to Wadowice County). In 1922–1939, the castle belonged to the Tarnowski family. In 1939, population of the town was 6,200.

On September 3, 1939 (see Invasion of Poland), Sucha was captured by the Wehrmacht. In late 1939, the town was annexed by the Third Reich, and was located near the border with the General Government. Jews, of whom there were about 500 in the town, were immediately put to work as forced laborers. Many Poles were dispossessed of their homes to make room for ethnic Germans who arrived in town from the east. In June 1942, more than 200 Jews were rounded up and sent to Auschwitz, where most of them were murdered. The remaining 300 Jews were forced into a ghetto in an old brewery. Many worked as forced laborers to improve flood control along the Skawa River. In May 1943, about half the remaining Jews were sent to Auschwitz where most were murdered. The rest were sent to labor camps.

After the war, the government of People&#x27;s Republic of Poland again attached Sucha to Kraków Voivodeship. New districts with blocks of flats were built, new factories were opened. In 1956, for the first time in history, Sucha became the seat of a county, and in 1975, the town became part of Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship. In 1983, the new hospital was completed.

== Attractions ==
Since the beginning of the 20th century Sucha Beskidzka has been a tourist centre for the Beskidy Mountains (part of the Carpathians). Here several tourist trails begin, which lead into the mountains. First trail was marked in 1906. In the town there are fine examples of old architecture: a Renaissance castle (16th century), named &quot;Little Wawel&quot; after the royal palace in Kraków (now it serves as a hotel with a restaurant), a church with a cloister (17th century) and an old wooden inn, called &quot;Rzym&quot; (literally meaning &quot;Rome&quot;; 18th century).

==Education==
In the town, there are two higher education schools: 
* The Foreign Language Teacher Training College (&quot;Nauczycielskie Kolegium Języków Obcych&quot;, NKJO )
* The Higher School of Tourism and Ecology (&quot;Wyższa Szkoła Turystyki i Ekologii&quot;, WSTiE)

<doc id="340036" wikidata="Q932475" url="?curid=340036" title="Masada (band)">
<text>Masada is a musical group with rotating personnel led by American saxophonist and composer John Zorn since the early 1990s.

Masada was the first ensemble to perform Zorn&#x27;s compositions inspired by Radical Jewish Culture and written to be performed by small groups of musicians. Initially envisioned as a set of 100 &quot;songs&quot; notated within a limited number of staves and confined to specific modes or scales, Zorn&#x27;s Masada project would eventually total 613 compositions divided into three specific &quot;books&quot;.

Zorn used Hebrew titles for these compositions along with melodic themes and musical structures reminiscent of klezmer music, and Jewish imagery on album covers to explore Jewish identity within the Masada songbook and groups. He stated: &quot;The idea with Masada is to produce a sort of radical Jewish music, a new Jewish music which is not the traditional one in a different arrangement, but music for the Jews of today. The idea is to put Ornette Coleman and the Jewish scales together.&quot;

== History ==
In 1993 Zorn first worked with Dave Douglas (trumpet), Greg Cohen (double bass), and Joey Baron (drums) to provide musical cues for Joe Chappelle&#x27;s first film &quot;Thieves Quartet&quot; (later collected on &quot;Filmworks III: 1990–1995&quot;) and established them as Masada to perform his recent compositions using the instrumental lineup and improvisational approach of Ornette Coleman&#x27;s pioneering free jazz quartet.

From 1994 the group released ten studio albums on the Japanese DIW label, each titled after a letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Further releases by Masada on Tzadik highlighted live performances recorded in Jerusalem (1994), Taipei (1995), Middelheim (1999), Seville (2000) and in New York at the Knitting Factory (1993) and at Tonic (2001). The quartet released a live DVD in 1999, another recording from Zorn&#x27;s 50th Birthday Celebration Series and a double CD of unreleased studio recordings, &quot;Sanhedrin 1994–1997&quot; in 2005.

By the end of 2004, Zorn had composed over 300 new tunes for the &quot;second&quot; Masada songbook. Some of the new tunes were debuted at Tonic in December 2004, as a mini festival. Tzadik has released a series of CDs of these songs played by various ensembles, including the Masada String Trio, Marc Ribot, Koby Israelite, Erik Friedlander and others as the &quot;Masada Book 2: The Book of Angels&quot; collection.

As of early 2007, according to the Tzadik website, &quot;Together for close to fifteen years, John Zorn&#x27;s Masada Quartet is officially breaking up and will be performing two of their last live concerts ever at Lincoln Center March 9th and 10th on a double bill with Cecil Taylor&#x27;s New AHA 3.&quot; Nevertheless, they were scheduled to perform as the original quartet on a concert in Antwerp in Cultural Center Luchtbal on June 22, 2008 - the bill later changed with the addition of pianist Uri Caine, who performed with them the entire set, except for one song. Baron, Cohen and Douglas also joined the duo of Mike Patton and John Zorn the evening before, at the same venue, and the quartet also performed one song as an encore.

The quartet performed together at Yoshi&#x27;s San Francisco jazz club on March 12, 2008. The 8pm show featured music from the original Masada songbook and the 10pm performance featured songs from &quot;Masada Book 2: The Book of Angels&quot;.

== Related projects ==
Since the mid-1990s a number of new projects have arisen under the Masada banner.

===Masada String Trio===
The Masada String Trio performs selections from the Masada songbook in a classical-chamber jazz form. Personnel include Mark Feldman (violin), Erik Friedlander (cello), and Cohen (bass). With the addition of Marc Ribot (guitar), Cyro Baptista (percussion) and Joey Baron (drums), this same group has performed as the &quot;Bar Kokhba Sextet&quot;.

The performing style of both groups is characterised by the use of improvisation (sometimes conducted by Zorn himself) and its use of the inflections of Jewish music that are part of the compositional language of Zorn&#x27;s &quot;Masada&quot; themes.

===Bar Kokhba===

Two different projects in the Masada family share this name. Prior to the creation of the Bar Kokhba Sextet, the &quot;Bar Kokhba&quot; album was released, featuring a cast of regular Zorn collaborators performing Masada material in a variety of different small ensemble configurations.

===Electric Masada===
One of Zorn&#x27;s most active Masada projects of recent years is Electric Masada. Drawing on Zorn&#x27;s wide-ranging stylistic influences, the band takes the Masada songbook into a whole new direction, reminiscent of jazz fusion and noise rock. The group, which includes Baron, Ribot, Wollesen, and Cyro Baptista, from previous Masada groups, as well as Trevor Dunn on bass, Jamie Saft on keyboards and Ikue Mori on laptop/electronics, continue to take the Masada themes and transform them into something entirely new.

Zorn uses hand signals to conduct the band, allowing for him to make up different arrangements on the spot. During Zorn&#x27;s 50th Birthday Celebration at Tonic in September 2003, Electric Masada was recorded live. Released in May 2004, &quot;50th Birthday Celebration Volume 4&quot; became the group&#x27;s first official recording. This was followed by &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; recorded in 2004 in Moscow and Ljubljana.

=== New Masada Quartet ===
In 2019, Zorn formed the New Masada Quartet with Julian Lage (guitar), Jorge Roeder (bass), and Kenny Wollesen (drums).

== 10th Anniversary ==
2003 saw the 10th Anniversary of Masada and Tzadik released five new CD sets in commemoration. The first release, &quot;Masada Guitars&quot;, has three guitarists, Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot and Tim Sparks, playing the tunes, mainly acoustically. Volume 2, &quot;Voices in the Wilderness&quot;, has a huge range of groups and individuals playing and Volume 3, &quot;The Unknown Masada&quot;, has yet more new groups, together with some familiar faces playing Masada tunes never before performed in public. A fourth volume, &quot;Masada Recital&quot;, performed by Sylvie Courvoisier on piano and Mark Feldman on violin, followed in 2004. The fifth and final volume &quot;Masada Rock&quot; features the band Rashanim and was released in August 2005.

== Masada Book 2: The Book of Angels ==
From 2003 Zorn has written a range of new Masada compositions which have been released on a series of albums under the banner of &quot;Masada Book 2: The Book of Angels&quot;. Musicians contributing to the series include Jamie Saft, Masada String Trio, Mark Feldman and Sylvie Courvoisier, Koby Israelite, The Cracow Klezmer Band, Uri Caine, Marc Ribot, Erik Friedlander, the Secret Chiefs 3 the Bar Kokhba Sextet, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, Pat Metheny, &#x27;The Spike Orchestra&#x27; (a big band) arranged by Sam Eastmond &amp; Nikki Franklin, and most recently in 2016, Flaga (a piano trio)

== Masada Book 3: The Book Beriah ==
On March 19, 2014, the first 20 compositions of a third Masada book were performed live at &quot;The Town Hall&quot; in New York. The total number of compositions in the third book is 92, which brings the total number of Masada compositions at 613, the same as the number of mitsvah or commandments in the Torah. Musical group compositions range from loud avant-garde rock to string quartet.

<doc id="340037" wikidata="Q636627" url="?curid=340037" title="Whitchurch, Shropshire">
<text>Whitchurch is a market town in the north of Shropshire, England. It lies east of the Welsh border, 2 miles south of the Cheshire border, north of the county town of Shrewsbury, south of Chester, and east of Wrexham. At the 2021 census, the population of the Whitchurch Urban parish was 10,141, and the population of the Whitchurch built up area was 9,855. Whitchurch is the oldest continuously inhabited town in Shropshire. Notable people who have lived in Whitchurch include the composer Sir Edward German, and illustrator Randolph Caldecott.

==History==
===Early times===
There is evidence from various discovered artefacts that people lived in this area about 3,000 BC. Flakes of flint from the Neolithic era were found in nearby Dearnford Farm.

===Roman times===
Originally a settlement founded by the Romans about AD 52–70 called Mediolanum ( &quot;Midfield&quot; or &quot;Middle of the Plain&quot;), it stood on a major Roman road between Chester and Wroxeter. It was listed on the Antonine Itinerary but is not the Mediolanum of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, which was in central Wales. Local Roman artefacts can be seen at the Whitchurch Heritage Centre.

In 2016, archaeologists discovered the remains of a Roman wooden trackway, a number of structural timbers, a large amount of Roman pottery and fifteen leather shoes during work on a culvert in Whitchurch. In 2018, a collection of 37 small Roman coins was unearthed at Hollyhurst near Whitchurch. The small denomination, brass or copper alloy coins, known as Dupondii and Asses, were from the reign of the Emperor Trajan, AD 98–117. Some dated back to between AD 69–79 from the time of Emperor Vespasian.
=== Anglo-Saxon times ===
Certain sources suggest that St. Alkmund, the son of Alhred, King of Northumbria (d. c. 800) was first buried in Whitchurch; he was certainly first buried in Shropshire. 

It has been suggested that Whitchurch is &quot;Weardbyrig&quot;, which is the site of a Saxon Burh of Æthelflæd, daughter of Alfred the Great Lady of the Mercians which would have been operational in the early 900s CE.

===Norman and Medieval ===
In 1066, Whitchurch was called Westune (&#x27;west farmstead&#x27;), probably for its location on the western edge of Shropshire, bordering the north Welsh Marches. Before the Norman conquest of England, the area had been held by Harold Godwinson. After the conquest, Whitchurch&#x27;s location on the marches would require the Lords of Whitchurch to engage in military activity. 

By the time it was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086), Whitchurch was held by William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, and Roger de Montgomery. It was part of the hundred of Hodnet. There was a castle at Whitchurch, possibly built by the same Earl of Surrey, which would predate the birth of Ralph. The Domesday Book estimates that the property was worth £10 annually, having been worth £8 in the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066).

The surrounding hamlets became townships and Dodtune (&#x27;the settlement of Dodda&#x27;s people&#x27;) is now fully integrated into Whitchurch as Dodington. The first church was built on the hill in AD 912. After the Norman Conquest a motte and bailey castle and a new white Grinshill stone church were built. Westune became Album Monasterium (&#x27;White Church&#x27;). The name Whitchurch is from the Middle English for &quot;White Church&quot;, referring to a church constructed of white stone in the Norman period. The area was also known as Album Monasterium and Blancminster, and the Warennes of Whitchurch were often surnamed de Albo Monasterio in contemporary writings. It is supposed that the church was built by William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey.

During the reign of Henry I in the 12th century, Whitchurch was in the North Division of Bradford Hundred which by the 1820s was referred to as North Bradford Hundred. William fitz Ranulf is the earliest individual of the Warenne family recorded as the Lord of Whitchurch, Shropshire, first appearing in the Shropshire Pipe Roll of 1176. In 1859, Robert Eyton considered it likely that Ralph, son of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, was the father of William and that he first held that title. However, other theories have been put forward.

In 1377 the Whitchurch estates passed to the Talbot family. It was sold by the Talbots to Thomas Egerton, from whom it passed to the earls of Bridgwater and eventually to Earl Brownlow. 
After the Battle of Shrewsbury, the body of Hotspur was taken by Thomas Neville, 5th Baron Furnivall, to Whitchurch for burial. However, when rumours circulated that Percy was still alive, the king &quot;had the corpse exhumed and displayed it, propped upright between two millstones, in the market place at Shrewsbury&quot;.

The town was granted market status in the 14th century. 

===Eighteenth century onwards===
In the 18th Century many of the earlier timber-framed buildings were refaced in the more fashionable brick. New elegant Georgian houses were built at the southern end of the High Street and in Dodington.

The replacement third church collapsed in July 1711 and the present Queen Anne parish church of St Alkmund was immediately constructed to take its place. It was consecrated in 1713.

As dairy farming became more profitable Whitchurch developed as a centre for Cheshire cheese production. Cheese fairs were held on every third Wednesday when farm cheeses were brought into town for sale. Cheese and other goods could be easily transported to wider markets when the Whitchurch Arm of Thomas Telford&#x27;s Llangollen Canal was opened in 1811. The railway station was opened in 1858 on the first railway line in North Shropshire, running from Crewe to Shrewsbury.

During the Second World War a secret Y station for enemy signals interception operated in Whitchurch at the Old Rectory in Claypit Street, run by the Foreign Office.

On 23 November 1981, an F1/T2 tornado passed through Whitchurch as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. The Whitchurch tornado was the longest-lived tornado of the entire outbreak, having first touched down 35 miles away in the south Shropshire village of Norbury. After passing through Whitchurch, the tornado dissipated.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Whitchurch, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Whitchurch Town Council and Shropshire Council. Since 2024, the town council has been based at a temporary town hall and community hub in the former police station at 2 Station Road, after structural problems were identified at Whitchurch Civic Centre.

The town is located within the North Shropshire parliamentary constituency.

===Administrative history===
Whitchurch was an ancient parish, which straddled the North Bradford hundred of Shropshire and the Nantwich hundred of Cheshire. The parish was subdivided into fourteen townships, being Alkington, Ash Magna, Ash Parva, Black Park, Broughall, Dodington, Edgeley, Hinton, Hollyhurst and Chinnel, New Woodhouse, Old Woodhouse, Tilstock, Wirswall, and a Whitchurch township covering the town itself. The Wirswall township was in Cheshire; the rest of the parish was in Shropshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, the civil functions were exercised by subdivisions of the parish rather than the parish as a whole. In the case of Whitchurch, the parish was split into two parts for administering the poor laws: the Cheshire township of Wirswall, and the rest of the parish in Shropshire. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Wirswall and Whitchurch became separate civil parishes.

In 1860, a local government district called Whitchurch and Dodington was created covering those two townships, administered by an elected local board. Under the Local Government Act 1894, such districts were reconstituted as urban districts. Shortly afterwards, in January 1895, the name of the urban district was changed from Whitchurch and Dodington to Whitchurch. The 1894 Act also directed that civil parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so the parish of Whitchurch was split into a Whitchurch Urban parish matching the urban district and a Whitchurch Rural parish outside the urban district. At the 1891 census (the last one before the parish was split into urban and rural parishes) the civil parish had a population of 6,647.

Whitchurch Urban District was abolished in 1967, when its area was redesignated as a rural parish (but retaining the name &#x27;Whitchurch Urban&#x27;) and placed in the new North Shropshire Rural District. The rural district was replaced by the larger North Shropshire district in 1974. That district was in turn abolished in 2009. Shropshire County Council then took over district-level functions, making it a unitary authority, and was renamed Shropshire Council. The civil parish covering the town is still officially called Whitchurch Urban, but its parish council omits the &#x27;urban&#x27; from its name, calling itself Whitchurch Town Council.

==Landmarks==

===Buildings===
There are currently over 100 listed buildings in Whitchurch, including the churches detailed in the religion section lower down.

St Alkmund&#x27;s Church (rebuilt 1712–13) is a prominent landmark in the town and a Grade I listed building. Other notable landmarks include the former almhouses founded by Samuel Higginson (1697) and the former girls&#x27; school founded by Jane Higginson (1708) and the old Whitchurch Grammar School which was founded in 1548. The grammar school building dates from 1708 (Grade II listed) and was latterly used as an infants&#x27; school. Further buildings were added in 1848 and 1926. All have now been converted into flats.

Two of the oldest buildings in Whitchurch include the Old Eagles pub built in the 16th century and 17, 19 and 21 Watergate Street, otherwise known as Raven Yard Antiques. The properties 17, 19 and 21 Watergate were first built in 1625 and were called the Raven&#x27;s Inn. Over the last four centuries, the Raven&#x27;s Inn has seen a great deal of alteration but more recently has seen a significant part of the property restored to its original half timbered facade. 17-19 Watergate exists as a private property and 21 Watergate is now called Raven Yard Antiques, a family owned antiques business with a speciality in Victorian military uniforms.

===Streets===
The street names in the town centre reflect the changing history of the town.
* Roman: Pepper Street, a common name in former Roman settlements. It is a derivation of the Roman Via Piperatica, the street on which pepper and spices were sold.
* Norse: Several streets end in &#x27;gate&#x27; which is Norse for street (e.g., Watergate, Highgate, Bargates). Watergate Street being named after the old Medieval or Roman Watergate which used to exist. Others refer to the castle which was located here (e.g., Castle Hill or Yardington referring to the castle yard).
* Modern: Some refer to local industry (e.g., Claypit Street, clay was used for making bricks; Mill Street, named after the local water mill; and Bark Hill, bark was used for tanning.

===Place names===
The areas of Whitchurch have interesting names. These include:
* &quot;Dodington&quot; – this is derived from &quot;Dodtune&quot; (the settlement of the people of Dodda – a local Anglo-Saxon chieftain)
* &quot;Chemistry&quot; – this is derived from an oak-acid making business located nearby which was used in the tanning industry in the town

==Transport==
===Roads===
Whitchurch is a primary destination on the British road network, signed from as far away as Warrington on the A49, and Wolverhampton on the A41. The bypass around the town shared by both roads opened in 1992. Whitchurch also has roads to Wrexham, Nantwich, Chester, Shrewsbury and Newcastle-under-Lyme. There are bus services from Whitchurch to surrounding settlements including Chester, Nantwich, Wrexham and Shrewsbury.

===Railway===
Whitchurch railway station is on the former London and North Western (later part of the LMS) line from Crewe down the English side of the Welsh border (the Welsh Marches Line) toward Cardiff. However, Whitchurch was once the junction for the main line of the Cambrian Railways, but the section from Whitchurch to Welshpool (Buttington Junction), via Ellesmere, Whittington, Oswestry and Llanymynech, closed on 18 January 1965 in favour of the more viable alternative route via Shrewsbury. Whitchurch was also the junction for the Whitchurch and Tattenhall Railway or Chester to Whitchurch branch line, another part of the London and North Western, running via Malpas. The line closed to regular services on 16 September 1957, but use by diverted passenger trains continued until 8 December 1963.

===Canals===
Whitchurch has its own short arm of the Llangollen Canal and the town centre can be reached by a walk of approximately 1 mile along the Whitchurch Waterways Country Park, the last stage of the Sandstone Trail. The Whitchurch Arm is managed by a charity group of local volunteers.

==Economy==
Historically the town has been the centre of cheese-making. Today Belton Cheese continues to be a major employer. It has been in existence since 1922.

The major employer in the town now is Grocontinental, a logistics provider to the food industry, which employs over 350 people. This family firm which was established in 1941 was taken over by the Dutch multinational AGRO Merchants in 2017, which was then subsequently sold to Americold in December 2020, for a reported $1.74 billion

The town also provides a range of services for the surrounding countryside of the North Shropshire Plain. The majority of retail stores in Whitchurch are small to medium-sized businesses concentrated in the High Street, Watergate street and Green End. There is a Tesco supermarket in the town centre (White Lion Meadow), a smaller Lidl store and a larger Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket in London Road. An Aldi store opened on the edge of town in 2020.

The town was the home of the J. B. Joyce tower clocks company, established in 1690, the earliest tower clock-making company in the world, which earned Whitchurch a reputation as the home of tower clocks. Joyce&#x27;s timepieces can be found as far afield as Singapore, Kabul and Cape Town (see right). The firm also helped to build Big Ben in London. However, J. B. Joyce have now left and an auction house has moved into the building. Whitchurch also has a local chamber of commerce recently retitled as the Whitchurch Business Group, an organisation setup with the aim of improving the town&#x27;s business environment.

By rail Whitchurch is within commuting distance of Liverpool and Manchester (both about one hour north) and Shrewsbury (30 minutes south).

The town&#x27;s most prominent place of worship is St Alkmund&#x27;s Church of England parish church, built in 1712 of red sandstone on the site of a Norman church. It is a Grade I listed building. St Catherine&#x27;s in Dodington was built in 1836 as a chapel of ease for St Alkmund&#x27;s, which at that time was over-crowded. It is Grade II listed, but ceased to be used for worship in the 1970s. It featured in the 1995 BBC &quot;One Foot in the Past&quot; programme, when it was being used as a builder&#x27;s store. It has now been converted into apartments.

<doc id="340039" wikidata="Q385658" url="?curid=340039" title="List of political parties in New Zealand">
<text>New Zealand politics have featured a strong party system since the early 20th century. Usually, all members of Parliament&#x27;s unicameral House of Representatives belong to a political party.

The centre-left New Zealand Labour Party and the centre-right New Zealand National Party are New Zealand&#x27;s two major parties, having jointly contested each election since 1938; they are the only two New Zealand political parties to have won the in four consecutive elections twice. Labour won the popular vote from the 1938 election through to 1946 and again from 1978 through to 1987 – although during the latter period National twice disproportionately gained a majority of seats. Likewise, National won the popular vote from 1960 through to 1969, and then again from 2008 through to 2017, but in the final year could not form a coalition government under proportional representation. 

The introduction of the mixed-member proportional system in 1996 led to a multi-party system, such that smaller parties have substantial representation in Parliament and can now reasonably expect to gain seats in government. , six parties have members in the 54th Parliament.

==History==

New Zealand&#x27;s party system did not arise until the late 19th century. Before this, members of Parliament (MPs) stood as independent candidates, and while some MPs joined factions, these typically were formed around prominent individuals such as Julius Vogel, and did so after an election, not before.

The Liberal Party, which was formed in 1891, was New Zealand&#x27;s first &#x27;modern&#x27; political party. It was the country&#x27;s sole political party until the formation of the more conservative Reform Party in 1909. The Labour Party was founded in 1916, and by 1919 these three parties dominated New Zealand politics.

The Liberal Party was succeeded by the United Party in 1928. The United and Reform parties found themselves working together more often, and they formed a coalition in 1931. After Labour won office in 1935, United and Reform formally amalgamated in 1936 to form the National Party. The first-past-the-post (FPP) plurality voting system (in use before the 1990s) entrenched a two-party system, since the two major parties usually won far more seats than their share of the overall vote.

Over the years, a number of third parties or so-called minor parties developed, notably the Social Credit Party, the New Zealand Party, the Values Party, and the Alliance. However, the FPP electoral system meant that regardless of how many votes a party gained nationwide, it could not win a seat without a plurality in a particular electorate. For example, the Social Credit Party won over 11% of the votes cast in the 1954 election but did not have a plurality in any electorate so won no seats. Similarly, in the 1984 election, the New Zealand Party received over 12% of the votes cast but also won no seats. Under such conditions, minor parties mostly performed poorly in terms of making an impact in Parliament.

In 1993, the Electoral Act 1993 was passed, introducing the mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system for the 1996 election. Now, voters cast both a party vote and an electorate vote. Any party that won at least 5% of the party vote entered Parliament, as could still enter through the previous electorate pathway. This made it much easier for smaller parties to enter Parliament, but more difficult to gain elected as a non-party independent.

In the late 1990s a phenomenon originated in New Zealand&#x27;s multi-party system in which MPs sitting in Parliament increasingly switched parties (or formed breakway parties), known as &quot;waka-jumping&quot;. This is now disallowed to maintain the integrity of the party-based proportional representation.

==Registration of parties==
Political parties in New Zealand can be either registered or unregistered. Registered parties must have five-hundred paying members, each eligible to vote in general elections, and party membership rules.

If a party registers, it may submit a party list, enabling it to receive party votes in New Zealand&#x27;s MMP electoral system. Unregistered parties can only nominate candidates for individual electorates.

, registered political parties are also able to spend up to $1,169,000 during the campaign for the party vote and $27,500 per electorate seat. Unregistered entities are able to spend up to $330,000 on general election advertising.

==Current parties==
===Parties represented in Parliament===
There are six parliamentary parties in the 54th New Zealand Parliament. The default order of this list corresponds to the number of MPs they currently have.

===Registered parties outside Parliament===
Parties listed in alphabetical order:

===Unregistered parties===
An accurate list of active unregistered parties can be difficult to determine. Any person may announce a political party, but these parties may or may not gain followers, receive any media coverage or go on to contest an election. It can also be difficult to determine when parties have ceased operating or moved away from politics.

The list below lists active and notable parties.
When a candidate stands for parliament in an electorate, they may describe themselves as &#x27;independent&#x27; or give a party name. A candidate listing a party name is not necessarily an indication that the party exists beyond that single candidate. In the 2023 general election, single candidates stood under the party names of Economic Euthenics, Future Youth, the Human Rights Party, the New World Order McCann Party, the New Zealand Sovereignty Party, the Northland Party, and the Republic of New Zealand Party. Two candidates stood under each of Not A Party (NAP), Protect &amp; Prosper New Zealand Party, and Workers Now.

Because New Zealand does not require political parties to be registered, any person can announce a political party, though may not receive media coverage or go on to contest an election. It can also be difficult to determine when such parties have ceased operating or moved away from politics. The list below is limited to notable parties understood to no longer be operating.

<doc id="340042" wikidata="Q2526679" url="?curid=340042" title="John Webb (architect)">
<text>John Webb (1611 – 24 October 1672) was an English architect and scholar, who collaborated on some works with Inigo Jones.

==Life==
He was born in Little Britain, Smithfield, London, and died in Butleigh in Somerset. He had a close association with fellow architect and theatre designer Inigo Jones, for whom he worked as an assistant from 1628. In the 1640s and 1650s, Jones and Webb jointly designed Wilton House (near Salisbury, Wiltshire) with its distinctive Single and Double Cube rooms.

Webb&#x27;s earliest known drawings were made for the Barber Surgeons&#x27; Hall in London in 1636–7, and in 1638 he designed a lodge for John Penruddock at Hale in Hampshire and stables for a Mr Featherstone, but it is unclear if these were built.

At the beginning of the Civil War, Jones left London to attend the King at Oxford. He was later in Basing House and was captured at the end of the siege. Webb stayed in London, having been appointed Deputy Surveyor by Jones. He acted as a spy for Charles I, probably out of zeal rather than by appointment, and sent the plans of London&#x27;s Lines of Communication (new fortifications) together with the number and location of the newly mounted guns.

In 1649 Webb made a number of drawings for Durham House, an unrealised project for a townhouse for the Earl of Pembroke on the Strand. In one drawing the emphasised keystones of the entrance and ground floor windows recall an early design by Jones for the Queen&#x27;s House.

Upon Jones&#x27; death in 1652, Webb inherited a substantial fortune as well as a library of drawings and designs, many of which dated back to Jones&#x27; influential travels to Italy.

In 1654 Webb designed the first classical portico on an English country house, at The Vyne in Hampshire. In the Corinthian style, this portico stamps this older house as Palladian, 50 years before the birth of Lord Burlington.

In the early 1660s Charles II commissioned Webb to rebuild Greenwich Palace in a more contemporary Baroque style. His plan was for three ranges around a courtyard, open on the north side towards the Thames. The buildings were to be aligned with Inigo Jones&#x27; Queen&#x27;s House, which stands a little way further south from the river, just short of the current northern boundary of Greenwich Park. The old buildings were demolished, but only one block of Webb&#x27;s design was built; constructed between 1664 and 1669, it was never occupied by the royal family, and was later incorporated into Christopher Wren&#x27;s designs for Greenwich Hospital, where it forms the eastern part of the King Charles Block. Webb also designed the enlargement of the Queen&#x27;s House in 1662.

Further afield they also share a connection with Kingston Lacy, a stately home in Dorset where Webb supervised early works (c. 1660) on the building, following designs originally prepared by Jones.

Webb also designed the rebuild of Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire between 1654 and 1668, and made alterations to Northumberland House, a large London townhouse. He also designed Gunnersbury House in Ealing. His buildings and architectural drawings differ from those of Inigo Jones particularly in the use of rustication, a contrast in texture which is less frequently seen in Jones&#x27; work.

==Legacy==
Webb&#x27;s surviving drawings, more than 200 in number, are held by Worcester College, Oxford, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and Chatsworth House. Webb may have been working towards a publication on the classical orders. An unbuilt design for a theatre attributed to Webb, discovered in the library of Worcester College, Oxford, was used as the basis for the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London, opened in 2014.

==Scholarship==
Webb collaborated with Inigo Jones and Walter Charleton to produce a book about Stonehenge. Ten years later, he published his own &quot;Vindication of Stone-heng Restored&quot; (1665).

===Sinology===
Following the restoration, there was growing interest in China and its culture. Several books were published in the 1660s in England. In 1669, Webb brought out &quot;An Historical Essay Endeavoring a Probability that the Language of the Empire of China is the Primitive Language&quot;, the first treatise on the Chinese language in any European language. Having never visited China or mastered the language, he based his essay on the travelogues of Jesuit missionaries.
