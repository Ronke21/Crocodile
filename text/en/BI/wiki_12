<text>Barefoot skiing is water skiing behind a motorboat without the use of water skis, commonly referred to as &quot;barefooting&quot;. Barefooting requires the skier to travel at higher speeds () than conventional water skiing (). The necessary speed required to keep the skier upright varies by the weight of the barefooter and can be approximated by the following formula: (W / 10) + 20, where W is the skier&#x27;s weight in pounds and the result is in miles per hour. It is an act performed in show skiing, and on its own.

==History of barefooting==
Barefoot water skiing originated in Winter Haven, Florida. According to the Water Ski Hall of Fame, and witnesses of the event, 17-year-old A.G. Hancock became the first person to barefoot water ski in 1947. That same year, Richard Downing &quot;Dick&quot; Pope Jr., was the first person to be photographed barefooting, stepping off his skis on a training boom alongside the boat. In 1950, the first barefoot competition was held in Cypress Gardens, with Pope and Mexican competitor Emilio Zamudio as the only two known barefooters in the world at the time. The first woman to waterski barefoot was Charlene Zint in 1951.

Throughout the 1950s, additional barefoot starting techniques were invented including the two-ski jump out, the beach start (invented by Ken Tibado in 1955), and the deep water start (invented by Joe Cash in 1958). The tumble-turn maneuver was &#x27;invented&#x27; by accident during a double barefoot routine in 1960 when Terry Vance fell onto his back during a step-off and partner Don Thomson (still on his skis) spun him around forward, enabling Vance to regain a standing posture. In 1961, Randy Rabe became the first backward barefooter by stepping off a trick ski backwards, a maneuver Dick Pope had first tried in 1950 but vowed never to try again after a painful fall. The early 1960s saw Don Thomson appear as the first &quot;superstar&quot; of the sport, developing both back-to-front and front-to-back turnarounds, and performing the first barefoot tandem ride in a show at Cypress Gardens.

During this time barefooting began developing in Australia as well. In April 1963, the first national competition was held in Australia, with 38 competitors. The Australians were the first to develop barefoot jumping, one of the three events in modern barefoot competition, as well as pioneer many new tricks. In November 1978, the first world championships were held in Canberra, Australia, where 54 skiers competed for a total of 10 different countries. Australians Brett Wing and Colleen Wilkinson captured the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s titles.
In 1976 Briton Keith Donnelly set the first (officially recognized) World Barefoot Jump record of 13.25 meters.

==Equipment==
Equipment required for barefooting:
* Boat – Barefooting requires a boat or other towing object that can travel to a speed of 30-45 mph with a barefooter under tow. Some boats are made specifically for barefooting, as they have small wakes and can travel at fast speeds. ABC Boats maintains a current list of boats approved by the American Barefoot Club.
* Handles and ropes – Normally a handled rope is used but may be optionally replaced with a ski boom (see below). A safety release may be used with the rope so that it can be detached from the boat in the event the barefooter becomes tangled in the rope. Though it is possible to barefoot with a normal 75.00-foot nylon tow rope and handle, many skiers use special ropes made out of Poly-E or Spectra to reduce spring. Barefoot handles have plastic tubing around them, so the skier can wrap their feet around the rope without getting rope burn and can have small modifications for frontward and backward toe holds.
* Personal Flotation Device – It is recommended and in many locations required that skiers and barefooters wear a flotation device or padded wetsuit.
* Helmet - In many locations, it is only required for jump.

Optional equipment:
* Barefoot wetsuit – The skier wears a fitted, padded neoprene barefoot wetsuit which has built-in flotation so that the need of a life jacket is unnecessary. It is possible to ski with a Coast Guard approved Type III flotation vest though this does not pad the skier well and the skier will not be able to perform many tricks.
* Padded shorts – Though not necessary, many barefooters wear padded neoprene shorts. These help pad the skier&#x27;s buttocks which is very helpful in performing the deep water start and tumble turns.
* Booms – Barefoot booms are used for learning barefooting and also, learning new barefoot tricks. The boom is a long pole that hangs over the edge of the boat and allows the barefooter to ski directly alongside the boat. Because the pole is fixed the barefooter may lean his or her body weight onto the pole and recover from falls more easily than on a rope.
* Shoe Skis – Shoe skis may be used for training. Shoe skis are small &#x27;skis&#x27; put on the foot that are only a few inches longer and wider than the skier&#x27;s foot. Shoe skiing is performed at a much lower speed (approx 18.00 mph) than barefooting because of the increased lift provided by the surface area of the ski. As an intermediate step to barefooting, flat soled street shoes may also be worn. This provides more lift than bare feet, but a more similar experience to barefooting than actual wooden &#x27;shoe skis&#x27;.

==Competition==
Barefoot water skiing has a competitive aspect which is very established. In traditional competition, there are three events:
* Tricks – The skier has two passes of 15 seconds to complete as many different tricks as possible. All tricks have specific point values depending on difficulty. The skier also is awarded points for the start trick they performed to get up. Mikey Caruso is the youngest barefoot water skier to ever compete longline in a tournament at the age of three at the 1988 Banana George Blairfoot Bananza, where he borrowed Parks Bonifay&#x27;s wetsuit.

The current world record for Men&#x27;s Open division is 13,350 points set by David Small on August 14, 2018,

For the Women&#x27;s Open division the world record is 10,100 pts. set by Ashleigh Stebbeings on March 13, 2014.

In the Boy&#x27;s division Jackson Gerard set a record of 12.850 points on July 28, 2018. It also counted as the Men&#x27;s Open record until broken two weeks later by World Barefoot Center teammate David Small.

For the Girls division a record of 7400 points was set by Georgia Groen on April 1, 2013.
* Slalom – The skier has two passes of 15 seconds to cross the wake as many times as possible. The skier can cross the wake forwards or backwards and on two feet or one foot.

The world record for Men&#x27;s Open division was set by Keith St. Onge on January 6, 2006 (20.6).

Ashleigh Stebbeings set the Women&#x27;s Open division world record on October 8, 2014, with a score of 17.2 points.

The Boys division world record of 19.2 pts. was set on January 6, 2006, by Heinrich Sam. It was tied by Jackson Gerard on August 16, 2018.

Nadine De Villiers set the Girl&#x27;s division world record of 16.1 pts. on April 5, 1997.
* Jump – The skier travels over a small, fiberglass jump ramp. They have three jumps and the longest one successfully landed counts. Professionals can jump as far as .

The current world record for Men&#x27;s Open division of was set by David Small on August 11, 2010.

With a jump of Ashleigh Stebbeings set the Women&#x27;s Open world record on February 19, 2017.

Tee-Jay Russo jumped to set the Boy&#x27;s division world record on December 29, 2018,

The Girl&#x27;s division world record of was set by Kim Rowswell on August 13, 2010.

Some other barefoot competitions feature endurance events. These include:
* Figure 8 – Two skiers on opposite sides of the wake ski while the boat drives in the pattern of a figure 8. The skier who is the last one standing wins.
* Team Endurance – This is a race between a variety of teams. Each team has a boat and the skiers take turns skiing. This generally takes place on a long river, where race distances can be up to about 45 miles. The first team to cross the finish line wins.

The newest form of Barefoot competition is an event which brings together all three events Tricks, Slalom and Jump into a single set.

<text>The Laplace number (), also known as the Suratman number (), is a dimensionless number used in the characterization of free surface fluid dynamics. It represents a ratio of surface tension to the momentum-transport (especially dissipation) inside a fluid. It is named after Pierre-Simon Laplace and Indonesian physicist P. C. Suratman.

It is defined as follows:

:formula_1

where:
* σ = surface tension
* ρ = density
* L = length
* μ = liquid viscosity

Laplace number is related to Reynolds number (Re) and Weber number (We) in the following way:

<text>The Analyst (subtitled A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician: Wherein It Is Examined Whether the Object, Principles, and Inferences of the Modern Analysis Are More Distinctly Conceived, or More Evidently Deduced, Than Religious Mysteries and Points of Faith) is a book by George Berkeley. It was first published in 1734, first by J. Tonson (London), then by S. Fuller (Dublin). The &quot;infidel mathematician&quot; is believed to have been Edmond Halley, though others have speculated Sir Isaac Newton was intended.

The book contains a direct attack on the foundations of calculus, specifically on Isaac Newton&#x27;s notion of fluxions and on Leibniz&#x27;s notion of infinitesimal change.

==Background and purpose ==

From his earliest days as a writer, Berkeley had taken up his satirical pen to attack what were then called &#x27;free-thinkers&#x27; (secularists, sceptics, agnostics, atheists, etc.—in short, anyone who doubted the truths of received Christian religion or called for a diminution of religion in public life). In 1732, in the latest installment in this effort, Berkeley published his &quot;Alciphron&quot;, a series of dialogues directed at different types of &#x27;free-thinkers&#x27;. One of the archetypes Berkeley addressed was the secular scientist, who discarded Christian mysteries as unnecessary superstitions, and declared his confidence in the certainty of human reason and science. Against his arguments, Berkeley mounted a subtle defense of the validity and usefulness of these elements of the Christian faith.

&quot;Alciphron&quot; was widely read and caused a bit of a stir. But it was an offhand comment mocking Berkeley&#x27;s arguments by the &#x27;free-thinking&#x27; royal astronomer Sir Edmund Halley that prompted Berkeley to pick up his pen again and try a new tack. The result was &quot;The Analyst&quot;, conceived as a satire attacking the foundations of mathematics with the same vigour and style as &#x27;free-thinkers&#x27; routinely attacked religious truths.

Berkeley sought to take apart the then foundations of calculus, claimed to uncover numerous gaps in proof, attacked the use of infinitesimals, the diagonal of the unit square, the very existence of numbers, etc. The general point was not so much to mock mathematics or mathematicians, but rather to show that mathematicians, like Christians, relied upon incomprehensible &#x27;mysteries&#x27; in the foundations of their reasoning. Moreover, the existence of these &#x27;superstitions&#x27; was not fatal to mathematical reasoning, indeed it was an aid. So too with the Christian faithful and their &#x27;mysteries&#x27;. Berkeley concluded that the certainty of mathematics is no greater than the certainty of religion.

== Content ==

&quot;The Analyst&quot; was a direct attack on the foundations of calculus, specifically on Newton&#x27;s notion of fluxions and on Leibniz&#x27;s notion of infinitesimal change. In section 16, Berkeley criticises
...the fallacious way of proceeding to a certain Point on the Supposition of an Increment, and then at once shifting your Supposition to that of no Increment . . . Since if this second Supposition had been made before the common Division by &quot;o&quot;, all had vanished at once, and you must have got nothing by your Supposition. Whereas by this Artifice of first dividing, and then changing your Supposition, you retain 1 and nxn-1. But, notwithstanding all this address to cover it, the fallacy is still the same.

It is a frequently quoted passage, particularly when he wrote:
And what are these Fluxions? The Velocities of evanescent Increments? And what are these same evanescent Increments? They are neither finite Quantities nor Quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?

Berkeley did not dispute the results of calculus; he acknowledged the results were true. The thrust of his criticism was that Calculus was not more logically rigorous than religion. He instead questioned whether mathematicians &quot;submit to Authority, take things upon Trust&quot; just as followers of religious tenets did. According to Burton, Berkeley introduced an ingenious theory of compensating errors that were meant to explain the correctness of the results of calculus. Berkeley contended that the practitioners of calculus introduced several errors which cancelled, leaving the correct answer. In his own words, &quot;by virtue of a twofold mistake you arrive, though not at science, yet truth.&quot;

== Analysis ==
The idea that Newton was the intended recipient of the discourse is put into doubt by a passage that appears toward the end of the book: 
&quot; &quot;Query 58: Whether it be really an effect of Thinking, that the same Men admire the great author for his Fluxions, and deride him for his Religion?&quot; &quot;

Here Berkeley ridicules those who celebrate Newton (the inventor of &quot;fluxions&quot;, roughly equivalent to the differentials of later versions of the differential calculus) as a genius while deriding his well-known religiosity. Since Berkeley is here explicitly calling attention to Newton&#x27;s religious faith, that seems to indicate he did not mean his readers to identify the &quot;infidel (i.e., lacking faith) mathematician&quot; with Newton.

Mathematics historian Judith Grabiner comments, &quot;Berkeley&#x27;s criticisms of the rigor of the calculus were witty, unkind, and — with respect to the mathematical practices he was criticizing — essentially correct&quot;. While his critiques of the mathematical practices were sound, his essay has been criticised on logical and philosophical grounds.

For example, David Sherry argues that Berkeley&#x27;s criticism of infinitesimal calculus consists of a logical criticism and a metaphysical criticism. The logical criticism is that of a &quot;fallacia suppositionis&quot;, which means gaining points in an argument by means of one assumption and, while keeping those points, concluding the argument with a contradictory assumption. The metaphysical criticism is a challenge to the existence itself of concepts such as fluxions, moments, and infinitesimals, and is rooted in Berkeley&#x27;s empiricist philosophy which tolerates no expression without a referent. Andersen (2011) showed that Berkeley&#x27;s doctrine of the compensation of errors contains a logical circularity. Namely, Berkeley&#x27;s determination of the derivative of the quadratic function relies on Apollonius&#x27;s determination of the tangent of the parabola.

== Influence ==
Two years after this publication, Thomas Bayes published anonymously &quot;An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of the Analyst&quot; (1736), in which he defended the logical foundation of Isaac Newton&#x27;s calculus against the criticism outlined in &quot;The Analyst&quot;. Colin Maclaurin&#x27;s two-volume &quot;Treatise of Fluxions&quot; published in 1742 also began as a response to Berkeley attacks, intended to show that Newton&#x27;s calculus was rigorous by reducing it to the methods of Greek geometry.

Despite these attempts, calculus continued to be developed using non-rigorous methods until around 1830 when Augustin Cauchy, and later Bernhard Riemann and Karl Weierstrass, redefined the derivative and integral using a rigorous definition of the concept of limit. The idea of using limits as a foundation for calculus had been suggested by d&#x27;Alembert, but d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s definition was not rigorous by modern standards. The concept of limits had already appeared in the work of Newton, but was not stated with sufficient clarity to hold up to the criticism of Berkeley.

In 1966, Abraham Robinson introduced &quot;Non-standard Analysis&quot;, which provided a rigorous foundation for working with infinitely small quantities. This provided another way of putting calculus on a mathematically rigorous foundation, the way it was done before the (ε, δ)-definition of limit had been fully developed.

=== Ghosts of departed quantities ===
Towards the end of &quot;The Analyst,&quot; Berkeley addresses possible justifications for the foundations of calculus that mathematicians may put forward. In response to the idea fluxions could be defined using ultimate ratios of vanishing quantities, Berkeley wrote:

It must, indeed, be acknowledged, that [Newton] used Fluxions, like the Scaffold of a building, as things to be laid aside or got rid of, as soon as finite Lines were found proportional to them. But then these finite Exponents are found by the help of Fluxions. Whatever therefore is got by such Exponents and Proportions is to be ascribed to Fluxions: which must therefore be previously understood. And what are these Fluxions? The Velocities of evanescent Increments? And what are these same evanescent Increments? They are neither finite Quantities nor Quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the Ghosts of departed Quantities?

Edwards describes this as the most memorable point of the book. Katz and Sherry argue that the expression was intended to address both infinitesimals and Newton&#x27;s theory of fluxions.

Today the phrase &quot;ghosts of departed quantities&quot; is also used when discussing Berkeley&#x27;s attacks on other possible foundations of Calculus. In particular it is used when discussing infinitesimals, but it is also used when discussing differentials, and adequality.

== Text and commentary ==

&quot;The Analyst&quot; is also reproduced, with commentary, in recent works:

Ewald concludes that Berkeley&#x27;s objections to the calculus of his day were mostly well taken at the time.

<text>Straw-bale construction is a building method that uses bales of straw (usually wheat straw) as structural elements, building insulation, or both. This construction method is commonly used in natural building or &quot;brown&quot; construction projects. Research has shown that straw-bale construction is a sustainable method for building, from the standpoint of both materials and energy needed for heating and cooling.

Advantages of straw-bale construction over conventional building systems include the renewable nature of straw, cost, easy availability, naturally fire-retardant and high insulation value. Disadvantages include susceptibility to rot, difficulty of obtaining insurance coverage, and high space requirements for the straw itself. Research has been done using moisture probes placed within the straw wall in which 7 of 8 locations had moisture contents of less than 20%. This is a moisture level that does not aid in the breakdown of the straw. However, proper construction of the straw-bale wall is important in keeping moisture levels down, just as in the construction of any type of building.

==History==
Straw houses have been built on the African plains since the Paleolithic Era. Straw bales were used in construction 400 years ago in Germany; and straw-thatched roofs have long been used in northern Europe and Asia. When European Settlers came to North America, teepees were insulated in winter with loose straw between the inner lining and outer cover.

Straw-bale construction was greatly facilitated by the mechanical hay baler, which was invented in the 1850s and was widespread by the 1890s. It proved particularly useful in the Nebraska Sandhills. Pioneers seeking land under the 1862 Homestead Act and the 1904 Kinkaid Act found a dearth of trees over much of Nebraska. In many parts of the state, the soil was suitable for dugouts and sod houses.
However, in the Sandhills, the soil generally made poor construction sod; 
in the few places where suitable sod could be found, it was more valuable for agriculture than as a building material.

The first documented use of hay bales in construction in Nebraska was a schoolhouse built in 1896 or 1897. Unfenced and unprotected by stucco or plaster, it was reported in 1902 as having been eaten by cows. To combat this, builders began plastering their bale structures; if cement or lime stucco was unavailable, locally obtained &quot;gumbo mud&quot; was employed. Between 1896 and 1945, an estimated 70 straw-bale buildings, including houses, farm buildings, churches, schools, offices, and grocery stores had been built in the Sandhills. In 1990, nine surviving bale buildings were reported in Arthur and Logan Counties,
including the 1928 Pilgrim Holiness Church in the village of Arthur, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Since the 1990s straw-bale construction has been substantially revived, particularly in North America, Europe, and Australia. Straw was one of the first materials to be used in green buildings. This revival is likely attributed to greater environmental awareness and the material&#x27;s natural, non-toxic qualities, low embodied energy, and relative affordability. Straw-bale construction has encountered issues regarding building codes depending on the location of the building. However, in the USA, the introduction of Appendices S and R in the 2015 International Residential Code has helped to legitimize and improve understanding of straw-bale construction. In France, the approval in 2012 of professional rules for straw-building recognized it as “common technology” and qualifies for standard-insurance programs.

==Method==

Straw bale building typically consists of stacking rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or foundation, with a moisture barrier or capillary break between the bales and their supporting platform. There are two types of straw-bales commonly used, those bound together with two strings and those with three. The three string bale is the larger in all three dimensions. Bale walls can be tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then stuccoed or plastered, either with a lime-based formulation or earth/clay render. The bales may actually provide the structural support for the building (&quot;load-bearing&quot; or &quot;Nebraska-style&quot; technique), as was the case in the original examples from the late 19th century. The plastered bale assembly also can be designed to provide lateral and shear support for wind and seismic loads.
Alternatively, bale buildings can have a structural frame of other materials, usually lumber or timber-frame, with bales simply serving as insulation and plaster substrate, (&quot;infill&quot; or &quot;non-loadbearing&quot; technique), which is most often required in northern regions and/or in wet climates. In northern regions, the potential snow-loading can exceed the strength of the bale walls. In wet climates, the imperative for applying a vapor-permeable finish precludes the use of cement-based stucco. Additionally, the inclusion of a skeletal framework of wood or metal allows the erection of a roof prior to raising the bales, which can protect the bale wall during construction, when it is the most vulnerable to water damage in all but the most dependably arid climates. A combination of framing and load-bearing techniques may also be employed, referred to as &quot;hybrid&quot; straw bale construction.
Straw bales can also be used as part of a Spar and Membrane Structure (SMS) wall system in which lightly reinforced sprayed concrete skins are interconnected with extended X-shaped light rebar in the head joints of the bales. In this wall system the concrete skins provide structure, seismic reinforcing, and fireproofing, while the bales are used as leave-in formwork and insulation.

The University of Bath has completed a research programme which used ‘ModCell’ panels—prefabricated panels consisting of a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales and rendered with a breathable lime-based system—to build &#x27;BaleHaus&#x27;, a straw bale construction on the university&#x27;s campus. Monitoring work of the structure carried out by architectural researchers at the university has found that as well as reducing the environmental footprint, the construction offers other benefits, including healthier living through higher levels of thermal insulation and regulation of humidity levels. The group has published a number of research papers on its findings.

High density pre-compressed bales (&quot;straw blocks&quot;) can bear higher loads than traditional &quot;field bales&quot; (bales created with baling machines on farms). While field bales support around of wall length, high-density bales can bear at least .

Bale buildings can also be constructed of non-straw bales—such as those made from recycled material such as tires, cardboard, paper, plastic, and carpeting—and even bags containing &quot;bales&quot; of wood chips or rice hulls.

Straw bales have also been used in very energy efficient high-performance buildings such as the S-House in Austria which meets the Passivhaus energy standard. In South Africa, a five-star lodge made from 10,000 strawbales has housed world leaders Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair. In the Swiss Alps, in the little village of Nax Mont-Noble, construction works have begun in October 2011 for the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales. The Harrison Vault, in Joshua Tree, California, is engineered to withstand the high seismic loads in that area using only the assembly consisting of bales, lath and plaster. The technique was used successfully for strawbale housing in rural China. Straw bale domes along the Syrio-African rift at Kibbutz Lotan have an interior geodesic frame of steel pipes. 
Another method to reap the benefits of straw is to incorporate straw-bale walls into a pre-existing structure.

Straw bales are widely used to insulate walls, but they may also be used to insulate roofs and sub-floors.

==Thermal properties==

Compressed straw bales have a wide range of documented R-value. R-value is a measurement of a materials insulating quality, higher the number the more insulating. The reported R-value ranges from 17–55 (in American units) or 3–9.6 (in SI) depending on the study, differing wall designs could be responsible for wide range in R-value. given that the bales are over a foot thick, the R-value per inch is lower than most other commercial insulation types including batts (3–4) and foamboard (~5). Bale walls are typically coated with a thick layer of plaster, which provides a well-distributed thermal mass, active on a short-term (diurnal) cycle. The combination of insulation and mass provide an excellent platform for passive solar building design for winter and summer.

In common with most building materials, there is a degree of uncertainty in the thermal conductivity due to the influences of temperature, moisture content and density. However, from evaluation of a range of literature and experimental data, a value of 0.064 W/m·K is regarded as a representative design value for straw bales at the densities typically used in building construction.

Compressed and plastered straw bale walls are also resistant to fire.

The hygrothermal properties of straw bales have been measured and reviewed in several technical papers. According to research, the thermal conductivity does not differ significantly depending on the type of straw. Samples with densities between 63 and 350 kg/m3 have been analysed. The best performing was characterised by a thermal conductivity of 0.038 W m−1 K−1. Marques et al., Reif et al. and Cascone et al. indicate that the thermal conductivity of straw is relatively insensitive to bale density. The thermal conductivity of straw bales has been shown to differ with the direction of the straw&#x27;s orientation within the bale, with straws with fibres oriented perpendicularly or randomly to the heat flow having lower thermal conductivity than those arranged in parallel. For different temperatures and densities, Vjelien studied four variations of the same kind of straw: two variations concerned the direction of the fibres in relation to the heat flow: perpendicular and parallel, and the other two concerned the macrostructure chopped straw and defibrated straw. The thermal conductivity of the defibrated straw was lower than that of the chopped straw.

=== Efficiency ===
The use of straw bales as thermal insulation in buildings has been studied by many authors. They mainly focus on the straw’s thermal and hygrothermal properties. The findings showed that using straw in construction improves energy, environmental, and economic efficiency:

Some studies have evaluated the advantages of using straw bales for building insulation. Measurements carried out in an innovative and sustainable house built in France have shown that this material helps to minimize heating degrees and energy consumption. The simulated heating requirements in the winter are calculated to be 59 kW h/m2. In Italy, the energy-saving potential of a straw wall was assessed under various climatic conditions. As compared to the Italian regulations’ reference of a Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB), the straw wall performed extremely well in terms of energy efficiency. The embodied energy of a straw wall structure is about half that of a conventional wall assembly, and the corresponding CO2 emissions are more than 40% lower. Furthermore, in the summer, straw bale walls provide significant thermal inertia.

Liuzzi et al. compared expanded polystyrene (EPS), straw fibre, and olive fibre in a hygrothermal simulation of a flat in two different climatic zones (Bari and Bilbao), assuming a retrofit via interior panels. The simulation results show that the annual energy requirement when using straw fibre and olive fibre panels is close to the annual energy requirement for expanded polystyrene panels in both climates. During the cooling season, however, olive fibre and straw fibre insulation panels perform better, with a reduction of approximately 21% in Bilbao and 14% in Bari.

Straw has a thermal conductivity similar to that of common insulating materials. It has a thermal conductivity of 0.038–0.08 W m−1 K−1, which is comparable to other wood fibre insulation materials. To achieve the same thermal insulation efficiency as other more insulating materials such as extruded and extended polystyrene, the thickness of the straw insulation layer should be increased by 30–90%.

==Problems with straw-bale==
Two significant problems related to straw-bale construction are moisture and mold. During the construction phase, buildings need to be protected from rain and from water leakages into the body of the walls. If exposed to water, compressed straw may expand due to absorption of moisture. In turn, this can cause more cracking through which more moisture can infiltrate. Further damage to the wall can be caused by mold releasing potentially toxic spores into the wall cavities and into the air. In hot climates, where walls may have become internally dampened, internal temperatures may rise (due to decomposition of affected straw). Rats and mice can infiltrate straw bale homes during construction, so care must be taken to keep such animals out of the material. Other problems relate to straw dust which may cause breathing difficulties among people with allergies to straw or hay.

Several companies have developed prefabricated straw bale walls. A passive ecological house can easily be assembled with those panels.

<text>Jack Carroll &quot;Jay&quot; Haldeman II (December 18, 1941 – January 1, 2002) was an American biologist and science-fiction writer. He was the older brother of SF writer and MIT writing professor Joe Haldeman.

== Biography ==
Jack Haldeman studied environmental engineering and biology at the University of Oklahoma, and received a degree from Johns Hopkins University. His scientific career included work in parasitology, field studies of whales in the Canadian Arctic, study of the greenhouse effect, and coordination of a website and a CD-ROM relating to agriculture in Florida. The tapeworm &quot;Hymenolepis haldemani&quot; was named after him.

Haldeman published at least 75 short stories, beginning with &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; in the magazine &quot;Fantastic&quot; (December 1971). He is notable for writing science fiction with sports themes; &quot;Home Team Advantage&quot;, first appearing in &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; in 1977, has been anthologized a number of times. &quot;High Steel&quot;, a 1982 story co-authored with Jack Dann, was a Nebula Award nominee; it was later expanded into a novel.

Haldeman became a member of the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1971, and went on to chair eight SF conventions. He was married to writer Barbara Delaplace; they collaborated on stories beginning with &quot;That&#x27;ll be the Day&quot; in the anthology &quot;Alternate Tyrants&quot;.

Haldeman died of cancer in 2002, at the Hospice of North Central Florida in his hometown of Gainesville, Florida.

<text>Revenge of the Nerds is a 1984 American comedy film directed by Jeff Kanew and starring Robert Carradine, Anthony Edwards, Ted McGinley, and Bernie Casey. Its plot chronicles a group of nerds at the fictional Adams College trying to stop the ongoing harassment by jock fraternity Alpha Betas and its sister sorority, Pi Delta Pi.

==Plot==

Best friends and nerds Lewis Skolnick and Gilbert Lowe enroll in Adams College to study computer science. The Alpha Betas, a fraternity that includes most of the Adams football team, carelessly burn down their own house and urged by Coach Harris, take over the freshman dorms, throwing the freshmen out into the street. Dean Ulich designates temporary living space in the gymnasium and allows the freshmen to rush the fraternities. Lewis, Gilbert, and several other nerds fail to join fraternities but obtain and renovate a dilapidated house near campus.

The Alpha Betas, led by star quarterback Stan Gable, are irked by the nerds&#x27; success, and Stan sets his fellow members to harassing the nerds, which includes throwing a rock through the window that says &quot;Nerds, get out&quot;. The nerds complain to campus police who are constrained by the Greek Council that adjudicates all such pranks. Stan is currently president of the Council and largely controls its processes. The nerds decide to seek membership in the Greek Council by joining a national fraternity. After 29 rejection letters, the only one to consider them is the black fraternity Lambda Lambda Lambda (Tri-Lambs), led by U.N. Jefferson. After meeting the nerds, Jefferson is about to refuse their application when Poindexter notices the Tri-Lambs rulebook states that all applicants are given probationary membership. The nerds organize a large party with the Omega Mu sorority, similarly made up of nerdy and overweight women, including Gilbert&#x27;s girlfriend Judy, and invite Jefferson to attend. The party is dull until Booger provides everyone with high quality marijuana. The Alpha Betas and the Pi Delta Pis, the sorority to which Stan&#x27;s girlfriend Betty Childs belongs, then disrupt the party by bringing and releasing pigs. The nerds exact revenge on both groups by pulling pranks of their own. Impressed with the nerds&#x27; tenacity, Jefferson grants them full membership.

However, the harassment intensifies, and Stan prevents any attempts by the Greek Council to sanction Alpha Beta. The nerds realize the only way to get the Council to help is to put one of their own in as president, which they can do by winning the Greek Games during homecoming. Partnering with the Omega Mus and using their extensive scientific knowledge and creativity, the Tri-Lambs compete strongly with the Alpha Betas and Pi Delta Pis during the athletic events. At the charity fundraiser, the nerds heavily outsell the Alpha Betas by offering pies containing hidden nude pictures of Betty and other Pi Delta Pis. During this, Lewis, who has fallen in love with Betty, steals Stan&#x27;s costume and tricks Betty into engaging in sexual intercourse with him. Finally, the nerds dominate the musical competition with a techno-computer-driven musical production, winning the overall games. Lewis immediately nominates Gilbert as the new Council president.
Coach Harris lambasts the Alpha Betas for losing to the nerds, and Stan leads them in vandalizing the Tri-Lamb house. The nerds become despondent, and Gilbert decides to barge into the middle of the Homecoming Pep Rally to voice his complaints. The Alpha Betas try to stop him, but Jefferson and a large group of national Tri-Lambs arrive to intimidate the Alpha Betas, offering Gilbert the opportunity to give a rousing speech about standing up to discrimination. Lewis and the other Tri-Lambs, many alumni, and Betty, who announces she is &quot;in love with a nerd&quot;, join in cheering Gilbert, soundly shaming the Alpha Betas. An emboldened Dean Ulich instructs Coach Harris that the Tri-Lambs will now live in the Alpha Beta house, while the Alpha Betas will live in the gym until they can repair the Tri-Lamb house.

==Cast==
==Development==
The movie was inspired by a Los Angeles magazine article, titled &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;, that describes computer programmers gaining respect in Silicon Valley.

Director Jeff Kanew saw Ted McGinley on the cover of a &quot;Men of USC&quot; calendar and decided he was perfect for the role of the head of the Alpha Beta fraternity. Kanew cast Matt Salinger as another Alpha Beta brother because he loved his father J. D. Salinger&#x27;s book &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; so much.

A scene of a Tri-Lambda convention in Las Vegas was deleted because a 20th Century Fox executive thought it was making fun of him.

==Production==
The University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, was chosen to film many of the exterior scenes. Bill J. Varney, the university&#x27;s assistant vice president for administrative services, approved filming, particularly after 20th Century Fox agreed to make a large donation to the university. Two weeks later, the university&#x27;s administrators revoked permission to film on campus. Dudley B. Woodard, university vice president for student affairs, said the movie would not &quot;portray campus life in a representative way&quot;. Allan Beigel, vice president of university relations, said there was nothing that would make them change their minds.

After some negotiations, the university allowed filming on campus as long as the producers tried to schedule film shooting so as to not affect campus activities, not film anything &quot;with a questionable nature with regards to taste&quot;, and accept advice from fraternities. Film shooting on campus began in January 1984.

The nerds&#x27; original residence, from which they were ousted by the Alpha Betas, was actually Cochise Hall. Their subsequent residence was University of Arizona&#x27;s Bear Down Gymnasium. The original Alpha Beta fraternity house that is burned down was filmed at the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity house (on University Boulevard).

Casting for extras, specifically for mean jocks, sorority sisters, and members of a black fraternity, was held at the University of Arizona&#x27;s Drama Building and at a Tucson Hilton Inn.

While working as a security guard during filming, an off-duty police officer found a vial with a small amount of cocaine in a dressing room. The police decided not to pursue an investigation because it would be impossible to determine whose it was.

Interior scenes were shot at Old Tucson Studios.

Different sources report the film&#x27;s budget between $6million and $8million, low for a feature film of the time.

According to producers Ted Field and Peter Samuelson, the two had to fight for the ending pep rally scene as others involved in the production wanted a more cathartic ending where the Nerds would get more violent revenge on the Alpha Betas including destroying their house. Field and Samuelson further stated that the nerds&#x27; actions were inspired by Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s usage of passive resistance.

==Soundtrack==


Ollie E. Brown, of Ollie &amp; Jerry fame, wrote and performed the song &quot;They&#x27;re So Incredible&quot; for the film, under the name Revenge. In the film, the song is performed by the Tri-Lambs at the final event of the Greek Games and contains different lyrics.

Three songs appear in the film but not on the soundtrack: &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; by Talking Heads, &quot;Thriller&quot; by Michael Jackson, and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; by Queen.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; was panned by many reviewers at release. Lawrence Van Gelder for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It is the absence of genuine comedy that exposes glaringly the film&#x27;s fundamental attitude of condescension and scorn toward blacks and women, and a tendency toward stereotyping that clashes violently with its superficial message of tolerance, compassion and fair play.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said &quot;&quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; is primarily the story of outcasts getting their just rewards, and that is always a satisfying movie ingredient. Nonetheless, this scattergun, often scatological film is filled with extensive racial stereotypes, which may offend some moviegoers.&quot; &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; said that Lewis&#x27;s pursuit of a cheerleader &quot;goes beyond being pathetic and becomes masochistic&quot;. &quot;Newsday&quot; called it &quot;another predictable and witless teenage sex comedy&quot;.

Kevin Thomas of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; thoroughly enjoyed the movie, calling it &quot;a delicious, gratifying underdog fantasy and a raunchy, uproarious satire set in the often cruel and inherently discriminating world of college fraternities and sororities&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; was released in theaters on July 20, 1984, although some theaters showed the movie a few days early as a sneak preview.

The film grossed $40million domestically.

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD on March 6, 2007, and on Blu-ray on May 6, 2014, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

==Legacy==
===Lasting reception===
The film holds a 71% critics&#x27; approval rating film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 43 critics&#x27; reviews. Their consensus reads: &quot;Undeniably lowbrow but surprisingly sly, &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; has enough big laughs to qualify as a minor classic in the slobs-vs.-snobs subgenre&quot;.

On Metacritic, it has a score of 44 out of 100, based on reviews from six critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

It is #91 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;.

===Fraternity===
Due to the influence of the film, a genuine Lambda Lambda Lambda fraternity was founded at the University of Connecticut in 2006, and several chapters have launched. The &quot;Tri-Lambs&quot; (not an all-black fraternity as portrayed in the film, but open to all races and orientations) has six chapters in Connecticut, Maryland, New York, and Washington state.

===Controversy===
About three decades after the film&#x27;s release, some commentators have looked at the film and considered some of the scenes, particularly when Lewis pretends to be Stan and has a sexual encounter with Betty, to be rape by deception and a misogynistic remnant of a male-dominated culture of that time. William Bradley of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; stated that after viewing the film again as an adult he &quot;was immediately struck by the way the film plays sexual exploitation and assault for laughs&quot;. Amy Benfer of &quot;Salon&quot; wrote that the &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; scene, and a similar scene in John Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, were evidence that at the time of these films&#x27; productions, &quot;people were stupid about date rape&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;GQ&quot; in 2019, director Jeff Kanew and writer Steve Zacharias expressed their regret regarding the rape by deception scene, with Kanew saying, &quot;In a way, it&#x27;s not excusable. If it were my daughter, I probably wouldn&#x27;t like it&quot;.

===Sequels===
Three less successful sequels followed; the last two are television films.
* &quot;Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise&quot; (1987)
* &quot;Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation&quot; (1992)
* &quot;Revenge of the Nerds IV: Nerds in Love&quot; (1994)

===Planned remake===
A remake of the original &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; was slated for release in 2007, the first project for the newly created Fox Atomic, but was canceled in November 2006 after two weeks of filming. The cast included Adam Brody, Dan Byrd, Katie Cassidy, Kristin Cavallari, Jenna Dewan, Chris Marquette, Ryan Pinkston, Efren Ramirez, and Nick Zano. The film was to be directed by Kyle Newman, executive produced by McG, and written by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah, Adam Jay Epstein and Andrew Jacobson, and Adam F. Goldberg.

Filming took place in Atlanta, Georgia at Agnes Scott College, the Georgia State Capitol, and Inman Park. Filming was originally scheduled to take place at Emory University, but university officials changed their minds after reading the script. The film was shelved after producers found the movie difficult to shoot on the smaller Agnes Scott campus and studio head Peter Rice was disappointed with the dailies. 20th Century Fox personnel have stated that it is highly unlikely that a remake will be picked up in the future.

Seth MacFarlane announced his intentions to reboot the series under his Fuzzy Door Productions for 20th Century Studios in December 2020 with Kenny and Keith Lucas to write and star in the film.

===Television===
A pilot for a &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; television series directed by Peter Baldwin was produced in 1991, but was never aired and was not picked up for a series. The aborted TV pilot was later included as a bonus in the DVD and Blu-ray release of the film.

In the mid-2000s, Armstrong and Carradine had devised an idea for a reality television show based on nerds competing against each other in challenges, inspired by &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;. However, the idea was rejected at the time, due to the competing &quot;Beauty and the Geek&quot; show. Six years later, Armstrong and Carradine shopped the idea around and were able to get the show greenlit on TBS in 2012. &quot;King of the Nerds&quot; ran for three seasons from 2013 to 2015, with Armstrong and Carradine hosting.

<doc id="341407" wikidata="Q115767" url="?curid=341407" title="Damköhler numbers">
<text>The Damköhler numbers (Da) are dimensionless numbers used in chemical engineering to relate the chemical reaction timescale (reaction rate) to the transport phenomena rate occurring in a system. It is named after German chemist Gerhard Damköhler, who worked in chemical engineering, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. 
The [[Karlovitz number]] (Ka) is related to the Damköhler number by Da = 1/Ka.

In its most commonly used form, the first Damköhler number (DaI) relates particles&#x27; characteristic residence time scale in a fluid region to the reaction timescale. The residence time scale can take the form of a convection time scale, such as volumetric flow rate through the reactor for continuous (plug flow or stirred tank) or semibatch chemical processes:
: formula_1
In reacting systems that include interphase mass transport, the first Damköhler number can be written as the ratio of the chemical reaction rate to the mass transfer rate
: formula_2

It is also defined as the ratio of the characteristic fluidic and chemical time scales:
: formula_3

Since the reaction rate determines the reaction timescale, the exact formula for the Damköhler number varies according to the rate law equation. For a general chemical reaction A → B following the Power law kinetics of n-th order, the Damköhler number for a convective flow system is defined as:

: formula_4
where:
* &quot;k&quot; = kinetics reaction rate constant
* &quot;C&quot;0 = initial concentration
* &quot;n&quot; = reaction order
* formula_5 = mean residence time or space-time

On the other hand, the second Damköhler number (DaII) is defined in general as:
: formula_6
It compares the process energy of a thermochemical reaction (such as the energy involved in a nonequilibrium gas process) with a related enthalpy difference (driving force).
In terms of reaction rates:
: formula_7
where
* &quot;kg&quot; is the global mass transport coefficient
* &quot;a&quot; is the interfacial area

The value of Da provides a quick estimate of the degree of conversion that can be achieved. If DaI goes to infinity, the residence time greatly exceeds the reaction time, such that nearly all chemical reactions have taken place during the period of residency, this is the transport limited case, where the reaction is much faster than the diffusion. Otherwise if DaI goes to 0, the residence time is much shorter than the reaction time, so that no chemical reaction has taken place during the brief period when the fluid particles occupy the reaction location, this is the reaction limited case, where diffusion happens much faster than the reaction. Similarly, DaII goes to 0 implies that the energy of the chemical reaction is negligible compared to the energy of the flow. The limit of the Damköhler number going to infinity is called the Burke–Schumann limit. 

As a rule of thumb, when Da is less than 0.1 a conversion of less than 10% is achieved, and when Da is greater than 10 a conversion of more than 90% is expected. 

==Derivation for decomposition of a single species==
From the general mole balance on some species formula_8, where for a CSTR steady state and perfect mixing are assumed,

: formula_9

: formula_10

: formula_11

Assuming a constant volumetric flow rate formula_12, which is the case for a liquid reactor or a gas phase reaction with no net generation of moles,

: formula_13

: formula_14

: formula_15

where the space-time is defined to be the ratio of the reactor volume to volumetric flow rate. It is the time required for a slug of fluid to pass through the reactor. For a decomposition reaction, the rate of reaction is proportional to some power of the concentration of formula_8. In addition, for a single reaction a conversion may be defined in terms of the limiting reactant, for the simple decomposition that is species formula_8

: formula_18

: formula_19

: formula_20

: formula_21

As can be seen, as the Damköhler number increases, the other term must decrease. The ensuing polynomial can be solved and the conversion for the rule of thumb Damköhler numbers found. Alternatively, one can graph the expressions and see where they intersect with the line given by the inverse Damköhler number to see the solution for conversion. In the plot below, the &quot;y&quot;-axis is the inverse Damköhler number and the &quot;x&quot;-axis the conversion. The rule-of-thumb inverse Damköhler numbers have been placed as dashed horizontal lines.

<doc id="341409" wikidata="Q3365196" url="?curid=341409" title="Socialist Appeal (UK, 1992)">
<text>Socialist Appeal was the British section of the International Marxist Tendency (IMT), founded in 1992 alongside the IMT by supporters of Ted Grant and Alan Woods after they were expelled from the Militant tendency of the Labour Party. In 2024 the Great Britain-based elements of the IMT were relaunched as the Revolutionary Communist Party.

The organisation described itself as a &quot;Marxist organisation which stands for the socialist transformation of society.&quot; Its stated aim was to build a revolutionary leadership capable of leading the working class in a struggle against capitalism. It described its politics as descending from Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky.

Socialist Appeal published a fortnightly newspaper under the same name until January 2024, and operated the Wellred Books publisher and bookstore.

== History ==
In the 1970s and 1980s, Socialist Appeal&#x27;s predecessor, the Militant tendency, had been a significant force within the British Labour Party. At the height of its influence in the mid-to-late 1980s, Militant had three Labour MPs, control of Liverpool City Council and later initiated the campaign that they claim forced the abandonment of the poll tax. Grant had been one of the founders and the theoretical leader of the Militant group, but he was expelled with other supporters after the 1991 debate on the Open Turn.

The split was caused by what Grant and Woods claimed was the bureaucratic centralist degeneration of Militant&#x27;s internal regime, as well as Grant&#x27;s continued support for the tactic of entryism within the Labour Party. In 1991, Militant decided by a large majority to abandon entryism in the Labour Party. Ted Grant, once the group&#x27;s most important member, was expelled and his breakaway minority, which adopted the name Socialist Appeal, continued with the entryist strategy. The majority changed its name to Militant Labour and then in 1997 to the Socialist Party. 

Socialist Appeal began publishing their own journal in 1992. In 2000, the group was estimated to have around 250 supporters.

In 2013, Socialist Appeal launched a student wing, the Marxist Student Federation (MSF), to provide a &quot;national platform for Marxist ideas in the student movement,&quot; focused on political discussions at university Marxist societies, as well as campaigning within the labour movement.

Following the Scottish independence referendum in which Scots voted to retain the union with the rest of the United Kingdom, the International Marxist Tendency launched a separate Scottish periodical called &quot;Revolution&quot;, which analysed events in Scotland, and put forward a Marxist position in relation to the Scottish independence movement. &quot;Revolution&quot;&#x27;s masthead carries the slogan &quot;For a Scottish workers&#x27; republic and world socialist revolution!&quot;. 

In July 2021, the Labour Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee banned Socialist Appeal and ruled that its members could be automatically expelled from the Labour Party.

On 14 November 2023, Socialist Appeal announced that the IMT within Great Britain would be refounded as the Revolutionary Communist Party. The founding congress of the party took place in May 2024.

== Publications ==

&quot;Socialist Appeal&quot; refers to the fortnightly newspaper of the same name. In September 2009, the publication &quot;Socialist Appeal&quot; changed from a magazine journal format to a full colour tabloid. As part of the establishment of the Revolutionary Community Party, the paper was merged with the Scottish IMT newspaper, &quot;Revolution,&quot; to form &quot;The Communist&quot; in January 2024.

The group also produced and/or published books, pamphlets, magazines and other Marxist educational material through the Wellred Books site operated by themselves.

&quot;Socialist Appeal&quot; was also the name of two British Trotskyist newspapers associated with Ted Grant in the 1940s: one was the newspaper of the Workers International League and immediately following that of the Revolutionary Communist Party.

== International Marxist Tendency ==

Socialist Appeal was part of the then International Marxist Tendency (now the Revolutionary Communist International). In Latin America, it supported President of Venezuela&#x27;s Hugo Chávez’s Bolivarian Revolution and the IMT instigated the formation of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign group to support Chávez.

The IMT ran the multilingual website &quot;In Defence of Marxism&quot;, which is now run by the RCI.

<doc id="341418" wikidata="Q503585" url="?curid=341418" title="Korea under Japanese rule">
<text>From 1910 to 1945, Korea was ruled by the Empire of Japan under the name Chōsen (), the Japanese reading of &quot;Joseon&quot;.

Japan first took Korea into its sphere of influence during the late 1800s. Both Korea (Joseon) and Japan had been under policies of isolationism, with Joseon being a tributary state of Qing China. However, in 1854, Japan was forcibly opened by the United States. It then rapidly modernized under the Meiji Restoration, while Joseon continued to resist foreign attempts to open it up. Japan eventually succeeded in opening Joseon with the unequal Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876.

Afterwards, Japan embarked on a decades-long process of defeating its local rivals, securing alliances with Western powers, and asserting its influence in Korea. Japan assassinated the defiant Korean queen and intervened in the Donghak Peasant Revolution. After Japan defeated China in the 1894–1895 First Sino–Japanese War, Joseon became nominally independent and declared the short-lived Korean Empire. Japan then defeated Russia in the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, making it the sole regional power. It then moved quickly to fully absorb Korea. It first made Korea a protectorate with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, and then ruled the country indirectly through the Japanese resident-general of Korea. After forcing Emperor Gojong to abdicate in 1907, Japan then formally colonized Korea with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910. The territory was then administered by the governor-general of Chōsen, based in Keijō (Seoul), until the end of the colonial period.

Japan made sweeping changes in Korea. Under the pretext of the racial theory known as &quot;Nissen dōsoron&quot;, it began a process of Japanization, eventually functionally banning the use of Korean names and the Korean language altogether. Tens of thousands of cultural artifacts were taken to Japan, and hundreds of historic buildings like the Gyeongbokgung and Deoksugung palaces were either partially or completely demolished. Japan also built infrastructure and industry. Railways, ports and roads were constructed, although in numerous cases workers were subjected to extremely poor working circumstances and discriminatory pay. While Korea&#x27;s economy grew under Japan, many argue that many of the infrastructure projects were designed to extract resources from the peninsula, and not to benefit its people. Most of Korea&#x27;s infrastructure built during this time was destroyed during the 1950–1953 Korean War.

These conditions led to the birth of the Korean independence movement, which acted both politically and militantly sometimes within the Japanese Empire, but mostly from outside of it. Koreans were also subjected to a number of mass murders, including the Gando Massacre, Kantō Massacre, Jeamni massacre, and Shinano River incident. While the international consensus is that these incidents all occurred, various Japanese scholars and politicians, including Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, either deny completely, attempt to justify, or downplay incidents such as these.

Beginning in 1939 and during World War II, Japan mobilized around 5.4 million Koreans to support its war effort. Many were moved forcefully from their homes, and set to work in generally extremely poor working conditions, although there was a range in what people experienced. Some Japanese politicians and scholars, including former prime minister Fumio Kishida, deny that Koreans were forced laborers, and instead claim that they were &quot;requisitioned against their will&quot; to work. Women and girls aged 12–17 were controversially forced into sexual slavery by Japan as &quot;comfort women&quot;. A number of modern Japanese scholars and politicians, notably from the far-right nationalist group Nippon Kaigi, of which Fumio Kishida and 57% of his cabinet are members, deny that they were forced to work at all, and claim that even the pubescent girls consented to sex work and were compensated reasonably. After the surrender of Japan at the end of the war, Korea was liberated, although it was immediately divided under the rule of the Soviet Union and of the United States.

The legacy of Japanese colonization was hotly contested even just after its end, and is still extremely controversial. There is a significant range of opinions in both South Korea and Japan, and historical topics regularly cause diplomatic issues. Within South Korea, a particular focus is the role of the numerous ethnic Korean collaborators with Japan, who have been variously punished or left alone. This controversy is exemplified in the legacy of Park Chung Hee, South Korea&#x27;s most influential and controversial president, who collaborated with the Japanese military and continued to praise it even after the colonial period. Until 1964, South Korea and Japan had no functional diplomatic relations, until they signed the Treaty on Basic Relations, which declared &quot;already null and void&quot; the past unequal treaties, especially those of 1905 and 1910. Despite this, relations between Japan and South Korea have oscillated between warmer and colder periods, often due to conflicts over the historiography of this era.

==Terminology==
During the period of Japanese colonial rule, Korea was officially known as , although the former name continued to be used internationally.

In South Korea, the period is usually described as the &quot;Imperial Japanese compulsive occupation period&quot; (). Other terms, although often considered obsolete, include &quot;Japanese Imperial Period&quot; (), &quot;The dark Japanese Imperial Period&quot; (), and &quot;Wae (Japanese) administration period&quot; ().

In Japan, the term has been used.

==Background==
===Political turmoil in Korea===
====Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876====
On 27 February 1876, the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 was signed. It was designed to open up Korea to Japanese trade, and the rights granted to Japan under the treaty were similar to those granted Western powers in Japan following the visit of Commodore Perry in 1854. The treaty ended Korea&#x27;s status as a protectorate of China, forced opening of three Korean ports to Japanese trade, granted extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens, and was an unequal treaty signed under duress (gunboat diplomacy) of the Ganghwa Island incident of 1875.

====Imo Incident====

The regent Daewongun, who remained opposed to any concessions to Japan or the West, helped organize the Mutiny of 1882, an anti-Japanese outbreak against Queen Min and her allies. Motivated by resentment of the preferential treatment given to newly trained troops, the Daewongun&#x27;s forces, or &quot;old military&quot;, killed a Japanese training cadre, and attacked the Japanese legation. Japanese diplomats, policemen, students, and some Min clan members were also killed during the incident. The Daewongun was briefly restored to power, only to be forcibly taken to China by Chinese troops dispatched to Seoul to prevent further disorder.

In August 1882, the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1882 indemnified the families of the Japanese victims, paid reparations to the Japanese government in the amount of 500,000 yen, and allowed a company of Japanese guards to be stationed at the Japanese legation in Seoul.

====Gapsin Coup====
The struggle between the Heungseon Daewongun&#x27;s followers and those of Queen Min was further complicated by competition from a Korean independence faction known as the Progressive Party (&quot;Gaehwa-dang&quot;), as well as the Conservative faction. While the former sought Japan&#x27;s support, the latter sought China&#x27;s support.

On 4 December 1884, the Progressive Party, assisted by the Japanese, attempted the Gapsin Coup, in which they attempted to maintain Gojong but replace the government with a pro-Japanese one. They also wished to liberate Korea from Chinese suzerainty. However, this proved short-lived, as conservative Korean officials requested the help of Chinese forces stationed in Korea. The coup was put down by Chinese troops, and a Korean mob killed both Japanese officers and Japanese residents in retaliation. Some leaders of the Progressive Party, including Kim Ok-gyun, fled to Japan, while others were executed. For the next 10 years, Japanese expansion into the Korean economy was approximated only by the efforts of tsarist Russia, but eventually would be annexed by Japan in 1910 (See Prelude to annexation)

====Donghak Revolution and First Sino-Japanese War====
The outbreak of the Donghak Peasant Revolution in 1894 provided a seminal pretext for direct military intervention by Japan in the affairs of Korea. In April 1894, Joseon asked for Chinese assistance in ending the revolt. In response, Japanese leaders, citing a violation of the Convention of Tientsin as a pretext, decided upon military intervention to challenge China. On 3 May 1894, 1,500 Qing forces appeared in Incheon. On 23 July 1894, Japan attacked Seoul in defiance of the Korean government&#x27;s demand for withdrawal, and then occupied it and started the Sino-Japanese War. Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War, and China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. Among its many stipulations, the treaty recognized &quot;the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea&quot;, thus ending Joseon&#x27;s tributary relationship with Qing, leading to the proclamation of the full independence of Joseon in 1895. At the same time, Japan suppressed the peasant revolt with Korean government forces.

====Assassination of Queen Min====
The Japanese minister to Korea, Miura Gorō, orchestrated a plot against 43-year-old Queen Min (later given the title of &quot;Empress Myeongseong&quot;), and on 8 October 1895, she was assassinated by Japanese agents. In 2001, Russian reports on the assassination were found in the archives of the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation. The documents included the testimony of King Gojong, several witnesses of the assassination, and Karl Ivanovich Weber&#x27;s report to Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, the Foreign Minister of Russia, by Park Jonghyo. Weber was the &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; at the Russian legation in Seoul at that time. According to a Russian eyewitness, Seredin-Sabatin, an employee of the king, a group of Japanese agents entered Gyeongbokgung, killed Queen Min, and desecrated her body in the north wing of the palace.

The Heungseon Daewongun returned to the royal palace the same day. On 11 February 1896, Gojong and the crown prince fled for protection at the Russian legation in Seoul, from which he governed for about a year.

=== Democracy protests and the proclamation of the Korean Empire ===

In 1896, various Korean activists formed the Independence Club. They advocated a number of societal reforms, including democracy and a constitutional monarchy, and pushed for closer ties to Western countries in order to counterbalance Japanese influence. It went on to be influential in Korean politics for the short time that it operated, to the chagrin of Gojong. Gojong eventually forcefully disbanded the organization in 1898.

In October 1897, Gojong returned to the palace Deoksugung, and proclaimed the founding of the Korean Empire at the royal altar Hwangudan. This symbolicly asserted Korea&#x27;s independence from China, especially as Gojong demolished a reception hall that was once used to entertain Chinese ambassadors in order to build the altar.

=== Prelude to annexation ===
Having established economic and military dominance in Korea in October 1904, Japan reported that it had developed 25 reforms which it intended to introduce into Korea by gradual degrees. Among these was the intended acceptance by the Korean Financial Department of a Japanese Superintendent, the replacement of Korean Foreign Ministers and consuls by Japanese and the &quot;union of military arms&quot; in which the military of Korea would be modeled after the Japanese military. These reforms were forestalled by the prosecution of the Russo-Japanese War from 8 February 1904, to 5 September 1905, which Japan won, thus eliminating Japan&#x27;s last rival to influence in Korea.

Frustrated by this, King Gojong invited Alice Roosevelt Longworth, who was on a tour of Asian countries with William Howard Taft, to the Imperial Palace on 20 September 1905, to seek political support from the United States despite her diplomatic rudeness. However, it was after exchanging opinions through the Taft–Katsura agreement on 27 July 1905, that America and Japan would not interfere with each other on colonial issues.

Under the Treaty of Portsmouth, signed in September 1905, Russia acknowledged Japan&#x27;s &quot;paramount political, military, and economic interest&quot; in Korea.

Two months later, Korea was obliged to become a Japanese protectorate by the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 and the &quot;reforms&quot; were enacted, including the reduction of the Korean Army from 20,000 to 1,000 men by disbanding all garrisons in the provinces, retaining only a single garrison in the precincts of Seoul. On 6 January 1905, Horace Allen, head of the American Legation in Seoul reported to his Secretary of State, John Hay, that the Korean government had been advised by the Japanese government &quot;that hereafter the police matters of Seoul will be controlled by the Japanese gendarmerie&quot; and &quot;that a Japanese police inspector will be placed in each prefecture&quot;. A large number of Koreans organized themselves in education and reform movements, but Japanese dominance in Korea had become a reality.

In June 1907, the Second Peace Conference was held in The Hague. Emperor Gojong secretly sent three representatives to bring the problems of Korea to the world&#x27;s attention. The three envoys, who questioned the legality of the protectorate convention, were refused access to the public debates by the international delegates. One of these representatives was missionary and historian Homer Hulbert. Out of despair, one of the Korean representatives, Yi Tjoune, committed suicide at The Hague. In response, the Japanese government took stronger measures. On 19 July 1907, Emperor Gojong was forced to relinquish his imperial authority and appoint the Crown Prince as regent. Japanese officials used this concession to force the accession of the new Emperor Sunjong following abdication, which was never agreed to by Gojong. Neither Gojong nor Sunjong were present at the &#x27;accession&#x27; ceremony. Sunjong was to be the last ruler of the Joseon dynasty, founded in 1392.

On 24 July 1907, a treaty was signed under the leadership of Lee Wan-yong and Ito Hirobumi to transfer all rights of Korea to Japan. This led to a large-scale righteous army movement among Koreans, and disbanded troops joined the resistance forces. Japan&#x27;s response to this was a scorched earth tactic using division-sized troops, which resulted in the movement of armed resistance organizations in Korea to Manchuria. Amid this confusion, on 26 October 1909, Ahn Jung-geun, a former volunteer soldier, assassinated Ito Hirobumi in Harbin.

Meanwhile, pro-Japanese populist groups such as the Iljinhoe helped Japan by being fascinated by Japan&#x27;s pan-Asianism, thinking that Korea would have autonomy like Austria-Hungary.
It was adopted as a representative consultant for Ryohei Uchida, and was used for propaganda with the support of the Japanese government. On 3 December 1909, he and Lee Wan-yong will issue a statement demanding the annexation of Korea.

However, the merger took place in the form of Japan&#x27;s annexation of Korean territory and was disbanded by Terauchi Masatake on 26 September 1910.

===Militant resistance===

During the prelude to the 1910 annexation, a number of irregular civilian militias called &quot;righteous armies&quot; arose. They consisted of tens of thousands of peasants engaged in anti-Japanese armed rebellion. After the Korean army was disbanded in 1907, former soldiers joined the armies and fought the Japanese army at Namdaemun. They were defeated, and largely fled into Manchuria, where they joined the guerrilla resistance movement that persisted until Korea&#x27;s 1945 liberation.

=== Military police ===
As Korean resistance against Japanese rule intensified, Japanese replaced Korean police system with their military police. Infamous Akashi Motojiro was appointed for the commander of Japanese military police forces. Japanese finally replaced Imperial Korean police forces in June 1910, and they combined police forces and military police, firmly establishing the rule of military police. After the annexation, Akashi started to serve as the Chief of Police. These military police officers started to have great authority over Koreans. Not only Japanese but also Koreans served as police officers.

==Japan–Korea annexation treaty (1910)==
In May 1910, the Minister of War of Japan, Terauchi Masatake, was given a mission to finalize Japanese control over Korea after the previous treaties (the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1904 and the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907) had made Korea a protectorate of Japan and had established Japanese hegemony over Korean domestic politics. On 22 August 1910, Japan effectively annexed Korea with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910 signed by Ye Wanyong, Prime Minister of Korea, and Terauchi Masatake, who became the first Governor-General of Chōsen.

The treaty became effective the same day and was published one week later. The treaty stipulated:
* Article 1: His Majesty the Emperor of Korea concedes completely and definitely his entire sovereignty over the whole Korean territory to His Majesty the Emperor of Japan.
* Article 2: His Majesty the Emperor of Japan accepts the concession stated in the previous article and consents to the annexation of Korea to the Empire of Japan.

Both the protectorate and the annexation treaties were declared already void in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea.

This period is also known as Military Police Reign Era (1910–19) in which Police had the authority to rule the entire country. Japan was in control of the media, law as well as government by physical power and regulations.

In March 2010, 109 Korean intellectuals and 105 Japanese intellectuals met in the 100th anniversary of Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910 and they declared this annexation treaty null and void. They declared these statements in each of their capital cities (Seoul and Tōkyō) with a simultaneous press conference. They announced the &quot;Japanese empire pressured the outcry of the Korean Empire and people and forced by Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910 and full text of a treaty was false and text of the agreement was also false&quot;. They also declared the &quot;Process and formality of &quot;Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910&quot; had huge deficiencies and therefore the treaty was null and void. This implied the March First Movement was not an illegal movement.

==Early years and expansion (1910–1941)==
===Japanese migration and land ownership===
From around the time of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, Japanese merchants started settling in towns and cities in Korea seeking economic opportunity. By 1908 the number of Japanese settlers in Korea was somewhere below the figure of 500,000, comprising one of the &quot;nikkei&quot; communities in the world at the time.


Many Japanese settlers showed interest in acquiring agricultural land in Korea even before Japanese land-ownership was officially legalized in 1906. Governor-General Terauchi Masatake facilitated settlement through land reform. The Korean land-ownership system featured absentee landlords, only partial owner-tenants and cultivators with traditional (but no legal proof of) ownership. By 1920, 90 percent of Korean land had proper ownership of Koreans. Terauchi&#x27;s new Land Survey Bureau conducted cadastral surveys that established ownership on the basis of written proof (deeds, titles, and similar documents). The system denied ownership to those who could not provide such written documentation; these turned out to be mostly high-class and impartial owners who had only traditional verbal cultivator-rights . Japanese landlords included both individuals and corporations (such as the Oriental Development Company). Because of these developments, Japanese landownership soared, as did the amount of land taken over by private Japanese companies. Many former Korean landowners, as well as agricultural workers, became tenant farmers, having lost their entitlements almost overnight because they could not pay for the land reclamation and irrigation improvements forced on them. Compounding the economic stresses imposed on the Korean peasantry, the authorities forced Korean peasants to do long days of compulsory labor to build irrigation works; Japanese imperial officials made peasants pay for these projects in the form of heavy taxes, impoverishing many of them and causing even more of them lose their land. Although many other subsequent developments placed ever greater strain on Korea&#x27;s peasants, Japan&#x27;s rice shortage in 1918 was the greatest catalyst for hardship. During that shortage, Japan looked to Korea for increased rice cultivation; as Korean peasants started producing more for Japan, however, the amount they took to eat dropped precipitously, causing much resentment among them.

By 1910 an estimated 7 to 8% of all arable land in Korea had come under Japanese control. This ratio increased steadily; as of the years 1916, 1920, and 1932, the ratio of Japanese land ownership increased from 36.8 to 39.8 to 52.7%. The level of tenancy was similar to that of farmers in Japan itself; however, in Korea, the landowners were mostly Japanese, while the tenants were all Koreans. As often occurred in Japan itself, tenants had to pay over half their crop in rent.

By the 1930s the growth of the urban economy and the exodus of farmers to the cities had gradually weakened the hold of the landlords. With the growth of the wartime economy throughout the Second World War, the government recognized landlordism as an impediment to increased agricultural productivity, and took steps to increase control over the rural sector through the formation in Japan in 1943 of the , a compulsory organization under the wartime command economy.

The Japanese government had hoped emigration to its colonies would mitigate the population boom in the &quot;naichi&quot;(内地), but had largely failed to accomplish this by 1936. According to figures from 1934, Japanese in Chōsen numbered approximately 561,000 out of a total population of over 21 million, less than 3%. By 1939 the Japanese population increased to 651,000, mostly from Japan&#x27;s western prefectures. During the same period, the population in Chōsen grew faster than that in the &quot;naichi&quot;. Koreans also migrated to the &quot;naichi&quot; in large numbers, especially after 1930; by 1939 there were over 981,000 Koreans living in Japan. Challenges which deterred Japanese from migrating into Chōsen included lack of arable land and population density comparable to that of Japan.

===Anthropology and cultural heritage===
Japan sent anthropologists to Korea who took photos of the traditional state of Korean villages, serving as evidence that Korea was &quot;backwards&quot; and needed to be modernized.

In 1925, the Japanese government established the Korean History Compilation Committee, and it was administered by the Governor-General and engaged in collecting Korean historical materials and compiling Korean history. According to the &quot;Doosan Encyclopedia&quot;, some mythology was incorporated. The committee supported the theory of a Japanese colony on the Korean Peninsula called Mimana, which, according to E. Taylor Atkins, is &quot;among the most disputed issues in East Asian historiography.&quot;

Japan executed the first modern archaeological excavations in Korea. The Japanese administration also relocated some artifacts; for instance, a stone monument (棕蟬縣神祠碑), which was originally located in the Liaodong Peninsula, then under Japanese control, was taken out of its context and moved to Pyongyang. As of April 2020, 81,889 Korean cultural artifacts are in Japan. According to the Overseas Korean Cultural Heritage Foundation, not all the artifacts were moved illegally. Adding to the challenge of repatriating illegally exported Korean cultural properties is the lack of experts in Korean art at overseas museums and institutions, alterations made to artifacts that obscure their origin, and that moving Korean artifacts within what was previously internationally recognized Japanese territory was lawful at the time. The South Korean government has been continuing its efforts to repatriate Korean artifacts from museums and private collections overseas.

The royal palace Gyeongbokgung was partially destroyed beginning in the 1910s, in order to make way for the Japanese General Government Building as well as the colonial Chōsen Industrial Exhibition. Hundreds of historic buildings in Deoksugung were also destroyed to make way for the . The displays in the museum reportedly intentionally contrasted traditional Korean art with examples of modern Japanese art, in order to portray Japan as progressive and legitimize Japanese rule. The National Palace Museum of Korea, originally built as the Korean Imperial Museum in 1908 to preserve the treasures in the Gyeongbokgung, was retained under the Japanese administration but renamed Museum of the Yi Dynasty in 1938.

The Governor-General instituted a law in 1933 in order to preserve Korea&#x27;s most important historical artifacts. The system established by this law, retained as the present-day National Treasures of South Korea and National Treasures of North Korea, was intended to preserve Korean historical artifacts, including those not yet unearthed. Japan&#x27;s 1871 Edict for the Preservation of Antiquities and Old Items could not be automatically applied to Korea due to Japanese law, which required an imperial ordinance to apply the edict in Korea. The 1933 law to protect Korean cultural heritages was based on the Japanese 1871 edict.

===Anti-Chinese riots of 1931===
Due to a waterway construction permit, in the small town of Wanpaoshan in Manchuria near Changchun, &quot;violent clashes&quot; broke out between the local Chinese and Korean immigrants on 2 July 1931. &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot;, a major Korean newspaper, misreported that many Koreans had died in the clashes, sparking a Chinese exclusion movement in urban areas of the Korean Peninsula. The worst of the rioting occurred in Pyongyang on 5 July. Approximately 127 Chinese people were killed, 393 wounded, and a considerable number of properties were destroyed by Korean residents. Republic of China further alleged the Japanese authorities in Korea did not take adequate steps to protect the lives and property of the Chinese residents, and blamed the authorities for allowing inflammatory accounts to be published. As a result of this riot, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Kijūrō Shidehara, who insisted on Japanese, Chinese, and Korean harmony, lost his position.

===Order to change names===

In 1911, the proclamation &quot;Matter Concerning the Changing of Korean Names&quot; (&quot;&quot;) was issued, barring ethnic Koreans from taking Japanese names and retroactively reverting the names of Koreans who had already registered under Japanese names back to the original Korean ones. By 1939, however, this position was reversed and Japan&#x27;s focus had shifted towards cultural assimilation of the Korean people; Imperial Decree 19 and 20 on Korean Civil Affairs (Sōshi-kaimei) went into effect, whereby ethnic Koreans were forced to surrender their traditional use of clan-based Korean family name system, in favor of a new surname to be used in the family register. The surname could be of their own choosing, including their native clan name, but in practice many Koreans received a Japanese surname. There is controversy over whether or not the adoption of a Japanese surname was effectively mandatory, or merely strongly encouraged.

==World War II==

===National Mobilization Law===
====Forcing of labor and migration====

From 1939, labor shortages as a result of conscription of Japanese men for the military efforts of World War II led to organized official recruitment of Koreans to work in mainland Japan, initially through civilian agents, and later directly, often involving elements of coercion. As the labor shortage increased, by 1942, the Japanese authorities extended the provisions of the National Mobilization Law to include the conscription of Korean workers for factories and mines in Korea, Manchukuo, and the involuntary relocation of workers to Japan itself as needed.

The combination of immigrants and forced laborers during World War II brought the total to over 2 million Koreans in Japan by the end of the war, according to estimates by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.

Of the 5,400,000 Koreans conscripted, about 670,000 were taken to mainland Japan (including Karafuto Prefecture, present-day Sakhalin, now part of Russia) for civilian labor. Those who were brought to Japan were often forced to work under conditions that have been described as appalling and dangerous. Although Koreans were reportedly treated better than laborers from other countries, large numbers still died. In Japan, 60,000 of the 670,000 mobilized laborers died. In Korea and Manchuria, estimates of deaths range between 270,000 and 810,000.

Korean laborers were also found as far as the Tarawa Atoll, where during the Battle of Tarawa only 129 of the 1200 laborers survived. According to testimonies in Japanese records, Korean laborers on the Mili Atoll were given &quot;whale meat&quot; to consume, which was actually human flesh from other dead Koreans. They rebelled after learning the truth, and were killed by the dozens in the aftermath. Korean laborers also worked in Korea itself, notably in Jeju where in the later stages of the Pacific War, Korean laborers expanded airfields and built facilities at Altteureu Airfield in order to block a US invasion of the Japanese mainland and in 1945 laborers on Songak Mountain (where several airstrips were located) were ordered to smooth down the slope in order to prevent American tanks being able to go up.

Most Korean atomic-bomb victims in Japan had been drafted for work at military industrial factories in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the name of humanitarian assistance, Japan paid South Korea four billion yen (approx. thirty five million dollars) and built a welfare center for those suffering from the effects of the atomic bomb.

====Korean service in the Japanese military====
Japan did not draft ethnic Koreans into its military until 1944 when the tide of World War II turned against it. Until 1944, enlistment in the Imperial Japanese Army by ethnic Koreans was voluntary, and highly competitive. From a 14% acceptance rate in 1938, it dropped to a 2% acceptance rate in 1943 while the raw number of applicants increased from 3000 per annum to 300,000 in just five years during World War II.

While the statistics appear to indicate that Koreans willingly joined the Japanese military, these numbers were artificially inflated using force. Japanese officials pressed illiterate peasants to sign applications and deliberately inflate statistics. This is also known in mainland Japan, and according to a 1941 survey, over half of applications were forced. The remaining applicants voluntarily applied due a variety of reasons, largely economic, while a small number were genuine supporters of Japan.


Other Korean officers who served Japan moved on to successful careers in post-colonial South Korea. Examples include Park Chung Hee, who became president of South Korea; Chung Il-kwon, prime minister from 1964 to 1970; Paik Sun-yup, South Korea&#x27;s youngest general who was famous for his command of the 1st Infantry Division during the defense of the Pusan Perimeter, and Kim Suk-won, a colonel of the Imperial Japanese Army who subsequently became a general of the South Korean army. The first ten of the Chiefs of Army Staff of South Korea graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and none from the Korean Liberation Army.

Officer cadets had been joining the Japanese Army since before the annexation by attending the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. Enlisted Soldier recruitment began as early as 1938, when the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria began accepting pro-Japanese Korean volunteers into the army of Manchukuo, and formed the Gando Special Force. Koreans in this unit specialized in counter-insurgency operations against communist guerillas in the region of Jiandao. The size of the unit grew considerably at an annual rate of 700 men, and included such notable Koreans as General Paik Sun-yup, who served in the Korean War. Historian Philip Jowett noted that during the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, the Gando Special Force &quot;earned a reputation for brutality and was reported to have laid waste to large areas which came under its rule.&quot;

Starting in 1944, Japan started the conscription of Koreans into the armed forces. All Korean men were drafted to either join the Imperial Japanese Army, as of April 1944, or work in the military industrial sector, as of September 1944. Before 1944, 18,000 Koreans passed the examination for induction into the army. Koreans provided workers to mines and construction sites around Japan. The number of conscripted Koreans reached its peak in 1944 in preparation for war. From 1944, about 200,000 Korean men were inducted into the army.

During World War II, American soldiers frequently encountered Korean soldiers within the ranks of the Imperial Japanese Army. Most notably was in the Battle of Tarawa, which was considered during that time to be one of the bloodiest battles in U.S. military history. A fifth of the Japanese garrison during this battle consisted of Korean laborers, where on the last night of the battle a combined 300 Japanese soldiers and Korean laborers did a last ditch charge. Like their Japanese counterparts, many of them were killed.

The Japanese, however, did not always believe they could rely on Korean laborers to fight alongside them. In &quot;Prisoners of the Japanese&quot;, author Gaven Daws wrote, &quot;[O]n Tinian there were five thousand Korean laborers and so as not to have hostiles &quot;at their back&quot; when the Americans invaded, the Japanese killed them.&quot;

After the war, 148 Koreans were convicted of Class B and C Japanese war crimes, 23 of whom were sentenced to death (compared to 920 Japanese who were sentenced to death), including Korean prison guards who were particularly notorious for their brutality during the war. The figure is relatively high considering that ethnic Koreans made up a small percentage of the Japanese military. Judge Bert Röling, who represented the Netherlands at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, noted that &quot;many of the commanders and guards in POW camps were Koreans – the Japanese apparently did not trust them as soldiers – and it is said that they were sometimes far more cruel than the Japanese.&quot; In his memoirs, Colonel Eugene C. Jacobs wrote that during the Bataan Death March, &quot;the Korean guards were the most abusive. The Japanese didn&#x27;t trust them in battle, so used them as service troops; the Koreans were anxious to get blood on their bayonets; and then they thought they were veterans.&quot;

Korean guards were sent to the remote jungles of Burma, where Lt. Col. William A. (Bill) Henderson wrote from his own experience that some of the guards overseeing the construction of the Burma Railway &quot;were moronic and at times almost bestial in their treatment of prisoners. This applied particularly to Korean private soldiers, conscripted only for guard and sentry duties in many parts of the Japanese empire. Regrettably, they were appointed as guards for the prisoners throughout the camps of Burma and Siam.&quot; The highest-ranking Korean to be prosecuted after the war was Lieutenant General Hong Sa-ik, who was in command of all the Japanese prisoner-of-war camps in the Philippines.

===Comfort women===
During World War II, many ethnic Korean girls and women (mostly aged 12–17) were forced by the Japanese military to become sex slaves on the pretext of being hired for jobs, such as a seamstresses or factory workers, and were forced to provide sexual service for Japanese soldiers by agencies or their families against their wishes. These women were euphemistically called &quot;comfort women&quot;.

According to an interrogation report by U.S. Army in 1944, comfort women were in good physical health. They were able to have a periodic checkup once a week and to receive treatment in case of spreading disease to the Japanese soldiers, but not for their own health. However, a 1996 United Nations Report detailed that &quot;large numbers of women were forced to submit to prolonged prostitution under conditions which were frequently indescribably traumatic&quot;. Documents which survived the war revealed &quot;beyond doubt the extent to which the Japanese forces took direct responsibility for the comfort stations&quot; and that the published practices were &quot;in stark contrast with the brutality and cruelty of the practice.&quot; Chizuko Ueno at Kyoto University cautions against the claim that women were not forced as the fact that &quot;no positive sources exist supporting claims that comfort women were forced labor&quot; must be treated with doubt, as &quot;it is well known that the great majority of potentially damaging official documents were destroyed in anticipation of the Allied occupation&quot;.

The Asian Women&#x27;s Fund claimed that during World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army recruited anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of women from occupied territories to be used as sex slaves. Yoshimi Yoshiaki asserted that possibly hundreds of thousands of girls and women, mainly from China and the Korean Peninsula but also Southeast Asian countries occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Australia and the Netherlands, were forced to serve as comfort women. According to testimonies, young women were abducted from their homes in countries under Imperial Japanese rule. In many cases, women were lured with promises of work in factories or restaurants. In some cases propaganda advocated equity and the sponsorship of women in higher education. Other enticements were false advertising for nursing jobs at outposts or Japanese army bases; once recruited, they were incarcerated in comfort stations both inside their nations and abroad.

From the early nineties onward, former Korean comfort women have continued to protest against the Japanese government for apparent historical negationism of crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, and have sought compensation for their sufferings during the war. There has also been international support for compensation, such as from the European Union, the Netherlands, Canada and the Philippines. The United States passed House of Representatives House Resolution 121 on 30 July 2007, asking the Japanese government to redress the situation and to incorporate comfort women into school curriculum. Hirofumi Hayashi at the University of Manchester argues that the resolution has helped to counter the &quot;arguments of ultrarightists flooding the mainstream mass media&quot; and warned against the rationalization of the comfort women system.

===Religion and ideology===

Protestant Christian missionary efforts in Asia were quite successful in Korea. American Presbyterians and Methodists arrived in the 1880s and were well received. They served as medical and educational missionaries, establishing schools and hospitals in numerous cities. In the years when Korea was under Japanese control, some Koreans adopted Christianity as an expression of nationalism in opposition to the Japan&#x27;s efforts to promote the Japanese language and the Shinto religion.
In 1914 of 16 million Koreans, there were 86,000 Protestants and 79,000 Catholics. By 1934 the numbers were 168,000 and 147,000, respectively. Presbyterian missionaries were especially successful. Harmonizing with traditional practices became an issue. The Protestants developed a substitute for Confucian ancestral rites by merging Confucian-based and Christian death and funerary rituals.

==Korean independence movement==
=== Guerrilla resistance in Manchuria and Russia ===
Since the early 1900s, Koreans in Manchuria and Primorsky Krai in Russia waged a guerrilla war against the Japanese occupation. The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1932 and subsequent Pacification of Manchukuo deprived many of these groups of their bases of operation and supplies. Many were forced to either flee elsewhere in China, or to join the Red Army-backed forces in eastern Russia. One of the most prominent guerrilla leaders in this region was the future leader of North Korea, Kim Il Sung. These experiences served as a base for Kim&#x27;s legitimacy after the liberation of Korea.

=== March First Movement ===
In January 1919, Emperor Gojong died suddenly, which led to widespread . Anti-Japanese sentiment flared amongst Koreans. In Tokyo, Korean students issued a February 8 Declaration of Independence that declared Korea independent from Japan. Inspired by this, Koreans in Seoul issued their own declaration of independence, which was prominently read aloud in Tapgol Park. This gave rise to the nation-wide March 1 Movement peaceful protests; it is estimated that 2 million people took part in these rallies. However, they were violently suppressed by Japan; according to Korean records, over a year of demonstrations, 46,948 were arrested, 7,509 killed and 15,961 wounded. According to Japanese figures, 8,437 were arrested, 553 killed and 1,409 wounded.

=== Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea ===
After the repression of the March 1st Movement protests, Koreans fled the peninsula. A number of them congregated in Shanghai a month after the protests and founded a government-in-exile: the Korean Provisional Government (KPG). The government was highly diverse, with both left- and right-leaning members, and engaged in a range of political and militant efforts that advocated for Korea&#x27;s independence. In 1931, member Kim Ku founded the Korean Patriotic Organization (KPO), a militant arm of the KPG. The KPO planned a number of attacks on Japanese government and colonial officials, including a 1932 assassination attempt on Emperor Hirohito and a bombing at a military rally in Shanghai. After the Shanghai bombing, they were forced to flee the city, and eventually settled in Chongqing, where they received support from the Chinese government. There, Kim Ku, then the leader of the KPG, founded the Korean Liberation Army (KLA). The army fought in China and Burma, and prepared for its return to Korea as the tide of World War II turned against Japan. This culminated in the Eagle Project, a mission for the KPG and KLA to return to the peninsula and fight the Japanese. Ultimately, with the surprise of the atomic bomb droppings on Nagasaki and Hiroshima and the sudden end of the war, the mission did not come to pass.

=== Resistance within Korea ===
Within Korea itself, anti-Japanese rallies continued on occasion. Most notably, the Kōshū Students Anti-Japanese Movement on 3 November 1929 led to the strengthening of Japanese military rule in 1931, after which freedom of the press and freedom of expression were curbed. Many witnesses, including Catholic priests, reported that Japanese authorities dealt with insurgency severely. When villagers were suspected of hiding rebels, entire village populations are said to have been herded into public buildings (especially churches) and massacred when the buildings were set on fire. In the village of Teigan, Suigen District, Keiki Prefecture (now Jeam-ri, Hwaseong, Gyeongggi Province) for example, a group of 29 people were gathered inside a church which was then set afire.

On 10 December 1941, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, under the presidency of Kim Ku, declared war on Japan and Germany.

==Independence and division of Korea==
Following the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Soviet invasion of Manchuria, and the impending overrun of the Korean Peninsula by U.S. and Soviet forces, Japan surrendered to the Allied forces on 15 August 1945, ending 35 years of Japanese colonial rule, though Japanese troops remained in Southern Korea for several more weeks until fully withdrawing by mid-September.

American forces under General John R. Hodge arrived at the southern part of the Korean Peninsula on 8 September 1945, while the Soviet Army and some Korean Communists had stationed themselves in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. U.S. Colonel Dean Rusk proposed to Chischakov, the Soviet military administrator of northern Korea, that Korea should be split at the 38th parallel. This proposal was made at an emergency meeting to determine postwar spheres of influence, which led to the division of Korea.

After the liberation of Korea from Japanese rule, the &quot;Name Restoration Order&quot; was issued on 23 October 1946 by the United States Army Military Government in Korea south of the 38th parallel, enabling Koreans to restore their names if they wished. Many Koreans in Japan chose to retain their Japanese names, either to avoid discrimination, or later, to meet the requirements for naturalization as Japanese citizens.

==Administrative divisions==

There were 13 provinces in Korea during Japanese rule: Keiki-dō, Kōgen-dō, Chūseihoku-dō, Chūseinan-dō, Zenrahoku-dō, Zenranan-dō, Keishōhoku-dō, Keishōnan-dō, Heian&#x27;nan-dō, Heianhoku-dō, Kōkai-dō, Kankyōnan-dō, and Kankyōhoku-dō. The administrative capital Keijō was in Keiki-dō.

==Economy==


Japan encouraged an inflow of Japanese capital to Korea&#x27;s less developed economy. A large majority of major firms in Korea became Japanese owned and operated as a result, with key positions reserved for Japanese. Koreans were permitted to work in menial roles under harsh labor conditions. Most of Korea&#x27;s coal, iron, and crop production was shipped to Japan.

Economic output in terms of agriculture, fishery, forestry and industry increased by tenfold from 1910 to 1945 as illustrated on the chart to the right. Princeton&#x27;s Atul Kohli concluded that the economic development model the Japanese instituted played the crucial role in Korean economic development, a model that was maintained by the Koreans in the post-World War II era.

Randall S. Jones wrote that &quot;economic development during the colonial period can be said to have laid the foundation for future growth in several respects.&quot;

A 2017 study found that the gradual removal of trade barriers (almost fully completed by 1923) after Japan&#x27;s annexation of Korea &quot;increased population growth rates more in the regions close to the former border between Japan and Korea than in the other regions. Furthermore, after integration, the regions close to Korea that specialized in the fabric industry, whose products were the primary goods exported from Japan to Korea, experienced more population growth than other regions close to Korea did.&quot;

There were some modernization efforts by the late 19th century prior to annexation. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to have electricity, trolley cars, water, telephone, and telegraph systems all at the same time, but Korea remained a largely backward agricultural economy around the start of the 20th century. &quot;Japan&#x27;s initial colonial policy was to increase agricultural production in Korea to meet Japan&#x27;s growing need for rice. Japan also began to build large-scale industries in Korea in the 1930s as part of the empire-wide program of economic self-sufficiency and war preparation.&quot; In terms of exports, &quot;Japanese industry as a whole gained little ... and this is certainly true for the most important manufacturing sector, cotton textiles. This export trade had little impact, positive or negative, on the welfare of Japanese consumer.&quot; Likewise in terms of the profitability of Japanese investors: colonial Korea made no significant impact.

According to scholar Donald S. Macdonald, &quot;for centuries most Koreans lived as subsistence farmers of rice and other grains and satisfied most of their basic needs through their own labor or through barter. The manufactures of traditional Korea – principally cloth, cooking and eating utensils, furniture, jewelry, and paper – were produced by artisans in a few population centers.&quot;

However, under Japanese rule, many Korean resources were only used for Japan. Economist Suh Sang-chul points out that the nature of industrialization during the period was as an &quot;imposed enclave&quot;, so the impact of colonialism was trivial. Another scholar, Song Byung-nak, states that the economic condition of average Koreans deteriorated during the period despite the economic growth. Cha primarily attributed this deterioration to global economic shocks and laissez-faire policies, as well as Chōsen&#x27;s rapid population growth; the colonial government&#x27;s attempts to mitigate this problem were inadequate. Most Koreans at the time could access only a primary school education under restriction by the Japanese, and this prevented the growth of an indigenous entrepreneurial class. A 1939 statistic shows that among the total capital recorded by factories, about 94 percent was Japanese-owned. While Koreans owned about 61 percent of small-scale firms that had 5 to 49 employees, about 92 percent of large-scale enterprises with more than 200 employees were Japanese-owned.

In addition, 70% of the agricultural workers who made up most of Korea&#x27;s population at the time were reduced to tenants of Japanese and Korean landlords who purchased land at low prices, and they had to pay high rents of 50–70%. As a result, many Koreans left for Manchuria and settled down, becoming the foundation of Korean in China.

The Japanese government created a system of colonial mercantilism, requiring construction of significant transportation infrastructure on the Korean Peninsula for the purpose of extracting and exploiting resources such as raw materials (timber), foodstuff (mostly rice and fish), and mineral resources (coal and iron ore). The Japanese developed port facilities and an extensive railway system which included a main trunk railway from the southern port city of Pusan through the capital of Seoul and north to the Chinese border. This infrastructure was intended not only to facilitate a colonial mercantilist economy, but was also viewed as a strategic necessity for the Japanese military to control Korea and to move large numbers of troops and materials to the Chinese border at short notice.

From the late 1920s and into the 1930s, particularly during the tenure of Japanese Governor-General Kazushige Ugaki, concentrated efforts were made to build up the industrial base in Korea. This was especially true in the areas of heavy industry, such as chemical plants and steel mills, and munitions production. The Japanese military felt it would be beneficial to have production closer to the source of raw materials and closer to potential front lines for a future war with China.

Lee Young-hoon, a professor at Seoul National University states that less than 10% of arable land actually came under Japanese control and rice was normally traded, not robbed. He also insists that Koreans&#x27; knowledge about the era under Japanese rule is mostly made up by later educators. Many of Lee&#x27;s arguments, however, have been contested.

Alleyne Ireland, a British author, referred to conditions in Korea under Japanese rule in 1926. He wrote in his book &quot;The New Korea&quot;, &quot;looking forward from 1910, one thing was clear where many things were obscure, namely that Japan, having decided to make Korea part of her Empire, would deem the permanence of her occupation to be a major element of her national policy, to be held intact, at whatever cost, against internal revolt or foreign intrigue. The Japanese refer with pride to their effective protection of life and property throughout a country but recently overrun by bandits, to the enormous increase during the past fifteen years in every branch of production, with its connotation of increased employment for Koreans, to the constantly mounting number of Koreans appointed to the government service are facts, that cannot be gainsaid. However, the Korean nationalists attribute to them a sinister significance.&quot;

=== Drug trade ===

Korea produced a small amount of opium during the earlier years of the colonial period, but by the 1930s, Korea became a major exporter of both opium and narcotics, becoming a significant supplier to the illicit drug trade, specifically to the opium monopoly created by the Japanese-sponsored Manchukuo government. The Government-General developed facilities dedicated to the production of morphine and heroin. Emigrant Koreans played an extensive role in drug trafficking in China, especially in Manchuria, where they were employed as poppy farmers, drug peddlers, or proprietors of opium dens — disreputable jobs that were at the bottom rung of the drug trafficking ladder. The initiation of opium and narcotic production in Korea was motivated by the worldwide shortage of opium and Japan&#x27;s unfavorable environment for poppy cultivation, making the Japanese entirely dependent on foreign imports to meet domestic demand for medical opium. The Japanese discovered that Korea provided favorable climate and soil conditions for poppy cultivation; not only were the climate and soil conditions more suitable, but land and labor costs were lower than in Japan. Farmers in Korea were aware of the global demand for opium, and welcomed the idea of increasing the amount of land for poppy cultivation, an idea that was introduced to them by Japanese pharmaceutical companies. The sale and consumption of drugs were pervasive in Korea, where the country faced a substantial domestic drug abuse problem, appearing in the form of opium-smoking and morphine addiction. Within Korea, most illicit narcotics were supplied by Japanese druggists.

==Policies==

=== Motivation behind Japanese colonial policy ===
In Japan, attitudes toward Koreans were deeply shaped by the Nissen dōsoron (日鮮同祖論, &quot;Theory of Japanese-Korean Common Ancestry&quot;), which claimed Koreans and Japanese shared mythological ancestors: Susanoo (Koreans) and Amaterasu (Japanese). According to this theory, Koreans were inherently Japanese, though unaware of their true identity. This idea served as the ideological foundation for the colonial government’s assimilation policies, which aimed to fully incorporate Koreans as &quot;racial Japanese.&quot;

In a speech in February 1944, Governor-General Koiso used the Nihon Shoki to justify the campaign to erase Korean language, culture, and ethnic identity. He asserted that Koreans were descendants of Susanoo-no-Mikoto, younger brother of Amaterasu, the sun goddess and ancestral figure of the Japanese emperor and nation. According to the Nihon Shoki, Susanoo had been sent to Korea to rule, a narrative Koiso used to suggest Susanoo was the same figure as Dangun, Korea’s mythical founder. He further argued that Korea’s annexation in 1910 mirrored the &quot;divine land transfer&quot; (Kuni-yuzuri), where Susanoo’s descendant, Ōkuninushi, submitted to Ninigi, Amaterasu’s grandson, establishing a precedent for the subordination of Koreans (Susanoo’s descendants) to Japanese (Amaterasu’s descendants). Koiso frequently made use of wording that hoped for the colonial policy to help &quot;awaken&quot; Koreans to their &quot;true nature&quot; as Japanese.

Assimilation, however, did not mean equality. Koreans were to remain subordinate, as theorized by Imaizumi Teisuke, who compared the Japanese-Korean relationship to hierarchical bonds like man and woman, rider and horse. This religious ideology also explained the construction of Shinto shrines across Korea during wartime, seen as completing a divine ritual to secure Japan&#x27;s destiny.

As opposed to other occupied countries, Koreans were nominally granted Japanese citizenship, including passports, but they were denied basic rights like freedom of speech, assembly, and an independent press. By 1910, all Korean publications were banned, leaving only censored outlets run by the colonial government. Japan’s ultimate goal was to erase Korean identity entirely, making Koreans indistinguishable from the Japanese, much like the assimilation policies directed at the Ainu and Okinawans. However, modern research confirms that Korean remains distinct and unrelated to Japanese or other languages.

===Newspaper censorship===

In 1907, the Resident-General of Korea passed the Newspaper Act, which effectively prevented the publication of local papers. Only the English-language &quot;The Korea Daily News&quot; and its Korean-language counterpart &quot;Daehan Maeil Sinbo&quot; continued their publication, because they were run by the foreigner Ernest Bethell. However, after continued Japanese pressure on the paper&#x27;s staff and Bethell&#x27;s death in 1909, even these papers became owned by the Japanese government. The newspaper&#x27;s Korean-language successor, &quot;Maeil Sinbo&quot;, was subordinated to the Japanese-language &quot;Keijō Nippō.&quot; These two papers, along with the English-language newspaper &quot;The Seoul Press&quot;, were effectively backed by the colonial government. Concurrently, the colonial government published an official gazette, entitled the &quot;Government-General of Chōsen Gazette&quot;.

By 1910, the only major privately owned Korean newspaper allowed to publish was the &quot;Gyeongnam Ilbo&quot;. However, this paper was pressured to close by 1915, leaving only the &quot;Maeil Sinbo&quot; left. However, restrictions were eased upon the 1919 March First Movement and the policy, which led to the establishment of the historic Korean papers &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; and &quot;The Dong-A Ilbo&quot;.

In 1932, Japan relaxed restrictions on the publication of Korean newspapers. Despite this, the government continued to seize newspapers without warning: there are over a thousand recorded seizures between 1920 and 1939. Revocation of publishing rights was relatively rare, and only three magazines had their rights revoked over the entire colonial period. In 1940, as the Pacific War increased in intensity, Japan shut down all Korean language newspapers again.

===Education===

Following the annexation of Korea, the Japanese administration introduced a public education system modeled after the Japanese school system with a pyramidal hierarchy of elementary, middle and high schools, culminating at the Keijō Imperial University in Keijō. As in Japan itself, education was viewed primarily as an instrument of &quot;the Formation of the Imperial Citizen&quot; (황민화; 皇民化; &quot;Kōminka&quot;) with a heavy emphasis on moral and political instruction. Japanese religious groups such as Protestant Christians willingly supported the Japanese authorities in their effort to assimilate Koreans through education.

During colonial times, elementary schools were known as &quot;Citizen Schools&quot; (; ; &quot;kokumin gakkō&quot;) as in Japan, as a means of forming proper &quot;Imperial Citizens&quot; (황국민; 皇国民; &quot;kōkokumin&quot;) from early childhood. Elementary schools in South Korea today are known by the name &quot;chodeung hakgyo&quot; () (&quot;elementary school&quot;) as the term &quot;gukmin hakgyo/kokumin gakkō&quot; has recently become a politically incorrect term.

During the colonial period, Japan established an officially equal educational system in Korea, but it strictly limited the rate of coed education. After the Korean Educational Ordinance was published in 1938, this situation changed slightly. &quot;Primary education consisted of a mandated four years of primary school (&quot;futsu gakkō&quot;). Secondary education included four years of middle school for boys (&quot;koto&quot; &quot;futsu&quot; &quot;gakkō&quot;) and three years for girls (&quot;joshi&quot; koto &quot;futsu gakko&quot;) or two to three years of vocational school (&quot;jitsugyo gakkō&quot;). 1915, the Japanese announced the Regulations for Technical Schools (s&quot;enmon gakko kisoku&quot;), which legalized technical schools (&quot;senmon gakkō&quot;) as post-secondary educational institutions.&quot;

In addition, modernized (for the time) Korean educational institutions were excluded from the colonial system. 1911, Japanese government set The Regulations for Private Schools (&quot;Shiritsu gakko kisoku&quot;) which was aimed at undermining these facilities, which showed patriotic awakening.

The public curriculum for most of the period was taught by Korean educators under a hybrid system focused on assimilating Koreans into the Japanese Empire while emphasizing Korean cultural education. This focused on the history of the Japanese Empire as well as inculcating reverence for the Imperial House of Japan and instruction in the &quot;Imperial Rescript on Education&quot;.

Integration of Korean students into Japanese-language schools and Japanese students in Korean-language schools was discouraged but steadily increased over time. While official policy promoted equality between ethnic Koreans and ethnic Japanese, in practice this was rarely the case. Korean history and language studies would be taught side by side with Japanese history and language studies until the early 1940s under a new education ordinance that saw wartime efforts increased and the hybrid system slowly weakened.

One point of view is that, although the Japanese education system in Korea was detrimental towards Korea&#x27;s cultural identity, its introduction of public education as universal was a step in the right direction to improve Korea&#x27;s human capital. Towards the end of Japanese rule, Korea saw elementary school attendance at 38 percent. Children of elite families were able to advance to higher education, while others were able to attend technical schools, allowing for &quot;the emergence of a small but important class of well-educated white collar and technical workers ... who possessed skills required to run a modern industrial economy.&quot; The Japanese education system ultimately produced hundreds of thousands of educated South Koreans who later became &quot;the core of the postwar political and economic elite.&quot;

Another point of view is that it was only after the end of Japanese rule with World War II that Korea saw true, democratic rise in public education as evidenced by the rise of adult literacy rate from 22 percent in 1945 to 87.6 percent by 1970 and 93% by the late 1980s. Though public education was made available for elementary schools during Japanese rule, Korea as a country did not experience secondary-school enrollment rates comparable to those of Japan prior to the end of World War II.

For example, according to the statistics of the Japanese Government-General of Korea in 1944, which was prepared just before independence, only 8.5% of the total population entered elementary school, and the middle school enrollment rate was only 0.9%. The literacy rate was also very low, so only 30% of the population could read letters, compared to a sharp rise to 90% in 1955, 10 years after independence.

===Korean language===
In the initial phase of Japanese rule, students were taught in Korean in public schools established by ethnic Korean officials who worked for the colonial government. Prior to this period, Korean education relied heavily on Hanja, Chinese characters, for written communication. However, during this time the Korean language transitioned to a mixed Hanja–Korean script influenced by the Japanese writing system, where most lexical roots were written in Hanja and grammatical forms in Korean script. Korean textbooks from this era included excerpts from traditional Korean stories such as (興夫伝; Kōfuden).

In 1921, government efforts were strengthened to promote Korean media and literature throughout Korea and also in Japan. The Japanese government also created incentives to educate ethnic Japanese students in the Korean language. In 1928, the Korean Language Society inaugurated Hangul Day (9 October), which was meant to celebrate the Korean alphabet in the face of accelerating Japanization of Korean culture. 

Koreans were obliged to take Japanese names by 1932.

In 1933, the foundation of modern South and North Korean spelling was completed.

The Japanese administrative policy shifted more aggressively towards cultural assimilation in 1938 (&quot;Naisen ittai&quot;) with a new government report advising reform to strengthen the war effort. Under this influence, in 1940, all Korean newspapers except the Japanese government&#x27;s official newspaper were eliminated. In 1942, Japanese authorities caused the Korean Language Society Incident and closed the society by applying suspicion of rebellion to scholars.

This left less room for Korean language studies and by 1943 all Korean language courses had been phased out. Teaching and speaking of Korean was prohibited. Although the government report advised further, more radical reform, the 10-year plan would never fully go into effect.

===Taking of historical artifacts===
The Japanese rule of Korea also resulted in the relocation of tens of thousands of cultural artifacts to Japan. This removal of Korean cultural property was against a long tradition of such actions dating at least since the sixteenth century wars between Korea and Japan, though in the 20th century colonial period it was a systematised and regulated activity covered by rules issued 1916–1933.

The issue over where these artifacts should be located began during the U.S. occupation of Japan. In 1965, as part of the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, Japan returned roughly 1,400 artifacts to Korea, and considered the diplomatic matter to have been resolved. Korean artifacts are retained in the Tōkyō National Museum and in the hands of many private collectors.

The primary building of Gyeongbokgung Palace was demolished and the Japanese General Government Building was built in its exact location. The Japanese colonial authorities destroyed 85 percent of all the buildings in Gyeongbokgung. Sungnyemun, the gate in Gyeongsong that was a symbol of Korea, was altered by the addition of large, Shinto-style golden horns near the roofs, later removed by the South Korean government after independence.

According to the South Korean government, there are 75,311 cultural artifacts that were taken from Korea. Japan has 34,369, the United States has 17,803, and France had several hundred, which were seized in the French campaign against Korea and loaned back to Korea in 2010 without an apology. In 2010, Prime Minister of Japan Naoto Kan expressed &quot;deep remorse&quot; for the removal of artifacts, and arranged an initial plan to return the Royal Protocols of the Joseon Dynasty and over 1,200 other books, which was carried out in 2011.

===Religion===
As Japan established the puppet state of Manchukuo, Korea became more vital to the internal communications and defense of the Japanese empire against the Soviet Union. Japan decided in the 1930s to make the Koreans become more loyal to the Emperor by requiring Korean participation in the State Shinto devotions, and by weakening the influences of both Christianity and traditional religion.

Shinto shrines were established throughout the peninsula, including Chōsen Shrine on the mountain Namsan in Seoul and Heijō Shrine in Pyongyang. Shrines such as these were destroyed shortly after Korea was liberated in 1945.

====Christianity and communism====

Protestant missionary efforts in Asia were nowhere more successful than in Korea. American Presbyterians and Methodists arrived in the 1880s and were well received. During the Japanese colonial period, Christianity became an expression of Korean nationalist opposition to Japan and its assimilation policies. In 1914, out of 16 million people, there were 86,000 Protestants and 79,000 Catholics; by 1934 the numbers were 168,000 and 147,000. Presbyterian missionaries were especially successful. Harmonizing with traditional practices became an issue. Catholics tolerated Shinto rites; Protestants developed a substitute for Confucian ancestral rites by merging Confucian-based and Christian death and funerary rituals.

Missionaries expressed alarm at the rise in communist activity during the 1920s. With the enactment of the Peace Preservation Law in 1925, communist literature was banned throughout the Empire of Japan, including Chōsen; in order to avoid suspicion and permit dissemination, it was often disguised as Christian literature addressed to missionaries. Communist concepts, such as class struggle, and its partner nationalist movement were resonating well with some of the peasants and lower-class citizens of Chōsen; this was worrying to some missionaries because of communism&#x27;s atheist components. At one point, communist students in Keijō held an &quot;anti-Sunday School conference&quot; and loudly protested religion in front of churches. This protest renewed Japanese governmental interest in censorship of communist ideas and language.

==Legacy==

=== Korean diaspora ===

A number of groups in the Korean diaspora formed because of the Japanese colonial period. Zainichi Koreans descend from the population of around 600,000 Koreans who remained in Japan, often not by choice. After Sakhalin was transferred from Japan to the Soviet Union, most of the 43,000 ethnic Koreans there were refused permission to repatriate back to Japan or Korea, and were thus trapped in Sakhalin. Many remained stateless. They now form the Sakhalin Korean population. Many Koreans had also escaped to Russia and the Soviet Union because of Japanese activities, and were eventually forced to move to Central Asia in 1937. They became a part of the population of Koryo-saram throughout the former Soviet Union.

===Forced laborers, comfort women, and Unit 731===

During World War II, about 450,000 Korean male laborers were involuntarily sent to Japan. Comfort women, who served in Japanese military brothels as a form of sexual slavery, came from all over the Japanese empire. Historical estimates range from 10,000 to 200,000, including an unknown number of Koreans. However, 200,000 is considered to be a conservative number by modern historians, and up to 500,000 comfort women are estimated to be taken. These women faced an average of 29 men and up to 40 men per day, according to one surviving comfort woman. However, of the 500,000, less than 50 are alive . Comfort women were often recruited from rural locales with the promise of factory employment; business records, often from Korean subcontractees of Japanese companies, showed them falsely classified as nurses or secretaries. There is evidence that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed official records regarding comfort women.

Koreans, along with many other Asians, were experimented on in Unit 731, a secret military medical experimentation unit in World War II. The victims who died in the camp included at least 25 victims from the former Soviet Union and Korea. Some historians estimate up to 250,000 total people were subjected to human experiments. A Unit 731 veteran attested that most that were experimented on were Chinese, Koreans, and Mongolians.

The Tokyo trials convened on 29 April 1946 to try Japanese personnel on Class A, B, and C charges for crimes against peace, conventional war crimes, and crimes against humanity respectively. Class C was created mainly to address atrocities committed by Japan against its nationals or allied citizens in times of peace or war since the law of war only covers enemy and neutral nationals in interstate armed conflicts. However, the principal Allied powers realized they had colonies themselves and never pressed on the Class C charges as they did not want to risk their own colonial atrocities being subject to prosecution. This left the Korean and Taiwanese victims of Japanese colonial atrocities without any recourse in the international legal system.

In 2002, South Korea started an investigation of Japanese collaborators. Part of the investigation was completed in 2006 and a list of names of individuals who profited from exploitation of fellow Koreans were posted. The collaborators not only benefited from exploiting their countrymen, but the children of these collaborators benefited further by acquiring higher education with the exploitation money they had amassed.

The &quot;Truth Commission on Forced Mobilization under the Japanese Imperialism Republic of Korea&quot; investigated the received reports of damage from 86 people among the 148 Koreans who were accused of being Class B and C criminals while serving as prison guards for the Japanese military during World War II. The commission, which was organized by the South Korean government, announced that they acknowledged 83 people among them as victims. The commission said that although the people reluctantly served as guards to avoid the draft, they took responsibility for the mistreatment by the Japanese against prisoners of war. Lee Se-il, leader of the investigation, said that examination of the military prosecution reports for 15 Korean prison guards, obtained from The National Archives of the United Kingdom, confirmed that they were convicted without explicit evidence.

===Result of the name changes===
Although officially voluntary, and initially resisted by the Japanese Colonial Government, 80% of Koreans voluntarily changed their name to Japanese in 1940. Many community leaders urged the adoption of Japanese names to make it easy for their children to succeed in society and overcome discrimination.

A study conducted by the United States Library of Congress states that &quot;the Korean culture was quashed, and Koreans were required to speak Japanese and take Japanese names&quot;. This name change policy, called sōshi-kaimei (; ), was part of Japan&#x27;s assimilation efforts. This was heavily resisted by the Korean people. Those Koreans who retained their Korean names were not allowed to enroll at school, were refused service at government offices, and were excluded from the lists for food rations and other supplies. Faced
with such compulsion, many Koreans ended up complying with the Name Change Order. Such a radical policy was deemed to be symbolically significant in the war effort, binding the fate of Korea with that of the empire.

===Discrimination against Korean leprosy patients by Japan===
Colonial Korea was subject to the same &quot;Leprosy Prevention Laws&quot; of 1907 and 1931 as the Japanese home islands. These laws directly and indirectly permitted the quarantine of patients in sanitariums, where forced abortions and sterilization were common. The laws authorized punishment of patients &quot;disturbing the peace&quot;, as most Japanese leprologists believed that vulnerability to the disease was inheritable. In Korea, many leprosy patients were also subjected to hard labor.
The Japanese government compensated inpatients.

===Atomic bomb casualties===

Many Koreans were drafted for work at military industrial factories in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. According to the secretary-general of a group named Peace Project Network, &quot;there were a total of 70,000 Korean victims in both cities&quot;. Japan paid South Korea 4 billion yen and built a welfare center in the name of humanitarian assistance, not as compensation to the victims.

===South Korean presidential investigation commission on pro-Japanese collaborators===
Collaborators of the Imperial Japanese Army were prosecuted in the postwar period as Chinilpa, or &quot;friendly to Japanese&quot;. In 2006 South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun appointed an investigation commission into the issue of locating descendants of pro-Japanese collaborators from the times of the 1890s until the collapse of Japanese rule in 1945.

In 2010, the commission concluded its five-volume report. As a result, the land property of 168 South Korean citizens has been confiscated by the government, these citizens being descendants of pro-Japanese collaborators.

=== Memorials ===
A number of memorials cover the legacy of the Japanese colonial period. The Independence Hall of Korea in Cheonan, Museum of Japanese Colonial History in Korea in Seoul, and the National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Occupation in Busan all cover the subject. The Trail of National Humiliation in Seoul passes by a number of the former sites of colonial-era buildings.

=== Modern justification of the colonization ===

Some conservative Japanese nationalists have since attempted to more positively portray the colonization and Japan&#x27;s intentions. Claims such as &quot;Japan did not want to annex Korea&quot; and &quot;Koreans came to Japan and asked to be annexed&quot; have been forwarded, and efforts are made to highlight Korea&#x27;s economic development during this period. However, the scholar Mark Caprio writes skeptically of such viewpoints:

<doc id="341420" wikidata="Q911664" url="?curid=341420" title="Standard enthalpy of reaction">
<text>The standard enthalpy of reaction (denoted formula_1) for a chemical reaction is the difference between total product and total reactant molar enthalpies, calculated for substances in their standard states. The value can be approximately interpreted in terms of the total of the chemical bond energies for bonds broken and bonds formed.

For a generic chemical reaction

:formula_2

the standard enthalpy of reaction formula_1 is related to the standard enthalpy of formation formula_4 values of the reactants and products by the following equation:

:formula_5

In this equation, formula_6 are the stoichiometric coefficients of each product and reactant. The standard enthalpy of formation, which has been determined for a vast number of substances, is the change of enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the substance from its constituent elements, with all substances in their standard states. 

Standard states can be defined at any temperature and pressure, so both the standard temperature and pressure must always be specified. Most values of standard thermochemical data are tabulated at either (25°C, 1 bar) or (25°C, 1 atm). 

For ions in aqueous solution, the standard state is often chosen such that the aqueous H+ ion at a concentration of exactly 1 mole/liter has a standard enthalpy of formation equal to zero, which makes possible the tabulation of standard enthalpies for cations and anions at the same standard concentration. This convention is consistent with the use of the standard hydrogen electrode in the field of electrochemistry. However, there are other common choices in certain fields, including a standard concentration for H+ of exactly 1 mole/(kg solvent) (widely used in chemical engineering) and formula_7 mole/L (used in the field of biochemistry). 

==Introduction==

Two initial thermodynamic systems, each isolated in their separate states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, can, by a thermodynamic operation, be coalesced into a single new final isolated thermodynamic system. If the initial systems differ in chemical constitution, then the eventual thermodynamic equilibrium of the final system can be the result of chemical reaction. Alternatively, an isolated thermodynamic system, in the absence of some catalyst, can be in a metastable equilibrium; introduction of a catalyst, or some other thermodynamic operation, such as release of a spark, can trigger a chemical reaction. The chemical reaction will, in general, transform some chemical potential energy into thermal energy. If the joint system is kept isolated, then its internal energy remains unchanged. Such thermal energy manifests itself, however, in changes in the non-chemical state variables (such as temperature, pressure, volume) of the joint systems, as well as the changes in the mole numbers of the chemical constituents that describe the chemical reaction.

Internal energy is defined with respect to some standard state. Subject to suitable thermodynamic operations, the chemical constituents of the final system can be brought to their respective standard states, along with transfer of energy as heat or through thermodynamic work, which can be measured or calculated from measurements of non-chemical state variables. Accordingly, the calculation of standard enthalpy of reaction is the most established way of quantifying the conversion of chemical potential energy into thermal energy.

==Enthalpy of reaction for standard conditions defined and measured==
The standard enthalpy of a reaction is defined so as to depend simply upon the standard conditions that are specified for it, not simply on the conditions under which the reactions actually occur. There are two general conditions under which thermochemical measurements are actually made.

: (a) Constant volume and temperature: heat formula_8, where formula_9 (sometimes written as formula_10) is the internal energy of the system
: (b) Constant pressure and temperature: heat formula_11, where formula_12 is the enthalpy of the system

The magnitudes of the heat effects in these two conditions are different. In the first case the volume of the system is kept constant during the course of the measurement by carrying out the reaction in a closed and rigid container, and as there is no change in the volume no work is involved. From the first law of thermodynamics, formula_13, where W is the work done by the system. When only expansion work is possible for a process we have formula_14; this implies that the heat of reaction at constant volume is equal to the change in the internal energy formula_15 of the reacting system.

The thermal change that occurs in a chemical reaction is only due to the difference between the sum of internal energy of the products and the sum of the internal energy of reactants. We have 

:formula_16

This also signifies that the amount of heat absorbed at constant volume could be identified with the change in the thermodynamic quantity internal energy.

At constant pressure on the other hand, the system is either kept open to the atmosphere or confined within a container on which a constant external pressure is exerted and under these conditions the volume of the system changes.
The thermal change at a constant pressure not only involves the change in the internal energy of the system but also the work performed either in expansion or contraction of the system. In general the first law requires that

:formula_17 (work)

If formula_18 is only pressure–volume work, then at constant pressure 

:formula_19

Assuming that the change in state variables is due solely to a chemical reaction, we have

:formula_20

:formula_21

As enthalpy or heat content is defined by formula_22, we have

:formula_23

By convention, the enthalpy of each element in its standard state is assigned a value of zero. If pure preparations of compounds or ions are not possible, then special further conventions are defined. Regardless, if each reactant and product can be prepared in its respective standard state, then the contribution of each species is equal to its molar enthalpy of formation multiplied by its stoichiometric coefficient in the reaction, and the enthalpy of reaction at constant (standard) pressure formula_24 and constant temperature (usually 298 K) may be written as 

:formula_25

As shown above, at constant pressure the heat of the reaction is exactly equal to the enthalpy change, formula_26, of the reacting system.

== Variation with temperature or pressure ==
The variation of the enthalpy of reaction with temperature is given by Kirchhoff&#x27;s Law of Thermochemistry, which states that the temperature derivative of ΔH for a chemical reaction is given by the difference in heat capacity (at constant pressure) between products and reactants:

:formula_27.

Integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature.

:formula_28

Pressure variation effects and corrections due to mixing are generally minimal unless a reaction involves non-ideal gases and/or solutes, or is carried out at extremely high pressures. The enthalpy of mixing for a solution of ideal gases is exactly zero; the same is true for a reaction where the reactants and products are pure, unmixed components. Contributions to reaction enthalpies due to concentration variations for solutes in solution generally must be experimentally determined on a case by case basis, but would be exactly zero for ideal solutions since no change in the solution&#x27;s average intermolecular forces as a function of concentration is possible in an ideal solution.

== Subcategories ==
In each case the word &quot;standard&quot; implies that all reactants and products are in their standard states.
* Standard enthalpy of combustion is the enthalpy change when one mole of an organic compound reacts with molecular oxygen (O2) to form carbon dioxide and liquid water. For example, the standard enthalpy of combustion of ethane gas refers to the reaction C2H6 (g) + (7/2) O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l).
* Standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of any compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The enthalpy of formation of one mole of ethane gas refers to the reaction 2 C (graphite) + 3 H2 (g) → C2H6 (g).
* Standard enthalpy of hydrogenation is defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts with an excess of hydrogen to become fully saturated. The hydrogenation of one mole of acetylene yields ethane as a product and is described by the equation C2H2 (g) + 2 H2 (g) → C2H6 (g).
* Standard enthalpy of neutralization is the change in enthalpy that occurs when an acid and base undergo a neutralization reaction to form one mole of water. For example in aqueous solution, the standard enthalpy of neutralization of hydrochloric acid and the base magnesium hydroxide refers to the reaction HCl (aq) + 1/2 Mg(OH)2 → 1/2 MgCl2 (aq) + H2O(l).

== Evaluation of reaction enthalpies==
There are several methods of determining the values of reaction enthalpies, involving either measurements on the reaction of interest or calculations from data for related reactions.

For reactions which go rapidly to completion, it is often possible to measure the heat of reaction directly using a calorimeter. One large class of reactions for which such measurements are common is the combustion of organic compounds by reaction with molecular oxygen (O2) to form carbon dioxide and water (H2O). The heat of combustion can be measured with a so-called bomb calorimeter, in which the heat released by combustion at high temperature is lost to the surroundings as the system returns to its initial temperature. Since enthalpy is a state function, its value is the same for any path between given initial and final states, so that the measured Δ&quot;H&quot; is the same as if the temperature stayed constant during the combustion.

For reactions which are incomplete, the equilibrium constant can be determined as a function of temperature. The enthalpy of reaction is then found from the van &#x27;t Hoff equation as formula_29. A closely related technique is the use of an electroanalytical voltaic cell, which can be used to measure the Gibbs energy for certain reactions as a function of temperature, yielding formula_30 and thereby formula_31.

It is also possible to evaluate the enthalpy of one reaction from the enthalpies of a number of other reactions whose sum is the reaction of interest, and these not need be formation reactions. This method is based on Hess&#x27;s law, which states that the enthalpy change is the same for a chemical reaction which occurs as a single reaction or in several steps. If the enthalpies for each step can be measured, then their sum gives the enthalpy of the overall single reaction. 

Finally the reaction enthalpy may be estimated using bond energies for the bonds which are broken and formed in the reaction of interest. This method is only approximate, however, because a reported bond energy is only an average value for different molecules with bonds between the same elements.

<doc id="341424" wikidata="Q2558322" url="?curid=341424" title="Trans Pennine Trail">
<text>The Trans Pennine Trail is a long-distance path running from coast to coast across Northern England on a mixture of surfaced paths, with some short on-road sections, and with gentle gradients (it runs largely along disused railway lines and canal towpaths). It forms part of European walking route E8 and is part of the National Cycle Network as Route 62 (referencing the M62 motorway which also crosses the Pennines).

Most of the surfaces and gradients make it a relatively easy trail, suitable for cyclists, pushchairs and wheelchair users. The section between Stockport and Barnsley is hilly, especially near Woodhead, and not all sections or barriers are accessible for users of wheelchairs or non-standard cycles. Some parts are also open to horse riding.

The trail is administered from a central office in Barnsley, which is responsible for promotion and allocation of funding. However, the 27 local authorities whose areas the trail runs through are responsible for management of the trail within their boundaries.

== History ==
The idea originated from Barnsley, where the head office is now based. Work on the trail started in 1999. Early development was boosted by a £5 million investment by the Millennium Commission. The trail was officially opened in September 2001. However, the route was not fully completed until late 2004. It cost £60 million to construct.

== Route ==
The main west–east trail starts at Southport, then heads south through the suburbs of Liverpool, through Widnes, Warrington, Manchester, Stockport and Hadfield. It then crosses the Peak District, heading up the Longdendale valley via the Longdendale Trail to Woodhead, then down through Dunford Bridge and Penistone, Doncaster, Selby, Hessle, Hull and Hornsea. This route covers . Between Southport and Selby it is National Cycle Network, Route 62 and from Selby to Hornsea, NCN Route 65.

There is also a north–south trail that runs from Leeds and through Wakefield. It then passes through Barnsley and crosses over the main trail in the Dearne Valley area. After that it continues south to Sheffield and the Rother Valley Country Park before terminating in Chesterfield. This is NCN Route 67 and is long.

The route also has several deviations and loops in South Yorkshire, including one to Rotherham, NCN Route 6 and NCN Route 627 south of Penistone. Another spur runs from Selby to York, NCN Route 65.

The cross-continent European walking route E8 uses the trail between Hull and Liverpool to cross England. It also crosses both the eastern and western routes of European walking route E2.

== Certificates ==

Certificates are handed out for covering different parts of the trail. In order to obtain them, trail users need to collect stamps at various points along the trail.

<text>Puretracks was a Canadian online music store, which launched officially on October 14, 2003. It became a division of Somerset Entertainment, owned by Fluid Music. Puretracks had U.S. and Canadian licensing agreements with a number of music labels, and offered a large number of music tracks for purchase and download.

The majority of music was sold at 256 to 320 kbit/s MP3 files.

As of February 20, 2007, Puretracks started offering the majority of its collection in MP3 format without DRM, an approach advocated by theories such as the Open Music Model.

Puretracks shut down in August, 2013.

==Mac compatibility==
Both the Puretracks Canadian and US stores are Mac compatible. Tracks and albums downloaded from the store are saved and downloaded into a music player.

==Puretracks Music Store==
The Puretracks music store was a digital music download store that operated in North America, offering more than 3.4 million tracks from artists.

It also offered multilingual music stores and customer support, with toggles between English and French in the Canadian music store, and a separate Latin music store (featuring Spanish and English toggles).

<text>In logic and mathematics, second-order logic is an extension of first-order logic, which itself is an extension of propositional logic. Second-order logic is in turn extended by higher-order logic and type theory.

First-order logic quantifies only variables that range over individuals (elements of the domain of discourse); second-order logic, in addition, quantifies over relations. For example, the second-order sentence formula_1 says that for every formula &quot;P&quot;, and every individual &quot;x&quot;, either &quot;Px&quot; is true or not(&quot;Px&quot;) is true (this is the law of excluded middle). Second-order logic also includes quantification over sets, functions, and other variables (see section below). Both first-order and second-order logic use the idea of a domain of discourse (often called simply the &quot;domain&quot; or the &quot;universe&quot;). The domain is a set over which individual elements may be quantified.

==Examples==
First-order logic can quantify over individuals, but not over properties. That is, we can take an atomic sentence like Cube(&quot;b&quot;) and obtain a quantified sentence by replacing the name with a variable and attaching a quantifier:

However, we cannot do the same with the predicate. That is, the following expression:

is not a sentence of first-order logic, but this is a legitimate sentence of second-order logic. Here, &quot;P&quot; is a predicate variable and is semantically a set of individuals.

As a result, second-order logic has greater expressive power than first-order logic. For example, there is no way in first-order logic to identify the set of all cubes and tetrahedrons. But the existence of this set can be asserted in second-order logic as:

We can then assert properties of this set. For instance, the following says that the set of all cubes and tetrahedrons does not contain any dodecahedrons:

Second-order quantification is especially useful because it gives the ability to express reachability properties. For example, if Parent(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) denotes that &quot;x&quot; is a parent of &quot;y&quot;, then first-order logic cannot express the property that &quot;x&quot; is an ancestor of &quot;y&quot;. In second-order logic we can express this by saying that every set of people containing &quot;y&quot; and closed under the Parent relation contains &quot;x&quot;:

It is notable that while we have variables for predicates in second-order-logic, we don&#x27;t have variables for properties of predicates. We cannot say, for example, that there is a property Shape(&quot;P&quot;) that is true for the predicates &quot;P&quot; Cube, Tet, and Dodec. This would require third-order logic.
==Syntax and fragments==

The syntax of second-order logic tells which expressions are well formed formulas. In addition to the syntax of first-order logic, second-order logic includes many new &quot;sorts&quot; (sometimes called &quot;types&quot;) of variables. These are:
* A sort of variables that range over sets of individuals. If &quot;S&quot; is a variable of this sort and &quot;t&quot; is a first-order term then the expression &quot;t&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot; (also written &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), or &quot;St&quot; to save parentheses) is an atomic formula. Sets of individuals can also be viewed as unary relations on the domain.
* For each natural number &quot;k&quot; there is a sort of variables that ranges over all &quot;k&quot;-ary relations on the individuals. If &quot;R&quot; is such a &quot;k&quot;-ary relation variable and &quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot; are first-order terms then the expression &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot;) is an atomic formula.
* For each natural number &quot;k&quot; there is a sort of variables that ranges over all functions taking &quot;k&quot; elements of the domain and returning a single element of the domain. If &quot;f&quot; is such a &quot;k&quot;-ary function variable and &quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot; are first-order terms then the expression &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot;) is a first-order term.
Each of the variables just defined may be universally and/or existentially quantified over, to build up formulas. Thus there are many kinds of quantifiers, two for each sort of variables. A &quot;sentence&quot; in second-order logic, as in first-order logic, is a well-formed formula with no free variables (of any sort).

It&#x27;s possible to forgo the introduction of function variables in the definition given above (and some authors do this) because an &quot;n&quot;-ary function variable can be represented by a relation variable of arity &quot;n&quot;+1 and an appropriate formula for the uniqueness of the &quot;result&quot; in the &quot;n&quot;+1 argument of the relation. (Shapiro 2000, p. 63)

Monadic second-order logic (MSO) is a restriction of second-order logic in which only quantification over unary relations (i.e. sets) is allowed. Quantification over functions, owing to the equivalence to relations as described above, is thus also not allowed. The second-order logic without these restrictions is sometimes called &quot;full second-order logic&quot; to distinguish it from the monadic version. Monadic second-order logic is particularly used in the context of Courcelle&#x27;s theorem, an algorithmic meta-theorem in graph theory. The MSO theory of the complete infinite binary tree (S2S) is decidable. By contrast, full second order logic over any infinite set (or MSO logic over for example (formula_2,+)) can interpret the true second-order arithmetic.

Just as in first-order logic, second-order logic may include non-logical symbols in a particular second-order language. These are restricted, however, in that all terms that they form must be either first-order terms (which can be substituted for a first-order variable) or second-order terms (which can be substituted for a second-order variable of an appropriate sort).

A formula in second-order logic is said to be of first-order (and sometimes denoted formula_3 or formula_4) if its quantifiers (which may be universal or existential) range only over variables of first order, although it may have free variables of second order. A formula_5 (existential second-order) formula is one additionally having some existential quantifiers over second order variables, i.e. formula_6, where formula_7 is a first-order formula. The fragment of second-order logic consisting only of existential second-order formulas is called existential second-order logic and abbreviated as ESO, as formula_5, or even as ∃SO. The fragment of formula_9 formulas is defined dually, it is called universal second-order logic. More expressive fragments are defined for any &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0 by mutual recursion: formula_10 has the form formula_6, where formula_7 is a formula_13 formula, and similar, formula_14 has the form formula_15, where formula_7 is a formula_17 formula. (See analytical hierarchy for the analogous construction of second-order arithmetic.)

==Semantics==
The semantics of second-order logic establish the meaning of each sentence. Unlike first-order logic, which has only one standard semantics, there are two different semantics that are commonly used for second-order logic: standard semantics and Henkin semantics. In each of these semantics, the interpretations of the first-order quantifiers and the logical connectives are the same as in first-order logic. Only the ranges of quantifiers over second-order variables differ in the two types of semantics.

In standard semantics, also called full semantics, the quantifiers range over &quot;all&quot; sets or functions of the appropriate sort. A model with this condition is called a full model, and these are the same as models in which the range of the second-order quantifiers is the powerset of the model&#x27;s first-order part. Thus once the domain of the first-order variables is established, the meaning of the remaining quantifiers is fixed. It is these semantics that give second-order logic its expressive power, and they will be assumed for the remainder of this article.

Leon Henkin (1950) defined an alternative kind of semantics for second-order and higher-order theories, in which the meaning of the higher-order domains is partly determined by an explicit axiomatisation, drawing on type theory, of the properties of the sets or functions ranged over. Henkin semantics is a kind of many-sorted first-order semantics, where there are a class of models of the axioms, instead of the semantics being fixed to just the standard model as in the standard semantics. A model in Henkin semantics will provide a set of sets or set of functions as the interpretation of higher-order domains, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions of that sort. For his axiomatisation, Henkin proved that Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem and compactness theorem, which hold for first-order logic, carry over to second-order logic with Henkin semantics. Since also the Skolem–Löwenheim theorems hold for Henkin semantics, Lindström&#x27;s theorem imports that Henkin models are just &quot;disguised first-order models&quot;.

For theories such as second-order arithmetic, the existence of non-standard interpretations of higher-order domains isn&#x27;t just a deficiency of the particular axiomatisation derived from type theory that Henkin used, but a necessary consequence of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem: Henkin&#x27;s axioms can&#x27;t be supplemented further to ensure the standard interpretation is the only possible model. Henkin semantics are commonly used in the study of second-order arithmetic.

Jouko Väänänen argued that the distinction between Henkin semantics and full semantics for second-order logic is analogous to the distinction between provability in ZFC and truth in &quot;V&quot;, in that the former obeys model-theoretic properties like the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem and compactness, and the latter has categoricity phenomena. For example, &quot;we cannot meaningfully ask whether the formula_18 as defined in formula_19 is the real formula_18 . But if we reformalize formula_19 inside formula_19, then we can note that the reformalized formula_19 ... has countable models and hence cannot be categorical.&quot;

==Expressive power==
Second-order logic is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, if the domain is the set of all real numbers, one can assert in first-order logic the existence of an additive inverse of each real number by writing ∀&quot;x&quot; ∃&quot;y&quot; (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = 0) but one needs second-order logic to assert the least-upper-bound property for sets of real numbers, which states that every bounded, nonempty set of real numbers has a supremum. If the domain is the set of all real numbers, the following second-order sentence (split over two lines) expresses the least upper bound property:
:: 
This formula is a direct formalization of &quot;every , set A .&quot; It can be shown that any ordered field that satisfies this property is isomorphic to the real number field. On the other hand, the set of first-order sentences valid in the reals has arbitrarily large models due to the compactness theorem. Thus the least-upper-bound property cannot be expressed by any set of sentences in first-order logic. (In fact, every real-closed field satisfies the same first-order sentences in the signature formula_24 as the real numbers.)

In second-order logic, it is possible to write formal sentences that say &quot;the domain is finite&quot; or &quot;the domain is of countable cardinality.&quot; To say that the domain is finite, use the sentence that says that every surjective function from the domain to itself is injective. To say that the domain has countable cardinality, use the sentence that says that there is a bijection between every two infinite subsets of the domain. It follows from the compactness theorem and the upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem that it is not possible to characterize finiteness or countability, respectively, in first-order logic.

Certain fragments of second-order logic like ESO are also more expressive than first-order logic even though they are strictly less expressive than the full second-order logic. ESO also enjoys translation equivalence with some extensions of first-order logic that allow non-linear ordering of quantifier dependencies, like first-order logic extended with Henkin quantifiers, Hintikka and Sandu&#x27;s independence-friendly logic, and Väänänen&#x27;s dependence logic.

==Deductive systems==

A deductive system for a logic is a set of inference rules and logical axioms that determine which sequences of formulas constitute valid proofs. Several deductive systems can be used for second-order logic, although none can be complete for the standard semantics (see below). Each of these systems is sound, which means any sentence they can be used to prove is logically valid in the appropriate semantics.

The weakest deductive system that can be used consists of a standard deductive system for first-order logic (such as natural deduction) augmented with substitution rules for second-order terms. This deductive system is commonly used in the study of second-order arithmetic.

The deductive systems considered by and add to the augmented first-order deductive scheme both comprehension axioms and choice axioms. These axioms are sound for standard second-order semantics. They are sound for Henkin semantics restricted to Henkin models satisfying the comprehension and choice axioms.

==Non-reducibility to first-order logic==

One might attempt to reduce the second-order theory of the real numbers, with full second-order semantics, to the first-order theory in the following way. First expand the domain from the set of all real numbers to a two-sorted domain, with the second sort containing all &quot;sets of&quot; real numbers. Add a new binary predicate to the language: the membership relation. Then sentences that were second-order become first-order, with the formerly second-order quantifiers ranging over the second sort instead. This reduction can be attempted in a one-sorted theory by adding unary predicates that tell whether an element is a number or a set, and taking the domain to be the union of the set of real numbers and the power set of the real numbers.

But notice that the domain was asserted to include &quot;all&quot; sets of real numbers. That requirement cannot be reduced to a first-order sentence, as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows. That theorem implies that there is some countably infinite subset of the real numbers, whose members we will call &quot;internal numbers&quot;, and some countably infinite collection of sets of internal numbers, whose members we will call &quot;internal sets&quot;, such that the domain consisting of internal numbers and internal sets satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as are satisfied by the domain of real numbers and sets of real numbers. In particular, it satisfies a sort of least-upper-bound axiom that says, in effect:

Countability of the set of all internal numbers (in conjunction with the fact that those form a densely ordered set) implies that that set does not satisfy the full least-upper-bound axiom. Countability of the set of all &quot;internal&quot; sets implies that it is not the set of &quot;all&quot; subsets of the set of all &quot;internal&quot; numbers (since Cantor&#x27;s theorem implies that the set of all subsets of a countably infinite set is an uncountably infinite set). This construction is closely related to Skolem&#x27;s paradox.

Thus the first-order theory of real numbers and sets of real numbers has many models, some of which are countable. The second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model, however.
This follows from the classical theorem that there is only one Archimedean complete ordered field, along with the fact that all the axioms of an Archimedean complete ordered field are expressible in second-order logic. This shows that the second-order theory of the real numbers cannot be reduced to a first-order theory, in the sense that the second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model but the corresponding first-order theory has many models.

There are more extreme examples showing that second-order logic with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. There is a finite second-order theory whose only model is the real numbers if the continuum hypothesis holds and that has no model if the continuum hypothesis does not hold. This theory consists of a finite theory characterizing the real numbers as a complete Archimedean ordered field plus an axiom saying that the domain is of the first uncountable cardinality. This example illustrates that the question of whether a sentence in second-order logic is consistent is extremely subtle.

Additional limitations of second-order logic are described in the next section.

==Metalogical results==
It is a corollary of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem that there is no deductive system (that is, no notion of &quot;provability&quot;) for second-order formulas that simultaneously satisfies these three desired attributes:

* (Soundness) Every provable second-order sentence is universally valid, i.e., true in all domains under standard semantics.
* (Completeness) Every universally valid second-order formula, under standard semantics, is provable.
* (Effectiveness) There is a proof-checking algorithm that can correctly decide whether a given sequence of symbols is a proof or not.

This corollary is sometimes expressed by saying that second-order logic does not admit a complete proof theory. In this respect second-order logic with standard semantics differs from first-order logic; Quine pointed to the lack of a complete proof system as a reason for thinking of second-order logic as not &quot;logic&quot;, properly speaking.

As mentioned above, Henkin proved that the standard deductive system for first-order logic is sound, complete, and effective for second-order logic with Henkin semantics, and the deductive system with comprehension and choice principles is sound, complete, and effective for Henkin semantics using only models that satisfy these principles.

The compactness theorem and the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem do not hold for full models of second-order logic. They do hold however for Henkin models.

==History and disputed value==

Predicate logic was introduced to the mathematical community by C. S. Peirce, who coined the term &quot;second-order logic&quot; and whose notation is most similar to the modern form (Putnam 1982). However, today most students of logic are more familiar with the works of Frege, who published his work several years prior to Peirce but whose works remained less known until Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead made them famous. Frege used different variables to distinguish quantification over objects from quantification over properties and sets; but he did not see himself as doing two different kinds of logic. After the discovery of Russell&#x27;s paradox it was realized that something was wrong with his system. Eventually logicians found that restricting Frege&#x27;s logic in various ways—to what is now called first-order logic—eliminated this problem: sets and properties cannot be quantified over in first-order logic alone. The now-standard hierarchy of orders of logics dates from this time.

It was found that set theory could be formulated as an axiomatized system within the apparatus of first-order logic (at the cost of several kinds of completeness, but nothing so bad as Russell&#x27;s paradox), and this was done (see Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory), as sets are vital for mathematics. Arithmetic, mereology, and a variety of other powerful logical theories could be formulated axiomatically without appeal to any more logical apparatus than first-order quantification, and this, along with Gödel and Skolem&#x27;s adherence to first-order logic, led to a general decline in work in second (or any higher) order logic.

This rejection was actively advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine. Quine advanced the view that in predicate-language sentences like &quot;Fx&quot; the &quot;x&quot; is to be thought of as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in &quot;For all things, it is the case that . . .&quot; but the &quot;F&quot; is to be thought of as an &quot;abbreviation&quot; for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property). For example, it might mean &quot; . . . is a dog.&quot; But it makes no sense to think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege&#x27;s own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name, which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by George Boolos.

In recent years second-order logic has made something of a recovery, buoyed by Boolos&#x27; interpretation of second-order quantification as plural quantification over the same domain of objects as first-order quantification (Boolos 1984). Boolos furthermore points to the claimed nonfirstorderizability of sentences such as &quot;Some critics admire only each other&quot; and &quot;Some of Fianchetto&#x27;s men went into the warehouse unaccompanied by anyone else&quot;, which he argues can only be expressed by the full force of second-order quantification. However, generalized quantification and partially ordered (or branching) quantification may suffice to express a certain class of purportedly nonfirstorderizable sentences as well and these do not appeal to second-order quantification.

== Relation to computational complexity==

The expressive power of various forms of second-order logic on finite structures is intimately tied to computational complexity theory. The field of descriptive complexity studies which computational complexity classes can be characterized by the power of the logic needed to express languages (sets of finite strings) in them. A string &quot;w&quot; = &quot;w&quot;1···&quot;wn&quot; in a finite alphabet &quot;A&quot; can be represented by a finite structure with domain &quot;D&quot; = {1...,&quot;n&quot;}, unary predicates &quot;Pa&quot; for each &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot;, satisfied by those indices &quot;i&quot; such that &quot;wi&quot; = &quot;a&quot;, and additional predicates that serve to uniquely identify which index is which (typically, one takes the graph of the successor function on &quot;D&quot; or the order relation &lt;, possibly with other arithmetic predicates). Conversely, the Cayley tables of any finite structure (over a finite signature) can be encoded by a finite string.

This identification leads to the following characterizations of variants of second-order logic over finite structures:
* REG (the regular languages) is the set of languages definable by monadic, second-order formulas (Büchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorem, 1960)
* NP is the set of languages definable by existential, second-order formulas (Fagin&#x27;s theorem, 1974).
* co-NP is the set of languages definable by universal, second-order formulas.
* PH is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas.
* PSPACE is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added transitive closure operator.
* EXPTIME is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added least fixed point operator.
Relationships among these classes directly impact the relative expressiveness of the logics over finite structures; for example, if PH = PSPACE, then adding a transitive closure operator to second-order logic would not make it any more expressive over finite structures.

<doc id="341431" wikidata="Q1002837" url="?curid=341431" title="Ford Prefect">
<text>The Ford Prefect is a line of British cars which was produced by Ford UK between 1938 and 1961 as an upmarket version of the Ford Popular and Ford Anglia small family cars. It was introduced in October 1938 and remained in production until 1941. Returning to the market in 1945, it was offered until 1961. The car progressed in 1953 from its original perpendicular or &quot;sit-up-and-beg&quot; style to a more modern three-box structure. Some versions were also built and sold by Ford Australia.

Like its siblings, the car became a popular basis for a hot rod, especially in Britain, where its lightweight structure and four-cylinder engines appealed to builders.

== E93A (1938–1949)==

The Ford Prefect was introduced in October 1938 and built by the Ford plant in Dagenham, Essex. The original Ford Prefect was a slight reworking of the previous year&#x27;s 7W, the first Ford car designed outside of Detroit, Michigan. It was designed specifically for the British market. It had a side-valve engine with thermosiphon cooling system (no pump) and with many other cars of the period, the ability to be started by a crank handle should the battery not have sufficient energy to turn the 6-volt starter motor. The windscreen wipers were powered by the vacuum ported from the engine intake manifold — as the car laboured uphill the wipers would slow to a standstill due to the intake manifold vacuum dropping to near nil, only to start working again as the top was reached and the intake vacuum increased. The windscreen opened forward pivoting on hinges on the top edge; two flaps either side of the scuttle also let air into the car. The car has a durable four-cylinder motor.

The most common body styles were two- and four-door saloons, but pre-war a few tourers and drophead coupés were made. Post-war, only four-door saloons were available on the home market, but two-door models were made for export.

41,486 were made up to 1941 and a further 158,007 between 1945 and 1948.

===Australian production===
The E93A was also produced in Australia with the Australian-built four-door saloon having an all-steel roof. Two-door saloon, tourer, 5cwt panel van, coupé utility and roadster utility models were also produced. In late 1939 the Australian Prefect models were recoded to E03A.
==E03A (Australia: 1939–1945)==

The E03A replaced the E93A in Australian production in 1939. The E03A saloon differed from the English E93A saloon in having an all-steel roof and stainless steel waistline trim.
== A53A (Australia: 1946-1948) ==

The A53A replaced the E03A in Australian production in 1946 with 4-door saloon, coupé utility and 5cwt delivery van versions produced. The A53A saloon differed from the E03A saloon in having an extended boot. From October 1947 the grille slates were chrome-plated.
==E493A (1949–1953)==

Post war, the Prefect design changed little until replaced in 1952. The headlamps moved into the wings and trafficators were fitted (internally lit semaphores springing out from the door pillars to signal left and right turns), though due to space restrictions these were left out on the Australian-built Ute. Only four-door saloons were available on the home market, the two-door sector being left to the Anglia but some were made for export.

The brakes remained mechanically operated using the Girling rod system with drums and the chassis still had transverse leaf springs front and rear.

A Prefect tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1948 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 22.8 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car which had the optional leather upholstery cost £412 including taxes. In standard form, they commented that it was the cheapest 4-door car on the British market.

192,229 were made.


== A493A (Australia: 1949–1953) ==

The A493A was an Australian produced variant of the English E493A which was offered in 4-door saloon and coupe utility variants. The A493A saloon differs from the E493A saloon in having a solid roof, an extended boot and a swage line on the front doors.
==100E (1953–1959)==

In 1953 a much redesigned Ford Prefect was introduced alongside the similar Ford Anglia and remained in production until 1959. Externally, the Prefect can be distinguished from the Anglia by having vertical bars on the radiator grille and four doors. The old separate chassis had gone, replaced by integral construction, and coil independent front suspension supplanted the transverse leaf spring. Girling hydraulic brakes were fitted, initially drums but quickly increased to A new side-valve engine of 1172 cc engine was fitted having the same bore, stroke and layout of the previous engine, but in all other respects completely different - changes included adjustable tappets, raising the compression ratio from 6.3:1 to 7:1 and larger inlet valves, resulting in the power output increasing by 20% to 36 bhp.

Inside there were separate front seats trimmed in PVC with leather as an option and two circular instruments in front of the driver one containing the speedometer and the other, fuel and water temperature gauges. De Luxe models from the second dashboard update in 1959 included glove box locks. The gear change was floor-mounted. The heater was an optional extra. The windscreen wipers were powered by the inlet manifold vacuum; when the engine was working hard, the vacuum fell away and the wipers slowed or stopped. The dashboard was revised twice; the binnacle surrounding the steering column was replaced by a central panel with twin dials towards the driver&#x27;s side in 1956; the last from 1959 had twin dials in a binnacle in front of the driver and AC &#x27;Vivid Arc&#x27; speedo similar to the 1957 E-series Vauxhall Velox/Cresta and &#x27;58/&#x27;59 PA models plus FB and EK Holdens.

In 1955 an estate car version was introduced, marketed as the Ford Squire and mechanically identical to the contemporary Escort, an estate car version of the Ford Anglia 100E, but with wooden strakes and a higher trim level.

The Motor magazine tested a de-luxe 100E in 1957 and recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 32.2 seconds. A &quot;touring&quot; fuel consumption of 33.1 miles per gallon (imperial) was recorded. On the home market it cost £658 including taxes of £220. 100,554 were made.


==107E (1959–1961)==

The Prefect 107E utilized a reworked 100E body with the then-new overhead valve engine, four-speed gearbox and &#x27;banjo&#x27; style rear end from the Anglia 105E, produced to offer a four-door model until replaced by the Ford Consul Classic. 38,154 were made, most of them (in UK production) in a two-tone colour scheme and deluxe trim.

Deluxe versions assembled in New Zealand had a rare &#x27;factory fitted&#x27; recirculating heater (dealer fit was almost universal at the time) and plush carpet.

Drum brakes of diameter were fitted, hydraulically operated, and the suspension was independent at the front using MacPherson struts. The rear driven axle used semi elliptic leaf springs. The steering mechanism used a worm and peg system.

On test, &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 27.2 seconds. A &quot;touring&quot; fuel consumption of 36 miles per gallon (imperial) was recorded. On the home market, it cost £621, including taxes of £183.

Optional extras included a heater, windscreen washers, radio and leather upholstery to replace the standard PVC.
== Exports and foreign production ==
In addition to the United Kingdom and Australia, Ford Prefects were also sold in the US, New Zealand (where they were locally assembled), Argentina and Canada. The Canadian model was left-hand drive. The Prefect was also license-built in Latvia by Ford-Vairogs as the Ford-Vairogs Junior. In Ireland, the Prefect was assembled at the Ford Cork plant until 1962. In South Africa, they were assembled locally at the Ford Struandale plant in Port Elizabeth. Singapore-based Ford of Malaya had also built the Prefect 100E with imported CKD kits.

== In popular culture ==
In the radio series, novelization, and film &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams, one of the main characters — an extra-terrestrial alien seeking to pose as a human — named himself &quot;Ford Prefect&quot; after the car, not realizing the name would be an unusual one for a human, having mis-identified cars as the dominante species on Earth.

Mohun Biswas, the main character in V. S. Naipaul&#x27;s novel, &quot;A House for Mister Biswas&quot; purchased an early 50&#x27;s Prefect as one of his few and prized possessions. It was a source of ridicule from family members but also representative of his limited upward mobility.

<doc id="341433" wikidata="Q488909" url="?curid=341433" title="Ancaster, Ontario">
<text>Ancaster is a community in the city of Hamilton in the Canadian province of Ontario. Founded in 1792, it immediately developed itself into one of the first significant and influential early British Upper Canada communities established during the late 18th century, eventually amalgamating with the city of Hamilton in 2001. By 1823, due to its accessible waterpower and location at the juncture of prehistoric trading routes, Ancaster had become Upper Canada&#x27;s largest industrial and commercial centre. Additionally, Ancaster had at that time attracted the 2nd largest populace (1,681) in Upper Canada, trailing only Kingston (population 2,500), but surpassing the populations of nearby Toronto (1,376) and Hamilton (1,000).

After this initial period of prosperity in the late 18th century, sudden significant water and rail transportation advancements of the early 19th century would soon better benefit Ancaster&#x27;s neighbouring towns nearer the Lake Ontario waterfront. Stationary steam engines for industries rapidly developing in the 19th century would eventually make Ancaster&#x27;s water-powered industries less vital. As a result, after the 1820s, Ancaster&#x27;s influence would begin to wane during the remainder of the 19th century.

From the late 19th century, Ancaster&#x27;s population would remain static until 1946, when new subdivisions around the village were established. The population expanded further with the completion of the Hamilton-Ancaster section of Highway 403 in 1968 and the introduction of sewer systems in 1974. After 1970, its population has grown steadily from 15,000 residents to its present-day count of 40,557. It was a municipality until 2001, when it was amalgamated with Hamilton, Dundas, Stoney Creek, Flamborough and Glanbrook to form the City of Hamilton.

== Geography, economy and population ==
Ancaster&#x27;s geography has had a very significant effect on human settlement patterns throughout its prehistory and in the present day. A highly influential geographical formation has been the Niagara Escarpment, which consists primarily of limestone formed from ancient, fossilized sea organisms that stretches from present-day New York State through Ontario to Illinois. The escarpment created the waterpower that encouraged early European settlers to gravitate to the area in the late 1700s. However, this energy source would not have been accessible if the escarpment had not been navigable. This long-meandering landform was an almost impassible transportation barrier for past indigenous cultures for thousands of years. However, a natural break in this escarpment in the precise area that would become Ancaster village had for millennia created an opportunity for people to traverse up and down the escarpment, providing a relatively easy navigable land transportation gateway from the head of the lake to the surrounding land on the escarpment and vice versa.
The former municipality had a population of 33,232 in the 2006 census, a considerable increase from the 2001 census of 27,485. Development in the historic village core has been tightly controlled. Its current population growth and building boom occur mainly on the east side of Highway 403 in such typically suburban commercial developments as the Power Centre and residential developments such as the Meadowlands. It has resided in the 905 area code since the latter&#x27;s creation, and its telephone exchange prefixes are 648 and 304, the majority being 648.

== History ==
The creation of the Upper and Lower Canadian provinces (colonies) from the division of the Province of Quebec (1763–1791) colony by the Parliament of Great Britain&#x27;s Constitutional Act of 1791 had a deciding influence on the timing of the founding of Ancaster. At its inception, Upper Canada was only sparsely settled (unlike the more established Lower Canada), and its land had not been officially surveyed to any great extent. Thus, there was an urgency by the then Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada John Graves Simcoe to survey this new and relatively barren province for establishing military roads and for preventing settlers from clearing and settling land not legally belonging to them. Predating Upper Canada, however, the earliest European settlers to arrive and clear land in the mid-18th century in what would eventually become Ancaster were mostly a wilderness society made up of American farmers travelling north searching for arable land and to a lesser extent French-speaking fur traders and British immigrants travelling southward. Also arriving at this area again travelling north in substantial numbers around 1787 with the incentive of inexpensive land grants were the United Empire Loyalists still loyal to the British crown who were fleeing from the United States after the 1776 American War of Independence. Britain&#x27;s promise of free land brought many people from the new republic to the south and east, who did not exhibit the same loyalty to the crown as the Loyalists. This would eventually lead to a series of defections, accusations and treasonous acts during the War of 1812 that precipitated the largest mass hangings in Canadian history, the so-called Bloody Assize of 1814 whose trial took place in Ancaster in 1814. When the United States invaded Upper Canada during the War of 1812, its occupants were primarily of American ancestry. However, after the war, the province would have a noticeably more British-centred influence. Britain expected its colonies to purchase all essential finished goods needed for day-to-day living from the mother country in exchange for raw materials such as fur and lumber. However, this &#x27;arrangement&#x27; naturally proved to be very inefficient and impractical in practice, so waterwheels, mills and factories soon hurriedly evolved in favourable towns in Upper Canada that had abundant waterpower, fertile soil, and good transportation access, such as Ancaster that could then provide the new settlers with a good measure of self-sufficiency.

In an age before steam power, the wilderness that would become Ancaster had an early economic advantage because it existed amidst a natural break in the Niagara Escarpment. Thus, even its relatively minor water resources were valuable because they were easily accessible. Just as vital an influence in Ancaster&#x27;s rapid development was that it already had access to two crucial prehistoric First Nations roads. The first European settlers to set foot in this region would have encountered the Iroquois Trail and the Mohawk Trail intersecting precisely in the area that would eventually become Ancaster Village. This aboriginal Iroquois trail had become the most critical transportation route in Upper Canada. It meandered down the escarpment from the future Ancaster into what would eventually become Hamilton, Ontario, towards present-day Lewiston, New York, eventually linking up with similar aboriginal trails in New York. In the other direction, the Iroquois trail led from present-day Ancaster to what would eventually become the town of Brantford, Ontario, at which point the trail branched off into the Detroit Path and the Long Point trail. By 1770, the 80-kilometre Mohawk Trail was essentially the escarpment accompaniment of the lakeside Iroquois trail. The Mohawk Trail ran parallel to the Iroquois Trail. It originated and diverged from the Iroquois Trail in present-day Queenston, Ontario, until finally ending and reconnecting to the Iroquois Trail in present-day Ancaster at what is now known as the intersection of Rousseaux and Wilson Street. The two trails had been interconnected in four locations along the Mohawk Trail&#x27;s 80-kilometre route when favourable escarpment conditions permitted. By 1785, the Iroquois Trail passing through present-day Ancaster had been widened to accommodate horse and buggy traffic. Another influential road that intersected the Mohawk Trail very close to Ancaster Village was the Twenty Mile Road that followed the Twenty Mile Creek up to present day Smithville, Ontario, and beyond. Lastly, Ancaster also had fertile soil and abundant fresh water, which encouraged pioneer settlers to arrive in this region to clear the land and plant crops for subsistence agriculture.
Ancaster was established formally in 1792, but the area now referred to as Ancaster Village had been referred to informally by local villagers by the more colourful name of Wilson&#x27;s Mills. This was in reference to millwright James Wilson, who, along with his affluent fur trader, entrepreneur and business partner Richard Beasley, were the primary founders of Ancaster village. With Beasley&#x27;s financial backing, Wilson built a gristmill in 1791 and a sawmill in 1792 that would be the only mills west of Grimsby for many years. To attract workers to his mills, Wilson needed to provide the social amenities and commercial framework for an area of land that, in that period, was an isolated frontier forest with accessible waterpower situated precisely at the juncture of already well-established pre-historical indigenous transportation trails. In that period, the area was populated with just a smattering of First Nations aboriginal peoples and wilderness farmers. Again, with Beasley&#x27;s financial assistance, Wilson managed to generate the impetus for a community by constructing a general store, a blacksmith shop, a distillery, and a tavern, all within walking distance of his mills. As a result, Wilson&#x27;s newly arrived employees began to build their homes near their place of work and thus the necessary factors were in place for the community of Wilson&#x27;s Mills to thrive. Wilson&#x27;s primary residence was also used as a school, a magistrate&#x27;s court and a cooperage. To this day, the main street that winds through the historical Ancaster Village that once was a section of the original aboriginal Iroquois Trail still bears the legacy of Wilson&#x27;s name. By 1793, an area containing Wilson&#x27;s Mills was finally surveyed and officially became known as Ancaster Township as chosen by John Graves Simcoe. Simcoe was apparently inspired in the name choice by Peregrine Bertie, the 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Thus, Wilson&#x27;s Mills was indirectly renamed Ancaster after the historic village in the county of Lincolnshire, England.

In 1794, Wilson sold his half share of the gristmill and sawmill business to Montreal-born fur trader, interpreter, businessman, militia officer and office holder Jean Rousseaux &quot;St. John&quot;, who already had a home and general store on Wilson Street. Rousseaux&#x27;s Ancaster general store experienced frequent trading with Joseph Brant&#x27;s Mohawks and other Iroquois people from the Six Nations confederacy located at the Grand River. Rousseaux would eventually buy out Beasley&#x27;s remaining share of the mills in 1797. Rousseaux had also been Governor Simcoe&#x27;s official native and French interpreter and was also a close confidante and advisor to native leader Joseph Brant. James Wilson at this point moved away and the local villagers by 1795 gradually began referring to the community of Wilson&#x27;s Mills as Ancaster Village. Curiously, the detailed whereabouts or activities of James Wilson after his departure are not well documented. There is evidence that Wilson was born before 1755, had a wife and three children but his burial location is unknown. With the profits from this business transaction Rousseaux built the Union Hotel in 1797 on Wilson Street, which is now remembered as the location of the Bloody Assize trials in 1814 during the War of 1812. By building his hotel on Wilson Street, Rousseaux reversed the trend of building exclusively on the Mohawk trail. In 1794-1797, Rousseaux also added a general store, brewery and distillery as well as hiring Ancaster&#x27;s first school teacher. His accomplishments include being the first assessor, tax collector, magistrate, and the Township&#x27;s first Lieutenant Colonel of the Militia. Rousseaux also became a considerable landowner, assisted significantly with native relations, was able to bridge French and English cultures successfully and was instrumental in the early development of Ancaster and old York. Rousseaux eventually resold the mills to the Union Mill Company in 1802, and they ultimately were destroyed by fire in 1812. However, the mills&#x27; brief 20 years of service (1791-1812) provided the initial catalyst for the economic and social development of Ancaster Township. Rousseaux died of pleurisy at Fort George (Niagara-on-the-Lake) during the War of 1812.

In 1798, the Hatt brothers Richard and Samuel from Dundas established their Red Mill downstream below Ancaster Falls at the base of the so-called &quot;devil&#x27;s elbow&quot;. They also widened the original native trail into what would eventually be known as the Old Ancaster-Dundas Road to provide better commercial access. In 1799, William Vanderlip built a hotel that, in 1844, was sold to Adam Duff. This gave birth to the nickname &#x27;Duff&#x27;s Corners&#x27; for describing this well-known intersection on Highway 53. By 1800, native mail couriers had been established between Montreal and Detroit, with Ancaster appointed as the branching point for Queenston. In 1805, the Hatt brothers bought most of the village site from James Wilson and subdivided it into streets and building lots. By 1810, the population of Ancaster had steadily risen to 400 residents, yet in just seven years, by 1817, its populace would more than double to 1,037. In that same year, Robert Gourlay carefully documented that Ancaster had 162 houses, four gristmills, five sawmills, 1 carding machine, 1 fulling mill, five doctors, 1 Anglican minister, and 1 Methodist meeting house. In 1820, Job Lodor acquired the Union Mill Company and rejuvenated Ancaster&#x27;s industrial base. By 1823, the first post office was established. In 1824, the Ancaster Union Church was built. By 1825, Ancaster had constructed a public reading room with papers from Niagara, York, and New York. A foundry that made ploughshares was established in 1825 by William Wiard. In 1826, Jacob Gabel started a tannery, Robert Douglas began a brewery, and John Galt established Ancaster as his headquarters for the Canada Company. 1827 marked the year that inaugurated the publication of George Gurnett&#x27;s Gore Gazette and the Ancaster, Hamilton, Dundas and Flamborough Advertiser. By 1835, Job Lodor was the only person in Upper Canada who managed to obtain banking privileges, and thus, the Gore Bank was established in the village in 1836. Also, in 1836, the population of Ancaster would reach 2,664. In 1837, a group of Red Coated Soldiers appeared in the village to announce the Mackenzie and Papineau rebellions. By 1840, Ancaster had five hotels. In 1844, Dr. Richardson opened his practice in the village. Eyre Thuresson founded a threshing machine factory in 1846, a stone mill in 1862, another card mill upstream in 1863 and reorganized the Cane Knitting Factory in 1865. In 1847, N. and E. Wiard re-opened the McLaughlin foundry to make ploughs. Harris and Alonzo Egleston arrived in 1832, began working at William Wiard&#x27;s foundry, and eventually bought him out. The Egleston&#x27;s then proceeded to expand their business empire, which included building a foundry in 1843 employing 25 people and rebuilding a gristmill in 1863 at the present-day location of the Old Ancaster Mill on the old Dundas Road. This Egleston mill was the 4th Ancaster mill and the third to be rebuilt at this current location. Wilson&#x27;s original mills burnt down in 1812. Upon rebuilding, Wilson&#x27;s mills were relocated from this original site at Wilson and Rousseaux Street a little further downstream and rebuilt in stone at the present Old Ancaster Mill location on Old Dundas Road. Again, a second mill burnt down in 1818 at this location, and a third was damaged by fire in 1854. Wilson&#x27;s original 1791-1792 mill foundations still exist 75 yards upstream from the Wilson and Rousseaux Street intersection but are hidden with vegetation. The restored and modified remnants of Egleston&#x27;s 1854 mill now operate as a restaurant and banquet hall. The Barracks of 1812 still stand as a reminder of the War of 1812. By May 1866, the first public telephone was set up in Gurnett&#x27;s store but was disconnected from lack of use.

By 1869, Ancaster was a village in the Township of Ancaster County Wentworth with a population of 500. Mr. K. Thuresson turned out card clothing. The Ancaster Knitting Company employed over 100 in the manufacture of knitted goods. Messrs. H &amp; A Egleston manufactured agricultural implements, cotton, and woollen machinery. Mr. A. Egleston employed 20 in woollen and cloth mills.

In 1871, the still-existing and well-maintained Ancaster Township Hall opened at an initial cost of $2,400. Additional examples of Victorian architecture are also located on Wilson Street, amongst them the Richardson residence, built in 1872 as a wedding present for Dr. Henry Richardson and his new bride, Sarah Egleston. Other similar structures include St. John&#x27;s Church 1869, the Gurnett Home 1826, Gurnett General Store 1826, Hammill House 1860, the Egleston House, Job Lodor&#x27;s Home 1820, Rousseau Hotel 1832 and the Thuresson Home 1872 to name just a few. The oldest building in Ancaster is the Tisdale house at 314 Wilson Street, which was built c. 1806 and whose current function is a police museum. The travelling expedition of Edison&#x27;s magical phonograph was exhibited in the Township Hall in 1878. In 1891, John Heslop was murdered in his home on Mineral Springs Road, and the murder case remains unsolved. After 1900, affluent Hamilton industrialists began purchasing farmland close to Ancaster village for building estates. By 1946, housing subdivisions began to be established around the village and thus started the post-World War II population expansion that continues to this present day with the current housing construction in the Meadowlands subdivision.

Ancaster&#x27;s dominant position in the region as an influential industrial, commercial, and farming community throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries would soon be short-lived due to sudden modern transportation advancements in its neighbouring towns. Soon nearby Dundas and a small farm settlement close to the lakefront that by 1833 would be established as the town of Hamilton would soon become more influential mainly because of the successful completion of the following three transportation projects: the completion of the Burlington Canal in 1832 that connected Burlington Bay (Hamilton Harbour) to Lake Ontario, the completion of the Desjardins Canal in 1837 that enabled lake vessels to enter nearby Dundas through Hamilton Harbour and the completion in 1855 of The Great Western Railway connection to Hamilton (and eventually Dundas) enabled Hamilton, which already had flourishing and expanding ports, to become the prominent urban and commercial settlement in the region. Another factor in Ancaster&#x27;s gradual economic decline was that stationary steam engines by the 1840s had begun powering industries; thus, locating industries adjacent to waterpower was less vital. In fact, by this period, even Ancaster had started introducing steam power to its factories; however, it could no longer compete economically with Hamilton&#x27;s natural shipping harbour and railway. A final contributing factor to Hamilton&#x27;s dominance was the fact it was chosen to be the administrative centre for the new Gore District in 1816 and was voted to be the county town instead of Ancaster. Ancaster had been the leading candidate in 1812 to be the county town, and a petition had been signed with 200 signatures to strengthen that proposal further. The petitioners had argued that Ancaster&#x27;s advantages were its flourishing Union Mills and other industries combined with its elegant setting, which they believed would make it the most suitable candidate for building a new county courthouse. However, the War of 1812 had interrupted this original selection process, and by 1816 the promising village of Hamilton was chosen instead even though Ancaster at that time was still the most influential village in Western Upper Canada.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Ancaster became an unimposing gristmill hamlet and police village. Ancaster&#x27;s many derelict, burnt down, or abandoned factories, such as the gutted four-story knitting mill and the ruined tannery littered its surroundings in that era like modern ruins that shouted at a former glory. The economic reality was that these former Ancaster factories would be rebuilt elsewhere. Ancaster would not have access to a modern transportation system until the Brantford and Hamilton Electric Railway intersected Ancaster Village in 1907, thus making fresh milk and other perishable foods, general supplies and mail easily deliverable daily for the first time. The arrival of the B&amp;H radial line corresponded with the inevitable process of change that Ancaster was undergoing that is recognizable today from that of a former prominent industrial and highly influential self-sufficient village to its current status as a bedroom community of Hamilton. The evidence for this radial train is still easily visible in Ancaster village by a well-maintained gravel path behind St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church on Wilson Street. Walkers and cyclists can still follow this old radial line path down the escarpment (behind Meadowlands Shopping Centre) to the Hamilton Chedoke Golf Course. The radial line was dismantled in 1931 as a condition of sale from the Cataract Company. With the advent of competition from the automobile and bus companies in North America at the turn of the 20th century, generally, only publicly owned streetcar companies had the financial means to survive into the 1950s.

At the end of the 19th century, the townsfolk of Ancaster were indeed conscious that their town had once been a glowing star in Upper Canada that had quickly lost its lustre during the Victorian age despite its second successful wave of industrialization in the 1820s. In 1897, local author Alma Dick-Lauder, writing about Ancaster in the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; using the colourful language of that time, lamented that:

So who can say that new life may not once more flow to the aged village, now high and dry on old time&#x27;s sand banks, bringing back her bright meridian bloom and vigour of 70 years ago? Fanned by the breath of electricity to spring like a Phoenix from her bed of ashes-ashes, understand, being principally the matter choking up the old place with a fire record unequalled since the days of Sodom, making her an object of terror to her friend, derision to her foes and a hoo-doo to the guileless insurance agent. It is rather melancholy, on a summer&#x27;s day, to stand on the high bridge and watch the waters slouching by like a gang of crystal dwarfs out of a job, idling and playing and painting the &#x27;beautiful, waving hair of the dead&#x27; grass green among the fallen ruins, which a few years ago were instinct with the hum of industry, pouring forth at stated hours, with jangle of bells, a cheerful, clattering stream of bread winners, giving life and animation to the scene, in contrast to the occasional man who now meets the casual glance up street in the sunny noon hours.

Alma Dick-Lauder was referring to the fact that by 1897, although Ancaster Township had a population of 4,000, the solitary industry remained Egleston&#x27;s gristmill. The &quot;fire record&quot; that Alma was referring to include the burning of the following: John J. Ryckman&#x27;s store in 1841, St. Johns Church in 1868, The Ancaster Knitting Factory in 1875, the Morris S. Lowrey Hotel in 1881, Egleston&#x27;s foundry in 1883, Thuresson&#x27;s Foundry in 1884 and finally the Ancaster Carriage Factory in 1885. By Alma&#x27;s expression of the &#x27;meridian bloom of 70 years ago&#x27;, she was referring to the fact that in 1820, Job Lodor had purchased the Union Mills and, in so doing, had instantly transformed Ancaster&#x27;s industrial centre to the point where it was once again, albeit temporarily, the unrivalled commercial and industrial hub of the Gore district. At the time of Alma&#x27;s 1897 newspaper article, Ancaster had gone from having three schools in 1835 to just one remaining school but had developed cultural institutions such as an orchestra, a literary society, and an enclosed curling rink. Job Lodor, as well as many other prominent as well as lesser-known early Ancaster settlers, left behind sometimes still legible tombstones and grave markers in the cemeteries belonging to St. John&#x27;s Anglican and St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Churches located on Wilson Street.

The Ancaster Fair has been an annual agricultural and social event since 1850, except for 1937, when it was cancelled due to a case of infantile paralysis and 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, the fair was held at Wilson and Academy Streets in the Village core. In 1894, it moved to Wilson and Cameron Drive driving park, where it remained until its centennial year in 1950 when it moved to Garner Road. After nearly 60 years at the Garner Road site, in 2009, the Ancaster Fair moved to 630 Trinity Road.

In 1976, an Ancaster Town Council vote reversed a long-standing policy that would finally allow Ancaster restaurants to apply for liquor licences. Other than the LCBO and Brewers Retail outlets that were established in Ancaster in the 1950s, the village had, up to that point, been &#x27;dry,&#x27; presumably since Prohibition in Canada. Ancaster&#x27;s earlier pioneers, however, experienced an entirely different social environment. Again, according to Dick-Lauder writing in 1897, &quot;Ancaster saw plenty of life during the rebellion of 1837 when it was quite a frequent thing for all the inns, five in number, and many of the private houses to be full overnight of redcoats passing towards the west.&quot;

During this period, Ancaster Township was attached variously to Nassau District, Home District, York County (West Riding) and Halton County. When Halton County and Wentworth County joined temporarily from 1850 to 1854, Ancaster remained permanently attached to Wentworth County, where it remains today in the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth
The Hermitage is a popular site in Ancaster. This historic house was once the property of Reverend George Sheed in 1830. Since then, the house had changed ownership many times before burning to the ground in 1934. The last owner of The Hermitage was, in fact, local author Alma Dick-Lauder, who has been referenced above. The fire that eventually consumed The Hermitage occurred directly from a party she had been hosting. The shell of the old house and surrounding buildings can still be visited today. One of the main draws of this old property is the legend of the property being haunted. &quot;Ghost tours&quot; run throughout the summer, with the tour guides telling haunted stories of the land and the surrounding county.
Griffin House is a historic house associated with the Underground Railroad.

== Government ==
When it became part of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth in 1974, the Town of Ancaster absorbed the Township of Ancaster (including other hamlets like Jerseyville, Lynden and Alberton). The new town had two representatives on the regional council, which totalled (with the Regional Chair) about 20 members.

It was amalgamated with the City of Hamilton in 2001. The amalgamation was unexpected, particularly since the Progressive Conservative MPP Toni Skarica government had promised in the last election that the amalgamation would not occur. Skarica resigned in protest, and a local Flamborough Mayor, Ted McMeekin, who led the fight in opposing the amalgamation, won the Liberal party nomination, winning the by-election on an anti-amalgamation platform. Nonetheless, the amalgamation was not rescinded by the Harris government.

Since the 2015 election, the community is in the Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas federal electoral district, represented by Filomena Tassi of the Liberal Party of Canada, and in the Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas provincial electoral district represented by Sandy Shaw of the Ontario New Democratic Party.

== Education ==
Ancaster was part of the Wentworth County Board of Education since its inception and was covered by the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board when it was created in 1998. The town&#x27;s only public secondary education institution was Ancaster High School until 2005. Today, it is no longer classified as a vocational school; its official name is Ancaster High School. Other secondary schools in Ancaster are Bishop Tonnos Secondary School, belonging to the Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board and Hamilton District Christian High School, an independent Christian high school that moved to Ancaster in 1989.

Public elementary schools in Ancaster include Frank Panabaker (formerly Fessenden), Rousseau, and Spring Valley (formerly C.H. Bray). In 2020, students in these schools began attending from kindergarten to Grade 8. The former Ancaster Senior public school for grades 7-8 then became the North campus of Frank Panabaker Elementary. However, the street east of the school retained the name Senior Drive. In the Catholic elementary school system, St. Ann&#x27;s, St. Joachim&#x27;s, Holy Name of Mary, and Immaculate Conception students (kindergarten to grade 8) generally end up at Bishop Tonnos Secondary School.

Postsecondary education is only available at Redeemer University, a Christian institution closely associated with the Christian Reformed Church. It was incorporated in 1980 and began classes in Hamilton two years later. It built a campus in Ancaster in 1986, where it had its first graduating class. It cooperated with McMaster University, providing some instructors and cross-listed courses. By 2000, it had acquired its present name, and its graduates obtained Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees instead of Bachelor of Christian Studies degrees.

The Ancaster Public Library, a branch of the Hamilton Public Library System, originated in 1955 as a member of the Library System of Ontario. It was eventually relocated to 300 Wilson Street East in 1967 as a Centennial project after several previous moves. The library was reopened on November 27, 2006, after an extensive project that extended the library to include the entire first floor of the building.

== Sports and recreation ==
The Hamilton Golf and Country Club was founded in 1894 and was initially sited beside the Hamilton Jockey Club (now Centre Mall), moving to Ancaster in 1916. It hosted the Canadian Open in 2003, 2006, 2012 and 2019.

The Ancaster Rotary Centre is an addition to Morgan Firestone Arena and includes a fitness centre and daycare. This complex is surrounded by the Robert E. Wade Park, which includes four baseball diamonds and five soccer fields. A 10.1-million-dollar addition of a second ice rink to Morgan Firestone Arena was completed in March 2011.

The Ancaster Little League Park is located on Jerseyville Road in Spring Valley, nestled on the edge of the Dundas Valley Conservation Area. There are three diamonds in Little League Park, known locally as T-Ball, Minor and Major. Beginning in 1970, Ancaster has hosted an annual (so-called) &#x27;World T-ball&#x27; tournament. In 2010 and 2019, Ancaster hosted the Canadian Little League Championships, and Little League Park was the main venue. Before hosting the Canadian Little League Championships, the central baseball diamond underwent a significant reconstruction. With help from the city, Province, and Federal Government, the diamond was rebuilt with proper drainage, professional-style clay base paths and warning track, a new PA system, and the construction of a new clubhouse.

Other recreational centres include:
* Morgan Firestone Arena
* Ancaster Rotary Centre
* Ancaster Tennis Club
* Ancaster Lions outdoor pool

== Nature ==
The Hamilton Conservation Authority (sometimes in conjunction with the City of Hamilton) operates several sites in Ancaster. Fieldcote Memorial Park and Museum showcases local history (including the area&#x27;s participation in the Underground Railway), fine arts, gardens and walking paths.

The Bruce Trail snakes through Ancaster as it links Queenston with Tobermory. The walking path goes through part of the Dundas Valley Conservation Area and crosses the Hamilton to Brantford Rail Trail.

<text>In the thermodynamics of equilibrium, a state function, function of state, or point function for a thermodynamic system is a mathematical function relating several state variables or state quantities (that describe equilibrium states of a system) that depend only on the current equilibrium thermodynamic state of the system (e.g. gas, liquid, solid, crystal, or emulsion), not the path which the system has taken to reach that state. A state function describes equilibrium states of a system, thus also describing the type of system. A state variable is typically a state function so the determination of other state variable values at an equilibrium state also determines the value of the state variable as the state function at that state. The ideal gas law is a good example. In this law, one state variable (e.g., pressure, volume, temperature, or the amount of substance in a gaseous equilibrium system) is a function of other state variables so is regarded as a state function. A state function could also describe the number of a certain type of atoms or molecules in a gaseous, liquid, or solid form in a heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture, or the amount of energy required to create such a system or change the system into a different equilibrium state.

Internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy are examples of state quantities or state functions because they quantitatively describe an equilibrium state of a thermodynamic system, regardless of how the system has arrived in that state. In contrast, mechanical work and heat are process quantities or path functions because their values depend on a specific &quot;transition&quot; (or &quot;path&quot;) between two equilibrium states that a system has taken to reach the final equilibrium state. Exchanged heat (in certain discrete amounts) can be associated with changes of state function such as enthalpy. The description of the system heat exchange is done by a state function, and thus enthalpy changes point to an amount of heat. This can also apply to entropy when heat is compared to temperature. The description breaks down for quantities exhibiting hysteresis.

==History==
It is likely that the term &quot;functions of state&quot; was used in a loose sense during the 1850s and 1860s by those such as Rudolf Clausius, William Rankine, Peter Tait, and William Thomson. By the 1870s, the term had acquired a use of its own. In his 1873 paper &quot;Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids&quot;, Willard Gibbs states: &quot;The quantities &quot;v&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;ε&quot;, and &quot;η&quot; are determined when the state of the body is given, and it may be permitted to call them &quot;functions of the state of the body&quot;.&quot;

==Overview==
A thermodynamic system is described by a number of thermodynamic parameters (e.g. temperature, volume, or pressure) which are not necessarily independent. The number of parameters needed to describe the system is the dimension of the state space of the system (). For example, a monatomic gas with a fixed number of particles is a simple case of a two-dimensional system (). Any two-dimensional system is uniquely specified by two parameters. Choosing a different pair of parameters, such as pressure and volume instead of pressure and temperature, creates a different coordinate system in two-dimensional thermodynamic state space but is otherwise equivalent. Pressure and temperature can be used to find volume, pressure and volume can be used to find temperature, and temperature and volume can be used to find pressure. An analogous statement holds for higher-dimensional spaces, as described by the state postulate.

Generally, a state space is defined by an equation of the form formula_1, where denotes pressure, denotes temperature, denotes volume, and the ellipsis denotes other possible state variables like particle number and entropy . If the state space is two-dimensional as in the above example, it can be visualized as a three-dimensional graph (a surface in three-dimensional space). However, the labels of the axes are not unique (since there are more than three state variables in this case), and only two independent variables are necessary to define the state.

When a system changes state continuously, it traces out a &quot;path&quot; in the state space. The path can be specified by noting the values of the state parameters as the system traces out the path, whether as a function of time or a function of some other external variable. For example, having the pressure and volume as functions of time from time to will specify a path in two-dimensional state space. Any function of time can then be integrated over the path. For example, to calculate the work done by the system from time to time , calculate formula_2. In order to calculate the work in the above integral, the functions and must be known at each time over the entire path. In contrast, a state function only depends upon the system parameters&#x27; values at the endpoints of the path. For example, the following equation can be used to calculate the work plus the integral of over the path:

:formula_3

In the equation, formula_4 can be expressed as the exact differential of the function . Therefore, the integral can be expressed as the difference in the value of at the end points of the integration. The product is therefore a state function of the system.

The notation will be used for an exact differential. In other words, the integral of will be equal to . The symbol will be reserved for an inexact differential, which cannot be integrated without full knowledge of the path. For example, will be used to denote an infinitesimal increment of work.

State functions represent quantities or properties of a thermodynamic system, while non-state functions represent a process during which the state functions change. For example, the state function is proportional to the internal energy of an ideal gas, but the work is the amount of energy transferred as the system performs work. Internal energy is identifiable; it is a particular form of energy. Work is the amount of energy that has changed its form or location.

<doc id="341442" wikidata="Q474881" url="?curid=341442" title="Cantor's theorem">
<text>In mathematical set theory, Cantor&#x27;s theorem is a fundamental result which states that, for any set formula_1, the set of all subsets of formula_2 known as the power set of formula_2 has a strictly greater cardinality than formula_1 itself. 

For finite sets, Cantor&#x27;s theorem can be seen to be true by simple enumeration of the number of subsets. Counting the empty set as a subset, a set with formula_5 elements has a total of formula_6 subsets, and the theorem holds because formula_7 for all non-negative integers.

Much more significant is Cantor&#x27;s discovery of an argument that is applicable to any set, and shows that the theorem holds for infinite sets also. As a consequence, the cardinality of the real numbers, which is the same as that of the power set of the integers, is strictly larger than the cardinality of the integers; see Cardinality of the continuum for details.

The theorem is named for Georg Cantor, who first stated and proved it at the end of the 19th century. Cantor&#x27;s theorem had immediate and important consequences for the philosophy of mathematics. For instance, by iteratively taking the power set of an infinite set and applying Cantor&#x27;s theorem, we obtain an endless hierarchy of infinite cardinals, each strictly larger than the one before it. Consequently, the theorem implies that there is no largest cardinal number (colloquially, &quot;there&#x27;s no largest infinity&quot;).

==Proof==
Cantor&#x27;s argument is elegant and remarkably simple. The complete proof is presented below, with detailed explanations to follow.


By definition of cardinality, we have formula_8 for any two sets formula_9 and formula_10 if and only if there is an injective function but no bijective function from formula_9 It suffices to show that there is no surjection from formula_9 . This is the heart of Cantor&#x27;s theorem: there is no surjective function from any set formula_1 to its power set. To establish this, it is enough to show that no function formula_14 (that maps elements in formula_1 to subsets of formula_1) can reach every possible subset, i.e., we just need to demonstrate the existence of a subset of formula_1 that is not equal to formula_18 for any formula_19. Recalling that each formula_18 is a subset of formula_1, such a subset is given by the following construction, sometimes called the Cantor diagonal set of formula_14:

:formula_23

This means, by definition, that for all formula_24, formula_25 if and only if formula_26. For all formula_27 the sets formula_28 and formula_18 cannot be equal because formula_28 was constructed from elements of formula_1 whose images under formula_14 did not include themselves. For all formula_24 either formula_34 or formula_26. If formula_34 then formula_18 cannot equal formula_28 because formula_34 by assumption and formula_40 by definition. If formula_26 then formula_18 cannot equal formula_28 because formula_26 by assumption and formula_25 by the definition of formula_28.

Equivalently, and slightly more formally, we have just proved that the existence of formula_47 such that formula_48 implies the following contradiction:

:formula_49

Therefore, by reductio ad absurdum, the assumption must be false. Thus there is no formula_47 such that formula_48 ; in other words, formula_28 is not in the image of formula_14 and formula_14 does not map onto every element of the power set of formula_1, i.e., formula_14 is not surjective.

Finally, to complete the proof, we need to exhibit an injective function from formula_1 to its power set. Finding such a function is trivial: just map formula_27 to the singleton set formula_59. The argument is now complete, and we have established the strict inequality for any set formula_1 that formula_61.

Another way to think of the proof is that formula_28, empty or non-empty, is always in the power set of formula_1. For formula_14 to be onto, some element of formula_1 must map to formula_28. But that leads to a contradiction: no element of formula_28 can map to formula_28 because that would contradict the criterion of membership in formula_28, thus the element mapping to formula_28 must not be an element of formula_28 meaning that it satisfies the criterion for membership in formula_28, another contradiction. So the assumption that an element of formula_1 maps to formula_28 must be false; and formula_14 cannot be onto.

Because of the double occurrence of formula_27 in the expression &quot;formula_34&quot;, this is a diagonal argument. For a countable (or finite) set, the argument of the proof given above can be illustrated by constructing a table in which
# each row is labelled by a unique formula_27 from formula_79, in this order. formula_1 is assumed to admit a linear order so that such table can be constructed.
# each column of the table is labelled by a unique formula_81 from the power set of formula_1; the columns are ordered by the argument to formula_14, i.e. the column labels are formula_84, ..., in this order.
# the intersection of each row formula_27 and column formula_81 records a true/false bit whether formula_87.
Given the order chosen for the row and column labels, the main diagonal formula_88 of this table thus records whether formula_34 for each formula_24. One such table will be the following:
formula_91
The set formula_28 constructed in the previous paragraphs coincides with the row labels for the subset of entries on this main diagonal formula_88 (which in above example, coloured red) where the table records that formula_34 is false. Each row records the values of the indicator function of the set corresponding to the column. The indicator function of formula_28 coincides with the logically negated (swap &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;) entries of the main diagonal. Thus the indicator function of formula_28 does not agree with any column in at least one entry. Consequently, no column represents formula_28.

Despite the simplicity of the above proof, it is rather difficult for an automated theorem prover to produce it. The main difficulty lies in an automated discovery of the Cantor diagonal set. Lawrence Paulson noted in 1992 that Otter could not do it, whereas Isabelle could, albeit with a certain amount of direction in terms of tactics that might perhaps be considered cheating.

==When &quot;A&quot; is countably infinite==
Let us examine the proof for the specific case when formula_1 is countably infinite. Without loss of generality, we may take formula_99, the set of natural numbers.

Suppose that formula_100 is equinumerous with its power set formula_101. Let us see a sample of what formula_101 looks like:

:formula_103

Indeed, formula_101 contains infinite subsets of formula_100, e.g. the set of all positive even numbers formula_106, along with the empty set formula_107.

Now that we have an idea of what the elements of formula_101 are, let us attempt to pair off each element of formula_100 with each element of formula_101 to show that these infinite sets are equinumerous. In other words, we will attempt to pair off each element of formula_100 with an element from the infinite set formula_101, so that no element from either infinite set remains unpaired. Such an attempt to pair elements would look like this:

:formula_113

Given such a pairing, some natural numbers are paired with subsets that contain the very same number. For instance, in our example the number 2 is paired with the subset {1, 2, 3}, which contains 2 as a member. Let us call such numbers &quot;selfish&quot;. Other natural numbers are paired with subsets that do not contain them. For instance, in our example the number 1 is paired with the subset {4, 5}, which does not contain the number 1. Call these numbers &quot;non-selfish&quot;. Likewise, 3 and 4 are non-selfish.

Using this idea, let us build a special set of natural numbers. This set will provide the contradiction we seek. Let formula_28 be the set of &quot;all&quot; non-selfish natural numbers. By definition, the power set formula_101 contains all sets of natural numbers, and so it contains this set formula_28 as an element. If the mapping is bijective, formula_28 must be paired off with some natural number, say formula_118. However, this causes a problem. If formula_118 is in formula_28, then formula_118 is selfish because it is in the corresponding set, which contradicts the definition of formula_28. If formula_118 is not in formula_28, then it is non-selfish and it should instead be a member of formula_28. Therefore, no such element formula_118 which maps to formula_28 can exist.

Since there is no natural number which can be paired with formula_28, we have contradicted our original supposition, that there is a bijection between formula_100 and formula_101.

Note that the set formula_28 may be empty. This would mean that every natural number formula_27 maps to a subset of natural numbers that contains formula_27. Then, every number maps to a nonempty set and no number maps to the empty set. But the empty set is a member of formula_101, so the mapping still does not cover formula_101.

Through this proof by contradiction we have proven that the cardinality of formula_100 and formula_101 cannot be equal. We also know that the cardinality of formula_101 cannot be less than the cardinality of formula_100 because formula_101 contains all singletons, by definition, and these singletons form a &quot;copy&quot; of formula_100 inside of formula_101. Therefore, only one possibility remains, and that is that the cardinality of formula_101 is strictly greater than the cardinality of formula_100, proving Cantor&#x27;s theorem.

==Related paradoxes==
Cantor&#x27;s theorem and its proof are closely related to two paradoxes of set theory.

Cantor&#x27;s paradox is the name given to a contradiction following from Cantor&#x27;s theorem together with the assumption that there is a set containing all sets, the universal set formula_145. In order to distinguish this paradox from the next one discussed below, it is important to note what this contradiction is. By Cantor&#x27;s theorem formula_146 for any set formula_9. On the other hand, all elements of formula_148 are sets, and thus contained in formula_145, therefore formula_150.

Another paradox can be derived from the proof of Cantor&#x27;s theorem by instantiating the function &quot;f&quot; with the identity function; this turns Cantor&#x27;s diagonal set into what is sometimes called the &quot;Russell set&quot; of a given set &quot;A&quot;:

:formula_151

The proof of Cantor&#x27;s theorem is straightforwardly adapted to show that assuming a set of all sets &quot;U&quot; exists, then considering its Russell set &quot;R&quot;&quot;U&quot; leads to the contradiction:
:formula_152

This argument is known as Russell&#x27;s paradox. As a point of subtlety, the version of Russell&#x27;s paradox we have presented here is actually a theorem of Zermelo; we can conclude from the contradiction obtained that we must reject the hypothesis that &quot;R&quot;&quot;U&quot;∈&quot;U&quot;, thus disproving the existence of a set containing all sets. This was possible because we have used restricted comprehension (as featured in ZFC) in the definition of &quot;R&quot;&quot;A&quot; above, which in turn entailed that

:formula_153

Had we used unrestricted comprehension (as in Frege&#x27;s system for instance) by defining the Russell set simply as formula_154, then the axiom system itself would have entailed the contradiction, with no further hypotheses needed.

Despite the syntactical similarities between the Russell set (in either variant) and the Cantor diagonal set, Alonzo Church emphasized that Russell&#x27;s paradox is independent of considerations of cardinality and its underlying notions like one-to-one correspondence.

==History==
Cantor gave essentially this proof in a paper published in 1891 &quot;Über eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre&quot;, where the diagonal argument for the uncountability of the reals also first appears (he had earlier proved the uncountability of the reals by other methods). The version of this argument he gave in that paper was phrased in terms of indicator functions on a set rather than subsets of a set. He showed that if &quot;f&quot; is a function defined on &quot;X&quot; whose values are 2-valued functions on &quot;X&quot;, then the 2-valued function &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 − &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) is not in the range of &quot;f&quot;.

Bertrand Russell has a very similar proof in &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot; (1903, section 348), where he shows that there are more propositional functions than objects. &quot;For suppose a correlation of all objects and some propositional functions to have been affected, and let phi-&quot;x&quot; be the correlate of &quot;x&quot;. Then &quot;not-phi-&quot;x&quot;(&quot;x&quot;),&quot; i.e. &quot;phi-&quot;x&quot; does not hold of &quot;x&quot;&quot; is a propositional function not contained in this correlation; for it is true or false of &quot;x&quot; according as phi-&quot;x&quot; is false or true of &quot;x&quot;, and therefore it differs from phi-&quot;x&quot; for every value of &quot;x&quot;.&quot; He attributes the idea behind the proof to Cantor.

Ernst Zermelo has a theorem (which he calls &quot;Cantor&#x27;s Theorem&quot;) that is identical to the form above in the paper that became the foundation of modern set theory (&quot;Untersuchungen über die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre I&quot;), published in 1908. See Zermelo set theory.

==Generalizations==
Lawvere&#x27;s fixed-point theorem provides for a broad generalization of Cantor&#x27;s theorem to any category with finite products in the following way: let formula_155 be such a category, and let formula_156 be a terminal object in formula_155. Suppose that formula_10 is an object in formula_155 and that there exists an endomorphism formula_160 that does not have any fixed points; that is, there is no morphism formula_161 that satisfies formula_162. Then there is no object formula_163 of formula_155 such that a morphism formula_165 can parameterize all morphisms formula_166. In other words, for every object formula_163 and every morphism formula_168, an attempt to write maps formula_166 as maps of the form formula_170 must leave out at least one map formula_166.

<text>Breakcore is a style of electronic dance music that emerged from jungle, hardcore, and drum and bass in the mid-to-late 1990s. It is characterized by very complex and intricate breakbeats and a wide palette of sampling sources played at high tempos.

== History ==

As the early days of &quot;hardcore techno&quot; or just &quot;hardcore&quot; began to settle in Europe, breakcore as a genre began to take more concrete forms in other parts of the world. Inspired by new labels such as Addict, from Milwaukee, US; Peace Off from Rennes, France; Sonic Belligeranza from Bologna, Italy; and Planet Mu, from London, it began to take a new shape, adding in more elements of mashup and IDM to the hardcore sounds. Each of these labels began to draw in aspects of their own social and aesthetic scenes, allowing for an even broader definition of what was possible in the music. 

In Europe, the breakcore genre was solidified by raves and club events such as Belgium&#x27;s Breakcore Gives Me Wood, featuring local acts such as UndaCova and Sickboy; Breakcore A Go Go, in the Netherlands, which was run by FFF and Bong-Ra; as well as Anticartel, in Rennes, the seat of PeaceOff, and later, Wasted in Berlin and Bangface in London.

Breakcore has been subject to changing and branching. Many newer breakcore artists (such as Mochipet etc.) focus on melodic progressions and complex drum programming while other artists still focus on distorted hardcore breakbeats and dark-edged musical influences (such as heavy metal and industrial). The artist Venetian Snares has produced breakcore blended with elements of classical music. Other artists such as Shitmat, Sickboy, DJ Scotch Egg, and Drop the Lime take another direction towards mash-up, happy hardcore, and rave to make a lighter, more humorous sound. The rise of Chiptune music has also blended with breakcore with artists such as Tarmvred. The UK free party scene has also expressed a large interest in producing and distributing its own takes on breakcore, with crews and labels such as Life4land, Hekate, Headfuk, and Bad Sekta helping to push the scene and sound forward, as well as bringing over a number of international artists to play at their parties and club nights. Breakcore is steadily gaining in popularity, and aspiring artists are found scattered across the Internet.

Sociologist Andrew Whelan notes that Venetian Snares has become &quot;synonymous with breakcore such that alternative styles are being sidelined.&quot; He adds that breakcore is the best example of a music genre whose development is intrinsically linked to online and peer-to-peer distribution.

=== 2020s revival ===
In the 2020s breakcore underwent a revival, bringing with it a noticeably different sound than the music produced in the 1990s and 2000s. According to &quot;Bandcamp Daily&quot; writer James Gui, 2020s breakcore is nostalgic, atmospheric, and sentimental, and grew out of the digital hardcore scene of the 2010s. It is accompanied by an aesthetic that draws from video games, anime, and internet culture with artists such as Machine Girl and Goreshit being influential to the revival&#x27;s aesthetic and sound.

== Characteristics ==
The most defining characteristic of breakcore is the drum work, which is often based on the manipulation of the Amen break and other classic jungle and hip-hop breaks at high BPM. The techniques applied to achieve this differ from musician to musician, some preferring to cut up and rearrange the breaks, while others merely distort and loop breaks or apply various effects such as delay and chorus to alter the break&#x27;s timbre.

Melodically, there is nothing that defines breakcore. Classic rave sounds such as acid bass lines, Hoovers and Reese bass are common, but breakcore is mostly known for sampling sounds from all over the musical spectrum to accommodate the frantic and fast-paced nature of the rhythm section. Around the turn of the century, more and more breakcore musicians began employing traditional synthesis techniques to compose elaborate melodies and harmonies. There are a growing number of musicians who make use of recorded live instrumentation in their music, such as Istari Lasterfahrer, Hecate, Benn Jordan, Ruby My Dear, Qüatros, Venetian Snares, Drumcorps, and Igorrr.

According to Simon Reynolds of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;purveyed by artists like DJ/Rupture and Teamshadetek, the [breakcore] music combines rumbling bass lines, fidgety beats and grainy ragga vocals to create a home-listening surrogate for the &#x27;&#x27; vibe of a Jamaican sound system party. Others within the breakcore genre, like Knifehandchop, Kid606 and Soundmurderer, hark back to rave&#x27;s own early days, their music evoking the rowdy fervor of a time when huge crowds flailed their limbs to a barrage of abstract noise and convulsive rhythm. It&#x27;s a poignant aural mirage of a time when techno music was made for the popular vanguard rather than a connoisseurial elite, as it is today.&quot;

=== Raggacore ===
Raggacore is a style of music derived from ragga jungle that somewhat predates breakcore, characterized by ragga and dancehall rhythms and vocals. Its roots can arguably be traced back to jungle producer Remarc, who was one of the first producers to mix ragga and dancehall vocals with chaotic and intricately rearranged break beats. While only a few producers primarily work in the style, it still has a sizable following among breakcore fans. Notable releases in this style include those by Aaron Spectre and Bong-Ra.

=== Mashcore ===
The term &quot;mashcore&quot; was coined by English breakcore artist Shitmat to describe his music such as his track &quot;There’s No Business Like Propa’ Rungleclotted Mashup Bizznizz&quot;. Mashcore primarily draws from the mashup genre of music and shows an irreverence towards the idea that free or pirated music is worthless.

==== Reizokore ====
Reizokore is a more hyper, &quot;ADHD&quot;, style of mashcore pioneered by Ukrainian artist Reizoko Cj.

==== Dancecore ====
Dancecore is a subgenre of mashcore that is more dancefloor influenced, making use of &quot;four on the floor&quot; rhythms and gabber kicks, and sampling mainly from Eurobeat, &#x27;90s techno, and other dance music genres.

=== Amenpunk ===
Aaron Spectre is regarded to have made the first &quot;amenpunk&quot; E.P. under his Drumcorps alias. The style originated around 2006, and is characterized by sampling of pop-punk and other upbeat styles of punk music.

== Influences ==
In London, DJ Scud co-founded Ambush Records in 1997 with fellow producer Aphasic to focus on more extreme noise-oriented hardcore drum and bass. Some artists released on Ambush are Christoph Fringeli, Slepcy, The Panacea, and Noize Creator. &quot;Scud and Nomex tracks like &#x27;Total Destruction&#x27; helped create the blueprint for much of breakcore&#x27;s sound, a high-bpm mash-up of hyperkinetic, post-jungle breaks, feedback, noise, and Jamaican elements paired with a devil-may-care attitude towards sampling that pulls from the broadest musical spectrum of styles (hip-hop, rock, industrial, pop, and beyond).&quot;

At the same time, Bloody Fist Records based in Newcastle, Australia, released many records of hardcore/gabber, industrial, and noise. Artists signed to Bloody Fist in its lifetime include Syndicate, Xylocaine, Epsilon and Nasenbluten. Label founder Mark Newlands said, in 1997, &quot;I think that the uncomfortableness also comes from a reaction towards the mainstream and popular culture that&#x27;s constantly shoved down our throats, that&#x27;s forced on the people via television, radio, mass media, etc. I think that also fuels the fire and keeps the aggressiveness there and the uncomfortableness.&quot; Newlands described their music as products of &quot;cut&#x27;n&#x27;paste mentality&quot; and an industrial environment. In her &quot;Experimental Music&quot;, Gail Priest credits the label as recognized globally for its contributions to the breakcore genre, and for spurring its 1990s development. The Bloody Fist sound became breakcore from what was the noise genre, with added elements of high beats per minute and &quot;extreme&quot;, thick, low-fi textures&quot;. By way of example, Nasenbluten&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Fuck Anna Wood&quot; exemplified this style with controversial public affairs audio samples collaged into dialogue atop early hardcore beats.

Formed in 1994, Digital Hardcore Recordings released music by artists such as Alec Empire, Shizuo, Atari Teenage Riot, EC8OR, and Bomb20, shaping the breakcore sound. This label is also responsible for digital hardcore, a genre developed simultaneously to breakcore. The Alec Empire album &quot;The Destroyer&quot; is often noted as the first breakcore album.

English producer Shoebill has noted that autism, and especially its interaction with gender identity, has influenced &quot;almost everyone&quot; they know in the breakcore scene.

== Reception ==
&quot;Vice&quot; magazine compared the genre to the types of music used during Guantanamo Bay interrogations, and has also stated that reizokore sounds like &quot;a new genre of dubstep made with chainsaws and Ritalin&quot;.

<text>The Barlas (; Chagatay/ &quot;Barlās&quot;; also &quot;Berlās&quot;) were a Mongol and later Turkicized nomadic confederation in Central Asia. With military roots in one of the regiments of the Mongol army, the Barlas spawned two major imperial dynasties in Asia: the Timurid Empire in Central Asia and Persia; and its later branch, the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent.

== Origins ==
According to the &quot;Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, written during the reign of Ögedei Khan [&quot;r.&quot; 1229–1241], the Barlas shared ancestry with the Borjigin, the imperial clan of Genghis Khan and his successors, and other Mongol clans. The leading clan of the Barlas traced its origin to Qarachar Barlas, head of one of Chagatai&#x27;s regiments. Qarachar Barlas was a descendant of the legendary Mongol warlord &quot;Bodonchir&quot; (&quot;Bodon Achir&quot;; &quot;Bodon&#x27;ar Mungqaq&quot;), who was also considered a direct ancestor of Genghis Khan. The internal structure of the Barlas&#x27; leading clan consisted of five major lineages– tracing back to the sons of Qarachar– who were important in matters of inheritance but did not constitute separate political or territorial entities.

The Barlas controlled the region of Kish (modern Shahrisabz, Uzbekistan) and all of its lineages seem to have been associated with this region. In contrast to most neighboring tribes who remained nomadic, the Barlas were a sedentary tribe. Due to extensive contacts with the native population of Central Asia, the tribe had adopted the religion of Islam, and the Chagatai language, a Turkic language of the Qarluq branch, which was heavily influenced by Arabic and Persian. Although the Barlas were not always exogamous, most marriages recorded were outside the tribe.

== Timurids and Mughals ==

Its most famous representatives were the Timurids, a dynasty founded by the conqueror Timur in the 14th century, who ruled over modern-day Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and almost the entire rest of the Caucasus, Afghanistan, much of Central Asia, as well as parts of contemporary Pakistan, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia. One of his descendants, Babur, later founded the Mughal Empire of Central Asia and South Asia.

<doc id="341448" wikidata="Q144949" url="?curid=341448" title="Asimov's Science Fiction">
<text>Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction is an American science fiction magazine edited by Sheila Williams and published by Dell Magazines, which is owned by Penny Press. It was launched as a quarterly by Davis Publications in 1977, after obtaining Isaac Asimov&#x27;s consent for the use of his name. It was originally titled Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine, and was quickly successful, reaching a circulation of over 100,000 within a year, and switching to monthly publication within a couple of years. George H. Scithers, the first editor, published many new writers who went on to be successful in the genre. Scithers favored traditional stories without sex or obscenity; along with frequent humorous stories, this gave &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; a reputation for printing juvenile fiction, despite its success. Asimov was not part of the editorial team, but wrote editorials for the magazine.

Scithers was fired in 1982, and his replacement, Kathleen Moloney, only lasted a year. Shawna McCarthy took over as editor in 1983, and quickly relaxed the strictures on the kind of fiction &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; was willing to publish. &quot;Her Furry Face&quot;, by Leigh Kennedy, with a plot that involved sex with an intelligent orangutan, scandalized some readers, as did other stories involving sex or violence. Asimov defended McCarthy&#x27;s choices in an editorial, and &quot;Her Furry Face&quot; was nominated for a Nebula Award. McCarthy transformed the magazine into a leading market for science fiction writers, and more award-winning stories appeared, including fiction by Frederik Pohl, Robert Silverberg, Lucius Shepard, and John Varley.

Gardner Dozois took over as editor in 1985 and stayed for nearly twenty years. &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; continued to be a prestigious market and several award-winning stories appeared during Dozois&#x27;s tenure, including Lucius Shepard&#x27;s &quot;R&amp;R&quot;; Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Hatrack River&quot;; Pat Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Rachel in Love&quot;; Suzy McKee Charnas&#x27;s &quot;Boobs&quot;; and Terry Bisson&#x27;s &quot;Bears Discover Fire&quot;. Mike Ashley, a historian of science fiction magazines, describes Dozois&#x27;s time at &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest of all editorial careers&quot;. Dozois was succeeded by Sheila Williams in 2004.

Davis sold the magazine to Dell Magazines in 1992, and Dell was acquired by Penny Press in 1996. &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; switched to bimonthly publication in 2017. Circulation declined steadily over the life of the magazine and as of 2020 it was below 20,000, more than half of that coming from online subscriptions.

== Publication history ==
In February 1976, Isaac Asimov visited the offices of Davis Publications in New York to drop off a story he was submitting to &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. Joel Davis, the publisher, had recently acquired &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, and was interested in adding new fiction magazines to his list. One of his employees had gone to a Star Trek convention with their children, and had told Davis how much the children had enjoyed it. This prompted Davis to talk to Asimov about a new science fiction magazine, and Davis asked Asimov if he could use his name as part of the magazine&#x27;s title. Asimov was concerned about the potential impact on two of the major science fiction magazines of the day, &quot;Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact&quot;, and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; (&quot;F&amp;SF&quot;), both of which were edited by friends of his, Ben Bova and Ed Ferman. Davis argued that a new magazine would be good for the field, and Bova and Ferman both told Asimov that they agreed with Davis. Asimov agreed to go ahead with the plan on condition that he did not act as editor. Asimov wrote a regular science column for &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, which he continued, but Davis asked him not to submit fiction to competing magazines.
George Scithers was soon hired to fill the editorial role, with Gardner Dozois as associate editor; Dozois only stayed a year, as he and Scithers did not agree on what kind of stories should be accepted. Davis initially committed to three quarterly issues, the first of which was dated Spring 1977, and appeared on December 16, 1976. The magazine was immediately successful, circulation reaching 108,843 for the first year, a little higher than &quot;Analog&quot;&#x27;s. Circulation was helped by the distribution network that Davis Publications already had access to for its existing magazines, with robust newsstand distribution. Paperback anthologies of stories from the magazine were assembled, starting at the end of 1977; these were profitable and also attracted new readers. The magazine&#x27;s success persuaded Davis to move to a bimonthly schedule for 1978, and to monthly starting with the January 1979 issue. Davis decided to launch a second magazine, &quot;Asimov&#x27;s SF Adventure Magazine&quot;, targeted to a younger audience. The first issue was dated Fall 1978. Four quarterly issues appeared, but sales were weak, and a planned fifth issue never appeared.
Davis moved all four of his fiction magazines to a four-weekly schedule in 1981, meaning there were thirteen issues per year. The change took effect at &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; with the January issue, which was dated January 19, 1981. This led to newsstand vendors removing the magazine more quickly, since the date implied that it was a weekly magazine. The cover date was changed back to the current month starting with the April 1982 issue, but the new schedule remained in place, with &quot;Mid-December&quot; issues for more than a decade thereafter.

Davis launched two more magazines in 1981: &quot;Crime Digest&quot; and &quot;Science Fiction Digest&quot;; these carried book excerpts and publishing news. Scithers had been announced as the editor of &quot;Science Fiction Digest&quot;, but when it was launched Shawna McCarthy was given the editorial role. This may have been because Scithers was based in Philadelphia, with a local team of first readers to help read the incoming manuscripts, and Davis wanted an editor who was in the New York office five days a week. According to Asimov, Scithers and Davis never got along very well. Scithers&#x27;s refusal to move to New York made matters worse, and there were other sources of tension: Davis appointed Carol Gross as executive director in charge of marketing and production, and Gross instigated a redesign of the magazine and took control of the art department away from Scithers. In December 1981, Scithers was fired.

Scithers&#x27;s replacement was Kathleen Moloney, who was hired away from Bantam where she had been a book editor. At first Moloney edited the stories heavily without consulting the authors until the galley proofs were printed, against McCarthy&#x27;s advice. After pushback from the authors, Moloney turned over manuscript editing to McCarthy. Moloney was hired away by Times Books later that year, and replaced by McCarthy, who was told that Asimov had insisted that she become the next editor if the magazine wanted to keep his name. Her first issue was dated January 1983. She was succeeded in May 1985 by Gardner Dozois, though he was not credited on the masthead until January 1986.
Circulation had declined from its first-year peak to about 80,000 by the time Dozois became editor. The 1987 recession caused Davis Publications financial problems, and Davis decided to sell all four fiction magazines. While he searched for a buyer, changes were made to increase profitability: two issues per year were doubled in size and increased in price. The magazines were bought in January 1992 by Bantam-Doubleday-Dell, and became part of Dell Magazines. The title was shortened that November to &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;.

In September 1996 Dell Magazines was sold to Penny Press. The schedule returned to monthly and the October and November issues were combined, so that only eleven rather than thirteen issues appeared per year. The page count was cut, and prices increased. In June 1998 the size was increased from a standard digest size of to to match other Penny Press magazines, which made printing and binding more efficient. The page count dropped at the same time, but the changes were announced as an increase in total text of 10%, with no change in price. However, a year later the price rose again. Circulation dropped over 30% over the first four years of Penny Press&#x27;s ownership, from about 46,000 to under 32,000, probably partly because of these changes. Most of the decline was in subscription sales, though profitability was helped by subscribers who came through the magazine&#x27;s website, which had been started in 1998, instead of through a third party that took a commission from the subscription price.

Dozois gave up the editorship in 2004, and was succeeded by Sheila Williams, whose first issue was dated December of that year. The number of issues per year was reduced to ten starting in 2004, with the April and May issues combined into a double-sized issue. In 2008 the size was increased again, to , to make the magazine more prominent on newsstands. From January 2017, the schedule was changed to six bimonthly double-sized issues per year.

In February 2025, the magazine was purchased by a group of investors led by Steven Salpeter, president of literary and IP development at Assemble Media.

== Contents and reception ==

=== Scithers (1977–1982) ===

Asimov and Scithers agreed at the launch of the magazine on their goals for the magazine. In an editorial in the first issue, Asimov said &quot;we will lean toward hard science fiction, and toward the reasonably straightforward in the way of style... We will have humorous stories and we will have an occasional unclassifiable story&quot;. Mike Ashley, a historian of science fiction, summarizes the plans for the magazine: &quot;It was not to be one full of stories trying to put the world to rights, nor to be full of experimental or New Wave material.&quot;

The first issue included stories by Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Jonathan Fast, and Fred Saberhagen, and an excerpt from Gordon R. Dickson&#x27;s novel &quot;Time Storm&quot; which would be published later that year. John Varley contributed two stories: &quot;Good-Bye, Robinson Crusoe&quot;, one of his Eight Worlds stories; and (under a pseudonym) &quot;Air Raid&quot;, which was turned into a film, &quot;Millennium&quot;, in 1989. &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; soon became known for humorous stories. The only touch of humor in the first issue was Clarke&#x27;s story, &quot;Quarantine&quot;, which was a very short story originally written to fit on a postcard, but more quickly appeared. Two stories by Asimov based on puns appeared in the second issue, and the third issue saw the re-appearance of Reginald Bretnor&#x27;s &quot;Feghoot&quot; series of punning stories that had appeared in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Venture Science Fiction&quot; decades earlier. More &quot;spoofs or parodies and occasional limericks&quot; appeared which &quot;threatened to overshadow the more serious fiction&quot;, according to science fiction historian Mike Ashley. For example &quot;Bat Durston: Space Marshal&quot; by G. Richard Bozarth was a parody, inspired by an advertisement that had appeared on the back cover of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in the 1950s; Ashley points out that new readers might have thought it was intended as a serious story. Allied with some stories clearly written for younger readers, these stories gave the impression that the magazine was not aimed at an adult audience. Orson Scott Card commented in an early review of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; that it had &quot;tapped a juvenile market that none of the other magazines was reaching&quot;, and other reviewers made similar comments. As a result, some writers did not submit manuscripts to &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; despite the competitive rates of pay. Ashley suggests that when Dozois left the editorial staff after only a year, it was because he wanted to acquire stories that were more sophisticated than the material Scithers preferred.

Scithers bought the first published stories of many writers over his tenure, and his habit of announcing in the magazine when a story was a first sale may have encouraged more submissions from new writers. His discoveries included Barry Longyear and Diana Paxson, and several more authors who had only just started their careers began selling regularly to Scithers, including John M. Ford, Nancy Kress, and Somtow Sucharitkul. Longyear&#x27;s &quot;Circus World&quot; series began in the magazine, but his best-received story was &quot;Enemy Mine&quot;, which appeared in the September 1979 issue and won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards. Some well-established writers appeared in the magazine, despite its reputation as a juvenile market: Varley contributed &quot;The Barbie Murders&quot; in early 1978, and Michael Bishop, Brian Aldiss, Tanith Lee, Robert Silverberg, Gene Wolfe, and James Tiptree, Jr, all appeared during Scither&#x27;s tenure. Scithers won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor in 1978, the first year in which he was eligible, and again in 1980.

&quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; readership included many who were new to the field, and many more who had given up on the other major science fiction magazines. This combination was a good fit for Scithers&#x27;s approach: traditional stories, without sex or profanity: &quot;nothing too challenging or revolutionary&quot;, in Ashley&#x27;s words. Some veteran science fiction writers such as L. Sprague de Camp, Hal Clement, and Jack Williamson fit in well with Scithers&#x27;s constraints, producing material that could have been printed in a 1950s magazine, but Frederik Pohl&#x27;s &quot;Like unto the Locust&quot;, which appeared in 1979, did not. Letters poured in objecting to the profanity that appeared in the story. Scithers responded: &quot;... we want to apologize for not copy-editing this installment as well as we should. It&#x27;s not our intention to use language quite that strong when we (and the authors) can avoid doing so.&quot; Evidence from circulation figures suggest that longtime readers of science fiction were becoming a smaller percentage of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; readership, and Ashley describes the result as stagnation: Scithers&#x27;s had &quot;dumbed down&quot; the material to please the new readers &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; was attracting, but as a result the magazine was becoming isolated within the field. John Shirley criticized the magazine in 1979 as &quot;a fog of predictability, formula, and done-to-death techno-bullshit imagery&quot;, adding a year later that Scithers was playing it safe, &quot;And when you&#x27;re &quot;that&quot; safe, you&#x27;re schlock... People think that this is science fiction and I fear that it is a major neutralizing influence on the field.&quot; Ashley argues that the magazine&#x27;s success cannot be ascribed only to the unchallenging fiction it printed; Asimov&#x27;s name drew in many fans of his books, and Davis Publications&#x27; marketing experience helped as well.

Although Asimov had no editorial role, he was named the magazine&#x27;s editorial director and wrote many editorials for it. A puzzle column by Martin Gardner began in the first issue. A book review column, by Charles N. Brown, followed in the second issue; Brown was replaced by Baird Searles in May 1979.

=== Moloney (1982) ===
Moloney had no background in science fiction, but soon realized that Asimov&#x27;s name was a significant asset. She persuaded Asimov to submit his Azazel stories, which he had begun publishing in the competing magazines, to &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot;, starting with &quot;To the Victor&quot; in July 1982. Moloney added two non-fiction columns: a profile of a writer, often written by Charles Platt, and an opinion column called Viewpoint. A cartoon series, &quot;Mooney&#x27;s Module&quot;, began, and she commissioned crosswords from Merl Reagle. Reader reaction was mixed, some letters complaining about the non-fiction columns taking up space that could have been used for another story. Moloney&#x27;s impact on the fiction was limited; negative author reaction to her habit of heavily editing their manuscripts, and advice from McCarthy, led to her giving McCarthy a good deal of control over the fiction. Two well-known stories published during Moloney&#x27;s tenure were Connie Willis&#x27;s &quot;A Letter from the Clearys&quot;, and David Brin&#x27;s &quot;The Postman&quot;, which later formed the basis of a novel and film of the same name.

=== McCarthy (1983–1985) ===
McCarthy took over fully as editor with Moloney&#x27;s departure at the end of 1982. The February 1983 issue, the second one with McCarthy&#x27;s name on the masthead, included Greg Bear&#x27;s novella &quot;Hardfought&quot;, which went on to win the Nebula Award. McCarthy was willing to expand the range of fiction the magazine published, and most readers who wrote in agreed that the prohibition on sex and violence could be relaxed, but Davis Publications did not want to risk alienating the young readers whom they knew formed part of the magazine&#x27;s audience. McCarthy was unable to resolve this conflict for Connie Willis&#x27;s &quot;All My Darling Daughters&quot;, a story featuring &quot;lesbianism and bestiality and incest&quot;, in Willis&#x27;s words, and it never saw print in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot;, appearing in Willis&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Fire Watch&quot; instead. McCarthy continued to be open to a broader range of fiction than Scithers had been, and at the end of the year published Leigh Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Her Furry Face&quot;, with a plot that involved sex with an intelligent orangutan. Two stories in the next issue featuring street violence: Norman Spinrad&#x27;s &quot;Street Meat&quot;, and Octavia Butler&#x27;s &quot;Speech Sounds&quot;. McCarthy introduced &quot;Street Meat&quot; by saying &quot;What follows is not for the faint of heart.&quot; Kennedy&#x27;s story led to many complaints and canceled subscriptions, and McCarthy was asked by Davis to be cautious in future, but the stories were well received: &quot;Speech Sounds&quot; won that year&#x27;s short story Hugo Award and &quot;Her Furry Face&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award. Asimov defended the publication of &quot;Her Furry Face&quot; in a subsequent editorial. McCarthy commented afterwards that &quot;the long-time Asimov fans were shocked and we hadn&#x27;t gotten enough new readers yet&quot;. Other stories from McCarthy&#x27;s first year in charge included Dozois&#x27;s &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;, in the August 1983 issue, which won the Nebula Award.

Well-received stories from 1984, McCarthy&#x27;s second year in charge, included Lucius Shepard&#x27;s &quot;A Traveler&#x27;s Tale&quot;, John Kessel&#x27;s &quot;The Big Dream&quot;, and Varley&#x27;s &quot;Press Enter■&quot;, which won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards. Ashley singles out Octavia Butler&#x27;s &quot;Bloodchild&quot;, in the June 1984 issue, as &quot;arguably the single most important story publiished during McCarthy&#x27;s editorship&quot;. The story was about a race of insectoid aliens. The human protagonist has a relationship with one of the aliens, and agrees to allow the alien to lay their eggs in his body. &quot;Bloodchild&quot; won the Hugo and Nebula Awards and appeared in all that year&#x27;s &quot;Best of Science Fiction&quot; anthologies. Reader reaction in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; was positive, and a 1995 review of Butler&#x27;s collection &quot;Bloodchild and Other Stories&quot; described the story as &quot;one of the genre&#x27;s undisputed classics&quot;.

McCarthy&#x27;s effect on the magazine was quickly noticed. Dozois&#x27;s summary of 1983 in science fiction commented that &quot;If there was an award for the most dramatically improved magazine of the year, it would have to go to &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;, and the credit for that sea change seems to belong almost entirely to new editor Shawna McCarthy.&quot; Writers began to make &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; their first market to submit to, and 1985 saw more award-winning stories as a result: Pohl&#x27;s &quot;Fermi and Frost&quot;; Silverberg&#x27;s &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot;; Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;24 Views of Mount Fuji, by Hokusai&quot;; and &quot;Portraits of His Children&quot;, by George R. R. Martin. For the three years that McCarthy edited, &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; dominated the annual science fiction awards, accounting for almost a third of the nominations for Hugo, Nebula, and Locus Awards, and inclusions in the annual &quot;Year&#x27;s Best&quot; anthologies.

McCarthy discovered or encouraged many new writers, including Mary Gentle, Nina Kiriki Hoffman, Paul J. McAuley, and Karen Joy Fowler. She won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor in 1984.

=== Dozois (1986–2004) ===

When Dozois took over the editorship of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot;, McCarthy&#x27;s work had changed the image of the magazine, and Dozois worked to solidify the impression that, in Ashley&#x27;s words, &quot;&quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; was where the &#x27;cutting edge&#x27; work in the field was appearing, so that authors would be eager to appear there&quot;. Dozois&#x27;s tenure began as cyberpunk (a subgenre of science fiction focused on the consequences of virtual reality and computer technology) was becoming more popular, and cyberpunk fiction soon appeared: in January 1986, Dozois serialized William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Count Zero&quot;, the sequel to Gibson&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, and he also printed Pat Cadigan&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Boy Crossover&quot;. &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; did not focus solely on cyberpunk, though; Dozois printed a wide variety of speculative fiction. Stories from Dozois&#x27;s first year include Lucius Shepard&#x27;s &quot;R&amp;R&quot;, which won the Nebula; Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Hatrack River&quot;, which won the World Fantasy Award; and Kate Wilhelm&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Who Fell From the Sky&quot;, which won a Nebula. Pat Murphy and Kim Stanley Robinson began selling regularly to Dozois; Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Rachel in Love&quot;, in the April 1987 issue, about a teenage girl&#x27;s personality in a chimpanzee&#x27;s body, won a Nebula and a Locus Award, and Robinson&#x27;s &quot;The Blind Geometer&quot;, in the August issue, also won a Nebula.

&quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; had never run serials before &quot;Count Zero&quot;, and there was some resistance from the readers, since in most cases the novel would also be published in book form. Dozois persisted for a while, with Michael Swanwick&#x27;s &quot;Vacuum Flowers&quot; beginning serialization in the Mid-December 1986 issue. Harlan Ellison&#x27;s script for a film based on Asimov&#x27;s robot short stories was serialized at the end of 1987 as &quot;I Robot: The Movie&quot;, and Swanwick&#x27;s &quot;Stations of the Tide&quot; ran in the Mid-December 1990 and January 1991 issues, but those were the last to appear.

A regular feature of the magazine was a long novella as the lead story. Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Eye for Eye&quot;, which won a Hugo, appeared in this slot, as did Megan Lindholm&#x27;s &quot;A Touch of Lavender&quot;, voted the most popular novella of 1989 by &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; readers. Dozois also published shorter fiction: short stories from Dozoi&#x27;s tenure at &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; that won the Hugo or Nebula awards include Suzy McKee Charnas&#x27;s &quot;Boobs&quot; (1989), Terry Bisson&#x27;s &quot;Bears Discover Fire&quot; (1990), and Michael Swanwick&#x27;s &quot;The Very Pulse of the Machine&quot;. Newer writers discovered by Dozois included Allen Steele and Mary Rosenblum, but overall the number of new writers appearing in the magazine fell. Ashley suggests this was because the magazine&#x27;s reputation was now high, and Dozois received hundreds of manuscripts a week, making it harder for new authors to break through.

In 2004, &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; was included in a list of magazines available for school fundraising drives. The mother of a 13-year-old girl who bought a copy complained about the magazine, which contained strong language and other material she objected to, and the complaint led to some negative news coverage, described by the &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; as &quot;over-sensationalized&quot;.

Paul DiFilippo and Peter Heck took over the book reviews from Baird Searles in 1994, and Spinrad began contributing critical essays. A column on role-playing games, by Matthew Costello, began in 1996 and lasted for four years. James Patrick Kelly and Robert Silverberg both began contributing columns during Dozois&#x27;s tenure; Kelly&#x27;s column, &quot;On the Net&quot;, began in 1998, and Silverberg&#x27;s &quot;Reflections&quot; started in the July 1994 issue. Silverberg&#x27;s column had originally begun in &quot;Galileo&quot;, in 1978, and had moved to &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; from 1981 to 1994. It is still running in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; as of 2023.

Dozois&#x27;s editorship was well regarded in the field. Dozois won the Hugo Award for best professional editor every year from 1988 to 2004 with only two exceptions, in 1994 and 2002, and Ashley describes his time at &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest of all editorial careers&quot;. Dozois made Asimov into &quot;the most important magazine of its generation&quot;, according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, which comments that Dozois&#x27;s success &quot;stimulated the sf field to rebuild and regenerate itself after the identity crises it had gone through in the 1960s and 1970s&quot;. In 2014 Gary Westfahl praised the &quot;creative editors of the 1980s and 1990s, such as Gardner Dozois of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; and Gordon Van Gelder of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;&quot;, but added that &quot;such editors were no longer the most important figures in the field&quot;.

=== Williams (2004 – present) ===
In Williams&#x27; first editorial, in the January 2005 issue, she made it clear she did not plan to make dramatic changes to the approach established by McCarthy and Dozois. Williams reinstated the letter column, and began an intermittent non-fiction column, &quot;Thought Experiments&quot;, starting with a reminiscence by Roger Ebert of his involvement in science fiction fandom. To mark the 30th anniversary of the magazine in 2007, she published a 30th Anniversary Anthology.

She won the Hugo Award for short-form editor in 2011 and 2012.

=== Anthologies ===
A series of five anthologies was issued under the series title &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Choice&quot;, selected from the 1977 and 1978 issues. All were edited by Scithers: the titles were &quot;Astronauts &amp; Androids, Black Holes &amp; Bug-Eyed Monsters, Comets &amp; Computers&quot;, &quot;Dark Stars &amp; Dragons&quot;, and &quot;Extraterrestrial &amp; Eclipses&quot;. Another series, titled &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Anthology&quot;, followed, with volume 1 appearing in 1979, and the eighth and final volume in 1983. An anonymously edited anthology appeared in 1986, titled &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Dozois edited &quot;The Best of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; (1988); &quot;Transcendental Tales from Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; (1989); &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Mars&quot; (1991); and &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s SF Lite&quot; (1993). Dozois and Williams jointly edited &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Robots&quot; (1991) and &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Earth&quot; (1992). Williams edited three short anthologies made available only to subscribers: &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Puzzle&quot; (1984); &quot;Science Fiction by Asimov&quot; (1986); and &quot;Robots From Asimov&#x27;s&quot; (1990).

Martin Gardner&#x27;s puzzles from the first few years of the magazine were collected in three volumes: &quot;Science Fiction Puzzle Tales&quot;, &quot;Puzzles from Other Worlds: Fantastical Brainteasers from Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Riddles of the Sphinx and Other Mathematical Puzzle Tales&quot;. Some of Spinrad&#x27;s critical essays for &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot;, along with a couple of essays from other sources, were collected in &quot;Science Fiction in the Real World&quot; (1990).

=== Overseas editions ===
There have been multiple overseas editions of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot;.

There have been no German magazine versions of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot;, but a series of anthologies from the magazine began in 1978.

<text>ArcelorMittal Dofasco, a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, is a steel company based in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Dofasco is a standalone subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, the world&#x27;s largest integrated steel producer.

==History==
Clifton and Frank A. Sherman founded Dominion Foundries and Steel in 1912, creating a giant that would bring prosperity and identity to the city of Hamilton, Ontario. Dofasco was incorporated as Dominion Steel Castings Company Limited in 1912, becoming Dominion Foundries and Steel Company in 1917. Sherman Mine opened in 1968 and closed in 1990. Its longtime nickname, &quot;Dofasco,&quot; was adopted as its legal name in 1980.

Frank H. Sherman (Frank A.&#x27;s son) introduced to Dofasco and North America in 1954 the method of steel production known as basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), thus rendering former processes obsolete because, with respect to them, the same quantity of steel from a BOS process is manufactured in one-twelfth the time. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used.

Dofasco&#x27;s head office in Hamilton was built in 1964 and was designed by Prack &amp; Prack.

Dofasco owned and operated a number of subsidiaries, including National Steel Car, a Hamilton-based railway freight car manufacturer, from 1962 to 1994, and Algoma Steel, from 1988 to 1991, until union and financial difficulties ultimately forced Dofasco to divest the company.

In 1990, the world economy entered into recession. Dofasco lost $900 million in three years from 1991, in addition to the write-off of $700 million when it sold Algoma. Dofasco was the owner of the Adams and Sherman iron ore mines in Northeastern Ontario until 1990 when Dofasco announced that they would be closing the mines. During the recession of the early 1990s, Dofasco made its first permanent layoffs since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Dofasco has won awards for being the &quot;most sustainable manufacturing company&quot; in North America.

===Acquisition===

In January 2006, Luxembourg-based Arcelor, then the world&#x27;s second-largest steel producer by volume, outbid rival German steel producer, ThyssenKrupp AG, to purchase Dofasco. Analysts cited the strengths of Dofasco, including its non-unionized workforce, strong automotive customer base, unique thin, high-strength steel product, and ownership of a Canadian ore mine.

Dofasco&#x27;s Canadian management initially didn&#x27;t want to be taken over. After Arcelor initially presented a hostile bid of $56 per share, ThyssenKrupp and Dofasco signalled their intentions to enter into a friendly merger. Under that plan, Dofasco would have retained its employee profit-sharing plan and placed in charge of all of ThyssenKrupp&#x27;s North American operations. Arcelor raised its offer significantly, causing ThyssenKrupp to pull out, as further bidding would have downgraded its credit rating. Dofasco paid ThyssenKrupp a breakup fee of $215 million. Dofasco&#x27;s board recommended the latest Arcelor offer of $71 per share in cash, worth an estimated $5.5 billion. While the breakup fee was criticized by some as excessive, most analysts otherwise praised President and CEO Donald A. Pether and the board of directors for their successful handling of the bidding situation.

Arcelor was itself three months later taken over by the world&#x27;s largest steel producer, Mittal. However, in an effort to prevent Dofasco from falling into ThyssenKrupp&#x27;s hands, Arcelor management locked Dofasco into an independent trust based in the Netherlands. Dofasco is now part of the combined ArcelorMittal and has been integrated into their international operations.

==Labour relations==
Unlike rival Stelco, Dofasco is not unionized. As a result, Dofasco has avoided many of the strikes and work stoppages which have plagued its cross-town rival. Some investors complained that the profits should have been distributed to shareholders as a special dividend rather than giving workers larger bonuses, which was a factor in the underperforming stock price despite strong results. As of January 1, 2013, Dofasco (now a standalone subsidiary) reduced the benefits for both drug and dental and changed to a defined contribution pension plan for many of its employees.

While several unsuccessful attempts have been made to organize by the United Steelworkers of America, union negotiations at Stelco may have influenced wages and benefits at Dofasco.

In 2007, Dofasco was named one of Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean&#x27;s magazine, the only steelmaker to receive this honour. The most recent win came in 2020.

Since 1937, Dofasco has annually held a large Christmas party, typically featuring 30,000 guests and a 30-foot (9 m) tree. During the early years, the party was held in one of the large mill buildings on Gage Ave. From 1993 to 2009, the party was held at Copps Coliseum. In 2010, the company moved the party to the company-owned recreation park.

==Pollution==

Steelmaking in Canada has long been associated with pollution. For example, in 1989, Dofasco and Stelco were listed among the &quot;dirty dozen&quot; polluters in Ontario:

In 2014, the company pleaded guilty to violating air quality standards in 2012 and paid violation and victim surcharge fines of approximately half a million dollars. In 2015, there was an accidental release of a large plume of iron oxide dust at the plant due to an instrument failure and Dofasco has been working to address air pollution

==Company slogan==

Since 1970, the company has used the same corporate slogan—&quot;Our product is steel. Our strength is people.&quot;—to create what &quot;Marketing Magazine&quot; has called &quot;one of the most clearly defined corporate images in the country.&quot; The slogan was created by Hamilton-based Kelly Advertising, which has been the company&#x27;s advertising agency since 1927. The slogan can also be seen as recognizing the importance of its workforce, as the company says it has a good relationship with its employees. For a short time, the slogan contained a third line: &quot;Our home is Hamilton.&quot;

<doc id="341459" wikidata="Q312894" url="?curid=341459" title="Juhan Parts">
<text>Juhan Parts ((, born 27 August 1966) is an Estonian politician who was Prime Minister of Estonia from 2003 to 2005 and Minister of Economic Affairs and Communications from 2007 to 2014. Juhan Parts is a member of Isamaa party.

==Education==
Born in Tallinn, Juhan Parts completed Gustav Adolf Grammar School in Tallinn (then &quot;Tallinn Secondary School No. 1&quot;). Afterwards, he studied law at the University of Tartu in Tartu, Estonia.

==Early career==
After completing his university education, Parts instantly joined the Ministry of Justice. who wanted to push for reforms. As an ally of Deputy Minister Mihkel Oviir, he was appointed Auditor General in the spring of 1998. He held this office until 2002. From this virtually unimpeachable office, unique in the Estonian Constitution, he frequently criticised the government and became somewhat of a popular figure in Estonian politics.

==Political career==
Parts became the chairman of a new party, called Res Publica, which he was instrumental in starting. It is a largely technocratic party which can be described as an economically liberal party of young administrators. Res Publica now is a member of the right-of-centre European People&#x27;s Party organisation.

===Prime Minister of Estonia, 2003–2005===
In the Riigikogu (Estonian parliament) elections in 2003, Parts surprisingly gained a majority among the right-of-centre parties, and as a result, he was charged to form a new government coalition and became Prime Minister of Estonia. The new government took office on 10 April 2003.

On 24 March 2005, Parts stepped down as prime minister after a vote of no confidence against Minister of Justice Ken-Marti Vaher had passed the &quot;Riigikogu&quot;. Vaher had established a quota system of how many civil servants had to be prosecuted every year (per county), which is seen as reminiscent of Stalinist purges by many Estonians, a measure that Parts had endorsed.

Parts&#x27; term as Prime Minister officially ended on 12 April 2005 when the Riigikogu confirmed his successor Andrus Ansip.

===Minister for Economic Affairs, 2007–2014===
From 2007 until 2014, Parts served as Minister for Economic Affairs and Communications in the government of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip.

Early in his tenure, Parts unveiled a plan to boost Estonia&#x27;s cyber security in response to the 2007 cyberattacks targeting websites of Estonian organizations, including Estonian parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers and broadcasters. Under his leadership, the Estonian government opened talks with SAS Group about the future of Estonian Air and did not rule out taking a majority stake in the carrier. Also during his time in office, Estonia and Finland signed a 2014 agreement on building two new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals on either side of the Gulf of Finland and a pipeline connecting the two countries.

After calling some members of the Lithuanian government &quot;fools&quot; in a 2014 interview with the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; about the joint Rail Baltic infrastructure project, Parts found himself under heavy fire in both countries.

In the 2015 parliamentary election, Parts was re-elected to the parliament with 4,208 individual votes.

==European Court of Auditors, 2017–2022==
In 2016, the Council of the European Union appointed Parts as member of the European Court of Auditors.

Since taking office, Parts has been leading the Court&#x27;s investigations into the performance of the European Anti-Fraud Office (2019), the European Union&#x27;s 2014-2020 development spending in Kenya (2020) and the use of Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance funds in the Western Balkans (2022).

<text>A [[municipality]] (, plural ) is the smallest administrative subdivision of Estonia. Each municipality is a unit of self-government with its representative and executive bodies. The municipalities in Estonia cover the entire territory of the country.

Municipalities in Estonia are of two types: 
*Urban municipalities or towns (, singular )
*Rural municipalities or [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]]es (, singular ).

There is no other status distinction between them.

Municipalities may contain one or several settlements. All but 5 urban municipalities (Haapsalu, Narva-Jõesuu, Paide, Pärnu and Tartu) plus 1 rural municipality (Ruhnu) contain only one settlement. As of 2017, there are no longer any &quot;borough-parishes&quot;, i.e. rural municipalities with only one borough-type settlement. Ruhnu Parish contains only one village and is therefore a &quot;village-parish&quot;.

Some municipalities are divided into districts. The 8 urban districts (, singular ) of Tallinn have limited self-government, while other urban districts are formed for administrative purposes. Some rural districts () have limited self-government, while other types of rural districts do not.

Municipalities range in population from Tallinn with 427,500 inhabitants to Ruhnu with 68. Previously, as over two-thirds of the municipalities had a population of under 3,000, many of them found it advantageous to co-operate in providing services and carrying out administrative functions.

After the administrative reform was completed in October 2017, there are total of 79 municipalities, 15 of which are urban and 64 rural. 51 of the present municipalities were the result of mergers, 28 remain unchanged. After the reform small municipalities with under 5,000 inhabitants have been reduced from a number of 169 to 15. The number of councillors was reduced from 2,026 to 1,019. In 2022, 36 municipalities (45.56%) had falling population numbers. The municipalities are:

==Gallery of Maps==
== Structure of local authorities ==
In each municipality there is a local government as well as a council.

The council () is a representative body elected by the residents of a municipality for a term of three years. The members of the council elect a chairman (), who organises the council&#x27;s work and represents the municipality.

The government () is an executive body formed by the council. It is headed by a mayor ( in towns, in parishes), who is appointed for a four-year term. The mayor cannot be the chairman of the council. Other members of the government are chosen by the mayor with the approval of the council.

<text>The M9 is a major motorway in Scotland. It runs from the outskirts of Edinburgh, bypassing the towns of Linlithgow, Falkirk, Grangemouth and Stirling to end at Dunblane.

== History==
The first section was Polmont and Falkirk Bypass which opened on 28 August 1968 This was followed by the Newbridge Bypass which opened on 25 November 1970, the third section Lathalllan to Muriehall (Linlithgow), which joined the two together opened on 18 December 1972.

In April 2022, work began on a new junction at Winchburgh. Winchburgh Developments contributed £40 million towards the construction cost.

== Route ==

The road is approximately long, and runs in a roughly north-west direction from the M8. It meets the A8 at Newbridge – a traffic blackspot before the junction was grade separated. Its next junction is with the M90, the first part of which used to be a spur of the M9 towards the Forth Road Bridge. This spur ended at the single carriageway A8000 road short of the bridge, but was extended in September 2007 to meet the A90 at Scotstoun.

The road shares space with of the M876 en route to the Kincardine Bridge east of Stenhousemuir, at this point the motorway has 3 lanes in each direction, making it the most northerly stretch of motorway in the UK to be 3 lanes wide. At Stirling it meets the M80 (junction 9 of both motorways), taking over the main route through the Carse of Lecropt to the final roundabout at Dunblane. From there, the A9 runs all the way to Thurso. Moto services are located at the M9/M80 junction, accessed via a roundabout which allows access to all routes.

<text>The M18 is a motorway in Yorkshire, England. It runs from the east of Rotherham to Goole and is approximately long. A section of the road forms part of the unsigned Euroroute E13.

==Route==
The M18 runs in a north-east–south-west direction from junction 32 of the M1 motorway to junction 35 of the M62 motorway. It passes east of Rotherham, south-east of Doncaster and Armthorpe, and west of Thorne. It meets the A1(M) at junction 2 (A1(M) junction 35) — known as the Wadworth Interchange — and the M180 motorway at junction 5. Access to Doncaster is provided from junctions 3 (A6182) and 4 (A630)

The middle half of the M18 is a two-lane dual carriageway, and carries relatively low volumes of traffic. However, the M1 to A1(M) section and M180 to M62 section are much busier, with three lanes in each direction, and there is a small three-lane section northbound between junctions 2 and 3. It passes over the Wadworth Viaduct at junction 2. To the north it then crosses the East Coast Main Line, and until its closure and the dismantling of the pit head gear, a large colliery could be seen to the south at Rossington.

==History==
* Junction 1 to junction 2 opened in 1967
* Junction 5 to junction 6 opened in 1972
* Junction 6 to junction 7 opened in 1975
* Junction 4 to junction 5 opened in 1977
* Junction 2 to junction 4 opened in 1979

The M18 was originally to be part of the M1, but it was decided to route the M1 towards Leeds instead of Doncaster, and the routing of what would have been the M1 east of Sheffield became the M18. 
To provide better access to Doncaster town centre and the new Great Yorkshire Way to Doncaster Sheffield Airport, the section of the M18 between junctions 2 and 3 northbound was upgraded to three lanes, between June 2014 and June 2015.

<doc id="341466" wikidata="Q194000" url="?curid=341466" title="Arnold Rüütel">
<text>Arnold Rüütel (, 10 May 1928 – 31 December 2024) was an Estonian politician. He was the third President of Estonia from 8 October 2001 to 9 October 2006. Rüütel was the second president of the country after the end of the 1944–1991 Soviet occupation, and the restoration of the independent Republic of Estonia on 20 August 1991.

==Biography==
Rüütel was born in the village of Pahavalla in Laimjala Parish, Saaremaa, Estonia on 10 May 1928. His parents were Feodor Rüütel (1900−1965) and Juulia Rüütel (1905−1990). He graduated from the Agricultural College in Jäneda in 1949.

He worked as a senior agronomist in Saaremaa (1949−1950) and then as a teacher at the Tartu School of Agricultural Mechanization (1955−1957). In between those two jobs, he served his term in the Soviet Army. In 1957, he was appointed the director of the experimental farm of the Research Institute of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry, and in 1963 he was appointed director of the Tartu Reference State Farm, remaining in this position until 1969. He graduated from the Estonian Academy of Agriculture in 1964. From 1969 to 1977, Rüütel was rector of the Estonian Academy of Agriculture. He served as the last chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR (thus he was also one of the 15 deputy chairmen of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union) from 8 April 1983 to 29 March 1990.

On 29 March 1990, he was elected Chairman of the Supreme Council (head of parliament), after the first free elections in the then Soviet-occupied Estonia. He served in that position when Estonia restored full independence on 20 August 1991, and continued in office until 6 October 1992. In the independent Estonia, Rüütel was also a member of the Constitutional Assembly from 1991 to 1992, which drafted the new Constitution of the Republic of Estonia. He stood as a candidate in the first presidential election in 1992. In the first round, Rüütel received the best result, 43% of popular vote, but still short of required 50% majority. The second round was held in the parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;), and there Rüütel lost in the presidential elections to Lennart Meri.
In 1991, Rüütel took his Doctorate in agriculture. He served as Chairman of the People&#x27;s Union of Estonia from 1994 to 2000, and was elected as a member of parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;), in 1995, where he acted as vice-chairman until 1997. He ran for president in the 1996 election (this time an indirect election with no popular vote) and lost to Meri once again.

==Presidency==

Rüütel was elected president by an electoral college on 21 September 2001, defeating Toomas Savi in the final round by votes of 186 to 155. Rüütel was inaugurated as President of the Republic on 8 October 2001. Rüütel announced in his election manifesto that his principal aims would be to reduce the negative effects that Estonia&#x27;s speedy economic changes had had on a large number of people, and to seek greater solidarity within the society.

The end of Rüütel&#x27;s term was overshadowed by several controversies. At the Independence Day military parade on 24 February 2005, Rüütel repeatedly congratulated soldiers on &#x27;Victory day&#x27; (Estonian Victory Day is on 23 June), which caused speculation about the then 77-year-old president&#x27;s mental health. In January 2006, Estonian Television reported that Rüütel&#x27;s underage granddaughters had organized a party in the presidential palace and drunk alcohol. Later that year, the newspaper &quot;Eesti Ekspress&quot; published archived documents suggesting that Rüütel as a top functionary of the Estonian SSR was involved in the persecution of scientist Johannes Hint (later sentenced to jail in a show trial) by the KGB. Rüütel himself commented that he had tried to defend Hint.

As Rüütel&#x27;s term was due to end in October 2006, he announced on 7 June 2006 that he would be a candidate for re-election, thus ending speculation as to his candidacy. In late August, the parliament failed to elect a President. The election of Ene Ergma and Toomas Hendrik Ilves by the parliament was blocked by Rüütel&#x27;s supporters, who did not take out ballots. The electoral college met to vote for a president on 23 September. The latest opinion polls (September 2006) had suggested that Rüütel&#x27;s popular support was around 31 per cent (Ilves&#x27; support was 51%); Rüütel was more popular amongst the elderly and the Russian-speaking minority. In the electoral college, Rüütel received 162 votes against 174 for Ilves. Rüütel&#x27;s presidency therefore expired at the end of his term, and Ilves took office on 9 October 2006.

==Later activities==
Rüütel voiced support for Mart Helme of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia in the 2016 Estonian presidential election. Since leaving office, he has continued to meet with his former counterparts, including Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev and Moldovan president Petru Lucinschi.

On 26 June 2024, Rüütel left the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia, with which he had been involved in its various forms for 30 years.

==Personal life and death==
Rüütel was married to Ingrid Rüütel and had two daughters.

In his later years, Rüütel resided in Kadriorg. He died on 31 December 2024, at the age of 96. The government accorded him a state funeral on 11 January 2025. He was buried in Metsakalmistu.

<text>The M20 is a motorway in Kent, England. It follows on from the A20 at Swanley, meeting the M25, and continuing on to Folkestone, providing a link to the Channel Tunnel and the ports at Dover. It is long. Although not signposted in England, this road is part of the European route E15. It is also used as a holding area for goods traffic when traffic across the English Channel is disrupted, such as Operation Stack and Operation Brock.

==Route==
The road starts at its junction with the M25 motorway and A20 road just east of Swanley, then continues south east across the River Darent, north of Farningham through the North Downs, past West Kingsdown and Wrotham to meet the M26. It then strikes east, running north of Addington. When it reaches junction 4 it passes south of New Hythe and runs parallel to the Medway Valley railway line before crossing it close to junction 5. This next section is the Maidstone bypass. The High Speed 1 (HS1) railway line then runs parallel to the motorway as it continues to the north of Bearsted, crosses the Swanley to Ashford (via Maidstone East) line then out into the countryside alongside Leeds Castle. Proceeding south of Lenham and Charing it is crossed by the Ashford and HS1 railway lines before becoming the Ashford bypass. Travelling past Brabourne Lees it is once again joined by HS1 and the East Stour.

Just north of Saltwood it reaches the Channel Tunnel terminal and is crossed by HS1 for the last time. The final section runs along the northern suburbs of Folkestone.

==History==

===Construction===
The M20 was, in common with many United Kingdom motorways, opened in stages:

Junctions 5 to 7 opened in 1960. One end was near the &#x27;Old England&#x27; pub on the A20 at Hollingbourne Corner, junction 8, a temporary terminus until 1992, to the A229. It would be £1.5million for the eastern section , to open by the end of March 1960, built by Costain, designed by Scott Wilson. Work was started at Hollingbourne on Monday 5 May 1958 by Richard Nugent, Baron Nugent of Guildford, this was only five weeks after the M1 had started. It was one of three main motorway projects started in 1958. The section was intended to open on 27 March 1960, but was late. On Wednesday 1 June 1960, was opened at Forstal (A229) by Sir Leslie Doubleday, chairman of Kent County Council. Maidstone already had a bypass the A2011, which largely followed the A20(M) bypass. There was a short section of the A20(M) west of the A229 with a temporary terminus on the A2011.

Junctions 7 to 8 opened in 1961 from the A229 to Coldharbour Lane. It was , to take 15months, planned for October 1960. The contract of £822,928 in March 1959 was given to Sir Robert McAlpine. Piles were constructed by West&#x27;s Piling &amp; Construction, of Harmondsworth. Work was started on Monday 13 April 1959 by Harold Watkinson near Cobtree Manor. The bridge across the Medway cost £200,000. The section opened on 3 December 1960. Coldharbour Lane was widened to , with a roundabout on the A20, with a terminus of the A20(M) north along Coldharbour Lane (junction 5). It was the south of England&#x27;s first motorway.

These sections of the M20 were known as the &#x27;Maidstone Bypass&#x27;. This road was then numbered as the A20(M) as it bypassed the stretch of A20 through Maidstone which was renumbered A2020. This was the first stretch of motorway to open south of London. Plans for a bypass of Maidstone had existed since the 1930s, originally as an all-purpose project, before being upgraded to motorway standard in the 1950s. When the motorway was extended westwards towards London in the 1970s, it was renamed M20 and the A2020 reverted to A20.
*Junctions 3 to 5 in 1971
*Junctions 1 to 2 in 1977. The West Kingsdown to Addington section was . It was constructed by Dowsett, with project manager Keith Haddock. The good weather in 1979 had helped
:This section ended at a temporary junction near West Kingsdown.
*Temporary terminus to junction 3 in 1980 this section of the route was difficult to construct due to its steep descent down the North Downs escarpment.
*Sellindge to junction 13 in 1981 constructed by McAlpines
*Junction 9 to Sellindge in 1981 constructed by Dowsett

The section around Ashford (junctions 9–10) was originally the A20 Ashford Bypass with actual construction having started before World War 2 – although the route itself was not opened until 19 July 1957. The bypass started at Willesborough near the current location of junction 10 and terminated south of the existing junction 9 at the current Drover&#x27;s Roundabout. A section of the old bypass is still visible now named Simone Weil Avenue. The original bridge that brought Canterbury Road over the bypass is still visible as the bridge was not reconstructed when the motorway was constructed. This section of motorway has no hard shoulder indicating the smaller width of the old bypass.

This left the motorway in two sections, with the gap running via the A20 this was referred to locally as &#x27;The Missing Link&#x27;. The level of traffic was not considered necessary to complete the route. Most of the traffic for the Channel ports was using the A2/M2 route. When the Channel Tunnel was ready for construction, it was decided to complete the M20 between junctions 8 and 9 and this opened in 1991. Concurrent to this was the extension to Dover as part of the A20 which opened in 1993. A new junction 11A was also constructed to serve the Channel Tunnel.

===Operation===
Following completion of the junction 8 to 9 section, the M20 was three lanes either side of the original A20(M) section. This was a bottleneck, so it was decided to widen this section of motorway. The road here was increased to a dual three- or four-lane road with two-lane distributor roads either side. This section was opened in 1995.

To the north of Maidstone, there is an overlap between the slip roads for junctions 5 (A20) and 6 (A229).

Between 2006 and 2007, junction 10 near Ashford was remodelled to increase capacity when the bridges across the motorway were modified to provide three lanes of traffic at the roundabout, and local approach roads were widened, with new traffic lights to control traffic flows at the junction between the A292 Hythe Road and the London-bound M20 entry slip road. A new footbridge was also constructed across the motorway. The cost was £4.9 million.

A Controlled motorway scheme was introduced in West Kent between junctions 4 and 7, with variable speed limits.

In August 2016, part of a pedestrian footbridge connecting areas of Ryarsh divided by the motorway was brought down initially suspected to be the result of an impact by a digger from nearby works to widen the southbound bridge at junction 4 being carried on a low-loader that was moving along the hard shoulder. In the incident, the southern section of the bridge which rested on a plinth south of the motorway and the cantilevered northern section was dislodged and fell onto the carriageway below, landing on the trailer of a passing HGV and being narrowly avoided by a motorcyclist who suffered broken ribs taking avoiding action. Both carriageways of the motorway were closed to enable the removal of the broken section. The motorway reopened with the Highways Agency having declared that the northern part of the bridge was structurally intact. However this section of the motorway was again closed on the weekend of 3 and 4 September 2016 for the demolition and clearance of the northern bridge element. A replacement pedestrian and cycle bridge was opened in March 2021 at a cost of around £1.5 million.

The Highways Agency proposed a new M20 junction 10a and link road to the A2070 at Ashford in Kent, east of junction 10, to support the development of South Ashford which has been identified as a growth area in the South East. In May 2012, it was announced that the scheme would be postponed for the short-term future. Planning recommenced in 2016. Work started on building the scheme in January 2018, with works planned to complete in May 2020. The coast-facing sliproads at the existing Junction 10 were closed to allow the final works on the London-facing sliproads at Junction 10a and the new junction opened on 31 October 2019.

==Operation Stack and Operation Brock==

Since the opening of the Channel Tunnel, sections of the M20 have been used occasionally for the implementation of Operation Stack, should the ferries and/or Channel Tunnel stop running. This closes that part of the motorway and uses the area as a lorry park until the ferries and/or Channel Tunnel are fully running again.

Operation Brock was the replacement for Stack, to be used in the event of no-deal Brexit.

In July 2020, the government announced that it had bought a site beside junction 10A to build the Sevington customs clearance facility and lorry park.

==Junctions==

Data from driver location signs are used to provide distance in kilometres and carriageway identifier information. Where a junction spans several hundred metres and start and end points are available, both are cited.

<text>Sir Alexander Richardson Binnie (26 March 1839 – 18 May 1917) was a British civil engineer responsible for several major engineering projects, including several associated with crossings of the River Thames in London.

He was born in London to a Scottish father, Alexander Binnie, and Hannah Carr from Castle Sowerby, Cumberland. He was baptised at the Swallow Street Scotch Church, where his grandfather Alexander Birnie was an elder. He trained as an engineer by being articled in 1858 to Terence Flannagan and afterwards to Frederic la Trobe Bateman. He then worked on railways in mid-Wales before moving in 1868 to India to engineer the Nagpur water supply system. He received the Telford Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1875 for his paper on the Nagpur waterworks.

In 1875, he returned to England as Chief Engineer for Waterworks for the City of Bradford, West Yorkshire where he was concerned with the repair and construction of reservoirs and large water supply projects, such as Upper Barden Reservoir. He was then offered the post of Chief Engineer for London County Council in 1890, a post he held until 1902.
As chief engineer for London County Council, his design feats included the first Blackwall Tunnel (1897) and Greenwich foot tunnel (1902) (both in Greenwich, London) and, further upstream, Vauxhall Bridge (1906).

He was knighted in 1897 by Queen Victoria for services to engineering and elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1905.

He also designed, with Sir Benjamin Baker, major parts of London&#x27;s drainage system, including east London sewage treatment works at Crossness and Barking on the south and north sides of the Thames respectively (these were sited at the ends of the sewer outfalls created by Sir Joseph Bazalgette during the late 19th century). 

==Legacy==
Like several other notable engineers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (e.g. Sir William Halcrow, Sir Alexander Gibb), Binnie founded a firm under his name, which his son William took over on his father&#x27;s retirement. In 1909, Sir Alexander Binnie and Son merged with another engineering consultancy to become Sir Alexander Binnie, Son &amp; Deacon; later it became Binnie &amp; Partners, and from the 1990s it was part of the multi-national Black &amp; Veatch consultancy. In January 2021, the Europe and Asian water businesses of Black &amp; Veatch were acquired by RSK Group and renamed Binnies.

==Personal life==
Binnie married, in 1865, Mary Frances Eames, the daughter of Dr. William J. Eames, of Londonderry. Lady Binnie died in London 21 September 1901.

<doc id="341473" wikidata="Q2337283" url="?curid=341473" title="M56 motorway">
<text>The M56 motorway serves the Cheshire and Greater Manchester areas of England. It runs east to west from junction 4 of the M60 at Gatley, south of Manchester, to Dunkirk, approximately north of Chester. With a length of , it connects North Wales and the Wirral peninsula with much of the rest of North West England, serves business and commuter traffic heading towards Manchester, particularly that from the wider Cheshire area, and provides the main road access to Manchester Airport from the national motorway network.

Between junctions 9 and 16, the motorway forms part of the unsigned European route E22 on its route in the UK between Holyhead in Anglesey and Immingham in Lincolnshire.

==Route==
Although the main line of the motorway starts as a continuation of the A5103 Princess Parkway, the M56 begins on the Sharston Spur (also known as the Sharston Bypass) where it leaves the M60 motorway at its junction 4 (clockwise exit and anticlockwise entry), adjacent to where the slip roads for the A34 to and from Manchester merge and diverge. After passing through junctions 1 and 2, the spur joins the main line at junction 3, increasing the motorway from two lanes to four in each direction.

The motorway then heads south to the west of Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport until it reaches junction 6, where it turns west before crossing into Cheshire at the River Bollin underbridge. It runs to the south of Hale before reaching junctions 7 and 8 which are part of the same interchange complex. Junction 8 was planned to be used by the proposed A556(M), but is now a single 270-degree loop between the southbound onslip from Bowdon roundabout to the westbound carriageway since the A556 towards the M6 motorway was upgraded to dual carriageway in 2017. Traffic destined for the southbound M6 is directed to leave here (because there are no corresponding slip roads at its own junction) and so the junction can suffer from congestion. Traffic levels on the mainline drop significantly as the motorway begins to assume a more traditional feel (three lanes and a hard shoulder per direction) whilst passing between Broomedge and High Legh.

After meeting the M6 at junction 9, the motorway passes south of Appleton Thorn and Stretton before reaching the outskirts of Runcorn at junction 11, near to where it also crosses over the Bridgewater Canal and the West Coast Main Line. On the other side of the town lies junction 12, whose northern roundabout morphed into a signalised hamburger junction when the Mersey Gateway bridge was built. The concrete multi-span Weaver Viaduct (crossing both the river and its navigation course) immediately follows junction 12 and offers views of the town of Frodsham and its railway viaduct, along with the INEOS chemical plant and Rocksavage Power Station on the opposite side. Between junctions 12 and 14, it runs parallel to the River Mersey, Manchester Ship Canal, a 400kV overhead power line and the Chester-Warrington railway. After meeting the M53 motorway, the road finally returns to two lanes, it proceeds between Chester to the south and Ellesmere Port to its termination at Dunkirk, Cheshire, where it becomes the A494.

Traffic destined for North Wales can use either the M53 or the A494 to reach the A55.

The motorway is fully lit between the M60 and junction 6 (including all of its spurs) along with the junctions with both the M6 and M53.

There are two motorway service areas on the M56: Chester (operated by Roadchef) and Lymm (operated by Moto, which is also accessible from the M6).

==History==
The first proposal for a motorway across north Cheshire was mooted in 1947 in a report commissioned by Cheshire County Council, with a line for the route of the motorway being agreed in 1958 between the council and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation. The first section, announced in November 1963 by the transport minister Ernest Marples, was a southwards extension of the Princess Parkway from Wythenshawe in Manchester to the A56 and A556 at Bowdon which entered the &quot;Trunk Road Programme&quot; for 1967/1968. Construction began in 1968, and the motorway opened in stages between 1971 and 1981:

Proposals existed for an extension into North Wales across the proposed Dee Barrage, but these have never materialised.

The carriageway between junctions 4 and 6 was widened from the original dual three-lane configuration to dual four lanes during the 1990s as part of a nationwide motorway widening programme first proposed in the 1989 &quot;Roads to Prosperity&quot; white paper. Junction 5 became a lane drop/gain in both directions whereas junction 4 was reconfigured from a two-bridge roundabout to a signalised half-diamond with a single bridge.

Prior to 2008, the western end of the motorway terminated at a roundabout on the A5117. Work began in 2006 to grade-separate this junction (and others) to allow free-flowing traffic between the motorway and the A550 at Deeside in North Wales, meaning that the mainline motorway no longer connects to the roundabout (it meets the extended A494 head-on east), with the former eastbound carriageway retained as an on-slip.

==Construction==
===Wythenshawe to Gatley===
Junctions 1 to 3. The route was fixed in April 1970. 
The contract for the western section was given in February 1973 to Peter Lind &amp; Company for £1,245,700. The eastern section contract, for around £5million, was given to Leonard Fairclough &amp; Son in December 1971. The western section opened in May 1975, and the eastern section opened in March 1974.

===Bowdon to Wythenshawe===
Junctions 3a to 7, . The route was fixed in early April 1968, to start at the end of 1968. The contract was given at the end of July 1969, for £6,727,920 to Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts. It opened in January 1972.
 The tensioned central reservation barrier was made by Hill &amp; Smith of Brierley Hill, then in Staffordshire.

===Preston Brook to Bowdon===
Junctions 7 to 11, . The draft route was announced December 1969 by Fred Mulley. The inquiry was at Stockton Heath in July 1970. The route was fixed in September 1971 by Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester. In October 1972, contracts were given by Graham Page for £6.3million to Marples Ridgway for Preston Brook to Lymm, and to Robert McGregor &amp; Sons for from Lymm to Bowdon for £4.65million. The Croft Interchange (junction 9), with the M6, took up of land. Bowdon to Lymm (7 to 9) opened in December 1974. Preston Brook to Lymm (9 to 11) was opened in July 1975 by Gordon Oakes; the section should have opened in the autumn of 1974, but was held up by bad weather.

===Hapsford to Preston Brook===
Junctions 11 to 14, . The bridge over the Chester–Warrington line, at Clifton, was built with PTFE joints and rolled into place in October 1968, known as incremental launch; it was built by Leonard Fairclough &amp; Son, and designed by Husband &amp; Company.
The contract for the Hapsford to Preston Brook section was given on in November 1968, for £6.07million to Christiani-Shand, for 8miles to take 24months, and to be finished by December 1970, with main work started in December 1968. Hapsford to Sutton Weaver (12 to 14) opened in February 1971 at 11am. The A557 to Preston Brook (11 to 12), , opened in September 1971.

===Lea-by-Backford to Hapsford===
Junctions 14 to 16. Plans were extended eastwards to Lea-by-Backford. It had originally been planned as a trunk road corridor, that was belatedly upgraded to be built as a motorway, and the western section had only two lanes, much like a trunk road. The first two were contracts awarded in February 1978. The last contract of the M56 from Stoak to Lea-by-Backford was awarded in September 1978. The contract for the southerly M531 to Hoole had not yet been given.

The last section was started October 1978 by Alfred McAlpine. Percy Bilton Ltd of Stone, Staffordshire, built the Stoak Interchange itself. The M56 section opened in March 1981. The section from Stoak to Lea-by-Backford was two-lane only. The one-mile section of the two-lane M531 from the A5117 south to the M56 Stoak Interchange, was also opened on 18 March 1981, being built by Leonard Fairclough &amp; Son. The M531 would become the M53, when it fully opened in 1982. This £18million section was three months late, as construction of the Stoak Interchange had caused the hold up. Hapsford to east of Stoak cost £5.42million; the Stoak Interchange cost £4.84million; Stoak to Lea-by-Backford cost £4.32million. The M531 from Little Stanney to Stoak cost £3.46million. The final section of the M531 was to open in 1982, from south of Stoak to the A56 near Chester, built by Monk. The M531 was originally planned to be extended to cross the Chester bypass, and terminate on the A41 at Upton-by-Chester, west of Hoole. The M531 extension was planned to open mid-July 1982; the remaining M531 section opened in July 1982, costing £14million.

This contains the only section of the motorway paved with concrete, between junctions 15 and 16. Where it crosses the floodplain of the River Gowy, the carriageway sits on an embankment made of sandstone from a special-purpose quarry, which was constructed to replace existing peat deposits. The junction with the M53 at Stoak was also included in the construction contracts. The M53 Mid Wirral Motorway was mostly built in 1971; it was originally planned to terminate on the A41 at Great Sutton, with a continuation of the Chester bypass to cross an east-west trunk dual carriageway, east of the present western terminus of the M56.

==Junctions==
==Upgrades==
===Junction J6 to J8 Smart Motorway===
The government announced in August 2015 that the motorway between junctions 6 and 8 would be upgraded to a smart motorway as part of its Northern Powerhouse strategy; work began in 2020 and was completed in early 2023, originally anticipated for late 2021. The project will with the exception of the slip roads at the airport junction give the motorway four running lanes on each carriageway between junctions 6 and 8, with an already existing standard motorway with 4 lanes from junction 6 to junction 3. As the work on the lanes is finished, the temporary speed limit was increased to 60mph in March 2023, with all lanes open. The 70mph national speed limit was to be reapplied when National Highways systems finished final commissioning work.

===Junction 11a===
There was also to be a new junction 11a at Runcorn between the existing junctions 11 and 12 to relieve heavy congestion on this stretch and serve the new Mersey Gateway bridge. However, this project was cancelled by Highways England in Spring 2020 as it didn&#x27;t represent value for money.

==M56 corridor==
&quot;The M56 corridor&quot; is a term used by estate agents and social geographers to describe what is considered to be a relatively affluent area of North West England, within easy reach of the M56. The area includes the cities of Manchester and Chester, and commuter towns and villages in rural Cheshire. It also includes Warrington and Runcorn, where the chemical and pharmaceutical industries are prominent.

<doc id="341474" wikidata="Q9409" url="?curid=341474" title="Ivrea">
<text>Ivrea (; ; ; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of the Metropolitan City of Turin in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy. Situated on the road leading to the Aosta Valley (part of the medieval Via Francigena), it straddles the Dora Baltea and is regarded as the capital of the Canavese area.

Founded by the Romans under the name &quot;Eporedia,&quot; the town became the center of the March of Ivrea during the Middle Ages and briefly served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy in the 11th century. It later became part of the possessions of the House of Savoy. In the 20th century, Ivrea gained international recognition as the headquarters of the Olivetti company, a pioneer in technological innovation, known for creating some of the first computers. Thanks to Olivetti, the town also became a center of architectural innovation, with the construction of several modernist buildings that reflected the era&#x27;s progressive spirit. On July 1, 2018, the site which is known as &quot;Industrial City of the 20th Century&quot; was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The town is well known for the Ivrea Carnival, which features the famous Orange Battle as its main event, as well as for its ancient and modern architecture, including landmarks such as Ivrea Castle, Ivrea Cathedral and the Olivetti complex. It is also a growing hub for sports, particularly canoeing and kayaking, having hosted several international competitions.

== Etymology ==
The Latin name of the city was &quot;Eporedia&quot;, likely of Celtic origin. The toponym may derive from the Celtic deity Epona, specifically from the contraction of the Gaulish terms &quot;epo&quot; (related to the Ancient Greek &quot;hippos&quot;, meaning &quot;horse&quot;) and &quot;reda&quot; (&quot;four-wheeled cart&quot;). This suggests that Ivrea was already a strategic road station for horse-drawn carriages accessing the Cisalpine region. Over time, the name evolved through various forms, including &quot;Yporegia&quot;, &quot;Iporeia&quot;, &quot;Ivreia&quot;, and eventually &quot;Ivrea&quot;.

== History ==

Ivrea and its surroundings have been inhabited since the Neolithic era; the Celts are believed to have had a village in Ivrea from around the 5th century BC. However, the town first officially appears in history as an outpost of the Roman Republic founded in 100 BC, probably built to guard one of the traditional invasion routes into northern Italy over the Alps. Its Latin name was &quot;Eporedia&quot;.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Ivrea became the seat of a duchy under the Lombards (6th-8th centuries). Under the Franks (9th century), Ivrea was a county capital. In the year 1001, after a period of disputes with bishop Warmund, ruler of the city, Arduin conquered the March of Ivrea. Later he became King of Italy and began a dynasty that lasted until the 11th century, when the city fell again under the bishops&#x27; sovereignty.

In the 12th century, Ivrea became a free comune, but succumbed in the first decades of the following century to the rule of Emperor Frederick II. Later, Ivrea was disputed between the bishops, the marquisate of Monferrato and the House of Savoy.

In 1356, Ivrea was acquired by Amadeus VI of Savoy. With the exception of the brief French conquest at the end of the 16th century, Ivrea remained under the House of Savoy until 1800. It was a subsidiary title of the king of Sardinia, although the only Marquis of Ivrea was Benedetto of Savoy (who later fought in the French Revolutionary wars). On May 26, 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte entered the city along with his victorious troops, establishing control that ended in 1814 after his fall.

During the 20th century, its primary claim to fame was as the base of operations for Olivetti, a manufacturer of typewriters, mechanical calculators and, later, computers. The Olivetti company no longer has an independent existence, though its name still appears as a registered trademark on office equipment manufactured by others. In 1970, about 90,000 people, including commuters from Southern Italy, lived and worked in the Ivrea area.

The Arduino electronic platform was created at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, and takes its name from a bar named after the historical figure of Arduin of Italy. UNESCO, when it designated the city a World Heritage Site, said that it &quot;expresses a modern vision of the relationship between industrial production and architecture.&quot;

== Geography ==

Ivrea is situated at an altitude of approximately 267 meters above sea level, not far from the entrance to the Aosta Valley. It is crossed by the Dora Baltea river, a tributary of the Po, and is located in an area shaped by a large Pleistocene glacier, which over time transported numerous debris that formed a series of moraine hills, including the Serra d&#x27;Ivrea, which collectively form the Ivrea Morainic Amphitheatre.

Following the retreat of the last glaciation (around 9700 BC), the area became rich in numerous moraine lakes, which still surround the town to this day, including Lake Sirio, Lake San Michele (towards Chiaverano), Lake Pistono in Montalto Dora, Lake Nero (between Montalto Dora and Borgofranco), and Lake Campagna in Cascinette. A little farther away, there are also Lake Viverone (on the border with the province of Biella) and Lake Candia (in the lower Canavese area), along with several other small bodies of water scattered around.

A strategic road junction since ancient times, Ivrea provides access to Valchiusella to the west and the Aosta Valley to the north. To the east, roads lead to Vercelli and Milan, while to the northeast, a route connects to Biella, which is only 20 km away in a straight line and 35 km by road.

Ivrea&#x27;s historic center climbs a hill leading to Ivrea Castle and the Cathedral, while the modern part extends across the plain, occupying both banks of the Dora Baltea and the surrounding areas.

=== Climate ===
The climate is temperate, mild, and relatively humid. Winters are rarely harsh, with an average of 90 nights of frost per year.

The average temperature in January is 1.2°C, while in July, it reaches 23.1°C. The average annual precipitation amounts to 982 mm, with May being the wettest month (125 mm) and January the driest, with the least rain/snow (32 mm). This precipitation pattern defines two drier seasons, summer and winter, and two wetter seasons, spring and autumn.

Notably, in recent years, summer temperatures have consistently exceeded 35°C during the afternoon hours in July.

== Demographics ==
The town&#x27;s population peaked in the 1970s, coinciding with the height of the Olivetti company. As of 2021, Ivrea had a population of 22,604. By December 31, 2020, foreign residents amounted to 2,046 people and made up 8.88% of the population, with the largest communities being from Romania (882 residents) and Morocco (281 residents).

Since the 15th century, Ivrea has also been home to a small yet significant Jewish community. Evidence of its history includes the 19th-century synagogue and the Jewish cemetery.

== Main sights ==


*Ivrea Castle (1357), built during the reign of Amadeus VI of Savoy. It has a quadrangular plan in brick with four round towers at the corners. In 1676, a tower, used as an ammunition store, exploded after being struck by lightning. It was never rebuilt. Once a prison, the castle today houses exhibitions.
*Ivrea Cathedral, which originated from a church built here in the 4th century at the site of a pagan temple. Around AD 1000, it was reconstructed by bishop Warmondus in Romanesque-style: of that edifice the two bell towers, some columns, and the frescoed crypt remain. The latter houses an ancient Roman sarcophagus which according to tradition, preserves the relics of St. Bessus (co-patron of the city together with St. Sabinus). In 1785, it was rebuilt again in a Baroque style. The current neo-classical façade was built in the 19th century. One of the old frescoes of the interior is the &quot;A Miracle of the Blessed Pierre de Luxembourg&quot; (second half of 15th century). The sacristy has two altarpieces by Defendente Ferrari. The cathedral also houses the tomb of Blessed Thaddeus McCarthy.
*The Biblioteca Capitolare (&quot;Capitular Library&quot;), near the cathedral, houses an important collection of codices from the 7th–15th centuries.
*Church and convent of San Bernardino: small Gothic church built by the Minorites starting from 1455. It houses a cycle portraying the &quot;Life and Passion of Christ&quot; by Giovanni Martino Spanzotti (1480–1490).
*The Museum Pier Alessandro Garda has some interesting archaeological findings and a collection of Japanese art pieces. It is located on the large Piazza Pietro Ottinetti.
*The Open Air Museum of Modern Architecture, inaugurated in 2001, is a show of the main edifices (some by leading architects of the time) built by Olivetti from the 1950s onwards. These include the Western Residential Unit, the Eastern Residential Unit and the Olivetti Office Building.
*The remains of a 1st-century Roman theatre, located west of the city centre. It could hold 10,000 spectators.
*The Ponte Vecchio (Old Bridge) dates back to AD 100 and leads over to Borghetto. Originally constructed of wood, it was rebuilt in stone in 1716.
*The Ivrea Town Hall (&quot;Palazzo di Città&quot;), built in 1758. It has a bell tower decorated with hemp plants, the symbol of Canavese.
*The Tallianti Tower, dating from the 12th-13th century, and Santo Stefano Tower, dating from the 11th century. This Romanesque bell tower is the remains of St. Stephen Abbey, built in 1041 by the Benedictine order.
*Church of San Gaudenzio
*Santa Marta (late 15th-century), former church
*Cappella dei Tre Re
*Sant&#x27;Ulderico, a medieval church
*Teatro Giacosa, the town&#x27;s theatre, of neoclassical style
*Palazzo Giusiana, a Renaissance noble palace
*The remains of the Ivrea Roman Amphitheatre, dating back to the 1st century AD

== Culture ==

There are two main festivals in Ivrea, both celebrated during Catholic festivity but both rooted in more ancient city traditions. One is the Carnival, its main celebrations taking place 40 days before Easter. The other is the patronal festival of St. Savino (Sabinus of Spoleto), celebrated the week of 7 July. During the latter festivity, a horse fair takes place with a carriage exhibition and horse shows.

=== Battle of the Oranges ===

The core celebration of Ivrea carnival centres around the Battle of the Oranges. This involves some thousands of townspeople, divided into nine combat on-the-ground teams, who throw oranges at tens of cart-based teams—with considerable violence—during the last three fat carnival days: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The carnival takes place 40 days before Easter and it ends on the night of &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot; with a solemn ceremony that involves a funeral in honour of the concluded Carnival.

A &quot;Mugnaia&quot; is chosen among the citizens&#x27; spouses. The legend has that a miller&#x27;s daughter (the eponymous &quot;Mugnaia&quot;) once refused to accept the &quot;right&quot; of the local duke to spend a night with each newlywed woman and chopped his head off. Today, the carriages represent the duke&#x27;s guard and the orange throwers the revolutionaries. People wearing a red hat will not be considered part of the revolutionaries, and therefore will not have oranges thrown at them.

The origin of the tradition of throwing oranges is not well understood, particularly as oranges do not grow in the foothills of the Italian Alps and must be transported from Sicily. In 1994, an estimate of of oranges was brought to the city, mainly coming from the leftovers of the winter crop in southern Italy.

=== Cuisine ===
Eporedian cuisine is particulary appreciated for its desserts, including traditional Eporediesi biscuits, and patisserie cakes like Torta 900 and Polenta d&#x27;Ivrea. Fagioli grassi () is another traditional dish from the town.

=== Sports ===

The town&#x27;s football club, A.S.D. Montalto Ivrea, currently plays in Promozione Piemonte.

The Ivrea Rugby Club plays in C1 Piemontese.

Ivrea was a host for the 2016, 2017, and 2024 Canoe Slalom World Cup, held at the Ivrea Whitewater Stadium.

<text>Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn [[al-Mansur|ʿAbd Allāh]] al-Mahdī (; 744 or 745 – 785), better known by his regnal name al-Mahdī (, &quot;He who is guided by God&quot;), was the third Abbasid Caliph who reigned from 775 to his death in 785. He succeeded his father, al-Mansur.

==Early life==
Al-Mahdi was born in 744 or 745 AD in the village of Humeima (modern-day Jordan). His mother was called Arwa, and his father was al-Mansur. When al-Mahdi was ten years old, his father became the second Abbasid Caliph. When al-Mahdi was young, his father needed to establish al-Mahdi as a powerful figure in his own right. So, on the east bank of the Tigris, al-Mansur oversaw the construction of East Baghdad, with a mosque and royal palace at its heart. Construction in the area was also heavily financed by the Barmakids, and the area became known as Rusafa.

According to reports, he was tall, charming, and stylish; he had tan skin, a long forehead, and wavy hair. He loved women.

When he was 15 years old, al-Mahdi was sent to defeat the uprising of Abdur Rahman bin Abdul Jabbar Azdi in Khorasan. He also defeated the uprisings of Ispahbud, the governor of Tabaristan, and Astazsis, massacring more than 70,000 of his followers in Khorasan. These campaigns put Tabaristan, which was only nominally within the caliphate, firmly under Abbasid control. In 762 AD, al-Mahdi was the governor of the Abbasid Caliphate&#x27;s eastern region, based in Ray. It was here that he fell in love with al-Khayzuran (translates as &quot;bamboo&quot;), a daughter of a warlord in Herat and had several children, including the fourth and fifth future Caliphs, al-Hadi and Harun al-Rashid. Around 770 AD (153 AH), al-Mahdi was appointed as Amir al-hajj. Al-Khayzuran was gifted to Mahdi by his father.

== Reign ==
Al-Mahdi&#x27;s father, al-Mansur, died on the hajj to Mecca in 775. The throne then passed to al-Mansur&#x27;s chosen successor, his son al-Mahdi. According to Marozzi, &quot;[it] was, by the standards of the future, blood-soaked successions of the Abbasid caliphate, a model of order and decorum.&quot;

Al-Mahdi, whose nickname means &quot;Rightly-guided&quot; or &quot;Redeemer&quot;, was proclaimed caliph when his father was on his deathbed. His peaceful reign continued the policies of his predecessors.

Mahdi commenced his rule by releasing several political prisoners, expanding and decorating the holy places of Mecca and Medina, and building fountains and lofts for Hajj pilgrims. He expanded the mail service, increased his secret service, fortified cities, and increased judicial appointments. His charitable giving was also impressive.

Rapprochement with the Alids in the Caliphate occurred under al-Mahdi&#x27;s reign. The Barmakid family, which had advised the Caliphs since the days of Abu al-‘Abbās as viziers, gained even greater powers under al-Mahdi&#x27;s rule, and worked closely with the caliph to ensure the prosperity of the Abbasid state.

Al-Mahdi reigned for ten years. He imprisoned his most trusted vizier Ya&#x27;qub ibn Dawud. In the year 167 AH/ 783 AD, al-Mahdi instituted an official inquisition which led to the execution of alleged Zindiq (heretics). He was fond of music and poetry and during his caliphate many musicians and poets received his patronage and he supported musical expression and poetry across his dominion; accordingly, his son Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi (779–839) and his daughter ‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī (777-825) were both noted poets and musicians.

In 775, a Byzantine envoy, Tarath, travelled to Baghdad to convey the congratulations of the Byzantine emperor to al-Mahdi on his accession to the throne. Tarath was so pleased with the hospitality he received that he offered to put his engineering knowledge to use and build a mill that would generate annual profits, of 500,000 dirhams, equal to the cost of its construction. On completion, the envoy&#x27;s forecast proved to be correct, and so, delighted, al-Mahdi ordered that all profits should be given to the envoy, even after he left Baghdad. It is believed this continued to his death, in 780.

In 775, Al-Fadl ibn Salih was appointed governor of the region of al-Jazira north of Damascus by the caliph al-Mahdi. He moved to al-Jazira the same year. Al-Fadl returned to Damascus following his trip to Jerusalem in 780 where he accompanied al-Mahdi as part of his entourage.

While the first Abbasid caliphs were distracted with cementing their authority, the Byzantines were occupied fighting Slavic clans in Macedonia and Thrace and battling the Bulgars. Once Mahdi felt secure in his rule, he fought the Byzantines with more force than his predecessors. He increased his line of control from Syria to the Armenian frontier and claimed the strategic town of Tarsus, that linked Anatolia, Syria, and northern Iraq.

In 777 AD (160 AH) he put down the insurrection of Yusuf ibn Ibrahim in Khurasan. In the same year al-Mahdi deposed Isa ibn Musa as his successor and appointed his own son Musa al-Hadi in his place and took allegiance (&quot;bayah&quot;) for him from the nobles. 

Al-Mahdi released many Umayyads and &#x27;Alids from prison and returned their wealth and property. His son Harun would also pursue similar policies, releasing many of the Umayyads and &#x27;Alids his brother Al-Hadi had imprisoned and declaring amnesty for all political groups of the Quraysh.

Mahdi also embarked on two important military voyages, one in 779 and another in 781 with his son Harun. In this Mahdi was teaching and training his son to be the future Caliph, just as his father had prepared him.

Al-Mahdi was poisoned by one of his concubines in 785 AD (169 AH). The concubine&#x27;s name was Hasanah and she was jealous of another female slave to who Mahdi was drawing closer. She prepared a dish of sweets and placed a poisonous pear at the top of the plate. The pit of the pear was removed and replaced with a lethal paste. She sent the dish to her adversary via a servant, however, Mahdi intercepted the plate and ate the pear without hesitation. Shortly afterward, he complained of stomach pain and died that night at 43 years old.

A separate account said al-Mahdi fell off his horse while hunting and died.

==Family==
Al-Mahdi&#x27;s first concubine when he was a prince was Muhayyat. In 759–60, she gave birth to a son who died in infancy. Another concubine was Rahim, who was the mother of his oldest surviving child, Abbasa. Another was al-Khayzuran bint Atta. She was the mother of caliphs al-Hadi and Harun al-Rashid. She had another son named Isa, and a daughter named Banuqah or Banujah. She was born in Mecca and brought up in Jurash. She had two sisters, Salsal and Asma, and a brother Ghitrif. She was al-Mahdi&#x27;s favourite wife. In 761, al-Mahdi married Raytah as his first wife after his return from Khurasan. She was the daughter of Caliph al-Saffah and his wife Umm Salamah, a Makhzumite. She gave birth to two sons, Ubaydallah and Ali.

Another concubine was al-Bahtariyah, the noble-born daughter of the Persian rebel, Masmughan of Damavand, against whom Mahdi was first sent to Khurasan. Her mother was Bakand, the daughter of Isbahbadh, Farrukhan the Little. She had a sister named Smyr. She bore al-Mahdi a son named for his grandfather, Mansur, and two daughters, Sulaimah and Aliyah. Another was Shaklah, a Negress. Her father was Khwanadan, steward of Masmughan. She had a brother named Humayd. She was acquired by al-Mahdi together with al-Bahtariyah, when she was a child. He presented her to his concubine Muhayyat, who, discovering musical talent in the child, sent her to the famous school of Taif in the Hijaz for a thorough musical education. Years later al-Mahdi, then caliph, took her as his concubine. She gave birth to al-Mahdi&#x27;s powerful and dark-skinned son Ibrahim.

Another concubine was Maknunah, a singer. She was owned by al-Marwaniyyah. Al-Mahdi, while yet a prince, bought her for 100,000 silver dirhams. She found such favor with the prince that al-Khayzuran used to say, &quot;No other woman of his made my position so difficult.&quot; She gave birth to al-Mahdi&#x27;s daughter Ulayya. Another was Basbas, a singer trained at Medina. He had bought her about the same period for 17,000 gold dinars. Another was Hasanah, a Persian. She was a singer, and was al-Mahdi&#x27;s favourite concubine. She gave al-Khayzuran some uneasy moments. According to some versions, she was unintentionally but tragically involved in al-Mahdi&#x27;s death. Some other concubines were Hullah, another singer, and Malkah.

Al-Mahdi&#x27;s second wife was Asma, al-Khayzuran&#x27;s younger sister. She grew up at the court. In 775–776, al-Mahdi formed a sudden attachment for her. He then married her, settling on her a marriage portion of one million dirhams. Al-Khayzuran, who had been on the pilgrimage, learned of the marriage. After her return, al-Mahdi divorced Asma, and married al-Khayzuran as his third wife. That same year, he married his fourth wife Umm Abdallah, a noble Arab woman. The next year he married his fifth wife Ruqaiyah, an Uthmanid. After al-Mahdi&#x27;s death, she married an Alid.

==Wars with Byzantium==
In 778, the Byzantines, under Michael Lachanodrakon, seized the town of Germanikeia (Ma&#x27;rash), where they captured significant amounts of booty and took many Syrian Christians captive, and defeated an army sent against them by the Abbasid general Thumama ibn al-Walid. In the next year, the Byzantines took and razed the fortress city of Hadath, forcing Caliph al-Mahdi () to replace the rather passive Thumama with the veteran al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba. Hasan led over 30,000 troops in an invasion of Byzantine territory, but the Byzantines offered no opposition and withdrew to well-fortified towns and refuges, until a lack of supplies forced Hasan to return home without achieving much.

In response to these Byzantine successes, Caliph al-Mahdi now resolved to take the field in person. On 12 March 780, Mahdi departed Baghdad and via Aleppo marched to Hadath, which he refortified. He then advanced to Arabissus, where he left the army and returned to Baghdad. His son and heir Harun—better known by his &quot;laqab&quot;, or regnal name, al-Rashid—was left in charge of one half of the army, which raided the Armeniac Theme and took the small fort of Semaluos. Thumama, who had been entrusted with the other half, penetrated deeper into Asia Minor. He marched west as far as the Thracesian Theme, but was heavily defeated there by Lachanodrakon. In June 781, as the Arab invasion force assembled at Hadath under Abd al-Kabir, a great-great-nephew of the Caliph Umar (), and again prepared to launch their annual raid, Empress Irene called up the thematic armies of Asia Minor and placed them under the eunuch &quot;sakellarios&quot; John. The Muslims crossed into Byzantine Cappadocia over the Pass of Hadath, and were met near Caesarea by the combined Byzantine forces under Lachanodrakon. The ensuing battle resulted in a costly Arab defeat, forcing Abd al-Kabir to abandon his campaign and retreat to Syria.

This defeat infuriated the Caliph al-Mahdi, who prepared a new expedition. Intended as a show of force and a clear display of the Caliphate&#x27;s superiority, it was the largest army sent against Byzantium in the second half of the 8th century: it allegedly comprised 95,793 men, about twice the total Byzantine military establishment present in Asia Minor, and cost the Abbasid state some 1.6 million &quot;nomismata&quot;, almost as much as the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s entire annual income. His son, Harun was the nominal leader, but the Caliph took care to send experienced officers to accompany him.

===Caliph&#x27;s Invasion of Byzantine in 782===

On 9 February 782, His son, Harun departed Baghdad; the Arabs crossed the Taurus Mountains by the Cilician Gates, and swiftly took the border fortress of Magida. They then advanced along the military roads across the plateau into Phrygia. There, Harun left his lieutenant, the &quot;hadjib&quot; al-Rabi&#x27; ibn Yunus, to besiege Nakoleia and guard his rear, while another force, reportedly 30,000 men, under al-Barmaki (an unspecified member of the powerful Barmakid family, probably Yahya ibn Khalid), was sent to raid the rich western coastlands of Asia Minor. Harun himself, with the main army, advanced to the Opsician Theme. The accounts of subsequent events in the primary sources (Theophanes the Confessor, Michael the Syrian, and al-Tabari) differ on the details, but the general course of the campaign can be reconstructed.

According to Warren Treadgold, the Byzantine effort seems to have been led by Irene&#x27;s chief minister, the eunuch Staurakios, whose strategy was to avoid an immediate confrontation with Harun&#x27;s huge army, but wait until it had split up and advanced to meet its various detachments independently. The Thracesians under Lachanodrakon confronted al-Barmaki at a place called Darenos, but were defeated and suffered heavy losses (15,000 men according to Theophanes, 10,000 according to Michael the Syrian). The outcome of al-Rabi&#x27;s siege of Nakoleia is unclear, but he was probably defeated; Theophanes&#x27;s phrasing may imply that the town was taken, but Michael the Syrian reports that the Arabs suffered great losses and failed to capture it, a version of events confirmed by hagiographic sources. Al-Tabari reports that part of the main army under Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani met a Byzantine force led by a certain Niketas who was &quot;count of counts&quot; (perhaps the Count of the Opsician Theme), probably somewhere near Nicaea. In the ensuing battle, Niketas was wounded and unhorsed in single combat with the Arab general and forced to retire, probably to Nicomedia, where the imperial &quot;tagmata&quot; (professional guard regiments) under the Domestic of the Schools Anthony were assembled. Harun did not bother with them, and advanced to the town of Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus Strait from Constantinople itself. Lacking ships to cross the Bosporus, and with no intention of assaulting Constantinople in the first place, Harun probably intended this advance only as a show of force.

Furthermore, despite his success so far, Harun&#x27;s position was precarious, as the defeat of al-Rabi threatened his lines of communication with the Caliphate. Consequently, after plundering the Byzantine capital&#x27;s Asian suburbs, Harun turned his army back, but during his march along the valley of the Sangarius River, east of Nicaea, he was surrounded by the forces of the &quot;tagmata&quot; under Anthony in his rear and of the Bucellarians under their general Tatzates to his front. Fortunately for him, at this point Tatzates, an Armenian prince who had defected from his Arab-ruled homeland to the Byzantines in 760 and was closely associated with the iconoclast regime of Constantine V, secretly made contact with him. Tatzates offered to aid Harun in exchange for a pardon and a safe return for himself and his family to his native Armenia. Theophanes explains Tatzates&#x27;s actions with his hostility towards Irene&#x27;s favourite, Staurakios, but this evidently masks a broader dissatisfaction with Irene&#x27;s regime. As the German Byzantinist Ralph-Johannes Lilie writes, &quot;Tatzates did not see any big opportunities for himself under the new regime and indeed used the good chance that the situation offered him&quot;.

Thus, when Harun asked for negotiations, Irene dispatched a delegation of three of her most senior officials: the Domestic Anthony, the &quot;magistros&quot; Peter, and Staurakios himself. Confident of their military position, they neglected to secure promises for their safety or hostages of their own, so that when they arrived in the Arab camp, they were made prisoners. Coupled with the treachery of Tatzates and the unreliability of the troops under his command, Irene was now forced to negotiate for their release, especially of her trusted aide Staurakios.

The two states concluded a three-year truce in exchange for a heavy annual tribute—the Arab sources mention various amounts between 70,000 and 100,000 gold &quot;nomismata&quot;, while one also adds 10,000 pieces of silk. Tabari&#x27;s account records that the tribute amounted to &quot;ninety or seventy thousand &quot;dinars&quot;&quot;, to be paid &quot;at the beginning of April and in June every year&quot;. In addition, the Byzantines were obliged to provide provisions and guides for Harun&#x27;s army on its march home, and to hand over Tatzates&#x27;s wife and property. Harun released all his captives (5,643 according to Tabari), but kept the rich plunder he had gathered, and returned to the Caliphate in September 782. Tabari, in his account of the expedition, says that Harun&#x27;s forces captured 194,450 &quot;dinars&quot; in gold and 21,414,800 &quot;dirhams&quot; in silver, killed 54,000 Byzantines in battle and 2,090 in captivity and took over 20,000 riding animals captive while slaughtering 100,000 cattle and sheep. Tabari also reports that the amount of plunder was such that &quot;a work horse was sold for a &quot;dirham&quot; and a mule for less than ten &quot;dirhams&quot;, a coat of mail for less than a &quot;dirham&quot;, and twenty swords for a &quot;dirham&quot;&quot;—at a time when one to two &quot;dirhams&quot; was the usual daily salary of a labourer or soldier.

== Assessment and legacy ==
===Cultural and administrative aspects of his reign===
The cosmopolitan city of Baghdad blossomed during al-Mahdi&#x27;s reign. The city attracted immigrants from Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Persia, and lands as far away as Afghanistan and Spain. Baghdad was home to Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians, in addition to the growing Muslim population. It became the world&#x27;s largest city.

Al-Mahdi continued to expand the Abbasid administration, creating new &quot;diwans&quot;, or departments: for the army, the chancery, and taxation. &quot;Qadis&quot; or judges were appointed, and laws against non-Arabs were dropped.

The Barmakid family staffed these new departments. The Barmakids, who were of Persian extraction, had originally been Buddhists. Their short-lived Islamic legacy would count against them during the reign of Harun al-Rashid.

The introduction of paper from China (see Battle of Talas) in 751 had a profound effect. Paper had not yet been used in the West with the Arabs and Persians using papyrus and the Europeans using vellum. The paper-related industry boomed in Baghdad where an entire street in the city center became devoted to the sale of paper and books. The cheapness and durability of paper was a vital element in the efficient growth of the expanding Abbasid bureaucracy.

Al-Mahdi had two important religious policies: the persecution of the &quot;zanadiqa&quot;, or dualists, and the declaration of orthodoxy. Al-Mahdi focused on the persecution of the &quot;zanadiqa&quot; in order to improve his standing among the purist Shi&#x27;i, who wanted a harder line on heresies, and found the spread of syncretic Muslim-polytheist sects to be particularly virulent. Al-Mahdi declared that the caliph had the ability, and indeed the responsibility, to define the orthodox theology of Muslims to protect the &quot;umma&quot; against heresy. Al-Mahdi made great use of this broad, new power, and it would become important during the &#x27;mihna&#x27; crisis of al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s reign.

Though Mahdi fulfilled most of his national and external goals during his reign, he was not as thrifty as his predecessor and father, al-Mansur had been. Al-Mahdi was very interested in consulting with his wife, al-Khaizuran in the all important daily affairs of the government. Her commands and prohibitions in the palace were equal to her husband&#x27;s and many times she applied them outside the palace as well. Al-Mahdi did not oppose her, and he gave her a relatively free hand from the Bayt al-mal (treasury). Finally, al-Khayzuran held her own court in the harem and in her quarters where she met petitioners, both men and women, who asked her for favors or to intercede on their behalf with her husband, the caliph. These petitioners included court officials, military officers, nobles, and merchants: 
:&quot;She was dominant during Mahdi&#x27;s time, people used to come and go through her door.. . She gave ordaining and forbidding, interceded and hindered, rejections and confirmations at her own will.&quot;
Al-Mahdi vacationed for long periods of time at al-Rusafa, officially, allowed his wife, Khaizuran to run certain matters pertaining to the state, and in general, liked to have a good time. Usually he went on such trips a lot or was away from the capital during the campaign, so he allowed her to act on his behalf and officials and officers took their orders from her. Former caliphs who embarked on the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca had made the long voyage with canteens full of muddy water and satchels of dates. Mahdi saw no reason for such extreme self-restraints, instead, he traveled like royalty, and even brought ice lugged all the way from the mountains of northern Persia so that his drinks could be cold.

===Famous anecdote about al-Mahdi===
One day, al-Mahdi was out hunting deer. Shortly after embarking, Mahdi and his aide became separated from the rest of his entourage. Soon the two became exhausted and hungry and luckily found a tent belonging to a poor Bedouin and asked him if he had anything to eat. The man said yes and provided the two with bread, butter, and oil. Mahdi asked for wine, and the Bedouin gave him some. Mahdi asked the Bedouin if he knew who he was and the Bedouin, uninterested, said no he did not. Few people who did not live on the royal grounds would have known the caliph by sight. Mahdi told the Bedouin that he was a servant of the caliph. The Bedouin, impressed, said that is a good job. After another cup of wine, Mahdi asked again if the Bedouin knew who he was. The man replied that Mahdi already told him. Mahdi said no, I was lying, I am one of the top generals in the caliph&#x27;s army. After another cup of wine, the caliph pronounced that in reality, he was in fact the caliph himself! The Bedouin refused to serve Mahdi any more wine and exclaimed if he did so, next Mahdi would proclaim himself the messenger of God!

===Coinage of al-Mahdi===
Al-Mahdi used several styles of coinage but the traditional Islamic style of Gold dinar, silver dirham and Copper fals were common.
==Succession==
His elder son was Al-Hadi, the older brother of Harun al-Rashid. Al-Hadi was very dear to his father, al-Mahdi and was appointed as the first heir by his father at the age of 16 and was chosen as the leader of the army.

His second, Harun&#x27;s raids against the Byzantines elevated his political image and once he returned, he was given the &quot;laqab&quot; &quot;al-Rashid&quot;, meaning &quot;the Rightly-Guided One&quot;. He was promoted to Caliph&#x27;s heir and given the responsibility of governing the empire&#x27;s western territories, from Syria to Azerbaijan. Al-Hadi was nominated his first heir and Harun al-Rashid was named second. After al-Mahdi&#x27;s death he was succeeded by Al-Hadi. He ruled for a year and two months. Al-Hadi was succeeded by his brother Harun as per the succession plan of al-Mahdi.

<doc id="341480" wikidata="Q15527026" url="?curid=341480" title="John Elliott (businessman)">
<text>John Dorman Elliott (3 October 1941 – 23 September 2021) was an Australian businessman and state and federal president of the Liberal Party. He had also been president of the Carlton Football Club. He frequently provoked controversy due to his political affiliations, his brushes with the law, and his abrasive personal style.

==Early life and education==
Elliott was born in Melbourne on 3 October 1941. He was the son of Frank Elliott and his wife, Anita. He completed his secondary schooling at Carey Baptist Grammar School in Kew. He then attended the University of Melbourne and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) degree and later completed a Master of Business Administration degree at the Melbourne Business School.

==Career==
Elliott joined BHP for two years. He then left to do an MBA, before joining global consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company in 1966 and worked in both Australia and the United States for six years. In 1972, he acquired control of IXL, a food manufacturer listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. From there, he and his team built the company up through a string of acquisitions throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, including Australian corporate icons Elders Limited (an agricultural services concern) and Carlton &amp; United Breweries (now part of the Foster&#x27;s Group). The acquisition of Courage Breweries in the United Kingdom, followed by Carling O&#x27;Keefe Breweries in Canada- and UK-based Grand Metropolitan Breweries, made the Foster&#x27;s Group the fourth-largest brewer in the world. During this time, he was also a high-profile president of the Carlton Football Club (1983–2002) and federal president of the Liberal Party. He was an effective advocate for the club on a range of issues. During his presidency, the club won two VFL (now AFL) premierships.

In 1985, Elliott&#x27;s company, by then called Elders IXL, played an important role as a white knight in fending off Robert Holmes à Court&#x27;s attempted takeover of diversified mining company BHP. Elders bought a large share in BHP, which blocked Holmes à Court&#x27;s attempt to take control. As a result, Elliott joined the BHP board. He then attempted a management buyout of Elders, but this was unsuccessful and left his A$80 million fortune considerably reduced.
Subsequently, the National Crime Authority of Australia (NCA) investigated a foreign exchange transaction undertaken by Elders. Elliott was cleared of criminal charges. He accused the NCA of a vendetta inspired by the then-Labor government, motivated by his position as Liberal Party president. He later launched civil action for damages, which was ultimately unsuccessful.

He was also a director of a number of public companies, including BHP, National Mutual, Bridge Oil and North Limited. Elliott was a member of the Liberal Party for over thirty years. He held multiple positions in the party, including president (1987–1990), party treasurer and vice president of the Victorian division. He was chairman of the 500 Club, which he formed in the 1980s, and was the biggest donor to the Liberal Party in Victoria.

His various political involvements led to him being caricatured in &quot;Rubbery Figures&quot;, a satirical rubber puppet series that screened in Australia during the late 1980s. He was often depicted holding an Elders IXL beer can while belching or exclaiming &quot;pig&#x27;s arse&quot;.

In 1990, Elliott was a vocal supporter of the Multifunction Polis (MFP), a controversial concept to build in Australia a new &quot;technology city&quot; with a population of 100,000. At the time, the leader of the Liberal Party, Andrew Peacock, was vehemently opposed to the plan, claiming the Multifunction Polis would become an &quot;Asian enclave&quot;.

==Sports administration career==

===Carlton Football Club President=== 
Elliott became the president of the Carlton Football Club in 1983, when he replaced Ian Rice. During Elliott&#x27;s tenure as president of the Club, he oversaw a significant period of on and off field success for the club. Elliott also oversaw Carlton&#x27;s two premiership victories in 1987 and 1995. 

After the 2002 AFL season, Elliott was voted out of office as president of the Carlton Football Club, a position he had held for two decades. The club, after having finished last for the first time since 1894, was later found to have committed serious long-term breaches of the Australian Football League salary cap regulations, which resulted in a fine of $930,000, forfeited draft picks (including the prized number-one draft pick), and an ongoing prolonged period of poor results on the field. Further, in a move some thought to be ungracious given his long service to the club, his name was also removed from all signage at Carlton&#x27;s home ground at Princes Park. Elliott was then replaced by Ian Collins as President of Carlton Football Club.

==Later life==
In January 2005, he declared himself bankrupt, to be discharged in July 2008. When he died in 2021 his net worth was less than $12,000.

On television, Elliott was a regular guest panelist on the ABC television program &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;. In 2010, he appeared on the televised Dick Smith population debate, where his vision to harness Northern Australia&#x27;s excess rainfall via pipeline to the Murray–Darling headwaters in Queensland received wide support. 
In 2012, he featured on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Agony Uncles&quot; program. On radio, he regularly appeared on a program presented by his son Tom on talkback station 3AW. 

Elliott was the inaugural chairman of the Committee for Melbourne and a director of the foundation of the University of Melbourne Business School. In September 2015, he was made an honorary fellow of the school.

==Personal life==
He was divorced from the late Lorraine Elliott, a former Victorian state parliamentarian for the Liberal Party. They had three children. The eldest is Tom Elliott (born 1967), an investment banker and radio and television presenter. His daughter Caroline Elliott was vice-president of the Liberal Party in Victoria. He also had two children from his second marriage, which also ended in divorce. His second wife, Amanda Elliott, later became the first female chairperson in the Victorian Racing Club&#x27;s 153-year history.

Known for his &quot;eccentric, crass and often controversial style of business and politics&quot;, Elliott was also a long-term cigarette smoker and claimed to have considered running for the 2016 Australian Senate on a platform of &quot;Smokers&#x27; Rights&quot;.

Elliott was admitted to the Epworth Hospital in Richmond, Victoria, after suffering a fall in September 2021. He died on 23 September 2021, ten days before his 80th birthday.

<doc id="341482" wikidata="Q1068283" url="?curid=341482" title="Löwenheim–Skolem theorem">
<text>In mathematical logic, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is a theorem on the existence and cardinality of models, named after Leopold Löwenheim and Thoralf Skolem.

The precise formulation is given below. It implies that if a countable first-order theory has an infinite model, then for every infinite cardinal number &quot;κ&quot; it has a model of size &quot;κ&quot;, and that no first-order theory with an infinite model can have a unique model up to isomorphism. 
As a consequence, first-order theories are unable to control the cardinality of their infinite models.

The (downward) Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is one of the two key properties, along with the compactness theorem, that are used in Lindström&#x27;s theorem to characterize first-order logic. 
In general, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem does not hold in stronger logics such as second-order logic.

== Theorem ==

In its general form, the Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem states that for every signature &quot;σ&quot;, every infinite &quot;σ&quot;-structure &quot;M&quot; and every infinite cardinal number , there is a &quot;σ&quot;-structure &quot;N&quot; such that and such that
* if then &quot;N&quot; is an elementary substructure of &quot;M&quot;;
* if then &quot;N&quot; is an elementary extension of &quot;M&quot;.

The theorem is often divided into two parts corresponding to the two cases above. The part of the theorem asserting that a structure has elementary substructures of all smaller infinite cardinalities is known as the downward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem. The part of the theorem asserting that a structure has elementary extensions of all larger cardinalities is known as the upward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem.

== Discussion ==
Below we elaborate on the general concept of signatures and structures.

=== Concepts ===
==== Signatures ====
A signature consists of a set of function symbols &quot;S&quot;func, a set of relation symbols &quot;S&quot;rel, and a function formula_1 representing the arity of function and relation symbols. (A nullary function symbol is called a constant symbol.) In the context of first-order logic, a signature is sometimes called a language. It is called countable if the set of function and relation symbols in it is countable, and in general the cardinality of a signature is the cardinality of the set of all the symbols it contains.

A first-order theory consists of a fixed signature and a fixed set of sentences (formulas with no free variables) in that signature. Theories are often specified by giving a list of axioms that generate the theory, or by giving a structure and taking the theory to consist of the sentences satisfied by the structure.

==== Structures / Models ====
Given a signature &quot;σ&quot;, a &quot;σ&quot;-structure &quot;M&quot;
is a concrete interpretation of the symbols in &quot;σ&quot;. It consists of an underlying set (often also denoted by &quot;M&quot;) together with an interpretation of the function and relation symbols of &quot;σ&quot;. An interpretation of a constant symbol of &quot;σ&quot; in &quot;M&quot; is simply an element of &quot;M&quot;. More generally, an interpretation of an &quot;n&quot;-ary function symbol &quot;f&quot; is a function from &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot; to &quot;M&quot;. Similarly, an interpretation of a relation symbol &quot;R&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-ary relation on &quot;M&quot;, i.e. a subset of &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

A substructure of a &quot;σ&quot;-structure &quot;M&quot; is obtained by taking a subset &quot;N&quot; of &quot;M&quot; which is closed under the interpretations of all the function symbols in &quot;σ&quot; (hence includes the interpretations of all constant symbols in &quot;σ&quot;), and then restricting the interpretations of the relation symbols to &quot;N&quot;. An elementary substructure is a very special case of this; in particular an elementary substructure satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as the original structure (its elementary extension).

=== Consequences ===
The statement given in the introduction follows immediately by taking &quot;M&quot; to be an infinite model of the theory. The proof of the upward part of the theorem also shows that a theory with arbitrarily large finite models must have an infinite model; sometimes this is considered to be part of the theorem.

A theory is called categorical if it has only one model, up to isomorphism. This term was introduced by , and for some time thereafter mathematicians hoped they could put mathematics on a solid foundation by describing a categorical first-order theory of some version of set theory. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem dealt a first blow to this hope, as it implies that a first-order theory which has an infinite model cannot be categorical. Later, in 1931, the hope was shattered completely by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem.

Many consequences of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem seemed counterintuitive to logicians in the early 20th century, as the distinction between first-order and non-first-order properties was not yet understood. One such consequence is the existence of uncountable models of true arithmetic, which satisfy every first-order induction axiom but have non-inductive subsets.

Let N denote the natural numbers and R the reals. It follows from the theorem that the theory of (N, +, ×, 0, 1) (the theory of true first-order arithmetic) has uncountable models, and that the theory of (R, +, ×, 0, 1) (the theory of real closed fields) has a countable model. There are, of course, axiomatizations characterizing (N, +, ×, 0, 1) and (R, +, ×, 0, 1) up to isomorphism. 
The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that these axiomatizations cannot be first-order. 
For example, in the theory of the real numbers, the completeness of a linear order used to characterize R as a complete ordered field, is a non-first-order property.

Another consequence that was considered particularly troubling is the existence of a countable model of set theory, which nevertheless must satisfy the sentence saying the real numbers are uncountable. Cantor&#x27;s theorem states that some sets are uncountable. This counterintuitive situation came to be known as Skolem&#x27;s paradox; it shows that the notion of countability is not absolute.

== Proof sketch ==
=== Downward part ===
For each first-order formula_2-formula formula_3, the axiom of choice implies the existence of a function
:formula_4

such that, for all formula_5, either
:formula_6

or
:formula_7.

Applying the axiom of choice again we get a function from the first-order formulas formula_8 to such functions formula_9.

The family of functions formula_9 gives rise to a preclosure operator formula_11 on the power set of formula_12
:formula_13

for formula_14.

Iterating formula_11 countably many times results in a closure operator formula_16. Taking an arbitrary subset formula_14 such that formula_18, and having defined formula_19, one can see that also formula_20. Then formula_21 is an elementary substructure of formula_12 by the Tarski–Vaught test.

The trick used in this proof is essentially due to Skolem, who introduced function symbols for the Skolem functions formula_9 into the language. One could also define the formula_9 as partial functions such that formula_9 is defined if and only if formula_26. The only important point is that formula_27 is a preclosure operator such that formula_28 contains a solution for every formula with parameters in formula_29 which has a solution in formula_30 and that 
:formula_31.

=== Upward part ===
First, one extends the signature by adding a new constant symbol for every element of formula_30. The complete theory of formula_30 for the extended signature formula_34 is called the &quot;elementary diagram&quot; of formula_30. In the next step one adds formula_36 many new constant symbols to the signature and adds to the elementary diagram of formula_30 the sentences formula_38 for any two distinct new constant symbols formula_39 and formula_40. Using the compactness theorem, the resulting theory is easily seen to be consistent. Since its models must have cardinality at least formula_36, the downward part of this theorem guarantees the existence of a model formula_42 which has cardinality exactly formula_36. It contains an isomorphic copy of formula_30 as an elementary substructure.

==In other logics==

Although the (classical) Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is tied very closely to first-order logic, variants hold for other logics. For example, every consistent theory in second-order logic has a model smaller than the first supercompact cardinal (assuming one exists). The minimum size at which a (downward) Löwenheim–Skolem–type theorem applies in a logic is known as the Löwenheim number, and can be used to characterize that logic&#x27;s strength. Moreover, if we go beyond first-order logic, we must give up one of three things: countable compactness, the downward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem, or the properties of an abstract logic.

== Historical notes ==
This account is based mainly on . To understand the early history of model theory one must distinguish between &quot;syntactical consistency&quot; (no contradiction can be derived using the deduction rules for first-order logic) and &quot;satisfiability&quot; (there is a model). Somewhat surprisingly, even before the completeness theorem made the distinction unnecessary, the term &quot;consistent&quot; was used sometimes in one sense and sometimes in the other.

The first significant result in what later became model theory was &quot;Löwenheim&#x27;s theorem&quot; in Leopold Löwenheim&#x27;s publication &quot;Über Möglichkeiten im Relativkalkül&quot; (1915):

:For every countable signature &quot;σ&quot;, every &quot;σ&quot;-sentence that is satisfiable is satisfiable in a countable model.

Löwenheim&#x27;s paper was actually concerned with the more general Peirce–Schröder &quot;calculus of relatives&quot; (relation algebra with quantifiers). He also used the now antiquated notations of Ernst Schröder. For a summary of the paper in English and using modern notations see .

According to the received historical view, Löwenheim&#x27;s proof was faulty because it implicitly used Kőnig&#x27;s lemma without proving it, although the lemma was not yet a published result at the time. In a revisionist account, considers that Löwenheim&#x27;s proof was complete.

 gave a (correct) proof using formulas in what would later be called &quot;Skolem normal form&quot; and relying on the axiom of choice:

:Every countable theory which is satisfiable in a model &quot;M&quot;, is satisfiable in a countable substructure of &quot;M&quot;.

 also proved the following weaker version without the axiom of choice: 
: Every countable theory which is satisfiable in a model is also satisfiable in a countable model.
 simplified . Finally, Anatoly Ivanovich Maltsev (Анато́лий Ива́нович Ма́льцев, 1936) proved the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem in its full generality . He cited a note by Skolem, according to which the theorem had been proved by Alfred Tarski in a seminar in 1928. Therefore, the general theorem is sometimes known as the &quot;Löwenheim–Skolem–Tarski theorem&quot;. But Tarski did not remember his proof, and it remains a mystery how he could do it without the compactness theorem.

It is somewhat ironic that Skolem&#x27;s name is connected with the upward direction of the theorem as well as with the downward direction:

:&quot;I follow custom in calling Corollary 6.1.4 the upward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. But in fact Skolem didn&#x27;t even believe it, because he didn&#x27;t believe in the existence of uncountable sets.&quot; – .

:&quot;Skolem [...] rejected the result as meaningless; Tarski [...] very reasonably responded that Skolem&#x27;s formalist viewpoint ought to reckon the downward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem meaningless just like the upward.&quot; – .

:&quot;Legend has it that Thoralf Skolem, up until the end of his life, was scandalized by the association of his name to a result of this type, which he considered an absurdity, nondenumerable sets being, for him, fictions without real existence.&quot; – .

<text>The A74(M) and M74 form a major motorway in Scotland, connecting it to England. The routes connect the M8 motorway in central Glasgow to the Scottish-English border at Gretna. They are part of the unsigned international E-road network E05. Although the entire route is colloquially referred to as the M74, for more than half its length, south of Abington, the road is officially the A74(M); see &quot;naming confusion&quot; below.

==Route==
From its junction with the M8 just south of the Kingston Bridge, the newest section passes through the Glasgow districts of Govanhill, Polmadie, Oatlands and parts of the nearby towns of Rutherglen and Cambuslang, on an elevated embankment, with junctions at Kingston, Polmadie Road, Eastfield and Tollcross before connecting to the much older section of the M74. It then runs in a roughly south-easterly direction past the Clyde Valley towns of Uddingston, Bothwell, Hamilton and Motherwell, meeting the A725 road at junction 5 (Raith Interchange), before meeting the cross-country A71 at Larkhall. It passes west of Lanark and beyond Abington, where it changes into the A74(M). The road then bypasses Moffat and Lockerbie. The road then shortly enters England before becoming the M6 near Longtown.

From junction 4 southwards it is part of the E05 Euroroute from Greenock to Algeciras. North from junction 4, the E05 takes a short stretch of the M73 connecting to the M8 and then proceeds westwards through Glasgow to Greenock.

==History==

===Original M74 – 1960s===
The A74 was the original route from Glasgow to Carlisle, where it met the A7 in Carlisle city centre and the A6 south to London.

Starting in the 1930s, the single-carriageway road between Gretna and Glasgow was progressively upgraded to dual carriageway, being completed in the early 1970s with the completion of the Gretna bypass.

At the northern end, it was not possible simply to add to the existing carriageway because of the built-up nature of the area. A bypass was built as one of Scotland&#x27;s first motorways, the M74, from Draffan to Maryville, north of Uddingston, completed by 1969. Junctions were originally numbered from south to north, which was the normal convention at the time numbers increasing going away from London, as there were no plans to extend the motorway.

The northern section around Hamilton was built as three-lane dual carriageway, narrowing to two-lane dual carriageway south of junction 4. It continued as the A74 dual-carriageway from Draffan and carrying on to link with the M6 junction 44 at Carlisle.

===First extension (1984–1987)===
The southern sections, where there was no need to bypass the existing route, were not originally upgraded to motorway standard, but to dual carriageway without hard shoulders or full grade separation. The gradual construction of the M6 from Rugby (where it met the M1 to London) to Carlisle in 1970, where it terminated on the A74, meant that the route from Glasgow to London was entirely dual carriageway.

This led to calls for the already dualled A74 from Draffan to the M6 to be upgraded a second time, to motorway standard. As the government had already invested in the dual carriageway upgrade, they initially resisted these calls. In 1972 the Government agreed to extend the M74 from Draffan to today&#x27;s junction 12 at Millbank. It was built in three sections, opening 1986–87. It was constructed to dual two-lane standard, and included a bypass of Lesmahagow, as the M74.

In 1984, in preparation for the southwards extension, the junction numbers were changed to go from north to south, Raith (junction 5) on the original south to north numbering remained as junction 5, with Maryville (the most northerly junction at that time) becoming junction 4, leaving lesser numbers available for junctions for the expected continuation of the motorway northwards.

When the first southern extension opened, Draffan, originally junction 1, ceased to exist and junction 9 (the first junction on the new extension) was and still is only a southbound exit onto the old A74 just south of Blackwood village, to serve the villages of Blackwood, Kirkmuirhill, Lesmahagow and Coalburn.

===1990s extension to Scotland-England border (1992–1999)===
In 1987, the government committed to upgrading the remaining A74 from junction 12 to the M6 to motorway standard. When the first section opened, as far south as Abington (junctions 12-J13) in 1991 it was numbered M74. Following this, the government announced that the route would be completed as the M6, as the two motorways would meet head on at Carlisle. The Scottish section of the A74 was then upgraded in sections, not all contiguous, as the A74(M), a temporary number until all the sections were complete, and the English section had been constructed and connected to the M6. They were constructed with dual three-lane carriageways. In 1995, the first northern extension was opened to Fullerton Road in Glasgow, as M74. The A74 upgrades were complete by 1999.

===M6 Carlisle – Guards Mill (2004–2008)===
Plans to upgrade the English section of A74 (Cumberland Gap) from the Scottish border at Gretna to Carlisle were announced in 2004. Costing £174million, this was constructed as M6 as originally planned in the 1990s, and was opened on 5 December 2008. The project also included the construction of a new bridge crossing the River Esk. This means that there is now a continuous motorway from London to Glasgow, with four numbers (M1, M6, A74(M) and M74).

===M74 northern extension to M8 (2008–2011)===

Construction on the six-lane M74 Northern Extension or M74 Completion Scheme northwards by through the south-eastern part of Glasgow to meet the M8 started in 2008, with opening on 28 June 2011. The extension involved the demolition of the Rosebery Park football ground.

The city centre section is supposed to perform a similar role to the never-built southern flank of the Glasgow Inner Ring Road planned in the 1960s, and first set out as a scheme in the Bruce Report of the 1940s, but only half-completed. 

The scheme was opposed by JAM74, a coalition of various activist groups, led by Friends of the Earth. They successfully called for a public inquiry, which took place during 2003 and 2004. Developers mobilised discourses of blight and inflated job claims (which had expanded from 2,900-4,000 in 1994 to 44,000 in 2001) to argue for approval. The enquiry concluded that the job forecasts were &quot;not [shown] to be robust&quot; and the extension would have &quot;very serious undesirable results&quot;, including community severance and an adverse effect on the environment. First Minister Jack McConnell said the road would be authorised regardless of the inquiry&#x27;s findings.

The scheme was at the centre of a road protest from local campaigners and environmentalists; JAM74 launched an appeal against the original decision to ignore the inquiry&#x27;s advice, however the case against the road orders collapsed on the first day of the hearing in June 2006, the net effect being a further three years delay to the start of construction, adding an estimated £20m to the construction cost. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond officially launched construction on 28 May 2008. Construction was carried out by Interlink M74, a joint venture of Balfour Beatty, Morgan Est, Morrison Construction and Sir Robert McAlpine.

Archaeological mitigation was required as part of the project and was one of the largest coordinated series of excavations carried out in an industrial city in Western Europe. Due to the sheer size of the project a joint venture by Headland Archaeology and Pre-Construct Archaeology were responsible for the excavations in 2007 and 2008; during this time eight large former industrial sites were investigated involving more than a hundred archaeologists. Discoveries included the Govan Iron Works and associated workers&#x27; housing, the Caledonian Pottery, a block of 19th century tenements, a biscuit factory, urban limeworks and more. Many of the structures were in use into the 20th century. The excavation of both manufacturing and domestic sites provided a unique insight into both how objects were made and how they were used. Finds included stamped bricks from three local manufacturers, bottle and window glass fragments, and pottery stamps or transfer prints with different customer names on them.

The project&#x27;s cost far exceeded original projections. In 1999, it was expected to cost £177million. By the time the contract was awarded, it was projected at £445million. It ran under-budget at £437million. The project total is estimated to be £692million once the cost of purchasing land is included. There was a £12million allowance for grouting of old mine workings. The road was labelled &quot;Britain&#x27;s most expensive road&quot; by the &quot;Glasgow Evening Times&quot; and Green MSP Patrick Harvie said the money should instead have been used to fund active and public transport improvements.

A report issued by Transport Scotland, one year after its opening, found the scheme was achieving its key objectives, including improved journey times and providing relief to the local road network and M8.

===East End Regeneration Route===

Construction of the East End Regeneration Route (designated as the A728) made use of existing stretches of road and filler sections on previously derelict land and has the ultimate intention to connect the M74 Northern Extensions with the M8 motorway at the Provan Gas Works interchange with the M80 motorway. Phase 1 and Phase 2 from the M74 junction 1A (Polmadie) to the A89 west of Parkhead began in 2008 and was completed in 2012, but Phase 3 from Parkhead to the M80 did not follow as planned. Although plans were approved in early 2016, construction did not commence; in 2021, it was confirmed that the project was still under consideration by the council despite funding problems and opposition on environmental grounds.

===&quot;Star of Caledonia&quot;===
A new sculpture is planned near Gretna called the &quot;Star of Caledonia&quot;. One intention is for it to be viewed from the motorway, although there will be no motorway signs to indicate the structure.

==Naming confusion==

The motorway is usually referred to as the M74, as it is one continuous route and has a continuous junction numbering system, but south of Abington it is the A74(M), as noted on each sign, save for one erroneous &quot;M74&quot; sign at Gretna Green services.

One reason for this was an intended future-proofing measure. The A74(M) naming was planned only as a temporary solution for a road that would ultimately become the northern part of the M6. Indeed if an M7 motorway were ever to be built to Edinburgh, it would begin somewhere near the present junction 13 with the A702 road.

When the A74(M) was constructed in the 1990s, many of the signs were given patches with the A74(M) number: these patches can be peeled away to reveal &quot;M6&quot; underneath. One such sign, at the VOSA checkpoint at Beattock summit, states that it is the &quot;M6 South&quot;, instead of the &quot;A74 (M) South&quot;. This left an anomaly – the M74 began at Glasgow, then at junction 13 changed to A74(M) for the to the border. Meanwhile, the English section of A74 was not upgraded due to lack of funds, leaving the &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot; of dual carriageway between the three-lane motorways. Until around 1996, the change of designation to M6 once the Cumberland Gap had been closed was definite. When the Scottish Executive was established in 1999, taking over responsibility for roads in Scotland, Sarah Boyack said that &quot;We have no current plans to rename or redesignate the M74 or A74(M) motorways between Glasgow and the border as the M6&quot;.

==Junction renumbering==
When the original motorway sections were built in the 1960s, the motorway was numbered south-to-north, with Draffan at its southern terminus with the A74 dual carriageway being junction 1 and Maryville junction 6.
When the M74 was to be extended south of Draffan in the 1980s, it was renumbered, in 1984 in preparation for the opening of the southern extension, north-to-south. The Raith or Raith remained as junction 5, while Maryville became junction 4, allowing for later extension northwards, towards Glasgow. The original junction 1 at Draffan was closed, with the first new junction 9 (Blackwood) replacing it, using the southbound carriageway of the old A74 as a slip road. The remains of the semicircular access road to the southbound carriageway are still visible at Draffan Road, with the Blackwood slip road now used as an access road to new housing. In preparation for the extension to meet the M8 south of the Kingston Bridge, in 2010, junctions 1–3 of the First Northern Extension, were renumbered 2A, 3 and 3A to accommodate the new junctions.

<doc id="341486" wikidata="Q17113046" url="?curid=341486" title="Stalking horse">
<text>A stalking horse is a figure used to test a concept or mount a challenge on behalf of a third party. If the idea proves viable or popular, the third party can then declare its interest and advance the concept with little risk of failure. If the concept fails, the third party will not be tainted by association with the failed concept and can either drop the idea completely or bide its time and wait until a better moment to launch an attack. The relationship between the stalking horse and third party is usually, but not always, hidden from the public. In many cases, the scheme is one-sided, with only one party aware of the arrangement.

In hunting, it refers to a horse, or a model of a horse, behind which a hunter hides when stalking game.

==Origin==

The term &quot;stalking horse&quot; originally derived from the practice of hunting, particularly of wildfowl. Hunters noticed that many birds would flee immediately on the approach of humans, but would tolerate the close presence of animals such as horses and cattle. Hunters would therefore slowly approach their quarry by walking alongside their horses, keeping their upper bodies out of sight until the flock was within firing range. Animals trained for this purpose were called &quot;stalking horses&quot;. Sometimes mobile hides are used for a similar purpose.

An example of the practice figures in the 1972 film &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;, when Johnson and Chris Lapp (&quot;Bear Claw&quot;) are hunting elk in the Rockies:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Jeremiah&quot;: Wind&#x27;s right, but he&#x27;ll just run soon as we step out of these trees.
&quot;Bear Claw&quot;: Trick to it. Walk out on this side of your horse.
&quot;Jeremiah&quot;: What if he sees our feet?
&quot;Bear Claw&quot;: Elk don&#x27;t know how many feet a horse have!&lt;/poem&gt;

==Usage==

The term began appearing in English-language newspapers in the late 18th century. It was used to describe the Protestant branch of Christianity as &quot;a stalking horse to power&quot; in Ireland in 1785. Early examples of its use in a political context occurred in the London newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1796, the &quot;Connecticut Courant&quot; in the US in 1808 and in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in Australia in 1822.

The expression is generally used in politics and business. In politics, the circumstances may include an attempt to bring down a powerful leader, usually by members of their own party. They may also include the presentation of a bill by a minor party representative, who is also acting in the interests of a silent partner such as a larger, more risk-averse, political party. In business, the circumstances are an attempt at testing the market for a potential (hostile) takeover of a business. In each case, there is a clear understanding that the anonymous party, whether a company or an individual, has a valuable reputation that could be damaged by the failure. The stalking horse is an exercise in assessing accurately the degree of risk so that a full-blooded challenge is only mounted by the main party when there is a real likelihood of success.

The loser in the exercise appears to be the stalking horse. If the idea is viable or popular, the stalking horse person will be sidelined and the anonymous figure will take over the concept. If the concept proves unpopular, the stalking horse will suffer a negative reaction. The understanding is that the anonymous party is a major player, perhaps only a little weaker than the target itself, and the stalking horse is a minor figure who has little or no reputation to lose. The anonymous figure is not sufficiently powerful or does not have sufficient confidence in that power, to risk a direct attack first off, and the stalking horse is a form of distraction tactic to enable better positioning.

In politics, the stalking horse figure can expect patronage from the senior figure they are assisting. In business, an associated company that acts as a stalking horse may be given a share in the contracts or the market share that will result from the demise of the business rival. The loyalty in volunteering, or agreeing to be &quot;volunteered&quot;, will ensure that their name becomes known to those with power and should guarantee help in advancing their interests. As a weaker player, they can afford to wait a while for the due reward.

Alternatively, the &quot;horse&quot; may be acting in a more altruistic and self-sacrificial manner, knowing that there is no possibility of realistic reward from the third party for the exercise, and instead being motivated by duty or loyalty to do so for the greater good of the party, organization, or cause to which they both belong. In this case, the &quot;horse&quot; will probably not be a young person hoping for advancement, but an older figure at the end of their career, who volunteers as a gesture of gratitude for all the benefits they believe the cause has given them, or as a chance to go out in a blaze of glory.

In the event of failure, the anonymous party is seen as being sufficiently powerful to protect the &quot;horse&quot; from any real retribution on the part of the target, particularly since the anonymity will allow the third party to step in and pretend to be an honest broker between the &quot;horse&quot; and the target. This is a further opportunity to enhance the reputation of the third party and boost their status at the expense of the target. If the exercise is viable, the third party gains power immediately, but even if it fails it engineers an opportunity to resolve a stalemate and enhance the contender&#x27;s reputation, so that ultimate success is another step nearer, to the benefit of both the third party and the &quot;horse&quot;, who expects to slipstream in its wake.

==Examples==
===In politics===
The phenomenon occurs particularly in politics, where a junior politician acts as the stalking horse to promote the interests of a senior politician, who remains unseen in case the actions would be damaging but nevertheless wants to provoke a debate or challenge to a party colleague. In some cases, stalking horses are not working for a particular individual but may wish to provoke a response that leads others to join in. In politics, the truth about the relationship between an individual stalking horse and a candidate may never be known, as both sides may claim that the (alleged) stalking horse acted without the agreement of anyone else.

For example, in Britain, the elderly and largely unknown back-bench politician Anthony Meyer challenged and helped to bring about the eventual resignation of Margaret Thatcher in the Conservative Party leadership.

In American politics, George W. Romney believed that Nelson Rockefeller had used him as a stalking horse in the 1968 Republican Party presidential primaries by promising support, then not providing it and hinting at his own entry into the campaign.

Alan Keyes&#x27; entry into the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries after Pat Buchanan had secured victories in New Hampshire and Louisiana led many to believe that Keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the Republican Party, since Buchanan had been a well-known ardent foe of abortion and had suffered political fallout for bringing abortion and &quot;cultural war&quot; to the center of the public policy debate.

===In bankruptcy===
In bankruptcy, a stalking horse bid is a first, favorable bid solicited by the bankrupt company&#x27;s creditors strategically to prevent low-ball offers.

<doc id="341489" wikidata="Q2129820" url="?curid=341489" title="A20 road (England)">
<text>The A20 is a major road in south-east England, carrying traffic from London to Dover in Kent. Parts of the route date back to turnpikes established in the early part of the 18th century. The line of the road throughout Kent runs closely in parallel with the M20 motorway.

==Route==
===From London to the M25===
Traffic leaving London at first takes the A2 road; at New Cross in the London Borough of Lewisham the A20 begins and heads in a south-easterly direction, becoming in turn &quot;Lewisham Way&quot; and &quot; Loampit Vale&quot;. The latter road forms a large junction, where the A21 separates for Bromley. The road now runs through &quot;Lee High Road&quot; into &quot;Eltham Road&quot;, The junction with the A210 has an unusually long 41 metre yellow box junction. and continues as the &quot;Sidcup Bypass&quot;, crossing the A222 at Frognal Corner and the A224 at Crittall&#x27;s Corner. Entering Kent, it widens from two lanes to three lanes near Swanley and continues onto the M20 motorway.

====Junctions====
The main junctions on the London to M25 section are:
*New Cross one-way system (the road starts here and branches from the A2)
*Lewisham Gateway (with the A21, A2210 and A2211)
*Sutcliffe Park (with the A210 to Eltham) – the road becomes a dual carriageway east of this junction
*Clifton&#x27;s Roundabout (with the A205 South Circular)
*Fiveways, New Eltham (with the B263); this is the last at-grade junction heading out of London
*Frognal Corner (with the A222)
*Crittall&#x27;s Corner (with the A223 and A224)
*Swanley Interchange (M25 Junction 3 / M20 Junction 1)

===The M25 to Dover===
The A20 then passes the racing circuit at Brands Hatch before descending steeply from the North Downs escarpment past Wrotham then West Malling and on to the county town of Maidstone. The route beyond Maidstone travels East, through the villages of Bearsted, Harrietsham, Lenham and Charing to Ashford.

The A292 takes over the former A20 through Ashford itself, then the road emerges as it heads through Willesborough and Sellindge in the direction of Hythe. It takes a sharp turn left at Newingreen (the site of the UK&#x27;s first motel) before entering Folkestone via Cheriton, passing the vehicular entrance to the Channel Tunnel, forming part of the town&#x27;s original bypass as the trunk road from the M20. The route then follows the coastline, tunnelling through the hills and descending to the docks in Dover, where it meets the A2 again coming down from Canterbury.

==History==

Part of the route now followed by the modern road, particularly the western section, was opened as various turnpikes in the 18th century in an effort to improve coaching links between London and the Kent towns.

In the early days of the Great Britain road numbering scheme the A20 ran through Eltham, London. along Eltham Road the Sidcup Arterial Road begins, opened in 1923, which carries traffic south of the two towns instead, leaving the A210 and A211 roads following the original route. The nearby town of Swanley was bypassed in 1968, and the short link between the two bypasses was constructed in 1988 (to the south of the Ruxley Corner roundabout).
A section of the A20 in Ashford formed part of the Ashford By-Pass, a dual carriageway opened in 1957, which used to run from what is now the roundabout with Simone Weil Avenue to the Willesborough roundabout. Simone Weil Avenue is the original A20 bypass, but has been diverted to curtail at Canterbury Road. The eastern end of the old by-pass is now the M20.

The section between Maidstone and Ashford was the only link between the two separate sections of the M20 for 10 years during the 1980s, until the &quot;missing link&quot; of the motorway was completed in May 1991.

North of Folkestone the M20 becomes a dual carriageway and enters the Roundhill Tunnel before crossing over and dropping down into Dover. This part of the A20 was completed in 1993 as a project included in the Parliamentary Bill for the Channel Tunnel. During 2011, structural failures in and around the Roundhill Tunnel have caused the A20 to be closed in this area numerous times.

<doc id="341496" wikidata="Q1142134" url="?curid=341496" title="Vauxhall Bridge">
<text>Vauxhall Bridge is a Grade II* listed steel and granite deck arch bridge in central London. It crosses the River Thames in a southeast–northwest direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Pimlico on the north bank. Opened in 1906, it replaced an earlier bridge, originally known as Regent Bridge but later renamed Vauxhall Bridge, built between 1809 and 1816 as part of a scheme for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The bridge was built at a location in the river previously served by a ferry.

The building of both iterations of the bridge was problematic, with both the first and second bridges requiring several redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and operated as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane.

In 1963 it was proposed to replace the bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops, office space, hotel rooms and leisure facilities supported above the river, but the plans were abandoned because of costs. With the exception of alterations to the road layout and the balustrade, the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907. The bridge today is an important part of London&#x27;s road system and carries the A202 road and Cycle Superhighway 5 (CS5) across the Thames.

== Background ==
In the early 13th century, Anglo-Norman mercenary Falkes de Breauté built a manor house in the then empty marshlands of South Lambeth, across the River Thames from Westminster. In 1223–24, de Breauté and others revolted against Henry III; following a failed attempt to seize the Tower of London, de Breauté&#x27;s lands in England were forfeited and he was forced into exile in France and later Rome. The lands surrounding his Lambeth manor house continued to be known as Falkes&#x27; Hall, later Vauxhall.
With the exception of housing around the New Spring Gardens (later Vauxhall Gardens) pleasure park, opened in around 1661, the land at Vauxhall remained sparsely populated into the 19th century, with the nearest fixed river crossings being the bridges at Westminster, downstream, and Battersea, upstream. In 1806 a scheme was proposed by Ralph Dodd to open the south bank of the Thames for development, by building a new major road from Hyde Park Corner to Kennington and Greenwich, crossing the river upstream of the existing Westminster Bridge. The proprietors of Battersea Bridge, concerned about a potential loss of customers, petitioned Parliament against the scheme, stating that &quot;[Dodd] is a well known adventurer and Speculist, and the projector of numerous undertakings upon a large scale most if not all of which have failed&quot;, and the bill was abandoned.
In 1809 a new bill was presented to Parliament, and the proprietors of Battersea Bridge agreed to allow it to pass and to accept compensation. The (49 Geo. 3. c. cxlii) incorporated the Vauxhall Bridge Company, allowing it to raise up to £300,000 (about £ in 2025) by means of mortgages or the sale of shares, and to keep all profits from any tolls raised. From these profits, the Vauxhall Bridge Company was obliged to compensate the proprietors of Battersea Bridge for any drop in revenue caused by the new bridge.

==Old Vauxhall Bridge==

Dodd submitted a scheme for a bridge at Vauxhall of 13 arches. However, soon after the Vauxhall Bridge Act 1809 was passed, he was dismissed by the Vauxhall Bridge Company and his design was abandoned. John Rennie was commissioned to design and build the new bridge, and a stone bridge of seven arches was approved. On 9 May 1811, Lord Dundas laid the foundation stone of the bridge on the northern bank.
The Vauxhall Bridge Company ran into financial difficulties and was unable to raise more than the £300,000 stipulated in the 1809 act, and a new (52 Geo. 3. c. cxlvii) was passed permitting the company to build a cheaper iron bridge. Rennie submitted a new design for an iron bridge of eleven spans, costing far less than the original stone design. Rennie&#x27;s design was rejected, and instead construction began on a nine arch iron bridge designed by Samuel Bentham. Concerns were raised about the construction of the piers, and engineer James Walker was appointed to inspect the work. Walker&#x27;s report led to the design being abandoned for the second time, and Walker himself was appointed to design and build a bridge of nine cast-iron arches with stone piers, the first iron bridge to be built across the Thames.

On 4 June 1816, over five years after construction began, the bridge opened, initially named Regent Bridge after George, Prince Regent, but shortly afterwards renamed Vauxhall Bridge. The developers failed to pay the agreed compensation to the owners of Battersea Bridge and were taken to court; after a legal dispute lasting five years a judgement was made in favour of Battersea Bridge, with Vauxhall Bridge being obliged to pay £8,234 (about £ in 2025) compensation. As well as the compensation awarded by the courts to Battersea Bridge in 1821, the Vauxhall Bridge Act 1809 also obliged the Vauxhall Bridge Company to pay compensation to the operators of Huntley Ferry, the Sunday ferry service to Vauxhall Gardens, with the level to be decided by &quot;a jury of 24 honest, sufficient and indifferent men&quot;. The bridge cost £175,000 (about £ in 2025) to build; with the costs of approach roads and compensation payments, the total cost came to £297,000 (about £ in 2025).

===Usage===

In anticipation of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding scale, ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s 6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, the area around the bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton &amp; Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory&#x27;s workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.
Usage rose considerably in 1838 when the terminus of the London and South Western Railway was built at nearby Nine Elms. Nine Elms station proved inconvenient and unpopular with travellers, and in 1848 a new railway terminus was built closer to central London, at Waterloo Bridge station (renamed &quot;Waterloo Station&quot; in 1886), and the terminus at Nine Elms was abandoned.

With the closure of the rail terminus, Vauxhall Bridge&#x27;s main source of revenue was visitors to the Vauxhall Gardens pleasure park. In addition to people visiting the Gardens themselves, Vauxhall Gardens were used as a launch point for hot air balloon flights, and large crowds would gather on the bridge and surrounding streets to watch the flights. A large crowd also assembled on the bridge in September 1844 to watch Mister Barry, a clown from Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre, sail from Vauxhall Bridge to Westminster Bridge in a washtub towed by geese.

===Public ownership===
Despite early setbacks and the construction nearby in the 19th century of three competing bridges (Lambeth Bridge, Chelsea Bridge and Albert Bridge), the rapid urban growth of London made Vauxhall Bridge very profitable. The annual income from tolls rose from £4,977 (about £ in 2025) in its first full year of operation, to £62,392 in 1877 (about £ in 2025). The Metropolis Toll Bridges Act 1877 (40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. xcix) was passed, allowing the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW) to buy all London bridges between Hammersmith Bridge and Waterloo Bridge and free them from tolls.
In 1879 the bridge was bought by the MBW for £255,000 (about £ in 2025) and tolls on the bridge were lifted. Inspections of the bridge by the MBW following the purchase found that the two central piers were badly eroded, exposing the timber cradles on which the piers rested. Large quantities of cement in bags were laid around the wooden cradles as an emergency measure; however, the cement bags themselves soon washed away. The piers were removed, replaced by a single large central arch. By this time the bridge was in very poor condition, and in 1895 the London County Council (LCC), which had taken over from the MBW in 1889, sought and gained parliamentary approval to replace the bridge, in the (58 &amp; 59 Vict. c. cxxix). Permission was granted by Parliament to raise the projected replacement costs of £484,000 (about £ in 2025) from rates across the whole of London rather than only local residents, as a new bridge was considered to be of benefit to the whole of London.

In August 1898 a temporary wooden bridge was moved into place alongside the existing bridge, and the demolition of the old bridge began.

==New Vauxhall Bridge==
Sir Alexander Binnie, the resident engineer of the London County Council (LCC), submitted a design for a steel bridge, which proved unpopular. At the request of the LCC, Binnie submitted a new design for a bridge of five spans, to be built in concrete and faced with granite.

Work on Binnie&#x27;s design began, but was beset by problems. Leading architects condemned the design, with Arthur Beresford Pite describing it as &quot;a would-be Gothic architectural form of great vulgarity and stupid want of meaning&quot;, and T G Jackson describing the bridge designs as a sign of &quot;the utter apparent indifference of those in authority to the matter of art&quot;. Plans to build large stone abutments had to be suspended when it was found that the southern abutment would block the River Effra, which by this time had been diverted underground to serve as a storm relief sewer and which flowed into the Thames at this point. The Effra had to be rerouted to join the Thames to the north of the bridge. After the construction of the foundations and piers it was then discovered that the clay of the riverbed at this point would not be able to support the weight of a concrete bridge. With the granite piers already in place, it was decided to build a steel superstructure onto the existing piers, and a superstructure long and wide was designed by Binnie and Maurice Fitzmaurice and built by LCC engineers at a cost of £437,000 (about £ in 2025).

The new bridge was eventually opened on 26 May 1906, five years behind schedule, in a ceremony presided over by the Prince of Wales and Evan Spicer, Chairman of the LCC. Charles Wall, who had won the contract to build the superstructure of the new bridge, paid the LCC £50 for the temporary wooden bridge, comprising of timber and 580 tons of scrap metal.

===Sculpture===

The new bridge was built to a starkly functional design, and many influential architects had complained about the lack of consultation from any architects during the design process by the engineers designing the new bridge. In 1903, during the construction of the bridge, the LCC consulted with architect William Edward Riley regarding possible decorative elements that could be added to the bridge. Riley proposed erecting two pylons topped with statues at one end of the bridge, and adding decorative sculpture to the bridge piers. The pylons were rejected on grounds of cost, but following further consultation with leading architect Richard Norman Shaw it was decided to erect monumental bronze statues above the piers, and Alfred Drury, George Frampton and Frederick Pomeroy were appointed to design appropriate statues.
Frampton resigned from the project through pressure of work, and Drury and Pomeroy carried out the project, each contributing four monumental statues, which were installed in late 1907. On the upstream piers are Pomeroy&#x27;s &quot;Agriculture&quot;, &quot;Architecture&quot;, &quot;Engineering&quot; and &quot;Pottery&quot;, whilst on the downstream piers are Drury&#x27;s &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Fine Arts&quot;, &quot;Local Government&quot; and &quot;Education&quot;. Each statue weighs approximately two tons. Despite their size, the statues are little-noticed by users of the bridge as they are not visible from the bridge itself, but only from the river banks or from passing shipping.

=== Usage ===
The new bridge soon became a major transport artery and today carries the A202 and Cycle Superhighway 5 across the Thames. Originally built with tram tracks, New Vauxhall Bridge was the first in central London to carry trams. Initially it carried horse-drawn trams, but shortly after the bridge&#x27;s opening it was converted to carry the electric trams of London County Council Tramways; it continued to carry trams until the termination of tram services in 1951. In 1968 Vauxhall Bridge and Park Lane became the first roads in London to have bus lanes; during weekday evening rush hours, the central lane of the bridge was reserved for southbound buses only.

==Millbank Bridge==
During the Second World War the government was concerned that Axis bombers would target the bridge, and a temporary bridge known as Millbank Bridge was built parallel to Vauxhall Bridge, downstream. Millbank Bridge was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure, capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment. In the event, Vauxhall Bridge survived the war undamaged, and in 1948 Millbank Bridge was dismantled. Its girders were shipped to Northern Rhodesia and used to span a tributary of the Zambezi.

==The Crystal Span==
In 1963 the Glass Age Development Committee commissioned a design for a replacement bridge at Vauxhall, inspired by the design of the Crystal Palace, to be called the Crystal Span. The Crystal Span was to have been a seven-story building supported by two piers in the river, overhanging the river banks at either end. The structure itself would have been enclosed in an air conditioned glass shell. The lowest floor would have contained two three-lane carriageways for vehicles, with a layer of shops and a skating rink in the centre of the upper floors. The southern end of the upper floors was to house a luxury hotel, whilst the northern end was to house the modern art collection of the nearby Tate Gallery, which at this time was suffering from a severe shortage of display space. The roof was to have housed a series of roof gardens, observation platforms and courtyards, surrounding a large open-air theatre. The entire structure would have been long and wide. Despite much public interest in the proposals, the London County Council was reluctant to pay the estimated £7 million (£ in 2025) construction costs, and the scheme was abandoned.

==Recent history==
In 1993, a remnant of the earliest known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it. Dating to between 1550 BC and 300 BC, it consists of two rows of wooden posts, which it is believed would originally have carried a deck of some kind. It is believed that it did not cross the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the dead. As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar&#x27;s account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar&#x27;s expedition to Britain in 55 BC. The posts are still visible at extreme low tides.
Following the closure of a number of the area&#x27;s industries, in the 1970s and 1980s the land at the southern end of Vauxhall Bridge remained empty, following the failures of multiple redevelopment schemes. The most notable came in 1979 when Keith Wickenden MP, owner of the land at the immediate southern end of the bridge, proposed a large-scale redevelopment of the site. The development was to contain of office space, 100 luxury flats and a gallery to house the Tate Gallery&#x27;s modern art collection. The offices were to be housed in a tower of green glass, which was nicknamed the &quot;Green Giant&quot; and met with much opposition. The then Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, refused permission for the development and the site remained empty.

In 1988 Regalian Properties purchased the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect. Farrell designed a self-contained community of shops, housing, offices and public spaces for the site. Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought the site and design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings in the vicinity of the bridge.
In 2004 the Vauxhall Cross area at the southern end of the bridge was redeveloped as a major transport interchange, combining a large bus station with the existing National Rail and London Underground stations at Vauxhall. Immediately to the east of the southern end of the bridge, a slipway provides access for amphibious buses between the road and river.

The only significant alteration to the structure of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973, when the Greater London Council (GLC) decided to add an extra traffic lane by reducing the width of the pavements. To counter the increased load of extra traffic, the council announced the replacement of the cast-iron balustrades with low box-girder structures. Despite formal objections from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils, the GLC ignored the objections. In 2015, the extra lane of motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb-protected two-way cycle track, on the north-east side of the bridge. This forms part of Cycle Superhighway 5.

The bridge was declared a Grade II* listed structure in 2008, providing protection to preserve its character from alteration.

<text>The A66 is a major road in Northern England, which in part follows the course of the Roman road from Scotch Corner to Penrith. It runs from east of Middlesbrough in North Yorkshire to Workington in Cumbria. The road has been progressively improved with dual carriageway sections, but with stretches of single carriageway road. The road is set to be completely dualled between Scotch Corner and Penrith, with a £1.3 billion scheme being announced in March 2024.

== Route ==
From its eastern terminus between Redcar and Middlesbrough it runs past Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington mainly as two-lane dual-carriageway and single carriageway past Darlington, becoming motorway standard as the A66(M) shortly before meeting junction 57 of the A1(M). It shares the A1(M) route south to Scotch Corner, from where it continues west across the Pennines, past Brough, Appleby, Kirkby Thore, Temple Sowerby and Penrith until it reaches Junction 40 of the M6 motorway at Skirsgill Interchange, where traffic going towards Western Scotland turns onto the northbound M6. The A66 continues past Blencathra to Keswick and Cockermouth and on through the northern reaches of the Lake District before arriving at the coastal town of Workington. There is a short stretch of dual carriageway along the northern part of Bassenthwaite Lake between Keswick and Cockermouth. Whilst the eastbound section follows the straight line of the disused Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway, the westbound section has numerous bends with climbs and dips. The westbound section was closed due to flood damage in December 2015; when it re-opened in May 2016, the road had been permanently reduced to a single lane. This section has a limit monitored by average speed cameras.

== History ==

When road numbers were first designated in the 1920s, the A66 was assigned to the route between Penrith and Hull via Scotch Corner and York, mainly along former Roman roads. Today&#x27;s route largely follows the original route between Penrith and Scotch Corner. The historic route between Scotch Corner and Hull follows what is now today&#x27;s A1, A168, B6265, A59 and A1079.

It is anomalously numbered since west of Penrith it trespasses into numbering zone 5; this is because it originally terminated at the A6 in Penrith but was extended further west in order to create one continuous east–west route. Most of what is now the A66 west of Penrith was originally A594 – only a small stub of this road numbering remains, from Maryport to Cockermouth.

== Proposed developments ==

=== Trans-Pennine dualling ===

The middle section of the A66 between Scotch Corner on the A1(M) and Penrith on the M6 forms one of the key trans-Pennines trunk routes and has one of the worst road-safety records in the UK. Various bypasses and upgrades have been constructed since the early 1970s, giving the current mix of single and dual-carriageway sections. In 2002, after many years of local campaigning, the Transport Minister, John Spellar, gave support for the upgrading of the remaining single-carriageway sections by the Highways Agency. The first three projects began construction in early 2006 and opened in 2007 and 2008. The whole route between the A1(M) and M6 was due to be dualled by 2011, by which time the upgrade of the A1 to motorway status at Scotch Corner was planned to be complete.

After the construction of several sections commenced, it was announced that those schemes currently in the planning phase would not go ahead until 2016 at the earliest. The Highways Agency website states &quot;Other than those already committed, the Regions did not identify any other major schemes for the A66 as high priorities to receive funding. This means that there is currently no likelihood of any additional major schemes on this route being funded within the next ten-year period. However the Regional Funding Allocation process will be reviewed in due course and this will give an opportunity for the Regions to revise their priorities.&quot;

In September 2015, the government said that £500,000 would be invested into the study of the two Trans-Pennine routes of the A66 and the A69. The proposal would be for one or even both roads to be dualled wholly between the A1/A1(M) and the M6. The following year the government announced that the A66 would be dualled, but not the A69. In March 2019, project director Matt Townsend from Highways England announced plans for a public consultation from May 2019, in which it would present its plans for a £500 million spend to complete dualling the Trans-Pennine section, together with improvements at the M6 and A1(M) interchanges.

In March 2024, Transport Secretary Mark Harper approved a £1.3 billion scheme to dual the A66 in its entirety between Scotch Corner and Penrith. Work would begin on the scheme in the latter half of 2024.

Additionally, a plan to create a second crossing of the River Tees near Middlesbrough for traffic on the congested A19 road would see the widening of the A66 between Teesside Park and the Tees Viaduct interchange.

== Safety ==
The section of road between Scotch Corner and Penrith accounted for 70 deaths over ten years up until 2002, which was above the national average for single lane carriageways. Whilst the number of accidents was in line with the national average, the number of serious injuries and deaths was twice the national average; this high attrition rate was the reason for the go-ahead for the new dualled sections on the grounds of safety.

Snow gates were installed on the road between Bowes and Brough. This section is the moorland route over Stainmore summit which reaches a height of is prone to heavy snow in the winter. Both sets of gates have turnaround facilities to allow all traffic to change direction.

== Accidents and incidents ==

* 2010 A66 Keswick coach accident on 24 May 2010, three people were killed, four were seriously injured and approximately 30 people sustained less severe injuries after a car collided with a coach carrying children home from Keswick School on the A66 in Cumbria.

== A66(M) ==

The A66(M) is a spur from the A1(M) at Junction 57. It was opened in 1965 along with the A1(M) as part of the &quot;Darlington by-pass motorway&quot;. It can be accessed only by northbound traffic on the A1(M) and has an exit to this route southbound only.

<text>José Guillermo Abel López Portillo y Pacheco (; 16 June 1920 – 17 February 2004) was a Mexican writer, lawyer, and politician affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who served as the 58th president of Mexico from 1976 to 1982. López Portillo was the only official candidate in the 1976 presidential election, being the only president in recent Mexican history to win an election unopposed.

Politically, the López Portillo administration began a process of partial political openness by passing an electoral reform in 1977 [es] which loosened the requisites for the registration of political parties (thus providing dissidents from the left, many of whom had hitherto been engaged in armed conflict against the government, with a path to legally participate in national politics) and allowed for greater representation of opposition parties in the Chamber of Deputies, as well as granting amnesty to many of the guerrilla fighters from the Dirty War. On the economic front, López Portillo was the last of the so-called economic nationalist Mexican presidents. His tenure was marked by heavy investments in the national oil industry after the discovery of new oil reserves, which propelled initial economic growth, but later gave way to a severe debt crisis after the international oil prices fell in the summer of 1981, leading Mexico to declare a sovereign default in 1982. As a result of the crisis, the last months of his administration were plagued by widespread capital flight, leading López Portillo to nationalize the banks three months before leaving office, and by the end of his term Mexico had the highest external debt in the world. His presidency was also marked by widespread government corruption and nepotism.

Shortly after leaving office, during the presidency of his successor Miguel de la Madrid, numerous officials who had worked under the López Portillo administration were prosecuted for corruption, the most notorious cases being Arturo Durazo and Jorge Díaz Serrano. Although López Portillo himself was suspected of having been involved in corruption as well, he was never charged with any crimes. It was revealed after his death that he had been a CIA collaborator before he became president of Mexico.

López Portillo died from complications of pneumonia at his home in Mexico City on 17 February 2004 at the age of 83, and was buried at the Mexico City Military Cemetery.

==Early life and education==
José Guillermo Abel López Portillo y Pacheco was born on 16 June 1920 in Mexico City, to his father, José López Portillo y Weber (1888–1974), an engineer, historian, researcher, and academic, and his mother, Refugio Pacheco y Villa-Gordoa. He was the grandson of José López Portillo y Rojas, a lawyer, politician, and man of letters. Another ancestor was a Royal Judge in the Audiencia de Nueva Galicia in the eighteenth century. He was the great-great-great-grandson of José María Narváez (1768–1840), a Spanish explorer who was the first to enter the Strait of Georgia, in present-day British Columbia, and the first to view the site now occupied by Vancouver. He studied law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) before beginning his political career.

==Early career==
After graduating, he began his political career with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1959. He held several positions in the administrations of his two predecessors before being appointed to serve as finance minister under Luis Echeverría, a close friend from childhood, between 1973 and 1975.

An ideological centrist, López Portillo frequently asserted that he was &quot;neither of the right or the left&quot;.

==Presidency==
===Domestic policy===

López Portillo was elected unopposed in 1976, though in any event the PRI was so entrenched that he was effectively assured of victory when Echeverría chose him as the PRI&#x27;s candidate. To date, he is the last Mexican president to run unopposed.

When he entered office, Mexico was in the midst of an economic crisis. He undertook an ambitious program to promote Mexico&#x27;s economic development with revenues stemming from the discovery of new petroleum reserves in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco by Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the country&#x27;s publicly owned oil company. In 1980, Mexico joined Venezuela in the Pact of San José, a foreign aid project to sell oil at preferential rates to countries in Central America and the Caribbean. The economic confidence that he fostered led to a short-term boost in economic growth, but by the time he left office, the economy had deteriorated and gave way to a severe debt crisis and a sovereign default.

One of his last acts as president, announced during his annual State of the Nation address on 1 September 1982, was to order the nationalization of the country&#x27;s banking system.

During his presidential term, his critics accused him of corruption and nepotism.

An electoral reform conducted during his presidential term increased the number of members of the Chamber of Deputies to 400: 300 being elected single-member districts by plurality voting (&quot;uninominales&quot;) and 100 being elected according to proportional representation (&quot;plurinominales&quot;). The reform furthermore opened the electoral process for small opposition parties.
====Nepotism====
The López Portillo administration was notorious, more than previous administrations, for the number of relatives of the President who held public office. He appointed his sister Margarita López Portillo head of the General Directorate of Radio, Television and Cinematography (RTC), his cousin Guillermo López Portillo as the first -and only- head of the newly created National Institute of Sport (INDE, which was dissolved in 1981), and his son José Ramón López Portillo (who was described by the President as &quot;the pride of my nepotism&quot;) was appointed Subsecretary of Programming and the Budget. His daughter Paulina López Portillo also debuted as a pop singer during his Presidency, and the First Lady Carmen Romano toured Europe with the Philharmonic Orchestra of Mexico City, which was founded and financed by the government of Mexico City through her initiative &quot;to make fine arts education accessible to youths&quot;.

===Foreign policy===
In 1981, the Cancun Summit, a North-South dialogue, took place. The summit was attended by 22 heads of state and government from industrialized countries (North) and developing nations (South). During López Portillo&#x27;s presidential term, Mexico supported the Sandinista National Liberation Front in Nicaragua. In 1977, after the death of dictator Francisco Franco, Mexico resumed diplomatic relations with Spain. Also, in 1979 Pope John Paul II visited Mexico for the first time.

==Presidential succession==
In the year leading to the end of his term as president on 1 December 1982, López Portillo personally chose two candidates as possibilities to replace himself, following the succession ritual established by his party. One, Javier García Paniagua, would have been appointed if a man of greater political skill were needed. The other, ultimately his successor, was Miguel de la Madrid, who was chosen for his financial and administrative skills, which were deemed much more necessary after the devaluation of the peso in February 1982 and the subsequent economic crisis.

On 1 September 1982, at his final annual Address to the Congress (&quot;Informe de Gobierno&quot;), López Portillo gave a famous speech where he condemned businessmen and bankers responsible for capital flight, claimed that the crisis was not his fault (&quot;I&#x27;m responsible for the helm, but the storm is not my fault&quot;), announced the nationalization of the banks (&quot;They have looted us, but Mexico is not finished, they won&#x27;t loot us again!&quot;), and asked for forgiveness for his mistakes as president and the economic crisis. He famously broke into tears during his speech after asking for the forgiveness of Mexico&#x27;s poor. This passionate speech, however, did little to repair his image, and he remains one of the most unpopular Mexican presidents in recent history.

López Portillo was the last economic nationalist president to emerge from the ranks of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Subsequent presidents have all been for free trade (&quot;librecambismo&quot;).

==Personal life and death==
López Portillo&#x27;s first wife was Carmen Romano. After leaving the presidency, López Portillo divorced Romano and married in 1995 his longtime partner, the Yugoslavian-born actress Sasha Montenegro. They had two children (Nabila and Alejandro) but later separated.

He was the brother of late Mexican novelist Margarita López Portillo, who died on 8 May 2006, of natural causes.

He died in Mexico City when he was 83 years old. He was the victim of a cardiac complication generated by pneumonia. He was buried at the Mexico City Military Cemetery.

==Public image and opinion==
In a national survey conducted in 2012, 25% of respondents considered that the López Portillo administration was &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, 17% responded that it was an &quot;average&quot; administration, and 44% responded that it was a &quot;very bad&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; administration.

<doc id="341506" wikidata="Q471021" url="?curid=341506" title="Morris West">
<text>Morris Langlo West (26 April 19169 October 1999) was an Australian novelist and playwright, best known for his novels &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1959), &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Clowns of God&quot; (1981). His books were published in 27 languages and sold more than 60 million copies worldwide. Each new book he wrote after he became an established writer sold more than one million copies.

West&#x27;s works were often focused on international politics and the role of the Roman Catholic Church in international affairs. In &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; he described the election and career of a Slav as Pope, 15 years before the historic election of Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II. The sequel, &quot;The Clowns of God&quot;, described a successor Pope who resigned the papacy to live in seclusion, 32 years before the abdication of Pope Benedict XVI in 2013.

==Early life==
West was born in St Kilda, Victoria, the son of a commercial salesman. Due to the large size of his family, he was sent to live with his grandparents. He attended the Christian Brothers College, St Kilda where he was awarded the prize of Dux by Archbishop Daniel Mannix in 1929.

At the age of 14, West entered the Congregation of Christian Brothers community at St Patricks in Strathfield, Sydney, &quot;as a kind of refuge&quot; from a difficult childhood.

In 1934 he began teaching at St Thomas&#x27;s Primary School, Lewisham, living in that community until 1936. He taught at schools in Tasmania and New South Wales between 1937 and 1939, while also studying at the University of Tasmania.

He left the Christian Brothers order in 1940. He worked as a salesman and a teacher.

===War service===
In April 1941, West enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force. He was commissioned as a lieutenant and worked as a cipher officer, being eventually posted to Gladesville, New South Wales, in 1944. He was seconded from the RAAF to work for Billy Hughes, former Australian prime minister, for a time.

His first published novel, &quot;Moon in My Pocket&quot;, came out in 1945 using the pseudonym &quot;Julian Morris&quot;. He wrote it while in the air force. It was published by the Australasian Publishing Company, a branch of Harrap&#x27;s Publishing Company in London, and sold more than 10,000 copies.

==Radio producer==
West worked as publicity manager at Melbourne radio station 3DB. He moved into radio drama, setting up his own radio production company ARP, which operated from 1945 to 1954. For the next 10 years he focused on writing, directing and producing radio plays and serials.

His radio plays included &quot;The Mask of Marius Melville&quot; (1945), &quot;The Curtain Rises&quot; (1946), &quot;The Affairs of Harlequin&quot; (1951), &quot;The Prince of Peace&quot; (c. 1951), &quot;When a Girl Marries&quot; (1952), &quot;The Enchanted Island&quot; (1952), &quot;Trumpets in the Dawn&quot; (c. 1953–54) and &quot;Genesis in Juddsville&quot; (c. 1955–56).

The workload of his job and a crisis in his marital relations led to West having a nervous breakdown. He ultimately sold his company to focus on writing full-time.

==Novelist==
===Early works===
West&#x27;s first novel published under his own name was &quot;Gallows on the Sand&quot; (1955), written in seven days. He followed it with &quot;Kundu&quot; (1956), a New Guinea adventure written in three weeks. He also wrote a play, &quot;The Illusionists&quot; (1955).

West moved to Europe with his family. His third novel was &quot;The Big Story&quot; (1957), which was later filmed as &quot;The Crooked Road&quot; (1965).

A trip to Naples led to meeting Father Borrelli who worked with the street boys of Naples. This resulted in the non-fiction book &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; (1957) which was West&#x27;s first international success. According to a later profile on the author:
With this work, West not only found his way as a writer but discovered the theme that would underpin almost all of his subsequent books — the nature and misuse of power. Of the 18 novels he was to write post-1957, 15 are on this subject. This discovery was particularly felicitous for West because, it suited his talents admirably. An interesting comparison may be made with David Williamson, another writer from whom profound thinking and significant insights are not to be expected. What they have in common is a keen eye for the real world around them. By fleshing out the partially familiar, they make perceptive sense of it, demonstrating in the process that the general uneasiness and suspicion ordinary people feel about many aspects of contemporary life are well-founded. West was to show that he could identify these concerns with considerable acuity.
He wrote &quot;The Second Victory&quot; (1958) (also known as &quot;Backlash&quot; and later filmed) and under the pseudonym &quot;Michael East&quot; wrote &quot;McCreary Moves In&quot; (1958) aka &quot;The Concubine&quot;.

===Best-selling novelist===
West&#x27;s first best-selling novel was &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1959) which he spent two years writing. He sold the film rights for $250,000 and it was adapted into a play and later a film. West later said the novel earned him several million dollars.

He wrote another &quot;Michael East&quot; novel, &quot;The Naked Country&quot; (1960), which was filmed in the 1980s. &quot;Daughter of Silence&quot; (1961) was also adapted into a play.

During this time he was the Vatican correspondent for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; from 1956 to 1963. His son, C. Chris O&#x27;Hanlon, said that he spent his first 12 birthdays in 12 different countries.

&quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; (1963) was a huge success, selling over six million copies and made into a movie.

He followed it with &quot;The Ambassador&quot; (1965), &quot;The Tower of Babel&quot; (1968), &quot;Summer of the Red Wolf&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Salamander&quot; (1973). He wrote a non-fiction book, &quot;Scandal in the Assembly: A Bill of Complaints and a Proposal for Reform of the Matrimonial Laws and Tribunals of the Roman Catholic Church&quot; (1970, with Robert Francis).

He wrote a play &quot;The Heretic&quot;, based on Giordano Bruno, which was performed on the London stage in 1973. Further novels included &quot;Harlequin&quot; (1974), &quot;The Navigator&quot; (1976), &quot;Proteus&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Clowns of God&quot; (1981). In 1978 he was living in England, New York and Italy and said &quot;I&#x27;m an Australian by origin, by identity, in manners. I have never felt any destruction or diminution of my identity by having a European education, or by acquiring a fluency in three languages and living abroad.&quot; His advance of &quot;Clowns of God&quot; was £100,000. By 1981 his books had sold over 25 million copies.

West wrote the play &quot;The World is Made of Glass&quot; in 1982 for the Adelaide Festival. He turned this into a novel which was published the following year.

===Return to Australia===
In 1982 West returned home to Australia. His later novels include &quot;Cassidy&quot; (1986) (which became a mini series), &quot;Masterclass&quot; (1988), &quot;Lazarus&quot; (1990), &quot;The Ringmaster&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Lovers&quot; (1993).

In 1993, West announced that he had written his last book and a formal valedictory dinner was held in his honour. However, he found he could not retire as he had planned and wrote a further three novels and two non-fiction books: &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (1996) and &quot;Eminence&quot; (1998), plus an anthology entitled &quot;Images and Inscriptions&quot; (1997) and his memoir &quot;A View from the Ridge: The Testimony of a Twentieth-century Pilgrim&quot; (1996).

He was working on the novel &quot;The Last Confession&quot; when he died; it was posthumously published in 2000.

==Writing==
A major theme of much of West&#x27;s work was a question: When so many organisations use extreme violence towards evil ends, when and under what circumstances is it morally acceptable for their opponents to respond with violence? He stated on different occasions that his novels all deal with the same aspect of life, that is, the dilemma when sooner or later you have a situation such that nobody can tell you what to do.

West wrote with little revision. His first longhand version was usually not very different from the final printed version. Despite winning many prizes and being awarded honorary doctorates, his commercial success and his skills as a story teller, he never won the acceptance of Australia&#x27;s literary clique. In the 1998 &quot;Oxford Literary History of Australia&quot; it was stated that: &quot;Despite his international popularity, West has been surprisingly neglected by Australian literary critics.&quot; The previous edition, edited by Dame Leonie Kramer, did not mention him at all.

West was awarded the 1959 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;. In the early 1960s, he helped found the Australian Society of Authors. He presented the 1986 Playford Lecture.

==Personal life==
West was born on 26 April 1916, in St Kilda. He and his first wife, Elizabeth Harvey, had two children: Elizabeth, who became a nun, and Julian who was a wine-maker before his death in 2005. Julian and his wife Helen Grimaux had a daughter named Juliana Harriett West.

West and Elizabeth Harvey divorced, and West then married Joyce &quot;Joy&quot; Lawford. Since his first wife, Elizabeth, was still alive when he married Joy, he struggled for a church annulment of his first marriage. He was out of communion with the Roman Catholic Church for many years because of this marital situation, and he had significant issues with the church&#x27;s teachings. However, he never considered himself as anything other than a committed Catholic. Joy West said that he was a believer who attended Mass every Sunday.

West and Joy had four children together. One son, C. Chris O&#x27;Hanlon, born in 1954, changed his name at the age of 26 as a gesture of independence. After starting four books in an attempt to realise what he believed were his father&#x27;s expectations, and having to give back the advances he received from publishers when he could not finish them, he realised that he was not destined to be a writer. O&#x27;Hanlon, who suffers from a severe bipolar disorder, founded Spike Wireless, an internet design house.

Another of West&#x27;s sons, Mike, is a musician who fronted the UK independent popular music band Man from Delmonte during the late 1980s and early 1990s and has released several solo albums of New Orleans country music, especially being well known with the international touring act Truckstop Honeymoon.

West&#x27;s grandson Anthony (Ant) West is also a musician, who fronted the UK music band Futures and currently is in the UK group Oh Wonder.

West died at the age of 83 on 9 October 1999 in Clareville, New South Wales.

==Honours==
West was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours of 1985. He was upgraded to Officer of the Order in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1997.

<text>Wraysbury is a village and civil parish in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in England. It is under the western approach path of London Heathrow Airport. It is located on the east bank of the River Thames, roughly midway between Windsor and Staines-upon-Thames, and west by south-west of London. Historically part of Buckinghamshire, Wraysbury was made part of the new non-metropolitan county of Berkshire in 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. The Wraysbury Reservoir is located to the east, administratively wholly in the Spelthorne district of Surrey, although it was historically divided between Buckinghamshire and Middlesex.

==History==
Investigation by Windsor and Wraysbury Archaeological Society of a field in the centre of Wraysbury to the east of St Andrew&#x27;s Church revealed evidence of human activity in Neolithic times. Many hundreds of flint artefacts were found and are now in the care of the Windsor Museum collection. The village name was traditionally spelt &quot;Wyrardisbury&quot;; it is Anglo Saxon in origin and means &quot;Wigred&#x27;s fort&quot;. Its name is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wirecesberie&quot; and as &quot;Wiredesbur&quot; in 1195. The name is seen again as &quot;Wyrardesbury&quot; in 1422.

===Magna Carta Island and Ankerwycke===


Magna Carta Island, in the parish of Wraysbury, is one of the sites traditionally suggested for the sealing of Magna Carta in 1215. On the Ankerwycke estate in the village are the ruins of Ankerwycke Priory, a Benedictine nunnery, founded in the reign of King Henry II. One of the 50 oldest trees in the United Kingdom can be found here: at around 2,000 years old, the Ankerwycke Yew dates from the Iron Age, and is so wide that you can fit a Mini Cooper behind its trunk and not see it from the other side. Local legend says that Anne Boleyn once sat under the tree, while residing at the Ankerwycke estate, but this has not been verified. Henry Stafford, 5th Baron Stafford died at Ankerwycke in 1637. The Ankerwycke estate was bought by John Blagrove, a prominent Jamaican slave owner, who did much to improve the estate.

==Wraysbury in the 19th century==
The population of Wraysbury remained relatively static during the 19th century, with a slight increase between the 1801 return of 616 and the final census of the century which gave a population figure of 660. This compares to a population figure for Wraysbury of 3,641 in the 2001 census. For centuries, agricultural and mill work had been the principal areas of employment for the villagers; and as late as 1831, census returns show that of the 135 families in the village, 62 were employed in agriculture while 68 made their living in the mills. This compares to the most recent census in which around 12% of the population work from home and the average distance travelled to work is .

===The Wraysbury enclosure===
The enclosure of the parish of Wraysbury was ordered by a private inclosure act of 1799 and was signed by the commissioners in 1803. The map of the village was redrawn by Thomas Bainbridge and shows the distribution of the lands in the following enclosure. Immediately prior to this the common land of the village was owned by the Lord of the Manor of Wraysbury, at that time John Simon Harcourt, the church and the trustees of William Gyll Esq., although, as common land, they were subject to legal rights of pasture and grazing for copyholders and other tenants. In addition to those with legal rights over the land, the poor of the district would have had &#x27;real&#x27; or &#x27;customary rights&#x27;, for example to feed their livestock or gather wood for fuel.

The only beneficiaries from enclosure were those who could show legal rights over the common land, such as copyholders and tenants of the manor. The enclosure enshrined their rights, converting &quot;rights of common&quot; and allocating an area of land commensurate with their rights, as close to their farmhouse as was convenient. The poor were overlooked in this process, and were no longer allowed to forage for fuel or graze their animals. The smaller landowners of Wraysbury to benefit from enclosure included Nathanial Wilmot, Nathanial Matthews, Shadrach Trotman and Thomas Buckland, all of whose names had previously appeared on the Wraysbury Court rolls as copyhold owners.

===Coming of the railway===

The village saw another major change in 1848 with the arrival of the railway, which opened up employment opportunities and afforded the chance to travel easily and quickly to and from the village. In the &quot;History of Wraysbury&quot; published in 1862, G.W.J. Gyll extolled the benefits to the village:

William Thomas Buckland was the local surveyor and valuer employed to handle the compensation claims resulting from the purchases of land for the new railway. This business of &quot;Buckland &amp; Sons&quot; grew into an estate agency, which had an office in Windsor High Street for the following 150 years.

===New road and suspension bridge===
&quot;Where is Wraysbury, I can scarce find it on the map?&quot; asked an associate of G.W.J. Gyll. Once the railway had put the village on the map, the next steps were to improve road access, and more importantly, to alleviate the adverse effects of the frequent floods which often resulted in the village being cut off from the rest of the county. George Harcourt, Lord of the Manor, suggested that a new road should be built on higher ground from Bowry&#x27;s Barn to the Colne Bridge, to replace the old road which ran along ditches susceptible to flooding. The 1848 Tithe map, drawn by surveyor William Thomas Buckland showing the proposed route of the new road, can be seen at the Centre for Buckinghamshire Studies in Aylesbury. Harcourt also suggested a replacement for the old &quot;Long Bridge&quot; over the River Colne should be built, and a new suspension bridge, designed and paid for by Harcourt, was built by civil engineer Mr Dredge.

==Churches==
===Church of St Andrew===
The parish church of St Andrew is a Gothic structure, intermediate between Norman and Early English, supposed to have been built by King John. The parish registers its date from the year 1734. William Pynchon, the founder of Springfield, Massachusetts, died in Wraysbury in 1662 and was buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church.

===Nonconformists in Wraysbury===

The only place of worship in Wraysbury until 1827 was the Anglican church of St Andrew. Local farmer, surveyor and auctioneer William Thomas Buckland, wishing to provide an alternative place of worship for nonconformists, built the Wraysbury Baptist Chapel to his own design. The original Baptist meeting place was opened in 1827 and Buckland was the principal minister until his death some 40 years later. Gyll, in his &quot;History of Wraysbury&quot;, described the establishment of the chapel:

The new chapel, with its elegant slender tower, was opened on 16 October 1862; the building works had cost around £800. The striking terracotta relief panel, &quot;The City of Refuge&quot;, on the front elevation of the chapel, was created by the renowned Doulton &amp; Co artist George Tinworth and is signed with his monogram. After Buckland&#x27;s death, James Doulton, his son-in-law and a cousin of Sir Henry Doulton, took over the preaching duties. Later James&#x27; son-in-law the Reverend Arthur Gostick Shorrock took over the duties. Arthur had been a student preacher in Wraysbury in the 1880s, after which he spent 35 years as a missionary in Shaanxi, China.

==Use in film and television==
A flooded quarry in Wraysbury was used as a filming location (actually intended to be in France) in the 1985 James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. Wraysbury Stores, the main village store until May 2006, appeared in an advert for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; featuring Chris Tarrant. The stores also feature in a scene from the movie &quot;Buster&quot; starring Phil Collins.

==Landmarks and community==

Due to the various gravel pits, the River Thames, lakes and reservoirs (notably &quot;The Pond&quot;), Wraysbury has plenty of wildlife and opportunities for walks. The village has a few Sites of Special Scientific Interest with these being Wraysbury Reservoir, Wraysbury and Hythe End Gravel Pitsand. The western part of the village, roughly between the river and the B376 road, is subject to frequent significant flooding, notably in January 2003, January 2014 and February 2014. In June, Wraysbury holds its annual fete, where stands such as the local vintage and classic car clubs show off their members&#x27; vehicles. There are also activities for children and the tug-of-war held by the scouts, beavers and cubs. There are also the stands of local charities, the local school, usually giving out ice creams, and of course the church&#x27;s stands. Wraysbury Cricket Club plays on the village green and played the Marylebone Cricket Club in 2009.

Former actor Robert Rietti had a home in Wraysbury, but after his wife died in August 2008, he sold the house in 2009. Former Wraysbury resident Gordon Cullen, an architect renowned for developing the Townscape movement in post-war Britain, designed the Wraysbury Village Hall. It is one of only a few buildings he designed which were actually built. The main store in the village was Wraysbury Stores until its closure in May 2006. The building is Victorian and had been continuously occupied since the late 1800s. It was formerly a post office before becoming a general store. Its neighbours include a garage and fish and chip shop and is opposite the Perseverance pub. There are many shops located on the High Street, and there is also a park including a children&#x27;s playground which is a popular spot for dog-walkers and kite-flyers. 1st Wraysbury Scouts Group is based on the village green. The village has two railway stations: Wraysbury and Sunnymeads, both on the Staines to Windsor &amp; Eton line from Windsor to London Waterloo.

==Localities==
===Hythe End===

Hythe End is the part of the village closest to Staines, largely a linear development on Staines Road, on the eastern bank of the River Thames close to Bell Weir Lock, with a large minority of properties adjoining the riverside. Hythe End consists of several riverside homes, mainly on the Island. Gravel pits to the north containing water and reeds make up a Site of Special Scientific Interest. One of the major features of Hythe End is the river water extraction facility. This was built in 1910 by the Metropolitan Water Board to supply water from the River Thames to its works in Ashford Common via the Staines Aqueduct. This first feeds the King George VI Reservoir and continues eastwards, passing the water treatment works at Kempton Park, to provide some of the supply of the Kempton Park Reservoirs and another water treatment works at Hampton. The Buckinghamshire Way long-distance walking route begins in Hythe End, as the southernmost point of that county.

===Sunnymeads===
Sunnymeads is the linear western neighbourhood bordering the River Thames, and has its own railway station. Although long part of Wraysbury administratively, its almost uninterrupted narrow green belt that continues to render it a separate settlement. The station is unmanned with no inside waiting areas. Both during and after the Second World War, Sunnymeads was a favourite destination for Londoners who would lease or acquire plots and build modest shacks on the river. Few of these original houses still exist as they have been demolished and more permanent, larger houses have been built in their place. Sunnymeads Masonic Lodge – King John&#x27;s hunting lodge may only in name date to the time of the Magna Carta – it is a restored late 14th-century building, dating to the reign of the first Tudor king, Henry VII, which is Grade II* listed.

===Friary Island===
Friary Island is a low-lying residential island about 400 metres long and 100 metres wide. It is accessed by two bridges over a narrow branch of the River Thames.

==Politics==
At a parish level, the village is represented by eleven councillors of the Wraysbury Parish Council. At the district level, the village is part of the Datchet, Horton and Wraysbury electoral ward and is currently represented by three councillors (David Buckley and Jodie Grove of The Borough First Independents and Ewan Larcombe of the National Flood Prevention Party) in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. Nationally, since 1997 the ward has formed part of the UK Parliamentary constituency of Windsor and is currently represented by Jack Rankin of the Conservative Party. Before 1997, the town was part of the constituency of Windsor and Maidenhead which was consistently held by the Conservative Party.

<doc id="341532" wikidata="Q505203" url="?curid=341532" title="Korean calendar">
<text>Throughout its many years of history, various calendar systems have been used in Korea. Many of them were adopted from the lunar Chinese calendar system, with modifications occasionally made to accommodate Korea&#x27;s geographic location and seasonal patterns. 

The solar Gregorian calendar was adopted in 1896, by Gojong of Korea. Koreans now mostly use the Gregorian calendar; however, traditional holidays and age-reckoning for older generations are still based on the traditional lunisolar calendar.

==History==
During the early Goryeo period, the Tang-made &quot;Xuanming&quot; calendar (선명력; 宣明曆) was used until 1281. While the Tang revised the Xuanming calendar several times Korea insisted on using an unmodified version until Munjong&#x27;s reign, when several improvised calendars, such as the &quot;Sipchŏng&quot; (십정력; 十精曆), &quot;Ch&#x27;iryo&quot; (칠요력; 七曜曆), &quot;Kyŏnhaeng&quot; (견행력; 見行曆), &quot;Tun&#x27;gap&quot; (둔갑력; 遁甲曆), and &quot;T&#x27;aeil&quot; (태일력; 太一曆) calendars were created.

In 1281 (the 7th year of Chungnyeol&#x27;s reign) the Yuan-made &quot;Shòushí&quot; calendar (수시력; 授時曆) was adopted. However, Goryeo scholars tended to prefer the obsolete Xuanming calendar, which they were more accustomed to. During the late Goryeo period a revised version of Shòushí, known as the Taet&#x27;ong calendar (대통력; 大統曆) saw limited use.

Shòushí continued as the standard calendar until early Joseon when the &quot;Ch&#x27;ilchŏngsan&quot; (칠정산; 七政算) was created to serve as the first Korea-specialized calendar system during the reign of Sejong the Great. The Ch&#x27;ilchŏngsan consisted of two books, the &quot;Ch&#x27;ilchŏngsannaep&#x27;yŏn&quot; (칠정산내편; 七政算內篇) which detailed methods to accurately calculate dates and celestial movements regarding Korea&#x27;s geographic location based on the Shòushí calendar, and the &quot;Ch&#x27;ilchŏngsanoep&#x27;yŏn&quot; (칠정산외편;七政算
外篇), which was based on the &quot;Huihui Lifa&quot;. 

Beginning in 1644 (22nd year of Injo&#x27;s reign), Korean scholars began discussing the adaptation of the Qing-made Shixian calendar (), as the limitations of the Ch&#x27;ilchŏngsan became clear. Although the Shixian calendar was officially adopted in 1653 (4th year of Hyojong&#x27;s reign), it was not implemented in earnest until 1725 (1st year of Yeongjo&#x27;s reign) as Korean scholars had little knowledge of western astronomy (which heavily influenced the Shixian calendar) and the Qing were reluctant to reveal any information of their new innovation.

The traditional calendar designated its years via Korean era names from 270 to 963, then Chinese era names with Korean era names at a few times until 1894. In 1894 and 1895, the lunar calendar was used with years numbered from the foundation of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392.

The Gregorian calendar was adopted on 1 January 1896, with the Korean era name Geonyang ().
From 1945 until 1961 in South Korea, the Dangun calendar was used, where Gregorian calendar years were counted from the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BC (regarded as year one), the date of the legendary founding of Korea by Dangun. These Dangi () years were 4278 to 4294. This numbering was informally used with the Korean lunar calendar before 1945 but has only been occasionally used since 1961, and mostly in North Korea prior to 1997.

Although not being an official calendar, in South Korea, the traditional Korean calendar is still maintained by the government. The current version is based on the Shixian calendar, which was in turn revised by Jesuit scholars. 

In North Korea, the Juche calendar was used between 1997 and 2024 to number its years, based on the birth of the state&#x27;s founder Kim Il Sung.

== Features ==
* The Chinese zodiac of 12 Earthly Branches (animals), which were used for counting hours and years;
* Ten Heavenly Stems, which were combined with the 12 Earthly Branches to form a sixty-year cycle;
* Twenty-four solar terms () in the year, spaced roughly 15 days apart;
* Lunar months including leap months added every two or three years.

== Weekdays ==

Note that traditional Korean calendar has no concept of weekdays: the following are names of weekdays in the modern (Western) calendar.

== Months ==

In modern Korean language, the months of both the traditional lunisolar and Western calendars are named by prefixing Sino-Korean numerals to , the Sino-Korean word for &quot;month&quot;. Traditionally, when speaking of individuals&#x27; birth months, the months of the lunisolar calendar were named by prefixing the native Korean name of the animal associated with each Earthly Branch in the Chinese zodiac to , the native Korean word for &quot;month&quot;. Additionally, the first, eleventh, and twelfth months have other Korean names which are similar to traditional Chinese month names. However, the other traditional Chinese month names, such as &quot;Xìngyuè&quot; (&quot;apricot month&quot;) for the second month, are not used in Korean.

==Festivals==
The lunar calendar is used for the observation of traditional festivals, such as Seollal, Chuseok, and Buddha&#x27;s Birthday. It is also used for jesa memorial services for ancestors and the marking of birthdays by older Koreans.

===Traditional holidays===
There are also many regional festivals celebrated according to the lunar calendar.

<text>The Hungarian Grand Prix (, ) is a motor racing event held annually in Mogyoród at the Hungaroring. Since 1986, the race has been a round of the FIA Formula One World Championship.

==History==
===Origins===
The first Hungarian Grand Prix was held on 21 June 1936 over a track laid out in Népliget, a park in Budapest. The Mercedes-Benz, Auto Union, and the Alfa Romeo-equipped Ferrari teams all sent three cars and the event drew a very large crowd. However, politics and the ensuing war meant the end of Grand Prix motor racing in the country for fifty years.

===Hungaroring===
A major coup by Bernie Ecclestone, the 1986 Hungarian Grand Prix was the first Formula One race to take place behind the Iron Curtain. Held at the twisty Hungaroring in Mogyoród near Budapest, the race has been a mainstay of the racing calendar ever since. The first Grand Prix saw 200,000 people spectating, although tickets were expensive at the time. Today, the support is still very enthusiastic, particularly from Finns, with locals making up ten percent while the majority are visitors from Germany. The trophies are &quot;handmade by Herendi Porcelanmanufaktura Zrt with an approximate production time of six months at a cost of €40,000&quot; each.

Due to the nature of the track, narrow, twisty and often dusty because of under-use, the Hungarian Grand Prix is associated with processional races, with sometimes many cars following one another, unable to pass. Thierry Boutsen demonstrated this in 1990, keeping his slower Williams car in front of championship leader Ayrton Senna, unable to find a way by. Pit strategy is often crucial; in 1998, Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari team changed his strategy mid-race before Schumacher built up a winning margin after all the stops had been made. Passing is a rarity here, although the 1989 race saw a bullish performance from Nigel Mansell in the Ferrari, who started from 12th on the grid and passed car after car, finally taking the lead when Ayrton Senna was baulked by a slower runner. The circuit was modified slightly in 2003 in an attempt to allow more passing.

Other notable occasions in Budapest include first Grand Prix wins for Damon Hill (in 1993), Fernando Alonso (in 2003, the first Grand Prix winner from Spain, and the youngest ever Grand Prix winner at the time), Jenson Button (in an incident-packed race in 2006), Heikki Kovalainen (in 2008, who also became the 100th winner of a World Championship race), Esteban Ocon (in 2021), and Oscar Piastri (in 2024). In 1997, Damon Hill came close to winning in the technically inferior Arrows-Yamaha, but his car lost drive on the last lap causing him to coast in second place. In 2014, Lewis Hamilton finished in third, six seconds behind winner Daniel Ricciardo, despite starting the race from the pit lane.

In 2001, Michael Schumacher equalled Alain Prost&#x27;s then record 51 Grand Prix wins at the Hungaroring, a drive that secured his fourth Drivers&#x27; Championship, which also matched Prost&#x27;s career tally.

The 2006 Grand Prix was the first to be held here in wet conditions. Button took his first victory from 14th place on the grid.

In 2020, Lewis Hamilton won the Hungarian Grand Prix for an eighth time, equalling the most times a driver had won the same Grand Prix (sharing the record with Michael Schumacher who won the French Grand Prix eight times). The following year proved to be a memorable Hungarian Grand Prix; Mercedes&#x27; Valtteri Bottas was involved in a first-lap incident under wet conditions that took out multiple cars, including Max Verstappen, Lando Norris, Lance Stroll, and Sergio Pérez, along with Charles Leclerc and Daniel Ricciardo; Ricciardo and Verstappen managed to finish the race while the other drivers involved in Bottas&#x27; crash all retired. Following the resulting red flag, after which race leader Hamilton pitted for intermediates, making him the only car to start on the grid as the other drivers all started from the pits, Alpine&#x27;s Esteban Ocon ended up leading the majority of the race, going on to take Team Enstone&#x27;s first victory since 2014; Hamilton finished second after Sebastian Vettel was disqualified due to an insufficient fuel sample. The 2022 edition was won by Verstappen.

At the 2013 Hungarian Grand Prix, it was confirmed that Hungary would continue to host a Formula One race until 2021. The track was completely resurfaced for the first time in early 2016, and it was announced the Grand Prix&#x27;s deal was extended for a further 5 years, until 2026.

At the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix the contract was extended to 2032.

<text>The Black Hole is a 1979 American science fiction film directed by Gary Nelson and produced by Walt Disney Productions. The film stars Maximilian Schell, Robert Forster, Joseph Bottoms, Yvette Mimieux, Anthony Perkins and Ernest Borgnine, while the voices of the main robot characters are provided by Roddy McDowall and Slim Pickens (both uncredited). The music for the film was composed by John Barry. With a production budget of $20 million, plus another $6 million for advertising, it was at the time the most expensive picture ever produced by Disney.

In the early 1970s, the film was initially conceived as a space-themed disaster film. However, the script went through numerous iterations from various screenwriters. Disney&#x27;s effects department used novel computerized camera technology to create the visual effects. The film premiered on December 18, 1979, in London in the United Kingdom and on December 21, 1979, in the United States. It was the first film from Walt Disney Productions to receive a PG rating. The film received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $35 million at the US box office. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.

==Plot==
547 days into their trip, in an unspecified future year, the spacecraft USS &quot;Palomino&quot; has nearly completed its mission exploring deep space. The crew consists of Captain Dan Holland, First Officer Lieutenant Charlie Pizer, journalist Harry Booth, ESP-sensitive scientist Dr. Kate McCrae, the expedition&#x27;s civilian leader Dr. Alex Durant and the diminutive robot V.I.N.CENT. (&quot;Vital Information Necessary CENTralized&quot;).

As it is returning to Earth, the &quot;Palomino&quot; discovers a black hole with the apparently abandoned and long-lost USS &quot;Cygnus&quot; nearby, the same ship that McCrae&#x27;s father was aboard when it vanished 20 years ago. The &quot;Palomino&quot; decides to investigate and finds that there is a mysterious null gravity field surrounding the &quot;Cygnus&quot; that allows it to defy the massive gravitational pull of the black hole. The &quot;Palomino&quot; briefly strays outside the field and is damaged by the intense gravity, forcing it to emergency dock with the &quot;Cygnus&quot;, which no longer appears abandoned.

The cautious &quot;Palomino&quot; crew soon encounter Dr. Hans Reinhardt (one of Earth&#x27;s most brilliant scientists, according to Durant). Reinhardt explains he has been alone on the &quot;Cygnus&quot; since it encountered a meteor field and was disabled. He ordered the human crew to return to Earth without him, but Kate&#x27;s father chose to remain aboard and has since died. To replace the crew, Reinhardt built faceless, black-robed drones, sentry robots and his sinister bodyguard robot, Maximilian. Reinhardt says he intends to fly the &quot;Cygnus&quot; through the black hole because 20 years of study has shown that it is possible. Only an enamoured Durant believes him and asks if he can accompany Reinhardt.

However, the rest of the &quot;Palomino&quot; crew start to become suspicious of Reinhardt. Booth sees a drone limping, while Holland witnesses an android funeral and discovers personal items in the &quot;Cygnus&quot; crew quarters. V.I.N.CENT. meets a battered earlier model of his type named BO.B. (&quot;BiO-sanitation Battalion&quot;). BO.B explains the drones are actually what is left of the human crew, who mutinied when Reinhardt refused to return to Earth after the &quot;Cygnus&quot; was damaged. McCrae&#x27;s father was killed leading the mutiny, and the crew was lobotomized and &quot;reprogrammed&quot; to serve Reinhardt. V.I.N.CENT. uses telepathy to tell Kate. After she informs Durant what really happened, he removes a drone&#x27;s faceplate, revealing the zombie-like face of a crew member. Durant tries to flee with Kate, but is killed by Maximilian.

Reinhardt orders his robots to lobotomize Kate, but just as the process begins, she is rescued by Holland, V.I.N.CENT. and BO.B. Harry Booth tries to escape alone in the &quot;Palomino&quot;, but is shot down and fatally crashes into the &quot;Cygnus&quot;. A subsequent meteor storm and the explosion of the ship&#x27;s overstressed main power plant cause the anti-gravity generator to fail. Without its null-gravity bubble, the &quot;Cygnus&quot; quickly starts to break apart under the black hole&#x27;s huge gravitational forces.

Reinhardt and the &quot;Palomino&quot; survivors separately plan their escape in the probe ship used to study the black hole. Reinhardt orders Maximilian to prepare the ship for launch, but then a large viewscreen falls on Reinhardt, pinning him to the deck. His cries for help are not acknowledged by the lobotimized crew nor Maximilian, who ignores his master and pursues the &quot;Palomino&quot; crew as they attempt to escape.

The crew nears the probe ship before being confronted again by Maximilian. He fatally damages BO.B. before battling with V.I.N.CENT. as McCrae, Holland and Pizer continue to the probe. V.I.N.CENT. defeats his opponent by drilling into Maximilian&#x27;s armor, disabling his system and sending him hurtling into the black hole. Holland, Pizer, McCrae and V.I.N.CENT. launch the probe, which they soon realize has a pre-programmed flight path, taking them directly into the black hole.

Within the black hole, the &quot;Cygnus&quot; completely breaks apart. The drifting Reinhardt and Maximilian merge above a burning, hellish landscape populated by dark-robed spectres resembling &quot;Cygnus&quot; drones. Meanwhile, the probe ship is led through a cathedral-like arched crystal tunnel by a floating, angelic figure. After the ship emerges from a white hole, Holland, Pizer, McCrae and V.I.N.CENT. fly towards a planet near a bright star.

==Production==
===Development===
In the wake of several successful disaster films such as &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), writers Bob Barbash and Richard Landau approached Disney Studios executive story editor Frank Paris with the idea for a space-themed disaster film tentatively titled &quot;Space Station One&quot;. The writers showed Paris a preliminary sketch of their idea, and the idea was later pitched to Ron Miller, who assigned longtime studio producer Winston Hibler to help develop the project. An idea of Hibler’s was for a black hole to be featured in the story. After nearly a year of work on the project, Hibler was not satisfied with the later story drafts, so William Wood was added to rework the script. Ultimately, Hibler retired from the Disney studios. The project was later shelved until late 1975 when development resumed on the project now re-titled &quot;Space Probe One&quot;. In 1976, Hibler returned from retirement, and suggested to Miller to hire conceptual artist Robert McCall to create some pre-production visuals to help focus the story and explore some possible ideas.

Hibler also brought matte designer Peter Ellenshaw out of retirement to create conceptual designs on the proposed film. Filming took place between October 11, 1978 and April 20, 1979.

===Writing===
Four months later, director John Hough, who had just directed &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot; (1975), was approached to direct the film. Although he liked the premise, he felt the script needed more revisions, so he brought in Sumner Arthur Long for an additional rewrite. However, by summer 1976, the production team was still unsatisfied with the script, and audiences&#x27; interest in the disaster genre was steadily declining.

Hibler died in August 1976, but with the level of work already invested in the project, Miller took over the project. In October, writer Ed Coffey was added to rewrite the script. By February 1977, Jeb Rosebrook was included to restructure the story, in which the script was then changed to focus on a small core group of astronauts who would encounter a black hole, which was a phenomenon that had been a growing discussion within the scientific community.

While the script was again being rewritten, Hough left the project and decided to direct &quot;Brass Target&quot; (1978). In December 1977, Miller then approached Gary Nelson, who had just been nominated for a Primetime Emmy on the political miniseries &quot;&quot;, to direct the project. Nelson read a draft of the script and declined the offer. However, he was called back to the studio, and after observing the miniatures and matte paintings created by Ellenshaw, he agreed to direct.

Rosebrook finished his final draft in March 1978, but because Disney was still displeased with the script, Gerry Day was hired for some script doctoring. After scientific research headed by marketing director Martin Rabinovitch, the title &quot;The Black Hole&quot; was selected to convey the power and mystique of the film.

===Casting===
Nelson initially considered casting Sigourney Weaver in the role of Kate McCrae, but the head of the casting department balked at the actress&#x27; unusual name and rejected her. By October 1978, most of the actors had been cast, with the exception for Jennifer O&#x27;Neill cast as Kate McCrae. O&#x27;Neill had been told she needed to cut her hair because it would be easier to film zero-gravity scenes. Initially hesitant, she eventually agreed and brought her personal hairstylist Vidal Sassoon to the studio. O&#x27;Neill consumed multiple glasses of wine during the haircut, then left the studio noticeably inebriated and was subsequently hospitalized following a car crash, which cost her the role. Yvette Mimieux was cast the following day and agreed to have her own long hair cropped.

===Special effects===
Although &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) had revolutionized the use of computerized motion control miniature special effects, &quot;The Black Hole&quot; was shot using a blend of traditional camera techniques and newly developed computer-controlled camera technology. Disney wanted to rent equipment from Industrial Light and Magic, but it was unavailable during the film&#x27;s production period and was prohibitively expensive. In the end, Disney turned to its own engineering department, which created the ACES (Automated Camera Effects System). The computerized system allowed the camera to take double exposure photographs of the miniature models as it moves convincingly across the matte painting. It also permitted the actors to move unrestrictedly within a matte painting while the camera tracks them within a non-existent set that would be painted in later. The Mattescan system was then used to composite live-action shots onto a single matte painting while the camera is in motion on several axes. In total, 150 matte paintings were created for the film under the supervision of Harrison Ellenshaw, but only 13 were used in the film.

==Soundtrack==
In April 1979, Disney hired John Barry, best known as the composer for the &quot;James Bond&quot; films, to compose the film&#x27;s score. It was the first film score ever to be recorded digitally.

An album of highlights from the score was released on LP by Disneyland Records in 1979. The 1979 album master was made available digitally on iTunes in 2007. On August 23, 2011, Intrada Records released the complete score on compact disc. The release overcame many technical hurdles, because the format the score was recorded on, the 32-track 3M Digital Recorder, was so obscure and obsolete.

==Release==
&quot;The Black Hole&quot; premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on December 18, 1979 before opening to the public the following day. It was then released in the United States on December 21, 1979. Along with &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, released earlier the same month, &quot;The Black Hole&quot; was one of the last mainstream Hollywood films to have an overture at the start of the film. Although this was cut on subsequent television airings, the overture is included on Disney&#x27;s 2004 DVD release, the film&#x27;s 2019 Blu-ray release and streaming release on Disney+.

&quot;The Black Hole&quot; is notable for being the first Disney film to earn a PG rating because of the frequent use of &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;damn&quot; and the violent death of Dr. Alex Durant. Buena Vista Distribution had released the PG-rated sports drama film &quot;Take Down&quot; earlier the same year, but it was produced by an independent production studio. The version of the film broadcast on the Disney Channel was edited for language, with all uses of the words &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;hell&quot; removed. The film also features some subtext and metaphysical and religious themes that reflected the company&#x27;s interest in developing more adult-oriented and mainstream films. This trend eventually led the studio to create its Touchstone Pictures label, under which films considered too mature for the Walt Disney label could be released. Nelson had made the decision to omit the Disney logo for the film and use &quot;Buena Vista Productions&quot; instead.

The film had a record opening weekend for Disney with a gross of $4,738,000 from 889 theatres. During its theatrical release, the movie grossed $35.8 million in the United States and Canada, from which it returned $25 million in box office rentals.

===Marketing===
Coinciding with the film&#x27;s release, Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization based on the film. In a retrospective interview, Foster remarked that his novelization had to rationalize the scientific inaccuracies depicted in the film; the novelization also changes the final outcome: the probe ship is destroyed, but the three humans and robot merge and become, aided by Kate McRae&#x27;s psychic abilities, non-substantial beings that retain their separate identities while becoming one: &quot;They were themselves...and yet somehow strange and new, a galactic sea change that produced all of the above and a new unified mindthing that was KateCharlieDanVincent also.&quot; Around the same time, Disney used their comic strip &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Treasury of Classic Tales&quot; to promote their latest film releases. Comic book artist Mike Royer suggested fellow artist Jack Kirby draw a comic strip adaptation of the film, and Kirby accepted. The comic strip adaptation, which ran for twenty-six weeks, was scripted by Carl Fallberg with the inking done by Royer.

A separate comic book adaptation of the film published by Whitman Comics in 1980 bypasses the whole issue of what happens inside the black hole by having the crew enter the black hole on one page and emerge apparently unharmed on the next page into a parallel universe where they encounter alternate versions of Reinhardt, BO.B., Maximilian and even Frank McCrae, Kate McCrae&#x27;s father. Four issues were published. The first two issues adapted the film and the second two issues continued the story introducing a race of people called Virlights, whom they end up aiding against a rising tyrant. The rare fourth issue concludes with the promise of a fifth issue but the series was canceled before it was released. In Mexico, Editorial Novaro S.A. published the first four Whitman issues, including the fifth issue, but also released a sixth issue before the series ended. Other comic adaptations released in Europe have the crew emerging into another galaxy, thus confirming Reinhardt&#x27;s theories. While wondering if they will ever return to Earth, they decide to explore this new universe.

In the official Disney Read-Along recording and illustrated story book, the crew in the probe ship emerge safely on the other side of the black hole, while the &quot;Cygnus&quot; is &quot;crushed like an eggshell.&quot; The story ends with Captain Holland saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve been trained to find new worlds. Let&#x27;s go find one for ourselves!&quot; The children&#x27;s book line, Little Golden Books, released a book entitled &quot;The Black Hole: A Spaceship Adventure for Robots&quot;. The story involves V.I.N.CENT. and BO.B. exploring the &quot;Cygnus&quot;, visiting its gardens, encountering the &quot;humanoid robots&quot;, and escaping detection by Maximilian.

The Mego Corporation produced 6 million action figures and models of the &quot;USS Palomino&quot; from the film, released in the fall of 1979. Nabisco issued a series of plastic pencil holders in the shape of the film&#x27;s robot characters via specially marked boxes of breakfast cereal.

In 1983, Disney put out a computer learning-game spinoff, &quot;Space Probe: Math&quot;. This was a cassette containing two educational games designed for use with the Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer. The concept of the first game was that the &quot;Palomino&quot; had landed on an infected planet, Delta 5 Omega. All the crew were falling under &quot;mind diffusion&quot;, basically a viral form of fatigue. The player (aged 7–14) had to solve multiplication or division problems to save the crew. In the second game, the player had to save a primitive world&#x27;s crops, using (rectangular) area and perimeter problems.

===Home media===
In March 1980, Disney began a partnership with Fotomat Corporation in a four-city market test to make 13 selected titles available for rental on videocassette, which was to be expanded nationwide by the end of the year. In September 1980, &quot;The Black Hole&quot; was made available for purchase or rental on videocassette. In 1982, Disney announced it had partnered with RCA to release nine of their films on the CED videodisc format, of which &quot;The Black Hole&quot; was re-released in the following year. The film was re-issued on VHS and LaserDisc as an installment of the &quot;Making Your Dreams Come True&quot; promotional campaign on November 6, 1985.

On March 30, 1999, Anchor Bay Entertainment re-released the film on three separate VHS editions: Anniversary Edition, Collector&#x27;s Edition, and Limited Edition as well as on DVD. The Limited Edition VHS was contained in a collectible tin box and accompanied with nine lobby cards, a 48-page booklet about the making of the film (featuring an interview with director Gary Nelson), and a script of an abandoned alternate ending. On August 3, 2004, and May 2, 2010, Disney re-released the film on DVD that was presented in its original widescreen aspect ratio. Its bonus features included the extended theatrical trailer and a making-of featurette about the film&#x27;s visual effects.

The film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray for the first time on August 13, 2019, as a Disney Movie Club exclusive. None of the special features on previous home video releases were included. The original August 13, 2019 mistakenly omitted the opening overture. Later, on October 14, a corrected version containing the overture was released.

The film became available to stream on Disney+ when the service launched on November 12, 2019.

==Reception and legacy==
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two stars out of four upon its release, saying it &quot;takes us all the way to the rim of space only to bog us down in a talky melodrama whipped up out of mad scientists and haunted houses.&quot; Janet Maslin, reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is attractively unpretentious and at times quite snappy—among the more sensational stunts is a shot of a huge, molten meteor rolling towards a crew of tiny people, who appear to be right in its path. Its story, about a band of explorers and a wicked space tyrant who pretends to be nice, has a comic-book feeling. But as comic books go, this one is pretty much a page-turner.&quot; Gene Siskel of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; found the film to be &quot;dull&quot; and claims &quot;it takes much too long to get its less than grand finale&quot;. While he praised the film&#x27;s special effects, he was critical of the film&#x27;s cast, claiming they were &quot;dead stars in their own right. If actors get paid to express emotions, then the cast in &quot;The Black Hole&quot; doesn&#x27;t even deserve the minimum wage.&quot;

Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; acknowledged that the &quot;overpowering score, squads of menacing heavies, and, especially, two adorable robots—are straight &quot;Star Wars&quot; steals, and because, despite all this sincere flattery and a script and performances that are merely adequate, the fool thing works.&quot; He later praised the visual effects and miniature designs as an &quot;amusing mixture of the plush and technological&quot; concluding that it is &quot;good to see the Disney craftsmen doing what they do best on such a grand and risky scale.&quot; Reviewing the film in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot;, Vincent Misiano commented that &quot;In the final analysis, &quot;The Black Hole&quot; is similar to its natural namesake. Nothing can escape from it either. Not a glimmer of imagination or inspiration. Perhaps if Pluto and Mickey hadn&#x27;t been involved …&quot; In &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, Colin Greenland stated that &quot;Even more awesome than the special effects is the stupidity of the script; and the cute robots will have you reaching for a tin-opener.&quot;

Science fiction historian John Clute dismissed &quot;The Black Hole&quot; as &quot;a silly concoction&quot; where &quot;the story disappears down the hole&quot;. Phil Hardy, writing in &quot;The Aurum Film Encyclopedia&quot;, also gave the film a negative review, saying &quot;The Black Hole&quot; featured &quot;the most heavy-handed dialogue imaginable&quot; and added that the film&#x27;s climax &quot;has no dramatic power at all&quot;. Author John Kenneth Muir wrote an extensive review of the film that delved into some of the nuances and metaphysical ideas which marked &quot;The Black Hole&quot; as more adult-oriented fare than Disney had previously been involved with. In 2014, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson deemed the film to be the least scientifically accurate movie of all time. Criticizing the film, he noted, &quot;They not only got none of the physics right about falling into a black hole, had they gotten it right it would have been a vastly more interesting movie.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 43% based on 37 reviews with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;While lavishly crafted and brimming with ambitious ideas, &quot;The Black Hole&quot; probes the depths of space with an unexciting story and hokey melodrama.&quot; 

The story has been compared to &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, albeit in space.

Since the film&#x27;s release, &quot;The Black Hole&quot; has become a minor cult classic among science fiction film fans.

===Awards and nominations===
==Possible remake==
In November 2009, it was reported that Disney had plans to remake &quot;The Black Hole&quot;. Director Joseph Kosinski, who also directed Disney&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2010) and producer Sean Bailey were attached to the production.

By April 2013, Jon Spaihts, who wrote the script for the &quot;Alien&quot; prequel &quot;Prometheus&quot; (2012), had signed on as screenwriter.

In 2016, it was announced that the remake was put on hold because Spaihts&#x27; script was considered &quot;too dark for a Disney movie&quot;. Spaihts commented:&quot;Black Hole&quot; was an amazing experience. That was one of those movies I was stuck on until I cracked the beginning, and suddenly it just started to flow. I loved that script. It sits uneasily in Disney&#x27;s world as a dark epic, and Disney is in a very colorful place. They already have multiple big space epics going, so I don&#x27;t know how or whether it&#x27;ll find its way to light of day, but I sure wrote a heck of a movie and was thrilled to do it. It was very faithful to the original but clever in all the ways in that first film was silly, I hope.

In March 2018, it was reported that Emily Carmichael would be writing the screenplay.

In June 2022, Kosinski revealed that the project was initially cancelled due to having numerous similarities to Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014). However, he expressed hope at reviving it in the future.

<text>Bob Wallace (May 29, 1949 – September 20, 2002) was an American software developer, programmer and the ninth Microsoft employee. He was the first popular user of the term shareware, creator of the word processing program PC-Write, founder of the software company Quicksoft and an &quot;online drug guru&quot; who devoted much time and money into the research of psychedelic drugs.

==Biography==
Bob Wallace was born in Arlington, Virginia. He first worked on computers as a member of an Explorer Scout troop sponsored by Control Data Corp.in Bethesda, Maryland. His father was an economist who later became Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during the administration of John F. Kennedy.

Beginning in 1967, Wallace attended Brown University, where he worked on the pioneering hypertext File Retrieval and Editing System with Andries van Dam and Ted Nelson. After attending the University of California, Santa Cruz for two years (where he briefly majored in theatre), he received his undergraduate degree (1974) and master&#x27;s degree (1978) in computer science from the University of Washington.

Wallace worked at the Retail Computer Store in Seattle where he learned about Microsoft after Bill Gates put up a sign advertising for programmers. He joined Microsoft in 1978 as the 9th employee and his first project was to connect a computer to an IBM Selectric typewriter so the company could print software manuals. He was a key developer of TI BASIC. In the late 1970s, Wallace and Gates were known for their practical jokes, and one incident involved breaking into a construction site and driving bulldozers, at one point almost running over Gates&#x27;s Porsche.

In 1983, Wallace left Microsoft to form Quicksoft and distribute PC-Write using the shareware concept, which he helped originate.

In 1996, Wallace and his wife Megan Dana-Wallace, started Mind Books-a bookstore that offered publications about psychoactive plants and compounds. In 1998, they started the Promind Foundation, which helped support scientific research, public education, and harm reduction efforts related to psychedelics.

Wallace also served on the Board of Directors for the Heffter Research Institute and helped financially support the most important organizations in the field, including the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), the Heffter Research Institute, Erowid (responsible for half of Erowid&#x27;s funding from 2000–2002), DanceSafe, the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics, EcstasyData, Black Rock Arts Foundation, and a number of other projects.

Unexpectedly, he died of pneumonia in San Rafael, California at the age of 53. On hearing of Wallace&#x27;s death, Paul Allen was quoted as saying, &quot;I remember Bob as a gentle soul who was soft-spoken, but creative, persistent and meticulous in his programming and thinking.&quot;

==Northwest Computer Society==
The March 1976 issues of &quot;Byte&quot; magazine had a notice about a new computer club in Seattle. Bob Wallace was listed as a contact person. The Northwest Computer Club held meetings at the Pacific Science Center (near Seattle&#x27;s Space Needle.)

Bob wrote a column for the newsletter called &quot;Bob&#x27;s Bits&quot;. From the February 1978 column:

&quot;Microsoft is hiring systems programmer to work on APL, BASIC, COBOL, and FORTRAN for the 8080, Z-80, 6502, and 8086 as well as operating systems and other interesting projects. Applicants should have at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a year of assembly language experience. Contact Paul Allen at (505) 262-1486, or write to them at 300 San Mateo NE, Albuquerque, NM 87108. Microsoft is the leader in microcomputer systems programming. I&#x27;ve applied myself, by the way.&quot;

One of Bob&#x27;s club projects was to hold a Personal Computer Fair at the Pacific Science Center. The April 1978 show drew over 5000 people and had over 60 computers on display for visitors to use. Shortly after that show, Bob finished his degree and joined Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Fair was repeated in March 1979 and drew over 6000 people.

<doc id="341545" wikidata="Q3112" url="?curid=341545" title="Phil Hill">
<text>Philip Toll Hill Jr. (April 20, 1927 – August 28, 2008) was an American racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Hill won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and won three Grands Prix across eight seasons. In endurance racing, Hill was a three-time winner of both the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 12 Hours of Sebring, all with Ferrari. Upon winning the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1964 with NART, Hill became the first driver to complete the Triple Crown of endurance racing.

He was one of two American drivers to win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship alongside Mario Andretti, and the only one who was born in the United States. Hill was described as a &quot;thoughtful, gentle man&quot; and once said, &quot;I&#x27;m in the wrong business. I don&#x27;t want to beat anybody, I don&#x27;t want to be the big hero. I&#x27;m a peace-loving man, basically.&quot;

==Career==
Born April 20, 1927, in Miami, Florida, Hill was raised in Santa Monica, California, where he lived until his death. He studied business administration at the University of Southern California from 1945 to 1947, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He left early to pursue auto racing, working as a mechanic on other drivers&#x27; cars. He began racing cars at an early age, going to England as a Jaguar trainee in 1949 and signing with Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s team in 1956. He made his debut in the French Grand Prix at Reims, France, in 1958 driving a Maserati. That same year, paired with Belgian teammate Olivier Gendebien, Hill became the first American-born winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Hill driving most of the night in horrific rainy conditions. He and Gendebien would go on to win the endurance race again in 1961 and 1962.
Hill began driving full-time for the Ferrari Formula One team in 1959, earning three podium finishes and fourth place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. In 1960 he won the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, the first Grand Prix win for an American driver in nearly forty years (except the Indianapolis 500, once part of Grand Prix World Championship series), since Jimmy Murphy won the 1921 French Grand Prix. This also turned out to be the last win for a front-engined car in Formula 1. The following season, Hill won the Belgian Grand Prix and with two races left trailed only his Ferrari teammate Wolfgang von Trips in the season standings. A crash during the Italian Grand Prix killed von Trips and fifteen spectators. Hill won the race and clinched the championship but the triumph was bittersweet. Ferrari&#x27;s decision not to travel to America for the season&#x27;s final round deprived Hill of the opportunity to participate in his home race at Watkins Glen as the newly crowned World Champion. When he returned for the following season, his last with Ferrari, Hill said, &quot;I no longer have as much need to race, to win. I don&#x27;t have as much hunger anymore. I am no longer willing to risk killing myself.&quot;
After leaving Ferrari at the end of 1962, he and fellow driver Giancarlo Baghetti started for the new team ATS created by ex-Ferrari engineers in the great walkout of 1961. In 1964 Hill continued in Formula One, driving for the Cooper Formula One Team before retiring from single-seaters at the end of the season and limiting his future driving to sports car racing with Ford Motor Company and the Chaparral Cars of Jim Hall. During the 1966 Formula One season, Hill often participated in race weekends behind the wheel of a Ford GT40 prototype, accompanied by a remote-control Panasonic camera in order to produce images for the movie &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. In that same season, he entered his last Formula One race, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, racing for Dan Gurney&#x27;s All American Racers, but he failed to qualify. Hill retired from racing altogether in 1967.

Hill has the distinction of having won the first (a three-lap event at Carrell Speedway in a MG TC on July 24, 1949) and last races of his driving career, the final victory driving for Chaparral in the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch in England in 1967. Hill also drove an experimental MG, , at Bonneville Salt Flats. The &quot;Roaring Raindrop&quot; had a 91-cubic-inch (1.5 L) supercharged MGA twin cam engine, using 86% methanol with nitrobenzene, acetone, and diethyl ether, for an output of 290 HP. In 1959 Hill attained 257 mph in this car, breaking the previous record of Stirling Moss in the same car, 246 mph. Hill appeared as himself on the December 11, 1961, episode of the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He received none of four possible votes.

==After racing==
Following his retirement, Hill built up an award-winning classic car restoration business in the 1970s called Hill &amp; Vaughn with business partner Ken Vaughn, until they sold the partnership to Jordanian Raja Gargour and Vaughn went on to run a separate business on his own in 1984. He remained with Gargour at Hill &amp; Vaughn until the sale of the business again in 1995. He also worked as a television commentator for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;.

Hill had a long association with &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine. He wrote several articles for them, including road tests and retrospective articles on historic cars and races. He shared his &quot;grand old man&quot; status at R&amp;T with 1960s racing rival Paul Frère, who also died in 2008. In his last years, He devoted his time to his vintage car collection and judged at the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance more often than any other individual; 2007 was the 40th time he had judged the event. Hill was married to Alma, and had three children: Derek, Vanessa and Jennifer. Derek raced in International Formula 3000 in 2001, 2002 and 2003, but was forced to retire when Phil became ill with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

After traveling to the Monterey Historic Automobile Races in August 2008, Hill was taken to Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey, California, where he died after a short illness from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on August 28. &quot;Inside Track&quot;, a three-volume book set came out at the tail end of 2017 covering the life and career of Phil Hill. It&#x27;s a work that had started before his death. Turn 9 of the CW13 configuration of Buttonwillow Raceway Park is named after Hill.

<doc id="341549" wikidata="Q2303897" url="?curid=341549" title="The Cooper Temple Clause">
<text>The Cooper Temple Clause were an English alternative rock band, formed in Wokingham, Berkshire in 1998. The band released three albums before announcing their split on 24 April 2007, following the departure of Daniel Fisher.

After signing a record deal with the RCA label in 2000 and putting out several singles and EPs, their debut album, &quot;See This Through and Leave&quot;, was released in 2002 to critical acclaim. 2003&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Kick Up the Fire, and Let the Flames Break Loose&quot;, achieved the band international recognition on the strength of the singles &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; and &quot;Blind Pilots&quot;. The Cooper Temple Clause left RCA in 2006, signing to Sanctuary Records for the release of their third album, &quot;Make This Your Own&quot;.

The band were named after the Cowper-Temple clause, the first part of the name of which is pronounced as in the band&#x27;s name. The clause was inserted into the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75) (it became Section 14 of the Act), and was a compromise on the nature of religious education in the state elementary schools set up in England and Wales by the Act. It was named after its proposer, Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) William Cowper-Temple (born William Francis Cowper, later Baron Mount Temple).

During many of their early interviews, the band would make up various stories related to the origin of their name. An example of this can be seen in a video interview by Supersweet TV.

==History==
===&quot;See This Through And Leave&quot; (2002)===
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;See This Through and Leave&quot;, was released on 11 February 2002. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Music&quot;, the double-A side &quot;Film-Maker // Been Training Dogs&quot;, and &quot;Who Needs Enemies?&quot;. The album was released on CD, limited edition double CD, international CD and a 7&quot; boxed set, along with 2 promo CDs. The limited edition double CD contained 3 extra songs and live versions of &quot;Panzer Attack&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Music&quot;. It was well received by critics and reached number 27 in the UK Albums Chart. Fisher wrote the lyrics for this first album.

===&quot;Kick Up the Fire, and Let the Flames Break Loose&quot; (2003)===
Nineteen months after &quot;See This Through And Leave&quot;, The Cooper Temple Clause released their second album, &quot;Kick Up the Fire, and Let the Flames Break Loose&quot;, on 8 September 2003. The album, which saw the band record for the first time at their own studios Bleak House, had a different style and increasingly incorporated electronic sounds into tracks. Its two singles, &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; and &quot;Blind Pilots&quot;, achieved the band international recognition, with &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was hailed by fans and critics alike and reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart, the highest position the band would ever achieve.

=== Didz Hammond&#x27;s departure and &quot;Make This Your Own&quot; (2005–2007) ===
In September 2005, bassist Didz Hammond left the band to join ex-Libertine Carl Barât in the band Dirty Pretty Things. The Cooper Temple Clause issued a statement on their official website confirming Didz&#x27;s departure. However, Hammond is credited as playing bass on two of &quot;Make This Your Own&quot;″s eleven tracks: &quot;Damage&quot; and &quot;What Have You Gone And Done&quot;.

After many setbacks including a change in record label, and the loss of Didz Hammond, the band&#x27;s third album was significantly delayed. It was finally released on 22 January 2007 and entitled &quot;Make This Your Own&quot;. It included the singles &quot;Damage&quot;, &quot;Homo Sapiens&quot;, &quot;Waiting Game&quot; and &quot;Head&quot;. The album saw Fisher and Bellamy having a greater role in vocals, and featured fewer electronic influences than the previous album.

=== The split and post-split work (2007–present) ===
The band announced they had split up in late April 2007, following Fisher&#x27;s decision to leave. The band had been due to headline the AKG Unsigned Heroes gig at London&#x27;s KOKO in Camden later in the same week. During the week prior to the official split, the band had been scheduled to perform at Underworld and Dingwalls as part of the Camden Crawl. These two appearances were cancelled, however, with the band citing exhaustion as the reason. It is not clear whether the split was also a factor in the cancellations. A post was made on the band&#x27;s website announcing the split.

Tom Bellamy is currently a member of Losers and the live drummer for White Belt Yellow Tag. Daniel Fisher is currently the lead singer, songwriter and guitarist in Red Kite; their debut album, &quot;Songs For Crow&quot;, was released in November 2013. Ben Gautrey is currently lead singer and guitarist in Type Two Error with Kieran Mahon playing bass and synths. In January 2023, the band announced on Instagram that they were working on their first album. Mahon completed an undergraduate degree at Queen Mary, University of London, and is currently completing an architectural history MA at University College London. Jon Harper became a session drummer in the Brazilian band Cansei de Ser Sexy (CSS) when Adriano Cintra took the place of Iracema Trevisan as bassist, after she left in March 2008. In November 2009 Harper joined the Chris Corner (ex–Sneaker Pimps) project IAMX as a member of the live band for a session that lasted until July 2010. Harper is also a tutor and lecturer at the Bristol Institute of Modern Music.
