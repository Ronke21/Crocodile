<text>The Baltimore Convention Center is a convention and exhibition hall located in downtown Baltimore, Maryland. The center is a municipal building owned and operated by the City of Baltimore.

The facility was constructed in two separate phases: the original center, with of exhibition and meeting space, opened in August 1979 at a cost of $51.4 million. A $151 million expansion, which increased the center&#x27;s total size to was completed in April 1997. The 752-room, city-owned Hilton Baltimore hotel opened in August 2008, connected to the convention center by an enclosed skywalk bridge.

In March 2016, the State of Maryland announced it was going to explore expanding the Baltimore Convention Center for an estimated cost of $600 million and build a new hotel attached to the expansion. As of August 2016, the proposal also included building a new arena. On February 4, 2020, it was reported by the Baltimore Business Journal that the proposed expansion will not occur as a revised cost estimate for just expanding the convention center is more than $1.5 billion so the proposal has been scaled back significantly to only modernize the convention center, not expand it as previously proposed.

As of 2024, an expansion for the Baltimore Convention Center is back on the table and a state-level task force was formed to study the Baltimore Convention Center and the tourism industry of Baltimore City and a final report was released which made three recommendations with regards to the future of the Baltimore Convention Center and the city&#x27;s tourism industry. (See the Future subsection &quot;Baltimore Convention Center Modernization and Expansion Project (2024-Present.)&quot; for more information on this current effort.)

==History==
As was the case with Harborplace, which opened in 1980; the Maryland Science Center, which opened in 1976; and the National Aquarium in Baltimore, which opened in 1981, the Convention Center was intended to be a catalyst for tourism, an important part of the city&#x27;s post-manufacturing economic development plans. An Abell Foundation report in June 2005 describes the Convention Center as having been &quot;built as an economic development tool to attract to Baltimore conventions, trade shows, and meetings that would leave in the city millions of dollars spent on lodging, food, entertainment, and other services.&quot; (Controversy, 2005, p. 3) A report on economic development in the area, entitled &quot;Subsidizing the Low Road: Economic Development in Baltimore&quot;, states that &quot;public and non-profit facilities such as the Maryland Science Center, the World Trade Center, the Convention Center, and the National Aquarium&quot; (&quot;Subsidizing&quot;, 2002, p. 11) were part of then-mayor Schaefer&#x27;s &quot;focus on real estate, retailing and tourism sectors&quot; (p. 10), as areas for growth, as well as his utilization of &quot;&#x27;public/private partnerships&#x27; to pursue economic development&quot; (p. 11).

During the next two decades, due in part to the success of the Convention Center and the other attractions, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards, M&amp;T Bank Stadium, Power Plant Live!, and the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African-American History, have joined the area, creating a ten-block plus entertainment and cultural destination at Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor, further increasing tourist dollars flowing into the region.

A June 2005 Greater Baltimore Committee report on tourism in Baltimore illustrates the importance of tourism in the current Baltimore region&#x27;s economy:
Hospitality and tourism and the convention industry are vital components of the region&#x27;s economy. According to the Baltimore Area Convention and Visitors Association (BACVA), spending from domestic travelers in 2002 was $8.476 billion statewide; $2.8 billion in Baltimore alone. This spending supported $719 million in state and local taxes while providing over 44,000 regional jobs. (Voices, 2005)

One major convention held in the convention center was Otakon, a convention that focuses on anime and other facets of East Asian culture. The convention had resided in the Baltimore Convention Center between 1999 and 2016. In 2013, the convention attracted 34,211 people. However, organizers of that convention announced at the close of the 2013 event plans to move to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C., for at least five years starting in 2017. Convention officials cited space concerns, along with the uncertainty of construction plans for the convention center and a new arena. According to WBAL-TV, Baltimore&#x27;s local NBC news affiliate, due to the pending departure of Otakon in 2017 to Washington, D.C., concerns were mounting regarding Baltimore&#x27;s economic future when it came to tourism. In 2016, Otakon&#x27;s final year in Baltimore, 29,113 people attended, a decline from its peak attendance of 34,211 in 2013.

The Convention Center is also viewed as important to the recent development on Baltimore&#x27;s West Side. According to Ronald M. Kreitner, executive director of West Side Renaissance Inc., the &quot;Convention Center will help contribute to the success of the theaters and the retail,&quot; referring to the development of the France-Merrick Performing Arts Center/Hippodrome Theatre, as well as new retail ventures in the area. (Renaissance, 2003)

By 2013, the center was playing a major role in the city&#x27;s tourism growth, with conventions, seminars, conferences and exhibitions helping boost visitor numbers that year to 23.9 million, and expenditure by visitors to $5.15 billion. Visit Baltimore President Tom Noonan noted in July 2014 Baltimore was leading other cities in terms of future convention center bookings, through until 2021.

In early 2017, a &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; article revealed that Otakon wasn&#x27;t the only large convention that Baltimore City lost due to the current size of the Baltimore Convention Center. The article reports that as of the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2016, Visit Baltimore hosted 415 total event with a combined estimated economic impact of $180 million, the city usually hosts 20 to 30 large conventions annually however city officials are now stating the convention center is too small to be competitive with other cities. The article also reports that at least 10 large conventions have left Baltimore due to outgrowing the convention center and these conventions were held at the convention center during the previous 10 years and the total of 10 large conventions includes Otakon which as of 2017 will be held at the much larger Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. The article also reports that future conventions are at risk of leaving Baltimore as well.

==Future==
Despite the continuing growth and redevelopment in the area, the expanded Convention Center has not met expectations with respect to the number of conventions and people it attracts each year. Irene E. Van Sant, then-manager of the Convention Center Hotel Project for the Baltimore Development Corporation, Baltimore&#x27;s former Mayor Sheila Dixon, and Governor of Maryland Martin O&#x27;Malley—feel that a hotel adjacent to the Convention Center will make it a more appealing site for conventions. The completion of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C., and the National Harbor project in Prince George&#x27;s County intensified the debate.

In general, supporters of a convention hotel say that for the Convention Center to be viable in the future, and compete with other cities for conventions, a new &quot;Headquarters&quot; hotel is necessary to guarantee enough rooms for group meetings. Opponents of the hotel project have either questioned the necessity of a new hotel altogether or objected to the use of public dollars to finance the project. The Baltimore Convention Center hotel, named Hilton Baltimore, broke ground in February 2006 and opened in August 2008. It has 752 rooms and is the city&#x27;s largest hotel, connected directly to the Convention Center via sky bridge. Baltimore City used public revenue bonds to cover the $301.7 million cost of building the hotel.

===First proposed arena-hotel-convention center project (2010–2016)===
When the 1996 expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center opened, the convention center was ranked 28th largest in the nation in terms of exhibition and meeting space. By 2011, the convention center plummeted to 73rd largest and, as a result, Baltimore is losing convention business. Visit Baltimore reports that the Hilton Baltimore Convention Center Hotel that opened in August 2008 is helping, but since the opening of the Hilton the city has lost over 700,000 hotel-night bookings due to the convention center being too small to meet the needs of a group or the dates the group wanted was not available.

It has been argued that if Baltimore does not expand its convention center, the city could &quot;fall off the map as a potential convention choice.&quot; Nearby cities have or are in the process of expanding convention and hotel space, such as Washington D.C. (opened the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in 2003 with plans to open a 1,175-room Marriott Marquis hotel with of convention and meeting space in 2013) and Philadelphia (expanded its Pennsylvania Convention Center in 2011 of over of meeting and convention space).

Visit Baltimore proposes an expansion of the convention center, reasoning that it would allow the city to accommodate multiple large meetings or conventions at a time. Additionally, the Greater Baltimore Committee estimates that with the proposed arena-hotel-convention center, Baltimore could accommodate as many as 300 new convention groups that cannot utilize Baltimore currently due to the size of the convention center.

In fall 2010, the Greater Baltimore Committee, a local influential business group, proposed an estimated $900 million project that would demolish the 1979 wing of the Baltimore Convention Center east of Sharp Street, plus the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel on the same block, and replace the buildings with a four-story, convention center expansion, an 18,500-seat arena that will replace Baltimore&#x27;s existing 1st Mariner Arena over two levels of underground parking, a new 500-room Sheraton hotel and stores and restaurants facing Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. At the time, the $900 million price tag was the only obstacle with the proposal.

However, on May 25, 2011, at the annual meeting for the Greater Baltimore Committee, the owner of the Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel, local business and construction magnate, Willard Hackerman, made an offer that he would be willing to finance more than half of the proposed $900 million price tag and would be willing to build the hotel and the arena which is estimated to cost $500 million and the remainder, $400 million for the convention center expansion would need to be financed by the State of Maryland and Baltimore City, the offer is contingent on whether the city and state can move the convention center expansion project forward. The offer received a positive reception from both Baltimore City Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Maryland Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley who both have submitted requests to the Maryland Stadium Authority to conduct a feasibility study on the project that is due by the end of 2011.

Visit Baltimore, the architects involved and others have said that this project is unique in that no other cities in the nation would have a combination arena-hotel-convention center the size of the proposed project in Baltimore.

On June 2, 2011, the Baltimore Sun reported that Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley wanted the Maryland Stadium Authority to pay for the estimated $150,000 feasibility study that will determine the &quot;estimate of taxes that the project would generate&quot; and if the study found the project to be viable, O&#x27;Malley and Rawlings-Blake wanted &quot;an analysis of potential financing options and a strategy for moving the work forward.&quot; On June 14, 2011, the MSA unanimously approved the feasibility request with a 7–0 vote; however, the MSA wanted the city of Baltimore to pay for part of the $150,000 cost for the feasibility study.

On July 18, 2011, the Baltimore Sun reported that the Baltimore Convention &amp; Tourism Board approved to take $50,000 out of Visit Baltimore&#x27;s budget to pay for the $150,000 feasibility study that the Maryland Stadium Authority approved on June 14, 2011.

As of October 10, 2011, the Maryland Stadium Authority had posted on its website the feasibility study that was approved on June 14, 2011. The project is expected to include &quot;a market and economic study of the convention center expansion and incremental tax benefits for all three venues, and a funding strategy.&quot; According to the MSA page, &quot;The study is expected to be complete by winter [2011–2012].&quot;

On March 5, 2012, the feasibility report was published and made public jointly by the Maryland Stadium Authority and Baltimore City which strongly makes the recommendation for expanding the Baltimore Convention Center and replacing 1st Mariner Arena, reiterating that Baltimore&#x27;s tourism industry will be harmed in the long run if no action is taken. Also, on April 11, 2012, the Baltimore Business Journal published an article stating that the Maryland General Assembly in approved $2.5 million for the convention center project allocated for &quot;initial design [of the] $400 million expansion of the convention center (slated to be funded using public money from the State of Maryland and the City of Baltimore), as well as a $500 million, 18,500-seat arena and hotel project (slated to be funded using private funding from a group led by local business magnate Willard Hackerman)&quot; however the Maryland General Assembly&#x27;s budget committees added a prerequisite before they will approve the release of the $2.5 million. The prerequisite required that the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore and the private financiers of the project submit a memorandum of understanding to the Maryland General Assembly&#x27;s budget committees with a detailed explanation of how this project would be funded, how much of the $400 million would be shared between the State of Maryland and the City of Baltimore and exactly who would operate the new arena. The proponent of this project and CEO of the Greater Baltimore Committee, Donald Fry, stated in an interview with the Baltimore Business Journal that the approval of initial design funds by the Maryland General Assembly gives the green light to both the Greater Baltimore Committee and Willard Hackerman to enter into serious negotiations with private investors regarding &quot;naming rights or concession agreements for the arena&quot; and he feels that this is a good sign that the Maryland General Assembly will, in fact, provide even more state funding towards this project in the future.

On October 22, 2012, Tom Noonan, President and CEO of Visit Baltimore, voiced his support of this proposal. A series of studies would need to be conducted by the Maryland Stadium Authority to activate the $2.5 million and determine the feasibility and costs of the project. Construction, however, is not expected to begin until at least 2016.

In the Summer of 2013, the Greater Baltimore Committee proposal to build an expanded Baltimore Convention Center and a new arena came up in the Baltimore media due to the announcement that the largest event for Baltimore City, Otakon, would be departing Baltimore in 2017 to Washington, D.C., due to the convention quickly running out of room at the Baltimore Convention Center. According to The Baltimore Sun on August 11, 2013, the proposal &quot;was not close to becoming a reality&quot; and that according to GBC&#x27;s spokesman Gene Bracken, financing for the proposal &quot;hasn&#x27;t been worked out at all.&quot; On August 16, 2013, The Baltimore Sun reported that little progress has been made on the Greater Baltimore Committee&#x27;s proposal, reporting that since April 2012, city and state officials have been negotiating with Willard Hackerman regarding exactly how to pay for the total $900 million projected amount for the proposal and that if the city, state and Mr. Hackerman can come up with a funding plan, the state will release $2.5 million &quot;to pay for an expanded study of the project.&quot; The Baltimore Sun in the same article reported that the uncertainty surrounding the proposal to expand the Baltimore Convention Center &quot;played a part in Otakon&#x27;s departure&quot; where Visit Baltimore &quot;warned&quot; a bid evaluating team for future Otakons &quot;that construction could affect those events&quot; however Visit Baltimore&#x27;s CEO, Tom Noonan told The Baltimore Sun that &quot;there&#x27;s no set plan and that we&#x27;re not near that point&quot; in regards to potential construction and that a future study &quot;will be to figure out how&quot; the Baltimore Convention Center will &quot;operate during construction.&quot; On August 12, 2013 WBAL reported that Donald Fry of the Greater Baltimore Committee told WBAL that he hoped that the GBC would be able to &quot;present the mayor with some sort of financial concept within the next 30 to 60 days.&quot;

On February 10, 2014, the Greater Baltimore Committee proposal to build an expanded convention Center and new arena hit a major roadblock: the owner of the Sheraton Inner Harbor and the person who was spearheading the efforts to raise private funds for the project, Willard Hackerman died. The Baltimore Business Journal reported on February 11, 2014, that the death of Willard Hackerman the day prior has thrown the future of the proposal into question. Kaliope Parthemos, Baltimore City&#x27;s then-Deputy Mayor of Economic and Neighborhood Development told the Baltimore Business Journal that the City of Baltimore was in active discussions with Mr. Hackerman about the proposal up until December 2013 and stated that Mr. Hackerman was actively involved and wanted this proposal to move forward however he was &quot;frustrated&quot; that he could not have privately funded the entire cost by himself. Ms. Parthemos revealed that financing the estimated $900 million project &quot;remained a significant hurdle up until Hackerman&#x27;s death.&quot; Ms. Parthemos also stated that she was uncertain whether Mr. Hackerman made any plans to have the project continue after his death in case if he died.

As of November 27, 2015, no new news has been released regarding the uncertain future of the Greater Baltimore Committee proposal. It&#x27;s currently unknown if the proposal will have political support after Martin O&#x27;Malley stepped down as Governor of Maryland due to term limits and Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced she would not be seeking reelection as Baltimore Mayor.

As of March 8, 2016, this proposal is dead and not expected to be revived because the Rawlings-Blake administration is looking into renovating Royal Farms Arena instead of building a new arena. The State of Maryland has begun exploring the possibility of a $600 million expansion (see below).

===Proposed $600 million Baltimore Convention Center Expansion and New Hotel (2016)===
On March 8, 2016, it was revealed by the Baltimore Business Journal that the State of Maryland is exploring constructing a $600 million expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center that would double the existing floor space of the convention center and build a new hotel as well.

State officials are going to request in Spring 2016 from Governor Larry Hogan and the Maryland General Assembly $3 million in seed money to launch a study for expanding the convention center. This study will allow engineers and architects to figure out where to place the expansion.

Maryland&#x27;s Commerce Secretary, Mike Gill said that the CEO of Visit Baltimore recently met with the Maryland Department of Commerce to request seed money to study the expansion of the convention center.

One possible location is demolishing the existing Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel and locating the expansion there and building the new hotel at the southwest corner of Pratt and Charles.

All of this is part of an ongoing discussion about expanding the Baltimore Convention Center which has been a focus of the current 2016 legislative session within the Maryland General Assembly.

This new proposal by the State of Maryland and the focus of expanding the Baltimore Convention Center within the Maryland General Assembly comes about in the final year [2016] that Baltimore&#x27;s largest convention, Otakon, will be held in Baltimore. In 2017, Otakon will no longer be held in Baltimore and is relocating to Washington, D.C., at the larger Walter E. Washington Convention Center.

As of 12:00 AM EDT, April 12, 2016, the official end of the 2016 Maryland legislative session within the Maryland General Assembly, no bill was introduced in either the state Senate or House of Delegates that requested the $3 million in seed money to launch a study for expanding the Baltimore Convention Center. It&#x27;s currently unknown why no bill was introduced in the 2016 legislative session when it was reported in March 2016 that there would be a request for $3 million, it&#x27;s unknown if the request will be made within the 2017 Maryland legislative session that will begin on Wednesday, January 11, 2017, at 12:00 PM EST.

On Thursday, April 14, 2016, the &quot;Baltimore Business Journal&quot; reported that the $3 million for a study to expand the Baltimore Convention Center was supposed to be part of one of three supplemental budgets that the Maryland Governor has but according to Karen Glen Hood, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Commerce told the Baltimore Business Journal that a formal request for $3 million was never submitted to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and did not explain why the request was not made, instead deferring the question of why to local officials closer to the Baltimore Convention Center.

Visit Baltimore CEO Tom Noonan, a longtime advocate for expanding the Baltimore Convention Center stated he was &quot;disappointed&quot; that the funding wasn&#x27;t in place at the end of the 2016 Maryland legislative session, the executive director of the convention center, Peggy Daidakis could not have been reached for comment.

Maryland&#x27;s Secretary of Commerce, Mike Gill, told the Baltimore Business Journal that the interested parties in having the Baltimore Convention Center expanded are having &quot;ongoing conversations&quot; into what the next steps for a study would be but stated he couldn&#x27;t state specifics.

Visit Baltimore&#x27;s CEO Noonan revealed that at least 30% of interested citywide conventions, conventions defined as requiring at least 1,200 hotel rooms at its peak night, skip over Baltimore for other cities due to the convention center being either too small or is already booked on the dates the interested conventions want reserved in Baltimore.

The Baltimore Business Journal reports that when the Baltimore Convention Center opened in 1979, it was &quot;one of the premier convention spaces in the country&quot; but the stature of the convention center has fallen over time with upgrades to other convention centers in cities such as Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.

Now, as of April 14, 2016, the interested parties for an expanded convention center will either have to wait until 2017&#x27;s legislative session or search for alternative funding.

As of August 2, 2016, the proposed project of constructing an expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel has been revived and a $1 million feasibility study has in fact been approved (see below).

===Second proposed arena-hotel-convention center project (2016–2017)===
On August 2, 2016, it&#x27;s been revealed that the proposed project of constructing a combined expanded convention center attached to an arena and hotel has been revived and that a $1 million feasibility study for a combined arena, hotel and expanded convention center was requested by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake from the Maryland Stadium Authority and that the Maryland Stadium Authority has approved the study. Funding is coming from the Maryland Stadium Authority ($126,667), the State of Maryland (an additional $500,000 is available immediately to fund this study), the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore ($30,000), the Greater Baltimore Committee ($30,000), and the City of Baltimore ($313,333). The study will take approximately a year to complete and is expected to be completed and released in Fall 2017. The study will look at having either just a convention center expansion and having a combined expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel, the study will look at the environmental, community and traffic impacts of the two proposals and what types of events the new facility will be able to attract, this study will also determine exactly how large the expanded convention center is supposed to be. The new complex will be bounded by Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. This study will not include construction and budget plans as this is just Phase 1, if the state and city elects to move forward after reviewing the results of this study, that second study will put together just partial plans to obtain a cost estimate.

In November 2016, the Maryland Stadium Authority&#x27;s feasibility study that was approved in August 2016 got full funding after the Baltimore City Board of Estimates approved to commit to $313,000 of funding towards the $1 million feasibility study. This comes approximately a week after the Baltimore Development Corp., the city&#x27;s economic development agency&#x27;s board approved to commit to $250,000 of funding towards the $1 million feasibility study (the remainder of the study costs are being funded through the state and two private groups: $126,667 from the Maryland Stadium Authority, $500,000 from the Maryland Department of Commerce with a total of $626,667 coming from the State of Maryland and $30,000 each from local groups the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore and the Greater Baltimore Committee). Jeff Pilas, the CFO of the Baltimore Development Corp. told the Baltimore Business Journal that if the study recommends an expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center, a second phase for the study would commence involving design. The study was requested by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and is expected to begin sometime in early 2017 and final completion is expected to be sometime later in 2017.

In April 2017, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, the successor to former Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, stated that she does not agree with building a hotel as part of an expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center.

On May 4, 2017, the Baltimore Sun has reported that Phase 1 of the Baltimore Convention Center expansion feasibility study is moving along. On May 3, 2017, the Maryland Stadium Authority approved a team for the study that includes Baltimore design firm Ayers Saint Gross, Seattle architectural firm LMN Architects, Kansas City firm Populous, and New York design firm Perkins Eastman. The Baltimore Sun reports that the study amount has significantly decreased from the amount being &quot;up to $1 million&quot; to now the study total costs is &quot;not to exceed $460,000.&quot; The study is to &quot;assess what combination of elements is feasible—a convention center expansion, hotel and new venue to replace Royal Farms Arena—and how they might fit together.&quot; and is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. Funding for the $460,000 is still coming from public and private sources including Baltimore City and the State of Maryland. Based upon the final recommendations of this study, the Baltimore Sun reports that a Phase 2 study &quot;may be authorized later.&quot;

As of September 2017, Phase 1 of the Baltimore Convention Center expansion study is underway. According to an LMN Architects press release, the study will be examining 4 &quot;alternative development options&quot;:
* An expanded and renovated Baltimore Convention Center without a hotel and new arena
* An expanded and renovated Baltimore Convention Center that incorporates only a new arena.
* An expanded and renovated Baltimore Convention Center that incorporates only a hotel.
* An expanded and renovated Baltimore Convention Center that incorporates both a hotel and a new arena.
The Baltimore Business Journal reported that the amount allocated to Phase 1 is indeed $1 million and a recommendation from this study is expected by the end of 2017.

The official study summary according to the Maryland Stadium Authority is:MSA&#x27;s Board has approved a request by the Mayor of Baltimore to conduct various program and construction related analysis to determine the program and technical feasibility for a proposed Baltimore Convention Center expansion. The Study will consider both a stand-alone convention center as well as a hybrid facility inclusive of a hotel and/or arena.Funding is being provided by a mix of public, private, City and State dollars.The MSA also lists the budget to be $1 million.

As of February 26, 2018, the Phase 1 feasibility study has not been released publicly yet nor has a study recommendation been released publicly, both were reported to be released by the end of 2017 and it&#x27;s unknown what is causing the delay for releasing the Phase 1 study or the study recommendation.

=== Baltimore Convention Center Expansion/Renovation and Second Convention Center Hotel Project (2018-2020) ===
On July 6, 2018, Phase 1 of a feasibility study to examine the feasibility of expanding and renovating the Baltimore Convention Center along with a new convention center hotel and arena was released in three parts by the Maryland Stadium Authority. Phase 1 came to the ultimate conclusion that an expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center is financially and operationally feasible. The proposed scenario for the expansion is to demolish the 1979 half of the convention center located at the corner of West Pratt and South Charles Streets and demolish the Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel at the 300 block of South Charles Street and use that space to build an expansion connected to a second convention center hotel and also to fully renovate the 1996 half. An arena was determined to have &quot;significant operational and construction challenges&quot; so the arena is no longer a part of the project. The Mayor of Baltimore City, Catherine Pugh, requested in July 2018 that the Maryland Stadium Authority begin Phase 2 of the feasibility study. The MSA begun Phase 2 in Fall 2018 and is expected to be completed by Spring 2019. In the 2019 legislative session, the Maryland Senate introduced Senate Bill 799 and the Maryland House of Delegates has introduced a corresponding bill, House Bill 801 which would provide financing towards the construction of the project, $600 million total has been allocated towards the project in SB 799 and HB 801.

As of the end of the 2019 Maryland General Assembly legislative session, Maryland House Bill 801 passed both chambers and was enacted into law without Hogan&#x27;s signature. The final law that was enacted as Chapter 695 removed the proposed $600 million allocated for construction of the expansion and renovation, it changed the defined boundaries of the convention center site to include the Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel and the adjacent parking garage located next to the hotel and the law requires that planning and design to begin during Fiscal Year 2020 which starts July 1, 2019, and that financing for the planning and design stage to be split between the state (2/3 of the final cost) and the City of Baltimore (remaining 1/3 of the final cost).

As of June 16, 2019, Phase 2 of the feasibility study has not been publicly released, the public release is unknown at the current time.

On February 4, 2020, the Baltimore Business Journal has reported that a revised cost estimate was released for just expanding the convention center and it is much more than the previously reported estimate of $600 million. The revised cost estimate is &quot;more than $1.5 billion,&quot; according to the Maryland Stadium Authority, the revised cost estimate included land acquisition of the Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel and related infrastructure work of expanding the convention center and relocating infrastructure located in the southbound lane of Charles Street. As a result, the proposal is going to be scaled back significantly and an expansion is no longer being proposed.

=== Baltimore Convention Center Modernization Project (2020) ===

On February 4, 2020, the Baltimore Business Journal has reported that the Baltimore Convention Center will be &quot;modernized&quot; and not expanded due to a revised cost estimate of &quot;more than $1.5 billion&quot; to expand the convention center.

In March 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Larry Hogan announced that the Convention Center would be turned into an alternate care site to deal with an expected surge of patients. It was later used as a testing and vaccination site. The facility was run jointly by Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of Maryland Hospital.

=== Baltimore Convention Center Proposed Modernization and Expansion Project (2024-Present) ===
In early 2024, the Maryland General Assembly passed a bill (Maryland 2024 Legislative Session - Senate Bill 896) to create the Baltimore Convention and Tourism Redevelopment and Operating Authority Task Force under the Maryland Department of Commerce. The task force began on July 1, 2024 and has the stated mission of &quot;to study and publish a report with recommendations concerning the membership, purpose and function of an entity or strategy to govern the renovation, revitalization, financing, ongoing maintenance and management of the Baltimore Convention site and certain surrounding areas.&quot; This task force started holding meetings on August 8, 2024 and has had subsequent meetings on September 4, October 9 and October 29. This 22-member task force has been discussing the potential future of the Baltimore Convention Center which includes renovation and expansion of the Baltimore Convention Center. According to an October 30, 2024 Baltimore Business Journal article, the Maryland Stadium Authority provided the task force with cost estimates for the renovation and potential expansion of the Baltimore Convention Center. At the least expensive option which would only involve renovating and modernizing both the east and west sections of the building, the Maryland Stadium Authority provided the cost estimate of $740 million to $774 million. With the most expensive option which would incorporate renovations and modernization along with an expansion that would add a 100,000 SF flex-space to the existing building, the Maryland Stadium Authority provided the cost estimate of $890 million to $930 million. The article mentions that this task force &quot;is expected to provide a report with recommendations to the governor, mayor and the General Assembly this year&quot; and that the idea for this task force is for the task force &quot;to share how much renovations might cost, how the upgrades could be funded and how the convention center could be governed going forward.&quot;

On January 8, 2025, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott released his legislative priorities list for the 2025 Maryland General Assembly legislative session. Within the list, it lists that Mayor Scott wants to establish an oversight authority for the Baltimore Convention Center. This suggests that the Baltimore Convention and Tourism Redevelopment and Operating Authority Task Force has fully completed their assigned work and has released a final task force report with recommendations regarding the Baltimore Convention Center to the Mayor of Baltimore, the Baltimore City Council, the Maryland General Assembly and Governor Wes Moore as required by the bill that established the task force.

On an undetermined date, the meeting minutes for the Baltimore Convention and Tourism Redevelopment and Operating Authority Task Force meeting for October 29, 2024 was released to the public in which it reports that the previous proposal to renovate and expand the Baltimore Convention Center and add a new hotel that would be connected to the convention center was determined to be infeasible due to the estimated costs of construction which was stated to be $1.6 billion+. The Maryland Commerce Department Secretary, Kevin Anderson, inquired about what caused that determination that the cost of $1.6 billion made the proposal infeasible despite the study conducted by the MSA stated that either expanding or renovating the Baltimore Convention Center &quot;would be warranted from an economic and fiscal perspective.&quot; The &quot;primary reason&quot; given to Secretary Anderson regarding the determination that the cost made the proposal infeasible &quot;was that the planned updates were not something visitors would accept, it would not have been a great visitor experience.&quot; Another reason given &quot;was that the costs were far more than what they had conceived at that time.&quot;

On an undetermined date, the final task force report containing the recommendations regarding the Baltimore Convention Center was released to the public. This Maryland Commerce Department task force has made a total of 3 recommendations that are described as being &quot;required and integrally connected to the long-term viability of large-scale convention business in the state.&quot; (page 18). The three recommendations that have been made are: &quot;1. Governance: Establishment of a Joint Authority to govern Convention Center and Tourism Board operations, effectively merging Visit Baltimore and the Baltimore Convention Center under a new governance model. 2. Ownership and Improvements Financing: State and City partnership on Convention Center improvements such as that the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City retain ownership of the Baltimore City Convention Center, and in exchange for primarily or exclusively State-bonded improvements, the State of Maryland would receive a lienholder interest while the debt is outstanding. 3. Operational Sustainability: The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City establish a direct revenue stream to the Authority that allows the Authority to meet its annual operating and capital needs.&quot; This final report also provides detailed information on the current status of the Baltimore Convention Center and provides the same exact warnings as previous studies conducted on the Baltimore Convention Center with regards to renovating and expansion wherein if absolutely nothing is done for the Baltimore Convention Center building, Baltimore City would see a decline in both events and conventions and as a result, both Baltimore City and the State of Maryland would see a loss of money (page 10). On page 9, a quote is cited to a 2021 report from the Maryland Stadium Authority in which it states that &quot;remaining status quo will likely result in a steady decrease in event activity, particularly relative to convention, tradeshow and large meeting business,&quot; and warns that &quot;while some of these events may choose to use other facilities in the State like the Gaylord National Resort &amp; Convention Center, many will likely leave the State for other destinations such as Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Boston and Nashville. As such, a decline in event activity would also yield a decrease in operating revenue, an increase in operating loss and less economic and fiscal impacts to local and State governments.&quot; As mentioned earlier in this section, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott wants introduced in the Maryland General Assembly during its 2025 session, a bill that would fulfill the first listed recommendation within this final report.

==Location==

<text>Tu Weiming (born 1940) is a Chinese-born American philosopher. He is Chair Professor of Humanities and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Humanistic Studies at Peking University. He is also Professor Emeritus and Senior Fellow of Asia Center at Harvard University.

== Biography ==
Tu was born on February 6, 1940, in Kunming, Yunnan Province, Mainland China, and grew up in Taiwan. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree (1961) in Chinese studies from Tunghai University and learned from such Confucian scholars as Mou Zongsan, Tang Junyi, and Xu Fuguan. He earned his Master of Arts degree (1963) in regional studies (East Asia) and Doctor of Philosophy degree (1968) in history and East Asian languages from Harvard University, where he studied with professors including Benjamin I. Schwartz, Talcott Parsons, and Robert Neelly Bellah. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1988), a member of Academia Sinica (2018), an executive member of the Federation of International Philosophical Societies, and a tutelary member of the International Institute of Philosophy.

Tu was Harvard–Yenching Professor of Chinese History and Philosophy and of Confucian Studies at Harvard University and Director of the Harvard–Yenching Institute (1996–2008). He also held faculty positions at Princeton University (1968–1971) and the University of California at Berkeley (1971–1981) and was Director of the Institute of Culture and Communication at the East–West Center in Hawaii (1990–1991).

Tu was a visiting professor at Beijing Normal University, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, National Taiwan University, Peking University, and the University of Paris. He currently holds honorary professorships from the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, Jinan University, Renmin University, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Soochow University, and Zhejiang University.

In 1988, Tu was one of many public intellectuals who were asked by &quot;Life&quot; magazine to give their impressions on &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;. In 1994, he was featured in &quot;A World of Ideas with Bill Moyer: A Confucian Life in America&quot; (Films for the Humanities and Sciences). In 2001, he was appointed by Kofi Annan as a member of the United Nations&#x27; &quot;Group of Eminent Persons&quot; to facilitate the Dialogue Among Civilizations. In 2004, he gave a presentation on inter-civilizational dialogue to the executive board of UNESCO. He was also one of the eight Confucian intellectuals who were invited by the Singaporean government to develop the &quot;Confucian Ethics&quot; school curriculum.

After announcing his retirement, Roddick defeated Bernard Tomic and Fabio Fognini before his final match on September 5, 2012, where he lost to Juan Martín del Potro in four sets in the fourth round. Four days after his loss, Roddick was honored in a special ceremony in Arthur Ashe Stadium on his retirement, in which Andre Agassi participated. Due to his retirement, he ended the year at No. 39, the lowest he had been since 2000, the year he turned professional, when he only played five events.

===2015===
Roddick played one tournament on tour, the 2015 BB&amp;T Atlanta Open, where he competed in the men&#x27;s doubles event with Mardy Fish. They lost in the quarterfinals.

===2017: Hall of Fame induction===
Roddick was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame on July 22, 2017, alongside Kim Clijsters of Belgium.

==Nicknames and on-court behavior==
Roddick is often called &quot;A-Rod&quot;, a play on the nickname of New York Yankees baseball star Alex Rodriguez, referring to his first initial and the first syllable of his last name.

Roddick made frequent outbursts against umpires and linesmen on the court. At the 2001 US Open, Roddick angrily disputed a ball that landed wide at a crucial point in the fifth set of his quarter-final match against Lleyton Hewitt (he was serving at *4–5), calling umpire Jorge Dias &quot;a moron&quot; and copping a code violation for audible obscenity. During his third-round match at the Australian Open in 2008, he abused umpire Emmanuel Joseph saying, &quot;You&#x27;re an idiot! Stay in school, kids or you&#x27;ll end up being an umpire.&quot;

Roddick lost his temper again at the 2010 Australian Open after a ball that he did not play was called out on match point, but ruled to be in after a video review. He continued arguing with the umpire after the conclusion of the match but later said that he was wrong. Later again that year, he launched into a tirade at an official over a foot-fault call at the 2010 US Open, a match he eventually lost to Serbia&#x27;s Janko Tipsarević. In 2011, Roddick snapped at the chair umpire at Indian Wells on his way to lose to France&#x27;s Richard Gasquet.

In a second-round match against Philipp Kohlschreiber at the 2011 Cincinnati Masters, Roddick was given a penalty point, which resulted in a critical break of serve in favor of his opponent. The penalty point was given due to ball-abuse, when Roddick smashed a ball into the stands in frustration after he had already been warned earlier in the match by umpire Carlos Bernardes for an episode of racquet abuse. This triggered another series of altercations with the umpire, with Roddick expressing his displeasure at the umpire&#x27;s call. Roddick lost the match.

==Endorsements==
From 2000 to 2005, Roddick wore Reebok apparel. After Reebok announced it would not renew its contract with Roddick, Roddick signed a five-year, $25 million endorsement deal with Lacoste in April 2005. In November, he signed an agreement to endorse Lacoste eyewear for four years worth between $750,000 and $1 million. In 2011, Lacoste introduced the Andy Roddick collection which included polos, jackets, tennis shorts and track pants. In June 2013, Roddick became an investor and brand ambassador to TravisMathew Apparel.

In 2005, Roddick signed a multiyear worldwide endorsement deal with carmaker Lexus. His other endorsement deals include American Express, Rolex, Powerade in 2002, Parlux Fragrances, Arizona Beverage Company in 2009, Microsoft Xbox and Sega.

==Playing style==

Roddick&#x27;s serve was known for its power, usually travelling at 130–150 mph (209~242 km/h) and often unreturnable. He once held the record for fastest serve at . Roddick&#x27;s favorite shot is his off-forehand, which he used in combination with his kicker out wide. Roddick used to play his off-forehand frequently but later adjusted and used it to create points. He usually targeted the two corners to win aces. As for his second serve, he usually employed a heavy kick serve, then used a variety of spins, slices, and angles in the rally to throw off his opponent. He was noted for using heavy topspin on both his serves and his twist serve was particularly high kicking.

Roddick also occasionally used the serve-and-volley tactic on both first and second services to surprise his opponent, though he generally remained near the baseline after a serve. He later developed a more all-court playing style compared to the aggressive baseline style he played with for most of his early career. Although Roddick&#x27;s backhand was a weakness throughout his career, it improved somewhat in 2009 under Stefanki&#x27;s guidance.

==Media appearances==
On April 5, 2002, Roddick guest-starred on the television show &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; as himself. In the episode, Sabrina summoned him so he could give her tennis lessons.

Roddick appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot; in 2002 and 2003, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in 2003 and 2009, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; in 2003, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in 2004 and 2005, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; in 2005 and 2007, and &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; in 2006. Roddick also appeared on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; in 2007 and 2010.

Roddick hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 8, 2003, becoming the second professional tennis player to host (Chris Evert being the first during the show&#x27;s 15th season) and the first (and, as of September 2023, only) male tennis player to host.

Pre-Wimbledon, Roddick appeared on an episode of the British version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, which was broadcast on 18 June 2004.

Roddick was in an advertisement for &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot;, with Stuart Scott, in which he confronts the Sports Center anchor about the anchors not calling him &quot;A-Rod&quot;, and asks him &quot;Did Alex Rodriguez put you up to this?&quot; Scott replies &quot;Who?&quot; Roddick says &quot;A-Rod!&quot; Scott gets a sneaky look on his face, and Roddick leaves disgusted.

The June/July issue of &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot; magazine carried an article on Roddick. The cover shot featured the tennis ace in a T-shirt, straining to contain massive, pumped-up biceps and hulking shoulder and chest muscles. The image set off widespread online speculation that the magazine had altered Roddick&#x27;s likeness, a suspicion echoed by Roddick himself. Roddick has quipped that he saw the photo, and that &quot;Nadal wanted his arms back.&quot;

In March 2009, Roddick appeared in the &quot;Speed Feels Better&quot; music video for singer-songwriter Michael Tolcher. Other athletes in the video included Amanda Beard, Barry Sanders, Kimmie Meissner, and Rick Ankiel.

Roddick played tennis using a frying pan instead of a racquet for the book &quot;Andy Roddick Beat Me With a Frying Pan&quot; by Todd Gallagher.

In 2011, Roddick made a cameo at the end of the film &quot;Just Go With It&quot;, as the new lover of the film&#x27;s jilted bride, played by Decker.

In 2011 Roddick co-hosted a radio show for one day on &quot;Fox Sports Radio&quot; with his friend Bobby Bones on the latter&#x27;s eponymous program. Due to the success of that one-time show, Fox Sports Radio offered Roddick and Bones a nationally syndicated sports radio show. The show debuted on January 7, 2012, and could be heard nationally on Saturdays from 12 to 3 PM CST. It was a mix of sports, pop culture and entertainment. On February 16, 2012, Roddick interviewed his wife, Brooklyn, on the radio show and during that interview he first revealed his plans on retiring and turning the radio show into a daily show and into his new career.

At the 2013 AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, Roddick played his first professional golf tournament (as an amateur) where he teamed up with professional golfer, John Mallinger. Although Roddick&#x27;s team missed the cut to get the final round, he and Mallinger ended with a combined score of 16 under par (with Roddick individually hitting at a 6 handicap).

In 2013, Roddick was hired by Fox Sports 1 as co-host for the network&#x27;s flagship program Fox Sports Live.

In 2015, Roddick joined the BBC as pundit and commentator for the 2015 Wimbledon Championships.

In 2017, Roddick&#x27;s wife revealed that he discarded most of his tennis trophies except the US Open trophy.

In 2019, Roddick appeared on &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; with his wife and the rest of the Decker family, competing against Bobby Bones and his family.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Roddick tweeted Tennis Channel requesting a &quot;job.&quot; This led him to become a temporary contributor to the channel.

On April 2, 2023, Roddick participated with Michael Chang, Andre Agassi and John McEnroe in the first live airing of Pickleball on ESPN in the Million dollar Pickleball Slam at the Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Fla.

In 2024, Roddick began a weekly podcast series for Tennis Channel named &quot;Served with Andy Roddick&quot;.

==Personal life==
From 2003 to 2004, Roddick dated actress and singer Mandy Moore.

It was while Roddick was watching a show on the CNN/Sports Illustrated website called &quot;She Says Z Says&quot; that he first noticed Brooklyn Decker, to whom he is now married. According to Decker in an interview with David Letterman, Roddick had his agent contact her agent to arrange an initial meeting. The two began dating in 2007, and on March 31, 2008, Roddick announced on his website that they had become engaged. The couple were married on April 17, 2009, in Austin, Texas.

Brooklyn Decker gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child on September 30, 2015. She gave birth to their second child, a daughter, on November 27, 2017.

==Awards and records==
In 2004, Roddick produced what was then the fastest serve in professional tennis: during a Davis Cup semifinal match with Vladimir Voltchkov on hard court in Charleston, South Carolina. Roddick&#x27;s record serve has since been superseded by Ivo Karlović, who served at playing at the Davis Cup in March 2011. Roddick also had the fastest serve in U.S. Open history: against American Scoville Jenkins, and against future No. 1 Rafael Nadal. Roddick also won the 2004 ESPY Award for Best Male Tennis Player.

That same year he won the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award of the Year because of his charity efforts, which included: raising money for the survivors of the tsunami following 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake through Serving for Tsunami Relief and other efforts; auctioning off several rackets and autographs to raise money for UNICEF; and creating the Andy Roddick Foundation to help at-risk youth.

In 2007, Roddick and the Andy Roddick Foundation were awarded by the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health. Roddick was the first male tennis player ever to receive the award.

<text>Pavel Stepanovich Nakhimov (, ; – ) was a Russian admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy known for his victory in the Battle of Sinop and his leadership in the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855) during the Crimean War.

He joined the Imperial Russian Navy and moved up the ranks, serving in the Greek War of Independence and the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29). At the beginning of the Crimean War, he delivered a significant victory at the Battle of Sinop against the Ottoman Empire. Afterward, he was a leader in the defense of Sevastopol against British, French, and Ottoman forces, during which a sniper wounded him. He died a few days later.

After his death, he became a hero in Russia, with medals and ships named after him, especially during Soviet times, starting with Stalin. Also, a Soviet Film called &quot;Admiral Nakhimov&quot; was made in 1947 about his life.

== Early life ==
Nakhimov was born in the village of Gorodok in the Vyazma district of the Smolensk Governorate into a noble Russian family. He was the seventh of eleven children of a landlord and Second Major Stepan Mikhailovich Nakhimov and his wife Feodosia Ivanovna Nakhimova (née Kozlovskaya). Six of his siblings died as infants. He and all four of his brothers would become professional seamen, including Vice Admiral Sergei Stepanovich Nakhimov (1805—1872).

== Early military career ==
In 1817, he entered the Naval Academy for the Nobility (&quot;Morskoy Dvoryanskiy Korpus&quot;) in Saint Petersburg. That year, he made his first sea voyage aboard the frigate &quot;Feniks&quot; (&quot;Phoenix&quot;) to the shores of Sweden and Denmark. He was promoted to a non-commissioned officer soon after. In February 1818, he passed examinations to become a midshipman and was immediately assigned to the second Fleet Crew (&quot;Flotskiy Ekipazh&quot;) of the Russian Imperial Navy&#x27;s Baltic Fleet.

At the beginning of his naval career, Nakhimov&#x27;s experience was limited to voyages in the Baltic Sea as well as a more extensive trip from the White Sea port of Arkhangelsk to Kronstadt naval base near Saint Petersburg. His lucky break came in March 1822, when he was assigned to the frigate &quot;Kreiser&quot; (&quot;Cruiser&quot;); the vessel took part in a round-the-globe expedition commanded by the well-known Russian explorer Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev (1788-1851), who had already undertaken several such voyages.

During the three-year voyage, Nakhimov was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. On conclusion of this adventure, he received his first award, the Order of Saint Vladimir IV degree. He returned to his native Smolensk and was assigned to the 74-gun warship &quot;Azov&quot;, which made its maiden voyage from Arkhangelsk to Kronstadt in the autumn of 1826.

In the summer of 1827, &quot;Azov&quot; sailed to the Mediterranean as flagship of the Russian squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral Lodewijk van Heiden for a joint expedition with the French and British navies against the Ottomans. Just before its departure, Emperor Nicholas I visited the &quot;Azov&quot; and ordered that in the case of hostilities, the crew should deal with the enemy &quot;as the Russians do&quot;.

&quot;Azov&quot;, under then-Captain First Rank M.P. Lazarev, distinguished itself most prominently in the Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827), during which the allied British-French-Russian fleet &quot;totally&quot; destroyed the Ottoman squadron.
For his outstanding gunnery performance during the battle, the 27-year-old Nakhimov was promoted to the captaincy of a trophy ship and was decorated by the allied governments.

Early in his career, Nakhimov was criticized for &quot;brutality towards sailors&quot;; this allegation would not affect the public perception of him being a popular commander.

== Crimean War and death ==
=== Battle of Sinope ===
During the Crimean War of 1853-1856 Nakhimov distinguished himself by defeating the Ottoman fleet at Sinope in 1853.

Before the battle, the Russian fleet in the Black Sea was divided into two groups, one led by Nakhimov and the other by V. A. Kornilov. Nakhimov was assigned the eastern part of the sea. Meanwhile, the Ottomans knew Russian forces had been in the open sea since November 23. Still, for various reasons, including fear of facing Russia in the open sea, they decided to remain in port. Nakhimov asked for reinforcements, which he got on November 27, 1853, when a squadron led by Admiral Fyodor Mihailovich Novosilskiy joined Nakhimov&#x27;s squadron. By the time of the battle, Nakhimov had six battleships, two frigates, and three steamers and outgunned the Ottomans with weapons such as Paixhans guns.

On November 30, 1853, Nakhimov&#x27;s squadron entered the bay where the Ottoman fleet commanded by Admiral Osman Pasha was. At first, the Russian squadron demanded the surrender of the Ottoman fleet. After the Ottomans refused to surrender, the battle began. At first, the Ottoman ships did well against Nakhimov&#x27;s forces. However, the battle quickly turned against the Ottomans as the Russian guns proved too much, and in just a few hours, the Ottoman fleet was on fire. One ship, the Ottoman frigate &quot;Taif&quot;, started to head to Istanbul. The Russians were unable to capture the ship, even with the efforts of Russian Admiral V. A. Kornilov, who arrived with reinforcements. The Taif would arrive in Istanbul, delivering the news of Nakhimov&#x27;s victory on December 2. All of the Ottoman ships, except for the &quot;Taif&quot;, were &quot;devastated.&quot; Many Ottoman sailors died, although there is no agreement on exactly how many. Only 33-36 Russian sailors and one officer died during the battle. Admiral Osman was wounded in the foot and captured along with four other officers. Admiral Osman remained a prisoner of war until he was released in 1855.

Nakhimov kept firing during the battle despite most of the Ottoman ships being ablaze. It resulted in the burning of parts of the city, and its leaders and the Muslim population fled. He was criticized for attacking civilians during the battle. He later tried to explain his actions by sending an envoy to the city, arguing that he was seeking to &quot;destroy the Ottoman fleet.&quot;

=== Siege of Sevastopol and death ===
His finest hour came during the Siege of Sevastopol, where he and Admiral V. A. Kornilov organized from scratch the land defense of the city and its port, the home base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. As the commander of the port and the military governor of the city, Nakhimov became in fact the head of the Sevastopol naval and land defense forces. On , while inspecting the forward-defense positions on Malakhov Kurgan, he was fatally wounded by a sniper and died two days later.

== Legacy ==

=== Glorification ===
After his death, Nakhimov was glorified, which included misrepresenting facts. Becoming a part of the &quot;Sevastopol myth,&quot; in which Russian figures presented glorification of the defense of the city. This populist movement glorification of the battle was conducted alongside writers such as Leo Tolstoy. In publications, Nakhimov was represented as a &quot;friend of the common people&quot; and &quot;the soul of the defense of Sevastopol.&quot; Despite his popularity with populist factions, the Imperial government did not recognize Nakhimov, as evidenced by its efforts to force artists of the panoramic painting &quot;Defense of Sevastopol, 1854-5&quot; to remove his figure and replace it with Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov.

Despite him not being included in official government accounts, he was later honored in the Soviet Union by propagandists. During World War II, Nakhimov was turned into a national hero by the Soviet Union and Stalin alongside other figures like Prince Pyotr Bagration, Mikhail Kutuzov, Aleksandr Nevsky, and Aleksandr Suvorov.

=== Monuments and tributes ===
There are many monuments and medals created in his memory. In the 1890s a statue of Nakhimov along with Vladimir Alexeyevich Kornilov was put in Sevastopol. A bust portraying Russian admirals and sailors from the Crimean War, including Nakhimov, was erected at Sevastopol Park after renovations in 2008.

Nakhimov was buried inside St Vladimir&#x27;s Cathedral in Sevastopol along with Mikhail Lazarev, V.A. Kornilov and Vladimir Istomin. There is a monument erected in his memory. The Soviet government instituted posthumous honors as well, introducing Nakhimov Naval Schools for teenagers in 1943, and establishing in 1944 both the Order of Nakhimov (with two degrees) and the Nakhimov Medal for Navy personnel. The Order of Nakhimov, one of the highest military decorations in the Soviet Union, continues to exist in the Russian Federation.

== In popular culture ==
The 1947 Soviet movie &quot;Admiral Nakhimov&quot;, directed by Vsevolod Pudovkin, is about the life of Nakhimov. Soviet actor Aleksei Dikiy played Nakhimov. The movie covers Nakhimov&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Sinop and his defense of Sevastopol. The film had to be remade by Pudovkin as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union viewed the original film as having too much &quot;dancing&quot; and misrepresenting historical facts. Pudovkin removed the love story and &quot;toned down&quot; the dance scenes.

<doc id="345095" wikidata="Q363246" url="?curid=345095" title="Bill Walton">
<text>William Theodore Walton III (November 5, 1952 – May 27, 2024) was an American basketball player and television sportscaster. He played collegiately for UCLA Bruins and professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Portland Trail Blazers, San Diego / Los Angeles Clippers, and Boston Celtics. He is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.

Walton rose to prominence in the early 1970s as UCLA&#x27;s starting center for coach John Wooden. The Walton won three consecutive national college player of the year awards (1972–1974), while leading UCLA to NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak. After being selected as the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA draft, Walton led the Portland Trail Blazers to the team&#x27;s first and only NBA championship in 1977, earning the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award. The following season, Walton was the 1978 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP).

Walton&#x27;s professional career, however, was significantly hampered by foot injuries, requiring numerous surgeries (Walton underwent 37 orthopedic surgeries in his lifetime). Walton played in 468 out of 1,148 regular season games across his 14-year NBA career. After his MVP season, Walton sat out the 1978–79 season and was then signed by the Clippers, for whom he played four injury-plagued seasons. His career was rehabilitated during two seasons with the Celtics at the end of his career. Playing as a backup center behind Robert Parish, Walton earned the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in the 1985–86 season, winning his second NBA championship. He was named to the NBA&#x27;s 50th and 75th anniversary teams.

After retiring from the NBA, Walton overcame stuttering and embarked on a second career as a sportscaster, working both as a studio analyst and color commentator with several networks and teams. He earned an Emmy Award in 1991. Walton was a fan of the Grateful Dead, as a self-described &quot;Deadhead&quot;, and often mentioned them in his broadcasts. He hosted several podcasts and satellite radio programs featuring the music of the Grateful Dead.

==Early life==
Walton was born and raised in La Mesa, California, the son of Gloria Anne (née Hickey) and William Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Walton Jr. He was raised with siblings Bruce, Cathy, and Andy. The Walton home was on a hillside on Colorado Avenue, just below Lake Murray.

Walton&#x27;s father Ted was a music teacher and social worker and his mother Gloria, a librarian. His parents had interests in art, literature, politics, and music. Walton took music lessons, and although his parents were not sports-oriented, Walton followed in the footsteps of his older brother Bruce, who had gravitated toward sports. When the Walton children were in junior high and high school, their father formed an informal family band: Bruce played trombone, Bill played baritone horn, Andy played the saxophone, and Cathy played drums (or flute or tuba).

Walton first played organized basketball under Frank &quot;Rocky&quot; Graciano, who coached at Walton&#x27;s Catholic elementary school. Walton said that Graciano &quot;made it [basketball] fun and really emphasized the joy of playing the team game. I was a skinny, scrawny guy. I stuttered horrendously, couldn&#x27;t speak at all. I was a very shy, reserved player and a very shy, reserved person. I found a safe place in life in basketball.&quot;

==High school career==
Walton played high school basketball at Helix High School in La Mesa alongside his brother Bruce, who was one year older at and (he was a star football player as well). During games with the two Waltons on the court, any tough physical treatment laid out on Bill would be matched back by Bruce in turn.

&quot;When those opposing teams would try to get physical with me, Bruce would do whatever it took to protect me,&quot; Walton recalled. &quot;He went on to play for the Dallas Cowboys. Bruce and I are the only brother combination in history to ever play in the Super Bowl and to win the NBA championship.&quot;

&quot;When they would begin to rough up Bill, I would look at coach and he would give me a nod.&quot; recalled Bruce. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Gloria Walton, &quot;then when the referee wasn&#x27;t looking, Bruce would give the player an elbow and let him know that the skinny guy was his kid brother.&quot;

Walton&#x27;s struggle with injury and pain began while at Helix, where he broke an ankle, a leg, several bones in his feet, and underwent knee surgery. Before his sophomore season, Walton underwent surgery to repair torn cartilage on his left knee. Because of his recovery from the knee surgery, Walton played most of his sophomore year on the junior varsity team. Coach Gordon Nash promoted him to the varsity team the end of the season. But, he played in only six games and did not start any of them.

Between his sophomore and junior years of high school (age 15–16), Walton grew from to . Coach Nash played Bill and Bruce Walton together in the paint. Bill was taller, but frail as he had not filled out his growing frame. Bill was unable to play a complete game without resting. &quot;He would simply get too tired&quot;, recalled Nash. &quot;When that happened, he&#x27;d tell me and I&#x27;d take him out.&quot;

While Walton was in high school in 1967, the NBA expansion San Diego Rockets came to town. The Rockets had no set practice facility and would often play pick-up games at Helix High School. Rocket players learned that to get into the Helix gym they could call the teenage Walton, who had his own gym key. Walton recalled Elvin Hayes calling and telling his mother, &quot;Tell Billy, Big E is calling and we need him to open the gym tonight. I said, &#x27;Mom, that&#x27;s Big E! Give me the phone!&#x27; I was never so embarrassed in my life. Elvin and I are still close friends. All of those guys, all still my friends to this very day.&quot;

&quot;We had the best gym in San Diego and all the Rockets players wanted to go there,&quot; Walton reflected. &quot;They had some great teams with Elvin Hayes and Calvin Murphy and future head coaches and broadcasters such as Pat Riley, Rick Adelman, Rudy Tomjanovich, Jim Barnett, and Stu Lantz. All these guys treated me—little Billy—like I was part of the team. They couldn&#x27;t have been nicer, and I became their friend.&quot;

===Championships and national records===
Walton overcame all obstacles and led Helix to 49 consecutive victories in his two varsity seasons. Helix won the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Championship in both 1969 and 1970, finishing 29–2 in 1968–69 and 33–0 in 1969–70. He graduated at about tall. Walton averaged 29 points and 25 rebounds, as Helix finished 33–0 in his senior season.

As a senior in 1969–70, Walton made 384 of 490 shot attempts, 78.3 percent, still the all-time national record. In addition, Walton&#x27;s 825 rebounds that season ranks No 3 all-time. His 25.0 rebounds per game in a season ranks 7 all-time.

In 1970, Walton was featured in &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot; in the January 26 issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, his first national media recognition.

&quot;It was a dream come true to be a part of a special team,&quot; Walton said. &quot;Helix is where it all began. It was a humbling honor and privilege to be on the same squad as true legends Monroe Nash, Wilbur Strong, Phil Edwards, and Bruce Menser. I&#x27;m the luckiest guy on earth.&quot;

Hall of Fame Coach Denny Crum, then an assistant coach at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under John Wooden, was sent to watch Walton play. Crum first saw Walton in 1968 as a high school junior and was at first dubious when hearing of Walton, but went to scout him anyway. &quot;I came back and told Coach Wooden that this Walton kid was the best high school player I&#x27;d ever seen,&quot; Crum recalled.

==College career==
Beginning in elementary and high school, Walton had loyally followed UCLA&#x27;s basketball team on the radio. He was recruited by many colleges, but quickly accepted UCLA&#x27;s scholarship offer to play basketball for the Bruins and Coach Wooden. Wooden became a lifetime mentor to Walton.

Said Walton of Coach Wooden: &quot;I was John Wooden&#x27;s easiest recruit. I became his worst nightmare. I drove the poor guy to an early grave when he was 99. I had three different periods of my life in my relationship with him: (1) when I was a high school student and he was recruiting me; (2) when I played for him when I was 17 to 21; (3) and then 36 years of being his friend. I had no idea what we had at UCLA. I thought everybody had the same thing: great parents, great schools, great neighborhoods, great colleges, great coaches. Then I joined the NBA. And I realized immediately that I had just absolutely blown this whole deal with John Wooden. And so I spent the rest of my life, first of all, trying to make it up to him; and second of all, no longer [bringing] consternation into his life.&quot;

Walton played for UCLA under Coach Wooden from 1971 to 1974. His older brother Bruce played football at UCLA, enrolling a year ahead of Bill. Bill Walton led the Bruins to two consecutive 30–0 seasons and the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball record 88-game winning streak. The UCLA streak contributed to a personal winning streak of 142 games that lasted almost five years, in which Walton&#x27;s high school, UCLA freshman (freshmen were ineligible for the varsity at that time) and UCLA varsity teams did not lose a game from the middle of his junior year of high school to the middle of his senior year in college.

===Freshman season (1970–1971)===
Prior to joining the varsity team, Walton (18.1 ppg, 68.6% field goal accuracy), along with Greg Lee (17.9 ppg) and Keith Wilkes (20.0 ppg), was a member of the 20–0 1970–71 UCLA freshman team.

The varsity UCLA team, led by seniors Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe, and Steve Patterson defeated Villanova in the 1971 NCAA Championship Game for UCLA&#x27;s 5th consecutive NCAA title.

After Walton initially refused to cut his hair as an incoming freshman, Coach Wooden told Walton &quot;we&#x27;ll miss you.&quot; Walton then rode his bike to a nearby barber.

===Sophomore season (1971–1972)===
The 1971–72 UCLA basketball team had a record of 30–0, winning its games by an average margin of more than 30 points, averaging 94.6 points to opponents&#x27; 64.3. With Walton playing alongside Henry Bibby, Larry Farmer, Wilkes, Lee, and Swen Nater, UCLA finished 14–0 in the Pac 8 Conference.

In the 25-team 1972 NCAA tournament, UCLA defeated Weber State 90–58. They defeated Long Beach State and coach Jerry Tarkanian in the Western Regional final 73–57 to reach the Final Four. Playing 20 minutes due to foul trouble, Walton had four points and 12 rebounds in the victory over Weber State, taking only one shot. He had 19 points and 11 rebounds against Long Beach State.

In the 1972 Final Four, Walton had 33 points and 21 rebounds, on 11 of 13 shooting and 11 of 12 free-throws, against Louisville in the NCAA semifinal, as UCLA won 96–77. In the NCAA championship game, he had 24 points and 20 rebounds in the Bruins&#x27; 81–76 victory over Florida State. Walton was named the 1972 NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player.

Overall, in 30 games in 1971–72, Walton averaged 21.1 points and 15.5 rebounds, shooting 64.0% from the field. He was named first-team All-American with Jim Chones of Marquette, Bo Lamar of the Louisiana-Lafayette, Ed Ratleff of Long Beach State, and Tom Riker of South Carolina.

===Junior season (1972–1973)===
UCLA again finished 30–0 overall and 14–0 in the Pac-8 conference in 1972–73, winning its games by an average margin of more than 20 points, averaging 81.3 points to their opponents&#x27; 60.1.

In the 25-team 1973 NCAA tournament, UCLA defeated Arizona State 98–81 and then San Francisco in the West Regional Final 54–39 to reach the Final Four. Walton had 28 points and 14 rebounds against Arizona State, on 13 of 18 shooting, and 9 points and 14 rebounds against San Francisco, taking only 7 shots.

In the 1973 Final Four, the Bruins won the national semifinal 70–59 over Indiana and Hall of Fame coach Bob Knight. Walton had 14 points, seven rebounds, and nine assists against Indiana.

In the 1973 NCAA title game against Memphis State, Walton had arguably the best individual performance in an NCAA championship game, which was the first held on Monday night. At the St. Louis Arena on March 26, Walton scored 44 points on near-perfect 21 of 22 shooting. He added 13 rebounds, two assists, and one block, to lead the Bruins to a seventh straight title, 87–66 over Memphis State; the Tigers were led by head coach Gene Bartow (who replaced Wooden at UCLA three years later), with players Larry Kenon and Larry Finch. Walton set the record for most points in an NCAA championship game, which still stands, and was the tournament&#x27;s most outstanding player.

Walton was hurt and left the game for the final time, with UCLA leading 75–62 and just under three minutes remaining. Playing with four personal fouls, Walton fell hard to the floor on a play and injured his left knee and ankle. He then limped off the floor, receiving an ovation from the 19,301 fans.

&quot;I don&#x27;t think anything ever meant as much to me as playing UCLA and one of John Wooden&#x27;s best teams for the national championship&quot;, Bartow said in 1993. &quot;We were able to go right through the press.&quot; At halftime, the game was tied 39–39. Bartow added, &quot;I felt very good at halftime, very good. But to win, we also felt we had to control Walton. We couldn&#x27;t let him dominate the game. Obviously, we didn&#x27;t do a good job of that. Bill Walton probably had one of the best games anybody ever had in the history of college basketball.&quot;

&quot;Coach Wooden looked at me and said, &#x27;Walton, I used to think you were a good player until you missed that one shot, Walton said.

Overall in 1972–73, Walton averaged 20.4 points and 16.9 rebounds in 30 games on 65.0% shooting, as UCLA again finished 30–0 (14–0 in the Pac-8 conference). Walton was a consensus All-American alongside Ernie DiGregorio of Providence, Ed Ratleff of Long Beach State, David Thompson of North Carolina State, and Kermit Washington of American.

Walton&#x27;s political personality was alive in his collegiate years on the UCLA campus. &quot;One of the saddest days for Coach Wooden was the day he came down and had to bail me out of jail after I got arrested in the anti-Vietnam (War) protest. He said, &#x27;Bill, I know you feel very strongly about this, but I just don&#x27;t think that you getting arrested and taking part in this demonstration is what it&#x27;s all about,&#x27;&quot; recalled Walton.

&quot;I had no problem with him during the season,&quot; Wooden said of Walton&#x27;s college days. &quot;Off the floor I worried. I worried when he was thrown in jail with the group that took over the administration building, I worried when he stopped traffic on Wilshire Boulevard, and when he interrupted classes giving his views on the Vietnam War.&quot;

===Senior season (1973–1974)===
In Walton&#x27;s senior year, UCLA&#x27;s 88-game winning streak ended with a 71–70 loss at Notre Dame on January 19, 1974. Walton played wearing a back brace, as he had suffered a major back injury in a fall against Washington State the week before. He was undercut by a Washington State player and broke two bones in his spine, which remained damaged until corrective surgery in 2009. He missed three games. But, he made 12 of his first 13 shots and the Bruins led Notre Dame by 17 points at halftime. UCLA was leading 70–59 with 3½ minutes remaining. However, they were outscored 12–0, missing six consecutive shots with four turnovers. As was his belief, Wooden did not call time-outs late in games and stuck with the strategy. The Irish made six shots in a row, winning on Dwight Clay&#x27;s shot with 29 seconds left, as Notre Dame prevailed 71–70. Walton, who missed a 12-foot shot off an inbounds pass to win the game as time expired, finished with 24 points and nine rebounds. He said of his efforts that day, &quot;A complete failure on all levels, particularly as a human being. A disgrace to the game of basketball, a disgrace to sport.&quot;

A week later, the Bruins beat the Fighting Irish 94–75 at home. Later in the season, UCLA dropped consecutive games in consecutive days at Oregon and Oregon State, nicknamed &quot;the Lost Weekend&quot;. &quot;There were so many problems&quot;, Walton said of the losses. &quot;Injuries [he missed games with a bad back]. Team chemistry. It was just a nightmare.&quot;

UCLA finished 26–4 and 12–2 in the Pac 8 Conference, with Walton playing alongside Keith Wilkes, David Myers, and Marques Johnson.

In the 25 team 1974 NCAA tournament, UCLA defeated Dayton 111–100, in a game where Walton had 27 points and 19 rebounds. UCLA next defeated San Francisco 83–60 in the Western Regional Final to reach the Final Four. Walton tallied 17 points, nine rebounds, and four assists against San Francisco.

In the 1974 Final Four, UCLA&#x27;s record seven consecutive national titles was broken. North Carolina State defeated the Bruins 80–77 in double overtime in the NCAA semi-finals. Walton played 50 minutes and scored 29 points, adding 18 rebounds and 4 assists in the loss. The UCLA–North Carolina State game was No. 13 on &quot;USA Today&quot;″s list of the greatest NCAA tournament games of all time. Walton called the game the most disappointing outcome of his entire basketball career, as UCLA had a 5-point lead late in regulation and a 7-point lead in the 2nd overtime, before NC State with David Thompson rallied to win, 80–77.

&quot;David Thompson&#x27;s a great champion. He is a wonderful person and a very special human being&quot;, Walton said. &quot;He was really fun to play against. He was a dynamic big moment guy, and I just wish I could have risen to the occasion.&quot;

&quot;That failure has plagued me, and will, it is a stigma on my soul, and there&#x27;s no way I can get rid of it.&quot; Walton said of the loss, &quot;We could have, we should have won them all, and we didn&#x27;t get it done. And when you&#x27;re in that position, it&#x27;s the worst feeling in the world. That&#x27;s the timelessness of pain and suffering; the agonizing, the reflection and the endless questioning of yourself. When you&#x27;re right there and it&#x27;s there for you and the whole world is watching, and it&#x27;s recorded as history that can never be changed, that is a terribly heavy burden.&quot;

UCLA had to come back and play in the NCAA 3rd place game, in which they eventually defeated Kansas. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to play and I told Coach Wooden that. We had a bitter argument over that, and I lost that argument, too&quot;, said Walton, who took only three shots as UCLA had a 78–61 win. He played 20 minutes in his last game for UCLA and Coach Wooden. &quot;Twenty minutes too much&quot;, he said.

Overall, as a senior, Walton averaged 19.3 points, 14.7 rebounds, and 5.5 assists. He was named 1st Team All-American alongside Marvin Barnes of Providence, John Shumate of Notre Dame, David Thompson of North Carolina State, and teammate Wilkes of UCLA.

===College totals===
In his 87 career games at UCLA, Walton shot 65.1% from the field, averaging 20.3 points, 15.7 rebounds, and 5.5 assists. UCLA was 86–4 in Walton&#x27;s three seasons.

Walton was the 1973 recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Walton also received the USBWA College Player of the Year and Naismith College Player of the Year as the top college basketball player in 1972, 1973, and 1974. He earned Academic All-American honors in 1972, 1973 and 1974. Some college basketball historians rate Walton as the greatest who ever played at the college level.

Walton left UCLA to begin a new life in professional basketball and kept a lifetime friendship with Coach Wooden. &quot;Coach Wooden never talked about winning and losing, but rather about the effort to win. He rarely talked about basketball, but generally about life. He never talked about strategy, statistics or plays, but rather about people and character. Coach Wooden never tired of telling us that once you become a good person, then you have a chance of becoming a good basketball player.&quot;

==Professional career==

===Portland Trail Blazers (1974–1979)===

==== Injury-plagued early years (1974–1976) ====
Walton was drafted by the American Basketball Association&#x27;s Dallas Chaparrals in the 1973 ABA draft as an underclassman in an attempt to lure him from UCLA. In the locker room after the 1973 Championship game, Coach Wooden introduced Walton to representatives of the ABA, who hoped to convince him to turn pro. &quot;Of which I had no interest in doing&quot;, Walton said.

In 1974, the ABA&#x27;s San Diego Conquistadors tried to persuade Walton to sign with them, after drafting him in the 1974 ABA draft. San Diego had also signed Wilt Chamberlain as a player-coach as further incentive. Walton was not swayed.

Walton was the number one overall pick by the NBA&#x27;s Portland Trail Blazers in the 1974 NBA draft. Walton signed with the Trail Blazers.

Walton&#x27;s first two seasons in Portland were marred by chronic foot injuries. In addition, during his first two years, Walton badly sprained an ankle, broke his left wrist twice, dislocated two toes, dislocated two fingers, broke a toe and injured his leg in a jeep accident.

As a rookie in 1974–75, Walton averaged a double-double 12.8 points, 12.6 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 2.7 blocks in 35 games. The Trail Blazers with Geoff Petrie, Sidney Wicks, and LaRue Martin finished 38–44 under player/coach Lenny Wilkens.

In 1975–76, Walton averaged 16.1 points, 13.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.6 blocks in 51 games as Portland, with rookies Bob Gross and Lionel Hollins, finished 37–45.

==== First championship and Finals MVP (1976–1977) ====
In the 1976–77 season Walton played in 65 games and, spurred by new head coach Jack Ramsay, Walton and a newly acquired ABA draftee in Maurice Lucas, the Trail Blazers became the Cinderella team of the NBA. In a pre-season meeting with his new coach, Walton had advised Ramsay, &quot;Coach, don&#x27;t assume we know anything.&quot;

Walton led the NBA in both rebounds per game (14.4) and blocked shots per game (3.2) as he was selected to the NBA All-Star Game, but did not participate due to an injury. Walton was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team and the All-NBA Second Team for his regular-season accomplishments. He averaged 18.6 points, 14.4 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 3.2 blocks and Portland finished 49–33.

In the 1977 postseason, Walton led #3 seed Portland to series victories over the Chicago Bulls with Artis Gilmore (2–1) and the Denver Nuggets with Dan Issel (4–2). He averaged 17.3 points, 12.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 4.3 blocks in the first round series against the Bulls. In the Nuggets series Walton averaged 17.5 points, 13.0 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 3.0 blocks. In a 4–0 series sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1977 Western Conference finals, Walton averaged 19.3 points, 14.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 2.3 blocks playing against fellow UCLA alum Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. That season, Abdul-Jabbar won the NBA&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award; Walton finished second.

Portland matched up in the 1977 NBA Finals against the favored Philadelphia 76ers. After losing the first two games, the Blazers won four straight to win the NBA championship. Walton scored 20 points and grabbed 23 rebounds in the clinching Game 6 victory, and was named the Finals MVP with averages of 18.5 points, 19.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.0 steals, and 3.7 blocks, which prompted Philadelphia 76ers coach Gene Shue to comment after the series: &quot;Bill Walton is the best player for a big man who ever played the game of basketball.&quot;

==== MVP campaign and holdout (1977–1979) ====
The following season, the 1977–78 Trail Blazers won 50 of their first 60 games, as Walton averaged 18.9 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 2.5 blocks in 58 games. Walton then suffered a broken foot, ending his regular season. During this time, he befriended the controversial writer Jack Scott, who wrote and published a book about him in 1978. Walton nonetheless won the 1978 NBA Most Valuable Player award and the &quot;Sporting News&quot; NBA MVP, as well. Walton played in his only NBA All-Star Game in 1978 and was named to both the NBA&#x27;s First All-Defensive Team and the All-NBA First Team.

Portland finished the regular season 58–24 and Walton returned for the 1978 NBA playoffs. He was injured and lost for the remainder of the playoffs in the second game of the first-round series against the Seattle SuperSonics. After having received a painkilling injection to play, X-rays taken after Game 2 revealed the navicular bone below Walton&#x27;s left ankle was broken. Portland lost the series to Seattle in six games. Walton would never play for the Trail Blazers again.

During the off-season, Walton demanded to be traded, citing unethical and incompetent treatment of his and other players&#x27; injuries by the Blazers&#x27; front office. He did not get his wish and sat out the entire 1979 season in protest. Walton eventually signed with the San Diego Clippers when he became a free agent in 1979.

In five seasons with Portland, Walton played in 209 games, averaging a double-double of 17.1 points and 13.5 rebounds, with 4.4 assists and 2.6 blocks.

===San Diego Clippers (1979–1985)===
On May 13, 1979, Walton signed as a veteran free agent with the San Diego Clippers; the Portland Trail Blazers received Kevin Kunnert, Kermit Washington and a 1980 first-round draft pick (Mike Gminski was later selected) as compensation ordered by the NBA. Walton reportedly agreed to a seven-year, $7 million contract.

Due to injuries, Walton spent more time on the disabled list than on the court with his hometown team. In his first season with San Diego, Walton played 14 games for the Clippers in the 1979–80 season. Walton re-fractured the navicular bone in the fourth 1979 exhibition game and subsequently missed all of the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons, undergoing several surgeries on his injured foot. Walton ignored doctors who said he would never play again and underwent surgery to restructure his left foot in 1981. His high arch, which made the foot bones susceptible to breaking, was lowered to relieve the stress on the bones.

Following extensive rehabilitation, which included biking and sand volleyball, Walton&#x27;s foot began to improve; after playing only 14 games from 1979 to 1982, he played 33 games in 1982–83 under doctor&#x27;s orders to play about one game per week. He played in 55 games in 1983–84, and a then-career-high 67 in 1984–85, by which time the Clippers had relocated to Los Angeles.

&quot;When you fail in your hometown, that&#x27;s as bad as it gets, and I love my hometown&quot;, said Walton of his tenure in San Diego. &quot;I wish we had NBA basketball here, and we don&#x27;t because of me. It&#x27;s my greatest failure as a professional in my entire life, I could not get the job done in my hometown. It is a stain and stigma on my soul that is indelible. I&#x27;ll never be able to wash that off, and I carry it with me forever.&quot;

On Clippers owner Donald Sterling, Walton commented, &quot;The checks bounced higher than the basketballs when Donald Sterling took over. The basketball was awful, and the business side was immoral, dishonest, corrupt, and illegal. Other than that, it was all fine.&quot;

In 169 games with the Clippers, Walton averaged 11.9 points, 9.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 2.3 blocks, shooting 53.2%. The Clippers never finished near .500 or made the playoffs in his tenure with the franchise. As his feet became more durable, the Clippers had won 30 and 31 games in his final two seasons. At age 32, Walton wished to move to a winning franchise and reached out to teams after the season ended in 1985.

===Boston Celtics (1985–1987)===

==== Second championship and sixth man award (1985–1986) ====
After the 1984–85 campaign, Walton called on two of the league&#x27;s premier teams, the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers. After several players on the Celtics said they liked the idea of having Walton as a teammate backing up Robert Parish and Kevin McHale, Red Auerbach made the deal happen. One anecdote that particularly illustrates Walton&#x27;s decision to choose the Celtics over the Lakers involves Larry Bird, who happened to be in Auerbach&#x27;s office when Walton called. Bird said that if Walton felt healthy enough to play that it was good enough for him, as opposed to Lakers GM Jerry West, who was hedging his interest in Walton pending a doctor&#x27;s report.

On September 6, 1985, Walton was traded by the Los Angeles Clippers to the Boston Celtics for Cedric Maxwell and a 1986 1st round draft pick (Arvydas Sabonis was later selected).

Walton described doctors looking at his X-rays at the hospital after he arrived in Boston: And then Red, he bursts in through the double doors ... and he&#x27;s smoking his cigar in the hospital, and he walks in and says, &quot;Who are you guys and what are you doing with my player?&quot; And they&#x27;re saying, &quot;Red, come here. Look at this. Look at his feet. Look at his face. We can&#x27;t pass this guy.&quot; And Red says, &quot;Shut up. I&#x27;m in charge here.&quot; And Red pushes his way through all the doctors, comes over. I&#x27;m lying on the table there in the doctors examining room. Red looks down at me. He says, &quot;Walton, can you play?&quot; I looked up at him with the sad, soft eyes of a young man who just wanted one more chance. One more chance to be part of something special, to be part of the team, to be with the guys one more time. And I looked up at him, and I said, &quot;Red, I think I can. I think I can, Red.&quot; And Red, through the smoke, with a big, cherubic grin on his face, looked at the doctors, looked at me, and he said, &quot;He&#x27;s fine. He passes. Let&#x27;s go. We&#x27;ve got a game.&quot; And we were able to go out and win a championship. I&#x27;m the luckiest guy in the world. Thank you Red Auerbach. Thank you Larry Bird. Thank you Boston Celtics. Thank you people of New England. Thank you Celtic nation. Wow. What a dream come true.

In his first time in a Celtics uniform in the Boston Garden, Walton received one-minute standing ovation from the Boston home crowd walking onto the court for his first exhibition game in 1985.

Walton played a career-high 80 games for Coach KC Jones and the Celtics during the 1985–86 season. Walton averaged 7.6 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.2 blocks in 19 minutes, and finished with a career-high 56.2 field goal percentage. Providing a reliable backup to Kevin McHale and Robert Parish, and playing alongside Larry Bird, Danny Ainge and Dennis Johnson, Walton received the 1986 NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award en route to the NBA championship. He became the only player to have won an NBA Finals MVP, Sixth Man Award, and regular season MVP.

The 1986 NBA playoffs were Walton&#x27;s first taste of the postseason in nearly a decade, at age 33. Backing up McHale and Parish, he averaged 6.7 points, 9.3 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and 2.0 blocks in 19 minutes as the Celtics&#x27; had a 3–0 sweep in the Eastern Conference first round over the Chicago Bulls with Michael Jordan (43.7 point average in the series).

In the Celtics&#x27; 4–1 series win over the Atlanta Hawks with Dominique Wilkins in the Eastern Conference semi-finals, Walton averaged 8.0 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 1.3 assists in 13 minutes. In the Eastern Conference Finals 4–0 sweep against the Milwaukee Bucks, Walton averaged 8.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 2.0 assists in 18 minutes.

In the 1986 NBA Finals, the Celtics defeated the Houston Rockets with &quot;Twin Towers&quot; Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson 4–2 to win the NBA Championship. Walton averaged 8.0 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.0 assists, and 2.2 blocks in 19 minutes, in helping the Celtics win the championship.

&quot;I knew we had something going when we got Walton&quot;, Larry Bird said on Walton and the 1985–86 Celtics. &quot;It was all a matter of if he could stay healthy. We already had a pretty good team, and I think adding him and (Jerry) Sichting really helped us. Robert Parish accepting Bill Walton for who he is and what kind of player he was, I thought that was major. That&#x27;s the best team I&#x27;ve ever been on, no question about that. I mean, we were good from top to bottom.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#x27;t important to me because I had no say in the personnel decisions, but what I was impressed with was Bill Walton&#x27;s character&quot;, Parish said of Walton joining the Celtics. &quot;He thought enough of me to make sure I was comfortable with him being on the team. That&#x27;s why I have the utmost respect for Bill Walton and that&#x27;s the main reason why he was my inductee into the Hall of Fame. Bill Walton is my main man, for that reason.&quot;

==== Injury-plagued final playing year (1986–1987) ====
Walton was injured again in the 1986–87 regular season, but returned in time for the 1987 playoffs. He played in only ten games during the season.

Walton spent the 1987–88 season on the Celtics&#x27; injured list. He attempted a comeback in February 1990, but injuries intervened and he retired as a player.

Overall, Walton played 90 total games for the Celtics, shooting 55.1% and averaging 7.0 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.3 blocks in 18 minutes.

==National team career==
At age 17, just out of high school, in the summer of 1970, Walton was selected to represent the U.S. national basketball team at the 1970 FIBA World Championship. The team, under coach Hal Fisher, failed to win a medal in the tournament, coming in a disappointing fifth place. By far the youngest player on the roster and in the tournament, Walton played minimally in five games, averaging 2.6 points.

===1972 Olympics===
Walton was selected to the 1972 U.S. Olympic basketball team, but declined to participate. Some saw it as a political statement given Walton&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War, but the most likely reason for his decision was his bad experience at the 1970 World Championships. In a 2004 interview with ESPN, Walton stated that &quot;for the first time in my life, I was exposed to negative coaching and the berating of players and the foul language and the threatening of people who didn&#x27;t perform.&quot;

In the men&#x27;s basketball final, the United States controversially lost to the Soviet Union 51–50, finishing in second place. According to Russian sports historian Robert Edelman, &quot;when [the Russians] saw who was and wasn&#x27;t on the U.S. team, that&#x27;s when they started feeling like they&#x27;d actually have a chance. They followed American basketball closely and they knew that no Walton was going to be a big deal.&quot; 1972 U.S. team&#x27;s forward James Forbes told ESPN as part of a &quot;SportsCentury&quot; documentary, &quot;If [Walton] plays, all of this becomes academic.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Coach Jack Ramsay, in 2010, called Walton the best Portland Trail Blazer, &quot;hands down no question.&quot; &quot;Walton could do everything, he had great timing, complete vision of the floor, had excellent fundamentals and was a great passer, both in outlet passes and in the half court. He loved playing basketball, just loved it, practices, games ... especially away games. He loved to win on the opponent&#x27;s court. And he had a great head, a very dedicated team player.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oregonian/OregonLive-2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Of Walton&#x27;s injuries, Ramsay added, &quot;And that was very frustrating to both of us. To not be able to play was a crushing blow to him. And to me it was frustrating because I finally had a great team and a great player and it was all coming apart.&quot; Summarizing Walton&#x27;s skill set, Ramsay has stated: “Bill Russell was a great shot blocker. Wilt Chamberlain was a great offensive player. But Walton can do it all.”

&quot;I&#x27;m here to try and make amends for the mistakes and errors of the past&quot;, Walton, said to the press in returning to Portland in 2009. &quot;I regret that I wasn&#x27;t a better person. A better player. I regret that I got hurt. I regret the circumstances in which I left the Portland Trail Blazers family. I just wish I could do a lot of things over, but I can&#x27;t. So I&#x27;m here to apologize, to try and make amends, and to try and start over and make it better.&quot;

Said Walton reflecting on his career: &quot;I loved basketball. And I was going to go until I couldn&#x27;t go anymore. I had no desire to ever stop playing. I&#x27;ve never met anybody who stopped playing voluntarily. I ground my body up. I&#x27;ve had 37 (38 now) orthopedic operations. I ground my feet up into dust. I&#x27;ve got a new knee. I&#x27;ve got a new spine. I&#x27;m the lucky one, in that I never thought going through all of it that I would be healthy at the end. And I almost wasn&#x27;t. But I&#x27;m all better now.&quot;

&quot;I would love to play one more game&quot;, Walton said he wished. &quot;But then I would want to play another one. And another one. But I will take one.&quot;

Overall, Walton played 468 games in his NBA career. He averaged a career double-double of 13.3 points, 10.5 rebounds, with 3.4 assists and 2.2 blocked shots, averaging 28 minutes. He shot 52.1% from the floor for his career. Walton&#x27;s injuries and surgeries limited his career, and counting his 1978–1979 year-long holdout, Walton played in 44% of the regular season games in his 13-year career. His listed playing height was ; it has been reported that Walton was actually taller ( or more), but he does not like being categorized as a seven-footer.

In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Walton as the 64th greatest player in NBA history. Encyclopædia Britannica considers him as &quot;one of the best all-around players in the history of basketball&quot;.

==Media career==
Walton overcame a stuttering problem at age 28 with the help of legendary broadcaster Marty Glickman, after a lengthy conversation between the two at an event.

Walton said about his speech issues and subsequent career, &quot;I&#x27;m a stutterer. I never spoke to anybody. I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine. But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can&#x27;t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It&#x27;s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else&#x27;s biggest nightmare.&quot;

After his retirement as a player, Walton became a basketball color commentator. Walton worked for CBS (1990), NCAA on CBS (1991), NBC (1990–2002), the Los Angeles Clippers (1990–2002) and ABC/ESPN (2002–2009). After 19 years working in broadcasting, he left ESPN in November 2009, as the result of back problems, which dated back to an injury he suffered in college at UCLA. Following surgery on his back, Walton returned to broadcasting as a part-time commentator for the Sacramento Kings for 2010–11 and 2011–12. In July 2012, ESPN and the Pac-12 Network announced that Walton would return to full-time broadcasting as a game analyst for Pac-12 conference basketball coverage.

Walton frequently worked alongside Dave Pasch while calling Pac-12 games. His commentary has been noted for his frequent use of catchphrases and hyperbole. Walton typically was paired with Steve &quot;Snapper&quot; Jones for national NBA games because he and Jones had a point-counterpoint banter during games.

Walton&#x27;s 2003 TV series &quot;Bill Walton&#x27;s Long Strange Trip&quot; aired on ESPN with Walton as subject and star.

While broadcasting a game between the Oregon Ducks and USC Trojans, Walton talked about a speech Bob Dylan gave at MusiCares, and ESPN had prepared graphics about Dylan&#x27;s career highlights.

While broadcasting a Washington–Oregon January 2019 game with Dave Pasch, Walton mentioned he had appeared in the motion picture &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was filmed in 1984 and Pasch questioned Walton about his claim throughout the game as to the specifics of his appearance and character, but Walton refused to provide more details. Research validated Walton&#x27;s claim.

Walton hosted his own satellite radio show, &quot;One More Saturday Night&quot; (named after the Dead song of the same name), heard on Sirius Radio&#x27;s Jam On and XM Radio&#x27;s Grateful Dead channel.

In 2001, Walton received an Emmy Award for &quot;Best Live Sports Television Broadcast&quot;. In 2018, he won the CoSIDA Dick Enberg Award.

==Personal life==
===Family===

Walton met his first wife, Susie, while they were attending UCLA and he was a sophomore. They were married in 1979 and divorced in 1989. They had four sons—Adam, Nathan, Luke, and Chris—who were all at least tall and played basketball. At the time of his death, Walton resided in his hometown of San Diego with his second wife, Lori Matsuoka (m. 1991).
His son Luke became an NBA player, winning both the 2009 and 2010 NBA Finals with the Lakers. The titles made Bill and Luke the first NBA father-son pair to have both won multiple NBA championships. Luke was the head coach of the Lakers (2016–2019), after two years as an assistant for the Golden State Warriors. In April 2019, Luke Walton was named head coach of the Sacramento Kings. Luke was named after Walton&#x27;s friend and former teammate Maurice Lucas. &quot;Maurice was so important in my life and in little Luke&#x27;s life,&quot; Walton said. &quot;Whenever there was a big moment for little Luke, big Luke would show up unannounced to make sure it all turned out right.&quot;

Chris Walton played basketball for San Diego State. He is a real estate executive. Nate Walton played basketball at Princeton. He entered the corporate world and earned his MBA from Stanford University&#x27;s Graduate School of Business. Walton attended Stanford Law School starting in the fall of 1981 while with the Clippers but did not graduate.

Nate was on the ballot for the 2003 California Recall election, receiving 1,697 votes. He has been highly successful in the oil business.

Adam Walton played at Louisiana State University, Pomona College and the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, California. He was a college assistant coach at San Diego Mesa College. Walton&#x27;s other brother, Bruce Walton, played in the National Football League with the Dallas Cowboys from 1973 to 1975. They were basketball teammates in high school. Bill followed Bruce in attending UCLA. Bruce played in Super Bowl X, making Bill and Bruce the only brothers to play in the Super Bowl and NBA Finals. Walton&#x27;s sister Cathy was a youth swimmer and played some basketball at the University of California.

===Friendships===
Walton maintained a close lifetime friendship with coach John Wooden, visiting him often. &quot;Coach Wooden is the most influential person in my life outside of my mom and dad, but when we played for him, he was older than our parents, and we thought our parents were the oldest people on earth&quot;, Walton said. &quot;So the things he taught us made no sense to us. We thought he was nuts, but when you&#x27;re hot and when you&#x27;re on top and it&#x27;s all happening, you never think. We were so young and we had always won. So we had no real idea how fragile everything was. Everything that Coach Wooden told us eventually came true.&quot; Despite his opposition to Walton&#x27;s protest activities, Wooden also one time bailed Walton out of jail after he was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest. On Walton&#x27;s desk sat a message to him from Coach Wooden: &quot;To Bill Walton, it&#x27;s the things you learn after you know it all that count. John Wooden.&quot;

Walton also considered himself a fan and friend of the writer Ken Kesey. In 2015, he made a visit to the Ken Kesey Collection while on a stop at the University of Oregon. His memoir, &quot;Back from the Dead: Searching for the Sound, Shining the Light and Throwing It Down&quot;, was released by Simon &amp; Schuster in March 2016. It remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for two weeks in April 2016. Walton, who had a service dog, wrote the foreword to the 2015 book &quot;Unconditional Honor: Wounded Warriors and their Dogs&quot; by author Cathy Scott.

===Grateful Dead fandom===
Walton was a fan of the Grateful Dead, whose concerts he started attending in 1967, while he was still in high school. He attended more than 850 Grateful Dead concerts in his lifetime. Walton traveled with the band to Egypt for its 1978 performances at the Giza pyramid complex. To fellow Deadheads, Walton was fondly known as &quot;Grateful Red&quot; and the &quot;Big Red Deadhead&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest Deadhead&quot;. In 2001, Walton was inducted into The Grateful Dead Hall of Honor.

Walton wrote the liner notes for the Grateful Dead live albums &quot;Dave&#x27;s Picks Volume 5&quot; in 2013 and &quot;Dave&#x27;s Picks Volume 48&quot; in 2023, both of which feature concerts recorded at UCLA&#x27;s Pauley Pavilion during Walton&#x27;s tenure on the university&#x27;s basketball team. Walton narrated &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot;, an action sports documentary featuring Grateful Dead songs, which aired on ESPN in October 2020.

Members of the Grateful Dead and its spin-off group Dead &amp; Company paid tribute to Walton following his death. Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart wrote, &quot;Bill was my best friend, the best friend I ever had. He was an amazing person, singular, irreplaceable, giving, loving. His love for our music was beyond description. He called himself the luckiest man in the world but it was us who were lucky—to know him, to share the adventure with him. He was the biggest Deadhead in the world and used our music as the soundtrack to his life.&quot; Dead &amp; Company featured a memorial montage to Walton during a performance of &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot; at their May 30, 2024 concert at the Sphere in Paradise, Nevada.

===Health and views===
Walton&#x27;s ankle problems became so severe that he had both his ankles surgically fused. In 2009, he underwent an eight-hour spinal-fusion surgery. Two titanium rods and four four-inch bolts were inserted in his back. He could not walk to the hospital. After the successful surgery he was hospitalized for a week, and could not move freely for a year.
His saga of injury and failed rehabs was connected to the use of painkillers by the medical staff of the Trailblazers to keep players including Walton on court. Walton ended up suing team doctor Dr. Robert Cook for negligence in diagnosing and treating a foot injury suffered by Walton during the 1977–78 season. In a June 8, 2010, interview on &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot;, Walton admitted to contemplating suicide for a time due to the constant pain resulting from injuries sustained during his NBA career.

Walton&#x27;s political beliefs were known for being radical. During his time at UCLA, Walton was active in campus protests. He was famously arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest during his junior year at UCLA. Walton, who spoke at Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s memorial service and funeral, acknowledged spending time with Hoffman when he was a fugitive in the late 1970s. Walton was known as a vegetarian and a meditation practitioner.

===Death===
Walton died from colorectal cancer at his home in San Diego, on May 27, 2024, at the age of 71.

A moment of silence was held in Walton&#x27;s memory before Game 1 of the subsequent NBA Finals on June 6 at TD Garden between the Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks. Walton&#x27;s family was in attendance, and the Celtics players wore black shooting shirts bearing Walton&#x27;s name with a tie-dye background while their jerseys had a black band with his name on the shoulder. Celtics team staff wore pins with a similar Walton in tie-dye.

==In popular culture==
Walton had cameo appearances in the films &quot;88 and 1&quot;, &quot;Celtic Pride&quot;, &quot;Little Nicky&quot;, &quot;Forget Paris&quot; and &quot;Semi-Pro&quot;, and appeared as Sven the Wise in the 2011 Capital One Visigoth SportsNet commercials.

Walton appeared in the 1984 motion picture &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. He lent his voice to video games &quot;NBA 2K5&quot; and &quot;NBA ShootOut 2004&quot;.

Walton appeared in the premiere of the third season in the reality TV show &quot;Shark Tank&quot; on January 20, 2012, where he helped to sell the &quot;Clean Bottle&quot;, a water bottle that unscrews at both ends for easier cleaning.

Walton appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Swish Swish&quot; by pop musician Katy Perry featuring rapper Nicki Minaj. He played a color commentator alongside fellow broadcaster Rich Eisen.

<doc id="345102" wikidata="Q1571221" url="?curid=345102" title="Charlie Hennigan">
<text>Charles Taylor Hennigan Sr. (March 19, 1935 – December 20, 2017) was an American professional football player who was a wide receiver with the former Houston Oilers of the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the Northwestern State Demons. A five-time AFL All-Star, he was named to the AFL All-Time Team.

==Football career==

Hennigan attended LSU on a track scholarship but wanted to play football. He therefore transferred to Northwestern State University (then Northwestern State College) in Natchitoches, Louisiana, where he became the star of the team. In 1960, he joined the American Football League&#x27;s Houston Oilers in the team&#x27;s first year of operation. Prior to joining the Oilers, he had taught high school biology at a salary of some $2,700 per year. He kept his teacher pay stub in his helmet to remind him that he must succeed in pro athletics.

Hennigan scored the first touchdown in Oilers history, catching a 43-yard touchdown pass from George Blanda in the first quarter against the Oakland Raiders. That year, he caught 44 passes for 722 yards, averaging 16.4 yard per catch. He had six touchdowns. In the 1960 American Football League Championship Game, he caught four passes for 71 yards as the Oilers prevailed 24–16 to win the inaugural AFL title over the Los Angeles Chargers. After a promising rookie season, in 1961, he started all 14 games and established himself as a superstar in the AFL by setting a single-season record with 1,746 yards receiving along with 12 touchdowns. His record stood for 34 years until it was surpassed by both Jerry Rice and Isaac Bruce in 1995. In October alone, he had 822 receiving yards, the most in a single calendar month. One of quarterback George Blanda’s main targets, Hennigan was the second professional football player to catch more than a hundred passes in a single season (101 in 1964, an AFL record) and to twice gain over 1,500 yards receiving (1961 and 1964). He holds the all-time records for most games in a season with over 200 yards receiving with three, and most games in a season with over 100 yards receiving with 11. Hennigan had the All-time AFL single game record of 272 yards receiving, against the Boston Patriots on October 13, 1961. The 13 passes caught in the game is tied for the most ever in the AFL, shared with Lance Alworth, Lionel Taylor, and Sid Blanks. In the 1961 American Football League Championship Game, he had five catches for 43 yards as the Oilers prevailed for their second and final AFL title.

On January 19, 1962, Minden observed &quot;Charlie Hennigan&quot; Day. Then State Senator Harold Montgomery, State Representative, Parey Branton, Mayor Frank T. Norman, and other local officials presented Hennigan with a signed document of his accomplishments. A luncheon and evening meal were served in his honor. The event was postponed because of hazardous weather the previous week. That year, he had 54 catches for 867 yards with eight touchdowns. In the AFL title game, he had three catches for 37 yards, but the Oilers lost in double overtime to the Dallas Texans.

Hennigan was selected by his peers as a Sporting News AFL All-League offensive end in 1961, 1962, and 1964. He was an American Football League Eastern Division All-Star five straight years (1961 - 1965), and retired after the 1966 season. He was selected to the All-Time All-AFL Second Team.

The Professional Football Researchers Association named Hennigan to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2014.

He was named to the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1978.

On April 6, 2002, Hennigan, then a Democrat but a registered Independent as of 2014, ran in a special election for Place 8 on the Caddo Parish Commission, his parish&#x27;s governing body. He was defeated by Republican Michael Long, 2,139 votes (74.9 percent) to 716 ballots (25.1 percent).

On December 20, 2017, Hennigan died at the age of 82.

<doc id="345103" wikidata="Q336344" url="?curid=345103" title="Cosmo Gordon Lang">
<text>William Cosmo Gordon Lang, 1st Baron Lang of Lambeth, (31 October 1864 – 5 December 1945) was a Scottish Anglican prelate who served as Archbishop of York (1908–1928) and Archbishop of Canterbury (1928–1942). His elevation to Archbishop of York, within 18 years of his ordination, was the most rapid in modern Church of England history. As Archbishop of Canterbury during the abdication crisis of 1936, he took a strong moral stance, his comments in a subsequent broadcast being widely condemned as uncharitable towards the departed king.

The son of a Scots Presbyterian minister, Lang abandoned the prospect of a legal and political career to train for the Anglican priesthood. Beginning in 1890, his early ministry was served in slum parishes in Leeds and Portsmouth, except for brief service as Vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in Oxford. In 1901 he was appointed suffragan Bishop of Stepney in London, where he continued his work among the poor. He also served as a canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London.

In 1908 Lang was nominated as Archbishop of York, despite his relatively junior status as a suffragan rather than a diocesan bishop. His religious stance was broadly Anglo-Catholic, tempered by the liberal Anglo-Catholicism advocated in the &quot;Lux Mundi&quot; essays. He consequently entered the House of Lords as a Lord Spiritual and caused consternation in traditionalist circles by speaking and voting against the Lords&#x27; proposal to reject David Lloyd George&#x27;s 1909 &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;. This radicalism was not maintained in subsequent years. At the start of the First World War, Lang was heavily criticised for a speech in which he spoke sympathetically of the German Emperor. This troubled him greatly and may have contributed to the rapid ageing which affected his appearance during the war years. After the war he began to promote church unity and at the 1920 Lambeth Conference was responsible for the Church&#x27;s Appeal to All Christian People. As Archbishop of York he supported controversial proposals for the 1928 revision of the Book of Common Prayer but, after acceding to Canterbury, he took no practical steps to resolve this issue.

Lang became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1928. He presided over the 1930 Lambeth Conference, which gave limited church approval to the use of contraception. After denouncing the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and strongly condemning European antisemitism, Lang later supported the appeasement policies of the British government. In May 1937 he presided over the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. On retirement in 1942 Lang was raised to the peerage as Baron Lang of Lambeth and continued to attend and speak in House of Lords debates until his death in 1945. Lang himself believed that he had not lived up to his own high standards. Others have praised his qualities of industry, his efficiency and his commitment to his calling.

==Early life==

===Childhood and family===
Cosmo Gordon Lang was born in 1864 at the manse in Fyvie, Aberdeenshire, the third son of the local Church of Scotland minister, John Marshall Lang, and his wife Hannah Agnes Lang. Cosmo was baptised at Fyvie church by a neighbouring minister, the name &quot;William&quot; being added inadvertently to his given names, perhaps because the local laird was called William Cosmo Gordon. The additional name was rarely used subsequently. In January 1865 the family moved to Glasgow on John Lang&#x27;s appointment as a minister in the Anderston district. Subsequent moves followed: in 1868 to Morningside, Edinburgh and, in 1873, back to Glasgow when John Lang was appointed minister to the historic Barony Church.

Among Cosmo&#x27;s brothers were Marshall Buchanan Lang, who followed his father into the Church of Scotland, eventually serving as its Moderator in 1935; and Norman Macleod Lang, who served the Church of England as Bishop suffragan of Leicester.

In Glasgow, Lang attended the Park School, a day establishment where he won a prize for an essay on English literature and played the occasional game of football; otherwise, he recorded, &quot;I was never greatly interested in [the school&#x27;s] proceedings.&quot; Holidays were spent in different parts of Scotland, most notably in Argyll to which, later in life, Lang would frequently return. In 1878, at the age of 14, Lang sat and passed his matriculation examinations. Despite his youth, he began his studies at the University of Glasgow later that year.

===University of Glasgow===

At the university Lang&#x27;s tutors included some of Scotland&#x27;s leading academics: the Greek scholar Richard Claverhouse Jebb, the physicist William Thomson (who was later created Lord Kelvin) and the philosopher Edward Caird. Long afterwards Lang commented on the inability of some of these eminent figures to handle &quot;the Scottish boors who formed a large part of their classes&quot;. Lang was most strongly influenced by Caird, who gave the boy&#x27;s mind &quot;its first real awakening&quot;. Lang recalled how, in a revelation as he was passing through Kelvingrove Park, he expressed aloud his sudden conviction that: &quot;The Universe is one and its Unity and Ultimate Reality is God!&quot; He acknowledged that his greatest failure at the university was his inability to make any progress in his understanding of mathematics, &quot;to me, then and always, unintelligible&quot;.

In 1881 Lang made his first trip outside Scotland, to London where he heard the theologian and orator Henry Parry Liddon preach in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He also heard William Ewart Gladstone and Joseph Chamberlain debating in the House of Commons. Later that year he travelled to Cambridge to stay with a friend who was studying there. A visit to King&#x27;s College Chapel persuaded Lang that he should study at the college; the following January he sat and passed the entrance examination. When he discovered that as part of his degree studies he would be examined in mathematics, his enthusiasm disappeared. Instead, he applied to Balliol College, Oxford, and was accepted. In mid-1882 he ended his studies at Glasgow with a Master of Arts degree, and was awarded prizes for essays on politics and church history.

===Oxford===
Lang started at Balliol in October 1882. In his first term he successfully sat for the Brackenbury Scholarship, described by his biographer John Gilbert Lockhart as &quot;the Blue Ribbon of history scholarship at any University of the British Isles&quot;. In February 1883 his first speech at the Oxford Union, against the disestablishment of the Church of Scotland, was warmly received; the chairman likened his oratory to that of the Ancient Greek statesman, Demosthenes. He became the Union&#x27;s president in the Trinity term of 1883, and the following year was a co-founder of the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS).

Although Lang considered himself forward-thinking, he joined and became secretary of the Canning Club, the university&#x27;s principal Conservative society. His contemporary Robert Cecil recorded that Lang&#x27;s &quot;progressive&quot; opinions were somewhat frowned upon by traditional Tories, who nevertheless respected his ability. Lang later assisted in the founding of the University settlement of Toynbee Hall, a mission to help the poor in the East End of London. He had been first drawn to this work in 1883, after listening to a sermon in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Oxford, by Samuel Augustus Barnett, Vicar of St Jude&#x27;s, Whitechapel. Barnett became the settlement&#x27;s first leader, while Lang became one of its first undergraduate secretaries. He spent so much time on these duties that he was chided by the Master of Balliol, Benjamin Jowett, for neglecting his studies. In 1886 Lang graduated with first-class honours in History; in October he failed to secure a Fellowship of All Souls College, blaming his poor early scholastic training in Glasgow.

===Towards ordination===
Lang&#x27;s career ambition from early in life was to practise law, enter politics and then take office in some future Conservative administration. In 1887 he began his studies for the English Bar, working in the London chambers of W.S. Robson, a future Attorney-General, whose &quot;vehement radicalism was an admirable stimulus and corrective to [Lang&#x27;s] liberal Conservatism&quot;. During these years Lang was largely aloof from religion, but continued churchgoing out of what he termed &quot;hereditary respect&quot;. He attended services at the nonconformist City Temple church and sometimes went to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Of his life at that time he said: &quot;I must confess that I played sometimes with those external temptations that our Christian London flaunts in the face of its young men.&quot;

In October 1888 Lang was elected to an All Souls Fellowship, and began to divide his time between London and Oxford. Some of his Oxford friends were training for ordination and Lang was often drawn into their discussions. Eventually the question entered Lang&#x27;s mind: &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t &quot;you&quot; be ordained?&quot; The thought persisted, and one Sunday evening in early 1889, after a visit to the theological college at Cuddesdon in Oxfordshire, Lang attended evening service at Cuddesdon parish church. By his own account, during the sermon he was gripped by &quot;a masterful inward voice&quot; which told him &quot;You are wanted. You are called. You must obey.&quot; He immediately severed his connection with the Bar, renounced his political ambitions and applied for a place at Cuddesdon College. With the help of an All Souls contact, the essential step of his confirmation into the Church of England was supervised by the Bishop of Lincoln. Lang&#x27;s decision to become an Anglican and seek ordination disappointed his Presbyterian father, who nevertheless wrote to his son: &quot;What you think, prayerfully and solemnly, you ought to do – you must do – we will accept.&quot;

==Early ministry==

===Leeds===

After a year&#x27;s study at Cuddesdon, Lang was ordained as deacon. He rejected an offer of the chaplaincy of All Souls as he wanted to be &quot;up and doing&quot; in a tough parish. Lang identified with the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England, in part, he admitted, as a reaction against his evangelical upbringing in the Church of Scotland. His sympathies lay with the progressive wing of Anglo-Catholicism represented by the &quot;Lux Mundi&quot; essays, published in 1888 by a group of forward-looking Oxford theologians. Among these was Edward Stuart Talbot, Warden of Keble, who in 1888 had become Vicar of Leeds Parish Church. Talbot had contributed the essay entitled &quot;The Preparation for History in Christ&quot; in &quot;Lux Mundi&quot;. On ordination Lang eagerly accepted the offer of a curacy under Talbot, and arrived in Leeds in late 1890.

Leeds Parish Church, rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1841 after an elaborate ceremony, was of almost cathedral size, the centre of a huge parish ministered by many curates. Lang&#x27;s district was the Kirkgate, one of the poorest areas, many of whose 2,000 inhabitants were prostitutes. Lang and his fellow curates fashioned a clergy house from a derelict public house. He later moved next door, into a condemned property which became his home for his remaining service in Leeds. In addition to his normal parish duties, Lang acted temporarily as Principal of the Clergy School, was chaplain to Leeds Infirmary, and took charge of a men&#x27;s club of around a hundred members. On 24 May 1891 he was ordained to full priesthood.

Lang continued to visit Oxford when time allowed and on a visit to All Souls in June 1893 he was offered the post of Dean of Divinity at Magdalen College. Other offers were open to him; the Bishop of Newcastle wished to appoint him vicar of the cathedral church in Newcastle and Benjamin Jowett wished him to return to Balliol as a tutor in theology. Lang chose Magdalen; the idea of being in charge of young men who might in the future achieve positions of responsibility was attractive to him and, in October 1893, with many regrets, he left Leeds.

===Magdalen College===

As Magdalen&#x27;s Dean of Divinity (college chaplain), Lang had pastoral duties with the college&#x27;s undergraduates and responsibility for the chapel and its choir. Lang was delighted with this latter obligation; his concern for the purity of the choir&#x27;s sound led him to request that visitors &quot;join in the service silently&quot;. In 1894 Lang was asked to add to his workload by acting as Vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, where John Henry Newman had begun his Oxford ministry in 1828. The church had almost ceased to function when Lang took it over, but he revived regular services, chose preachers with care and slowly rebuilt the congregation. In December 1895 he was offered the post of Vicar of Portsea, a large parish within Portsmouth on the south coast, but he was not ready to leave Oxford and refused. Some months later he had further thoughts; the strain of his dual appointment in Oxford was beginning to tell and, he claimed, &quot;the thought of this great parish [of Portsea] and work going a-begging troubled my conscience.&quot; After discovering that the Portsea offer was still open, he decided to accept, though with some misgiving.

===Portsea===

Portsea, covering much of the town of Portsmouth, was a dockside parish of around 40,000 inhabitants with a mixture of housing ranging from neat terraces to squalid slums. The large, recently rebuilt St Mary&#x27;s church held more than 2,000 people. Lang arrived in June 1896 to lead a team of more than a dozen curates serving the five districts of the parish. He quickly resumed the kind of urban parish work he had carried out in Leeds; he founded a Sunday afternoon men&#x27;s conference with 300 men, and supervised the construction of a large conference hall as a centre for parish activities. He also pioneered the establishment of parochial church councils long before they were given legal status in 1919. Outside his normal parish duties, Lang served as chaplain to the local prison, and became acting chaplain to the 2nd Hampshire Royal Artillery Volunteer Corps.

Lang&#x27;s relationship with his curates was generally formal. They were aware of his ambition and felt that he sometimes spent too much time on his outside interests such as his All Souls Fellowship, but were nevertheless impressed by his efficiency and his powers of oratory. The Church historian Adrian Hastings singles out Portsea under Lang as an example of &quot;extremely disciplined pastoral professionalism&quot;. Lang may have realised that he was destined for high office; he is reported to have practised the signature &quot;Cosmo Cantuar&quot; during a relaxed discussion with his curates (&quot;Cantuar&quot; is part of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s formal signature). In January 1898 he was invited by Queen Victoria to preach at Osborne House, her Isle of Wight home. Afterwards he talked with the Queen who, Lang records, suggested that he should marry. Lang replied that he could not afford to as his curates cost too much. He added: &quot;If a curate proves unsatisfactory I can get rid of him. A wife is a fixture.&quot; He was summoned on several more occasions and in the following January was appointed an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen. These visits to Osborne were the start of a close association with the Royal Family which lasted for the rest of Lang&#x27;s life. As one of the Queen&#x27;s chaplains, he assisted in the funeral arrangements after her death in January 1901.

==Bishop and canon==

In March 1901 Lang was appointed suffragan Bishop of Stepney and a canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. These appointments reflected his growing reputation and recognised his successful ministry in working-class parishes. He was consecrated bishop by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, on 1 May; his time would subsequently be divided between his work in the Stepney region and his duties at St Paul&#x27;s.
The University of Oxford honoured him with the degree of Doctor of Divinity in late May 1901.

===Stepney===

Lang&#x27;s region of Stepney within the Diocese of London extended over the whole area generally known as London&#x27;s East End, with two million people in more than 200 parishes. Almost all were poor, and housed in overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Lang knew something of the area from his undergraduate activities at Toynbee Hall, and his conscience was troubled by the squalor that he saw as he travelled around the district, usually by bus and tram.

Lang&#x27;s liberal conservatism enabled him to associate easily with Socialist leaders such as Will Crooks and George Lansbury, successive mayors of Poplar; he was responsible for bringing the latter back to regular communion in the Church. In 1905 he and Lansbury joined the Central London Unemployed Body, set up by the government to tackle the region&#x27;s unemployment problems. That same year Lang took as his personal assistant a young Cambridge graduate and clergyman&#x27;s son, Dick Sheppard, who became a close friend and confidante. Sheppard was eventually ordained, becoming a radical clergyman and founder of the Peace Pledge Union. Lang believed that socialism was a growing force in British life, and at a Church Congress in Great Yarmouth in 1907 he speculated on how the Church should respond to this. His remarks reached &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which warned that modern socialism was often equated with unrest, that &quot;the cry of the demagogue is in the air&quot; and that the Church should not heed this cry.

Much of the work in the district was supported by the East London Church Fund, established in 1880 to provide for additional clergy and lay workers in the poorest districts. Lang preached in wealthier parishes throughout Southern England, and urged his listeners to contribute to the Fund. He resumed his ministry to the army when, in 1907, he was appointed Honorary Chaplain to the City of London Imperial Yeomanry (Rough Riders). He became chairman of the Church of England Men&#x27;s Society (CEMS), which had been founded in 1899 by the merger of numerous organisations doing the same work. Initially he found it &quot;a very sickly infant&quot;, but under his leadership it expanded rapidly, and soon had over 20,000 members in 600 branches. Later he became critical of the Church&#x27;s failure to use this movement effectively, calling it one of the Church&#x27;s lost opportunities.

===St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral===
Lang&#x27;s appointment as a canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral required him to spend three months annually as the canon in residence, with administrative and preaching duties. Following his appointment as canon, he was also appointed treasurer of the cathedral. His preaching on Sunday afternoons caught the attention of William Temple, Lang&#x27;s future successor at both York and Canterbury, who was then an undergraduate at Oxford. Temple observed that, in contrast to the Bishop of London&#x27;s sermons, listening to Lang brought on an intellectual rather than emotional pleasure: &quot;I can remember all his points, just because their connexion is inevitable... And for me, there is no doubt that this is the more edifying by far.&quot; Lang was a member of the cathedral&#x27;s governing body, the Dean and Chapter, and was responsible for the organisation of special occasions, such as the service of thanksgiving for King Edward VII&#x27;s recovery from appendicitis in July 1902.

==Archbishop of York==
===Appointment===

In late 1908 Lang was informed of his election as Bishop of Montreal. Letters from the Governor General of Canada and the Canadian High Commissioner urged him to accept, but the Archbishop of Canterbury asked him to refuse. A few weeks later a letter from H. H. Asquith, the prime minister, informed Lang that he had been nominated Archbishop of York. Lang was only 44 years old, and had no experience as a diocesan bishop. On the issue of age, the &quot;Church Times&quot; believed that Asquith deliberately recommended the youngest bishop available, after strong political lobbying for the appointment of the elderly Bishop of Hereford, John Percival. Such a promotion for a suffragan, and within so short a period after ordination, was without recent precedent in the Church of England. Lang&#x27;s friend Hensley Henson, a future Bishop of Durham, wrote: &quot;I am, of course, surprised that you go to an archbishopric[...] But you are too meteoric for precedent.&quot; The appointment was generally well received, although the Protestant Truth Society sought in vain to prevent its confirmation. Strong opponents of Anglo-Catholic practices, they maintained that as Bishop of Stepney Lang had &quot;connived at and encouraged flagrant breaking of the law relating to church ritual&quot;.

===First years===

Lang&#x27;s election to York was confirmed on 20 January and he was enthroned at York Minster on 25 January 1909. In 18 years since ordination he had risen to the second-highest position in the Church of England. In addition to his diocesan responsibilities for York itself, he became head of the entire Northern Province, and a member of the House of Lords. Believing that the Diocese of York was too large, he proposed reducing it by forming a new Diocese of Sheffield, which after several years&#x27; work was inaugurated in 1914. In the years following his appointment, Lang spoke out on a range of social and economic issues, and in support of improved working conditions. After taking his seat in the House of Lords in February 1909, he made his maiden speech in November in the debate on the controversial People&#x27;s Budget, advising the Lords against their intention to reject this measure. He cast his first Lords vote against rejection, because he was &quot;deeply convinced of the unwisdom of the course the Lords proposed to take&quot;. Although his speech was received with respect, Lang&#x27;s stance was politely reproved by the leading Conservative peer Lord Curzon.

Despite this socially progressive stance, Lang&#x27;s political instincts remained conservative. He voted against the 1914 Irish Home Rule Bill and opposed liberalisation of the divorce laws. After playing a prominent role in King George V&#x27;s coronation in 1911, Lang became increasingly close to the Royal Family, an association which drew the comment that he was &quot;more courtier than cleric&quot;. His love of ceremony, and concern for how an archbishop should look and live, began to obscure other aspects of his ministry; rather than assuming the role of the people&#x27;s prelate he began, in the words of his biographer Alan Wilkinson, to act as a &quot;prince of the church&quot;.

===First World War===
When war broke out in August 1914, Lang concluded that the conflict was righteous, and that younger clergy should be encouraged to serve as military chaplains, although it was not their duty to fight. He thereafter was active in recruiting campaigns throughout his province. At a meeting in York in November 1914 he caused offence when he spoke out against excessive anti-German propaganda, and recalled a &quot;sacred memory&quot; of the Kaiser kneeling with King Edward VII at the bier of Queen Victoria. These remarks, perceived as pro-German, produced what Lang termed &quot;a perfect hail of denunciation&quot;. The strain of this period, coupled with the onset of alopecia, drastically altered Lang&#x27;s relatively youthful appearance to that of a bald and elderly-looking man. His friends were shocked; the king, meeting him on the Royal train, apparently burst into guffaws of laughter.

Public hostility against Lang was slow to subside, re-emerging from time to time throughout the war. Lang continued his contribution to the war effort, paying visits to the Grand Fleet and to the Western Front. He applied all his organisational skills to the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s National Mission of Repentance and Hope, an initiative designed to renew Christian faith nationwide, but it failed to make a significant impact.

As a result of the Battle of Jerusalem of December 1917, the British Empire&#x27;s Egyptian Expeditionary Force captured the Holy City, bringing it under Christian control for the first time since the Crusades. As Prelate of the Venerable Order of Saint John, Lang led a service of celebration on 11 January 1918 at the Order&#x27;s Grand Priory Church, Clerkenwell. He explained that it was 917 years since the Order&#x27;s hospital had been founded in Jerusalem, and 730 years since they were driven out by Saladin. &quot;London is the city of the Empire&#x27;s commerce, but Jerusalem is the city of the soul, and it is particularly fitting that British Armies should have delivered it out of the hands of the infidel.&quot;

Early in 1918, at the invitation of the Episcopal Church of the United States, he made a goodwill visit to America, praising the extent and willingness of America&#x27;s participation in the war. The &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; called this &quot;one of the most moving and memorable visits ever paid by an Englishman [&quot;sic&quot;] to the United States&quot;.

===Post-war years===

After the war, Lang&#x27;s primary cause was that of church unity. In 1920, as chairman of the Reunion Committee at the Sixth Lambeth Conference, he promoted an &quot;Appeal to all Christian People&quot;, described by Hastings as &quot;one of the rare historical documents that does not get forgotten with the years&quot;. It was unanimously adopted as the Conference&#x27;s Resolution 9, and ended: &quot;We[...] ask that all should unite in a new and great endeavour to recover and to manifest to the world the unity of the Body of Christ for which He prayed.&quot; Despite initial warmth from the English Free Churches, little could be achieved in terms of practical union between episcopal and non-episcopal churches, and the initiative was allowed to lapse. Historically, the Appeal is considered the starting-point for the more successful ecumenical efforts of later generations.

Lang was supportive of the Malines Conversations of 1921–26, though not directly involved. These were informal meetings between leading British Anglo-Catholics and reform-minded European Roman Catholics, exploring the possibility of reuniting the Anglican and Roman communions. Although the discussions had the blessing of Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, many Anglican evangelicals were alarmed by them. Ultimately, the talks foundered on the entrenched opposition of the Catholic ultramontanes. A by-product of these conversations may have been the awakening of opposition to the revision of the Anglican Prayer Book. The focus of this revision, which Lang supported, was to make concessions to Anglo-Catholic rituals and practices in the Anglican service. The new Prayer Book was overwhelmingly approved by the Church&#x27;s main legislative body, the Church Assembly, and by the House of Lords. Partly through the advocacy of the fervently evangelical Home Secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, the revision was twice defeated in the House of Commons, in December 1927 by 238 votes to 205 and, in June 1928, by 266 to 220. Lang was deeply disappointed, writing that &quot;the gusts of Protestant convictions, suspicions, fears [and] prejudices swept through the House, and ultimately prevailed.&quot;

On 26 April 1923, George V awarded Lang the Royal Victorian Chain, an honour in the personal gift of the Sovereign After the marriage of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI) in 1923, Lang formed a friendship with his Duchess (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) which lasted for the rest of Lang&#x27;s life. In 1926, he baptised Princess Elizabeth (later Elizabeth II) in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace. In January 1927, Lang took centre-stage in the elaborate ceremonies which marked the 1,300th anniversary of the founding of York Minster.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==

===In office===

Archbishop Davidson resigned in July 1928, believed to have been the first Archbishop of Canterbury ever to retire voluntarily. On 26 July Lang was notified by the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, that he would be the successor; William Temple would succeed Lang at York. Lang was enthroned as the new Archbishop of Canterbury on 4 December 1928, the first bachelor to hold the appointment in 150 years. A contemporary &quot;Time&quot; magazine article described Lang as &quot;forthright and voluble&quot; and as looking &quot;like George Washington&quot;. Lang&#x27;s first three years at Canterbury were marked by intermittent illnesses, which required periods of convalescence away from his duties. After 1932, he enjoyed good health for the rest of his life.

Lang avoided continuation of the Prayer Book controversy of 1928 by allowing the parliamentary process to lapse. He then authorised a statement permitting use of the rejected Book locally if the parochial church council gave approval. The issue remained dormant for the rest of Lang&#x27;s tenure at Canterbury. He led the 1930 Lambeth Conference, where further progress was made in improving relations with the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Old Catholics, although again no agreement could be reached with the non-episcopal Free Churches. On an issue of greater concern to ordinary people, the Conference gave limited approval, for the first time, to the use of contraceptive devices, an issue in which Lang had no interest. Through the 1930s Lang continued to work for Church unity. In 1933 the Church of England assembly formed a Council on Foreign Relations and, in the following years, numerous exchange visits with Orthodox delegations took place, a process only halted by the outbreak of war. Lang&#x27;s 1939 visit to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is regarded as the high point of his ecumenical record. George Bell, Bishop of Chichester, maintained that no one in the Anglican Communion did more than Lang to promote the unity movement.

In 1937 the Oxford Conference on Church and Society, which later gave birth to the World Council of Churches, produced what was according to the church historian Adrian Hastings &quot;the most serious approach to the problems of society that the Church had yet managed&quot;, but without Lang&#x27;s close involvement. By this time Lang&#x27;s identification with the poor had largely vanished, as had his interest in social reform. In the Church Assembly his closest ally was the aristocratic Lord Hugh Cecil; Hastings maintains that the Church of England in the 1930s was controlled &quot;less by Lang and Temple in tandem than by Lang and Hugh Cecil&quot;. Lang got on well with Hewlett Johnson, the pro-communist priest who was appointed Dean of Canterbury in 1931.

===International and domestic politics===
Lang often spoke in the House of Lords about the treatment of Russian Christians in the Soviet Union. He also denounced the anti-semitic policies of the German government, and he took private steps to help European Jews. In 1938 he was instrumental in saving 60 rabbis from Burgenland, who would have been murdered by the Nazis had the archbishop not obtained them entry visas to England.

In 1933, having commented on the &quot;noble task&quot; of assisting India towards independence, he was appointed to the Joint Committee on the Indian Constitution. He condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935, appealing for medical supplies to be sent to the Abyssinian troops. As the threat of war increased later in the decade, Lang became a strong supporter of the government&#x27;s policy of appeasing the European dictators, declaring the Sunday after the Munich Agreement of September 1938 to be a day of thanksgivings for the &quot;sudden lifting of this cloud&quot;. Earlier that year, contrary to his former stance, he had supported the Anglo-Italian agreement to recognise the conquest of Abyssinia, because he believed that &quot;an increase of appeasement&quot; was necessary to avoid the threat of war. Lang also backed the government&#x27;s non-intervention policy in regard to the Spanish Civil War, saying that there were no clear issues that required the taking of sides. He described the bombing of Guernica by the Germans and the Italians, on 26 April 1937, as &quot;deplorable and shocking&quot;. In October 1937 Lang&#x27;s condemnation of Imperial Japanese Army actions in China provoked hostile scrutiny by the Japanese authorities of the Anglican Church in Japan, and caused some in that church&#x27;s leadership to publicly disassociate themselves from the Church of England.

On the domestic front, Lang supported campaigns for the abolition of the death penalty. He upheld the right of the Church to refuse the remarriage of divorced persons within its buildings, but he did not directly oppose A.P. Herbert&#x27;s Matrimonial Causes Bill of 1937, which liberalised the divorce laws – Lang believed &quot;it was no longer possible to impose the full Christian standard by law on a largely non-Christian population.&quot; He drew criticism for his opposition to the reform of the ancient tithe system, whereby many farmers paid a proportion of their income to the Church; in the subsequent &quot;Tithe Wars&quot;, demonstrators at Ashford, Kent ceremonially burned his effigy.
Near the end of his term in office Lang led a deputation from several church groups to the Ministry of Education, to present a five-point plan for the teaching of religion in state schools. These points were eventually embodied in the Education Act 1944.

===Abdication crisis===
Lang was responsible for drafting King George V&#x27;s silver jubilee broadcast message in 1935, and the King&#x27;s last two Christmas messages. This closeness to the throne was not maintained when the king died in January 1936 and was succeeded by his son, Edward VIII. The new king was wary of Lang, whom he had once admired. Edward now found Lang to be &quot;rather[...] accustomed to the company of princes and statesmen, more interested in the pursuit of prestige and power than the abstractions of the human soul&quot;.

Lang believed that, as Prince of Wales, Edward had not always been wise in his choice of friends and acquaintances, whose standards Lang was later to condemn as &quot;alien to all the best instincts and traditions of his people&quot;. The archbishop had been aware for some time of the King&#x27;s relationship with the American Wallis Simpson, then married to her second husband Ernest Simpson. In mid-1936 it became clear that the King intended to marry Simpson either before or shortly after his impending coronation, depending on the timing of her divorce from her husband. Lang agonised over whether he could, with good conscience, administer the Coronation Oath to the king in such circumstances, bearing in mind the Church&#x27;s teaching on marriage. He confided to his diary his hopes that circumstances might change, or that he might be able to persuade the King to reconsider his actions, but the King refused to meet him. Lang kept close contact with Queen Mary (the queen mother), Stanley Baldwin (the Prime Minister) and Alec Hardinge (the King&#x27;s Private Secretary). The king believed that Lang&#x27;s influence was strong, later recalling how from beginning to end he felt the archbishop&#x27;s &quot;shadowy, hovering presence&quot; in the background. The king&#x27;s view was accurate; Lang met with Baldwin on seven occasions during the crisis, an &quot;unusual&quot; frequency, and &quot;made the most of his opportunities&quot; to influence Baldwin into taking a firm line.

The matter became public knowledge on 2 December 1936 when Alfred Blunt, Bishop of Bradford, made an indirect comment on the King&#x27;s &quot;need for Divine Grace&quot;. By then the king had unalterably decided that he would abdicate rather than give up Wallis Simpson. All attempts to dissuade him failed, and on 11 December he gave up his throne in favour of his brother, George VI. Two days later Lang broadcast a speech, in which he said: &quot;From God he received a high and sacred trust. Yet by his own will he has[...] surrendered the trust.&quot; The king&#x27;s motive had been &quot;a craving for private happiness&quot; that he had sought &quot;in a manner inconsistent with the Christian principles of marriage&quot;. The speech was widely condemned for its lack of charity towards the departed king and provoked the writer Gerald Bullett to publish a satirical punning rhyme:
Lang&#x27;s most recent biographer considers that his broadcast was &quot;arguably the biggest mistake of his primacy.&quot; The volume, and vehemence, of the reaction were immense. Alan Don, Lang&#x27;s secretary and chaplain, wrote in his diary entry for Tuesday 15 December; &quot;A perfect deluge of letters – the majority abusive and even vituperative&quot;, and went as far as to venture a rare criticism of his master; &quot;C. C. was a little unfair to the poor King. I wish [he] had submitted his address to one of us beforehand but[...] he trusted his own judgement – which[...] [was] slightly at fault&quot;.

Lang did not disguise his relief that the crisis was over. He wrote of George VI: &quot;I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response.&quot; On 12 May 1937, Lang crowned George VI with full pomp in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. &quot;Time&quot; magazine recorded: &quot;All through the three-hour ceremony, the most important person there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&amp;-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England.&quot; Supposedly the archbishop fumbled with the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: &quot;I can only be thankful to God&#x27;s over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten.&quot; He also said of the Coronation: &quot;It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. Once I saw it was going well, I enjoyed every minute.&quot; &quot;Thank God that is over!&quot; said his chaplain, as they got into the car to leave. &quot;Lumley, how can you say such a thing!&quot; cried the archbishop. &quot;I only wish it was beginning over again.&quot;

===War===

When the Second World War began in September 1939, Lang saw his main duty as the preservation of spiritual values during what he deemed to be an honourable conflict. He opposed strategies such as indiscriminate bombing, and on 21 December 1940, in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; signed jointly with Temple and Cardinal Hinsley, Lang expressed support for the pope&#x27;s Five Peace Points initiative. Lang was sympathetic to the Sword of the Spirit campaign, founded by Hinsley in 1940 to combat anti-democratic tendencies among Catholics. In May 1941 Lambeth Palace, Lang&#x27;s London home, was hit by bombs and made uninhabitable.

After Germany&#x27;s attack on Russia in June 1941, Lang said that the Russians must now be regarded as allies, without forgetting or condoning the excesses of the past. His relations with Winston Churchill, prime minister since May 1940, were difficult because &quot;he [Churchill] knows nothing about the Church, its life, its needs or its personnel&quot;. There was therefore &quot;uncertainty as to what motives or how much knowledge may determine his decisions [on Church matters]&quot;.

==Retirement and death==

During 1941 Lang considered retirement. His main concern was that a Lambeth Conference – &quot;perhaps the most fateful Lambeth Conference ever held&quot; – would need to be called soon after the war. Lang felt that he would be too old to lead it and that he should make way for a younger man, preferably William Temple. On 27 November he informed the prime minister, Winston Churchill, of his decision to retire on 31 March 1942. His last official act in office, on 28 March, was the confirmation of Princess Elizabeth.

On his retirement Lang was raised to the peerage as Baron Lang of Lambeth, of Lambeth in the County of Surrey. He thus remained in the House of Lords, where he attended regularly and contributed to debates. He worried about money, despite a pension, a large grace and favour house at Kew, and some generous cash gifts from well-wishers. In 1943 he spoke in the House of Lords in support of the Beveridge Report on social insurance, and on 9 February 1944 he reiterated his earlier opposition to obliteration bombing. In October 1944 Lang was greatly distressed by the sudden death of William Temple, his successor at Canterbury, writing: &quot;I don&#x27;t like to think of the loss to the Church and Nation... But &#x27;God knows and God reigns&#x27;.&quot;
On 5 December 1945 Lang was due to speak in a Lords debate on conditions in Central Europe. On his way to Kew Gardens station to catch the London train, he collapsed and was taken to hospital, but was found to be dead on arrival. A post-mortem attributed the death to heart failure. In paying tribute the following day, Lord Addison said that Lang was &quot;not only a great cleric but a great man... we have lost in him a Father in God.&quot; His body was cremated and the ashes taken to the Chapel of St Stephen Martyr, a side chapel at Canterbury Cathedral.

The probate value of Lang&#x27;s estate was £29 541 (approximately £ in 2025).

==Legacy==

Although Lang was a bishop in England for longer than anyone else in the twentieth century, Hastings says that &quot;of no other is it so hard to address his true significance&quot;. His biographer George Moyser said, &quot;His lasting significance is questionable. He was immensely industrious, an exceptional administrator, and was well-connected to leading politicians and aristocrats. But his accomplishments as Archbishop of Canterbury were modest.&quot;

According to Lockhart he was a complex character in whom &quot;a jangle of warring personalities... never reached agreement among themselves.&quot; Lockhart writes that while Lang&#x27;s many years of high office saw progress in the cause of Christian reunion, the mark he left on the Church was relatively small; many believed it could have been larger and deeper. While Lang&#x27;s oratorical and administrative gifts were beyond doubt, Hastings nevertheless claims that as Archbishop of Canterbury, Lang displayed no effective leadership or guidance, turning away from reform and content to be the &quot;final sentinel to the &quot;ancien régime&quot;&quot;. Wilkinson says that Lang dealt conscientiously with problems as they arose, but without any overall strategy.

In Hastings&#x27;s view, Lang was probably more sympathetic to Rome than any other Church of England archbishop of modern times, responsible for a discreet catholicisation of the Church of England&#x27;s practices. A small outward indication of this was his decision to use a cassock as everyday dress and to wear a mitre on formal occasions, the first archbishop since the English Reformation to do so. Lang believed that in relation to the supreme truths of the church, rituals and dress were of small account, but that if people&#x27;s worship was assisted by such customs they should be allowed.

Despite Lang&#x27;s long involvement with the poorest of society, after becoming Archbishop of York he increasingly detached himself from everyday life. The historian Tom Buchanan wrote that Lang&#x27;s sympathy with ordinary people was replaced by &quot;an upper class affectation and a delight in the high society in which his office allowed him to move&quot;. No archbishop has been as close as Lang to the Royal Family; a Channel Four television history of the British monarchy maintained that Lang &quot;held a view of Christianity in which the monarchy, rather than the cross, stood centre stage as the symbol of the nation&#x27;s faith&quot;. Successive generations of the Royal Family considered him their friend and honoured him. King George V appointed him to the largely ceremonial post of Lord High Almoner, and after the 1937 Coronation George VI created him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO), a rare honour which, like the Royal Victorian Chain, lay in the private gift of the Sovereign. A friend, commenting on the transformation of Lang&#x27;s perspective, said of him: &quot;He might have been Cardinal Wolsey or St Francis of Assisi, and he chose to be Cardinal Wolsey.&quot;

Lang also received numerous honorary doctorates from British universities. His portrait was painted many times; after sitting for Sir William Orpen in 1924, Lang reportedly remarked to Bishop Hensley Henson of Durham that the portrait showed him as &quot;proud, prelatical and pompous&quot;. Henson&#x27;s recorded reply was &quot;To which of these epithets does Your Grace take exception?&quot;

At an early stage in his priesthood Lang decided to lead a celibate life. He had no objection to the institution of marriage, but felt that his own work would be hindered by domesticity. However, he enjoyed the company of women and confessed in 1928, after a visit to the Rowntree&#x27;s chocolate factory, that the sight of the girls there had &quot;stirred up all the instincts of my youth... very little subdued by the passage of years&quot;.

George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester who had earlier praised Lang&#x27;s work for church unity, said that Lang&#x27;s failure to take a lead after the Prayer Book rejection of 1928 meant that the Church of England had been unable to revise its forms of worship or take any effective control of its own affairs. Others have argued that Lang&#x27;s &quot;laissez-faire&quot; approach to the Prayer Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of Faith, or marked his primacy with a great historical act, he had failed to live up to his own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.
==Bibliography==

Lang wrote several books, including a novel of the Jacobite rising of 1745. This had its origins in stories told by Lang to the Magdalen College choirboys during his tenure as Magdalen&#x27;s Dean of Divinity.

<text>Danni Ashe (and early in her career sometimes as Danielle Ashe; born January 16, 1968) is a retired American nude model, former erotic dancer and web developer who is the founder and former CEO of &quot;Danni&#x27;s Hard Drive&quot;, a popular adult web site from the 90&#x27;s. She started her adult Internet site in 1995. She has been an industry advocate and testified before a government panel.

==Career==
===Early years===
Ashe was born in Beaufort, South Carolina, United States. Her naturally large breasts (cup size 32FF) contributed to her popularity as an adult performer.

Ashe began working as a stripper in Seattle, Washington. Never finishing high school, she started stripping at the age of seventeen using a fake ID. In an interview, Ashe once explained her career choice: &quot;I guess I&#x27;m an exhibitionist. But that&#x27;s not quite true. Part of the reason is that I developed huge breasts at an early age and breasts are a very sexualized thing. At an early age, I was getting a lot of sexualized attention. Eventually, I just felt that stripping kind of put all that stuff out on the table.&quot;

After about five years of working in Seattle clubs, Ashe moved to Los Angeles, California and began modeling for men&#x27;s magazines and soft-core pornographic videos. She eventually worked as an exotic dancer in various strip clubs throughout the United States as a featured performer. This resulted in an incident in a technically non-nude club in Jacksonville, Florida. In interviews, Ashe has alleged that the club&#x27;s owner and its manager persuaded her to perform a topless dance, and encouraged her to sell softcore videos of herself at the club. Ashe was subsequently arrested. Ashe pleaded guilty to &quot;prohibited conduct&quot; and was fined $50. Neither the club nor her agent helped her through this incident. This unpleasant experience marked a turning point in her career; Ashe never again performed as a stripper, seeking instead to work in an area where she would have more control.

===Internet===
Her first online activity was confined to Usenet newsgroups during late 1994 and early 1995. In the spring of 1995, she decided to create her own website when her husband – then a senior vice president of the Landmark theater franchise – showed her his company&#x27;s new website. When she could not find anyone competent to help her design her own site as she had envisioned it, Ashe read &quot;The HTML Manual of Style&quot; and Nicholas Negroponte&#x27;s &quot;Being Digital&quot; during a vacation. On her return, she created the &quot;Danni.com&quot; (a.k.a. Danni&#x27;s Hard Drive) website in two weeks.

The site was launched in July 1995 and contained content exclusive to her. Ashe announced the website to her friends prior to traveling to New York City with her husband. News of the site spread rapidly and hours later when she reached the hotel in Manhattan, Ashe had a message from her ISP stating that the volume of traffic her site received had overloaded their servers and caused their system to shut down. &quot;Danni.com&quot; was moved to its own server, which became famous for having a &quot;site working&quot; light that never went out. Ashe jokingly described her server as a &quot;hot box&quot;, and when she started charging a fee for access to the site, she named the members&#x27; area &quot;The HotBox&quot;.

By 2001, the website had made a profit of $6.5 million the previous year, was projected to make $8 million that year, and was estimated to be worth US$30 million. She is the only woman in the world who appeared on the cover of both &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Juggs&quot; magazine. Ashe&#x27;s business grew, allowing her to hire staff and models. By 2003, she had 50 full-time employees, a studio in Los Angeles (), and an archive containing hundreds of thousands of photos and thousands of hours of video. That year, &quot;Arena&quot; magazine ranked her fourth among the &quot;50 Most Powerful People in Porn&quot; list. Ashe was making a million dollars a year.

Danni&#x27;s Hard Drive was sold in 2004 to John Morisano. In 2006, Penthouse Media Group Inc. bought Danni.com and Video Bliss Inc. (owners of the website) for $3million.

==Recognition==
In 1998 in an E! channel special titled &quot;Women of the Net&quot; it was said, &quot;You may not know who Danni Ashe is, but when the History of the Internet is written she&#x27;ll have a chapter all to herself...a true Internet innovator.&quot; Other women profiled in the documentary are Halle Berry, Sandra Bullock, Asia Carrera, Ellen DeGeneres, Gloria Estefan, Cindy Margolis, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Markie Post.

Ashe&#x27;s website and exploits as an internet entrepreneur and a female executive were the subject of a 2000 book titled &quot;My Year in Smut: The Internet Escapades Inside Danni&#x27;s Hard Drive&quot; by Taylor Marsh.

In August 2000, Ashe earned the status of &quot;the most downloaded woman on the Internet&quot; by the Guinness Book of World Records overtaking Cindy Margolis who had been given the title the previous year. Later that year the status was further supported with her image being downloaded for the billionth time on her website Danni.com.

==Appearances==
Ashe has appeared on several television shows and series as herself as well as a variety of minor roles in movies. The list of shows and series includes E!&#x27;s &quot;Wild On!&quot;, &quot;Talk Soup&quot;, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, &quot;The Man Show&quot;, and &quot;Frontline&quot; on PBS. Ashe&#x27;s movie credits include &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe This Is Happening to Me!&quot;, &quot;Bondage on Stage&quot;, and &quot;Superheroine Double Feature&quot;.

In 1998, Ashe was featured and interviewed on an episode of &quot;The Internet Cafe&quot;.

In her February 2002 appearance on &quot;Frontline&quot;, Ashe was the subject of a May 2001 interview about the adult industry and her website. In the interview synopsis, Ashe is described as the &quot;founder and CEO of Danni&#x27;s Hard Drive, regarded as one of the most popular porn sites on the Internet...&quot; even though &quot;her site offers only softcore pornography and does not feature any female-male sex.&quot; In the interview, Ashe discusses her audience, what she offers them, and how she is planning for growth in her business.

In 2004, Ashe was featured as herself on the HBO documentary series &quot;Pornucopia: Going Down in the Valley&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Women on Top&quot; about the most powerful women in the industry.

==Industry advocacy==
In March 2000, Ashe testified as a panel member for the COPA Commission regarding &quot;Marketing Adult Materials Online&quot;. Ashe&#x27;s panel members included: Andrew Edmond, CEO, Flying Crocodile Inc.; Dr. Victor Cline, University of Utah; Detective LeeAnn Shirey, Seattle Police Department; FBI Supervisory Special Agent Randy Aden; FBI Special Agent Bruce Applin; and Detective Daryk Rowland, Huntington Beach, California Police Department.

==Defamation lawsuit==
In September 2013, Ashe filed suit against the newspaper and media outlet &quot;Daily Mail Online&quot; for an August 22, 2013 article posted under the headline &quot;Porn Industry shuts down with immediate effect after &#x27;female performer&#x27; tests positive for HIV&quot; that was accompanied by an image of Ashe. In her filing, she claimed that the Daily Mail never sought permission to use her image and did not include a disclaimer or otherwise make clear that she was not the HIV-positive performer in question.

Citing millions of views and worldwide syndication of the article, Ashe was seeking US$3 million in damages. The Mail&#x27;s London-based publisher Associated Newspapers, its parent A&amp;N International Media, and its subsidiary DMGT were named as defendants. The online image was later removed and replaced with a blurry image of a different model, according to the 14-page lawsuit, but a requested retraction has not been published.

In July 2016, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (Los Angeles) ruled the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; had a case to answer to. In January 2017, it was reported the parties had settled out of court.

<doc id="345106" wikidata="Q164883" url="?curid=345106" title="Initial D">
<text>is a Japanese street racing manga series written and illustrated by Shuichi Shigeno. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Young Magazine&quot; from 1995 to 2013, with the chapters collected into 48 volumes. The story focuses on the world of illegal Japanese street racing, where all the action is concentrated in the mountain passes and rarely in cities or urban areas, and with the drifting racing style emphasized in particular. Professional race car driver and pioneer of drifting Keiichi Tsuchiya helped with editorial supervision. The story is centered on the prefecture of Gunma, more specifically on several mountains in the Kantō region and in their surrounding cities and towns. Although some of the names of the locations the characters race in have been fictionalized, all of the locations in the series are based on actual locations in Japan.

&quot;Initial D&quot; has been adapted into several anime television and original video animations series by OB Studio Comet, Studio Gallop, Pastel, A.C.G.T and SynergySP. A live action film by Avex and Media Asia was released in 2005. Both the manga and anime series were initially licensed for English-language distribution in North America by Tokyopop (2002–2009). However, the anime license has since been picked up by Funimation (now Crunchyroll), while the manga was relicensed by Kodansha USA in 2019.

By April 2021, &quot;Initial D&quot; had over 55 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history.

==Plot==


Takumi Fujiwara is a student working as a gas station attendant with his best friend Itsuki. Itsuki is enthusiastically interested in being a street racer. The team he feels closest to and hopes to join is the Akina Speed Stars, whose team leader Koichiro Iketani is also working at the same pump station. Unbeknownst to his colleagues, Takumi helps out his father Bunta as a delivery driver for his father&#x27;s tofu store, passively building skill behind the wheel of the family car, an aging Toyota Sprinter Trueno (AE86).

Shortly after the story begins, the Red Suns, a highly experienced racing team from Mount Akagi led by Ryosuke Takahashi, challenge the local Speed Stars team to a set of races on Mount Akina. Dispirited after watching the Red Suns&#x27; superior performance during a practice run, the Speed Stars expect to lose. Later that night, the Red Suns&#x27; #2 driver, Keisuke Takahashi, heading home after the last practice run, is defeated soundly by a mysterious Sprinter Trueno, despite driving a much more powerful Mazda RX-7 (FD3S). An investigation into the identity of the driver leads to Bunta Fujiwara, Takumi&#x27;s father. While trying to do his best for the team on Mount Akina, Iketani suffers a crash and is unable to take part in the race. Iketani begs Bunta to help the Speed Stars defeat the Red Suns, who refuses, but later recruits Takumi for the race. Takumi easily defeats Keisuke by utilizing a dangerous &quot;gutter run&quot; technique (putting both the left/right tires into the gutters to prevent centrifugal force from pushing the car outward) on the mountain road&#x27;s hairpin corners.

The Red Suns&#x27; embarrassing defeat sets up the plot for the rest of the series: drivers from neighboring prefectures come to challenge Takumi and the &quot;Legendary Eight-Six of Akina&quot; and thus prove themselves as racers. Meanwhile, Takumi becomes more passionate about racing with every opponent he faces. However, soon Takumi faces a threat in the form of Emperors, a team that uses Mitsubishi Lancer Evolutions. Takumi&#x27;s old AE86 is no match and he loses to the team&#x27;s leader, Sudo Kyoichi (Evo III), blowing his engine. The Akagi RedSuns come to the rescue and defeat both Seiji and Kyoichi, thus securing the pride of Gunma&#x27;s racers. Meanwhile, Bunta replaces the AE86&#x27;s blown engine with a new one. Wataru Akiyama and Koichiro Iketani help Takumi to figure out why he is unable to control his car. Takumi soon faces graduation, but continues racing, even facing off and defeating Wataru Akiyama, whose car is the other version of the AE86, the &#x27;Levin&#x27;. He eventually defeats Kyoichi in a rematch at his home course, the Nikko Irohazaka. He also defeats the son of Bunta&#x27;s old rival, who drives a Toyota MR2 (SW20). At one point, Takumi&#x27;s girlfriend Natsuki is kidnapped, only for Takumi to come to the rescue in Lake Akina during winter time. They eventually break up, but promise to meet again soon.

Eventually, Takumi becomes bored with racing and winning solely on Mt. Akina. He joins an expedition racing team, Project D, formed by Ryosuke and Keisuke Takahashi, and challenges more difficult opponents on their home courses in the pursuit of his dream to be &quot;the fastest driver out there&quot;. At one point, impostors in the form of Takumi and Keisuke try to defame Project D, Wataru comes to help and they dispatch the impostors, revealing them in front of the public. Also, while making tofu deliveries, Takumi is defeated by a mysterious Subaru Impreza WRX STI, but after finding out the driver is his father, he must learn the characteristics of 4WD in order to better himself. Project D races against teams like Team Seven Star Leaf, students and a graduated pro racer from Todo Racing School, Northern Saitama Alliance, a second Lancer Evolution team at Tsuchisaka who resort to cheating to win, Team Purple Shadow, Team 246, the Kanagawa Racing Alliance, Team Spiral, and Team Sidewinder. During this, Takumi falls in love with another girl named Mika Uehara, and Ryosuke deals with an old rival that he previously had a falling out with the latter&#x27;s girlfriend who eventually committed suicide. The expedition of Project D ends spectacularly with a race between Takumi Fujiwara and Shinji Inui of Team Sidewinder, two evenly matched drivers, where Takumi blows his engine again, but steps on the clutch and wins the race by rolling backwards over the finish line. He then decides to put his AE86 on a complete rest from operating for the best (but in the anime he decommissioned the AE86 from racing but decides to keep it and slowly repair it with his own money). Ryosuke disbands Project D and later reveals the meaning of the Initial &quot;D&quot; and starts training other potential drivers under him to pursue his dream. Keisuke becomes a professional race car driver whereas Takumi continues delivering tofu in his father&#x27;s Subaru Impreza.

In the years that followed, Takumi would then pursue a career in rally racing and becomes a world champion legendary rally race car driver; this would lead to the events of &quot;MF Ghost&quot;, another manga by Shuichi Shigeno.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Shuichi Shigeno, &quot;Initial D&quot; was serialized for eighteen years by Kodansha in the manga magazine &quot;Weekly Young Magazine&quot;, starting on the July 17, 1995 issue, and concluded on July 29, 2013. Kodansha collected its 719 individual chapters in forty-eight volumes, released from November 6, 1995, to November 6, 2013.

In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Tokyopop (along with the anime series) in 2001. The company changed the names of the characters in the anime edition, and subsequently changed them in the manga to match. These name changes matched the name changes that Sega implemented into the Western releases of the &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage&quot; video games. Tokyopop also censored the brief scenes of nudity from the original manga. In addition, &quot;street slang&quot; was interlaced in translations. The company released thirty-three volumes from May 21, 2002, to January 13, 2009, before they announced in August 2009 that their manga licensing contracts with Kodansha had expired. In April 2019, ComiXology and Kodansha USA announced that they had released volumes 1 to 38 digitally, while volumes 39 to 48 were released in July of the same year. In August 2023, Kodansha USA announced that they would be re-releasing the manga in an omnibus format with new translation and lettering beginning in 2024. The first volume was released on March 19, 2024; it has three cover variants: a new cover made by Kodansha USA, a Crunchyroll and direct market exclusive variant, and a Kinokuniya variant. As of December 3, 2024, four volumes have been released.

===Anime===
Avex has released the anime in several parts called Stages. A recurrent feature of the anime is its extensive usage of Eurobeat as background music in race scenes, especially by Italian singers.

* &quot;Initial D Second Stage&quot;: 13 episodes (1999)

** A recap of the movie trilogy with additional scenes of the characters test driving their cars.

In 1998, &quot;Initial D&quot; was adapted into an animated television series produced by OB Planning and Prime Direction. The first episode premièred on Fuji TV on April 8, 1998. The initial series ran for 26 weekly episodes with the finale airing on December 5, 1998.

The second series, named &quot;Second Stage&quot;, aired from October 14, 1999, to January 20, 2000, with a one-week break over the New Year period. This was followed by animated feature film in 2001 and an OVA documenting all battles from the previous three stages, with the battles from &quot;First Stage&quot; being re-animated.

&quot;Initial D &quot;Third Stage&quot; &quot; was a feature film covering the story arcs between the second and fourth stage, released in Japan on January 13, 2001.

In 2004, &quot;Initial D Fourth Stage&quot; aired on SkyPerfecTV&#x27;s pay-per-view service, airing two episodes back-to-back every two months. 24 episodes were made until the final episodes were aired in February 2006.

Following &quot;Second Stage&quot; in 2000, &quot;Initial D Extra Stage&quot; was aired as a spinoff to the original series. This story focused on the all-female Impact Blue team of Usui Pass and their point of view of the recent events of &quot;Second Stage&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Third Stage&quot; movie. This was followed by &quot;Extra Stage 2&quot; in 2008, which look at the relationship between Impact Blue&#x27;s Mako Sato and Iketani of the SpeedStars (following on from the original side-story in the manga).

Eight years after the release of &quot;Fourth Stage&quot; in 2004, Animax aired &quot;Initial D Fifth Stage&quot;. Animax has aired the series on a pay-per-view basis on SKY PerfecTV!&#x27;s Perfect Choice Premier 1 channel. The first two episodes aired on November 9, 2012. The rest of the episodes were broadcast two per month till May 10, 2013.

In 2014, &quot;Initial D Final Stage&quot; became the latest installment in the anime series. Animax has aired its first two episodes on a pay-per-view basis on its own brand new ANIMAX PLUS channel, on May 16, 2014, on its new subscription VOD (Video On Demand) service, which allows subscribers to watch all the latest anime series. &quot;Initial D Final Stage&quot; starts right after where &quot;Fifth Stage&quot; left off. It consists of four episodes. The final two episodes were broadcast on June 22, 2014.

Since the anime&#x27;s original run, Japanese musical group m.o.v.e has performed all of the opening and some ending themes of the series. This followed on from the success of one of their first hits, &quot;Around the World&quot;, which was used as the first opening of &quot;First Stage&quot;. Their latest single to be used in the series is called &quot;Outsoar The Rainbow&quot; and it is used as &quot;Final Stage&quot;&#x27;s opening. They had another recent unreleased song, &quot;Days&quot;. It was played in the finale of &quot;Final Stage&quot;.

Like in the manga, Tokyopop changed elements of the anime to suit Western audiences. As well as changing the names and using western slang, the company also changed the anime&#x27;s music from the series&#x27; staple eurobeat tracks to originally developed tracks of rap and hip-hop via Stu Levy (DJ Milky), the Tokyopop CEO and an in-house musician.

In 2006, Funimation announced that it would be distributing the DVDs of the anime (since Tokyopop&#x27;s original distributor went bankrupt). This new distribution was marked by slightly revised packaging and two box sets corresponding to the licensed seasons Tokyopop had dubbed, although the DVDs themselves were exactly the same as the original Tokyopop release.

Tokyopop had completed an English subtitled version of &quot;Third Stage&quot;, and screened it at the Big Apple Anime Fest on August 29, 2003. This version of &quot;Third Stage&quot; reportedly retained the original Japanese soundtrack, in contrast to their treatment of the rest of the anime series. This version of the film was never released on DVD, although Tokyopop mentioned its plan to release it in 2006.

At the New York Anime Festival 2009, Funimation announced that it would be re-releasing and re-dubbing &quot;Initial D: First Stage&quot;, Second Stage, Extra Stage, &quot;Third Stage&quot;, and Fourth Stage. Their release included a brand new English dub and retained the original music from the Japanese in an uncut format. Funimation released the series out of order, with the Third and Fourth Stages releasing before the First and Second Stages. The first &quot;Extra Stage&quot; was included in the &quot;Second Stage&quot; box set.

===Animated feature film series===
In July 2013, it was announced that another feature film, titled &quot;New Initial D the Movie&quot;, and a last anime series, &quot;Initial D Final Stage&quot;, would be produced. The movie is a retelling of the early Stages with a wholly new voice cast and is split into three parts, with the first part released on August 23, 2014, titled &quot;Legend 1: Awakening&quot;, the second part was released May 23, 2015, titled &quot;Legend 2: Racer&quot;, the third part released on February 6, 2016, titled &quot;Legend 3: Dream&quot;.

===Live-action film===


A live-action film based on &quot;Initial D&quot; was released on June 23, 2005, in Asia. The film was jointly produced by Japan&#x27;s Avex Inc. and Hong Kong&#x27;s Media Asia Group. It was directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak, whose credits include the 2002 Hong Kong blockbuster &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;. The adaptation featured Taiwanese singer Jay Chou as Takumi Fujiwara and Hong Kong stars Edison Chen as Ryosuke Takahashi and Shawn Yue as Takeshi Nakazato. Despite many changes to the original plot, the film was met with generally positive reviews and was nominated for multiple awards, including Best Picture, at the Hong Kong Film Awards and Golden Horse Awards, winning many of them.

In October 2023, actor Sung Kang stated that he is working on developing another live-action film and is &quot;trying&quot; to direct it.

==Reception==
By July 2013, collected volumes of the &quot;Initial D&quot; manga series had sold 48million copies. By April 2021, &quot;Initial D&quot; had over 55 million copies in circulation.

&quot;Initial D&quot; received praise. The Anime Review rated it A−, with the reviewer calling it &quot;simply the best show I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.&quot; Bamboo Dong of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; rated it B−, stating it &quot;is the first time in a long while since I&#x27;ve been so fired up about a series, so I recommend to everyone to at least check this out.&quot; Some fans of &quot;Initial D&quot; reacted negatively to the Tokyopop&#x27;s extensive editing and changes made in the English-language version of the manga. Similar reactions were made towards their English dub&#x27;s script and voice acting, and the removal of the original music from the anime series. Tokyopop said that it was trying to Americanize the series so it could be aired on television, while at the same time keeping the Japanese spirit of the series.

Reviews of the Funimation re-release of the anime note a marked improvement from the Tokyopop iteration, with most complaints leveled against the lack of anamorphic widescreen on the DVDs. &quot;Initial D&quot; has drawn comparisons to the later &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; film franchise (debuted 2001), particularly &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; (2006), for which &quot;Initial D&quot;″s consultant, Keiichi Tsuchiya, served as a stunt coordinator and also made a cameo appearance in the film as a fisherman.

<text>The Ishikawajima Tsu-11 was a motorjet produced in small numbers in Japan in the closing stages of World War II. It was principally designed to propel the Japanese Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka flying bomb, a kamikaze weapon.

==Design and development==

The Tsu-11 used a four-cylinder inverted inline Hitachi Hatsukaze &quot;Toku&quot; Model 13 piston engine — a license-built version of the German Hirth HM 504 inverted, inline-four cylinder air-cooled engine, with the &quot;model 13&quot; version indicating its adaptation to drive a single-stage compressor. A fuel injection system was fitted behind the compressor. In operation, fuel would be mixed with the compressed air and the resulting mixture ignited, creating thrust.

The engine was designed to overcome the major shortcoming of the Ohka Type 11 weapons, that of limited range. The Type 11 was powered by solid-fuel rocket motors, which provided tremendous acceleration, but had a very short burn time. The upshot of this was that the Ohka&#x27;s carrier aircraft would have to fly very close to the target, making it vulnerable to interception. In practice, most Ohka-carrying bombers were shot down before they ever had the opportunity to launch their weapons. It was reasoned that a jet engine would provide high speed as well as enough range to keep the carrier plane safe long enough to release the Ohka and leave the area.

The engine was first tested hung underneath a Yokosuka P1Y bomber sometime in 1944 and was deemed successful enough to order into production. The Ohka was adapted to accommodate the engine in a lengthened fuselage with jet intakes added at the sides. This configuration was designated Ohka Type 22. The Tsu-11 was also selected to power the Yokosuka MXY9 &quot;Shuka&quot; (&quot;Autumn Fire&quot;) - a trainer intended to prepare pilots for the Mitsubishi J8M rocket-powered interceptor. Neither of these aircraft entered service, however, as their development took place too late in the war.

A single example of a Tsu-11 engine exists, preserved at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. In 1997 it was installed in the museum&#x27;s Ohka 22 during its restoration. Engineering analysis of the engine during the restoration process suggested that the fuel injection and combustion probably contributed little to the power of the engine, with most of the thrust actually being produced by the compressor.

<doc id="345112" wikidata="Q102967" url="?curid=345112" title="Flag of Ivory Coast">
<text>The national flag of Ivory Coast () is a tricolour flag consisting of equal bands of orange, white, and green. The proportions of the flag are 2:3. It is the national emblem of the Republic of Ivory Coast as affirmed in Article 29 of the Constitution in 1960.

==Design and symbolism==
In 1959, when the Ivorian Legislative Assembly adopted the flag, Minister of State stated:
When presenting the colors of the flag to the 1960 constitutional assembly, commissioner Mamadou Coulibaly said:
 wrote in 1964, &quot;The flag unites the colors of the three great landscapes of the Ivory Coast: green forest, white lagoon and orange savanna.&quot;

===Adoption===
The 1958 referendum replaced the French Fourth Republic with the Fifth Republic and at the same time replaced the French Union with the French Community, under which most colonies became &quot;autonomous states&quot;, including Ivory Coast on 4 December 1958. The new status allowed the adoption of a distinctive flag for the first time, in place of the French flag. The French commissioner suggested a red-white-and-blue flag with stars, but Ivorians wanted a greater departure from the flag of the former colonial power. The orange-white-and-green flag was adopted by law number 59-240, passed by the Ivorian Legislative Assembly on 3 December 1959, just before the first anniversary of the country&#x27;s autonomy.

Head of government Félix Houphouët-Boigny declared full independence from France on 7 August 1960, and the Legislative Assembly sat as a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution. Augustin Loubao proposed changing the orange stripe to red, to symbolize a willingness to shed blood to defend the new republic. Other legislators expressed strong opposition to any change, and the existing flag was retained in Article 1 of the constitution adopted on 3 December 1960. It was retained as Article 29 of the 2000 constitution and Article 48 of the 2016 constitution.

===Colors===
The three bands of the Ivorian tricolor must have the same width, and the mast is always placed on the orange band side. Although all laws define the colors of the flag, they do not specify the shade, so the bright orange and green colors can be replaced with slightly darker tones depending on the location and circumstances. The L&quot;&#x27;Album des pavillons nationaux et des marques distinctives (The Album of National Pavilions and Distinguishing Trademarks)&quot;, the 2000 edition of the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Navy, indicates that the official colors of the Ivorian flag are orange 151 C and green 347 C. CMYK values for the flag are based on Ivorian government usage. These are a little darker than the Pantone colors which are used by the similar flag of Ireland.

==Similar flags==

The Irish flag has a similar colour layout to the Ivorian one, but with the green on the hoist side and wider proportions (1:2 rather than 2:3). When Murielle Ahouré celebrated winning the 2018 world indoor 60-meter dash, for lack of an Ivorian flag to wave, she borrowed an Irish flag from a spectator and reversed it. Due to this similarity, in Northern Ireland, Ulster loyalists have sometimes desecrated the Ivorian flag, mistaking it for the Irish one. In some cases, Ivorian flags displayed in Northern Ireland have signs explicitly labelling them as such nearby to avoid having them desecrated by Ulster loyalists mistaking them for Irish ones.

The flag of Niger, also adopted in 1959 when Niger and Ivory Coast were both members of the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente, is a horizontal tricolor of orange, white and green; as with the Ivorian flag, the orange and green are sometimes said to represent the arid north and the more fertile south respectively.

He also holds the distinction of directing the first ever OVA, &quot;Dallos&quot; (1983). As a writer, Oshii has worked as a screenwriter, and occasionally as a manga writer and novelist. His most notable works as a writer include the manga &quot;Kerberos Panzer Cop&quot; (1988–2000) and its feature film adaptation &quot;Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade&quot; (1999).

For his work, Oshii has received and been nominated for numerous awards, including the Palme d&#x27;Or and Leone d&#x27;Oro (Golden Lion). He has also attracted praise from many directors, including James Cameron, Steven Spielberg and The Wachowskis, especially for his work on &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career (1977–1982)===
Oshii has said he had an interest in Christianity and the Bible from an early age. In an interview with &quot;Animerica&quot; magazine in 1996 that &quot;I really liked the Bible when I was a little boy. And when I was a student, at one point I was planning to enter a seminary, but I didn&#x27;t. Even now, though, I read the Bible sometimes.&quot; 

As a student, Mamoru Oshii was fascinated by the film &quot;La Jetée&quot; by Chris Marker. He also repeatedly watched European cinema, such as films by Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni and Jean-Pierre Melville. These filmmakers, together with Jean-Luc Godard, Andrei Tarkovsky and Jerzy Kawalerowicz, would later serve as influences for Oshii&#x27;s own cinematic career. He was also influenced by his father, who was a cinephile.

In 1976, he graduated from Tokyo Gakugei University. The following year, he entered Tatsunoko Productions and worked on his first anime as a storyboard artist on &quot;Ippatsu Kanta-kun&quot;. During this period at Tatsunoko, Oshii worked on many anime as a storyboard artist, most of which were part of the &quot;Time Bokan&quot; television series. In 1980, he moved to Studio Pierrot under the supervision of his mentor, Hisayuki Toriumi.

===Success with &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; (1981–1984)===
Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s work as director and storyboard artist of the animated &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; TV series brought him into the spotlight. Following its success, he directed two &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; films: &quot;Urusei Yatsura: Only You&quot; (1983) and &quot;Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer&quot; (1984). The first film, though an original story, continued much in the spirit of the series. &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; was also written by Oshii with no consultation from Takahashi and was a significant departure and an early example of his now contemporary style. &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; is also notable for experimenting with concepts such as a time loop, where a high-school class relives the same day over and over again, as well as dreams and reality manipulation.

===&quot;Dallos&quot;, &quot;Lupin&quot;, &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; and &quot;Anchor&quot; (1983–1985)===
In the midst of his work with Studio Pierrot, Oshii took on independent work and directed the first OVA, &quot;Dallos&quot;, in 1983. In 1984, Oshii left Studio Pierrot. 
Around this time, Oshii was hired to direct a movie for Lupin the Third for summer 1985, for which he started writing a column in Animage magazine in December 1984. However, his proposal for it was very eccentric, with the producers from Yomiuri TV and Toho opposed his vision of the film, saying that it &quot;made no sense&quot;. The film had been widely advertised with Oshii&#x27;s name attached to it, and with the project based around him, they could not make the film without his proposal getting approved, and it was cancelled. He would later go on to reuse themes and concepts he had come up with for the movie in later works such as Angel&#x27;s Egg, Ghost in the Shell, and multiple Patlabor movies.

Oshii said that creating &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; allowed him to &quot;finally get over Lupin&quot; but continued to use elements from it in future films such as 009 RE:CYBORG, which was directed by Kenji Kamiyama, a student of Oshii, that Oshii was originally supposed to direct and had him participating in the scriptwriting for, which was also heavily influenced by the themes of Oshii&#x27;s Lupin, which reused some of its plot, and , which reused the ending he originally had in mind for Lupin. He originally wanted to use this ending for the first Patlabor movie but was stopped by Izubuchi and others. Oshii was eventually able to revisit Lupin in Lupin the 3rd Part 6 in which he wrote the script for two episodes of which the second, &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Bird&quot; reused some elements from the cancelled movie.

Moving to Studio Deen, Oshii wrote and directed &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; (1985), a surreal film rich with Biblical symbolism, featuring the character designs of Yoshitaka Amano. A producer of the film, Toshio Suzuki, later founded Studio Ghibli with Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. Following the release of the film, Miyazaki and Takahata began collaborating with Mamoru Oshii on his next film, &quot;Anchor&quot;. The film was canceled early in the initial planning stages when the trio had artistic disagreements. Despite their differences, Toshio Suzuki and Studio Ghibli would later help Oshii with his production of &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot; (2004). To this day, Oshii maintains skeptical, but respectful, views of each of Takahata and Miyazaki&#x27;s films. Though he has been critical of Miyazaki&#x27;s attitude towards his workers, he also claims that he would feel &quot;strangely empty&quot; and &quot;it would be boring&quot; if both Miyazaki and Takahata stopped making films.

===&quot;Patlabor&quot; and live-action (1987–1993)===
In the late 1980s, Oshii was solicited by his friend Kazunori Itō to join Headgear as a director. The group was composed of Kazunori Itō (screenwriter), Masami Yuki (manga artist), Yutaka Izubuchi (mechanical designer), Akemi Takada (character designer) and Mamoru Oshii (director). Together they were responsible for the &quot;Patlabor&quot; TV series, OVA, and films.

Between production of the Patlabor movies/series, Oshii delved into live-action for the first time, releasing his first non-animated film, &quot;The Red Spectacles&quot; (1987). This led to another live-action work titled &quot;Stray Dog: Kerberos Panzer Cops&quot; (1991); both films are part of Oshii&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Kerberos Saga&quot;. Following &quot;Stray Dog&quot; Oshii made yet another live-action film, &quot;Talking Head&quot; (1992).

In the early 1990s, Oshii was approached by Studio Ghibli to direct an animated film adaptation of Ken&#x27;ichi Sakemi&#x27;s novel &quot;Bokkō&quot;. Animator Katsuya Kondo even drew image boards, but the project was cancelled again due to a conflict between Oshii and Miyazaki.

===&quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; and international acclaim (1995–2008)===
In 1995, Mamoru Oshii released his landmark animated cyberpunk film, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, in Japan, the United States, and Europe. It hit the top of the US Billboard video charts in 1996, the first anime video ever to do so. Concerning a female cyborg desperate to find the meaning of her existence, the film was a critical success and is widely regarded to be a masterpiece and anime classic. Additionally, Oshii said that creating &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; allowed him to &quot;finally get over Lupin&quot; 

After a 5-year hiatus from directing to work on other projects, Oshii returned to live-action with the Japanese-Polish feature &quot;Avalon&quot; (2001), which was selected for an out of competition screening at the Cannes Film Festival. His next animated feature film was the long-awaited sequel to &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, titled &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot;. Four years in the making, the film focuses on Batou as he investigates a series of gruesome murders, while trying to reconcile with his deteriorating humanity. Though it received mixed reviews, &quot;Innocence&quot; was selected to compete at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival for the coveted Palme d&#x27;Or prize, making it the first (and thus far, only) anime to be so honored.

Oshii was approached to be one of the directors of &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, but he was unable to participate because of his work in &quot;Innocence&quot;. Following &quot;Innocence&quot;, Oshii also contemplated directing a segment for the anthology film &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot;, but ultimately declined the offer.

Meanwhile, in 2005, there were talks of a Kenta Fukasaku and Oshii collaboration. It was announced that Oshii would write the script for a film titled &quot;Elle is Burning&quot;, as well as provide CGI consultation, while Fukasaku would direct. Although Oshii completed the script, the film was ultimately shelved because, among other problems, the large budget it would require.
Oshii&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Sky Crawlers&quot; (2008), competed for the Golden Lion in the Venice Film Festival. Subsequent to &quot;The Sky Crawlers&quot;, Oshii wrote the screenplay to the Production I.G film &quot;Musashi: The Dream of the Last Samurai&quot;, which has been described as possibly the first ever anime documentary.

===Return to live-action and anime directing hiatus (2009–present)===
In 2009, he wrote and directed the live-action feature &quot;Assault Girls&quot; and served as creative director for the Production I.G-produced segment of the animated short film anthology &quot;Halo Legends&quot;. In 2010, Oshii announced his next film will be an adaptation of Mitsuteru Yokoyama&#x27;s Tetsujin-28 manga. The Tetsujin-28 project turned out to be a live action film called &#x27;28 1/2&#x27;.

In 2012, Oshii announced that he was working on a new live-action film. He will be writing and directing the military science-fiction thriller &quot;Garm Wars: The Last Druid&quot;. The film&#x27;s trailer was released in September 2014, and the premiere screening was held the following month at the 27th Tokyo International Film Festival.

He followed with the live-action film &quot;Tōkyō Mukokuseki Shōjo&quot;, a suspense thriller released in July 2015.

In March 2017, Toonami began airing &quot;Sand Whale and Me&quot;, a live-action micro-series directed by Oshii. In 2018, it was reported that an anime film adaptation of &quot;Chimera&quot; is under production, with Oshii serving as director.

In June 2019, Oshii announced &quot;Vladlove&quot;, a comedy series that he described as a &quot;girl-meets-girl story&quot; about a vampire. The project also departs from the Japanese anime world&#x27;s production committee system because Oshii is backed by a single investor, real estate company Ichigo Inc.

==Style==
Oshii has stated his approach to directing is in direct contrast to what he perceives to be the Hollywood formula, i.e. he regards the visuals as the most important aspect, followed by the story and the characters come last. He also notes that his main motivation in making films is to &quot;create worlds different from our own.&quot;

Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s films typically open with an action sequence. Thereafter, the film usually follows a much slower rhythm punctuated by several sequences of fast action. Oshii also frequently inserts a montage sequence in each of his movies, typically two-minutes long, muted of dialogue and set against the backdrop of Kenji Kawai&#x27;s music. Recurrent imagery include reflections/mirrors, flocks of birds, and basset hounds similar to his own. The basset hound was seen most prominently in &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot;, and was a major plot point in his live-action film &quot;Avalon&quot;.

Oshii is especially noted for how he significantly strays from the source material his films are based on, such as in his adaptations of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. In their original manga versions, these titles exhibited a mood that was more along the lines of frantic slapstick comedy (&quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;) or convivial dramedy (&quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;). Oshii, in adapting the works created a slower and darker atmosphere especially noticeable in &quot;Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer&quot;. For the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; movie, Oshii elected to leave out the humor and character banter of Masamune Shirow&#x27;s original manga. This example can also be seen at &quot;Patlabor 2: The Movie&quot;, in which Oshii eschew the slice-of-life aspect of the original source&#x27;s in favor of a more political thriller focused story. 

&quot;Oshii&#x27;s work... steers clear of such stereotypes in both image and sexual orientation,&quot; wrote Andrez Bergen in an article on Oshii that appeared in Japan&#x27;s &quot;Daily Yomiuri&quot; newspaper in 2004. &quot;His movies are dark, thought-provoking, minimalist diatribes with an underlying complexity; at the same time he pushes the perimeters of technology when it comes to the medium itself. Character design plays equitable importance.&quot;

Oshii also wrote and directed several animated movies and live-action films based on his personal political views, influenced by the Anpo protests of the 1960s and 1970s in which he participated. The Anpo protests were protests during 1960s Japan against the US-Japan Security Treaty. The first film to touch on this political background was the live-action film &quot;The Red Spectacles&quot;. This film, set in the same world as the Oshii-scripted film &quot;Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade&quot; (1999), is about a former member of the special unit of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Force dealing with a fascist government.

Many of his works include references to Christianity and the Bible. 

==Influence==
The Wachowskis are known to have been impressed with &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; and went as far as to screen it to producer Joel Silver to show him what kind of film they wanted to make for &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Indeed, various scenes from &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; have been seemingly lifted and transposed in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; was also the chief inspiration for the video game &quot;Oni&quot;.

His 1984 anime film &quot;Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer&quot;, which experimented with concepts such as a time loop, dreams, and reality manipulation, has drawn comparisons to later films including &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (1993) and &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998), and is believed to have influenced these films.

Kenji Kamiyama, the director of the &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot; television series, considers Oshii his mentor, and states that he &quot;totally tried to copy&quot; Oshii&#x27;s style when creating the &quot;Stand Alone Complex&quot; series.

Many have also noted the similarities in the Helghast design from the &quot;Killzone&quot; series of video games to the Kerberos Panzer Protect Gear, first seen in the 1987 film &quot;The Red Spectacles&quot;. Asked of these observations, Guerrilla Games, video game developer for the Killzone series, did not address the similarities. The developers contend the Helghast design was inspired by the gas masks of World War I, though this does not account for the similarity in the glowing red/orange eyes between the two designs.

James Cameron is another filmmaker who has voiced his admiration for Oshii, stating at one point that &quot;Avalon&quot; was &quot;the most artistic, beautiful and stylish sci-fi film.&quot; He also praised &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, stating it was &quot;the first truly adult animation film to reach a level of literary and visual excellence.&quot;

== Personal life ==
As of 2009, Oshii lived in Atami, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan with his dog, a mutt named Daniel. When commenting on religion he said &quot;I&#x27;m not a Christian, but I&#x27;ve been reading the Bible since my student days&quot;.

==Collaboration==
Mamoru Oshii has worked extensively with Production I.G. Every animated film he has made since &quot;&quot; (1989) has been produced under the studio. He also worked closely with screenwriter Kazunori Itō; they made five films together, beginning with &quot;The Red Spectacles&quot; and ending with &quot;Avalon&quot;. His closest colleague, however, is music composer Kenji Kawai. Kawai has composed most of the music in Oshii&#x27;s work, including ten of his feature films. According to Oshii, &quot;Kenji Kawai&#x27;s music is responsible for 50 percent of [his] films&#x27; successes&quot; and he &quot;can&#x27;t do anything without [Kenji Kawai].&quot;

==&quot;Kerberos&quot; saga==
===1980s===
The &quot;Kerberos&quot; saga is Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s lifework, created in 1986. A military science fiction franchise and alternate history universe, it spans all media and has lasted for more than 20 years since his January 1987 radio drama &quot;While Waiting for the Red Spectacles&quot;. In 1987, Oshii released &quot;The Red Spectacles&quot;, his first live-action feature and the first &quot;Kerberos&quot; saga film. The manga adaptation, &quot;Kerberos Panzer Cop&quot;, written by Mamoru Oshii and illustrated by Kamui Fujiwara, was serialized in 1988 until 1990.

===1990s===
Acts 1~4 of&quot; Kerberos Panzer Cop&quot; was compiled in 1990 as a single volume. In 1991, the live-action film adaptation of the &quot;tankōbon&quot; was released as &quot;StrayDog Kerberos Panzer Cops&quot;. In 1999, the Oshii-scripted &quot;Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade&quot;, the anime feature film adaptation of the manga&#x27;s first volume, was directed by Oshii&#x27;s collaborator Hiroyuki Okiura, and was released in International Film Festivals starting in France.

===2000s===
In 2000, the second part of the manga (Acts 5~8) was serialized, then published and compiled as a second volume. After the manga&#x27;s completion and publishing as volumes 1 and 2, &quot;Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade&quot; was finally released in Japan during the same year. In 2003, &quot;Kerberos Panzer Cop&quot;&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Kerberos Saga Rainy Dogs&quot; was serialized, then compiled as a single volume in 2005. In 2006 &quot;Kerberos Panzer Jäger&quot; was broadcast in Japan as a 20-year celebration of the saga. The same year, Oshii revealed his plan to release an anime/3DCG adaptation film of the drama in 2009, the &quot;Kerberos Panzer Blitzkrieg project&quot;. In late 2006, Oshii launched a &quot;Kerberos&quot; saga crossover manga series titled &quot;Kerberos &amp; Tachiguishi&quot;.

==Other work==
In addition to his directing work, Oshii is a prolific screenwriter and author of manga and novels. As well as writing the &quot;Kerberos&quot; series of manga, Oshii wrote the script for the manga &quot;Seraphim 266,613,336 Wings&quot; originally illustrated by Satoshi Kon. Their collaboration was difficult due to artistic differences over the development of the story and &quot;Seraphim&quot; was not completed. Part one was serialised in 16 instalments in the May 1994 through November 1995 issues of monthly &quot;Animage&quot;. 

Following Satoshi Kon&#x27;s death in 2010 it was partially reissued in a special memorial supplement of &quot;Monthly Comic Ryū&quot; and published in comic book form the same year. Oshii has since worked on a &quot;Seraphim&quot; &quot;Prologue&quot;, the &quot;Three Wise Men&#x27;s Worship Volume&quot;, with illustrations by Katsuya Terada, released by Tokuma Shoten as another &quot;Ryū&quot; supplement. Oshii also wrote the screenplay of &quot;Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade&quot; and is credited as a co-planner for &quot;&quot; (2000) and &quot;Blood+&quot;. Oshii also wrote the first tie-in novel for the film entitled &quot;Blood: The Last Vampire: Night of the Beasts&quot;. It was published originally in Japan in October 2000, and later received an English-translated North American release on 23 November 2005.

Oshii is also credited as providing &quot;story concept&quot; for &quot;Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG&quot;; he describes his role as supervision of the entire series and being responsible for writing the plot of each of the show&#x27;s episodes. In 2005 Oshii served as supervisor for the &quot;Mobile Police Patlabor Comes Back: MiniPato&quot; video game. In 2008, he again served as special consultant for the development of a video game, &quot;The Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces&quot;.

<text>Albert Bates Lord (15 September 1912 – 29 July 1991) was a professor of Slavic and comparative literature at Harvard University who carried on Milman Parry&#x27;s research on epic poetry after Parry&#x27;s death.

==Early life==
Lord was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He graduated from Boston Latin School in 1930 and attended Harvard College, where he received an A.B. in classics in 1934 and a Ph.D. in comparative literature in 1949.

==Career==
Lord became a professor of Slavic and comparative literature at Harvard in 1950. He was later promoted as a full professor there in Classics. He also founded Harvard&#x27;s Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology, and chaired the college&#x27;s Department of Folklore and Mythology until his retirement in 1983.

Lord authored the book &quot;The Singer of Tales&quot;, first published in 1960. It was reissued in a 40th anniversary edition, with an audio compact disc to aid in the understanding of the recorded renditions discussed in the text. His wife Mary Louise Lord completed and edited his manuscript of a posthumous sequel &quot;The Singer Resumes the Tale&quot; (published 1995) which further supports and extends Lord&#x27;s initial conclusions.

Lord demonstrated the ways in which various great ancient epics from Europe and Asia were heirs to a tradition not only of oral performance, but of oral &quot;composition&quot;. He argued strongly for a complete divide between the non-literate authors of the Homeric epics and the scribes who later wrote them down. Lord studied and made field recordings of South-Slavic heroic epics sung to the gusle, most notable of poets he worked with was Avdo Međedović. He studied not only Homeric epics, but also &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;, and others. Across these many story traditions he found strong commonalities concerning the oral composition of traditional storytelling.

==Personal life==
His wife, Mary Louise Lord née Carlson, taught classics at Connecticut College; they had two children. Lord died in July 1991 at Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<text>In the sport of cricket, a bail is one of the two smaller sticks placed on top of the three stumps to form a wicket. The bails are used to determine when the wicket is &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;put down&quot;, which in turn is one of the critical factors in determining whether a batsman is out bowled, stumped, run out or hit wicket. 

The wicket is considered to be broken if one or both of the bails fall from the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the ground, by:
*the ball, 
*the striking batsman&#x27;s bat, or any part of the striker&#x27;s body or clothing (even if it falls off), or
*a fielder with the hand or arm holding the ball.

This means, for example, that if the ball hits the wicket directly from the bowler&#x27;s delivery, the batsman is only out bowled if a bail falls off, so a ball can actually brush or rest against the stumps without the batsman being dismissed (as long as the bail remains in its groove).

If a bail falls off the stumps for any other reason while the ball is still in play, and a later incident such as a ran out attempt requires the wicket to be broken, then the other bail can be removed (if it has not yet fallen off), or a stump can be struck out of the cricket ground or pulled up, as described above.

Each bail is made of a single cylindrically shaped piece of wood which has two smaller cylinders of wood protruding from each end. The large central cylinder is called the &quot;barrel&quot; and the smaller protrusions are the &quot;spigots&quot;. The spigots are of unequal length: the longer rests alone on one stump, while the shorter rests on the middle stump together with the short spigot of the other bail.

Special heavy bails made of denser wood (usually lignum vitae) are sometimes used in windy conditions if the normal light bails are likely to be blown off the stumps. The umpires can decide to dispense with the bails completely (for example, where strong gusts of wind would remove even the heavy bails), in which case the umpires will adjudge whether or not the wicket is broken, however, Hawk-Eye graphics, part of the Decision Review System, still assumes the bails are on the stump.

==Quotation==

An excerpt from Law 8(3)(b) of the Laws of cricket:

:&quot;Each bail shall conform to the following specifications:&quot;
:*&quot;Overall length:- 4 5/16 in/10.95cm&quot;
:*&quot;Length of barrel:- 2 1/8 in/5.40cm&quot;
:*&quot;Longer spigot:- 1 3/8 in/3.49cm&quot;
:*&quot;Shorter spigot:- 13/16 in/2.06cm&quot;

<text>In phonetics, ejective consonants are usually voiceless consonants that are pronounced with a glottalic egressive airstream. In the phonology of a particular language, ejectives may contrast with aspirated, voiced and tenuis consonants. Some languages have glottalized sonorants with creaky voice that pattern with ejectives phonologically, and other languages have ejectives that pattern with implosives, which has led to phonologists positing a phonological class of glottalic consonants, which includes ejectives.

==Description==
In producing an ejective, the stylohyoid muscle and digastric muscle contract, causing the hyoid bone and the connected glottis to rise, and the forward articulation (at the velum in the case of ) is held, raising air pressure greatly in the mouth so when the oral articulators separate, there is a dramatic burst of air. The Adam&#x27;s apple may be seen moving when the sound is pronounced. In the languages in which they are more obvious, ejectives are often described as sounding like &quot;spat&quot; consonants, but ejectives are often quite weak. In some contexts and in some languages, they are easy to mistake for tenuis or even voiced stops. These weakly ejective articulations are sometimes called &quot;intermediates&quot; in older American linguistic literature and are notated with different phonetic symbols: = strongly ejective, = weakly ejective. Strong and weak ejectives have not been found to be contrastive in any natural language.

In strict, technical terms, ejectives are glottalic egressive consonants. The most common ejective is even if it is more difficult to produce than other ejectives like or because the auditory distinction between and is greater than with other ejectives and voiceless consonants of the same place of articulation. In proportion to the frequency of uvular consonants, is even more common, as would be expected from the very small oral cavity used to pronounce a voiceless uvular stop. , on the other hand, is quite rare. That is the opposite pattern to what is found in the implosive consonants, in which the bilabial is common and the velar is rare.

Ejective fricatives are rare for presumably the same reason: with the air escaping from the mouth while the pressure is being raised, like inflating a leaky bicycle tire, it is harder to distinguish the resulting sound as salient as a .

==Occurrence==
Ejectives occur in about 20% of the world&#x27;s languages. Ejectives that phonemically contrast with pulmonic consonants occur in about 15% of languages around the world. The occurrence of ejectives often correlates to languages in mountainous regions such as the Caucasus which forms an island of ejective languages. They are also found frequently in the East African Rift and the South African Plateau (see Geography of Africa). In the Americas, they are extremely common in the North American Cordillera. They also frequently occur throughout the Andes and Maya Mountains. Elsewhere, they are rare.

Language families that distinguish ejective consonants include:
* Afroasiatic languages, especially in the Cushitic and Omotic branches, and in some languages of the Semitic (Ethio-Semitic and Modern South Arabian) and Chadic branches (e.g. Hausa)
* All three families of the Caucasus: the Northwest Caucasian languages (Circassian, Abkhaz and Ubykh); the Northeast Caucasian languages such as Chechen and Avar; and the Kartvelian languages such as Georgian
* the Athabaskan, Siouan and Salishan families of North America along with the many diverse families of the Pacific Northwest from central California to British Columbia
*Mayan family, as well as neighboring Lencan languages and Xincan languages
*Aymaran family
* the southern varieties of Quechua (Qusqu-Qullaw)
* Puelche and Tehuelche of the Chonan languages
*Alacalufan family
* Gumuz, Meʼen, Tʼwampa and possibly other Nilo-Saharan languages
* Sandawe, Hadza, and the Khoisan families of southern Africa
* Itelmen of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages
* Yapese and Waima&#x27;a of the Austronesian family
* Kunigami and several Northern Ryukyuan and Yaeyama varieties of the Japonic-Ryukyuan family
According to the glottalic theory, the Proto-Indo-European language had a series of ejectives (or, in some versions, implosives), but no extant Indo-European language has retained them. Ejectives are found today in Ossetian and some Armenian dialects only because of influence of the nearby Northeast Caucasian and/or Kartvelian language families.

It had once been predicted that ejectives and implosives would not be found in the same language but both have been found phonemically at several points of articulation in Nilo-Saharan languages (Gumuz, Me&#x27;en, and T&#x27;wampa), Mayan language (Yucatec), Salishan (Lushootseed), and the Oto-Manguean Mazahua. Nguni languages, such as Zulu have an implosive &quot;b&quot; alongside a series of allophonically ejective stops. Dahalo of Kenya, has ejectives, implosives, and click consonants.

Non-contrastively, ejectives are found in many varieties of British English, usually replacing word-final fortis plosives in utterance-final or emphatic contexts.

==Types==
Almost all ejective consonants in the world&#x27;s languages are stops or affricates, and all ejective consonants are obstruents. is the most common ejective, and is common among languages with uvulars, less so, and is uncommon. Among affricates, are all quite common, and and are not unusual ( is particularly common among the Khoisan languages, where it is the ejective equivalent of ).

A few languages have ejective fricatives. In some dialects of Hausa, the standard affricate is a fricative ; Ubykh (Northwest Caucasian, now extinct) had an ejective lateral fricative ; and the related Kabardian also has ejective labiodental and alveolopalatal fricatives, . Tlingit is an extreme case, with ejective alveolar, lateral, velar, and uvular fricatives, ; it may be the only language with the last type. Upper Necaxa Totonac is unusual and perhaps unique in that it has ejective fricatives (alveolar, lateral, and postalveolar ) but lacks any ejective stop or affricate (Beck 2006). Other languages with ejective fricatives are Yuchi, which some sources analyze as having (but not the analysis of the Wikipedia article), Keres dialects, with , and Lakota, with . Amharic is interpreted by many as having an ejective fricative , at least historically, but it has been also analyzed as now being a sociolinguistic variant (Takkele Taddese 1992).

An ejective retroflex stop is rare. It has been reported from Yawelmani and other Yokuts languages, Tolowa, and Gwich&#x27;in.

Because the complete closing of the glottis required to form an ejective makes voicing impossible, the allophonic voicing of ejective phonemes causes them to lose their glottalization; this occurs in Blin (modal voice) and Kabardian (creaky voice). A similar historical sound change also occurred in Veinakh and Lezgic in the Caucasus, and it has been postulated by the glottalic theory for Indo-European. Some Khoisan languages have voiced ejective stops and voiced ejective clicks; however, they actually contain mixed voicing, and the ejective release is voiceless.

s aren&#x27;t attested in any language, even allophonically. An ejective would necessarily be voiceless, but the vibration of the trill, combined with a lack of the intense voiceless airflow of , gives an impression like that of voicing. Similarly, ejective nasals such as (also necessarily voiceless) are possible. (An apostrophe is commonly seen with &quot;r&quot;, &quot;l&quot; and nasals, but that is Americanist phonetic notation for a glottalized consonant and does not indicate an ejective.)

Other ejective sonorants are not known to occur. When sonorants are transcribed with an apostrophe in the literature as if they were ejective, they actually involve a different airstream mechanism: they are glottalized consonants and vowels whose glottalization partially or fully interrupts an otherwise normal voiced pulmonic airstream, somewhat like English &quot;uh-uh&quot; (either vocalic or nasal) pronounced as a single sound. Often the constriction of the larynx causes it to rise in the vocal tract, but this is individual variation and not the initiator of the airflow. Such sounds generally remain voiced.

Yeyi has a set of prenasalized ejectives like /ⁿtʼ, ᵑkʼ, ⁿtsʼ/.

==Orthography==
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, ejectives are indicated with a &quot;modifier letter apostrophe&quot; , as in this article. A reversed apostrophe is sometimes used to represent light aspiration, as in Armenian linguistics ; this usage is obsolete in the IPA. In other transcription traditions (such as many romanisations of Russian, where it is transliterating the soft sign), the apostrophe represents palatalization: = IPA . In some Americanist traditions, an apostrophe indicates weak ejection and an exclamation mark strong ejection: . In the IPA, the distinction might be written , but it seems that no language distinguishes degrees of ejection. Transcriptions of the Caucasian languages often utilize combining dots above or below a letter to indicate an ejective.

In alphabets using the Latin script, an IPA-like apostrophe for ejective consonants is common. However, there are other conventions. In Hausa, the hooked letter ƙ is used for . In Zulu and Xhosa, whose ejection is variable between speakers, plain consonant letters are used: &quot;p t k ts tsh kr&quot; for . In some conventions for Haida and Hadza, double letters are used: &quot;tt kk qq ttl tts&quot; for (Haida) and &quot;zz jj dl gg&quot; for (Hadza).

==The Mountain Hypothesis==
A pattern can be observed wherein ejectives correlate geographically with mountainous regions. argues that the geographic correlation between languages with ejectives and mountainous terrains is because of decreased air pressure making ejectives easier to produce, as well as the way ejectives help to reduce water vapor loss. The argument has been criticized as being based on a spurious correlation.

<text>Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. was a satellite radio (SDARS) and online radio service operating in North America, owned by Sirius XM Holdings.

Headquartered in New York City, with smaller studios in Los Angeles and Memphis, Sirius was officially launched on July 1, 2002. It now provides 69 streams (channels) of music and 65 streams of sports, news, and entertainment to its subscribers. A subset of Sirius music channels is included as part of the Dish Network satellite television service. Sirius channels are identified by Nielsen Audio with the label &quot;SR&quot; (e.g. &quot;SR120&quot;, &quot;SR9&quot;, &quot;SR17&quot;).

Its business model is to provide pay-for-service radio, analogous to the business model for premium cable television. Music channels are presented without advertising, while its talk channels, such as Howard Stern&#x27;s Howard 100 and Howard 101 and Jason Ellis&#x27; Faction Talk, carry commercials. Because all channels are free from FCC content regulation, songs are played unedited for language; talk programs may also feature explicit content if they wish. Subscriptions are prepaid and range in price from US$14.99 monthly (US$9.99 for each additional receiver) to US$699.99 for lifetime (of the receiver equipment). There is a US$15 activation fee for every radio activated. Sirius announced it had achieved its first positive cash flow quarter for the period ending December 2006.

Sirius launched its radio service in four states on February 14, 2002, expanding service to the rest of the contiguous U.S. by July of that year. On October 16, 2006, Sirius announced that it would be launching Sirius Internet Radio, with 78 of its 135 channels being available worldwide on the internet to any of its subscribers with a valid user name and password.

On July 29, 2008, Sirius formally completed its merger with former competitor XM Satellite Radio. The combined company began operating under the name Sirius XM Satellite Radio. On November 12, 2008, Sirius and XM began broadcasting with their new, combined channel lineups. On January 13, 2011, Sirius Satellite Radio was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.

==Early days of Sirius==
Sirius was founded by Martine Rothblatt, who served as the new company&#x27;s Chairman of the Board. Co-founder David Margolese served as Chief Executive Officer and Robert Briskman served as President and Chief Operating Officer. In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio, Inc. in Washington, D.C. The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which &quot;provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations.&quot; Rothblatt had previously helped create the PanAmSat international satellite television system, and helped launch and served as CEO of the Geostar satellite navigation system. In April 1992, she resigned as chairman and CEO of Sirius in order to start a medical research foundation, focused on finding a cure for her daughter&#x27;s illness. Former NASA engineer Robert Briskman, who designed the company&#x27;s satellite technology, was then appointed Chairman and CEO.

Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder David Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000. The company successfully bid $83.3 million to purchase their satellite radio license. In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and &quot;effectively created the industry,&quot; the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius&#x27;s example.

In November 1999, Marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company, this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology. It had secured installation deals with automakers including Chrysler, Ford and BMW. Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities, with the first receiver sold at Cowboy Maloney&#x27;s in Jackson, MS on February 14, 2002, expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002. In 2001 Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him &quot;for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry.&quot;

The first confirmed music transmission from satellite to radio receiver for Sirius was September 1, 2000, in NYC at the current HQ of SiriusXM. Ten employees were present during the first music transmission. One being Lawrence J. Simon, current VP Business and Ground Ops (Former B2B board member for NASCAR, Director of labs for Lockheed Martin and Grumman), Paul De Lia, current Senior Advisor for BCG (Former CTO for L3-Harris).

Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004. He remained chairman until July 2008. Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger in December 2012.

==Merger with XM Satellite Radio and company restructuring==
On February 19, 2007, Sirius announced a merger deal with competitor XM Satellite Radio. If the pending merger received government approval, which was required because of antitrust considerations, it would combine the two services into a single satellite radio network in the United States and would be named Sirius/XM Radio.

On March 24, 2008, the U.S. Department of Justice approved the merger of Sirius and XM. Approval from the FCC cleared on July 25, 2008. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.

===Channels===
*&quot;List of Sirius XM Radio channels&quot;
According to a Spring 2007 Arbitron report, the five channels most listened to on Sirius based on their average quarterly hour (AQH) share were Howard 100, Howard 101, The Highway (56), Sirius Hits 1, and Octane (37).

===Howard Stern===
On October 6, 2004, Sirius announced that it had signed a five-year, US$100 million per year agreement with Howard Stern to move his radio show, The Howard Stern Show, to Sirius starting on January 9, 2006. Stern said his move was forced by the stringent regulations of the FCC whose enforcement was intensified following the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. In the wake of the announcement of his pending departure, Stern complained that Infinity Broadcasting was making his departure more acrimonious than was necessary. The deal, which gave Sirius exclusive rights to Stern&#x27;s radio show, also gave Stern the right to build three full-time programming channels. His audience had grown almost tenfold by the end of his second year on Sirius, from fewer than 700,000 subscribers to 6 million (see graph on the right). Stern now has two channels operating on Sirius, but still retains the right to a third.

===Programming content===
Sirius/XM&#x27;s channels carried an array of programming that covered Music, News/Talk, Sports, and Entertainment. Sirius had deals with entertainers and personalities for broadcast streams. Besides Stern, Sirius had deals with Martha Stewart, E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt, Jimmy Buffett, and Eminem to executive-produce streams or channels on Sirius. Van Zandt created two stations for Sirius: the &quot;Underground Garage&quot;, dedicated to garage rock, and &quot;Outlaw Country&quot; with its focus on alternative country music.

The majority of the company&#x27;s programming was self-produced exclusively for Sirius. However, there were some shows—especially in the Talk genre—that were originally created for terrestrial radio, but then aired on conventional radio and on Sirius/XM simultaneously; one example was the &quot;Eternal Word Television Network&quot;.

Among the hosts with Sirius/XM shows were:

* Sports figures such as Lance Armstrong, NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton, sports show host Scott Ferrall, fantasy football experts John Hansen and Adam Caplan from FantasyGuru.com, skateboarder Tony Hawk, skateboarder/MTV personality Bam Margera, and skateboarder Jason Ellis.
* Musicians such as Joan Jett, Keith Morris of Black Flag, the B-52&#x27;s lead singer Fred Schneider, Marky Ramone of The Ramones, and New York Dolls singer David Johansen.
* Veteran DJs including New York City DJ Bruce Morrow, freeform radio pioneer Vin Scelsa, Richard Blade, Joe Causi and Kid Leo.
* Original MTV veejays Mark Goodman, Nina Blackwood, Alan Hunter and Martha Quinn.
* Hip Hop superstars Eminem and 50 Cent, along with veterans such as Grandmaster Flash, Kool DJ Red Alert, Kurtis Blow, and DJ Premier.
* Such popular dance music artists and DJs as Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyk, Liquid Todd, Pete Tong, The Riddler and DJ Icey.
* Political commentators including Bill Press, Andrew Wilkow, Mike Church, Rusty Humphries, Mike Malloy, Lynn Samuels, Glenn Beck, Michael Smerconish, and Sean Hannity.
* Comedians and satirists including Harry Shearer, Duane Cahill, Mojo Nixon, and Jim Breuer.
* Entertainment such as Cosmo and Maxim Radio featuring Covino and Rich.

===Sports===
Sirius also broadcast sports content. It had exclusive satellite radio broadcasting rights to all NFL, CFL and NBA games. In December 2005, Sirius announced a multi-year deal with the NBA. The agreement also created a 24-hour NBA Radio Channel. Sirius aired Full Court Press, an all-NBA show. On November 12, 2008, NBA games switched to XM and were replaced by Sporting News Radio. NHL games were shared with XM for the 2005–2006 season, and in 2007 Sirius/XM gained exclusive rights to NHL games. Sirius also had full NASCAR coverage, including a weekly show hosted by now-retired driver Tony Stewart. In 2009, Sirius/XM was the first to carry live coverage of the 24-hour road race from Le Mans.

Sirius/XM also had the rights to a number of major college sports teams, including teams in the Big East, Big Ten and Southeastern Conferences, as well as The University of Notre Dame. Beginning in 2005, Sirius also had exclusive radio rights to cover the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. In August 2004, Sirius launched &quot;Sirius NFL Radio&quot;, a 24-hour radio stream for covering the NFL.

Sirius also had the only national Horse racing talk show, &quot;At the Races&quot;, hosted by noted racing handicapper, Steve Byk.

&quot;The Hardcore Poker Show&quot;, hosted by Rob Pizzo and Chris Tessaro, was the only syndicated poker talk show in North America.

Sirius also broadcast select Premier League matches. On September 27, 2006, Sirius announced a deal to add UEFA Champions League soccer to their lineup. Sirius had exclusive radio rights to broadcast the ESPN television feed of the Euro 2008 championships. Sirius also aired a soccer talk show called &quot;The Football Show&quot; with former Metrostars GM Charlie Stillitano and former International Italian star Giorgio Chinaglia. On Saturdays and Sundays during premier league season, Sirius aired Radio &quot;606&quot;, a classic radio call-in show from the UK discussing all of the days top matches.

On September 15, 2008, Chris Russo launched his own show called &quot;Mad Dog Unleashed&quot;.

After the merger between Sirius and XM was completed, Major League Baseball games remained exclusive to XM Radio as a result of an arrangement dispute between MLB and Sirius XM, which prevented Sirius subscribers from listening to games. However, on August 19, 2013, Sirius XM reached an agreement with MLB allowing all customers with both Sirius and XM receivers to hear the games with a premium subscription.

===SiriusXM for Business===
In August 2003, Sirius partnered with Clearwater, Florida-based Applied Media Technologies Corporation, a provider of telephone &quot;on hold&quot; messaging. AMTC provides Sirius service in a package branded as &quot;Sirius Music for Business&quot;. For US$29.95 per month, AMTC provides all of Sirius&#x27; streams of commercial-free music, and pays all performance royalties to ASCAP, Broadcast Music Incorporated, and SESAC, so that business owners may legally play Sirius&#x27; music in their establishments.

Unlike the music services Muzak / DMX Music or Music Choice, the SiriusXM for Business service uses the same channels and SDARS delivery platform as the consumer Sirius service. The SDARS delivery platform, on the other hand, is more reliable than any of the other services in that it is not subject to satellite dish rain fade. The highly elliptical orbit of the Sirius satellite constellation can pose difficulties for the reliable delivery of the signal to stationary antennas in certain parts of the country. To eliminate this potential problem, Sirius launched a new geostationary satellite, FM-5, to improve service to non-mobile customers such as those of SiriusXM for Business. The service can also be accessed online using Sirius&#x27; online streaming technology, allowing any business with a broadband Internet connection to overcome any potential reception issues. Additionally, Sirius applied for repeaters in Hawaii and Alaska and has already been granted authority for 20 repeaters covering the island of Puerto Rico by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

===Sirius Backseat TV===
In March 2007, Sirius announced the availability of its first video service called &quot;Backseat TV&quot;. In August 2007, the company revealed details of the first receiver, the SCV1, was originally offered exclusively through Chrysler OEM factory units. The service includes streaming video from three &quot;family&quot; television channels: Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network Mobile. There is a single screen (or a dual screen option in the Chrysler Town and Country and Dodge Grand Caravan) for back seat passengers to watch while front seat passengers have the option of simultaneously listening to any normal Sirius radio channel. The service is reported to cost an additional US$6.99 per month on top of the standard Sirius subscription price. The MSRP of the factory installed units is US$470 and the aftermarket unit has an MSRP of US$299.99. Both were made available in the fourth quarter of 2007. As of 1 January 2016 the service has been discontinued.

===Other content===
In June 2005, Sirius signed an agreement with BBC Radio 1 in the UK to rebroadcast the station to an American audience. In August 2011, Sirius dropped BBC Radio 1, but a week later they announced that the channel would return online.

Sirius also had exclusive satellite radio rights to National Public Radio, carrying two separate streams. The Sirius NPR NOW programming did not include the popular programs All Things Considered and Morning Edition.

With the launch of Sirius Canada in December 2005, American listeners gained five Canadian-produced stations including CBC Radio One, CBC Radio Three and Iceberg Radio, and &quot;Première Plus&quot;, Énergie2, and &quot;Bande à part&quot; for French listeners. Iceberg Radio is programmed by Standard Broadcasting, which also provides a number of additional channels exclusive to Canada; the other four come from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After a delay and outcry from Canadian subscribers, Sirius Canada added Howard Stern&#x27;s Channel 100 to their lineup in early 2006. Channel 101, Stern&#x27;s other channel (featuring Bubba the Love Sponge, Scott Ferrall, and other personalities), were made available in late June 2006.

Talk radio content recently added onto Sirius Satellite Radio include the ABC News and Talk channel 143 (since having ceased operations), including live feeds of Sean Hannity and Larry Elder&#x27;s syndicated radio shows, Patriot Talk channel 125 (which includes Michael Reagan&#x27;s syndicated radio show) and Fox News Talk channel 145 (which includes syndicated radio hosts such as Alan Colmes and John Gibson).

On March 14, 2006, Sirius added Cosmo Radio, Playboy Radio, and returned the audio simulcast of the Fox News Channel TV feed, which was previously removed during a contract dispute. The service also added Fox&#x27;s satellite talk radio channel, Fox News Talk.

In April 2003, Sirius launched Sirius OutQ, the first-ever 24/7 talk channel designed for the LGBT audience. Personalities associated with the channel include Frank DeCaro, Michelangelo Signorile, Derek Hartley, and Romaine Patterson.

In addition to the audio programming, the Sirius broadcast stream also carries a &quot;Data Services&quot; channel that is utilized by capable receivers and graphical display hardware. Some of the data services offered are traffic speed and flow, marine weather, and fuel prices to name just a few. Examples of capable hardware are the Raymarine SR100 Satellite Weather receiver and the Alpine NVE-N872A Satellite Traffic Ready navigation system.

==Technology==
The Sirius signal is separated into three carriers, one each for the two satellites, and the third for the terrestrial repeater network where available. Sirius receivers decode all three 4 MHz carrier signals at once to achieve signal diversity. This is in contrast to XM which uses six carriers and decodes three 2 MHz carriers to economize on receiver power consumption and complexity at the cost of channel-changing speed. There is an intentional four-second delay between the two satellite carrier signals. This enables the receiver to maintain a large buffer of the audio stream, which, along with forward error correction, helps keep the audio playing in the event that the signal is temporarily lost, such as when driving under an overpass or otherwise losing line-of-sight of any of the satellites or ground repeater stations.

A third, separate signal is uplinked to the AMC-6 Ku-band satellite and received by satellite dishes for the ground repeater network. This third signal is broadcast on a third segment of the signal.

===Signal architecture and early prototypes===
The technology for Sirius Satellite Radio receivers as well as some of the uplink equipment, and the studio encoder, originated at Bell Labs in the late 1990s and subsequent years. The studio encoder was a result of Bell Labs&#x27; efforts in statistical multiplexing of perceptual audio coded signals, a cousin of the MP3 standards. The waveform design for the terrestrial and satellite signals, as well as the early prototype receivers, were implemented in an FPGA logic and tested in the field to verify the performance of the receivers. This work was contracted by Sirius to Lucent Technologies, at the time a spinoff of AT&amp;T. Early prototypes were followed by a number of generations of ASIC custom designed chipsets, supplied at first by Agere Systems and later supplied by Agere Systems and their competitor STMicroelectronics.

Three signals from three different sources (satellite, satellite, and terrestrial) are therefore combined in the receiver as radio signals, (not as audio signals). The three signals need to be combined constructively (avoiding situations where bad signals pollute good signals) in the receiver before being decoded. Heavy error correction is applied to the signals. All three signals contain the same audio content on all the channels that the receiver can receive, with the exception of one audio program waveform being transmitted ahead of the other two by approximately four seconds. With this time skew, the signals, once realigned, need to see an 8-second obstruction of overpass fade in order to lose audio content. This increases the robustness of the signal delivery in most driving conditions.

In order to recover meaningful signal and error-free audio from a signal impaired by interference and fading, the receiver uses concatenated Reed-Solomon block coding and Forward Error Correction encoding and decoding (codec). This technique was proven in the early days of satellite modems in the late 1970s. Linkabit, then run by Irwin Jacobs prior to his involvement with Qualcomm, offered such a codec for rack mounting in satellite earth stations. The Sirius signal uses more robust error correction on control channels than on the audio content, trading off error correction and bandwidth differently for separate categories of bits in the signal waveform.

The terrestrial carrier is an OFDM QPSK signal, and cousin to WiMax and LTE, with the particular feature that more than one transmitter operates on the same frequency, forming a single frequency network. A number of transmitters can be placed around a city to create coverage that is less subject to fading than if a single transmitter were used. The satellite signal is QPSK. Both satellite and terrestrial signals have hierarchical modulation superposed on the original signal, a measure created to add bandwidth at a small expense in the satellite link budget for decoding the core audio content.

This architecture has worked remarkably well in avoiding drop out of audio signal when driving under highway overpasses, and when scintillating (very deep and frequent losses in signal strength caused by radio fading from trees) conditions exist. Since Sirius and XM separately entered the market with incompatible waveforms on the satellite, one would logically conclude that the merged company will eventually evolve the signal format again to take advantage of their size, but this is a speculative statement. The use of a satellite and terrestrial combined service has been adopted by the DVB-SH standard, and companies such as ICO communications who cooperated with Alcatel-Lucent on system design and field trials. ONDAS, a Madrid-based company, also adopted this pioneering system architecture.

===Receiver technology===
The receiver is designed to mitigate and retain signal quality in hostile signal conditions and the relatively weak signal levels from distant satellites. Because the satellites are not all geostationary they appear and disappear over the horizon. Terrestrial signals are present only in major cities to augment the satellite signals.

Approximately five chipset versions were built by Agere and approximately 4 versions were built by STMicroelectronics after the initial prototypes, although all of the early receivers included an Agere chipset known as Northstar. This platform enjoyed the highest volume of chipsets to date, representing the bulk of total production from 2002 to 2010. As of 2010, most of the chipsets are produced by STMicroelectronics.

At the heart of a Sirius receiver is a custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip called the &quot;Baseband Integrated Circuit&quot; currently the STA240, which is produced by STMicroelectronics. The chip contains embedded ARM7TDMI and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from IP cores. Every baseband has a unique Electronic Serial Number (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom ASIC, the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315 GHz and downconverts them to intermediate frequency signals at around 75 MHz. The strength of the signals is approximately −50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, demodulated, error-corrected, de-interleaved, and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The baseband processor utilizes a 16MB SDRAM memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order to bring it into time coincidence with the other for Maximal-ratio combining. On newer receivers with a &quot;pause&quot; feature, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The baseband processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which is fed to a D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the &quot;head unit&quot;, required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.

Sirius offers car radios and home entertainment systems, as well as car and home kits for portable use. The Sirius receiver includes the antenna module and the receiver module. The antenna module picks up signals from the ground repeaters or the satellite, amplifies the signal and filters out any interference. The signal is then passed on to the receiver module. Inside the receiver module is a chipset consisting of eight chips. The chipset converts the signals from 2.3 gigahertz (GHz) to a lower intermediate frequency. Sirius also offers an adapter that allows conventional car radios to receive satellite signals.

Sirius broadcasts using 12.5 MHz of the S band between 2320 and 2332.5 MHz. Audio channels are digitally compressed using a proprietary variant of Lucent&#x27;s Perceptual Audio Coder compression algorithm and encrypted with a proprietary conditional access system. Sirius has announced that they intend to implement hierarchical modulation technology to economize on bandwidth up to 25%.

Each receiver must be connected to an external antenna, which is included with the receiver. Antenna placement is crucial to receiving a clear signal. In some locations users have experienced difficulty receiving the Sirius programming because the signal is not consistently strong. For the best reception, antennas should be placed such that they have an unobstructed view of the sky (preferably on rooftops without overhanging eaves or trees). If this is not an option, the antenna should be placed on an exterior wall. When placing on an exterior wall, the antenna should be mounted to a wall which faces the southern continental United States in order to minimize the likelihood of the building itself blocking the signal.

Sirius&#x27; satellites are named Radiosat because there is already a fleet of satellites named Sirius, launched by Sweden&#x27;s NSAB (Nordiska Satellitaktiebolaget, or Nordic Satellite AB, and known today as SES Sirius) and used for general telecommunications and satellite television throughout Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia.

The current primary uplink facility for Sirius, which was formerly used as the uplink site for Western Union&#x27;s Westar fleet of communication satellites from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, is located in Glenwood, New Jersey. The original facility was located on the roof of the building housing the Sirius studios in Rockefeller Center in New York City but has since been decommissioned.

Sirius&#x27; spacecraft Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 4 were manufactured by Space Systems/Loral. The first three of the series were orbited in 2000 by Proton K Block-DM3 launch vehicles, with the final three-satellite constellation completed on November 30, 2000. Radiosat 4, built as a ground spare for the now-decommissioned elliptical mission, was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum in October 2012. It is on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The satellites are based on the Space Systems/Loral 1300 platform. Before the elliptical satellites were decommissioned, all three satellites broadcast directly to the consumer&#x27;s receiver, but due to the highly elliptical orbit only two of them broadcast at any given time. Today the satellites are located in the southern sky in the United States.

Satellites Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 3, now decommissioned, fly in geosynchronous (not geostationary) Tundra orbits. Like the geostationary orbit, the tundra orbit has a period of 23 hours, 56 minutes (one sidereal day). Unlike the geostationary orbit, the tundra orbit is elliptical, not circular, and is inclined with respect to the equator rather than orbiting directly over it. The eccentric orbit ensures that each satellite spends about 16 hours of each day high over the continental United States. At least one satellite is always visible, with another often visible as well. The orbit&#x27;s high inclination places apogee just west of Hudson Bay in Canada, providing a much higher elevation angle for most of the country than is possible from a geostationary orbit. This was intended to reduce blockage from tall buildings in urban areas, allowing a much smaller terrestrial repeater network than does sister network XM, which uses geostationary orbits. This system has since been decommissioned in favor of newer geostationary satellites located at 96.0° and 116.15° that support both the Sirius and XM platforms.

On June 8, 2006, Space Systems/Loral announced that it was awarded a contract for the fifth Sirius spacecraft. The new spacecraft features a nine-meter unfurlable reflector. The first four Sirius spacecraft used more traditional parabolic reflectors. The new satellite has been designed for geostationary orbit, unlike the other satellites in the constellation; the different orbit has the stated purpose of allowing for more consistent reception for fixed location users (many subscribers have reported having to regularly reposition their antennas for optimal reception). Radiosat 5 (FM-5) is in a geostationary orbit at 96.0° West. It was launched June 30, 2009, and announced to be in service as of September 9, 2009.

On October 14, 2010, the XM-5 satellite was launched aboard an International Launch Services (ILS) Proton vehicle. It was placed into a geostationary orbit at 85.2° West to serve the eastern half of the United States. It is named XM-5 because it serves as an in-orbit spare that can replace both the Sirius Radiosat satellites and the XM satellites. The satellite was manufactured by Space Systems/Loral and was fully operational on December 3, 2010.

On February 29, 2008, the launch service provider International Launch Services (ILS) announced a contract which includes a launch of the SIRIUS FM-6 satellite on a Proton Briz M launch vehicle. The launch planned for March 6, 2012, was canceled due to concerns with a design defect in the solar panel deployment. The Radiosat 6 (FM-6) satellite was launched on October 25, 2013, and was put in a geostationary orbit at 116.15° West which services the western half of the United States.

==Receivers==
, Sirius receivers were available for various new Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Jaguar, Jeep, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mercury, MINI, Mitsubishi, Scion, Toyota (except Corolla), Porsche, Volkswagen, and Volvo vehicles, and the service plans on adding availability for portable use. Subaru offers Sirius on the Forester and Impreza. Starting in 2006, all Rolls-Royce vehicles sold in the United States came with a Sirius radio and lifetime subscription as standard equipment. Sirius had an exclusive contract for VW and Audi vehicles from 2007 through 2012, and with Kia Motors from 2008 through 2014, with an optional extension to 2017. Beginning in the 2007 model year, Bentley vehicles have had Sirius as an option, and it became standard equipment in several models beginning in 2008. Porsche switched to XM Satellite Radio on their vehicles beginning with the 2007 model year. Currently, only Toyota (including its Lexus and Scion divisions) and Subaru offer both Sirius and XM contracts (however both companies usually equip vehicles with XM).

Sirius also makes several receivers for aftermarket installations such as the Sportster4, Starmate Replay, Sirius S50 with a built-in 1GB MP3 player, and the Sirius One. Radios from Sirius include:
* Sportster 5 – plug and play radio with a color screen and one hour of storage
* Sirius Stiletto 100 – the first portable Sirius radio that allows subscribers to listen to live Sirius programming. The Stiletto boasts a 2 gigabyte memory, which is roughly equivalent to 100 hours of recording time. The unit&#x27;s batteries give the user approximately 30 hours of life. The unit also features Wi-Fi technology, which is used as a backup to stream music from the Internet when a clear signal strength is not readily available from the built-in antenna. Sirius&#x27; partnerships with Napster and Yahoo Music provide additional content for Stiletto users.
* Sirius Stiletto 10 -The &quot;feature&quot;-lite version to the Stiletto 100. The Stiletto 10 offers all that the Stiletto 100 offers but does not offer Wi-Fi, MP3/WMA playback and only offers 256 megabytes of storage space (about 10 hours of Sirius programming). The Stiletto 10 offers Artist and Song Seek – Not featured on the Stiletto 100 or Stiletto 2. This seek function watches for a driver&#x27;s favorite artists and songs that he or she wants to hear and will let him or her know when they are playing on any other station.
* Sirius Stiletto 2 – the newest portable Sirius radio. A slimmer, improved version of the Stilleto 100. Has a microSD slot behind the battery for storing MP3/WMA files and playlists (not Sirius content). Wi-Fi support expanded to handle WPA and WPA2 (non-Enterprise) with passcodes.
* Sportster 3 was the first radio to use the new universal dock station.
* Sirius S50 – the first portable Sirius radio – which is not a LIVE portable, it has to be plugged into a home or car dock where content can be downloaded for later listening. The RIAA through its efforts to amend the Audio Home Recording Act and its lawsuit against XM Radio has crippled the S50 as it tried to limit the number and quality of downloads available to consumers.
* Sirius Starmate ST1 (note: ST1C is the Canadian version)
* Sirius Starmate Replay ST2
* Sirius Sportster Exec. Docking Station Package
* Sirius Sportster Radio with Boombox Package
* Tivoli Sirius Table Radio
* Kenwood H2EV Radio with Car and Home Kits
* Clarion Calypso Sirius Radio with Car Kit
* XACT XTR1 Radio with Car Kit
* SiriusConnect for Pioneer SIR-PNR1 which can be modified to provide a Serial or USB Serial interface to control the radio.

===On-line media streaming options===
For an additional fee, Sirius subscribers are also able to access all of the proprietary music channels and most of the talk stations via streaming media through Sirius.com. A standard 64 kbit/s and &quot;Premium&quot; 128 kbit/s feed are available.

Alternatives to the browser-based player are available such as a Yahoo! Widget (designed to look like a miniature Sportster model receiver), and SIRIUS Internet Radio Player (based on Windows Media Player and available as a plug-in or standalone application). Both alternatives have gained popularity with streaming listeners, and offer artist and track name information updated in real time, which is an improvement from the online Sirius player.

Recently, SiriusXMStream has come available as a replacement to uSirius. It offers a server capability to stream Sirius and XM programming to game consoles and mobile phones as an alternative to the iPhone And Blackberry app.

NiceMac LLC, creator of the StarPlayr and StarLightXM product lines have created clients for Mac, PC, Windows Mobile and iPhone. The company merged with Millard Software and released a private beta of uSirius StarPlayr, a Sirius XM iPhone client, but on March 8, 2009, the beta was discontinued. Early 2019, StarPlayrX, an accessible and open source Swift version was released to Apple&#x27;s App Store.

CatPig Studios Inc. has also released Radium for Mac, a general-purpose internet radio player that supports XM and Sirius. In early 2010, Rogue Amoeba software released Pulsar, a standalone Sirius-XM player for Mac OS X.

In addition to being available through Sirius.com, Howard Stern&#x27;s website offers a Java application that streams the two Stern-themed channels. The site also states that Stern-specific video and audio clips would be made available at a later date.

===Apple iOS app===
Sirius XM has developed a software application for use on the Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices that allows its subscribers and users of those devices to listen to its programming. The application was released and available for download on the evening of June 17, 2009. The Sirius XM app is available at the iTunes App Store. Also integrated into the app is a &quot;click to buy&quot; function where if a user clicks any song title playing on Sirius XM they are given the option to be taken to the iTunes Music Store where they can purchase the track or album. Due to the terms of a new contract, the Howard Stern channels were added on Tuesday, December 21.

===Android app===
Sirius XM has developed a streaming app for the Android Smartphone platform. This app is available free of charge in the market, and requires an additional US$3.49/mo to subscribe to. The app features all of the content available on a standard Sirius receiver.

===BlackBerry app===
Sirius XM has also developed an application for use on certain 3G-enabled Rim BlackBerry smartphones. Much like its Apple counterpart, it features a restricted 120-channel lineup featuring most of the music channels and selected talk programming. As with the Apple app, some select programming, including MLB Play-by-Play, NFL Play-by-Play, SIRIUS NASCAR Radio are not available on the Blackberry. Shortly after signing a new contract, Howard Stern began promoting the mobile app, and his content was added to the mobile offerings.

Blackberry smartphones currently compatible with the Sirius app:
* BlackBerry Bold (excluding the 9900 and the 9930)
* BlackBerry Curve 83301
* BlackBerry Curve 8500
* BlackBerry Curve 8900
* BlackBerry Storm
* BlackBerry Storm 2
* BlackBerry Tour
1 If OS version is above 5.0.239

==In Canada==
In November 2004, a partnership between Sirius, Standard Broadcasting and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation filed an application with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to introduce Sirius in Canada. The application was approved on June 16, 2005. The decision was appealed to the Canadian federal cabinet by a number of broadcasting, labour, and arts and culture organizations, including the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, CHUM Limited, and the National Campus and Community Radio Association. The groups objected to Sirius&#x27; approach to and reduced levels of Canadian content and French-language programming, along with the exclusion of Canadian non-commercial broadcasting. After a lengthy debate, the cabinet rejected the appeals on September 9, 2005. Sirius Canada was officially launched December 1, 2005.

In 2006 it offered a lifetime plan to subscribers that for a $549 fee it would unlock the top tier channels for unlimited use on any Sirius device, including the Internet and phone. However, the company currently only offers at maximum, a three-year subscription.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has reported poor reception in northern Canada.

==In Puerto Rico==
In September 2009, The Federal Communications Commission agreed to Sirius XM&#x27;s request for a special temporary authority to operate 20 terrestrial repeaters for the satellite radio service in Puerto Rico.

The commission did so over the objections of the Puerto Rico Radio Broadcasters Association (Asociación de Radiodifusores de Puerto Rico), who said the approval expands the Sirius XM reach outside its authorized coverage area and would allow Sirius XM to compete with terrestrial broadcasters for listeners.

After receiving communications by public officials in opposition to the broadcasters, such as Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock, in rejecting those arguments, the commission said Sirius XM&#x27;s footprint already covers the island but the signal is weak and blocked by tall buildings and foliage. As for the impact on competition, the FCC said it has considered these arguments before and &quot;declined to find that&quot; satellite radio would harm local broadcasters.

The Sirius full terrestrial coverage is available in select sites in the cities of San Juan, Carolina, Bayamón, Cataño, Caguas and Ponce. In the rest of Puerto Rico, coverage is provided by Sirius&#x27; constellation of satellites.

==Sirius Internet Radio==
In October 2006, Sirius announced that it was launching a new service named Sirius Internet Radio (SIR) that offered approximately 75 of the 135 Sirius channels worldwide to people other than subscribers to its satellite radio service. Prior to this, Sirius subscribers who had a satellite radio were also able to access many of the Sirius channels via the Internet, using a special password, but the service operated at 32 kbit/s and was only available to those who purchased a satellite radio receiver. Sirius Internet Radio is an Internet-only subscription, allowing worldwide listeners to listen to the content without having to purchase a satellite radio receiver, the internet subscription can also be heard on Wi-Fi-enabled Internet radio for consumer and business purposes such as those designed by Grace Digital. The service also expands the number of channels that are available to Sirius Stiletto 100 users via Wi-Fi.

==Liberty Media Corporation investment==
As of February 11, 2009, Sirius XM had $3.25 billion in total debt and had until February 17, 2009, to repay $175 million in bonds held by EchoStar. EchoStar has been buying Sirius XM&#x27;s debt since an unsuccessful December 2008 takeover bid. Shares of Sirius XM had been trading for less than $1 from September 10, 2008, until February 2010.
The company announced in early February 2009 that it may file for bankruptcy &quot;as early as&quot; Tuesday, February 17, 2009.
On February 17, 2009, Sirius entered into an investment agreement with Liberty Media Corporation. Sirius received $550 million to pay maturing debt in exchange for 40% of its convertible preferred stock.

== Class action lawsuits ==
SiriusXM has been involved in several high-profile class action lawsuits.

* Hooker v. Sirius XM radio was settled with a settlement pool of US$35 million in response to claims that SiriusXM denies that the company used robocalling techniques targeting non-subscribers that had received calls from SiriusXM after leasing or buying a car.
* Blessing v. Sirius XM Class Action Suit – On August 25, 2011, the Court presiding over the lawsuit, &quot;Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.&quot;, approved a class action settlement. A federal judge approved a US$180 million class action lawsuit settlement with SiriusXM Satellite Radio that accuses SiriusXM of breaking the law by raising subscription rates following its 2008 merger. The settlement provided a number of benefits to current and former SiriusXM subscribers, including one free month of service.
* Turtles v. Sirius XM – SiriusXM paid up to US$99 million to settle a class action lawsuit filed by The Turtles after the satellite radio company spent years broadcasting songs recorded before 1972 without compensating labels or artists.

<text>The Pope Must Die (alternative known title as The Pope Must Diet! in the United States and Canada) is a 1991 British Catholic Church comedy film directed by Peter Richardson, who also wrote the screenplay with Pete Richens derived from elements of an earlier screenplay for a three-part mini-series satirising the Catholic Church, and which had been rejected by Channel 4. The film stars Robbie Coltrane as a low ranking priest who is mistakenly elected Pope, then has to avoid being assassinated by the Mafia. The film co-stars Adrian Edmondson, Annette Crosbie, Herbert Lom and Alex Rocco. The film was released by Palace Pictures with the backing of Channel 4 Films.

The film was originally planned as a part of a three-part mini-series for Channel 4, which was cancelled by the station after press outcry. This led Richardson to sever his long relationship with Channel 4 and move his future productions to the BBC. The budget for the film was later approved by Palace Pictures with the backing of Channel 4 Films.
The production was filmed in 1990 in Yugoslavia on a budget of £2.5 million.

The film&#x27;s subject matter was controversial, which caused the distributors serious difficulties with its promotion, London Transport refusing to carry advertising for it until the film&#x27;s posters were censored. In the United States the Big Three television networks refused to show commercials for the film, which they said was sacrilegious and offensive. Many newspapers in the US also censored or refused to carry advertising for the film.

==Plot==
The death of the previous Pope is followed by a conclave deadlocked for 25 days, until the Mafia&#x27;s tame Cardinal Rocco persuades the College of Cardinals to elect &quot;in absentia&quot; the Mafia&#x27;s favoured candidate, Albini (Janez Vajevec), whose absence Rocco passes off as him working tirelessly for environmental concerns.

Fr. Rookie is hard of hearing and records the pope-elect as &quot;Cardinal Albinizi&quot;. Cardinal David &quot;Dave&quot; Albinizi is an honest parish priest who becomes Pope and takes the name of Pope David I. He is an unorthodox priest, with a benign interest in cars, women and rock and roll. He had worked in an orphanage, where he took an interest in the children and wished them to enjoy the gospel, as opposed to the curmudgeonly nuns who believed misery is deserved. Inside the Vatican, the Pope gets along with Bish, a priest in charge of coordinating his security, and with the nun assigned to bring his meals. He considers abdicating after a failed assassination attempt but is convinced by the nun to stay. After a journalist asks about corruption inside the Vatican bank the Pope demands to see the accounts. Upon the previous pope&#x27;s death Bish had received a disk about the financial irregularities which he gives to the pope. The Pope discovers the gun-smuggling and stolen merchandise operations, and has Rocco defrocked. Rocco has his mafia backers intensify the efforts to assassinate Pope David.

Looking with the papal chamberlain Monsignor Fitchie for material with which to blackmail the Pope, Cardinal Rocco finds that before joining the priesthood, Albinizi fathered a son with American tourist Veronica Dante. Albinizi joined the priesthood because Veronica did not want to stay with him. Veronica never informed Albinizi of their son, who is now rock star Joe Don Dante, dating Corelli&#x27;s daughter Luccia. Corelli doesn&#x27;t approve of the relationship and sends thugs to kill Joe. The bomb kills Luccia and seriously wounds Joe. Pope David learns about his son and visits him before Joe dies.

Learning that the Vatican Bank is a tool of the Mafia, Pope David has it dissolved. He is forced to resign when his affair is revealed, and Corelli&#x27;s candidate Albini is elected Pope. Corelli and Albini move into the papal apartments. Albinizi reunites with Veronica and finds out that the orphanage where he worked has closed. He reads about Albini becoming pope and rushes back to the Vatican and asks Bish for help to stop the coronation. They encounter a dying Cardinal Rocco, shot by Corelli. While Bish continues to the papal apartments, Albinizi hears Rocco&#x27;s confession (interrupted by a phone call from Rocco&#x27;s female partner). Albinizi finds Bish tied up, but Bish tells Albinizi to stop the imminent coronation rather than freeing him. Monsignor Fitchie frees Bish as Albinizi rushes to the Sistine Chapel just before the ceremony ends, and reveals that the man calling himself Albini is actually Corelli in disguise. Corelli declares himself &quot;Pope Vittorio I, Emperor of the Vatican&quot; and draws a gun. He fires a few shots at the ceiling, which collapses onto him. The nun who had served Albinizi as pope is chosen as the first female Pope in history. She announces she will give the Vatican&#x27;s gold to the world&#x27;s poor, and gives her blessing for Albinizi to take a bride. Bish officiates at Albinizi and Veronica&#x27;s wedding. They adopt the children from the orphanage in addition to having children of their own.

==Production==

===Development===
In 1988, Richardson pitched a proposal for a three-part mini-series to Channel 4&#x27;s Commissioning Editor for Entertainment, Seamus Cassidy. The script, co-written with Pete Richens was based around the conspiracy theories surrounding the deaths of Pope John Paul I and &quot;God&#x27;s Banker&quot; Roberto Calvi. At the planning stages Alexei Sayle was proposed to star as &#x27;Pope Dave the First&#x27; and Robbie Coltrane, Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French were also said to be involved. &quot;The Observer&quot; reported &quot;The programmes would have been in the form of a parody of an American mini-series, which portrayed a modern-day Pope and his rule across two continents.&quot; The budget was said to be tabled at £1.5 million.

Plans for the series were discovered by the press, and on 28 August 1988 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ran a short article entitled &quot;Row over papal satire&quot;. The story was taken up by &quot;Catholic Herald&quot;, &quot;The Universe&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; and the &quot;Sun&quot;, linking the project to the furore over Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; which at the time had been boycotted by the Catholic Church. Cassidy took soundings from senior colleagues including Chief Executive Michael Grade, and Director of Programmes, Liz Forgan. Spokespeople from Channel 4 at first defended the production, denying it would be blasphemous, but when they came under increasing scrutiny they cancelled the project after advice from their lawyers. Instead they decided to commission one of Richardson&#x27;s pet projects, a sequel to the &quot;Five Go Mad...&quot; Comic Strip films, entitled, &quot;Five Go To Hell&quot;. This project had originally been shelved due to the poor box office takings of Richardson&#x27;s previous film &quot;Eat The Rich&quot;. However &quot;Five Go To Hell&quot; to date has never been filmed.

After the controversy, Richardson took the Comic Strip Presents to the BBC, reportedly because Alan Yentob was more accommodating to his ideas. He began work on another series of Comic Strip films for the channel. Two parts of the mini series were heavily re-written and appeared as episodes of the 1990 Comic Strip series, as &quot;Oxford&quot; and &quot;Spaghetti Hoops&quot; (which featured the story of Roberto Calvi). The remainder of the material was also rewritten and submitted to Palace Pictures, who produced the film with the backing of Channel 4. A production budget of £2.5 million was approved.

===Filming===
Filming began in late 1990. and took place on location in Yugoslavia, where John Ebden, the production designer, constructed studio sets of the Sistine Chapel and other Vatican landmarks.
The title of the film was deemed too sensitive to be disclosed to the Yugoslavians; its working title was &quot;Sleeping With the Fishes.&quot;

==Release==
The film opened on 21 June 1991 in 170 screens across the United Kingdom. It took £534,614 in its opening week and went on to earn over £1.1 million ($1,737,740) on its UK release. 
It was released in the U.S. on 2 September 1991 on a limited release across 169 screens, taking $264,147 on opening week and grossing $582,510. The film also had limited distribution in Germany where it grossed DEM 367,603 ($224,520). The film struggled to make back its £2.5 million budget, grossing $2,544,770 overall (approximately £1.7 million).

===Marketing===
Daniel Battsek (then managing director of Palace Pictures, which produced the film) experienced trouble over the film&#x27;s promotion, when London Transport banned the movie&#x27;s posters from the London Underground. &#x27;At first they said the theme of the film was liable to cause offense,&quot; said Battsek. &quot;When I explained the story, they admitted it was the title. We compromised with a poster saying &quot;Robbie Coltrane in The Pope.&quot;&#x27; The film also caused controversy when it opened in the Republic of Ireland that August. The film encountered more serious problems with promotion on its US release, with many newspapers refusing to include adverts, and CBS, NBC and ABC refusing to air television adverts for the film. Reasons cited for this were the sacrilegious tone of the film and advertising and the possible offence this would cause to readers and audiences. A CBS spokesperson said &quot;The decision was made because the title and content would be offensive to a significant portion of our audience.&quot; whilst NBC responded &quot;We feel (our viewers) would be seriously offended due to the ads&#x27; sacrilegious nature&quot; 
12 other cities newspapers accepted advertising only after the content had been heavily censored. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; accepted an advert that read &quot;The Pope Must. . . .&quot; &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; requested changes in certain captions under photos in the ad. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Sun-Times&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; were among the few newspapers which accepted advertising without alterations.

&quot;There is a separation of church and state in this country. My question is, on what grounds have they banned these ads? It seems curious that all three (networks) are taking the same tack,&quot; said Russell Schwartz, Miramax executive vice president. &quot;Obviously they can do what they want, they are private institutions. It just raises some interesting issues as to why, when it comes to religion, the response is so unilateral.&quot;

===Critical reception===
On its limited release in the United States, the film received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote &quot;The movie&#x27;s basic comic approach is disrespect for the church, which almost by definition cannot be funny. To deflate a comic character, it has to first be inflated, and &quot;The Pope Must Die&quot; makes the crucial error of denying its characters dignity - so that there&#x27;s no reason for us to laugh when it&#x27;s taken away from them.&quot; Although he conceded &quot;Robbie Coltrane is a British comic actor of genuine talent, but he seems under a compulsion to make bad comedies about the Catholic church&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was more enthusiastic, writing &quot;The film is irreverent, boisterous and enjoyable even when the gags hang fire.&quot; He also praised Coltrane&#x27;s performance, saying he &quot;is very good, but the performance is somewhat restrained by the screenplay&#x27;s demand that the character ultimately be heroic. In this kind of comedy, rascality gets most of the laughs.&quot; The &quot;Time Out&quot; film guide article says &quot;There are many good laughs, albeit of a rather simple-minded nature, but even by its own ludicrous standards the plot unravels helplessly towards the end&quot; and called the film &quot;A pontiff&#x27;s egg.&quot; (a play on the phrase a curate&#x27;s egg). The film has a 33% (rotten) rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on six reviews.

<text>Downtempo (or downbeat) is a broad label for electronic music that features an atmospheric sound and slower beats than would typically be found in dance music. Closely related to ambient music but with greater emphasis on rhythm, the style may be played in relaxation clubs or as &quot;warm-up or cool-down&quot; music during a DJ set. Examples of downtempo subgenres include trip hop, ambient house, chillwave, psybient and lofi hip hop.

The style emerged in the late 1980s with the UK&#x27;s Bristol scene that birthed artists like Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky. In the 1990s, the style was heard internationally in artists such as Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister, Fila Brazillia, and Thievery Corporation. Other prominent artists to emerge in the style include Underworld, Orbital, Fluke, Boards of Canada, Nicolas Jaar, and Bonobo.

==Characteristics==
Downtempo music is a broad genre but is united by several characteristics:
*Atmospheric sound: artists focus more on layered sounds and mood than on catchy melodies or riffs
*Slow beats: songs typically feature beats around 90 BPM
*Gentle melodies: artists typically include more melodic phrases than straightforward ambient music
== History ==

Downtempo emerged from the UK&#x27;s late-1980s Bristol sound, which developed a slow, psychedelic fusion of hip hop with electronic music known as &quot;trip hop&quot; and birthed artists such as Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky. The 1990s brought on a wave of slower paced music which was played throughout chillout rooms—the relaxation sections of the clubs or dedicated sections at electronic music events. UK act Nightmares on Wax helped to pioneer downtempo electronica in the early 1990s, drawing on dub reggae and hip-hop. Downtempo music also started to surface around Ibiza, when DJs and promoters would bring down the vibe with slower rhythm and gentler electronic music upon approaching sunrise. At the end of the 1990s a more melodic instrumental electronica incorporating acoustic sounds with electronic styles emerged under its own umbrella name of downtempo.

In the late 1990s, the Austrian duo Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister popularized the style with their downtempo remixes of pop, hip-hop, and drum and bass tracks with influences of the &#x27;70s soul jazz. Britons Steve Cobby and Dave McSherry, producing under the name Fila Brazillia, released a handful of downtempo, electronica and ambient techno albums that propelled the style further. Meanwhile, the Washington, D.C. locals Eric Hilton and Rob Garza, better known as Thievery Corporation, have introduced the Brazilian sound into the style after discussing the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim, and enriched it further by combining elements of Jamaican dub and reggae.

In 2010, &quot;downtempo pop&quot; was described by &quot;The Atlantic&quot; as a variety of music styles from the 2000s characterized by mellow beats, vintage synthesizers, and lo-fi melodies. In other words, an umbrella term that includes chillwave, glo-fi, and hypnagogic pop. Later in the decade, another form of downtempo music, tagged as &quot;lo-fi hip hop&quot; or &quot;chillhop&quot;, became popular among YouTube music streamers.

<doc id="345133" wikidata="Q1646534" url="?curid=345133" title="Nat Fleischer">
<text>Nathaniel Stanley Fleischer (November 3, 1887 – June 25, 1972) was a noted American boxing writer and collector.

==Career==
Fleischer was born in New York City. After he graduated from City College of New York in 1908, Fleischer worked for the &quot;New York Press&quot; while studying at New York University. He served as the sports editor of the &quot;Press&quot; and the &quot;Sun Press&quot; until 1929. Encouraged by Tex Rickard, he inaugurated in 1922 &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. In 1929 Fleischer acquired sole ownership of the magazine, which he led as editor-in-chief for fifty years, until his death at Atlantic Beach, New York in 1972.

In 1942, Fleischer began to publish the magazine&#x27;s annual record book and boxing encyclopedia, which was published until 1987. In addition, Fleischer wrote several other books about the lives of some world champions and about boxing history.

Fleischer contributed to the founding of the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) and was twice presented with its James J. Walker Award. After Fleischer&#x27;s death, the BWAA named an award after him. Fleischer, who had been instrumental in creating &quot;The Ring&quot; Boxing Hall of Fame in 1954 (disbanded in 1987), was himself an inaugural 1990 inductee to the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Carruthers-Songkitrat match==

In 1954, Fleischer was involved with the &quot;Bare-footed Title Fight&quot;, a world championship bout fought in Thailand&#x27;s open air Chulalongkorn Stadium during a tropical monsoon.

Thai General Pichai invited Fleischer as a special guest to his homeland, as a way to ensure that the World Bantamweight Championship bout, between champion Jimmy Carruthers of Australia and challenger Chamroen Songkitrat, would follow the international boxing rules. It rained on the day of the fight, and 60,000 people (including the boxers) were drenched. Fleischer suggested the fight be postponed and that they wait to see if the weather would get better the next day, but General Pichai ordered the bout to take place, reasoning that it would be hard to send off 60,000 people and the other thousands who were stranded outside under the pouring rain, to have them return the next day. In an effort to better their traction in the flooded ring, this became the first recorded match in modern world boxing history where the fighters removed their footwear. Carruthers retained his crown by decision, and retired shortly after.

==Ali-Liston rematch==
Fleischer was seated at ringside on May 25, 1965, at the heavyweight championship rematch between Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston in Lewiston, Maine to report on the contest for &quot;The Ring&quot;. Fleischer played a role in the strange and controversial ending of the fight. When Liston went down in the first round from Ali&#x27;s infamous &#x27;anchor punch,&quot; Ali did not go to a neutral corner. Instead he circled near the fallen Liston, taunting him to get up shouting &quot;Nobody will believe this!&quot;. By the time Liston did rise to continue the fight, he had been on the canvas for more than ten seconds. Fleischer yelled at referee Jersey Joe Walcott (the former heavyweight titlist) to inform him that the knockdown timekeeper&#x27;s count had reached ten with Liston still on the canvas. Walcott improperly declared Ali the winner by knockout even though he had not gone to a neutral corner. By rule, if a fighter delays going to a neutral corner after scoring a knockdown, the count is not to start until he gets there.

==Fleischer and lineal titles==
As editor of &quot;The Ring&quot;, Fleischer believed that professional boxing titles had to be won and lost within the ring. His policy in recognizing world champions followed a principle that a fighter could not be stripped of a title by any state or national boxing commission. (A title could only be vacated by a champion who retired, died, or voluntarily relinquished the crown to fight in a different weight class.) This policy was severely tested in 1967 with Muhammad Ali. Ali had won the world heavyweight championship by dethroning Sonny Liston in 1964. As part of the antiwar movement in the United States during the Vietnam era, Muhammad Ali lost his world heavyweight crown in the eyes of most American boxing commissions when he refused to be inducted in the U.S. Army. Despite Ali possessing no boxing license in the United States and no passport to travel outside America to fight, &quot;The Ring&quot; continued to list Ali as the rightful world champion in its heavyweight rankings until 1970 when Ali informed Fleischer he was retiring from boxing. (Ironically, later that same year Ali won a court victory that allowed him to box again.) Fleischer&#x27;s continued recognition of Ali as world champion for more than two years was considered controversial. Many boxing fans at the time criticized &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s policy—and Fleischer specifically—for continuing to list Ali as world heavyweight champion while he was inactive. Despite its recognition of Ali as world champion, &quot;The Ring&quot; continued to commonly refer to him as Cassius Clay or Clay/Ali until the early 1970s.

<doc id="345141" wikidata="Q7247760" url="?curid=345141" title="Product detector">
<text>A product detector is a type of demodulator used for AM and SSB signals. Rather than converting the envelope of the signal into the decoded waveform like an envelope detector, the product detector takes the product of the modulated signal and a local oscillator, hence the name. A product detector is a frequency mixer.

Product detectors can be designed to accept either IF or RF frequency inputs. A product detector which accepts an IF signal would be used as a demodulator block in a superheterodyne receiver, and a detector designed for RF can be combined with an RF amplifier and a low-pass filter into a direct-conversion receiver.

==A simple product detector==
The simplest form of product detector mixes (or heterodynes) the RF or IF signal with a locally derived carrier (the Beat Frequency Oscillator, or BFO) to produce an audio frequency copy of the original audio signal and a mixer product at twice the original RF or IF frequency. This high-frequency component can then be filtered out, leaving the original audio frequency signal.

===Mathematical model of the simple product detector===
If &quot;m&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the original message, the AM signal can be shown to be 
:formula_1
Multiplying the AM signal &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) by an oscillator at the same frequency as and in phase with the carrier yields 
:formula_2
which can be re-written as
:formula_3

After filtering out the high-frequency component based around cos(2ω&quot;t&quot;) and the DC component &quot;C&quot;, the original message will be recovered.

===Drawbacks of the simple product detector===
Although this simple detector works, it has two major drawbacks:

* The frequency of the local oscillator must be the same as the frequency of the carrier, or else the output message will fade in and out in the case of AM, or be frequency shifted in the case of SSB
* Once the frequency is matched, the phase of the carrier must be obtained, or else the demodulated message will be attenuated, but the noise will not be.

The local oscillator can be synchronized with the carrier using a phase-locked loop in a synchronous detector arrangement. For SSB, the only solution is to construct a highly stable oscillator.

==Another example==

There are many other kinds of product detectors as well, which are practical if one has access to digital signal processing equipment. For instance, it is possible to multiply the incoming signal by the carrier, times the square of another carrier 90° out of phase with it. This will produce a copy of the original message, and another AM signal at the fourth harmonic, by means of the trigonometric identity

:formula_4

The high-frequency component can again be filtered out, leaving the original signal.

===Mathematical model of the detector===
If &quot;m&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the original message, the AM signal can be shown to be 
:formula_1
Multiplying the AM signal by the new set of frequencies yields
:formula_6
::formula_7
::formula_8

After filtering out the component based around cos(4ω&quot;t&quot;) and the DC component C, the original message will be recovered.

==A more sophisticated product detector==
A more sophisticated product detector can be constructed in a way much like a single-sideband modulator. Two copies of the modulated input signals are created. The first copy is mixed with a local oscillator and low-pass filtered. The second copy is mixed with a 90° phase-shifted copy of the oscillator and the output of this mixer is also 90° phase-shifted and then low-pass filtered. These copies are then combined to produce the original message. This operation is similar to that performed by a dual-phase lock-in amplifier.
Example: I-Q Demodulator

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The product demodulator has some advantages over an envelope detector for AM signal reception. 
* The product demodulator can decode overmodulated AM and AM with suppressed carrier.
* A signal demodulated with a product detector will have a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the same signal demodulated with an envelope detector.
On the other hand, the envelope detector is a simple and relatively inexpensive circuit, and it can provide higher fidelity, since there is no possibility of mistuning the local oscillator.

A product detector (or equivalent) is needed to demodulate SSB signals.</text><links>

<doc id="345143" wikidata="Q3874076" url="?curid=345143" title="Neal Walk">
<text>Neal Eugene Walk (July 29, 1948 – October 4, 2015) was an American college and professional basketball player who was a center in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for eight seasons during the late 1960s and 1970s, playing overseas afterward. Walk played college basketball for the University of Florida, and remains the Florida Gators&#x27; all-time rebounds leader. The Phoenix Suns picked Walk second overall in the 1969 NBA draft, having lost the coin toss with the Milwaukee Bucks for Lew Alcindor. Walk played professionally for the Suns, the New Orleans Jazz and the New York Knicks of the NBA.

== Early life ==

Walk was born in Cleveland, Ohio to a Jewish family, and moved to Miami Beach, Florida, with his parents Al and Sylvia at the age of 6. He attended Miami Beach High School, and played high school basketball for the Miami Beach Hi-Tides, starting for the first time in his senior year. His high school team made the state semifinals and due to its makeup of mostly Jewish players, it sometimes was subjected to opposing fans yelling anti-Semitic comments at them.

== College career ==

Walk accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Tommy Bartlett&#x27;s Florida Gators men&#x27;s basketball team for three seasons from 1966 to 1969. In his junior season, Walk led the NCAA with 19.8 rebounds a game and averaged 26.5 points per game. As a senior team captain, he led the Gators to the 1969 National Invitation Tournament—their first-ever post-season tournament. When Walk graduated from Florida, he was the Gators&#x27; all-time leading scorer, and still maintains the team records for career rebounds (1,181), average points per game (20.8), and rebounds in a single game (31), among others. His No. 41 jersey remains the only number to have been retired by the Florida basketball program.

He won a silver medal at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel for Team USA alongside Ronald Green, Steve Kaplan, and Jack Langer.

== Professional career ==

Walk was drafted in the first round (second pick overall) of the 1969 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns, after they lost a coin toss with the Milwaukee Bucks for the number one pick, which turned out to be Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). In an interview with author Charley Rosen near the end of his life, Walk commented on his perception as one of the league&#x27;s great &quot;booby prizes&quot;, saying &quot;I never paid attention to that bullshit. How many guys would love to be the second overall pick?&quot;

Milwaukee Bucks forward Curtis Perry, a teammate of Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s, described Walk&#x27;s career high 42 point game against the Bucks on January 11, 1972, as &quot;Talent meeting the moment, a harmonic convergence.&quot;

He played for the Suns from 1969 to 1974, averaging a career best 20.2 points per game and 12.4 rebounds per game in the 1972–73 season. Walk was traded to the then New Orleans Jazz, and subsequently traded to the New York Knicks, where he played for two seasons. Afterward, he went to play in Venice, Italy, then in Israel with Hapoel Ramat Gan, playing for the team for three seasons.

Walk is the only Suns player besides Charles Barkley to average 20 points and 12 rebounds in a season.

== Life after the NBA ==
After Walk retired, he legally changed his first name to Joshua.

In 1988, while Walk was living in Phoenix, it was discovered that Walk had a benign tumor enveloping his spine. Following surgery Walk was left in a wheelchair, from which he played wheelchair basketball for the L.A.-Phoenix Samaritans in the Southern California league of the National Wheelchair Basketball Association. In 1990 Walk was honored at the White House by U.S. President George H. W. Bush, as the &quot;Wheelchair Athlete of The Year&quot;.

He later worked for the Phoenix Suns in the Community Affairs department.

Walk is featured in the Miami Beach Senior High School Hall of Fame, a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2006.

On October 4, 2015, Walk died of an unspecified blood disease.

<text>The Indigenous languages of Australia number in the hundreds, the precise number being quite uncertain, although there is a range of estimates from a minimum of around 250 (using the technical definition of &#x27;language&#x27; as non-mutually intelligible varieties) up to possibly 363. The Indigenous languages of Australia comprise numerous language families and isolates, perhaps as many as 13, spoken by the Indigenous peoples of mainland Australia and a few nearby islands. The relationships between the language families are not clear at present although there are proposals to link some into larger groupings. Despite this uncertainty, the Indigenous Australian languages are collectively covered by the technical term &quot;Australian languages&quot;, or the &quot;Australian family&quot;.

The term can include both Tasmanian languages and the Western Torres Strait language, but the genetic relationship to the mainland Australian languages of the former is unknown, while the latter is Pama–Nyungan, though it shares features with the neighbouring Papuan, Eastern Trans-Fly languages, in particular Meriam Mir of the Torres Strait Islands, as well as the Papuan Tip Austronesian languages. Most Australian languages belong to the widespread Pama–Nyungan family, while the remainder are classified as &quot;non-Pama–Nyungan&quot;, which is a term of convenience that does not imply a genealogical relationship.

In the late 18th century there were more than 250 distinct First Nations Peoples social groupings and a similar number of languages or varieties. The status and knowledge of Aboriginal languages today varies greatly. Many languages became extinct with settlement as the encroachment of colonial society broke up Indigenous cultures. For some of these languages, few records exist for vocabulary and grammar. At the start of the 21st century, fewer than 150 Aboriginal languages remained in daily use, with the majority being highly endangered. In 2020, 90 per cent of the barely more than 100 languages still spoken are considered endangered. Thirteen languages are still being transmitted to children. The surviving languages are located in the most isolated areas. Of the five least endangered Western Australian Aboriginal languages, four belong to the Western Desert grouping of the Central and Great Victoria Desert.

Yolŋu languages from north-east Arnhem Land are also currently learned by children. Bilingual education is being used successfully in some communities. Seven of the most widely spoken Australian languages, such as Warlpiri, Murrinh-patha and Tiwi, retain between 1,000 and 3,000 speakers. Some Indigenous communities and linguists show support for learning programmes either for language revival proper or for only &quot;post-vernacular maintenance&quot; (Indigenous communities having the opportunity to learn some words and concepts related to the lost language).

==Classification==
===Internal===
Most Australian languages are commonly held to belong to the Pama–Nyungan family, a family accepted by most linguists, with Robert M. W. Dixon as a notable exception. For convenience, the rest of the languages, all spoken in the far north, are commonly lumped together as &quot;Non-Pama–Nyungan&quot;, although this does not necessarily imply that they constitute a valid clade. Dixon argues that after perhaps 40,000 years of mutual influence, it is no longer possible to distinguish deep genealogical relationships from areal features in Australia, and that not even Pama–Nyungan is a valid language family.

However, few other linguists accept Dixon&#x27;s thesis. For example, Kenneth L. Hale describes Dixon&#x27;s scepticism as an erroneous phylogenetic assessment which is &quot;such an insult to the eminently successful practitioners of Comparative Method Linguistics in Australia, that it positively demands a decisive riposte&quot;. Hale provides pronominal and grammatical evidence (with suppletion) as well as more than fifty basic-vocabulary cognates (showing regular sound correspondences) between the proto-Northern-and-Middle Pamic (pNMP) family of the Cape York Peninsula on the Australian northeast coast and proto-Ngayarta of the Australian west coast, some apart, to support the Pama–Nyungan grouping, whose age he compares to that of Proto-Indo-European.

Johanna Nichols suggests that the northern families may be relatively recent arrivals from Maritime Southeast Asia, perhaps later replaced there by the spread of Austronesian. That could explain the typological difference between Pama–Nyungan and non-Pama–Nyungan languages, but not how a single family came to be so widespread. Nicholas Evans suggests that the Pama–Nyungan family spread along with the now-dominant Aboriginal culture that includes the Australian Aboriginal kinship system.

In late 2017, Mark Harvey and Robert Mailhammer published a study in &quot;Diachronica&quot; that hypothesised, by analysing noun class prefix paradigms across both Pama-Nyungan and the minority non-Pama-Nyungan languages, that a Proto-Australian could be reconstructed from which all known Australian languages descend. This Proto-Australian language, they concluded, would have been spoken about 12,000 years ago in northern Australia.

===External===
For a long time unsuccessful attempts were made to detect a link between Australian and Papuan languages, the latter being represented by those spoken on the coastal areas of New Guinea facing the Torres Strait and the Arafura Sea. In 1986 William A. Foley noted lexical similarities between Robert M. W. Dixon&#x27;s 1980 reconstruction of proto-Australian and the East New Guinea Highlands languages. He believed that it was naïve to expect to find a single Papuan or Australian language family when New Guinea and Australia had been a single landmass (called the Sahul continent) for most of their human history, having been separated by the Torres Strait only 8000 years ago, and that a deep reconstruction would likely include languages from both. Dixon, in the meantime, later abandoned his proto-Australian proposal.

===Families===

===History===
In 1962, Arthur Capell gave his assessment of the origins and internal grouping of Aboriginal languages. He referred to many attempts having been made to link the Australian languages to other parts of the world, including the Dravidian languages of South India, those of the Andaman Islands, and African languages. &quot;All must be regarded as failures. In fact, it seems quite possible to explain the multiple forms of languages in Australia on the basis of a single original.&quot;

Capell proposed 5 main groupings as clear at the time, referring to earlier classifications by Schmidt (1914–19) and Kroeber (1923):

# Prefixing languages (Kimberleys and north Australia)
# Western Desert Languages
# Aranda (Arrernte)(Central Australia)
# Victoria with New South Wales south coastal region
# Unclassified groups occupying the bulk of Queensland and New South Wales.

==Survival==
It has been inferred from the probable number of languages and the estimate of pre-contact population levels that there may have been from 3,000 to 4,000 speakers on average for each of the 250 languages. A number of these languages were almost immediately wiped out within decades of colonisation, the case of the Aboriginal Tasmanians being one notorious example of precipitous linguistic ethnocide. Tasmania had been separated from the mainland at the end of the Quaternary glaciation, and Indigenous Tasmanians remained isolated from the outside world for around 12,000 years. Claire Bowern has concluded in a recent study that there were twelve Tasmanian languages, and that those languages are unrelated (that is, not demonstrably related) to those on the Australian mainland.

In 1990 it was estimated that 90 languages still survived of the approximately 250 once spoken, but with a high rate of attrition as elders died out. Of the 90, 70% by 2001 were judged as &#x27;severely endangered&#x27; with only 17 spoken by all age groups, a definition of a &#x27;strong&#x27; language. On these grounds it is anticipated that despite efforts at linguistic preservation, many of the remaining languages will disappear within the next generation. The overall trend suggests that in the not too distant future all of the Indigenous languages will be lost, perhaps by 2050, and with them the cultural knowledge they convey.

During the period of the Stolen Generations, Aboriginal children were removed from their families and placed in institutions where they were punished for speaking their Indigenous language. Different, mutually unintelligible language groups were often mixed together, with Australian Aboriginal English or Australian Kriol language as the only lingua franca. The result was a disruption to the inter-generational transmission of these languages that severely impacted their future use. Today, that same transmission of language between parents and grandparents to their children is a key mechanism for reversing language shift. For children, proficiency in the language of their cultural heritage has a positive influence on their ethnic identity formation, and it is thought to be of particular benefit to the emotional well-being of Indigenous children. There is some evidence to suggest that the reversal of the Indigenous language shift may lead to decreased self-harm and suicide rates among Indigenous youth.

The first Aboriginal people to use Australian Aboriginal languages in the Australian parliament were Aden Ridgeway on 25 August 1999 in the Senate when he said &quot;On this special occasion, I make my presence known as an Aborigine and to this chamber I say, perhaps for the first time: &quot; (Translation: My father is Dhunghutti. My mother is Gumbayynggir. And, therefore, I am Gumbayynggir.) In the House of Representatives on 31 August 2016 Linda Burney gave an acknowledgment of country in Wiradjuri in her first speech and was sung in by Lynette Riley in Wiradjuri from the public gallery.

2019 was the International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL2019), as declared by the United Nations General Assembly. The commemoration was used to raise awareness of and support for the preservation of Aboriginal languages within Australia, including spreading knowledge about the importance of each language to the identity and knowledge of Indigenous groups. Warrgamay/Girramay man Troy Wyles-Whelan joined the North Queensland Regional Aboriginal Corporation Language Centre (NQRACLC) in 2008, and has been contributing oral histories and the results of his own research to their database. As part of the efforts to raise awareness of Wiradjuri language a &quot;Grammar of Wiradjuri language&quot; was published in 2014 and &quot;A new Wiradjuri dictionary&quot; in 2010.

The New South Wales &quot;Aboriginal Languages Act 2017&quot; became law on 24 October 2017 and established a board to advise on the preservation of Aboriginal languages that is known as the Aboriginal Languages Trust. It was the first legislation in Australia to acknowledge the significance of first languages.

In 2019 the Royal Australian Mint issued a 50-cent coin to celebrate the International Year of Indigenous Languages which features 14 different words for &quot;money&quot; from Australian Indigenous languages. The coin was designed by Aleksandra Stokic in consultation with Indigenous language custodian groups.

The work of digitising and transcribing many word lists created by ethnographer Daisy Bates in the 1900s at Daisy Bates Online provides a valuable resource for those researching especially Western Australian languages, and some languages of the Northern Territory and South Australia. The project is co-ordinated by Nick Thieberger, who works in collaboration with the National Library of Australia &quot;to have all the microfilmed images from Section XII of the Bates papers digitised&quot;. The project is succeeded by the Nyingarn Project
, which digitises manuscripts and crowdsources transcriptions through DigiVol.

===Language revival===
In recent decades, there have been attempts to revive indigenous languages. Significant challenges exist, however, for the revival of languages in the dominant English language culture of Australia.

The Kaurna language, spoken by the Kaurna people of the Adelaide plains, has been the subject of a concerted revival movement since the 1980s, coordinated by Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi, a unit working out of the University of Adelaide. The language had rapidly disappeared after the settlement of South Australia and the breaking up of local indigenous people. Ivaritji, the last known speaker of the language, died in 1931. However, a substantial number of primary source records existed for the language, from which the language was reconstructed.

==Common features==
&quot;Some Aboriginal people distinguish between &quot;usership&quot; and &quot;ownership&quot;. There are even those who claim that they own a language although they only know one single word of it: its name.&quot;

Whether it is due to genetic unity or some other factor such as occasional contact, typologically the Australian languages form a language area or &quot;Sprachbund&quot;, sharing much of their vocabulary and many distinctive phonological features across the entire continent.

A common feature of many Australian languages is that they display so-called avoidance speech, special speech registers used only in the presence of certain close relatives. These registers share the phonology and grammar of the standard language, but the lexicon is different and usually very restricted. There are also commonly speech taboos during extended periods of mourning or initiation that have led to numerous Aboriginal sign languages.

For morphosyntactic alignment, many Australian languages have ergative–absolutive case systems. These are typically split systems; a widespread pattern is for pronouns (or first and second persons) to have nominative–accusative case marking and for third person to be ergative–absolutive, though splits between animate and inanimate are also found. In some languages the persons in between the accusative and ergative inflections (such as second person, or third-person human) may be tripartite: that is, marked overtly as either ergative or accusative in transitive clauses, but not marked as either in intransitive clauses. There are also a few languages which employ only nominative–accusative case marking. 

===Phonetics and phonology===
The following represents a canonical 6-place Australian Aboriginal consonant system. It does not represent any single language, but is instead a simplified form of the consonant inventory of what would be found in many Australian languages, including most Arandic and Yolŋu languages. 
====Segmental inventory====
A typical Australian phonological inventory includes just three vowels, usually , which may occur in both long and short variants. In a few cases the has been unrounded to give .

There is almost never a voicing contrast; that is, a consonant may sound like a at the beginning of a word, but like a between vowels, and either letter could be (and often is) chosen to represent it. Australia also stands out as being almost entirely free of fricative consonants, even of the otherwise universal . In the few cases where fricatives do occur, they developed recently through the lenition (weakening) of stops, and are therefore non-sibilants like rather than the sibilants like that are common elsewhere in the world. Some languages also have three rhotics, typically a flap, a trill, and an approximant (that is, like the combined rhotics of English and Spanish) and many have four laterals.

Besides the lack of fricatives, the most striking feature of Australian speech sounds is the large number of places of articulation. Some 10-15% of Australian languages have four places of articulation, with two coronal places of articulation, 40-50% have five places, and 40-45% have six places of articulation, including four coronals. The four-way distinction in the coronal region is commonly accomplished through two variables: the position of the tongue (front, alveolar or dental, or retroflex), and its shape (apical or laminal).
There are also bilabial, velar and often palatal consonants, but a complete absence of uvular consonants and only a few languages with a glottal stop. Both stops and nasals occur at all six places, and in many languages laterals occur at all four coronal places.

A language which displays the full range of stops, nasals and laterals is Kalkatungu, which has labial &quot;p, m&quot;; &quot;dental&quot; &quot;th, nh, lh&quot;; &quot;alveolar&quot; &quot;t, n, l&quot;; &quot;retroflex&quot; &quot;rt, rn, rl&quot;; &quot;palatal&quot; &quot;ty, ny, ly&quot;; and velar &quot;k, ng&quot;. Wangganguru has all this, as well as three rhotics. Yanyuwa has even more contrasts, with an additional true dorso-palatal series, plus prenasalised consonants at all &quot;seven&quot; places of articulation, in addition to all four laterals.

A notable exception to the above generalisations is Kalaw Lagaw Ya, spoken in the Torres Strait Islands, which has an inventory more like its Papuan neighbours than the languages of the Australian mainland, including full voice contrasts: , dental , alveolar , the sibilants (which have allophonic variation with and respectively) and velar , as well as only one rhotic, one lateral and three nasals (labial, dental and velar) in contrast to the 5 places of articulation of stops/sibilants. Where vowels are concerned, it has 8 vowels with some morpho-syntactic as well as phonemic length contrasts (, , , , , , , ), and glides that distinguish between those that are in origin vowels, and those that in origin are consonants. Kunjen and other neighbouring languages have also developed contrasting aspirated consonants (, , , , ) not found further south.

====Coronal consonants====
Descriptions of the coronal articulations can be inconsistent.

The alveolar series &quot;t, n, l&quot; (or &quot;d, n, l&quot;) is straightforward: across the continent, these sounds are alveolar (that is, pronounced by touching the tongue to the ridge just behind the gum line of the upper teeth) and apical (that is, touching that ridge with the tip of the tongue). This is very similar to English &quot;t, d, n, l&quot;, though the Australian &quot;t&quot; is not aspirated, even in Kalaw Lagaw Ya, despite its other stops being aspirated.

The other apical series is the retroflex, &quot;rt, rn, rl&quot; (or &quot;rd, rn, rl&quot;). Here the place is further back in the mouth, in the postalveolar or prepalatal region. The articulation is actually most commonly subapical; that is, the tongue curls back so that the &quot;underside&quot; of the tip makes contact. That is, they are true retroflex consonants. It has been suggested that subapical pronunciation is characteristic of more careful speech, while these sounds tend to be apical in rapid speech. Kalaw Lagaw Ya and many other languages in North Queensland differ from most other Australian languages in not having a retroflexive series.

The dental series &quot;th, nh, lh&quot; are always laminal (that is, pronounced by touching with the surface of the tongue just above the tip, called the &quot;blade&quot; of the tongue), but may be formed in one of three different ways, depending on the language, on the speaker, and on how carefully the speaker pronounces the sound. These are interdental with the tip of the tongue visible between the teeth, as in &quot;th&quot; in English; dental with the tip of the tongue down behind the lower teeth, so that the blade is visible between the teeth; and denti-alveolar, that is, with both the tip and the blade making contact with the back of the upper teeth and alveolar ridge, as in French &quot;t, d, n, l&quot;. The first tends to be used in careful enunciation, and the last in more rapid speech, while the tongue-down articulation is less common.

Finally, the palatal series &quot;ty, ny, ly&quot;. (The stop is often spelled &quot;dj&quot;, &quot;tj&quot;, or &quot;j&quot;.) Here the contact is also laminal, but further back, spanning the alveolar to postalveolar, or the postalveolar to prepalatal regions. The tip of the tongue is typically down behind the lower teeth. This is similar to the &quot;closed&quot; articulation of Circassian fricatives (see Postalveolar consonant). The body of the tongue is raised towards the palate. This is similar to the &quot;domed&quot; English postalveolar fricative &quot;sh&quot;. Because the tongue is &quot;peeled&quot; from the roof of the mouth from back to front during the release of these stops, there is a fair amount of frication, giving the &quot;ty&quot; something of the impression of the English palato-alveolar affricate &quot;ch&quot; or the Polish alveolo-palatal affricate &quot;ć&quot;. That is, these consonants are not palatal in the IPA sense of the term, and indeed they contrast with true palatals in Yanyuwa. In Kalaw Lagaw Ya, the palatal consonants are sub-phonemes of the alveolar sibilants and .

These descriptions do not apply exactly to all Australian languages, as the notes regarding Kalaw Lagaw Ya demonstrate. However, they do describe most of them, and are the expected norm against which languages are compared.

====Phonotactics====
Some have suggested that the most appropriate unit to describe the phonotactics of Australian languages is the phonological word. The most common word length is two syllables, and a typical phonological word would have the form:

(C)VC(C)V(C)

with the first syllable being stressed. The optionality of C is cross-linguistically normal, since coda consonants are weak or nonexistent in many languages, as well as in the early stages of language acquisition. The weakening of C, on the other hand, is very unusual. No Australian language has consonant clusters in this position, and those languages with fortis and lenis distinctions do not make such distinctions in this position. Place of articulation distinctions are also less common in this position, and lenitions and deletions are historically common here. While in most languages the word-initial position is prominent, maintaining all a language&#x27;s contrasts, that is not the case in Australia. Here the prominent position is C(C), in the middle of the word. C is typically the only position allowing all of a language&#x27;s place of articulation contrasts. Fortis/lenis contrasts can only occur at C, or at C when C is a sonorant. Consonant clusters are often restricted to the C(C) position, and are most commonly sonorant + obstruent sequences. In languages with pre-stopped nasals or laterals, those sounds only occur at C.

Australian languages typically resist certain connected speech processes which might blur the place of articulation of consonants at C(C), such as anticipatory assimilation of place of articulation, which is common around the world. In Australia, this type of assimilation seems only to have affected consonants within the apical and laminal categories. There&#x27;s little evidence of assimilation between the labial, apical, laminal, and dorsal categories. Many proto-Pama–Nyungan and clusters have been preserved across Australia. Heterorganic nasal + stop sequences remain stable even in modern connected speech, which is highly unusual.

The anticipatory assimilation of nasality is quite common in various languages around the world. Typically, a vowel will become nasalized before a following nasal consonant. However, this process is resisted in Australian languages.
There was a historical process in many languages where nasal + stop CC clusters lost the nasal element if C was a nasal. Also, many languages have morphophonemic alterations whereby initial nasals in suffixes are denasalized if the preceding stem contains a nasal consonant.
While the existence of phonemic pre-stopped nasals and laterals, contrasting with plain nasals and laterals, has been documented in some Australian languages, nasals and laterals are pre-stopped on a phonetic level in most languages of the continent. These phenomena are the result of a general resistance to the anticipatory assimilation of nasality and laterality. The lack of assimilation makes coda nasals and laterals more acoustically distinct.

Most speakers of Australian languages speak with a &#x27;pressed&#x27; voice quality, with the glottal opening narrower than in modal voice, a relatively high frequency of creaky voice, and low airflow. This may be due to an avoidance of breathy voice. This pressed quality could therefore serve to enhance the clarity of speech and ensure the perception of place of articulation distinctions.

==Orthography==

Probably every Australian language with speakers remaining has had an orthography developed for it, in each case in the Latin script. Sounds not found in English are usually represented by digraphs, or more rarely by diacritics, such as underlines, or extra symbols, sometimes borrowed from the International Phonetic Alphabet. Some examples are shown in the following table.

==Demographics (2016)==
In the Northern Territory, 62.5% of Aboriginal Australians spoke an indigenous language at home in 2016. In Queensland, almost 95% of Torres Strait Islanders spoke an indigenous language at home in 2016.

<doc id="345156" wikidata="Q156487" url="?curid=345156" title="Péter Medgyessy">
<text>Péter Medgyessy (; born 19 October 1942) is a retired Hungarian politician who served as Prime Minister of Hungary from 27 May 2002 to 29 September 2004. On 25 August 2004, he resigned over disputes with coalition partner Alliance of Free Democrats, but remained as acting prime minister for a 30-day period as required by the Constitution, and a few additional days until his successor Ferenc Gyurcsány was confirmed by the National Assembly.

==Family and studies==
Medgyessy was born into an old Transylvanian noble family in Budapest on 19 October 1942. An ancestor of the family, Miklós Medgyessy de Medgyes, worked as a penman for Prince Gabriel Bethlen in the 17th century. Medgyessy&#x27;s father, Béla Medgyessy, was a recorder in the General Assembly of Cluj until the Second Vienna Award, when Hungary reassigned the territory of Northern Transylvania from the Kingdom of Romania. The family moved to Budapest, where Béla worked for the Ministry of Domestic Trade. Medgyessy&#x27;s mother Ibolya Szolga was an interpreter.

Medgyessy studied theoretical economics at the Corvinus University of Budapest (then called Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences). He graduated in 1966, and returned to receive his doctorate. He is fluent in French and Romanian, and knowledgeable in the English and Russian languages.

He is married to Katalin Csaplár, and has a daughter and son born in 1969 and 1970, respectively, from a previous marriage. His adopted child is Anita Tornóczky, a well-known anchorwoman in Hungary.

==Political career==
===Early career===
Between 1966 and 1982, he held various senior positions in departments of the Ministry of Finance. In 1982, he became Deputy Minister of Finance, and in 1987, he became Minister of Finance in György Lázár&#x27;s cabinet, and held the position in the Károly Grósz administration. As minister, Medgyessy had a significant role in the preparation of a two-tier banking system and banking reform. He was replaced by Miklós Villányi on 16 December 1987.

Between 1987 and 1990, Medgyessy was Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs in the Grósz and Miklós Németh cabinets. He brought the law of new capitalist-style tax system to the National Assembly of Hungary. Besides the ministerial position, Medgyessy was also elected a member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. After the dissolution of the ruling communist state party in October 1989, he did not join the newly-founded successor organization, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP).

After the end of communism in Hungary, Medgyessy briefly retired from politics. From 1990 to 1996, he was CEO and chairman of various Hungarian banks, including Paribas Bank Inc. and Hungarian Investment and Development Bank. After Gyula Horn took over the Hungarian government in 1994, Medgyessy was appointed head of the premier&#x27;s Advisory Board before returning to his previous position as minister of finance, in March 1996, when he replaced Lajos Bokros, who resigned after the controversial Bokros package. After his term ended, he became the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Inter-Europa Bank, and vice president of Atlasz Insurance Company from 1998 to 2001. He also taught at College of Finance and Accountancy (now Budapest Business School) for 15 years beside bank official positions. He served as president of the Hungarian Economic Association.

He received the Commander&#x27;s Cross with a Star of the Order of Merit in 1998, and the highest French decoration, the Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 2000.

===Prime Minister of Hungary===

The MSZP nominated him as their non-partisan candidate for prime minister during the seventh congress of the party in June 2001, after Németh and MP Sándor Nagy had withdrawn from nomination. The party won the 2002 elections against Fidesz and incumbent Prime Minister Viktor Orbán by a small majority, and on 27 May 2002, the Hungarian Parliament elected Medgyessy as the new Prime Minister of Hungary.

&quot;Magyar Nemzet&quot;, a newspaper affiliated with Fidesz, revealed in June 2002 that Medgyessy had been acting as a counterespionage officer under the code name D-209 in the III./II. section of the then-Ministry for Internal Affairs prior to 1989. He admitted to being a secret agent, saying that in the line of duty, he strived to secure Hungary&#x27;s membership in the International Monetary Fund, which the Soviet Union was opposed to. Under the circumstances, this sparked controversy all over the country. At first, leaders of the coalition partner Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) had expressed their support for Medgyessy&#x27;s dismissal as Prime Minister, but the Socialists persuaded them to let Medgyessy stay in office. In response, János Kis, the founding president of SZDSZ, left the party in July 2002, referring to the SZDSZ&#x27;s decision as being in conflict with his moral values. In the aftermath of these events, demonstrators blocked traffic across the Elisabeth Bridge and demanded that a new tally of the parliamentary election results be conducted.

One of the main campaign promises of MSZP was &quot;The Welfare System Change&quot;. To implement it, the Medgyessy government announced a 100-day action program that provided a 50% increase of wage to public employees and a one-time HUF 19,000 allowance to pensioners. Academic scholarships and pensions that had not reached the amount of the minimum wage were also increased. These measures cost HUF 190 billion on the exchange rate. Fidesz and MDF MPs also voted in favour of the bill. At this time, Medgyessy&#x27;s approval rating was the highest, and the government consequently adopted a second 100-day program afterwards. According to later critics, the two programs caused an excess spending of HUF 817 billion in the state budget, while, according to a 2009 report from the State Audit Office, the total annual cost of the housing subsidies rose from roughly HUF 50 billion (EUR 184.14 million) a year in 2000 to HUF 255 billion (EUR 939.14 million) in 2005.

Under Medgyessy&#x27;s prime ministership, a referendum was held on 12 April 2003 to decide if Hungary should join the European Union. All of the major political parties in Hungary, the trade unions, business organisations, churches and media were in favour of Hungary&#x27;s membership of the EU.

In early 2004, Medgyessy proposed a joint electoral list with the participation of all parliamentary parties for the European Parliament election. His idea was rejected by SZDSZ and all opposition parties, but during a meeting of leaders of the four parliamentary groups, all parties agreed to a &quot;national minimum&quot;, which included partnerships and contacts in the European organizations. The European Parliament also called Medgyessy&#x27;s proposal &quot;anti-democratic&quot; in March 2004. In the July 2004 elections, the Hungarian Socialist Party was heavily defeated by Fidesz. Afterwards, Medgyessy gradually lost support of the MSZP-SZDSZ alliance. Word got around MSZP that the party could not win another parliamentary election with him against Viktor Orbán, meanwhile Ferenc Gyurcsány who then was a minister responsible for sports, youth and children in his government, came forward as a potential candidate for prime minister.

Before his resignation, he had fallen out with the SZDSZ, accused them of being involved in corruption cases, and was about to relieve SZDSZ delegate Minister of Economy István Csillag from duty. In response, SZDSZ withdrew its support for him, after which he declared his resignation to prevent a parliamentary motion of no confidence. The MSZP accepted his resignation, which took effect on 25 August, and in accordance with the Hungarian Constitution he became &quot;acting Prime Minister&quot; for the next 30 days. In the meantime his successor, Ferenc Gyurcsány, acted on his behalf. Medgyessy stepped down as prime minister in August 2004 and was succeeded by Gyurcsány.

==Controversies==
Medgyessy was ridiculed by certain segments of the Budapest press because of his allegedly weak rhetorical abilities; a book titled &quot;Medgyessyizmusok&quot; (&quot;Medgyessyism&quot;, in analogy to &quot;Bushism&quot;) appeared in 2004.

In response to Hungarian exporters&#x27; interests, he decided to decrease the central value of the floating exchange rate range of the forint. Investors considered his decision to be incomprehensible and a flawed piece of economic policy, causing them to sell forints and Hungarian government bonds, which led to significant interest rate hikes by the National Bank of Hungary.

Fulfilling the promise of the &quot;change of welfare regime&quot;, the slogan of his campaign in the 2002 elections, the Medgyessy government increased the wages of civil servants by 50%, and increased allowances for university students and pensioners. Pensioners also received a one-time pension supplement. Economists criticised this move, calling it an irresponsible drain on the budget that amounted to nearly 190 billion forints, and hypothesised it was done purely to increase the administration&#x27;s popularity.

During Medgyessy&#x27;s prime ministership, political attacks were launched against some independent senior civil servants who had been appointed by the Orbán cabinet. Court rulings subsequently established that the head of the Hungarian Energy Office and the chairman of the Hungarian Statistical Office were removed from their positions unconstitutionally and illegally. The chief of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority was removed without legal challenge, though without any material basis related to his performance in office.

Medgyessy was also a co-signatory of the letter of the eight, which supported the U.S. position on Iraq.

==Life since government==
After his resignation, he continued to serve as a Member of Parliament as a travelling ambassador &quot;to make sure Hungary can become a successful member of the most important international alliances including the European Union&quot;. He did not run as MP in the 2006 parliamentary election. He was called back by Gyurcsány in mid-2008 after he openly criticized the government in some of his interviews.

Medgyessy was interviewed by Index on the tenth anniversary of his resignation on 27 August 2014, where he called Gyurcsány a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; and &quot;traitor&quot;. According to Medgyessy, he was removed from the position of Prime Minister after a secret agreement between MSZP and SZDSZ leaders László Kovács, Ildikó Lendvai, Katalin Szili and Gábor Kuncze. He also said he would enact the 100-day action program again, but he regretted not revealing his D-209 agency past before the 2002 elections.

==Awards and merits==
He received the Commander&#x27;s Cross with a Star of the Hungarian Order of Merit in 1998, and the highest French decoration, the Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 2000. In 2002 he received the Grand Cross of the Belgian Order of the Crown and the Gold and Silver Star of the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun, and in 2003, the Grand Cross of the Order of the Merit of Chile and the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. In 2004 he became a Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour and received the German Federal Cross of Merit.

<text>Okha () is a town and the administrative center of Okhinsky District of Sakhalin Oblast, Russia. Population: 

==Geography==
Okha is located on the east coast of the far north of Sakhalin island, just south of the isthmus of the Schmidt Peninsula, approximately north of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, near the shoreline of the Sea of Okhotsk.

==History==
It was founded shortly after the discovery of petroleum in the area in 1880, initially under the name &quot;Okhe&quot;. The name is derived from an Ainu word meaning &quot;Bad Water&quot;. Industrial exploitation of the petroleum reserves began in 1923, during the Japanese occupation of Sakhalin from 1920 to 1925. During this time the town was called or depending on Kanji used. Town status was granted to it in 1938.

==Climate==
The town suffered significant damage in the 1995 Neftegorsk earthquake that occurred on May 28, and was used as pivotal base for rescuers deployed to Neftegorsk, which was destroyed to the extent that it was not rebuilt. A number of survivors of Neftegorsk were later transferred to Okha. Another smaller earthquake hit the town on May 10, 2005, but there were no fatalities or significant damage.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Okha serves as the administrative center of Okhinsky District and is subordinated to it. As a municipal division, the town of Okha and ten rural localities of Okhinsky District are incorporated as Okhinsky Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
Okha, along with the oblast&#x27;s administrative center Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, is the center of Sakhalin&#x27;s petroleum industry. An oil pipeline and gas main runs from Okha to Komsomolsk-on-Amur on the Russian mainland. A number of oil wells exist in close proximity to the town, mainly controlled by the company Rosneft.

In 1920, during the Siberian Intervention, Japan occupied the northern part of Sakhalin Island, returning it to the Soviet Union in 1925 after the Treaty of Beijing was signed on January 20, 1925. However, Japan formed the state owned firm North Sakhalin Oil () which extracted oil from the OKHA Oil Field () near Okha on North Sakhalin from 1926 to 1944.

===Transportation===
The town is the northern end point for the island&#x27;s road system. There was a rail connection to the island&#x27;s narrow-gauge rail network at Nogliki; however, this was closed in 2006.

There is an airport in Okha with service to Khabarovsk and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.

<doc id="345173" wikidata="Q54158" url="?curid=345173" title="Łódź Voivodeship">
<text>Łódź Voivodeship ( ) is a voivodeship (province) of Poland. The province is named after its capital and largest city, Łódź, pronounced .

Łódź Voivodeship is bordered by six other voivodeships: Masovian to the north and east, Świętokrzyskie to the south-east, Silesian to the south, Opole to the south-west, Greater Poland to the west, and Kuyavian-Pomeranian for a short stretch to the north. Its territory belongs to three historical provinces of Poland – Masovia (in the east), Greater Poland (in the west) and Lesser Poland (in the southeast, around Opoczno).

== Cities and towns ==


The voivodeship contains 11 cities and 35 towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (according to official figures for 31 December 2021):
== Administrative division ==
Łódź Voivodeship is divided into 24 counties (powiats): 3 city counties and 21 land counties. These are further divided into 177 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordered within categories by descending population).

==Protected areas==

Protected areas in Łódź Voivodeship include seven Landscape Parks, as listed below.
*Bolimów Landscape Park (partly in Masovian Voivodeship)
*Łódź Hills Landscape Park
*Przedbórz Landscape Park (partly in Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship)
*Spała Landscape Park
*Sulejów Landscape Park
*Warta-Widawka Landscape Park
*Załęcze Landscape Park (partly in Silesian Voivodeship)

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 26.7 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 6.0% of Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 19,800 euros or 66% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was also 66% of the EU average.

==History==

The territory formed part of Poland since its establishment in the 10th century. Oldest medieval towns in the region include Biała Rawska, Brzeziny, Inowłódz, Łęczyca, Łowicz, Pajęczno, Radomsko, Rozprza, Sieradz, Wolbórz and Żarnów. Łęczyca, Rawa Mazowiecka, Sieradz and Wieluń became medieval ducal seats of the Piast dynasty. The current Łódź Voivodeship is roughly coextensive with the historic Łęczyca Land and Sieradz Land combined, and thus the Łęczyca and Sieradz voivodeships of the former Kingdom of Poland, although it also contains portions of Mazovia (in the north-east) and Lesser Poland (in the south-east). Piotrków Trybunalski, currently the second-largest city of the province, hosted many sessions of the Polish Parliament, the last in 1567, and was the seat of the Crown Tribunal for the Greater Poland Province, the highest appeal court in the Kingdom of Poland. The towns of Ozorków, Aleksandrów Łódzki, Zduńska Wola, Stryków, Konstantynów Łódzki, Zgierz, Tomaszów Mazowiecki, Łódź and Pabianice greatly developed during the Industrial Revolution after textile manufactures were founded there between 1807 and 1823, with Łódź eventually surpassing other towns in the region. Bolimów was the site of the Battle of Bolimów (31 January 1915) during World War I where gas weapons were used for the first time, when the German Army shelled Russian troops with xylyl bromide.
The capital of the Łódź Voivodeship has always been Łódź, but the area of land which it comprises has changed several times. The first was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Second Polish Republic in the years 1921–1939. In 1938 some western counties were ceded to Greater Poland Voivodeship (see: Territorial changes of Polish Voivodeships on 1 April 1938).

After the change, Łódź Voivodeship&#x27;s area was , and its population (as for 1931) was 2,650,100. It consisted of 15 powiats (counties):
* Brzeziny county,
* Końskie county,
* Kutno county,
* Łask county,
* Łęczyca county,
* Łowicz county,
* city of Łódź county (powiat łódzki grodzki),
* Łódź county,
* Opoczno county,
* Piotrków Trybunalski county,
* Radomsko county,
* Rawa Mazowiecka county,
* Sieradz county,
* Skierniewice county,
* Wieluń county.

The largest cities of the voivodeship were (population according to the 1931 census):
* Łódź (pop. 604,600),
* Piotrków Trybunalski (pop. 51,300),
* Pabianice (pop. 45,700),
* Tomaszów Mazowiecki (pop. 38,000),
* Zgierz (pop. 26,600),
* Kutno (pop. 23,400),
* Radomsko (pop. 23,000).

Source: Mały rocznik statystyczny 1939, Nakładem Glownego Urzędu Statystycznego, Warszawa 1939 (Concise Statistical Year-Book of Poland, Warsaw 1939).

Wieluń was the site of the Bombing of Wieluń conducted by Germany on 1 September 1939, considered the first major bombing of World War II. During the war, the territory was occupied by Germany, with the occupiers committing their genocidal policies against Poles and Jews in the region, with expulsions, kidnapping of children, massacres of civilians and prisoners of war. Germany operated numerous prisons, including the particularly notorious in Łódź and Sieradz, and forced labour camps. The Łódź Ghetto, the second-largest Jewish ghetto in all of German-occupied Europe, was located in Łódź. Warta was the location of &quot;Aktion T4&quot; murders of over 500 mentally ill people.

The next incarnation existed from 1945 until 1975 (although the city of Łódź was excluded as a separate City Voivodeship). This Łódź Voivodeship was then broken up, superseded by Łódź (see below), Sieradz, Piotrków Trybunalski, Skierniewice and partly Płock Voivodeships.
Łódź Voivodeship, also known as Łódź Metropolitan Voivodeship (&quot;województwo miejskie łódzkie&quot;), existed from 1975 until 1998, after which it was incorporated into today&#x27;s Łódź Voivodeship. Until 1990, the mayor of the city of Łódź was also the voivodeship governor.

As of 1995, major cities and towns in Łódź Metropolitan Voivodeship included (with their 1995 populations):
* Łódź (825,600);
* Pabianice (75,700);
* Zgierz (59,100);
* Ozorków (21,900);
* Aleksandrów Łódzki (20,400).

The current Łódź Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Łódź Voivodeship (1975–1999) and the Sieradz, Piotrków Trybunalski and Skierniewice Voivodeships and part of Płock Voivodeship, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. 

==Culture and education==
The basic cultural activities in the Łódź Region are: monitoring activities of seven regional self-government cultural institutions, i.e., the Arthur Rubinstein Łódź Philharmonic, Museum of Art in Łódź (having one of the biggest modern art collections in Europe), the Opera House, Stefan Jaracz Theater, the Museum of Archeology and Ethnography, the Józef Piłsudski Regional and Municipal Public Library in Łódź, the Chamber of Culture in Łódź but also: supporting NGO’s, protection of monuments, awarding scholarships to young artists and rewards for the prominent artists. What is more, infrastructural projects are being undertaken. Among the most important investments are: the creation of four regional scenes in Stefan Jaracz Theatre, opening the new section of the Museum of Art in Łódź - ms² or the reconstruction of medieval settlement in Tum in the vicinity of Łęczyca.

As of 2020, there were 76,897 students in various institutions of higher education in Łódź Voivodeship. The major universities in the voivodeship are:
*University of Łódź
*Lodz University of Technology
*National Film School in Łódź
*Medical University of Łódź
*Higher School of National Economy in Kutno
*Academy of Fine Arts In Łódź
*Jan Kochanowski University in Piotrków Trybunalski

The excellent scientific staff of the higher education establishments in Łódź is complemented by Łódź’s scientists from the Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) and scientific ministerial institutes working within the field of the occupational medicine, textile, paper and leather industries.

==Sights and tourism==
There are five Historic Monuments of Poland in the voivodeship:
*Łowicz Cathedral
*Industrial city landscape of Łódź
*Nieborów Palace and park
*Sulejów Abbey
*Tum Collegiate Church

There are multiple either entirely or partly preserved castles in the province, including in Bąkowa Góra, Besiekiery, Bolesławiec, Drzewica, Inowłódz, Łęczyca, Opoczno, Oporów, Piotrków Trybunalski, Uniejów, and multiple palaces, including in Poddębice, Skierniewice, Sokolniki, Walewice, Wola-Chojnata and several in Łódź alone.

The province&#x27;s sole spa town is Uniejów.

There are numerous World War II memorials, including a museum at the site of the former Nazi German Radogoszcz prison in Łódź, and monuments at the sites of German-perpetrated massacres and camps.

==Sports==

Football and volleyball enjoy the largest following in the province. ŁKS Łódź and Widzew Łódź contest the Łódź Derby, one of the fiercest football rivalries in Poland.
Since the establishment of the province, several international sports competitions were co-hosted by the province, including the EuroBasket 2009, 2009 Women&#x27;s European Volleyball Championship, EuroBasket Women 2011, 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s World Championship, and 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

==Curiosities==
*The Polish language of the inhabitants of the voivodeship is considered the closest to the Polish literary language, as the region did not develop its own dialect, but was a place of blending of dialects from the neighboring larger regions of Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Mazovia and Silesia.
*In the 17th century, the towns of Brzeziny, Sieradz and Warta were home to sizeable Scottish communities.

<doc id="345178" wikidata="Q1602605" url="?curid=345178" title="Hell, Michigan">
<text>Hell is an unincorporated community in Livingston County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Putnam Township along Patterson Lake Road (D-32) about northwest of Ann Arbor and southwest of Pinckney. As an unincorporated community, Hell has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own and is served by the Pinckney 48169 ZIP Code. 

==Geography==
Hell is in Putnam Township, Livingston County, and about south of Howell, the county seat. Based on satellite views, the area is heavily forested, with some fields west and east of town. Hell&#x27;s business district is centered along Patterson Lake Road about northwest of Ann Arbor, about southeast of Lansing, south-southwest of Flint, and west-northwest of Detroit.

==History==
Hell developed around a sawmill, gristmill, distillery and tavern. All four were operated by George Reeves, who moved to the area in the 1830s from the Catskill Mountains in New York. He purchased a sawmill on what is now known as Hell Creek in 1841. In addition to the sawmill, Reeves purchased of land surrounding the mill. Reeves then built a gristmill on Hell Creek which was powered by water that was impounded by a small dam across the creek. Farmers in the area were quite successful in growing wheat and had an abundance of grain. Reeves opened a distillery to process the excess grain into whiskey. Reeves also opened a general store/tavern on his property.

The tavern and distillery soon became a thriving business for Reeves. He built a ballroom on the second floor of the establishment and a sulky racetrack around his millpond. Reeves also sold his alcohol to nearby roadhouses and stores for as little as ten cents a gallon. His operation came under the scrutiny of the U.S. government in the years after the American Civil War. When tax collectors came to Hell to assess his operation, Reeves and his customers conspired to hide the whiskey by filling barrels and sinking them to the bottom of the millpond. When the government agents left the area, the barrels were hauled to the surface with ropes. As Reeves aged, he slowed his business ventures, closing the distillery and witnessing the burning of the gristmill. He died in 1877.

Reeves&#x27; family sold the land to a group of investors from Detroit in 1924. The investors increased the size of the millpond by raising the level of the dam, creating what is now Hiland Lake. The area soon became a summer resort area, attracting visitors for swimming and fishing. Henry Ford considered building some manufacturing facilities in the area but decided against it.

==Etymology==
Hell has been noted on a list of unusual place names. There are a number of theories for the origin of Hell&#x27;s name. The first is that a pair of German travelers stepped out of a stagecoach one sunny afternoon in the 1830s, and one said to the other, &quot;So schön hell!&quot; (translated as, &quot;So beautifully bright!&quot;) Their comments were overheard by some locals and the name stuck. The second theory is tied to the &quot;hell-like&quot; conditions, including mosquitos, thick forest cover, and extensive wetlands, encountered by early explorers. A third theory is that George Reeves’ habit of paying the local farmers for their grain with home distilled whiskey led many wives to comment “He’s gone to Hell again” when questioned about their husband’s whereabouts during harvest time. A fourth is that soon after Michigan gained statehood, Reeves was asked what he thought the town he helped settle should be called and replied &quot;I don&#x27;t care. You can name it Hell for all I care.&quot; The name became official on October 13, 1841.

==Arts and culture==
In the early 1930s, Pinckney, Michigan, postmaster W. C. Miller began to receive requests from stamp and postmark collectors for cancellations: Hell had no post office, instead being served by the one for Pinckney, three miles away. On July 15, 1961, a postal substation was established at Hell, operating from May 1 through September 30. It remains at the back of the general store, although the United States Postal Service does not recognize Hell as a town; it instead uses the name of nearby Pinckney as the mailing address.

In 1963, the Hell Chamber of Commerce sponsored a two-day &quot;fun festival&quot; which began with Satan&#x27;s arrival by helicopter at &quot;Satan&#x27;s Hills&quot;, a local housing development.

The town occasionally experiences sub-zero temperatures (including in Jan 2014, Jan 2018, and Jan 2019), leading to comparisons with the phrase &quot;when hell freezes over&quot;.

==Education==
The Pinckney Community Schools serve Hell. The schools are Pathfinder Middle School, Farley Hill Elementary and Navigator Elementary.

<doc id="345179" wikidata="Q1265579" url="?curid=345179" title="Exilarch">
<text>The exilarch was the leader of the Jewish community in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) during the era of the Parthians, Sasanians and Abbasid Caliphate up until the Mongol invasion of Baghdad in 1258, with intermittent gaps due to ongoing political developments. The exilarch was regarded by the Jewish community as the royal heir of the House of David and held a place of prominence as both a rabbinical authority and as a noble within the Persian and Arab court.

Within the Sasanian Empire, the exilarch was the political equivalent of the &quot;Catholicos&quot; of the Christian Church of the East and was thus responsible for community-specific organizational tasks such as running the rabbinical courts, collecting taxes from Jewish communities, supervising and providing financing for the Talmudic academies in Babylonia, and the charitable re-distribution and financial assistance to needy members of the exile community. The position of exilarch was hereditary, held in continuity by a family that traced its patrilineal descent from antiquity stemming from king David.

The first historical documents referring to it date from the time when Babylonia was part of the late Parthian Empire. The office first appears during the 2nd century and continues to the middle of the 6th century, under different Persian dynasties (the Parthians and Sassanids). In the late 5th and early 6th centuries, Mar-Zutra II briefly formed a politically independent state where he ruled from Mahoza for about seven years. He was eventually defeated by Kavadh I, King of Persia, and the office of the exilarch was diminished for some time thereafter. The position was restored to prominence in the 7th century, under the rule of the Arab Caliphate, and the office of exilarch continued to be appointed by Arab authorities through the 11th century.

The exilarch&#x27;s authority came under considerable challenge in 825 during the reign of al-Ma&#x27;mun who issued a decree permitting a group of ten men from any religious community to organize separately, which allowed the Gaon of the Talmudic academies of Sura and Pumbedita to compete with the exilarch for power and influence, later contributing to the wider schism between Karaites and Rabbinic Jewry.

==Title==

The word &quot;exilarch&quot; is a Greco-Latin calque of the Hebrew (), literally meaning &#x27;head of the exile&#x27;. The position was similarly called in Aramaic ( or ) and Arabic ( . It was translated into Persian as . The Jewish people in exile were referred to as (, ) or (). The contemporary Greek term that was used was (), literally meaning the &#x27;leader of the captives&#x27;. This Greek term has continued to be applied to the office, notwithstanding changes to the position over time, which were largely titular.

==Development and organization==

Although there is no mention of the office before the 2nd century, the &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot; alleges that the office of exilarch was established following the deportation of King Jeconiah and his court into exile in Babylon after the first fall of Jerusalem in 597 BCE and augmented after the further deportations following the destruction of the kingdom of Judah in 587. The history of the Babylonian exilarchate falls into two separate identifiable periods: before and after the beginning of the Arabic rule of Babylonia. Nothing is known about the office before the 2nd century, when it is first referenced in the Talmud, including any details about its origins. It can merely be said in general that the &quot;golah&quot; (&quot;diaspora&quot;), the Jews living in compact masses in various parts of Babylon, tended gradually to unite and create an organization, and that this tendency, together with the high regard in which the descendants of the house of David living in Babylon were held, brought it about that a member of this house was recognized as &quot;head of the &quot;golah&quot;.&quot; The dignity became hereditary in this house and was finally recognized by the state, and hence became an established political institution, first of the Arsacid Empire and then the Sassanid.

Such was the exilarchate as it appears in Talmudic literature, the chief source for its history during the first period, and which provides our only information regarding the rights and functions of the exilarchate. For the second, Arabic period, there is a very important and trustworthy description of the institution of the exilarchate (&quot;See the sections Installation ceremonies and Income and privileges&quot;). This description is also important for the first period as many of the details may be regarded as having persisted from it.

In Baghdad, the privilege of using seals was limited to the exilarch and &quot;geonim&quot;. Serving under the authority of the caliph, they were extremely powerful as the highest authority for the Jewish people in the Caliphate. The use of seals was not limited to internal matters; their authority was recognized by Muslims as well. Based on the account of Benjamin of Tudela: 
&quot;At the head of them all [the Jews under the Baghdad caliphate] is Daniel the son of Hisdai, who is styled &#x27;Our Lord the Head of the Captivity of all Israel.&#x27; ... he has been invested with authority over all the congregations of Israel at the hands of the Emir al Muminim, the Lord of Islam.&quot;

==History==

===Legendary origins===
The &quot;Seder Olam Zuta&quot; states that the first exilarch was Jehoiachin, the king of Judah who was carried off to captivity in Babylonia in 597 BCE, wherein he established his residence at the city of Nehardea in Babylonia. This chronicle, written 800, presents a legendary origin to the early history of the house of the Babylonian exilarch. The captive king&#x27;s advancement at Evil-Merodach&#x27;s court—with which the narrative of the Second Book of Kings closes ()—was regarded by the author of the &quot;Seder &#x27;Olam Zuta&quot; as the origin of the office, and the basis for the exilarch&#x27;s authority. A list of generations of the descendants of the king is given in the text, which closely parallels the names found in I Chronicles 3:17 &quot;et seq.&quot;

A commentary to the Chronicles dating from the school of Saadia Gaon quotes Judah ibn Kuraish to the effect that the genealogical list of the descendants of David was added to the book at the end of the period of the Second Temple, a view which was shared by the author of the list of Babylonian exilarchs in Seder &#x27;Olam Zuta. This list attempts to bridge the 700-year gap between Jehoiachin and the first exilarch mentioned in written sources, Nahum. It grants some specific hallmarks chronologically connecting personalities with the history of the Second Temple, such as Shechaniah, who is mentioned as having lived at the time of the Temple&#x27;s destruction. The following are enumerated as his predecessors in office: Salathiel, Zerubbabel, Meshullam, Hananiah, Berechiah, Hasadiah, Jesaiah, Obadiah, and Shemaiah, Shecaniah, and Hezekiah. All of these names are also found in I Chron. 3., albeit in a confabulated order. This list cannot be historical given the limited number of generations presented. The name Akkub is also found at the end of the Davidic list in the Seder Olam Zuta, which is followed by Nahum, with whom the historic portion of the list begins, and who may be roughly assigned to the time of the destruction of Jerusalem (135). This is the period in which the first allusions in rabbinical literature are found to the office of the exilarch.

===First allusions in the Jerusalem Talmud===
In the account referring to the attempt of a teacher of the Law from the land of Israel, Hananiah, nephew of Joshua ben Hananiah, to render the Babylonian Jews independent of the Sanhedrin, the religious and political authority residing in the land of Judea, a man named &#x27;Ahijah&#x27; is mentioned as the temporal head of the Babylonian Jews, possibly, one of the first historic exilarchs. Another rabbinical source substitutes the name &quot;Nehunyon&quot; for &quot;Ahijah&quot;. It is likely that this &#x27;Nehunyon&#x27; is identical with the Nahum mentioned in the list. The political danger threatening the Sanhedrin eventually passed. At about this same time, Rabbi Nathan, a member of the house of exilarch, came to Galilee, where the Sanhedrin met and where the Nasi resided following the Jewish expulsion from Jerusalem. By virtue of his rabbinical scholarship, he was soon classed among the foremost tannaim of the post-Hadrianic epoch. His supposed Davidic genealogical origins suggested to Rabbi Meïr the plan of making the Babylonian scholar &quot;nasi&quot; (prince) in place of the Hillelite Simon ben Gamaliel. However, the conspiracy against the reigning Nasi failed. Rabbi Nathan was subsequently among the confidants of the Hillelite patriarchal house and the teacher of Simon ben Gamaliel&#x27;s son, Judah I (also known as Judah haNasi).

Rabbi Meïr&#x27;s attempt, however, seems to have led Judah I to fear that the Babylonian exilarch might come to Judea to claim the office from Hillel the Elder&#x27;s descendant. He discussed the subject with the Babylonian scholar Hiyya, a prominent member of his school, saying that he would pay due honor to the exilarch should the latter come but that he would not renounce the office of &quot;nasi&quot; in his favor. When the body of the exilarch Huna, who was the first incumbent of that office explicitly mentioned as such in Talmudic literature, was brought to Judea during the time of Judah I, Hiyya drew upon himself Judah&#x27;s deep resentment by announcing the fact to him with the words &quot;Huna is here&quot;. A tannaitic exposition of Genesis 49:10 which contrasts the Babylonian exilarchs, ruling by force, with Hillel&#x27;s descendants, teaching in public, evidently intends to cast a negative reflection on the former. However, Judah I had to listen at his own table to the statement of the youthful sons of the Hiyya above about the same tannaitic exposition, that &quot;the Messiah can not appear until the exilarchate at Babylon and the patriarchate at Jerusalem shall have ceased&quot;.

===Succession of exilarchs===

According to the &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot; Nahum was followed by his brother Johanan, both of whom are called sons of Akkub in the text. Johanan&#x27;s son Shaphat is listed next, who was succeeded by Anan, his son. Given the chronological similarities, the identification of the exilarch Anan with the Huna of the Talmud account is very likely. At the time of Anan&#x27;s successor Nathan Ukban I, according to the Seder Olam Zuta, occurred the fall of the Parthian Empire and the founding of the Sassanid dynasty in CE 226, which is noted as follows in &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot;: &quot;In the year 166 after the destruction of the Temple (c. CE 234) the Persian Empire advanced upon the Romans&quot; (on the historical value of this statement. Nathan &#x27;Ukban, also known as Mar &#x27;Ukban, was the contemporary of Rav and Samuel, who also occupied a prominent position among the scholars of Babylon&#x27; and, according to Sherira Gaon, was also exilarch. As &#x27;Ukban&#x27;s successor is mentioned in the list his son (Huna II), whose chief advisers were Rav (died 247) and Samuel (died 254), and in whose time Papa ben Nazor destroyed Nehardea. Huna&#x27;s son and successor, Nathan, whose chief advisers were Judah ben Ezekiel (died 299) and Shesheth, was called, like his grandfather, &quot;Mar &#x27;Ukban&quot;, and it is he, the second exilarch of this name, whose curious correspondence with Eleazar ben Pedat is referred to in the Talmud. He was succeeded by his brother (not his son, as stated in &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot;); his leading adviser was Shezbi. The &quot;exilarch Nehemiah&quot; is also mentioned in the Talmud; he is the same person as &quot;Rabbanu Nehemiah,&quot; and he and his brother &quot;Rabbeinu &#x27;Ukban&quot; (Mar Ukban II) are several times mentioned in the Talmud as sons of Rav&#x27;s daughter (hence Huna II was Rav&#x27;s son-in-law) and members of the house of the exilarchs.

===The Mar Ukbans===

According to &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot;, in Nehemiah&#x27;s time, the 245th year after the destruction of the Temple (313 CE), there took place a great religious persecution by the Persians, of which, however, no details are known. Nehemiah was succeeded by his son Mar &#x27;Ukban III, whose chief advisers were Rabbah ben Nahmani (died 323) and Adda. He is mentioned as &quot;&#x27;Ukban ben Nehemiah, resh galuta,&quot; in the Talmud. This Mar &#x27;Ukban, the third exilarch of that name, was also called &quot;Nathan,&quot; as were the first two, and has been made the hero of a legend under the name of &quot;Nathan de-Ẓuẓita&quot;. The conquest of Armenia (337) by Shapur (Sapor) II is mentioned in the chronicle as a historical event occurring during the time of Nathan Ukban III.

He was succeeded by his brother Huna Mar (Huna III), whose chief advisers were Abaye (died 338) and Raba; then followed Mar Ukban&#x27;s son Abba, whose chief advisers were Raba (died 352) and Rabina. During Abba&#x27;s time King Sapor conquered Nisibis. The designation of a certain Isaac as &quot;resh galuta&quot; in the time of Abaye and Raba is due to a clerical error [Brüll&#x27;s &quot;Jahrbuch&quot;, vii. 115], and is therefore omitted from lists. Abba was succeeded first by his son Nathan and then by another son, Kahana I. The latter&#x27;s son Huna is then mentioned as successor, being the fourth exilarch of that name; he died in 441, according to a trustworthy source, the &quot;Seder Tannaim wa-Amoraim.&quot; Hence he was a contemporary of Rav Ashi, the great master of Sura, who died in 427. In the Talmud, however, Huna ben Nathan is mentioned as Ashi&#x27;s contemporary, and according to Sherira it was he who was Mar Kahana&#x27;s successor, a statement which is also confirmed by the Talmud. The statement of &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot; ought perhaps to be emended, since Huna was probably not the son of Mar Kahana, but the son of the latter&#x27;s elder brother Nathan.

===Persecutions under Peroz and Kobad===

Huna was succeeded by his brother Mar Zutra, whose chief adviser was Ahai of Diphti, the same who was defeated in 455 by Ashi&#x27;s son Tabyomi (Mar) at the election for director of the school of Sura. Mar Zutra was succeeded by his son Kahana (Kahana II), whose chief adviser was Rabina, the editor of the Babylonian Talmud (died 499). Then followed two exilarchs by the same name: another son of Mar Zutra, Huna V, and a grandson of Mar Zutra, Huna VI, the son of Kahana.

Huna V fell a victim to the persecutions under King Peroz (Firuz) of Persia, being executed, according to Sherira, in 470; Huna VI was not installed in office until some time later, the exilarchate being vacant during the persecutions under Peroz; he died in 508 [Sherira]. The &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot; connects with the birth of his son Mar Zutra the legend that is elsewhere told in connection with Bostanai&#x27;s birth.

Mar Zutra II, who came into office at the age of fifteen, took advantage of the confusion into which Mazdak&#x27;s communistic attempts had plunged Persia, to obtain by force of arms for a short time a sort of political independence for the Jews of Babylon. King Kobad, however, punished him by crucifying him on the bridge of Mahuza (c. 502). A son was born to him on the day of his death, who was also named &quot;Mar Zutra.&quot; The latter did not attain to the office of exilarch, but went to the land of Israel, where he became head of the Academy of Tiberias, under the title of &quot;Resh Pirka&quot; (&#x27;Aρχιφεκίτησ), several generations of his descendants succeeding him in this office.

After Mar Zutra&#x27;s death the exilarchate of Babylon remained unoccupied for some time. Mar Ahunai lived in the period succeeding Mar Zutra II, but for almost fifty years after the catastrophe he did not dare to appear in public, and it is not known whether even then (c. 550) he really acted as exilarch. At any rate the chain of succession of those who inherited the office was not broken. The names of Kafnai and his son Haninai, who were exilarchs in the second half of the 6th, have been preserved.

Haninai&#x27;s posthumous son Bostanai was the first of the exilarchs under Arabic rule. Bostanai was the ancestor of the exilarchs who were in office from the time when the Persian empire was conquered by the Arabs, in 642, down to the 11th century. Through him, the splendor of the office was renewed and its political position made secure. His tomb in Pumbedita was a place of worship as late as the 12th century, according to Benjamin of Tudela.

Not much is known regarding Bostanai&#x27;s successors down to the time of Saadia except their names; even the name of Bostanai&#x27;s son is not known. The list of the exilarchs down to the end of the 9th century is given as follows in an old document: &quot;Bostanai, Hanina ben Adoi, Hasdai I, Solomon, Isaac Iskawi I, Judah Zakkai (Babawai), Moses, Isaac Iskawi II, David ben Judah, Hasdai II.&quot;

Hasdai I was probably Bostanai&#x27;s grandson. The latter&#x27;s son Solomon had a deciding voice in the appointments to the gaonate of Sura in the years 733 and 759 [Sherira]. Isaac Iskawi I died very soon after Solomon. In the dispute between David&#x27;s sons Anan and Hananiah regarding the succession the latter was victor; Anan then proclaimed himself anti-exilarch, was imprisoned, and founded the etc. of the Karaites. So says the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; of 1906; the origin of the Karaites is not uncontroversial. His descendants were regarded by the Karaites as the true exilarchs. The following list of Karaite exilarchs, father being succeeded always by son, is given in the genealogy of one of these &quot;Karaite princes&quot;: Anan, Saul, Josiah, Boaz, Jehoshaphat, David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Hasdai, Solomon II. Anan&#x27;s brother Hananiah is not mentioned in this list.

Judah Zakkai, who is called &quot;Zakkai ben Ahunai&quot; by Sherira, had as rival candidate Natronai ben Habibai, who, however, was defeated and sent West in banishment; this Natronai was a great scholar, and, according to tradition, while in Spain wrote the Talmud from memory. David ben Judah also had to contend with an anti-exilarch, Daniel by name. The fact that the decision in this dispute rested with the calif Al-Ma&#x27;mun (825) indicates a decline in the power of the exilarchate. David ben Judah, who carried off the victory, appointed Isaac ben Hiyya as Gaon at Pumbedita in 833. Preceding Hasdai II&#x27;s name in the list that of his father Natronai must be inserted. Both are designated as exilarchs in a geonic responsum.

===Deposition of &#x27;Ukba===
Ukban IV is mentioned as exilarch immediately following the death of Hasdai II; he was deposed at the instigation of Kohen-Zedek, Gaon of Pumbedita, but was reinstated in 918 on account of some Arabic verses with which he greeted the caliph al-Muqtadir. He was deposed again soon afterwards, and fled to Kairwan, where he was treated with great honor by the Jewish community there.

&#x27;Ukba&#x27;s nephew, David II, became exilarch; but he had to contend for nearly two years with Kohen-Zedek before he was finally confirmed in his power (921). In consequence of Saadia&#x27;s call to the gaonate of Sura and his controversy with David, the latter has become one of the best-known personages of Jewish history. Saadia had David&#x27;s brother Josiah (Al-Hasan) elected anti-exilarch in 930, but the latter was defeated and banished to Chorasan. David ben Zakkai was the last exilarch to play an important part in history. He died a few years before Saadia; his son Judah died seven months afterward.

Judah left a son (whose name is not mentioned) twelve years of age, whom Saadia took into his house and educated. His generous treatment of the grandson of his former adversary was continued until Saadia&#x27;s death in 942.

===Diminished power of the Babylonian exilarchate===

When Gaon Hai died in 1038, nearly a century after Saadia&#x27;s death, the members of his academy could not find a more worthy successor than the exilarch Hezekiah, a great-grandson of David ben Zakkai, who thereafter filled both offices. But two years later, in 1040, Hezekiah, who was the last exilarch and also the last Gaon, fell a victim to calumny by a peer. He was imprisoned and tortured to death. Two of his sons fled to Spain, where they found refuge with Joseph, the son and successor of Samuel ha-Nagid. Alternatively, &quot;Jewish Quarterly Review&quot; mentions that Hezekiah was liberated from prison, and became head of the academy, and is mentioned as such by a contemporary in 1046.

===Later traces===
The title of exilarch is found occasionally even after the Babylonian exilarchate had ceased. Abraham ibn Ezra speaks of the &quot;Davidic house&quot; at Baghdad (before 1140), calling its members the &quot;heads of the Exile.&quot; Benjamin of Tudela in 1170 mentions the Exilarch Hasdai, among whose pupils was the subsequent pseudo-Messiah David Alroy, and Hasdai&#x27;s son, the Exilarch Daniel. Pethahiah of Regensburg also refers to the latter, but under the name of &quot;Daniel ben Solomon&quot;; hence it must be assumed that Hasdai was also called &quot;Solomon&quot;. Yehuda Alharizi (after 1216) met at Mosul a descendant of the house of David, whom he calls &quot;David, the head of the Exile.&quot;

A long time previously a descendant of the ancient house of exilarchs had attempted to revive in Fatimid Egypt the dignity of exilarch which had become extinct in Babylon. This was David ben Daniel; he came to Egypt at the age of twenty, in 1081, and was proclaimed exilarch by the learned Jewish authorities of that country, who wished to divert to Egypt the leadership formerly enjoyed by Babylon. A contemporary document, the Megillah of the &quot;gaon&quot; Abiathar from the land of Israel, gives an authentic account of this episode of the Egyptian Exilarchate, which ended with the downfall of David ben Daniel in 1094.

Descendants of the house of exilarchs were living in various places long after the office became extinct. A descendant of Hezekiah, Hiyya al-Daudi, Gaon of Andalucia, died in 1154 in Castile according to Abraham ibn Daud. Several families, as late as the 14th century, traced their descent back to Josiah, the brother of David ben Zakkai who had been banished to Chorasan (see the genealogies in. The descendants of the Karaite exilarchs have been referred to above.

==Character of the exilarchate before Arab expansion==

===Relations with the Academies===

In accordance with the character of Talmudic tradition, it is the relation of the exilarchs to the heads and members of the schools that is especially referred to in Talmudic literature. The &quot;Seder &#x27;Olam Zuta&quot;, the chronicle of the exilarchs that is the most important and in many cases the only source of information concerning their succession, has also preserved chiefly the names of those scholars who had certain official relations with the respective exilarchs. The phrase used in this connection (&quot;hakamim debaruhu&quot;, &quot;the scholars directed him&quot;) is the stereotyped phrase used also in connection with the fictitious exilarchs of the century of the Second Temple; in the latter case, however, it occurs without the specific mention of names—a fact in favor of the historicalness of those names that are given for the succeeding centuries.

The authenticity of the names of the &quot;amoraim&quot; designated as the scholars &quot;guiding&quot; the several exilarchs, is, in the case of those passages in which the text is beyond dispute, supported by internal chronological evidence also. Some of the Babylonian &quot;amoraim&quot; were closely related to the house of the exilarchs, as, for example, Rabba ben Abuha, whom Gaon Sherira, claiming Davidian descent, named as his ancestor. Nahman ben Jacob (died 320) also became closely connected with the house of the exilarchs through his marriage with Rabba ben Abuha&#x27;s daughter, the proud Yaltha; and he owed to this connection perhaps his office of chief judge of the Babylonian Jews. Huna, the head of the school of Sura, recognized Nahman ben Jacob&#x27;s superior knowledge of the Law by saying that Nahman was very close to the &quot;gate of the exilarch&quot; (&quot;baba di resh galuta&quot;), where many cases were decided.

The term &quot;dayyanei di baba&quot; (&quot;judges of the gate&quot;), which was applied in the post-Talmudic time to the members of the court of the exilarch, is derived from the phrase just quoted. Two details of Nahman ben Jacob&#x27;s life cast light on his position at the court of the exilarch: he received the two scholars Rav Chisda and Rabba b. Huna, who had come to pay their respects to the exilarch; and when the exilarch was building a new house he asked Nahman to take charge of the placing of the mezuzah according to the Law.

===Behavior===

The scholars who formed part of the retinue of the exilarch were called &quot;scholars of the house of the exilarch&quot; (&quot;rabbanan di-be resh galuta&quot;). A remark of Samuel, the head of the school of Nehardea, shows that they wore certain badges on their garments to indicate their position. Once a woman came to Nahman ben Jacob, complaining that the exilarch and the scholars of his court sat at the festival in a stolen booth, the material for it having been taken from her. There are many anecdotes of the annoyances and indignities the scholars had to suffer at the hands of the exilarchs&#x27; servants, such as the case of Amram the Pious, of Hiyya of Parwa, and of Abba ben Marta. The modification of ritual requirements granted to the exilarchs and their households in certain concrete cases is characteristic of their relation to the religious law. Once when certain preparations which the exilarch was making in his park for alleviating the strictness of the Sabbath law were interrupted by Raba and his pupils, he exclaimed, in the words of , &quot;They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge&quot;. There are frequent references to questions, partly halakhic and exegetical in nature, which the exilarch laid before his scholars. Details are sometimes given of lectures that were delivered &quot;at the entrance to the house of the exilarch&quot; These lectures were probably delivered at the time of the assemblies, which brought many representatives of Babylonian Judaism to the court of the exilarch after the autumnal festivals.

===Etiquette of the Resh Galuta&#x27;s court===

The luxurious banquets at the court of the exilarch were well known. An old anecdote was repeated in the land of Israel concerning a splendid feast which the exilarch once gave to the tanna Judah ben Bathyra at Nisibis on the eve of Tisha Beav. though in the more exact S. Buber&#x27;s edition, the feast was given by the chief of the synagogue. Another story told in the land of Israel relates that an exilarch had music in his house morning and evening, and that Mar &#x27;Ukba, who subsequently became exilarch, sent him as a warning this verse from Hosea: &quot;Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people.&quot;

The exilarch Nehemiah is said to have dressed entirely in silk. The Talmud says almost nothing in regard to the personal relations of the exilarchs to the royal court. One passage relates merely that Huna ben Nathan appeared before Yazdegerd I, who with his own hands girded him with the belt which was the sign of the exilarch&#x27;s office. There are also two allusions dating from an earlier time, one by Hiyya, a Babylonian living in the land of Israel, and the other by Adda ben Ahaba, one of Rav&#x27;s earlier pupils, from which it seems that the exilarch occupied a foremost position among the high dignitaries of the state when he appeared at the court first of the Arsacids, then of the Sassanids.

An Arabic writer of the 9th century records the fact that the exilarch presented a gift of 4,000 dirhems on the Persian feast of Nauruz. Regarding the functions of the exilarch as the chief tax-collector for the Jewish population, there is the curious statement, preserved only in the Jerusalem Talmud, that once, in the time of Huna, the head of the school of Sura, the exilarch was commanded to furnish as much grain as would fill a room of 40 square ells.

===Juridical functions===

The most important function of the exilarch was the appointment of the judge. Both Rav and Samuel said that the judge who did not wish to be held personally responsible in case of an error of judgment, would have to accept his appointment from the house of the exilarch. When Rav went from the land of Israel to Nehardea he was appointed overseer of the market by the exilarch. The exilarch had jurisdiction in criminal cases also. Aha b. Jacob, a contemporary of Rav, was commissioned by the exilarch to take charge of a murder case. The story found in &quot;Bava Kamma 59a&quot; is an interesting example of the police jurisdiction exercised by the followers of the exilarch in the time of Samuel. From the same time dates a curious dispute regarding the etiquette of precedence among the scholars greeting the exilarch. The exilarch had certain privileges regarding real property. It is a specially noteworthy fact that in certain cases the exilarch judged according to the Persian law; and it was the exilarch &#x27;Ukba b. Nehemiah who communicated to the head of the school of Pumbedita, Rabbah ben Nahmai, three Persian statutes which Samuel recognized as binding.

A synagogal prerogative of the exilarch was mentioned in the land of Israel as a curiosity: The Torah roll was carried to the exilarch, while every one else had to go to the Torah to read from it. This prerogative is referred to also in the account of the installation of the exilarch in the Arabic period, and this gives color to the assumption that the ceremonies, as recounted in this document, were based in part on usages taken over from the Persian time. The account of the installation of the exilarch is supplemented by further details in regard to the exilarchate which are of great historical value; &quot;see the following section&quot;.

==Character of the exilarchate in the Arabic era==

Upon their conquest of Iraq, the Caliphate confirmed the authority of exilarch on Bustanai son of Haninai, and the continuation of his governance over the Jewish community. For his political services to the Arab authorities during the Islamic conquests, he was given the daughter of the former Sassanid Emperor as a slave. Muslim authorities regarded the office of exilarch with profound respect as they viewed its incumbent as a direct descendant of the ancient prophet David. The subsequent fragmentation of the authority of the Abbasids resulted in the waning of the authority of the exilarch beyond the former Abbasid realm. Additionally, the struggle for leadership between the Geonim of the rabbinical academies and exilarchs saw the slow diminishment of centralized power. Rabbinical decentralization favored the Geonim, but remained an office of reverence to which Muslim authorities showed respect.

===Installation ceremonies===
The following is a translation of a portion of an account of the exilarchy in the Arabic period, written by Nathan ha-Babli in the early 10th century, and included in Abraham Zacuto&#x27;s &quot;Yuhasin&quot; and in Neubauer&#x27;s &quot;Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles,&quot;:

The members of the two academies [Sura and Pumbedita], led by the two heads [the geonim] as well as by the leaders of the community, assemble in the house of an especially prominent man before the Sabbath on which the installation of the exilarch is to take place. The first homage is paid on Thursday in the synagogue, the event being announced by trumpets, and every one sends presents to the exilarch according to his means. The leaders of the community and the wealthy send handsome garments, jewelry, and gold and silver vessels. On Thursday and Friday the exilarch gives great banquets. On the morning of the Sabbath the nobles of the community call for him and accompany him to the synagogue. Here a wooden platform covered entirely with costly cloth has been erected, under which a picked choir of sweet-voiced youths well versed in the liturgy has been placed. This choir responds to the leader in prayer, who begins the service with &#x27;Baruk she-amar.&#x27; After the morning prayer the exilarch, who until now has been standing in a covered place, appears; the whole congregation rises and remains standing until he has taken his place on the platform, and the two geonim, the one from Sura preceding, have taken seats to his right and left, each making an obeisance.

A costly canopy has been erected over the seat of the exilarch. Then the leader in prayer steps in front of the platform and, in a low voice audible only to those close by, and accompanied by the &#x27;Amen&#x27; of the choir, addresses the exilarch with a benediction, prepared long beforehand. Then the exilarch delivers a sermon on the text of the week or commissions the &quot;gaon&quot; of Sura to do so. After the discourse the leader in prayer recites the kaddish, and when he reaches the words &#x27;during your life and in your days,&#x27; he adds the words &#x27;and during the life of our prince, the exilarch.&#x27; After the kaddish he blesses the exilarch, the two heads of the schools, and the several provinces that contribute to the support of the academies, as well as the individuals who have been of especial service in this direction. Then the Torah is read. When the &#x27;Kohen&#x27; and &#x27;Levi&#x27; have finished reading, the leader in prayer carries the Torah roll to the exilarch, the whole congregation rising; the exilarch takes the roll in his hands and reads from it while standing. The two heads of the schools also rise, and the &quot;gaon&quot; of Sura recites the targum to the passage read by the exilarch. When the reading of the Torah is completed, a blessing is pronounced upon the exilarch. After the &#x27;Musaf&#x27; prayer the exilarch leaves the synagogue, and all, singing, accompany him to his house. After that the exilarch rarely goes beyond the gate of his house, where services for the community are held on the Sabbaths and feastdays. When it becomes necessary for him to leave his house, he does so only in a carriage of state, accompanied by a large retinue. If the exilarch desires to pay his respects to the king, he first asks permission to do so. As he enters the palace the king&#x27;s servants hasten to meet him, among whom he liberally distributes gold coin, for which provision has been made beforehand. When led before the king his seat is assigned to him. The king then asks what he desires. He begins with carefully prepared words of praise and blessing, reminds the king of the customs of his fathers, gains the favor of the king with appropriate words, and receives written consent to his demands; thereupon, rejoiced, he takes leave of the king.&quot;
===Income and privileges===

In regard to Nathan ha-Babli&#x27;s additional account as to the income and the functions of the exilarch (which refers, however, only to the time of the narrator), it may be noted that he received taxes, amounting altogether to 700 gold denarii a year, chiefly from the provinces Nahrawan, Farsistan, and Holwan. The Muslim author of the 9th century, Al-Jahiz, who has been referred to above, makes special mention of the shofar, the wind-instrument which was used when the exilarch (&quot;ras al-jalut&quot;) excommunicated any one. The punishment of excommunication is the only ecclesiastical power the exilarch of the Jews and the Catholicos of the Christians may pronounce, for they are deprived of the right of inflicting punishment by imprisonment or flogging.

Another Muslim author reports a conversation that took place in the 8th century between a follower of Islam and the exilarch, in which the latter boasted; &quot;Seventy generations have passed between me and King David, yet the Jews still recognize the prerogatives of my royal descent, and regard it as their duty to protect me; but you have slain the grandson Husain of your prophet after one single generation&quot;. The son of a previous exilarch said to yet another Muslim author: &quot;I formerly never rode by Karbala, the place where Husain was martyred, without spurring on my horse, for an old tradition said that on this spot the descendant of a prophet would be killed; only since Husain has been slain there and the prophecy has thus been fulfilled do I pass leisurely by the place&quot;. This last story indicates that the exilarch had by the Arab period become the subject of Muslim legend. That the person of the exilarch was familiar to Muslim circles is also shown by the fact that the Rabbinite Jews were called &quot;Jaluti&quot;, that is, those belonging to the exilarch, in contradistinction to the Karaites. In the first quarter of the 11th century, not long before the extinction of the exilarchate, Ibn Hazm made the following remark in regard to the dignity: &quot;The &quot;ras al-jalut&quot; has no power whatever over the Jews or over other persons; he has merely a title, to which is attached neither authority nor prerogatives of any kind&quot;.

To this day, the exilarchs are still mentioned in the Sabbath services of the Ashkenazi ritual. The Aramaic prayer &quot;Yekum Purkan&quot;, which was used once in Babylon in pronouncing the blessing upon the leaders there, including the &quot;reshe galwata&quot; (the exilarchs), is still recited in most synagogues. The Jews of the Sephardic ritual have not preserved this anachronism, nor was it retained in most of the Reform synagogues.

<doc id="345180" wikidata="Q1354172" url="?curid=345180" title="McMahon Line">
<text>The McMahon Line is the boundary between Tibet and British India as agreed in the maps and notes exchanged by the respective plenipotentiaries on 24–25 March 1914 at Delhi, as part of the 1914 Simla Convention.
The line delimited the respective spheres of influence of the two countries in the eastern Himalayan region along northeast India and northern Burma (Myanmar), which were earlier undefined.
The Republic of China was not a party to the McMahon Line agreement,
but the line was part of the overall boundary of Tibet defined in the Simla Convention, initialled by all three parties and later repudiated by the government of China.
The Indian part of the Line currently serves as the &quot;de facto&quot; boundary between China and India, although its legal status is disputed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Burmese part of the Line was renegotiated by the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Myanmar.

The line is named after Henry McMahon, foreign secretary of British India and the chief British negotiator of the conference at Simla. The bilateral agreement between Tibet and Britain was signed by McMahon on behalf of the British government and Lonchen Shatra on behalf of the Tibetan government.
It spans from the corner of Bhutan to the Isu Razi Pass on the Burma border, largely along the crest of the Himalayas.

The outcomes of the Simla Conference remained ambiguous for several decades because China did not sign the overall Convention but the British were hopeful of persuading the Chinese. The Convention and the McMahon&#x27;s agreement were omitted in the 1928 edition of Aitchison&#x27;s &quot;Treaties&quot;. It was revived in 1935 by Olaf Caroe, then deputy foreign secretary of British India, who obtained London&#x27;s permission to implement it as well as to publish a revised version of Aitchison&#x27;s 1928 &quot;Treaties&quot;. Since then the McMahon Line has been part of the legal national border of India.

China rejects the Simla Convention and the McMahon Line, contending that Tibet was not a sovereign state and therefore did not have the power to conclude treaties. However China recognizes the line as part of the Line of Actual Control between the two countries, according to a 1959 diplomatic note by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai. Chinese maps show some of the territory south of the line as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region, known as South Tibet in China. Chinese forces briefly occupied a part of this area during the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and later withdrew. 

The 14th Dalai Lama did not originally recognise India&#x27;s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh. As late as 2003, he said that &quot;Arunachal Pradesh was actually part of Tibet&quot;. In January 2007, however, he said that both the Tibetan government and Britain recognized the McMahon Line in 1914. In June 2008, he explicitly recognized for the first time that &quot;Arunachal Pradesh was a part of India under the agreement signed by Tibetan and British representatives&quot;.

==Background==

British India expanded east of Bhutan in the early 19th century with the First Anglo-Burmese War. At the end of the war the Brahmaputra valley of Assam came under its control and over the next few decades British India extended its direct administration over the region in stages. The thickly forested hill tracts surrounding the valley were inhabited by tribal people, who were not easily amenable to British administrative control. The British were content to leave them alone. In 1873, the British drew an &quot;Inner Line&quot; as an administrative line to inhibit their subjects from encroaching into the tribal territory within its control. The British boundary, also called the &quot;Outer Line&quot;, was defined to mark the limits of British jurisdiction. But it was not significantly different from the Inner Line in this region.

The British wanted peaceful relations with the Himalayan tribes who lived beyond the Outer Line. However, British influence was nevertheless extended to many regions, through treaties, trade relations, and occasional punitive expeditions in response to &quot;outrages&quot; committed against British civilians.
There is evidence that the British regarded the Assam Himalayan region as a geographical part of India irrespective of political jurisdiction. Guyot-Réchard sees them as having extended &quot;external sovereignty&quot; over the Assam Himalayan tribes.

=== Forward policies of early 1900s ===
By 1900, Chinese influence over Tibet had significantly weakened and the British became apprehensive that Tibet would fall into a Russian orbit. In an effort to preclude Russian influence over Tibet and to enforce their treaty rights, the British launched an expedition to Tibet in 1904, which resulted in the Convention of Lhasa between Tibet and Britain.

Qing China became apprehensive about British inroads into Tibet and responded with its own forward policy. They took complete control over the southeastern Kham region of Tibet (also referred to as the &quot;March Country&quot;), through which passed the Chinese communications to Tibet. An assistant amban (imperial resident) was appointed for Chamdo in western Kham to implement the new strategy. Over a period of three years, 1908–1911, the amban Zhao Erfeng implemented brutal policies of subjugation and sinification in the Kham region, for which he earned the nickname of &quot;Zhao the butcher&quot;.

Zhao Erfeng&#x27;s campaigns entered the Tibetan districts adjoining the Assam Himalayan region such as Zayul, Pomed (Bome County) and Pemako (Medog County). They also encroached into parts of the adjoining tribal territory. This alarmed British officials in the region, who advocated the extension of British jurisdiction into the tribal territory.
The higher administration of British India was initially reluctant to concede these demands, but, by 1912, the Army General Staff had proposed drawing a boundary along the crest of Himalayas.
The British appear to have been clear that they were only extending the political administration of their rule but not the geographical extent of India, which was taken to include the Assam Himalayan region.

=== Tawang tract ===
== Drawing the line ==
In 1913, British officials met in Simla, to discuss the status of Tibet. The conference was attended by representatives of Britain, China, and Tibet. &quot;Outer Tibet&quot;, covering approximately the same area as the modern &quot;Tibet Autonomous Region&quot;, would be administered by the Dalai Lama&#x27;s government. Suzerainty is an Asian political concept indicating limited authority over a dependent state. The final 3 July 1914 accord lacked any textual boundary delimitations or descriptions. It made reference to a small scale map with very little detail, one that primarily showed lines separating China from &quot;Inner Tibet&quot; and &quot;Inner Tibet&quot; from &quot;Outer Tibet&quot;. This map lacked any initials or signatures from the Chinese plenipotentiary Ivan Chen.

Both drafts of this small scale map extend the identical red line symbol between &quot;Inner Tibet&quot; and China further to the southwest, approximating the entire route of the McMahon Line, thus dead ending near Tawang at the Bhutan tripoint. However, neither draft labels &quot;British India&quot; or anything similar in the area that now constitutes Arunachal Pradesh.

The far more detailed McMahon Line map of 24–25 March 1914 was signed only by the Tibetan and British representatives. This map and the McMahon Line negotiations were both without Chinese participation. After Beijing repudiated Simla, the British and Tibetan delegates attached a note denying China any privileges under the agreement and signed it as a bilateral accord. British records show that the Tibetan government accepted the new border on condition that China accept the Simla Convention. As Britain did not to get an acceptance from China, Tibetans considered the McMahon line invalid.

== British ambiguity (1915–1947) ==
Simla was initially rejected by the Government of India as incompatible with the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention. C. U. Aitchison&#x27;s &quot;A Collection of Treaties&quot;, was published with a note stating that no binding agreement had been reached at Simla. The Anglo-Russian Convention was jointly renounced by Russia and Britain in 1921, but the McMahon Line was forgotten until 1935, when interest was revived by civil service officer Olaf Caroe. The Survey of India published a map showing the McMahon Line as the official boundary in 1937. In 1938, the British published the Simla Accord in Aitchison&#x27;s &quot;Treaties&quot;. A volume published earlier was recalled from libraries and replaced with a volume that includes the Simla Accord together with an editor&#x27;s note stating that Tibet and Britain, but not China, accepted the agreement as binding. The replacement volume has a false 1929 publication date.

In April 1938, a small British force led by Captain G. S. Lightfoot arrived in Tawang and informed the monastery that the district was now Indian territory. The Tibetan government protested and its authority was restored after Lightfoot&#x27;s brief stay. The district remained in Tibetan hands until 1951. However, Lhasa raised no objection to British activity in other sectors of the McMahon Line. In 1944, the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFT) established direct administrative control for the entire area it was assigned, although Tibet soon regained authority in Tawang.

==India–China boundary dispute ==
When India and Pakistan became independent in 1947 through the partition of India, all the territories that had been part of British India were transferred to the two new countries. The prevailing boundaries of British India were inherited. Maps of the period showed the McMahon Line as the boundary of India in the northeast.

In October 1947, the Tibetan government wrote a note to the Government of India asking for a &quot;return&quot; of the territories that the British had allegedly occupied from Tibet. Among these were listed &quot;Sayul [Zayul] and Walong and in direction of Pemakoe, Lonag, Lopa, Mon, Bhutan, Sikkim, Darjeeling and others on this side of river Ganges&quot;. Similar claims were apparently made against China as well. The Indian government did not take the claims seriously and asked instead to be treated on par with the former British Indian government. After a few months, the Tibetans agreed to the proposal.

In Beijing, the Communist Party came to power in 1949 and declared its intention to &quot;liberate&quot; Tibet. India objected at first, but eventually acquiesced to Chinese claims over Tibet and recognised China as the suzerain power.

In the 1950s, when India-China relations were cordial and the boundary dispute quiet, the Indian government under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru promoted the slogan &quot;Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai&quot; (Indians and Chinese are brothers). Nehru maintained his 1950 statement that he would not accept negotiations if China brought the boundary dispute up, hoping that &quot;China would accept the &quot;&quot;. In 1954, India renamed the disputed area the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA).

India acknowledged that Tibet was a part of China and gave up its extraterritorial rights in Tibet inherited from the British in a treaty concluded in April 1954. Nehru later claimed that because China did not bring up the border issue at the 1954 conference, the issue was settled. But the only border India had delineated before the conference was the McMahon Line. Several months after the conference, Nehru ordered maps of India published that showed expansive Indian territorial claims as definite boundaries, notably in Aksai Chin. In the NEFA sector, the new maps gave the hill crest as the boundary, although in some places this line is slightly north of the McMahon Line.

The failure of the 1959 Tibetan uprising and the 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s arrival in India in March led Indian parliamentarians to censure Nehru for not securing a commitment from China to respect the McMahon Line. Additionally, the Indian press started openly advocating Tibetan independence, with anti-Chinese sentiment steadily rising throughout Indian society due to rising sympathy for the Tibetans. For example, in 1959, Jayaprakash Narayan, one of India&#x27;s foremost Gandhians, stated that &quot;Tibet may be a theocratic state rather than a secular state and backward economically and socially, but no nation has the right to impose progress, whatever that may mean, upon another nation.&quot; Nehru, seeking to quickly assert sovereignty in response, established &quot;as many military posts along the frontier as possible&quot;, unannounced and against the advice of his staff. On discovering the posts, and already suspicious from the ruminations of the Indian press, Chinese leaders began to suspect that Nehru had designs on the region. In August 1959, Chinese troops captured a new Indian military outpost at Longju on the Tsari Chu (the main tributary, from the north, of the Subansiri River in Arunachal Pradesh.) Longju was and is just north of the McMahon Line according to the inside back cover map in Maxwell and according to notable Indian mountaineer Harish Kapadia, who explored the area in 2005. His published map and text locate Longju a kilometre or two on the China side of the McMahon Line &quot;near the Chinese garrison town of Migyitun&quot; (which is now quite sizeable, at 28°39&#x27;40&quot; N latitude, over four kilometres north of the line). (The rarely reliable coordinates in the Geonames database (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency) incorrectly place &quot;Longju&quot; in snow and ice 10 kilometres away from the river at over 12,000 feet in elevation.) In a letter to Nehru dated 24 October 1959, Zhou Enlai proposed that India and China each withdraw their forces 20 kilometres from the line of actual control (LAC). Shortly afterwards, Zhou defined this line as &quot;the so-called McMahon Line in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west&quot;.

In November 1961, Nehru formally adopted the &quot;Forward Policy&quot; of setting up military outposts in disputed areas, including 43 outposts north of Zhou&#x27;s LAC. On 8 September 1962, a Chinese unit attacked an Indian post at Dhola in the Namka Chu valley immediately south of the Thag La Ridge, seven kilometres north of the McMahon Line according to the map on page 360 of Maxwell. On 20 October China launched a major attack across the McMahon Line as well as another attack further north. The Sino-Indian War which followed was a national humiliation for India, with China quickly advancing from the McMahon Line to Rupa and then Chaku (65 km southeast of Tawang) in NEFA&#x27;s extreme western portion, and in the NEFA&#x27;s extreme eastern tip advancing to Walong. The Soviet Union, United States, and United Kingdom pledged military aid to India. China then withdrew to the McMahon Line and repatriated the Indian prisoners of war (1963). The legacy of the border remains significant especially in India where the government sought to explain its defeat by blaming it on being caught by surprise.

NEFA was renamed Arunachal Pradesh in 1972—Chinese maps refer to the area as South Tibet. In 1981, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping offered India a &quot;package settlement&quot; of the border issue. Eight rounds of talks followed, but there was no agreement.

In 1984, India Intelligence Bureau personnel in the Tawang region set up an observation post in the Sumdorong Chu Valley just south of the highest hill crest, but three kilometres north of the McMahon Line (the straight-line portion extending east from Bhutan for 30 miles). The IB left the area before winter. In 1986, China deployed troops in the valley before an Indian team arrived. This information created a national uproar when it was revealed to the Indian public. In October 1986, Deng threatened to &quot;teach India a lesson&quot;. The Indian Army airlifted a task force to the valley. The confrontation was defused in May 1987 though, as clearly visible on Google Earth, both armies have remained, and recent construction of roads and facilities are visible.

The Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited China in 1988 and agreed to a joint working group on boundary issues which has made little apparent positive progress. A 1993 Sino-Indian agreement set up a group to define the LAC; this group has likewise made no progress. A 1996 Sino-Indian agreement set up &quot;confidence-building measures&quot; to avoid border clashes. Although there have been frequent incidents where one state has charged the other with incursions, causing tense encounters along the McMahon Line following India&#x27;s nuclear test in 1998 and continuing to the present, both sides generally attribute these to disagreements of less than a kilometre as to the exact location of the LAC.

<doc id="345188" wikidata="Q7906734" url="?curid=345188" title="VEGAS algorithm">
<text>The VEGAS algorithm, due to G. Peter Lepage, is a method for reducing error in Monte Carlo simulations by using a known or approximate probability distribution function to concentrate the search in those areas of the integrand that make the greatest contribution to the final integral.

The VEGAS algorithm is based on importance sampling. It samples points from the probability distribution described by the function formula_1 so that the points are concentrated in the regions that make the largest contribution to the integral. The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) provides a VEGAS routine.

==Sampling method==

In general, if the Monte Carlo integral of formula_2 over a volume formula_3 is sampled with points distributed according to a probability distribution described by the function formula_4 we obtain an estimate formula_5

:formula_6

The variance of the new estimate is then

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the variance of the original estimate, formula_9

If the probability distribution is chosen as formula_10 then it can be shown that the variance formula_11 vanishes, and the error in the estimate will be zero. In practice it is not possible to sample from the exact distribution g for an arbitrary function, so importance sampling algorithms aim to produce efficient approximations to the desired distribution.

==Approximation of probability distribution==
The VEGAS algorithm approximates the exact distribution by making a number of passes over the integration region while histogramming the function f. Each histogram is used to define a sampling distribution for the next pass. Asymptotically this procedure converges to the desired distribution. In order to avoid the number of histogram bins growing like formula_12 with dimension &quot;d&quot; the probability distribution is approximated by a separable function: formula_13 so that the number of bins required is only &quot;Kd&quot;. This is equivalent to locating the peaks of the function from the projections of the integrand onto the coordinate axes. The efficiency of VEGAS depends on the validity of this assumption. It is most efficient when the peaks of the integrand are well-localized. If an integrand can be rewritten in a form which is approximately separable this will increase the efficiency of integration with VEGAS.

<doc id="345189" wikidata="Q705267" url="?curid=345189" title="Paul Kidby">
<text>Paul Kidby (born 1964) is an English artist, best known for his art based on Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series of fantasy novels. Kidby has created the sleeve covers since Pratchett&#x27;s original illustrator, Josh Kirby, died in 2001.

==Early life==
Kidby was born in West London in 1964. He worked as a dental technician making replacement teeth, before becoming a commercial artist and then a freelance illustrator in 1986.

==Career==
Between 1991 and 1995, Future Publishing employed Kidby and he helped design and paint more than 20 magazine covers. In 1993 he began work on Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld series. Terry&#x27;s Discworld art, and many other Terry type descriptions of pieces, are included in &quot;The Pratchett Portfolio&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot; (2004). These full versions of work and some paintings previously seen in the light of theatre. He also worked and designed an illustrated &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, a &quot;Discworld&quot; &quot;fable&quot; and number-five bestseller in the United Kingdom, his &quot;90 beautiful illustrations&quot; described as &quot;augment[ing] the impact of this vividly described magical world.&quot;

Kidby&#x27;s art frequently parodies well known paintings such as the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci, &quot;Night Watch&quot; by Rembrandt (featured on the cover of &quot;Night Watch&quot;) and &quot;An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump&quot; by Joseph Wright.

In December 2007 Terry Pratchett used Kidby&#x27;s website to announce he was suffering from early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Kidby was painting the cover for &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, the last Discworld novel, when he heard that Pratchett had died.

In August 2016 Kidby released &quot;Terry Pratchett’s Discworld Colouring Book&quot; of black and white line drawings.

In 2023 the Royal Mail released a set of eight stamps featuring Kidby&#x27;s artwork to commemorate the 40th publication anniversary of the first Discworld novel.

A jigsaw puzzle entitled &quot;The World of Terry Pratchett&quot; using original artwork from Paul Kidby will be published in October 2024.

==Personal life==
Kidby currently lives and works in Dorset.

<text>Baltimore City Community College (BCCC) is a public community college in Baltimore, Maryland. It is the only community college in the city and the only state-sponsored community college in the state. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). It was founded in 1947 and has about 5,000 students enrolled in one of its campuses.

==History==
Baltimore City Community College dates its origins to the Baltimore Junior College (BJC), founded as part of the Baltimore City Public Schools system in 1947 to provide post-high school education for returning World War II (1939/1941–1945) veteran soldiers and officers known as the Veterans Institute and was the inspiration of Harry Bard, its later dominant president and alumnus of the BCC. It was also one of the earliest examples of the growing &quot;junior college&quot; (also with some known as &quot;city colleges&quot; especially in California) an educational advancement movement which had roots in several early public high schools /secondary schools and small colleges and institutes in the post-Civil War (1861–1865) era and regained popularity at the beginning of the 20th century and has resulted in the growth of present-day &quot;community colleges&quot; in numerous cities/towns and counties all across America. This new type of college comprising the first two years of freshmen and sophomores with awarding an associate&#x27;s instead of a bachelor&#x27;s degree/diploma, was designed to serve and meet the academic and especially vocational and trade/job training of the intermediate needs between the high schools and large colleges and universities.

The BJC for its first decade of the late 1940s and 1950s was located on the third floor of the Baltimore City College, third oldest public high school in America located at 33rd Street and The Alameda in the northeast city in its landmark 1926–1928 &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; massive stone structure of Collegiate Gothic style architecture surmounted by a distinctive 150 feet high tower. The symbolic gray stone tower besides providing a sight-seeing observation level of the surrounding residential neighborhoods and five mile distant downtown skyline and harbor to the south, also coincidentally housed the first studio and transmitting antenna for the school&#x27;s public radio radio station WBJC-FM broadcasting programs across the metro area. BCC (also known as &quot;City&quot;), was a specialized academic magnet secondary school for the arts, humanities and social sciences, and had acquired its distinctive name as a result of its late 19th century curriculum of 5 and 6 years encompassing an early program combining both high school and early college education.

By 1959, the Baltimore Junior College had outgrown its sharing of the BCC &quot;castle&quot; and campus on 33rd Street and had relocated to a park-like campus of its own in the northwest city along Liberty Heights Avenue nearby the newly constructed huge popular Mondawmin Mall which both had replaced the former George Brown estate and mansion, one of the last open spaces in northwestern Baltimore. Around the same time, BJC was separated from the Baltimore City Public Schools and became a distinct entity of the City of Baltimore municipal government structure and with an independent president of the Junior College who was not also the principal of the Baltimore City College (high school) such as previously Chester H. Katzenkamp. In 1967, the name of the school was changed as the title of &quot;Baltimore Junior College&quot; was dropped and was renamed as the Community College of Baltimore (CCB) in order to not be confused with the older City College, now exclusively a secondary school and acquire the new name increasingly being used across the nation by similar growing numbers of institutions known for several decades as junior colleges or city colleges but now as Community College. By the middle of the 1970s, Harry Bard&#x27;s ideal of a second additional campus on a tight city block in a high-rise tower in the envisioning of a revitalized downtown surrounding the former &quot;Basin&quot; of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River and Baltimore Harbor and Port facilities which were gradually moving further downstream along shores with greater spaces and anchorage depths. This industrial movement left the basin with its piers, docks, warehouses, cranes etc. of port facilities more unused and declining which were adjacent to center city skyscrapers, office buildings and commercial businesses along the streets. The newly renamed Inner Harbor in the late 1950s was eventually added with Bard&#x27;s dream of an educational institution closer to the residential areas of East and Southeast Baltimore and was realized later with the construction of two buildings along East Lombard Street by Market Place, to the north across East Pratt Street from Piers 5 and 6. These were later named the Bard and Lockwood Buildings.

On July 1, 1990, the Maryland General Assembly created a new public college, New Community College of Baltimore. It was renamed Baltimore City Community College in 1992. Also in 1992, the college was censured by the American Association of University Professors for &quot;not observing the generally recognized principles of academic freedom and tenure.&quot;

In the 2000s, BCCC began to experience significant difficulties. Problems began to surface in 2004 when faculty held a public protest over issues related to remedial courses and governance. In 2010, faculty gave BCCC president Williams a vote of no-confidence and the state legislature held back funding. These troubles worsened in 2011. BCCC&#x27;s regional accreditor, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, placed BCCC on probation because of &quot;concerns about the school&#x27;s ability to evaluate student learning.&quot; To address these problems, Maryland governor Martin O&#x27;Malley replaced the majority of BCCC&#x27;s board of trustees with new members. In 2012, two years after the faculty&#x27;s initial vote of no confidence, the board of trustees removed Carolane Williams as president of the college. The interim president was Dr Carolyn Hull Anderson, followed by president and CEO, Gordon F. May.

In the summer of 2014 BCCC was warned by the Middle States Commission that the college&#x27;s accreditation was in jeopardy. MSCHE reaffirmed its accreditation on June 25, 2015.

In 2015 NASA selected BCCC and four other higher education institutions to share in $6 million as part of its Minority University Research and Education Project (MUREP), an initiative that aims to provide educator training and expand science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) course offerings.

==Campuses==
BCCC has five major locations.

===Liberty Heights Campus===
The main campus of BCCC is on Liberty Heights Avenue, located west of The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. In addition to classes and student services, the Liberty Main Campus provides services including childcare, a library, and a fitness center.

===Downtown Harbor Campus===
The Downtown Harbor campus is located on Market Place in the Inner Harbor. This campus holds the Business and Continuing Education division.

===Reisterstown Plaza Campus===
The Reisterstown Road Plaza Campus houses additional classroom space.

===Life Sciences Institute===
The Life Sciences Institute started in 1987, is one of the nation&#x27;s oldest and foremost community college biotechnology training programs. In 2009, it was moved to one of the nation&#x27;s top research campuses at University of Maryland&#x27;s BioPark.

===National Weatherization Training Center===
There is also a National Weatherization Training Center is located in East Baltimore on East Preston Street. The center is one of only 26 U.S. Department of Energy National Weatherization Training Centers and the only one in Maryland.

==Radio station==
Since 1951, the college has operated WBJC radio station. It is an FM, non-commercial, station at 91.5 MHz that broadcasts classical music and arts information programming nearly 24 hours daily all week. The station studios and office is located in northwest Baltimore, Maryland and the antenna is near the junction of I-695 and Reisterstown Road. The station&#x27;s 50,000 watt signal reaches more than 180,000 listeners weekly across Maryland, Washington, DC and portions of the surrounding states.

==Athletics==
BCCC is a member of the Maryland Junior College Athletic Conference which belongs to Region XX (20) of the National Junior College Athletic Association. BCCC athletes compete in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country.

== Granville T. Woods Scholars Program ==
Exclusive to BCCC students, the Granville T. Woods (GTW) Scholars Program awards select students with a full scholarship to pay for tuition, fees, and books. A state-of-the-art notebook computer is loaned to scholars to keep during their participation in the program. Upon completion, the computer is awarded to the graduates. During the summer, scholars are given the opportunity to study abroad and participate in internships.

The program is designed to attract and prepare high-achieving students primarily from Baltimore City Public Schools. Scholars who are selected for the program are expected to transfer to a four-year college or university to pursue, at a minimum, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in any discipline. Once they graduate from BCCC, scholars may receive a full or partial scholarship to attend Morgan State University.

The purpose of the GTW program is to challenge students at a higher level and to create an environment of interdependence which should lead to greater successful outcomes.

<text>The St. Francois Mountains in southeast Missouri are a mountain range of Precambrian igneous mountains rising over the Ozark Plateau. This range is one of the oldest exposures of igneous rock in North America.
The name of the range is spelled out as Saint Francois Mountains in official GNIS sources, but it is sometimes misspelled in use as St. Francis Mountains to match the anglicized pronunciation of both the range and St. Francois County.

==Name==

The name of the range derives from the St. Francis River, which originates in the St. Francois Mountains. The origin of the river&#x27;s name, which also was originally spelled &quot;François&quot; in the French manner, is unclear. The area, as part of the Louisiana district of New France, is near some of the earliest French settlements in Missouri, where many French place names survive. Some sources conjecture that the name honors St. Francis of Assisi (1181/1182–1226), the patron saint of the Franciscan order, but none of the region&#x27;s early explorers were Franciscans. Others propose that Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit, named the river when he explored its mouth in present-day Arkansas in 1673. Before his voyage down the Mississippi River, Marquette had spent some time at the mission of St. François Xavier, named for the Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier (1506–1552). The spelling of the river&#x27;s name shifted from &quot;Francois&quot; to &quot;Francis&quot; in the early 20th century.

==Geology==

The St. Francois Mountains were formed by volcanic and intrusive activity 1.485 billion (1.485 x 109) years ago. By comparison, the Appalachians started forming about 460 million years ago, and the Rockies a mere 140 million years ago. When the Appalachians started forming, the St. Francois range was already twice as old as the Appalachians are today.

The intrusive rocks of the area are composed of three types: subvolcanic massifs, ring intrusions and central plutons.

The subvolcanic intrusives are similar in geochemistry to the associated rhyolite volcanics, which they intrude into. They are granite with granophyric quartz, perthitic potassium feldspar, biotite and magnetite. They are intrusive into the rhyolites with development of fine grained granophyre at the contact. At depth they exhibit a coarse-grained rapakivi texture. 
The subvolcanic granites are the most widespread igneous rocks and were thought to have been covered with extensive volcanics that have been removed by erosion.

The ring intrusives are high silica bodies which were intruded along ring faults associated with caldera collapse. Rock types include trachyandesite, trachyte, syenite and amphibole - biotite granite. They are commonly porphyritic.

The central plutons are highly evolved two mica (contain both biotite and muscovite) granites. Distinctive accessory minerals include: fluorite, topaz, apatite, spinel, allanite, sphene and cassiterite. They are enriched in tin, lithium, beryllium, rubidium, barium, yttrium, niobium, uranium, thorium and fluorine and are referred to as &quot;tin granites&#x27;. Their circular to oval shape in plan view is consistent with emplacement within resurgent calderas.

The exposed igneous rocks of the St. Francois are surrounded at depth by the slightly younger (~100 my) widely distributed igneous Spavinaw terrane. The Spavinaw rocks are intersected in drill core across southern Missouri, southern Illinois, northern Arkansas, southern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma. The Spavinaw rocks occur in outcrop only near Spavinaw, Oklahoma. The rhyolites and ash flow tuffs of the Spavinaw are essentially identical to the volcanics of the St. Francois mountains (the Washington County volcanics).

The Saint Francois Mountains were formed by igneous activity, whereas most of the surrounding Ozarks are developed on Paleozoic sedimentary rocks as a dissected plateau. The localized vertical relief was caused by erosion following uplift during the Pennsylvanian and Permian periods produced by the Ouachita orogeny to the south. Elevations and strata dips in the Ozark structural dome generally radiate downward and outward away from the Saint Francois mountains.

These ancient mountains may be the only area in the Midwestern United States never to have been submerged, (as evidenced by the lack of marine fossils) existing as an island archipelago in the Paleozoic seas. Fossilized coral, the remains of ancient reefs, can be found among the rocks around the flanks of the mountains. These ancient reef complexes formed the localizing structures for the mineralizing fluids that resulted in the rich ore deposits of the area.

The igneous rocks of the Saint Francois Mts. are interpreted to be a series of caldera complexes, similar in scale to the Yellowstone Caldera complex. However, it is debated whether the igneous activity was related to a hotspot, like Yellowstone, or whether it was related to an ancient subduction zone.

=== Mineral resources ===

The St. Francois Mountains are the center of the Lead Belt, a mining region yielding lead, iron, baryte, zinc, silver, manganese, cobalt, and nickel ores. Historic Mine La Motte near Fredericktown was the site of lead mining activity by the French as early as 1720. The area today accounts for over 90% of primary lead production in the United States.
Granite has been commercially quarried since 1869 in the vicinity of Elephant Rocks State Park, a tor with huge weathered granite boulders. The red architectural granite quarried in the area has been used in buildings in St. Louis and other areas in the country. It is currently marketed as Missouri Red monument stone.

===Structural features===
Hughes Mountain contains a good example of columnar jointing in igneous rhyolite, the same process that formed Devils Tower in Wyoming and the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Ireland. The columnar jointing in this area is called the 
Devil&#x27;s Honeycomb.

== Peaks==

Mountains in this range include; Taum Sauk Mountain, Bell Mountain, Buford Mountain, Proffit Mountain, Pilot Knob, Hughes Mountain, Goggin Mountain and Lead Hill Mountain. The elevations range from . Taum Sauk Mountain is the highest peak in the range, and the highest point in the state, with an elevation of . In the southernmost reaches of the range is Clark&#x27;s Mountain, elevation , with the distinction of being the highest isolated point in the range and in the state; it reaches its top from surrounding terrain of about in less than . Black Mountain, in Madison County, has the highest rise in elevation from its base, along the St. Francis River (540 feet above sea level) to its summit (1,502 feet above sea level), a rise of just under 1,000 feet in elevation.

== Recreation ==

Five Missouri state parks – Johnson&#x27;s Shut-Ins, Taum Sauk Mountain, St. Joe, Sam A. Baker and Elephant Rocks – are located in this region. Public lands held by the Missouri Department of Conservation provide access for hiking, backpacking, hunting, fishing, canoeing, and boating. The Mark Twain National Forest contains additional public lands, including the Bell Mountain Wilderness. A section of the Ozark Trail winds through parts of the St. Francois Mountains, including a popular segment that crosses Taum Sauk and Proffit mountains.

The St. Francis River in this area is a whitewater stream in the spring when water levels are up, and it has hosted the Missouri Whitewater Championships annually since 1968.

<doc id="345194" wikidata="Q54175" url="?curid=345194" title="Subcarpathian Voivodeship">
<text>Subcarpathian Voivodeship is a voivodeship, or province, in the southeastern corner of Poland. Its administrative capital and largest city is Rzeszów. Along with the Marshal, it is governed by the Subcarpathian Regional Assembly.

The name derives from the region&#x27;s location near the Carpathian Mountains, and the voivodeship comprises areas of two historic regions of Central Europe—Lesser Poland (western and northwestern counties) and Cherven Cities/Red Ruthenia.

It is bordered by Lesser Poland Voivodeship to the west, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship to the north-west, Lublin Voivodeship to the north, Ukraine (Lviv Oblast and Zakarpattia Oblast) to the east and Slovakia (Prešov Region) to the south. It covers an area of , and has a population of 2,127,462 (as at 2019). The voivodeship is mostly hilly or mountainous (see Bieszczady, Beskidy); its northwestern corner is flat. It is one of the most wooded Polish voivodeships (35.9% of total area), within its borders there is whole Bieszczady National Park, and parts of Magura National Park.

==History==
In the Early Middle Ages, the territory was inhabited by the Vistulans and Lendians, old Polish tribes. It formed part of Poland since its first historic ruler Mieszko I, however, later on, at various times, portions of the region fell under the Kievan Rus&#x27;, the Golden Horde, and the Kingdom of Hungary, before Poland regained full control in the 14th century. Following the Partitions of Poland the entire region was annexed by Austria and included within the newly established Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. The oldest cities in the province, with over 1,000 years of history, are Przemyśl and Sanok. Rzeszów, Łańcut and Tarnobrzeg, with their castles and palaces, were important residential cities of the powerful Polish magnate families of Lubomirski, Potocki and Tarnowski.

During the interwar period (1918–1939), territory of the Subcarpathian Voivodeship was part of the Lwów Voivodeship and belonged to &quot;Poland B&quot;, the less-developed, more rural parts of Poland. To boost the local economy, the government of the Second Polish Republic began in the mid-1930s a massive program of industrialization, known as the Central Industrial Region. The program created several major armament factories, including PZL Mielec, PZL Rzeszów, Huta Stalowa Wola, and factories in other Subcarpathian towns such as Dębica, Nowa Dęba, Sanok, Tarnobrzeg and Nowa Sarzyna.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, most of the current province was occupied by Nazi Germany with the eastern outskirts occupied by the Soviet Union, and the city of Przemyśl divided between the occupiers until 1941, and then the entire region occupied by Germany until 1944.

Following the Soviet annexation of the regional capital of Lwów, Rzeszów was chosen as the new regional capital and the Rzeszów Voivodeship was founded.

The voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Rzeszów, Przemyśl, Krosno and (partially) Tarnów and Tarnobrzeg Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local-government reforms adopted in 1998.

<text>Six Flags America is an amusement park in Woodmore, Maryland, United States, near Upper Marlboro, adjacent to the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

Founded as a wildlife center in 1974 by Ross Perot, ABC television operated the park as a drive-through safari called The Largo Wildlife Preserve, from 1974 until its closure, in 1978. The property was bought by Jim Fowler&#x27;s Wild Kingdom; thereafter, the site was gradually converted from a wildlife preserve into a theme park named Wild World. In 1992, the park was renamed Adventure World after being acquired by Premier Parks, later adorning the subtitles &quot;The Great Escape&quot; and &quot;The Thrill Park&quot; in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Ultimately, the park would be rebranded as the tenth Six Flags park, after Premier Parks acquired Six Flags Inc., and adopted its name, in 1999; the name-change to Six Flags America—and all associated IP and theming—was unveiled for the park’s 1999 operating season. The &quot;America&quot; in the park&#x27;s name was chosen due to the park&#x27;s close proximity to the U.S. capital; the park’s entry plaza and “promenade” also features colonial-era architecture and related theming of Colonial Maryland.

==History==

===Early years===

In June 1971, Irish brothers Frank and William Stephenson, who were both animal trainers, approached Texas billionaire Ross Perot about financing an animal park they wanted to open “somewhere on the East Coast of the United States”. The Stephensons and Perot formed the company C.T. Industries, Inc. to build and run the park. Ultimately, they narrowed their decision down to the D.C. area, and purchased of land in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. On December 22, 1971, they applied to the Prince George&#x27;s County planning board for a special zoning exception. The park was announced to the public in February 1972, with a projected opening before the end of that year.

In 1973, plans for the park were taken-over by ABC’s Scenic &amp; Wildlife Attractions division (ABCSWA). On April 28, 1973, John E. Campbell (ABCSWA President) confirmed they were negotiating the purchase of another for the park.

The Wildlife Preserve, a drive-through wildlife park, opened on Monday, July 15, 1974. Initially, estimated attendance was approximately 850,000 visitors a year. However, those reasonably ambitious attendance numbers never materialized. In 1975, the park added narrated tours through four-car, 150-person-capacity shuttle trains. However, the park failed to promote itself, effectively enough, to generate public interest or profits. In an effort to save-face, ABCSWA announced a $30m amusement park expansion to the struggling drive-through safari (around $171.6m in 2023).

Plans for the expansion were scrapped, and, in February 1976, it was announced that the park would close permanently. ABCSWA released a statement, claiming that the park had experienced “unacceptable attendance and revenues” in 1974 and 1975; The Wildlife Preserve itself was said to be a $4m liability for ABC, for the year 1975 (approximately $22.8m in 2023).

The park stayed open with a decreased staff in 1977, but was closed altogether for the 1978 season.

Before the year 1978 came to an end, however, the park was sold to Jim Fowler, the host of &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot;. For the 1979 season, the park reopened with a guided train tour through the safari exhibits, and a smaller park with a children&#x27;s playground, animal shows, and a petting zoo. Alas, the park continued to flounder in terms of public interest, yet nevertheless remained operational for the summer, through the 1979 season. Fowler&#x27;s company ultimately bowed out as well. The park again was closed for the 1980 season.

=== Wild World ===

In the Summer of 1980, the safari was sold to a group of local businessmen, who invested $11 million into expanding the park. The animal drive-through safari remained, and the park added three flat rides, two kid&#x27;s rides and a carousel. The park was named Wild World and open by June 26, 1982. In addition to the select amusement rides, four tube waterslides were added, along with two body slides and a children&#x27;s water play area. This brought modest improvements in revenue.

The 1983 season saw the addition of four more flat rides, including the &quot;High Seas&quot; (a swinging pirate ship attraction) and giant swings. The waterslide area was expanded, at the time, to a full water park; with the addition of more water slides and a large wave pool, a more successful 1983 season was underway. Dubbed the &#x27;Wild Wave&#x27;, $2 million was spent adding the wave pool and it officially opened May 30 for the 1983 season.

Tragically, a 9-year-old boy named Christie Davis died late that summer while in the wave pool, which resulted in operational safety changes. The park&#x27;s attendance had improved, but the park was still unable to break-even. During the 1983 season, the safari was closed; instead, a guided train tour would pass through a few of the animal areas, stop at Safari Village, and tour the rest of the animal exhibits, before arriving back at the station. The Safari Village featured elephant, camel and pony rides, a petting zoo, various eateries, arts-and-crafts, and games; the crowd favorite, “Guess Your Age Or Weight” (featuring Regina Williams), proved so popular that it was relocated to the main park. The animals were sold and moved after the 1983 season ended. In 1984, most of the adult rides were removed from the park and held in storage, leaving only three, plus a few of the children&#x27;s rides. The park opted to move in the direction of being solely a water park. A new stadium was built that year, along with several more water slides. The park would perform very well on hot days, but faltered a bit more in cooler weather, due to the shift in predominantly swimming- and water-based attractions.

In 1985, the rides were therefore brought back out of storage. That year, Wild World&#x27;s management wanted to build a major wooden rollercoaster for the park in the 1986 season, but the costs were too high. There was widespread opposition to the plan from the surrounding community. In addition to adding a roller coaster, the park intended to add a 3000-seat amphitheater, and an overnight campground for guests.

At the time, Knoebels (amusement park in Pennsylvania) had acquired a used rollercoaster, Phoenix, from a defunct park in Texas; Wild World&#x27;s management team was inspired and began looking for a used coaster for Wild World. With Massachusetts’ Paragon Park closing at the end of 1984, their “Giant Coaster”, which had operated since 1917, was for-sale; in the spring of 1985, Wild World acquired the old PTC coaster, rebranding it “The Wild One” and placing it in an area of the former animal park. The coaster opened in the spring of 1986 to very positive public reviews, and is still running to this day. A kiddie coaster was added to the park at the same time.

For the 1987 season, Wild World added another water play area and a lazy river. In 1988, the park would see a renovation to its buildings and midways, and a few new flat rides. In 1989, a log flume was added, along with a family raft waterslide in the waterpark. In 1990, the park began to have maintenance issues with many of their carnival-style flat rides, with several unable to be repaired. In 1991, only nine flat rides remained and the park was ultimately put up for sale.

===Adventure World===

In 1992, Wild World was purchased by Tierco Group Inc., later known as Premier Parks, which renamed the park Adventure World. That year several flat rides and a few kiddie rides were added. In 1993, Adventure World added its second adult rollercoaster. Premier Parks had acquired Lightning Loops from Six Flags. This was a dual-track steel single looping shuttle coaster located at Six Flags Great Adventure. One of the tracks was sent to Premier Parks&#x27; Frontier City located in Oklahoma City (where it still operates today as the Diamondback), while the other track became known as the Python and would be located at Adventure World. Also, a water ride called Shipwreck Falls, in which a 15-person boat would run up a steel track and down a drop into a splashwater pool, was added. More flat rides were added in 1994. By this time, the new additions were well-received, shown as Inside Track Magazine named Adventure World as the most improved amusement park in the country for a third consecutive year in 1994.

On May 20, 1995, Vekoma&#x27;s first Mind Eraser, an inverted looping suspended coaster, opened. This was branded a SLC. In 1996, a free-fall drop-tower ride called the Tower of Doom, now known as Voodo Drop, made by Intamin was added. In 1997, the park added a second dry water ride called Typhoon Sea Coaster, which was a log flume/junior rollercoaster hybrid. It was later renamed Skull Mountain and eventually closed in July 2011 to make room for a new roller coaster. In 1997, the water park was renovated, eliminating some older slides, adding newer slides and extensively remodeling the children&#x27;s water play area.

===Six Flags ownership===
In 1998, Premier Parks acquired the Six Flags amusement park chain from Time Warner, forming the company Six Flags Incorporated. The same year, a wooden roller coaster called Roar, which was built and designed by Great Coasters International, was added to Adventure World. At the end of 1998 season, Six Flags announced that Adventure World would be branded with the Six Flags theme and renamed Six Flags America for the 1999 season. The park was officially renamed Six Flags America on October 28, 1998, and a large gala was thrown at the park to commemorate the change. Carrot cake was served in honor of Bugs Bunny the new mascot for the park. The name change allowed for the park to utilize the Looney Tunes and DC characters in its marketing.

Other changes included the addition of Gotham City, a new section in the park, and three new coasters – Two Face: The Flip Side, The Joker&#x27;s Jinx (the park&#x27;s only launched roller coaster), and Great Chase replacing Cannonball in the kiddie area. Python was closed and moved into storage.

For the 2000 season, a new hypercoaster called from Intamin opened. Its layout is a mirror image of Six Flags Darien Lake&#x27;s Ride of Steel which opened the previous year. The next year on June 16, the park opened Batwing, a Batman-themed Vekoma flying coaster located in the Gotham City area. A bungee ride called Skycoaster also opened in the area in 2001. Several flat rides were added in 2002 and a river rapids ride called Blizzard River was added in 2003. In 2005, the Paradise Island water park was upgraded and retitled Six Flags Hurricane Harbor. The transition from Paradise Island to Hurricane Harbor saw the addition of a new Tornado water slide as well as renovations to existing attractions and buildings. Tony Hawk&#x27;s Halfpipe water slide was added in 2008.

In 2010, Six Flags America renovated the Hurricane Bay wave pool deck, adding a new stamped, concrete deck and additional shading. Also the same year, the Thomas Town family area opened featuring eight rides and attractions all themed to Thomas the Tank Engine. The area was billed as North America&#x27;s largest Thomas Town and marked Six Flags America&#x27;s largest expansion in more than a decade. Several months later, Six Flags would announce the removal of several licensed agreements as a result of restructuring following the company&#x27;s emergence from bankruptcy. Thomas the Tank Engine, Tony Hawk, The Wiggles and Evel Knievel themes would be removed from all Six Flags parks beginning in 2011. At Six Flags America, Thomas Town was renamed &quot;Whistlestop Park&quot; and Tony Hawk&#x27;s Halfpipe slide was renamed &quot;Halfpipe&quot;.

For 2012, the park added Apocalypse, a stand-up roller coaster from Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, which featured two inversions and a ten-story drop. The roller coaster had previously operated as Iron Wolf at Six Flags Great America.

In 2013, the park added the six-slide complex &quot;Bonzai Pipelines&quot; to Hurricane Harbor.

In 2014, Six Flags re-themed a section of the park to feature Mardi Gras. The area would feature a new roller coaster named &quot;Ragin&#x27; Cajun&quot; and a set of Flying Scooters named French Quarter Flyers. Like Apocalypse, Ragin&#x27; Cajun was relocated from Six Flags Great America and it was placed in the former location of Two Face: The Flip Side which was removed from the park in 2007. The &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; section replaced &quot;Southwest Territory&quot; and the area&#x27;s existing rides were rethemed to match the new Mardi Gras theme. &quot;Tower of Doom&quot;, for example, was renamed &quot;Voodoo Drop&quot;.

In 2015, a flat ride called Bourbon Street Fireball was added. This ride is commonly known as a Super Loop. Similar rides were also added to three other Six Flags parks.

In 2016, Six Flags America added a new family water play structure to Hurricane Harbor named Splashwater Falls, which replaced the former Crocodile Cal&#x27;s Beach House.

Six Flags America announced on September 1, 2016, that they would be adding a Funtime Starflyer model, similar to the many SkyScreamer rides at other locations in the chain. At 24 stories (~), Wonder Woman: Lasso of Truth is the tallest ride in the park.

Announced in August 2018, Apocalypse was converted into a floorless coaster and renamed Firebird for the 2019 season.

In 2023, the park announced that the park&#x27;s Hurricane Harbor water park (now named Hurricane Harbor Maryland) would receive RipQurl Blaster, the DMV&#x27;s tallest water coaster.

==Location==
The park is located in Upper Marlboro, Maryland and is situated about east of Washington, D.C. and southwest of Baltimore. The park covers , with 300 available for expansion.

==Themed sections==

Six Flags America is divided into seven themed areas inspired by the different extremes of the United States, as well as fictional settings like the City of Gotham, and Looney Tunes: Movie Town.

===Main Street 1776===
Main Street 1776, also known as Liberty Street, or just Main Street, is inspired by Colonial North America set during the American Revolution. The buildings feature colonial design and host stores and restaurants. A replica of the Liberty Bell is featured at the entrance of the street.

===Chesapeake===
In Chesapeake guests can experience the motifs that surround life on the Chesapeake Bay. It embodies life on the water, featuring Life Savers and fishing nets caught on drift-wood. It is home to Firebird, and Roar. This area was split into two different sections, Skull Island and Olde Boston until Olde Boston was brought back in 2022. Skull Island focused heavily on the inclusion of pirates.

===Olde Boston=== 
A colonial themed area.

===Looney Tunes Movie Town===

Looney Tunes Movie Town is inspired by the Looney Tunes cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s and the aesthetic of the era. It allows guests the chance to visit the homes of the cartoons&#x27; stars, such as Bugs Bunny and Granny. The &quot;town&quot; features the Great Chase, a children&#x27;s coaster that takes guests through the set of the next Looney Tunes cartoon being filmed, starring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.

===Mardi Gras===
Formerly South West Territory, Mardi Gras is supposed to be an all year New Orleans Mardi Gras celebration. Added to the park in 2014, the new themed land features the Ragin&#x27; Cajun, a wild mouse coaster where guests are trying to escape the attack of alligators in the Bayou. This land also features The Wild One, a wooden coaster that turned 100 years old in 2017.

===Gotham City===

Added in the year 2000, Gotham City is a land that allows guests to experience the dark and dirty industrial district of DC Comics&#x27; most notorious city. Guests can be held hostage by The Joker and forced to ride his Jinxed carnival coaster. They can soar above the clouds with Superman, on the Superman - Ride of Steel, or hope to stay dry while rushing down the Penguin&#x27;s Blizzard River.

===SteamTown=== 
Recreating the pioneer days of the American frontier, the land drops guests in the frontier town of Coyote Creek. From its opening in 1994, it has offered entertainment and attractions include Renegade Rapids, a white water rafting ride down the dangerous rivers of the west inspired by the Colorado River. Coyote Creek is home to the Crazy Horse Saloon, a nod to the western saloons where cowboys used to drink and relax.

Six Flags America announced in 2023 that Coyote Creek would be shut down and completely replaced into an appropriately named SteamTown. The portion of the park will feature a steampunk-esque theming with complete retheming to rides and shopping, as well as a new stunt show. It is scheduled for June 2024 release in anticipation with SFA&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebration, as announced via Six Flags Americas&#x27; email newsletter directly to passholders. A specific date is unknown at this time.

New rides announced include: Steamwhirler, QuantumCanyon Rapids, Electro Derby, and Professor Screamore&#x27;s Skywinder.

<doc id="345203" wikidata="Q7361371" url="?curid=345203" title="Rolltop desk">
<text>A rolltop desk is a 19th-century reworking of the pedestal desk with, in addition, a series of stacked compartments, shelves, drawers and nooks in front of the user, much like the bureau à gradin or the Carlton House desk. In contrast to these, the compartments and the desktop surface of a rolltop desk can be covered by means of a &quot;tambour&quot; consisting of linked wooden slats that roll or slide through slots in the raised sides of the desk. In that, it is a descendant in function, and partly in form, of the cylinder desk of the 18th century. It is a relative of the tambour desk, whose slats retract horizontally rather than vertically.

Jean-François Oeben is sometimes credited with designing the original rolltop desk around 1760, however his Bureau du Roi (completed by Jean Henri Riesener after Oeben&#x27;s death) was a cylinder desk. The US Patent Office issued a patent for the first American-made rolltop desk to Abner Cutler of Buffalo, NY in 1882.

==Production==
Unlike the cylinder desk, the rolltop desk could be mass-produced rather easily since the simple wooden slats could be turned out very fast in a uniform way. In contrast, the wooden section of a cylinder had to be treated with great pains to keep its form perfectly over time, lest it warp or bend, and make it impossible to retract or extend. The wooden slats of the rolltop&#x27;s tambour were usually joined together by being all attached to a cloth or leather foundation, and were thus less influenced by the problems which plagued the cylinder desk.

==Usage==
The rolltop desk was the mainstay of the small or medium-sized office at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th.

Because it was produced in vast numbers and at varying levels of quality, the rolltop desk is popular in the antique market. It is usually expensive especially if the wood used is expensive. It is also popular amongst set decorators who want to recreate the ambience of an office of the late 19th or early 20th century.

<doc id="345211" wikidata="Q5654747" url="?curid=345211" title="Harborplace">
<text>Harborplace is a shopping and dining complex on the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.

== Description ==
The property consists of two pavilions, each two stories in height; one along Pratt Street, the other on Light Street. The pavilions house a range of stores and restaurants, some of which once sold merchandise specific to Baltimore or the state of Maryland, such as blue crab food products, Baltimore Orioles and Baltimore Ravens merchandise, Edgar Allan Poe products, and University of Maryland Terrapins clothing.

==History==
Harborplace was designed by Benjamin C. Thompson and was built by The Rouse Company near the former Light Street site of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company&#x27;s steamship terminal and docks. Because the land was owned by the city and was in an area designated as a park in the city charter, a citywide referendum was required to proceed with the project, championed by then Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer. The amendment &quot;limited the size of any project there to the top of the U.S.S. Constellation docked in front of the Pratt Street pavilion.&quot;

Harborplace opened on July 2, 1980, as a centerpiece of the revival of downtown Baltimore. The Baltimore &quot;festival marketplaces&quot; became an &quot;architectural prototype, despite opening several years after Quincy Market,&quot; attracting both local residents and out-of-town visitors, and spawning a series of other similar projects: Waterside in Norfolk, Portside in Toledo, and even non-waterfront projects like Philadelphia&#x27;s Gallery at Market East, Washington&#x27;s Pavilion at the Old Post Office, and Richmond&#x27;s Sixth Street Marketplace.

On the weekend of July 1, 2005, Harborplace celebrated its 25th anniversary with a ceremony featuring Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, Baltimore Mayor Martin J. O&#x27;Malley, and Baltimore Area Convention &amp; Visitors Association (BACVA) president Leslie R. Doggett.

A Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! Odditorium museum opened in the Light Street Pavilion on June 26, 2012, and closed in May 2020.

General Growth Properties (GGP) acquired Harborplace from the Rouse Company in 2004 as part its $12.6 billion acquisition of the company.

In November 2012, the property was sold to Ashkenazy Acquisitions for $100 million. Renovations were announced in 2015 and ended in 2018, three years later than expected.

On June 3, 2019, the &quot;Baltimore Business Journal&quot; reported that as of May 30, 2019, Harborplace was placed into court-ordered receivership and that Ashkenazy Acquisitions lost both management and ownership of Harborplace as a result. Deutsche Bank cited Ashkenazy&#x27;s default on its loan, a $1.13 million judgment against them for &quot;failing to maintain in good order and repair&quot; the common areas, and that &quot;multiple vendors&quot; had been unpaid for months. The &quot;BBJ&quot; reported that the Baltimore Circuit Court had appointed IVL Group, LLC of Montclair, NJ to manage, maintain, lease, provide security for Harborplace, the receivership order also authorizes IVL Group to seek a new buyer.

==Redevelopment==
In April 2022, the Baltimore development firm MCB Real Estate entered into an agreement to purchase Harborplace. The deal was finalized by the Baltimore City Circuit Court in December 2022.

On October 30, 2023, MCB Real Estate announced a proposal to tear down the existing pavilions and replace them with a 32-story and a 25-story apartment building, two commercial and retail buildings, and another retail building with an amphitheater. To proceed, the project would require a charter amendment to allow residential development, rezoning changes, and an amendment to the city&#x27;s urban renewal plan governing the Inner Harbor, which was approved by Baltimore voters in 2024.
