<text>Alton Towers Resort ( ) (often shortened to Alton Towers) is a theme park and resort complex in Staffordshire, England, near the village of Alton. The park is operated by Merlin Entertainments Group and incorporates a theme park, water park, mini golf and hotel complex.

Originally a private estate of the Earls of Shrewsbury, Alton Towers&#x27; grounds were opened to the public in 1860 to raise funds. In the 1970s, a few rides were added and some of the themed areas were developed. Inspired by Disneyland, it was transformed into a theme park in 1980 with the installation of its first roller coaster and several new rides. The park has many attractions such as Congo River Rapids, Nemesis Reborn, The Smiler and Wicker Man. It operates a total of ten roller coasters and offers a range of accommodation and lodging options alongside the theme park. Facilities include Alton Towers Waterpark, Alton Towers Conference Centre and Extraordinary Golf.

The theme park is open seasonally from mid-March to early November, whilst many of its hotels and amenities are open year-round. Special events are hosted throughout the year, including Alton Towers Scarefest (the park&#x27;s Halloween event), Oktoberfest, Fireworks, and Christmas.

==History==

Alton Towers first opened to the public on a regular basis following the opening of Alton Towers railway station. Money raised from railway excursions was paid to the earl and helped to maintain the upkeep of the grounds.

In 1924, a group of local estate agents formed Alton Towers Ltd to take ownership of the estate and began to restore the gardens as a tourist attraction. In the 1950s, this included the operation of a fairground, and by the 1970s included a boating lake and chairlift.

Property developer John Broome purchased a majority stake in the park after marrying the daughter of majority shareholder Dennis Bagshaw in 1972. From there, he began the theme park by developing new areas and installing permanent rides, including the Corkscrew, The Flume, Around The World in 80 Days, The Black Hole and the Grand Canyon Rapids.

In 1990, Broome sold Alton Towers to The Tussauds Group, then a division of Pearson plc, after his development of the former Battersea Power Station encountered financial difficulties. The change of park ownership brought another era of development, involving the opening of new themed areas and attractions, such as Runaway Mine Train (1992), The Haunted House (1992), Toyland Tours (1994), and Nemesis (1994). Tussauds&#x27; park development team from 1990 to 2002 included attraction producer John Wardley among others.

The Tussauds Group was sold to venture capital firm Charterhouse in 1998. The opening of Oblivion that same year and Air (now Galactica) in 2002 saw the park sustain new major roller coasters, both marketed as &#x27;World First&#x27; rides. In 2005, Dubai International Capital (DIC) acquired Tussauds for £800 million.

In May 2007, The Blackstone Group purchased The Tussauds Group for US$1.9 billion and merged it with its then-subsidiary Merlin Entertainments. Dubai International Capital also gained 20% of Merlin Entertainment.

On 17 July 2007, Alton Towers was sold to private investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement. Merlin continues to operate the site under a renewable 35-year lease. As of 2023, the property is owned by LXi REIT plc.

As of early 2008, the resort changed its name to Alton Towers Resort to better reflect its status as a multi-day destination. Most other Merlin-owned theme parks with onsite hotels would follow soon afterwards. In 2020, Alton Towers operated on a shortened season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, operating on a limited capacity from 4 July to 5 November. The resort resumed normal operations on 12 April 2021.

In 2021 Mixtape, Roller Disco, and Funk&#x27;n&#x27;fly were all present, located in X-Sector, Dark Forest, and Forbidden Valley respectively. In 2022 Mixtape was replaced by Spinjam, with the other 2 staying. In 2023 Roller Disco was replaced by Twistatron, but was located next to Spinjam on the former Enterprise site, instead of the Dark Forest. On 5 November 2023 the Retro Squad departed the resort permanently after 3 years.

==Alton Towers Theme Park==
The Alton Towers Theme Park is divided into 11 areas: Towers Street, Mutiny Bay, Katanga Canyon, Gloomy Wood, Forbidden Valley, Dark Forest, The Towers &amp; Gardens, The World of David Walliams, X-Sector, Adventure Land and CBeebies Land. The SkyRide cable car system travels between Towers Street, Forbidden Valley, and the Towers and takes in views of the gardens.

The park&#x27;s maximum capacity at any one time is set at 28,000 guests. According to the TEA attendance report, the park was estimated to have attracted 2,130,000 people in 2019, a 1.4% increase on 2018&#x27;s figure of 2,100,000. This made Alton Towers Britain&#x27;s 2nd most visited theme park, after Legoland Windsor, and the 13th most visited theme park in Europe. Annual admissions surpassed 3 million in both 1994 and 2010, when the Nemesis and Thirteen rollercoasters were opened respectively.

===Timeline of park areas===


  Previous themed area

  Current themed area

===Towers Street===
Opened in 1986, Towers Street is the first area that visitors to the park encounter. Themed loosely as a town street, it leads to views of the gardens and the Towers across the lake in the distance. Along the pathway are the park&#x27;s jumping frog fountains and a lawn where seasonal events take place. The first &quot;SkyRide&quot; station is located nearby, which is a long cable car transport that opened in 1987, and was refurbished 2009. The monorail moves guests from the five on-site hotels, the water park and the car parks to the theme park. In this area during the hour before the park&#x27;s daily closure, departing guests are entertained by three people wearing police costumes, two of them riding Segway-like vehicles which play party music and the third standing with an old-fashioned megaphone that is unused, and a man riding a miniature ship while dressed as a sea captain.

===Katanga Canyon===
Themed as an African village; created in 1992 and incorporated existing rapids ride. Rides include the roller coaster Runaway Mine Train and Congo River Rapids. Both are well-established rides in the park whose ride tracks share a tunnel. Congo River Rapids is a river rapids ride that opened 1986, as The Grand Canyon Rapids, and was refurbished in 1992. A 735 m long wild river rapids ride down the Congo River that lasts six minutes. Runaway Mine Train is a steel sit down powered coaster that reaches a speed of 22 mph (36 km/h) on a 1000 ft long track (305 m) and height of ; height limit 90 cm. It was designed by John Wardley for Tussauds and manufactured by Mack Rides.

===Gloomy Wood===
Gloomy Wood serves is the area containing the dark ride &quot;The Curse at Alton Manor&quot;, which originally opened with the area as &quot;The Haunted House&quot; in 1992.

In 2007, a themed footpath through the woods was added to the area, named &quot;Haunted Hollow&quot;. The pathway follows the route formerly used by the park&#x27;s old scenic railway, linking from Mutiny Bay. &quot;Haunted Hollow&quot; includes tombstones, statues and other features, some of which interact with guests using sound effects. In July 2015, Nitrogenie opened and replaced the old Waffles and Ices, a shop producing ice cream using liquid nitrogen. However, this is now closed. Gloomy Wood was suggested by the 2017 park map to be home to the new &quot;Wicker Man&quot; wooden coaster, opening in 2018. However, the park later stated that the ride was in Mutiny Bay.

===Forbidden Valley===
Forbidden Valley is set in a &#x27;research facility&#x27; run by the Phalanx organisation. Prior to a redesign for 2024, the area had a &#x27;post-apocalyptic&#x27; theme with scrapyard structures populating the area. A &quot;SkyRide&quot; station also serves this area of the park.

The area&#x27;s principal attraction is &quot;Nemesis Reborn&quot;, previously &quot;Nemesis&quot; which opened in 1994. &quot;Nemesis&quot; &quot;Reborn&quot; is a steel inverted coaster that reaches a speed of 50 mph (81 km) with four inversions, set in a rocky quarry over waterfalls. The attraction is themed as an alien creature inhabiting the quarry where the coaster is situated.

Galactica is a B&amp;M flying coaster, originally opening as &quot;Air&quot; in 2002. Air was loosely themed as a peaceful landscape, distanced from the &#x27;apocalyptic&#x27; look of Nemesis. Air was redesigned as Galactica in 2016, adopting virtual reality headsets and a space travel theme. The VR headsets have since been removed due to feedback from customers.

 is a walkthrough / ABC Rides drop tower combination. The experience is themed around the story of Nemesis, and how some eggs have been found underground in a Phalanx facility. The ride originally operated from 2012 to 2015, however on 27 May 2023, it reopened.

In May 2016, the &#x27;Rollercoaster Restaurant&#x27; opened, offering a dining experience where guests have their food delivered by looping rails. The restaurant is open daily from 10am – 9:30pm; available to guests without theme park admission after the park has closed, except during Scarefest and Fireworks events. Since its opening, the Rollercoaster Restaurant has also provided a separate entrance to the park for hotel guests.

===Adventure Land===
Adventure Land is a small family area featuring &quot;Spinball Whizzer&quot;; based on a pinball machine in which the car is the ball whizzing around the machine. The ride originally had this name, until 2010 when it was known as &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; until the name change back in 2016 when a contract ended with SEGA after six years. The ride is a Maurer Söhne spinning roller coaster, in which riders sit in cars that can spin on their base whilst travelling at speed around the track. Spinball Whizzer is now part of The Towers, alongside Cuckoo Cars Driving School, Hex and the Alton Towers Dungeon. It has a sister rollercoaster located at Chessington World of Adventures.

Adventure Land is named after the adventure play ground which previously sat on the site. The former play area was one of the attractions of a larger area called Kiddies Kingdom. In 1996, Kiddies Kingdom was split into Adventure Land and Storybook Land.

===X-Sector===

X-Sector is themed as a secretive government facility, suggested to be subjecting park guests to experimental testing. In 2013 the areas theme was tweaked to include the Ministry of Joy, making guests test subjects for their machines, including The Smiler, which was meant to &#x27;marmalise&#x27; and &#x27;correct&#x27; riders into forcing a smile. In 2015 after The Smiler crash, the areas theme was broadened and any references of marmalisation and correction was removed.

The area contains two thrill rides. The steel dive coaster &quot;Oblivion&#x27; although the drop is only 87.5 degrees the ride opened in 1998 as &quot;the world&#x27;s first vertical drop rollercoaster&quot;,designed by Tussauds and manufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard. The cars are held over the edge of the drop for between one and three seconds, before diving into a deep tunnel. &quot;The Smiler&quot; is a Gerstlauer Infinity Coaster, which opened in May 2013, that holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster at 14. The area layout was partially altered in 2013 season to accommodate the opening of The Smiler.

Previous rides in X-Sector include The Black Hole, which was a Jet Star 2 coaster enclosed in a tent, where The Smiler is located today. Energizer (later renamed Boneshaker) was a swinging gondola flat ride. It was replaced by Submission in 2001, a &quot;Chance Double Inverter&quot; flat ride, which was itself removed in 2014. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a standard HUSS Enterprise model which opened in 1984, spinning riders 360 degrees and giving the illusion of defying gravity. It was permanently removed from the resort in 2023 after being SBNO in 2022. It also featured 3 members of the retro squad (a series shortly lived themed flat rides), &quot;mixtape&quot; (ride type: smashing jump), &quot;spinjam&quot; (ride type: extreme) and &quot;twistatron&quot; (ride type: trabant). They remained from 2021–2023.

===Mutiny Bay===
Mutiny Bay is a pirate-themed family area, which opened in 2008. The area was a re-theme for Merrie England.

Attractions in Mutiny Bay include: &quot;Battle Galleons&quot;, an interactive &quot;Splash Battle&quot; boat ride, where guests sit in tracked boats while soaking other riders with water cannons. Also in the area is the rocking boat ride, &quot;Heave Ho&quot;. The park&#x27;s original teacups ride was re-themed to become &quot;Marauders Mayhem&quot;, with the tea cup cars being redesigned as gunpowder barrels. &quot;The Flume&quot; was a Mack log flume ride that opened in 1981 and was rethemed in 2004 with a sponsorship from Imperial Leather alongside Bubbleworks at Chessington World of Adventures. Upon opening, it was the longest flume ride in the world at . Late in the 2015 season, the ride and the neighboring tavern closed and were removed in 2016 to make way for the Wicker Man roller coaster and the &quot;Welcome Inn&quot; bar which shares the coaster&#x27;s theme.

In 2009, a Sea Life Centre named &quot;Sharkbait Reef&quot; opened in the location previously home to the 3-D Cinema. This includes &quot;touch pools&quot; for interacting with underwater species and a underwater tunnel.

===The World of David Walliams===

The World of David Walliams opened in May 2021 and is aimed at younger children aged 7–11. It is based on the children&#x27;s books by David Walliams. Attractions include Gangsta Granny: The Ride, Raj&#x27;s Bouncy Bottom Burp (the former Frog Hopper) and Royal Carousel (previously Galloper&#x27;s Carousel). The area has had various names over the years including &quot;Cloud Cuckoo Land&quot;, &quot;Cred Street&quot; and &quot;The Land of Make Believe&quot;, each had a similar a cartoon-inspired look, mainly featuring &quot;Toyland Tours&quot;. The area was first built as &quot;Talbot Street&quot; in 1981, becoming the park&#x27;s first themed area, home to the &quot;Around The World in 80 Days&quot; and &quot;Doom &amp; Sons&quot; dark rides. The World of David Walliams also includes many of the author&#x27;s hidden secrets such as one of the streets being called &quot;Wallibums Way&quot;.

In October 2019, it was announced that Cloud Cuckoo Land will be replaced by &quot;The World of David Walliams&quot; for the 2020 season, which will feature attractions based around Walliams&#x27; series of children&#x27;s books.

On 29 May 2020, it was announced that the opening of &quot;The World of David Walliams&quot; would be delayed from 2020 to the 2021 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Another attraction, Flavio&#x27;s Fabulous Fandango, was temporarily added to the land for opening. The land also features Raj&#x27;s Shop and various outdoor entertainment.

===Dark Forest===
The Dark Forest is themed as a supernatural woodland area; to coincide with the opening of &quot;TH13TEEN&quot;, a steel family coaster themed as a haunted crypt, that opened on 20 March 2010. Th13teen, features the &quot;world&#x27;s first freefall drop on a roller coaster&quot; – an indoor, vertically dropping track element. The ride replaced the &quot;Corkscrew&quot;; the park&#x27;s first roller coaster, which opened in 1980. &quot;Rita&quot; is a hydraulically launched steel sit-down coaster that reaches a top speed of 62 mph (100 km) that is now themed around an abandoned drag racer that is used to escape the Dark Forest.

The area was previously a cartoon prehistoric area named Ug Land, which opened in 1999, but was half-demolished to make way for Rita&#x27;s construction in 2005. Rita used to be themed around drag racing but was changed with the opening of Th13teen and the Dark Forest. With the opening of &quot;Th13teen&quot;, the area was renamed as Dark Forest and further altered with a new colour scheme and entrance feature. &quot;Rita&quot; was also given a repainted control cabin and trains, shortening its name from &quot;Rita – Queen of Speed&quot;.

===CBeebies Land===
CBeebies Land is based on the BBC children&#x27;s TV channel: CBeebies and opened on 24 May 2014. The area includes rides, shows and interactive experiences based on programmes from CBeebies, including In the Night Garden... and Postman Pat.

A new Bluey themed attraction opened on 23 March 2024.

===The Towers===
The Towers are the ruins of Alton Towers stately home and are the source of the park&#x27;s name. They belonged to the Talbot family as a stately home until 1924 and largely designed by Augustus Pugin, also noted for his work on the Palace of Westminster. The Towers are now in a state of disrepair following decades of neglect. The ruins are open to the public during most of the open season. However, some areas are closed off as part of a £1.1 million project in place to restore the oldest parts of the Towers. Key areas of The Towers include the banqueting hall, the chapel, conservatories, and Her Ladyship&#x27;s Gardens.

&quot;Hex – The Legend of the Towers&quot;, a walk-through dark ride based within the ruins themselves, opened in 2000. The finale to the ride is a Vekoma Madhouse located away from the real Towers but themed as a secret vault. The storyline is based on a local legend about the chained oak tree, located in a nearby forest, and makes use of the history of the Towers. It draws its theme from the legend of the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury who was said to be cursed by a beggar woman to suffer death every time a branch falls from an old oak tree.

The Alton Towers Dungeon was added to the area in 2019. Since the openings of CBeebies Land and The World of David Walliams; Spinball Whizzer and Cloud Cuckoo Land have been part of the area.

&quot;Cuckoo Cars Driving School&quot; allows children to drive miniature electric cars around a themed road layout, featuring visual jokes along the way. A SkyRide station is located nearby Fountain Square, giving access to other areas of the park.

===The Gardens===
Near the garden entrance is a cenotaph to the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury, who built Alton Towers and developed its gardens in the early 19th century. The monument features a marble bust with an inscription reading &quot;He made the desert smile&quot;. Other landmarks include a Chinese Pagoda Fountain, The Swiss Cottage, Miniature &#x27;Stonehenge&#x27;, and orangeries.

==Alton Towers Waterpark==
The Alton Towers Waterpark, formerly known as Cariba Creek, opened alongside the Splash Landings Hotel in 2003. It is a large (with 7 pools and 10 water slides), part-indoor and part outdoor waterpark themed as a tropical Caribbean lagoon. The waterpark features several fast slides, a lazy river, a giant tipping bucket and many other water features. Also located there are two food and drink venues: Adventures Cave and Ice Cream Shack. A separate ticket is needed for waterpark access as it is not included with the theme park entrance price.

Attractions include &quot;Lagoona Bay&quot;, which is the main tropical pool, with water cannons, geysers and waterfalls. &quot;The Little Leak&quot; is a paddling pool for young children with two small slides and interactive pipes to play with, while &quot;Wacky Waterworks Treehouse&quot; is a wooden &#x27;treehouse&#x27; with water cannons, and other interactive features to squirt passing people with.

The largest ride in the Waterpark is the water coaster &quot;The Master Blaster&quot;, with uphill sections similar to the &quot;Master Blaster&quot; at Sandcastle Waterpark, &quot;Blackpool&quot; and &quot;Nucleus&quot; at Water World, Stoke-on-Trent. &quot;The Master Blaster&quot; is a high speed water flume that contains sharp turns, drops and dark sections, and has views of the entire indoor area of the waterpark.

Other rides include &quot;Rush &amp; Rampage&quot;, twin racing slides where riders experience wide turns. This attraction requires rubber rings. &quot;Lazy River (Calypso Creek)&quot; is a slow-moving water circuit, taking riders underneath spraying water jets and tipping buckets of water. Rubber rings are available. &quot;The Tipping Bucket&quot; is a container filled with 1000 litres of water which regularly tips its contents over people standing below. &quot;Flash Floods&quot; are tiered outdoor pools with two slides leading to the middle pool and three leading to the bottom. Other swimming pools include &quot;Volcanic Springs&quot;, and indoor heated hot pool, and &quot;Bubbly Wubbly Pool&quot;, an outdoor heated pool and whirlpool.

==Resort accommodation==
The resort contains 3 hotels, and 2 sets of glamping-style accommodation:

===Alton Towers Hotel===
The Alton Towers Hotel is a four star explorer-themed hotel that opened on 10 April 1996 with 180 rooms, the Secret Garden buffet restaurant, the Chinese-themed Dragon&#x27;s Bar, the traveller-themed Captain&#x27;s Bar, a small arcade and the Emporium gift shop. A conference venue called the Emperor&#x27;s Suite is also located next the Dragon&#x27;s Bar on the ground floor. There are thirteen themed room categories. The Explorer rooms are the hotel&#x27;s standard category, while the Arctic Explorer and Moon Voyage rooms represent the mid-range offering. The themed rooms on the top two floors of the hotel include Gangsta Granny, Chocolate, Sleepover, Coca-Cola, Splish Splash, Big Pyjama, The Smiler, Arabian Nights, Princess, and Dreamy Den.

===Splash Landings Hotel===
The Splash Landings Hotel opened in June 2003. The hotel has a relaxed Caribbean theme and is attached to the Alton Towers Waterpark. It also has a four star rating and houses 216 rooms, along with the Flambo&#x27;s Jambo buffet restaurant, the Coffee Shack kiosk, Ma Garrita&#x27;s Bar, the Shack gift shop, and much larger arcade. There are three room themes: Beachcomber, Ice Cave, and the Mutiny Bay-themed Pirate rooms. The hotel is also connected to the Alton Towers Hotel by a covered walkway, allowing easy access to the Waterpark from both hotels.

===Enchanted Village===
The Enchanted Village open in April 2015, and contains 120 lodges and 5 secluded treehouses set in the fictional &quot;Enchanted Forest&quot; woodland. Situated next to the Alton Towers hotel, it features a variety of miniature playgrounds for children.

===CBeebies Land Hotel===
The CBeebies Land Hotel opened on 8 July 2017 with a total of 76 themed rooms.
There are eight themes: Bugbies, Bing, Octonauts, Postman Pat, Swashbuckle, In the Night Garden, Something Special, and Bluey.

===Stargazing Pods===
Although Alton Towers had previously gained the necessary permits to expand the Enchanted Village, these plans were eventually scrapped and reduced into a &quot;pod&quot;-style accommodation option. 102 individual pods were constructed, each sleeping up to four people.

The proposals have faced some critical views from the public, with many criticisms being raised over the capacity of bathroom facilities as well as how the resort will cope with the increased demand in food and beverages, as the Stargazing Pods will not have its own restaurant, bar or shopping facilities. The council even initially rejected the application citing lack of imagination and &quot;magic&quot;, although the plans were granted permission the second time without making any notable improvements.

The Stargazing Pods opened on 12 April 2019.

==Recreation==

===Alton Towers Spa===
Alton Towers Spa was part of the Alton Towers Hotel and opened in 2004. It included relaxation and treatment rooms and an adults-only swimming pool. Despite being inside the Alton Towers Hotel, non-hotel guests were able to use the spa. It was closed on 31 December 2023 with the resort citing future development for the area.

===Extraordinary Golf===
Opened in 2007, the Extraordinary Golf mini-golf attraction is themed to different rides and attractions at the park, some of which, are from the park&#x27;s history. Extraordinary Golf is located to the west of the Splash Landings Hotel. Extraordinary Golf was refreshed for 2016 including the addition of a Galactica themed hole.

==Future developments==
Alton Towers is located in a Conservation Area, which puts restrictions on its permissible development, notably that no structures in the park should be built above tree line and if so should be disguised from external views of the park; this can be seen on the ride Rita, where the highest sections of track are camouflaged green.

Noise pollution is also a problem for the park due to the close proximity to the villages of Alton and Farley and the town of Cheadle. There have been several cases where Alton Towers have been taken to court over the noise levels emitted from the park and have been served noise abatement orders between 2004 and 2006.

In September 2022, Alton Towers held a public consultation to propose plans for an indoor roller coaster on the former site of the Alton Mouse codenamed &quot;Project Horizon&quot;. The project was approved in early 2023, and it is not known when it will open.

In February 2024, Alton Towers submitted plans for a new flat ride near the former site of Ripsaw. It will see a new building erected on the path down to Galactica, creating an underpass, with the flat ride sitting on top. The ride is codenamed &quot;Project Ocean&quot;. Planning permission was granted in April 2024, with construction commencing in May 2024.

==Secret Weapon roller coasters==
Alton Towers has a tradition of codenaming its new roller coaster developments as &quot;Secret Weapon&quot;, or &quot;SW&quot;, followed by a number. The name is associated with the park&#x27;s inclination to promote its rides as holding &quot;world first&quot; or in some way &quot;innovative&quot; features and records. However the naming tradition actually began for unrelated reasons, since &quot;Secret Weapon&quot; was the working title of a roller coaster that was ultimately never commissioned.

SW1 was a pipeline roller coaster, planned to open in around 1992, on what later became the Nemesis site. It was provisionally titled the &quot;Secret Weapon&quot;, with the intention of theming the ride as an ambiguous weapon testing facility. John Wardley rode the Arrow Dynamics prototype of their pipeline coaster, but stated &quot;it was very slow and rather boring&quot;, as well as the requirement for such a high lift hill being unsuitable for the park&#x27;s planning restrictions. After a second layout revision, labelled &quot;SW2&quot;, the ride was scrapped and development on SW3 (Nemesis) began. The code name subsequently became the standard preliminary name for major roller coaster projects at the park.

The naming convention was briefly dropped while the Tussauds Group changed ownership under Dubai International Capital, before being continued by Merlin Entertainments beginning with the Thirteen rollercoaster in 2010.

==Scarefest==
&quot;Scarefest&quot; is the resort&#x27;s largest annual event, which runs from the first weekend of October until early November. It celebrates Halloween with a number of temporary scare maze attractions, scare zones, costumed characters and extended opening hours. Rides and areas are lit with coloured lighting at night, with most rides and attractions continuing to operate until 9pm. The Scarefest event has been running since 2007, although the park started celebrating Halloween with decoration several years before and has operated the &quot;Terror of the Towers&quot; scaremaze since 2002. The scare mazes are upcharge attractions. The 2024 season runs from 11 October – 3 November.

==Other events==

===Fireworks===
For the final few days of the season, Alton Towers host firework shows, which have been running annually since the 1990s on the Great Lawns. The shows were reduced to 3 a year following a court order in 2005. In 2006, the display was rebranded as Electric Towers, but then discontinued. However, the fireworks and laser show was reinstated in 2010 to celebrate the park&#x27;s 30th anniversary and has returned to being an annual event.

===Oktoberfest===
The &quot;Alton Towers Oktoberfest&quot; started in 2020, taking place throughout September and early October. It is based on the German festival of Oktoberfest held traditionally in Munich, Germany. The event includes themed food and drink, entertainment and extended evening hours with all rides open.

===Services Day===
Since 2015, Alton Towers have opened the park for a &quot;Services Day&quot;; a day where a limited quantity of discounted tickets (fewer than on a usual season day) are sold to those who work in public services.

===Concerts===
Alton Towers has a history of hosting concerts since the 1960s. Alternative rock band James played to a crowd of 30,000 on 4 July 1992. Concerts in recent years have included the Alton Towers Live event in 2011 and 2013. In 2010, there was a 1980s concert for the 30th Anniversary featuring Rick Astley and Bananarama and also that year hosted a P!nk concert. In the past, these concerts were often held in the car park at an additional fee, however, more recently concerts have been held within the theme park. Artists that have performed there include Tina Turner and The Black Eyed Peas.

==Incidents==
===The Smiler===

In June 2015, sixteen people were injured on The Smiler ride, with two individuals requiring leg amputations. Merlin Entertainments originally released a press release blaming the crash on &quot;human error&quot;, however the Health and Safety Executive concluded the crash occurred due to Merlin failing to put proper processes into place for operating the ride. During the subsequent court case, Merlin retracted their statement and pleaded guilty to a breach of health and safety law. The company was fined £5 million, with the court citing a &quot;catalogue of errors&quot; with Merlin&#x27;s operating procedure and training.

In June 2017, Alton Towers estate owner Nick Leslau repeated the discredited claim that the crash was due to &quot;a human error&quot;, but added that &quot;Merlin has paid a massive price, but the performance of the business has been exemplary and the share price is now at an all-time high.&quot;

===Sky Ride===
On 30 June 2004, due to a strong gust of wind, the Sky Ride cables became caught, jamming the ride. About 80 people were on the ride, and nine people had to be rescued by being abseiled down cables.

On 28 October 2007, a fire broke out in the Forbidden Valley Skyride station, leading to a partial evacuation of the park.

On 21 July 2009, another fire broke out, this time in the Cloud Cuckoo Land station, leading to the entire station being destroyed. During the latter half of the 2009 season and over the following winter, a new station was designed and built, ready for the 2010 season.

===Runaway Mine Train===

On 20 July 2006, when the train was entering the tunnel section of its course, two carriages uncoupled, with the front half of the train continuing up the slope while the rear half remained stuck in the tunnel. The front half failed to make it over the hill, rolled back and crashed into the rear half which had remained stuck in the tunnel. Six people were taken to hospital and 23 others were treated for cuts and bruises. Following the incident the Runaway Mine Train was closed for the rest of the season. The train was only returned to full length operation in June the following year.

===Wicker Man===
On 26 July 2024, the ride and queue were evacuated after smoke was seen rising from part of the track.
Alton Towers later confirmed that the wood used for the ride is unable to catch fire and the fire was later confirmed to be from a thrown foreign object.

==Court cases==
In 2004, a Private prosecution was brought against the park by a couple from the local village of Farley over the noise from the park. Alton Towers was found guilty, with the judge singling out Oblivion in his judgement. The park were fined £5000, and was later issued a Noise Abatement Order limiting emissions to 32 dB. The fine was reduced to £3500 and the noise allowed increased to 40 dB on appeal. The order lead to the park removing a recording from Oblivion that was played before the rides drop.

The couple were later granted permission to bring an injunction hearing against the park to enforce the order in November 2011, however there is no record of the case going ahead.

<text>The gymnasium () in Ancient Greece functioned as a training facility for competitors in public games. It was also a place for socializing and engaging in intellectual pursuits. The name comes from the Ancient Greek term &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;naked&quot; or &quot;nude&quot;. Only adult male citizens were allowed to use the gymnasia.

Athletes competed nude, a practice which was said to encourage aesthetic appreciation of the male body, and to be a tribute to the gods. Gymnasia and palaestrae (wrestling schools) were under the protection and patronage of Heracles, Hermes and, in Athens, Theseus.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;gymnasium&quot; is the latinisation of the Greek noun γυμνάσιον (&quot;gymnasion&quot;), &quot;public place for physical exercises; exercise area&quot;, in pl. &quot;bodily exercises&quot; and generally &quot;school&quot;, which in turn is derived from the common Greek adjective (&quot;gymnos&quot;) meaning &quot;naked&quot; or &quot;nude&quot;, by way of the related verb γυμνάζω (&quot;gymnazo&quot;), whose meaning is &quot;to train naked&quot;, &quot;train in gymnastic exercise&quot;, generally &quot;to train, to exercise&quot;. The verb had this meaning because the athletes undressed in changing rooms called Apodyteriums and trained naked, rubbing their bodies with olive oil and then cleaning with the strigil. Historically, the gymnasium was used for exercise, communal bathing (&quot;Thermae&quot;), and later scholarly and philosophical pursuits. The English noun &quot;gymnast&quot;, first recorded in 1594, is formed from the Greek γυμναστής (&quot;gymnastēs&quot;), but in Greek this word means &quot;trainer&quot; not &quot;athlete&quot;. The &quot;palaestra&quot; was the part of the gymnasium devoted to wrestling, boxing, and ball games. From the word &quot;gymnasion&quot; came also the term &quot;gymnastics&quot;. 

==Organization==
The gymnasium was formed as a public institution where young men received training in physical exercises. The supervision of the gymnasiums was entrusted to gymnasiarchs, who were public officials responsible for the conduct of sports and games at public festivals and who directed the schools and supervised the competitors. The gymnastai were the teachers, coaches, and trainers of the athletes. The Greek gymnasiums also held lectures and discussions on philosophy, literature, and music, and there were public libraries nearby.

===Origins, rules, and customs===
The regulation of the Athenian gymnasium is attributed by Pausanias (i. 39. 3) to Theseus. Solon made several laws on the subject; according to Galen these were reduced to a workable system of management in the time of Cleisthenes (late 6th century and early 5th century BC). While the origins of physical exercise regimes was thought to be Sparta of Lacaedemon, or Knossos of Crete, the practice of exercising in the nude had its beginnings in the 7th century BC. The same purpose is frequently attributed to the tradition of oiling the body, a custom so costly that it required significant public and private subsidies (the practice was the largest expense in gymnasia).

Cleinias of Crete describes the origin of the tradition of Cretan gymnasia and common meals in Book I of Plato&#x27;s Laws, and ascribes them to the mythological lawgiver Rhadamanthus.

The original iterations of gymnasia were large open areas at city outskirts, not enclosed structures.

The athletic contests for which the gymnasium supplied the means of training and competition formed part of the social and spiritual life of the Greeks from very early on. The contests took place in honour of heroes and gods, sometimes forming part of a periodic festival or the funeral rites of a deceased chief. The free and active Greek lifestyle (spent to a great extent in the open air) reinforced the attachment to such sports and after a period of time the contests became a prominent element in Greek culture. The victor in religious athletic contests, though he gained no material prize other than a wreath, was rewarded with the honour and respect of his fellow citizens. Training of competitors for the greater contests was a huge matter of public concern and special buildings were provided by the state for such use, with management entrusted to public officials. A victory in the great religious festivals was counted an honour for the whole state.

===Historical development===
The ancient Greek gymnasium soon became a place for more than exercise and training. This development arose through recognition by the Greeks of the strong relation between athletics, education and health. Accordingly, the gymnasium became connected with education on the one hand and medicine on the other. Physical training and maintenance of health and strength were the chief parts of children&#x27;s earlier education. Except for time devoted to letters and music, the education of young men was solely conducted in the gymnasium, where provisions were made not only for physical pedagogy but for instruction in morals and ethics. As pupils grew older, informal conversation and other forms of social activity took the place of institutional, systematic discipline. Since the gymnasia were favorite resorts of youth, they were frequented by teachers, especially philosophers. Philosophers and sophists frequently assembled to hold talks and lectures in the gymnasia; thus the institution became a resort for those interested in less structured intellectual pursuits in addition to those using the place for training in physical exercises.

In Athens there were three great public gymnasia: the Academy, the Lyceum and the Cynosarges, each of which was dedicated to a deity whose statue adorned the structure. Each of the three was rendered famous by association with a celebrated school of philosophy. Antisthenes founded a school at the Cynosarges, from which some say the name Cynic derives; Plato founded a school that gathered at the Academy, after which the school was named, making the gymnasium famous for hundreds of years; and at the Lyceum, Aristotle founded the Peripatetic school.

Plato considered gymnastics to be an important part of education (see &quot;Republic&quot; iii. and parts of &quot;Laws&quot;) and according to him it was the sophist Prodicus who first pointed out the connection between gymnastics and health. Having found gymnastic exercises beneficial to his own weak constitution, Prodicus formulated a method that became generally accepted and was subsequently improved by Hippocrates. Galen also put great stress on the proper and frequent use of gymnastics. Throughout other ancient Greek medical writings special exercises are prescribed as cures for specific diseases, showing the extent to which the Greeks considered health and fitness connected. The same connection is commonly suggested by experts today.

===Organization in Athens===
In Athens ten &quot;gymnasiarchs&quot; were appointed annually, one from each tribe. These officials rotated through a series of jobs, each with unique duties. They were responsible for looking after and compensating persons training for public contests, conducting the games at the great Athenian festivals, exercising general supervision over competitor morale, and decorating and maintaining the gymnasium. Beneath them in the organisational structure were ten &quot;sophronistae&quot; responsible for observing the conduct of the youths and (especially) for attending all their games.

&quot;Paedotribae&quot; and &quot;gymnastae&quot; were responsible for teaching the methods involved in the various exercises, as well as choosing suitable athletics for the youths. The gymnastae were also responsible for monitoring the constitution of the pupils and prescribing remedies for them if they became unwell. The &quot;aleiptae&quot; oiled and dusted the bodies of the youths, acted as surgeons, and administered any drugs prescribed. According to Galen, there also existed a teacher specifically devoted to instruction in ball games.

===Construction===
Gymnasia were typically large structures containing spaces for each type of exercise as well as a stadium, palaestra, baths, outer porticos for practice in bad weather, and covered porticos where philosophers and other &quot;men of letters&quot; gave public lectures and held disputations. Most Athenian gymnasia were located in suburban areas due to the large amount of level space required for construction. Additionally, these areas tended to be cooler and closer to a good water supply than similar areas in central Athens.

<doc id="354036" wikidata="Q1143064" url="?curid=354036" title="Do As Infinity">
<text>Do As Infinity is a Japanese pop and rock band that formed in 1999 with three members: vocalist Tomiko Van, guitarist Ryo Owatari, and guitarist and composer Dai Nagao. The band&#x27;s name is sometimes abbreviated as DAI, alluding to the fact that Do As Infinity was named after Nagao. Signed to Avex Trax, the band released their debut single &quot;Tangerine Dream&quot; on September 29, 1999, followed by three more singles between 1999 and 2000, which appeared on their debut album &quot;Break of Dawn&quot; (2000). In December 2000, Nagao decided to devote all his time to composing the music and no longer appeared at live events. Five more studio albums were released between 2001 with &quot;New World&quot; and 2005 with &quot;Need Your Love&quot;.

With the release of their A-side singles compilation album &quot;Do the A-side&quot; (2005), Do As Infinity disbanded on September 29, 2005. The members continued work in the music industry, with Van pursuing a solo career, Owatari working with his band Missile Innovation formed in 2004, and Nagao continuing to work with other artists at Avex Trax. The band reformed on September 29, 2008, but Nagao did not return. Do As Infinity had their first new single release &quot;∞1&quot;, in June 2009, followed by their seventh studio album &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; (2009). The band released their 11th and latest studio album &quot;Brand New Days&quot; in February 2015.

==History==
===1999===
Dai Nagao started out as a composer for an amateur band. After its disbanding, Nagao continued composing songs, sending demo tapes to more than fifty record companies in Japan. Nagao was eventually hired by Avex Trax to work as a composer. He was immediately given a task to compose songs for Ayumi Hamasaki and Hitomi. 

Eventually, auditions were held, and he chose Tomiko Van as lead singer and Ryo Owatari as guitarist. Ryo turned up for the auditions in a red tracksuit with a Fender Jaguar and his effects pedals. He was asked to perform a small segment, but instead played three songs. Tomiko sang &quot;Heart&quot; as a band member 42 hours after the Avex staff read her application. On September 29, 1999, the trio released their first single &quot;Tangerine Dream&quot;, and held a live concert at the Shibuya AX. They performed almost daily at a number of locations, ranging from Shibuya&#x27;s 109, to Yokohama Station. They additionally traveled to Fukuoka and other cities. Before &quot;Tangerine Dream&quot; was released, DAI and their fellow workers were giving out copies of their recordings for free to passersby. At their one-hundredth concert, held at Shibuya AX for free, the members of DAI recognized that the fans were the same bunch that bothered to listen to them.

The remainder of 1999 was spent performing both on the street and at in-store concerts at CD stores across the country. They also took part in choice events nationwide, including a festival in Tomiko Van&#x27;s native Kumamoto Prefecture. Their streak of street concerts ended at one hundred, with a free concert for their fans, held at Shibuya Kokaido. Photos of some of their street performances were compiled into a PV for the song &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; which can be seen on the PV Collection &quot;8&quot; as well as in the background of the &quot;Live in Japan&quot; during a performance of the song.

Do As Infinity released their second single, &quot;Heart&quot;, in December. They continued to do public appearances all the way up to the year-end Avex Millennium Count Down 1999-2000 held on New Year&#x27;s Eve in Roppongi&#x27;s Velfarre club. Heart was written before Tangerine Dream, but was recorded together in July due to the complicated drum samples. The band continued to appear on radio shows and at CD store events. Their third single, &quot;Oasis&quot;, was released at the end of January. It was their first Top 30 hit and it was chosen as the official TV commercial song for Kanebo Cosmetics&#x27; &quot;Testimo&quot; line of products. &quot;Oasis&quot; was their first song to be used in an advertisement.

===2000===
The next single, &quot;Yesterday &amp; Today&quot; was chosen as the theme song for the drama series &quot;Nisennen no Koi&quot;, which starred popular actors Miho Nakayama and Kaneshiro Takeshi and was given the primetime slot. The c/w-track, &quot;Raven&quot;, was used as the ending song to the horror movie &quot;Uzumaki&quot;, which gathered more mainstream audiences for the band.

Their first album, &quot;Break of Dawn&quot;, debuted on number three on the Oricon album charts in March of the same year, only a month after &quot;Yesterday &amp; Today&quot;. They continued to make public appearances and do numerous live performances all over Japan. In August of that year, the band released the single &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, which was used as the theme song for the hit movie &quot;Kamen Gakuen&quot;; the cover of &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; was taken in Taiwan, and the trip provided the inspiration for &quot;Shinjitsu no Uta&quot;. Also in August, the single &quot;Summer Days&quot; was released, which would go on to become a staple at all Do As Infinity live concerts, and was used as a theme song for Fuji TV&#x27;s &quot;OL Police&quot;. &quot;Summer Days&quot; is also notable for being Do As Infinity&#x27;s most well-known all-English song (following their first, &quot;Break of Dawn&quot;, from their debut album). During November of that same year, the band released the festive single &quot;We Are.&quot;, which Tomiko has often said is one of her favorite DAI songs. The band would end the year with another countdown live held at the Velfarre club in Roppongi.

Nagao resigned as front member on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 2000, and concentrated on composition thereafter. After that, Nagao appeared in front of their fans as a member only twice more—the performance of the third debut anniversary held in September 2002, and a guest appearance in the second encore of their last live concert held on November 25, 2005. Nagao decided to work behind the scenes as he was unable to manage both the production of music and the live performance and promotional campaign. Nagao only wrote songs after he stopped appearing in public, and he hardly participated in recording.

===2001===
2001 was a whirlwind year for the band. With an album and six singles under their belts, the trio was well on their way to becoming seasoned veterans in the business, but they still had not appeared on national television. That changed with the release of their first single in the new millennium, &quot;Desire&quot;; &quot;Desire&quot; was once named M-42, which was used in their street performances. The single was performed on the hit TV show &quot;Music Station&quot;. However, for some reason Van represented the band by herself. Nevertheless, the song and the band got national exposure. The televised performance brought Do As Infinity to an even wider audience, and helped to make their new album, &quot;New World&quot;, debut at number one on the Oricon charts.

In the following month they would release their first promotional video collection on DVD, simply titled &quot;9&quot;, and would go on tour throughout the month of May. After release of &quot;New World&quot;, Tomiko Van was contracted to advertise for Japanese haircare company Lavenus. Van took part in all six commercials, including one which she rode a Harley-Davidson motorbike. Van can also be seen riding the Harley-Davidson in the &quot;Tao&quot; promotional video. The B-side of &quot;Tōku Made&quot;, &quot;Signal&quot; was used as the theme song for the first commercial. Six commercials were made in total, the other three songs included &quot;Tsubasa no Keikaku&quot;, &quot;Bōkenshatachi&quot;, and &quot;Nice &amp; Easy&quot;; &quot;Boukensha Tachi&quot; was used three times.

Their ninth single was released at the end of May, &quot;Week!&quot;. The following month would see the release of &quot;Fukai Mori&quot; (&quot;Deep Forest&quot;), which was chosen as the second ending theme song for the hit anime series &quot;Inuyasha&quot;. The song was a huge hit, and would soon become the band&#x27;s signature song. The remainder of the year was spent in preparation for yet another live concert tour, which would begin in November, not long after the release of their eleventh single, &quot;Bōkenshatachi&quot;, and their third album, &quot;Deep Forest&quot;, which debuted at number one on the charts.

===2002===
January 2002 started with Van appearing on the Avex charity album &quot;Various Artists Featuring Songnation&quot;, and the release of the band&#x27;s twelfth hit single, &quot;Hi no Ataru Sakamichi&quot;, the following month. Then the band went global. After releasing a best album, &quot;Do the Best&quot; in March, the band traveled to Taiwan and Hong Kong in April for a special campaign. Their following overseas was almost as huge as in their own country, drawing 500 fans to their in-store event held at the HMV CD store in Hong Kong. They were nominated for the seventeenth annual Gold Disc Award in Japan for the best Rock &amp; Pop album of the year and won. The band took a short break upon returning to Japan, but released their thirteenth single in July, the double A-sided &quot;Under the Sun / Under the Moon&quot;. In August the band participated in Avex&#x27;s &quot;A-nation&quot; tour, performing in eight venues all over Japan.

Do As Infinity&#x27;s fourteenth single, &quot;Shinjitsu no Uta&quot;, was released in October, and sparked the beginning of a new project for the band. &quot;Shinjitsu no Uta&quot; was also chosen to be the fifth ending theme for &quot;Inuyasha&quot;. &quot;Shinjitsu no Uta&quot; became famous in China in July 2002 and was also translated into Mandarin. In the booklet of &quot;Do The A-side&quot;, Kawamura stated that &quot;Shinjitsu no Uta&quot; was actually written two years before the actual release. Dai said that he left it as a demo because he felt that something was missing in the song. Despite their success, Do As Infinity wanted to show their fans that they had not forgotten them. They advertised on their website for fans to send them short stories using the band&#x27;s previous releases as themes and using the word &quot;shinjitsu&quot; (truth) somewhere in the story. Entitled &quot;Your Truth&quot;, these stories are now available in book form. The band closed out the year with another live tour, understandably titled &quot;Do As Infinity greatest year 02: All Standing&quot;, and the year-end release of their fourth album, &quot;True Song&quot;. 

===2003-2004===
The band got busy on the concert tour of &quot;True Song&quot; and new recordings, their fifteenth single, &quot;Mahou no Kotoba: Would You Marry Me?&quot; released as their first single in 2003. It became one of the most frequently played songs at weddings in Japan, becoming one of the band&#x27;s most publicized singles of the year. &quot;Honjitsu wa Seiten Nari&quot; followed the popularity of its precedent single, it was previewed in their annual summer activity, a-nation. During this promotion period it was the first time the vocalist cut her hair short and with a bright blonde dye, she changed it back to a dark brown dye after the release of this single. The single&#x27;s promotional video was filmed during their a-nation 2003 activity and combined many different a-nation 2003 visits in different areas in Japan, marking another success for the band. &quot;Hiiragi&quot; was released in November of the same year and the announcement of the fifth album followed. Tomiko met with famous American singer, Michelle Branch, during her visit in Japan to promote her album &quot;Hotel Paper&quot;, for a magazine interview and photoshoot. After the release of &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; the group took a short break and performed in New York City, New York and Dallas, Texas in the summer of 2004 as a small warm-up for their next album; footage of this can be found in the DVD &quot;Live Year 2004&quot;. They performed in Korea during the &quot;Korea &amp; Japan Friendship Week in JEJU&quot; along with jtL. Do As Infinity performed &quot;Rakuen&quot; as the ending theme of &quot;Inuyasha the Movie: Fire on the Mystic Island&quot; in December 2004.

===2005===
In early 2005, the band were in the midst of another live concert tour, showcasing their sixth studio album &quot;Need Your Love&quot;, along with video collections and recorded live concerts. Although Dai Nagao was not as active as he was in the beginning, (he did not participate in promotional events anymore) he was still the main composer behind the band.

&quot;Tao&quot; became Do As Infinity&#x27;s twentieth single released on July 27, 2005, and the last before disbanding later that year. The lyrics of &quot;Tao&quot; described about friends parting ways and this caused many rumors among the fans about the disbanding of Do As Infinity. &quot;Tao&quot; is also the main theme of &quot;Tales of Legendia&quot;, an RPG released in summer 2005 and developed by Namco. The band announced on September 14 that they would disband on September 29, 2005, just six years to the day of their first single, &quot;Tangerine Dream&quot;. Their last concert was at the Nippon Budokan on November 25, 2005. Three days before the final concert, Dai Nagao released the last Do As Infinity song called &quot;Trust&quot; on the official website through Internet streaming. The vocals featured in this song is sung by Mizushima Kana from one of Nagao&#x27;s side project artists I-lulu.

Tomiko Van, the lead singer, pursued a solo career and debuted on March 29, 2006, with her album, &quot;Farewell&quot;. Ryo Owatari, the guitarist, worked with his band, Missile Innovation, and released their first single on February 1, 2006. Owatari also worked with other Avex artists such as Ayumi Hamasaki, Ai Otsuka and AAA. Dai Nagao went on to work with Amasia Landscape and other artists under the True Song Music label, writing songs for various artists.

===2008-present===
The band played a reunion show at the final show of 2008&#x27;s &quot;A-nation&quot;, as stated on the official BBS and blog entries of supporting musicians.

==Credit to songs==
Under the concept of &quot;Whoever the songwriter is, it is D.A.I&quot;, the credit was written as &quot;D.A.I&quot; at first, even if any other member would compose the music. After &quot;Be Free&quot; was collected in &quot;Do the B-side&quot;, it came to be specified who wrote a song, and, after re-formation, it came to be specified who composed as well. Tomiko Van and Ryo Owatari mainly write lyrics. Saiko Kawamura, which is a joint pen name of Jun Harada and Kayoko Shinchi, and Naoto Suzuki also write songs besides them. It seems that Dai Nagao composed almost all the music except for &quot;Azayaka na Hana&quot; collected in &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot;, which Ryo Owatari composed. They produced the first and the second singles by themselves, but Seiji Kameda became a joint producer from the third single; he also plays a bass guitar in recording.

===Do! Creative!!===
Do! Creative!! was a semiannual contest held by Do As Infinity and Avex Trax to give Do As Infinity fans a chance to compose songs that the band later performs. The first instance of Do! Creative!! was held between March 14 and April 14, 2009. Of the approximately 1000 songs received, three were chosen to be placed on &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;: &quot;Nighter&quot; composed by Yu, &quot;Kitakaze&quot; composed by Yosuke Kawashima, and &quot;Honō&quot; composed by Shinpei. For the second contest, held between September 1 and October 31, 2009, three were selected, two of which appear on &quot;∞2&quot;: &quot;Everything Will Be Alright&quot; by Shohei Ohi, and &quot;Haruka&quot; by Fumiyasu Sueoka; the song composed by the third winner, Nobuhisa Fujii, has yet to be revealed. Of the contestants in the second contest, about 400 were from outside Japan.

<text>Nigel Keith Anthony Standish Vaz (born 26 November 1956) is a British politician who served as the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester East for 32 years, from 1987 to 2019. He is the UK Parliament&#x27;s longest-serving British Asian MP.

Vaz served as the Minister for Europe between October 1999 and June 2001. He was appointed a member of the Privy Council in June 2006. He was Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee from July 2007, but resigned from this role on 6 September 2016 after the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; revealed he had engaged in unprotected sexual activity with male sex workers and had said he would pay for cocaine if they wished to use it.

At the end of October 2016, Vaz was appointed to the Justice Select Committee; a parliamentary vote to block his appointment was defeated. On 10 November 2019, he said in a statement that he was retiring from Parliament and would not be standing for re-election at the general election the following month.

He stood in the 2024 United Kingdom general election in Leicester East for the One Leicester party. He was consequently expelled from the Labour Party. He failed in his election bid, finishing fifth with 3,681 votes.

==Early and personal life==
Keith Vaz was born in the British crown colony of Aden, on 26 November 1956, to Anthony Xavier and Merlyn Verona Vaz. The Vaz family hailed from Goa, now an Indian state, which accounts for his Goan-Portuguese surname. Vaz is a distant relative of Saint Joseph Vaz, a 17th-century missionary. He moved to England with his family in 1965, settling in Twickenham.

His father, previously a correspondent for &quot;The Times of India&quot;, worked in the airline industry, while his mother held jobs both as a teacher and simultaneously part-time in Marks &amp; Spencer. Vaz&#x27;s father took his own life when Vaz was 14. Merlyn Vaz moved to Leicester when her son was selected as prospective parliamentary candidate for the Leicester East constituency. She was elected to Leicester City Council as a Labour councillor and served on the council for 14 years.

While in Aden, Vaz was educated at St Joseph&#x27;s Convent. In England, he attended Latymer Upper School, Hammersmith, followed by Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read law. He graduated from Cambridge University with a BA first-class Honours degree (1979), later promoted to MA (1987).

Vaz has two sisters, Valerie (born 1954), who has been the MP for Walsall South since 2010, and Penny McConnell, who is a solicitor. He lives in London with his wife, Maria Fernandes, and their two children, a son and a daughter.

==Early career==
Before his political career, Vaz was a practising solicitor. In 1982, he was employed as a solicitor to Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council; and later as a senior solicitor to the London Borough of Islington. He was selected as the prospective Labour candidate for the Leicester East constituency in 1985. At that time, he found a job in Leicester as a solicitor at the City Council-funded Highfields and Belgrave Law Centre. He remained in this role until his election to Parliament in 1987.

==Political career==
Vaz has been a Labour party member since 1982. In 1983, Vaz stood in the general election as the Labour candidate in the Conservative-Liberal marginal Richmond and Barnes constituency, coming third with a swing away from Labour of 4.3% compared with a national average swing away of 9.3%. He stood as the Labour candidate in the European Parliament election in 1984 for Surrey West, coming third.

On 11 June 1987, Vaz was elected as the Member of Parliament for Leicester East by defeating the sitting Tory MP Peter Bruinvels with a majority of 1,924. Three other Labour Party Black Sections members, Diane Abbott, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant, entered the House of Commons at the same election.

Vaz was re-elected in 1992 (majority of 11,316), 1997 (majority of 18,422), 2001 (majority of 13,442), 2005 (majority of 15,867), 2010 (majority of 14,082), 2015 (majority of 18,352) and 2017 (majority of 22,428).

Vaz has held a variety of parliamentary posts. Between 1987 and 1992, he was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, of which he was the chair from July 2007 to September 2016. Between 1993 and 1994, he was a member of the Executive Committee Inter-Parliamentary Union. Finally, between December 2002 and July 2007, Vaz acted as a senior Labour Member of the Select Committee for Constitutional Affairs.

In 1992, Vaz was given the role of Shadow Junior Environment Minister with responsibility for planning and regeneration, his first frontbench role. In 1994, the Race Relations (Remedies) Bill, which had first been introduced by Vaz, became law with the support of the UK Government, and which allowed unlimited compensation to be given to those who had suffered racial discrimination. He remained in this position until 1997, when he was given his first Government post as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Attorney General and Solicitor General. Vaz then served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department between May and October 1999. This was quickly followed by his appointment as the Minister for Europe, Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He served in this position from October 1999 and June 2001.

Other positions he held included as an elected member of the National Executive Committee and as the vice-chair of Women, Race and Equality Committee of the Labour Party. He held both of these positions since March 2007. Since 2000, he has been a patron of the Labour Party Race Action Group and in 2006 he was appointed the Chairman of the Ethnic Minority Taskforce.

Vaz was also appointed to a public bill committee, which held its first meeting on 15 November 2016, looking at the Criminal Finances Bill which aimed to tackle money laundering and corruption.

Vaz signed several early day motions sponsored by David Tredinnick MP supporting the continued funding of homoeopathy on the National Health Service.

Vaz supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour leadership election. He was a parliamentary supporter of Labour Friends of Israel.

==Controversies==
===Rushdie affair===
In March 1989, Vaz, a Catholic, led a march of several thousand Muslims in Leicester calling for Salman Rushdie&#x27;s book &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; to be banned, describing the march as &quot;one of the great days in the history of Islam and Great Britain&quot;. According to Rushdie&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Joseph Anton&quot;, Vaz had a few weeks earlier promised his &quot;full support&quot; to Rushdie, describing the &quot;fatwa&quot; against him as &quot;absolutely appalling&quot;.

===Leicester IRA attack===
In February 1990, after the Provisional Irish Republican Army carried out a bombing attack against a British Armed Forces recruiting centre in Leicester, Vaz caused public outrage by publicly suggesting that the military might have planted the bomb.

===Filkin inquiry===
In February 2000, the Parliamentary standards watchdog Elizabeth Filkin began an investigation after allegations that Vaz had accepted several thousand pounds from a solicitor, Sarosh Zaiwalla, which he had failed to declare. The allegations were made by Andrew Milne, a former partner of Zaiwalla, and were denied by both Vaz and Zaiwalla. He was censured for a single allegation – that he had failed to register two payments worth £4,500 in total from Zaiwalla. Vaz was accused of blocking Filkin&#x27;s investigation into the allegations.

===Hinduja affair===
In January 2001, immigration minister Barbara Roche revealed in a written Commons reply that Vaz, along with Peter Mandelson and other MPs, had contacted the Home Office about the Hinduja brothers. She said that Vaz had made inquiries about when a decision on their application for citizenship could be expected.

On 25 January, Vaz had become the focus of Opposition questions about the Hinduja affair and many parliamentary questions were tabled, demanding that he fully disclose his role. Vaz said via a Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman that he would be &quot;fully prepared&quot; to answer questions put to him by Sir Anthony Hammond, QC, who had been asked by the Prime Minister to carry out an inquiry into the affair.

Vaz had known the Hinduja brothers for some time; he had been present when the charitable Hinduja Foundation was set up in 1993, and also delivered a speech in 1998 when the brothers invited Tony and Cherie Blair to a Diwali celebration.

On 26 January 2001, Conservative MP John Redwood accused Prime Minister Tony Blair of prejudicing the independent inquiry into the Hinduja passport affair, after Blair declared that the FCO minister Keith Vaz had not done &quot;anything wrong&quot;. On the same day, Vaz told reporters that they would &quot;regret&quot; their behaviour once the facts of the case were revealed. &quot;Some of you are going to look very foolish when this report comes out. Some of the stuff you said about Peter, and about others and me, you&#x27;ll regret very much when the facts come out&quot;, he said. When asked why the passport application of one of the Hinduja brothers had been processed more quickly than normal, being processed and sanctioned in six months when the process can take up to two years, he replied, &quot;It is not unusual.&quot;

On 29 January, the government confirmed that the Hinduja Foundation had held a reception for Vaz in September 1999 to celebrate his appointment as the first Asian Minister in recent times. The party was not listed by Vaz in House of Commons register of Members&#x27; Interests, and Redwood, then head of the Conservative Parliamentary Campaigns Unit, questioned Vaz&#x27;s judgement in accepting the hospitality.

In March, Vaz was ordered to co-operate fully with a new inquiry launched into his financial affairs by Elizabeth Filkin. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, Vaz&#x27;s superior, also urged him to answer fully allegations about his links with the Hinduja brothers. Vaz met Filkin on 20 March to discuss a complaint that the Hinduja Foundation had given £1,200 to Mapesbury Communications, a company run by his wife, in return for helping to organise a Hinduja-sponsored reception at the House of Commons. Vaz had previously denied receiving money from the Hindujas, but said that he made no personal gain from the transaction in question.

In June 2001, Vaz said that he had made representations during the Hinduja brothers&#x27; applications for British citizenship while a backbench MP. Tony Blair also admitted that Vaz had &quot;made representations&quot; on behalf of other Asians.

On 11 June 2001, Vaz was dismissed from his post as Europe Minister, to be replaced by Peter Hain. The Prime Minister&#x27;s office said that Vaz had written to Tony Blair stating his wish to stand down for health reasons.

In December 2001, Filkin cleared Vaz of failing to register payments to his wife&#x27;s law firm by the Hinduja brothers, but said that he had colluded with his wife to conceal the payments. Filkin&#x27;s report said that the payments had been given to his wife for legal advice on immigration issues and concluded that Vaz had gained no direct personal benefit, and that Commons rules did not require him to disclose payments made to his wife. She did, however, criticise him for his secrecy, saying, &quot;It is clear to me there has been deliberate collusion over many months between Mr Vaz and his wife to conceal this fact and to prevent me from obtaining accurate information about his possible financial relationship with the Hinduja family&quot;.

===Suspension from House of Commons===
In 2002, Vaz was suspended from the House of Commons for one month after a Committee on Standards and Privileges inquiry found that he had made false allegations against Eileen Eggington, a former policewoman. The committee concluded that &quot;Mr Vaz recklessly made a damaging allegation against Miss Eggington to the Commissioner, which was not true, and which could have intimidated Miss Eggington or undermined her credibility&quot;.

Eggington, a retired police officer who had served 34 years in the Metropolitan Police, including a period as deputy head of Special Branch, wanted to help a friend, Mary Grestny, who had worked as personal assistant to Vaz&#x27;s wife. After leaving the job in May 2000, Grestny dictated a seven-page statement about Mrs Vaz to Eggington in March 2001, who sent it to Filkin. Grestny&#x27;s statement included allegations that Mr and Mrs Vaz had employed an illegal immigrant as their nanny, and that they had been receiving gifts from Asian businessmen such as the Hinduja brothers. The allegations were denied by Vaz, and the Committee found no evidence to support them.

In late 2001, Vaz complained to Leicestershire Police that his mother had been upset by a telephone call from &quot;a woman named Mrs Egginton&quot;, who claimed to be a police officer. The accusations led to Eggington being questioned by police. Vaz also wrote a letter of complaint to Filkin, but when she tried to make inquiries Vaz accused her of interfering with a police inquiry and threatened to report her to the Speaker of the House of Commons. Eggington denied that she had ever telephoned Vaz&#x27;s mother and offered her home and mobile telephone records as evidence. The Commons committee decided that she was telling the truth. They added: &quot;Mr Vaz recklessly made a damaging allegation against Miss Eggington, which was not true and which could have intimidated Miss Eggington and undermined her credibility.&quot;

A letter to Filkin from Detective Superintendent Nick Gargan made it plain that the police did not believe Vaz&#x27;s mother ever received the phone call and the person who came closest to being prosecuted was not Eggington but Vaz. Gargan said that the police had considered a range of possible offences, including wasteful employment of the police, and an attempt to pervert the course of justice. Leicestershire Police eventually decided not to prosecute. &quot;We cannot rule out a tactical motivation for Mr Vaz&#x27;s contact with Leicestershire Constabulary but the evidence does not support further investigation of any attempt to pervert the course of justice.&quot;

The complaints the committee upheld against Vaz were:

* That he had given misleading information to the Standards and Privileges Committee and Filkin about his financial relationship to the Hinduja brothers.
* That he had failed to register his paid employment at the Leicester Law Centre when he first entered Parliament in 1987.
* That he had failed to register a donation from the Caparo group in 1993.

It was concluded that Vaz had &quot;committed serious breaches of the Code of Conduct and showed contempt for the House&quot; and it was recommended that he be suspended from the House of Commons for one month.

Vaz was represented by his solicitor Sir Geoffrey Bindman.

===Nadhmi Auchi===
In 2001, it was revealed that Vaz had assisted Anglo-Iraqi billionaire Nadhmi Auchi in his attempts to avoid extradition to France. Opposition MPs called for an investigation into what one dubbed &quot;Hinduja Mark II&quot;.

Auchi was wanted for questioning by French police for his alleged role in the Elf Aquitaine fraud scandal which led to the arrest of a former French Foreign Minister. The warrant issued by French authorities in July 2000 accused Auchi of &quot;complicity in the misuse of company assets and receiving embezzled company assets&quot;. It also covered Auchi&#x27;s associate Nasir Abid and stated that, if found guilty of the alleged offences, both men could face 109 years in jail.

Vaz was a director of the British arm of Auchi&#x27;s corporation, General Mediterranean Holdings (GMH), whose previous directors had included Lords Steel and Lamont, and Jacques Santer. Vaz used his political influence on GMH&#x27;s behalf; this included a party in the Park Lane Hilton to celebrate the 20th anniversary of GMH on 23 April 1999, where Lord Sainsbury presented Auchi with a painting of the House of Commons signed by Tony Blair, the Opposition leaders, and over 100 other leading British politicians. Lord Sainsbury later told &quot;The Observer&quot; that he did this &quot;as a favour for Keith Vaz&quot;. In May 1999, Vaz resigned his post as a director after he was appointed a Minister. In a statement to &quot;The Observer&quot;, a GMH spokesman said that Vaz had been invited to become a GMH director in January 1999, yet company accounts showed Vaz as a director for the financial year ending December 1998.

Labour confirmed in May 2001 that Auchi had called Vaz at home about the arrest warrant to ask him for advice. A spokesman said that Vaz &quot;made some factual inquiries to the Home Office about the [extradition] procedure.&quot; This included advising Auchi to consult his local MP. The spokesman stressed that Vaz acted properly at all times and was often contacted by members of Britain&#x27;s ethnic communities for help. In a Commons answer to Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker earlier the same month Vaz confirmed that &quot;details of enquiries by Mr Auchi have been passed to the Home Office&quot;.

===Campaign against video game violence===
Following the February 2004 murder of a fourteen-year-old boy, Vaz asked for an investigation of the relationship between the video games and violence, saying the parents of the victim believed that the killer was influenced by the video game &quot;Manhunt&quot;. Although the police dismissed the claim and the only copy found belonged to the victim, Tony Blair said the game was unsuitable for children and agreed to discuss with the Home Secretary what action could be taken.
The sequel, &quot;Manhunt 2&quot;, described by the British Board of Film Classification as &quot;distinguishable ... by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone&quot;, became the first video game banned by the BBFC in the UK for 10 years. Vaz said: &quot;This is an excellent decision by the British Board of Film Classification, showing that game publishers cannot expect to get interactive games where players take the part of killers engaged in &#x27;casual sadism&#x27; and murder.&quot;

Vaz has also criticised &quot;Bully&quot;, which had a pre-release screenshot showing three uniformed pupils fighting and kicking. In 2005, he asked Geoff Hoon: &quot;Does the leader of the house share my concern at the decision of Rockstar Games to publish a new game called &quot;Bully&quot; in which players use their on-screen persona to kick and punch other schoolchildren?&quot; Due to the controversy surrounding the &quot;Bully&quot; title, the game was released in the UK in 2006 under an alternative name, &quot;Canis Canem Edit&quot;, though the original title was restored when the game was re-released in 2008. Both releases of the game were rated 15 by the BBFC and were generally positively received by critics.

In October 2010, Vaz put down an early day motion noting that the 2009–10 Malmö shootings &quot;have been associated with the violent video game &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;&quot;. The EDM also noted that the game had been previously banned in Brazil and also been associated with US College Campus massacres in 2007. It called on the Government to ensure the purchase of video games by minors was controlled and that parents were provided with clear information on any violent content.

===Home Affairs Select Committee===
In July 2007, Vaz was elected as the chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee. Select committee members are usually proposed by the Committee of Selection which, under the Standing Orders of the House, nominates members to select committees, but unusually Vaz was the only nomination made by Harriet Harman, Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Harman argued that this was because there was not sufficient time to go through the usual procedure before the impending summer recess. The Chairman of the Committee of Selection told the House that the committee had been ready to meet earlier that week, but had been advised by the Government that there was no business for it to transact. Vaz replaced John Denham on 26 July 2007. Vaz was re-elected to the committee&#x27;s chairmanship in June 2015.

====Speculation over Counter-Terrorism Bill====
Vaz&#x27;s backing for the 42-day terrorist detention without charge &quot;was seen as crucial by the Government&quot;.
During the debate on 10 June 2008, the day before the key vote, Vaz was asked in Parliament whether he had been offered an honour for his support. He said: &quot;No, it was certainly not offered—but I do not know; there is still time.&quot;
The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; printed a hand written letter to Vaz, written the day after the vote, then Chief Whip Geoff Hoon wrote:

Vaz wrote to the Press Council complaining the story was inaccurate, that the letter had been obtained by subterfuge and that he had not been contacted before the story was published. The complaint was rejected as the article made it clear that the reports of an honour were just speculation which Vaz had already publicly denied.

====Conflict of interest====

In September 2008, Vaz faced pressure to explain why he failed to declare an interest when he intervened in an official investigation into the business dealings of a close friend, solicitor Shahrokh Mireskandari, who has played a role in several racial discrimination cases against the Metropolitan Police, and who was representing Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur in his racial discrimination case against Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Ian Blair.

The Solicitors Regulation Authority began an investigation into Mireskandari&#x27;s legal firm, Dean and Dean, in January 2008 after a number of complaints about its conduct. Vaz wrote a joint letter with fellow Labour MP Virendra Sharma to the authority&#x27;s chief executive, Anthony Townsend, in February 2008 on official House of Commons stationery. He cited a complaint he had received from Mireskandari and alleged &quot;discriminatory conduct&quot; in its investigation into Dean and Dean. The Authority was forced to set up an independent working party to look into whether it had disproportionately targeted non-white lawyers for investigation.

Liberal Democrat deputy leader Vince Cable said that Vaz should make a public statement to clear up his role in the affair. &quot;It is quite unreasonable that an independent regulator should have been undermined in this way. I would hope that the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee will give a full public statement.&quot;

====Detention without charge inquiry====
In September 2008, Vaz came under pressure when it was revealed that he had sought the private views of Prime Minister Gordon Brown in connection with the committee&#x27;s independent report into government plans to extend the detention of terror suspects beyond 28 days. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that emails suggested that Vaz had secretly contacted the Prime Minister about the committee&#x27;s draft report and proposed a meeting because &quot;we need to get his [Brown&#x27;s] suggestions&quot;. An email was sent in November 2007 to Ian Austin, Gordon Brown&#x27;s parliamentary private secretary, and copied to Fiona Gordon, at the time Brown&#x27;s political adviser. Another leaked email showed that Vaz had also sent extracts of the committee&#x27;s draft report to the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, for his comments; according to Parliament&#x27;s standing orders, the chairman of the Select Committee cannot take evidence from a witness without at least two other committee members being present.

Shami Chakrabarti, then director of human rights group Liberty, compared it to a judge deciding a case privately emailing one of the parties to seek their suggestions.

Vaz denied that he invited Brown to contribute, except as a witness to the committee.

===Other issues and incidents since 2008===

====Parliamentary expenses====
Vaz&#x27;s total expenses of £173,937 in 2008/2009 were ranked 45th out of 647 MPs, with office running costs and staffing costs accounting for 70% of this. The register of Member&#x27;s interests shows that he owns the constituency office. His second home expenses, ranked 83 out of 647 at £23,831 in 2008/2009 were the subject of a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article. Vaz who lives in Stanmore, a 45-minute journey time from Parliament, claimed mortgage interest on a flat in Westminster he bought in 2003.

In May 2007, after claiming for the flat&#x27;s service and council tax, he switched his designated second home to his constituency office and bought furniture. The report into the Parliamentary expenses scandal by Sir Thomas Legg showed that 343 MPs had been asked to repay some money and Vaz was asked to repay £1514 due to furnishing items exceeding allowable cost. New expenses rules published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority which came into force after the 2010 general election limit the second home allowance to £1,450 a month, i.e. the Westminster cost of renting a one bedroomed flat. Profits made on existing second homes will be recouped.

====Patrick Mercer affair====
Vaz was one of the members of the Commons who agreed to be on the all-party parliamentary group on Fiji proposed by Patrick Mercer MP as part of his paid advocacy for lobbyists. Mercer was recorded describing Vaz as &quot;a crook of the first order&quot;, adding that he had &quot;never met an operator like him ... I mean it&#x27;s not always completely ethical but it&#x27;s stunning, he is an operator&quot;. Such comments on Vaz and on other politicians were a reason for the Committee on Standards deciding that Mercer had brought the House of Commons into disrepute.

==== 2015 election campaign loudspeaker use ====

In April 2015, a video showing Vaz speaking using loudspeakers from a campaign car caused a row with Leicester Conservatives. Using a loudspeaker on the street is an offence that carries a penalty of up to £5,000, and there is no exemption for political campaigning.

The incident was investigated by noise pollution officers of Leicester City Council, with officials confirming in June that it was illegal but that no action would be taken.

==== Male prostitute revelations ====
Allegations about Vaz were published by the British tabloid &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; in early September 2016. It was reported that he had engaged in unprotected sexual activity with male prostitutes and had told them he would pay for cocaine if they wished to use it. He told the prostitutes that his name was Jim and that he was an industrial washing machine salesman. Vaz later apologised for his actions. &quot;It is deeply troubling that a national newspaper should have paid individuals who have acted in this way&quot;, he said. Vaz resigned as chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee on 6 September 2016.

At the end of October 2016, Vaz was appointed to the Justice Select Committee, after he had put himself forward and was nominated by his party. A House of Commons motion to block this development was defeated; motions of this kind are rare. According to Laura Hughes of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Conservative Party whips told their MPs to vote for Vaz in the division to prevent a precedent being created of such appointments being rejected by MPs. Over 150 Conservative MPs voted in support of Vaz. The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen asked in the chamber of Vaz; &quot;If the right honourable member for Leicester East found himself last month to be not fit to be chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee and the matters are unresolved, what makes him think that he is a fit and proper person this month?&quot;

The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Hudson, announced an investigation into Vaz&#x27;s conduct. The Standards Commissioner&#x27;s investigation was halted &quot;for medical reasons&quot; in December 2017. The inquiry recommenced in March 2018 and, in October 2019, under the stewardship of the new Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, the inquiry recommended that Keith Vaz be suspended from Parliament for six months. The inquiry report confirmed that, in her memorandum, the Commissioner had concluded &quot;... it is more likely than not that Mr Vaz has engaged in paid sexual activity&quot; and there was &quot;evidence of Mr Vaz&#x27;s apparent willingness to purchase controlled drugs for others to use&quot;. The Commissioner&#x27;s memorandum also concluded Vaz &quot;shows disregard for the law and that, in turn, is disrespectful to the House and fellow Members, who collectively are responsible for making those laws. Mr Vaz&#x27;s conduct has also been disrespectful of the House&#x27;s system of standards. He has not &quot;co-operated at all stages&quot; with the investigation process. He has failed, repeatedly, to answer direct questions; he has given incomplete answers and his account has, in parts, been incredible&quot;. On 31 October 2019, MPs voted in favour of the suspension.

====Bullying allegations====
Allegations were published in August 2018 by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; that a former Clerk of the House of Commons, Jenny McCullough, was bullied by Vaz as she was trying to uphold the Standards of the House. Among other allegations, McCullough alleged that Vaz made jokes about her being a security threat, on account of her Northern Irish background and accent. In September 2021, Parliament&#x27;s standards commissioner and the Independent Expert Panel found the allegations to be credible, saying the bullying &quot;was hostile, sustained, harmful and unworthy of a Member of Parliament&quot;; the Panel concluded that Vaz should never be given a Parliamentary pass again.

====Daman, India – Indigenous land clearing====

Valuable seafront land along the stretch from Moti Daman Lighthouse to Jampore beach is claimed to be owned by indigenous tribal fishing communities who have lived there for generations, as well as by NRI Damanese predominantly living in Leicester. In December 2018, local residents received documents instructed by State Administrator Praful Khoda Patel ordering the confiscation of their land and demolition of homes to make way for development. With 11,000 Damanese living in the Leicester East constituency, members of the community appealed to Keith Vaz, who flew out to Daman to meet Praful Patel. In January 2019 Vaz reported back:

&quot;I believe that Mr Patel has a vision for Daman and he wants to develop it as a tourist and education centre. I was particularly impressed by the commitments made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in order to enhance the development of Daman. Mr Patel promised that there would be no further demolitions until after the court has made its ruling and that he would talk to me about any further matters concerning this issue. I welcomed his constructive and positive approach.&quot;

However, by November, the bulldozing went ahead and the Daman protests began. On 3 November 2019, Daman Collector Rakesh Minhas issued a Section 144 order banning peaceful assembly of four or more persons, slogan-shouting and the use of loudspeakers across the entire district and ordered the conversion of two highschools into &#x27;temporary jails&#x27;. Seventy protesters were held in these &#x27;temporary jails&#x27; and another 8 arrests were made. Few of the adivasi fisherfolk were rehoused whilst most languished traumatised and homeless on the streets near the rubble of their razed homes. , the site is now billionaire Binod Chaudhary of CG Corp Global&#x27;s Fern Seaside Luxurious Tent Resort, offering tent accommodation to tourists for £57 per night.

== Standing down from Parliament ==
Following the vote in October 2019 by MPs to endorse Vaz&#x27;s suspension in the wake of the preceding scandals, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; published an article asking: &quot;Why is Keith Vaz even in Parliament?&quot; The article noted that: &quot;He resigned as a minister in 2001, was suspended in 2002, named in the 2009 expenses scandal... His ability to survive certainly suggests something in our democratic system is broken.&quot;

On 10 November 2019, Vaz released a statement that he was retiring from Parliament. His six-month suspension meant he would have been subject to a recall petition which could trigger a by-election if supported by 10% of his constituents.

== After Parliament ==
Vaz was elected chairman of the Leicester East constituency Labour Party (CLP) in January 2020.

In 2020, he said of a petition entitled &quot;Remove the Gandhi statue in Leicester&quot;, which alleged that Mahatma Gandhi was a &quot;fascist, racist and sexual predator&quot;, &quot;This is a dreadful petition that seeks to divide communities in Leicester and in the country. If this is not withdrawn I will certainly refer it to the police to consider whether it incites racial hatred.&quot;

Vaz is the founder of Silver Star Diabetes a Leicester based charity which promotes diabetes

In October 2023, it was reported by &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he was considering running for Leicester East after being encouraged by allies.

<text>Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral, with the formula Cu2CO3(OH)2. This opaque, green-banded mineral crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, and most often forms botryoidal, fibrous, or stalagmitic masses, in fractures and deep, underground spaces, where the water table and hydrothermal fluids provide the means for chemical precipitation. Individual crystals are rare, but occur as slender to acicular prisms. Pseudomorphs after more tabular or blocky azurite crystals also occur.

==Etymology and history==

The stone&#x27;s name derives (via , , and Middle English &quot;melochites&quot;) from Greek Μολοχίτης λίθος &quot;molochites lithos&quot;, &quot;mallow-green stone&quot;, from μολόχη &quot;molochē&quot;, variant of μαλάχη &quot;malāchē&quot;, &quot;mallow&quot;. The mineral was given this name due to its resemblance to the leaves of the mallow plant. Copper (Cu2+) gives malachite its green color.

Malachite was mined from deposits near the Isthmus of Suez and the Sinai as early as 4000 BCE.

It was extensively mined at the Great Orme Mines in Britain 3,800 years ago, using stone and bone tools. Archaeological evidence indicates that mining activity ended , with up to 1,760 tonnes of copper being produced from the mined malachite.

Archaeological evidence indicates that the mineral has been mined and smelted to obtain copper at Timna Valley in Israel for more than 3,000 years. Since then, malachite has been used as both an ornamental stone and as a gemstone.

The use of azurite and malachite as copper ore indicators led indirectly to the name of the element nickel in the English language. Nickeline, a principal ore of nickel that is also known as niccolite, weathers at the surface into a green mineral (annabergite) that resembles malachite. This resemblance resulted in occasional attempts to smelt nickeline in the belief that it was copper ore, but such attempts always ended in failure due to high smelting temperatures needed to reduce nickel. In Germany this deceptive mineral came to be known as &quot;kupfernickel&quot;, literally &quot;copper demon.&quot; The Swedish alchemist Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (who had been trained by Georg Brandt, the discoverer of the nickel-like metal cobalt) realized that there was probably a new metal hiding within the kupfernickel ore, and in 1751 he succeeded in smelting kupfernickel to produce a previously unknown (except in certain meteorites) silvery white, iron-like metal. Logically, Cronstedt named his new metal after the &quot;nickel&quot; part of &quot;kupfernickel&quot;.

==Occurrence==

Malachite often results from the supergene weathering and oxidation of primary sulfidic copper ores, and is often found with azurite (Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2), goethite, and calcite. Except for its vibrant green color, the properties of malachite are similar to those of azurite and aggregates of the two minerals occur frequently. Malachite is more common than azurite and is typically associated with copper deposits around limestones, the source of the carbonate.

Large quantities of malachite have been mined in the Urals, Russia. Ural malachite is not being mined , but G.N Vertushkova reports the possible discovery of new deposits of malachite in the Urals. It is found worldwide including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Gabon; Zambia; Tsumeb, Namibia; Mexico; Broken Hill, New South Wales; Burra, South Australia; Lyon, France; Timna Valley, Israel; and the Southwestern United States, most notably in Arizona.

Anthropogenic malachite was historically believed to be the primary component of the patina which forms on copper and copper alloy structures exposed to open-air weathering; however, atmospheric sources of sulfate and chloride (such as air pollution or sea winds) typically favour the formation of brochantite or atacamite. Malachite can also be produced synthetically, in which case it is referred to as basic copper carbonate or green verditer.

==Structure==
Malachite crystallizes in the monoclinic system. The structure consists of chains of alternating Cu2+ ions and OH− ions, with a net positive charge, woven between isolated triangular CO32− ions. Thus each copper ion is conjugated to two hydroxyl ions and two carbonate ions; each hydroxyl ion is conjugated with two copper ions; and each carbonate ion is conjugated with six copper ions.

==Use==
Malachite was used as a mineral pigment in green paints from antiquity until 1800. The pigment is moderately lightfast, sensitive to acids, and varying in color. This natural form of green pigment has been replaced by its synthetic form, verditer, among other synthetic greens.

Malachite is also used for decorative purposes, such as in wands and the Malachite Room in the Hermitage Museum, which features a huge malachite vase, and the Malachite Room in Castillo de Chapultepec in Mexico City. Another example is the Demidov Vase, part of the former Demidov family collection, and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. &quot;The Tazza&quot;, a large malachite vase, one of the largest pieces of malachite in North America and a gift from Tsar Nicholas II, stands as the focal point in the centre of the room of Linda Hall Library. In the time of Tsar Nicolas I decorative pieces with malachite were among the most popular diplomatic gifts. It was used in China as far back as the Eastern Zhou period. The base of FIFA World Cup Trophy has two layers of malachite.

===Symbolism and superstitions===
A 17th-century Spanish superstition held that having a child wear a lozenge of malachite would help them sleep, and keep evil spirits at bay. Marbodus recommended malachite as a talisman for young people because of its protective qualities and its ability to help with sleep. It has also historically been worn for protection from lightning and contagious diseases and for health, success, and constancy in the affections. During the Middle Ages it was customary to wear it engraved with a figure or symbol of the Sun to maintain health and to avert depression to which Capricorns were considered vulnerable.

In ancient Egypt the colour green (wadj) was associated with death and the power of resurrection as well as new life and fertility. Ancient Egyptians believed that the afterlife contained an eternal paradise, referred to as the &quot;Field of Malachite&quot;, which resembled their lives but with no pain or suffering.

===Ore uses===

Simple methods of copper ore extraction from malachite involved thermodynamic processes such as smelting. This reaction involves the addition of heat and a carbon, causing the carbonate to decompose leaving copper oxide and an additional carbon source such as coal converts the copper oxide into copper metal.

The basic word equation for this reaction is:

Copper carbonate + heat → carbon dioxide + copper oxide (color changes from green to black).

Copper oxide + carbon → carbon dioxide + copper (color change from black to copper colored).

Malachite is a low grade copper ore, however, due to increase demand for metals, more economic processing such as hydrometallurgical methods (using aqueous solutions such as sulfuric acid) are being used as malachite is readily soluble in dilute acids. Sulfuric acid is the most common leaching agent for copper oxide ores like malachite and eliminates the need for smelting processes.

The chemical equation for sulfuric acid leaching of copper ore from malachite is as follows:

==Health and environmental concerns==
Mining for malachite for ornamental or copper ore purposes involves open-pit mining or underground mining depending on the grade of the ore deposits. Open-pit and underground mining practices can cause environmental degradation through habitat and biodiversity loss. Acid mine drainage can contaminate water and food sources to negatively impact human health if improperly managed or if leaks from tailing ponds occur. The risk of health and environmental impacts of both traditional metallurgy and newer methods of hydrometallurgy are both significant, however, water conservation and waste management practices for hydrometallurgy processes for ore extraction, such as for malachite, are stricter and relatively more sustainable. New research is also being conducted on better alternatives to methods such as sulfuric acid leaching which has high environmental impacts, even under hydrometallurgy regulation standards and innovation.

<text>Bergisch Gladbach () is a city in the Cologne/Bonn Region of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, and capital of the Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis (district).

==Geography==
Bergisch Gladbach is east of the Rhine and about 10 km east of Cologne.

==City structure==
The urban area of Bergisch Gladbach is not divided into city districts (&quot;Stadtbezirke&quot;) with their own district representation. For statistical purposes, there are six statistical districts (&quot;statistische Bezirke&quot;), which are numbered consecutively and are divided into several districts (&quot;:de: Stadtteile&quot;) with their own names. These are mainly name of former smaller settlements from which today&#x27;s urban area developed, or new development areas whose names have been memorized over time for better orientation. Bensberg was an independent town until 1975. Before 1975, Schildgen belonged to the municipality of Odenthal.

*Statistical District 1: Schildgen (11), Katterbach (12), Nussbaum (13), Paffrath (14), Hand (15)
*Statistical District 2: City Center (21), Hebborn (22), Heidkamp (23), Gronau (24)
*Statistical District 3: Romaney (31), Herrenstrunden (32), Sand (33)
*Statistical District 4: Herkenrath (41), Asselborn (42), Bärbroich (43)
*Statistical District 5: Lückerath (51), Bensberg (52), Bockenberg (53), Kaule (54), Moitzfeld (55)
*Statistical District 6: Refrath (61), Alt Refrath (62), Kippekausen (63), Frankenforst (64), Lustheide (65)

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Beginning in the north, the neighbouring municipalities and neighbouring towns are clockwise Odenthal, Kürten, Overath, Rösrath, Cologne and Leverkusen.

==History==
Early settlements existed in the 13th century, but the town was officially founded only in 1856.
The word &quot;Bergisch&quot; in the name does not originate from its location in the county of Berg, and it was not added to distinguish it from Mönchengladbach, as is believed by many people, but from the counts who gave their name to the region.

In the early 12th century, the counts of Berg settled in the area, which later became the Duchy of Berg (under Napoleon, it became a grand duchy). That is where the first part of the name (&quot;Bergisch&quot;) comes from, the town being located in the former County of Berg. The town is the administrative headquarters (&quot;Kreisstadt&quot;) of the Rheinish-Bergisch district (&quot;Kreis&quot;).

The second part of the name, &quot;Gladbach&quot;, originates from Low Rhenish (&quot;Bergisches Platt&quot;) and means &quot;canalised stream&quot; in reference to the small river (the &quot;Strunde&quot;) that was artificially canalised in early medieval times. In &quot;Bergisch Platt&quot;, the regional dialect, &quot;gelaat&quot; (laid) eventually evolved to &quot;glad&quot; (the &#x27;d&#x27; is often pronounced as a &#x27;t&#x27;). The second part of the word, &quot;Bach&quot;, is the Standard German word for a small stream and refers to the &quot;Strunde&quot;.

In 1975, the town incorporated the neighbouring Bensberg, and when it reached a population of 100,000 in 1977 it was given city status.

==Economy==
Paper manufacturing, printing, glass wool manufacturing, chocolate and high-tech industries are a large part of Bergisch Gladbach&#x27;s economy.

==Politics==
===Mayor===
The current mayor of Bergisch Gladbach is Frank Stein of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

<text>The University of Leicester ( ) is a public research university based in Leicester, England. The main campus is south of the city centre, adjacent to Victoria Park. The university&#x27;s predecessor, University College, Leicester, gained university status in 1957.

The university had an income of £384.6 million in 2023/24, of which £74.5 million was from research grants.

The university is known for the invention of genetic fingerprinting, and for partially funding the discovery and the DNA identification of the remains of King Richard III in Leicester.

== History ==
===Desire for a university===
The first serious suggestions for a university in Leicester began with the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society (founded at a time when &quot;philosophical&quot; broadly meant what &quot;scientific&quot; means today). With the success of Owens College in Manchester, and the establishment of the University of Birmingham in 1900, and then of Nottingham University College, it was thought that Leicester ought to have a university college too. From the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century university colleges could not award degrees and had to be associated with universities that had degree-giving powers. Most students at university colleges took examinations set by the University of London.

In the late 19th century the co-presidents of the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society, the Revered James Went, headmaster of the Wyggeston Boys&#x27; School, and J. D. Paul, regularly called for the establishment of a university college However, no private donations were forthcoming, and the Corporation of Leicester was busy funding the School of Art and the Technical School. The matter was brought up again by Dr Astley V. Clarke (1870–1945) in 1912. Born in Leicester in 1870, he had been educated at Wyggeston Grammar School and the University of Cambridge before receiving medical training at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. He was the new president of the Literary and Philosophy society. Reaction was mixed, with some saying that Leicester&#x27;s relatively small population would mean a lack of demand. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, talk of a university college subsided. In 1917 the &quot;Leicester Daily Post&quot; urged in an editorial that something of more practical utility than memorials ought to be created to commemorate the war dead. With the ending of the war both the &quot;Post&quot; and its rival the &quot;Leicester Mail&quot; encouraged donations to form the university college. Some suggested that Leicester should join forces with Nottingham, Sutton Bonington and Loughborough to create a federal university college of the East Midlands, but nothing came of this proposal.

===Establishment===
The old asylum building had often been suggested as a site for the new university, and after it was due to be finished being used as a hospital for the wounded, Astley Clarke was keen to urge the citizens and local authorities to buy it. Fortunately, Clarke quickly learned the building had already been bought by Thomas Fielding Johnson, a wealthy philanthropist who owned a worsted manufacturing business. He had bought 37 acres of land for £40,000 and intended not only to house the college, but also the boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; grammar schools. Further donations soon topped £100,000: many were given in memory of loved ones lost during the war, while others were for those who had taken part and survived. King George V gave his blessing to the scheme after a visit to the town in 1919.
Talk turned to the curriculum with many arguing that it should focus on Leicester&#x27;s chief industries hosiery, boots and shoes. Others had higher hopes than just technical training. The education acts of 1902 and 1918, which brought education to the masses was also thought to have increased the need for a college, not least to train the new teachers that were needed. Talk of a federal university soured and the decision was for Leicester to become a stand-alone college. In 1920, the college appointed its first official. W. G. Gibbs, a long-standing supporter of the college while editor of the &quot;Leicester Daily Post&quot;, was nominated as secretary. On 9 May 1921, Dr R. F. Rattray (1886–1967) was appointed principal, aged 35. Rattray was an impressive academic. Having gained a first class English degree at Glasgow, he studied at Manchester College, Oxford. He then studied in Germany, and secured his PhD at Harvard. After that, he worked as a Unitarian minister. Rattray was to teach Latin and English. He recruited others including Miss Measham to teach botany, Miss Sarson to teach geography, and Miss Chapuzet to teach French. In all, 14 people started at the university when it opened its doors in October 1921: the principal, the secretary, three lecturers and nine students (eight women and one man). Two types of students were expected, around 100–150 teachers in training, and undergraduates hoping to sit the external degrees of London University. A students union was formed in 1923–24 with a Miss Bonsor as its first president.

In 1927, after it became University College, Leicester, students sat for the examinations for external degrees of the University of London. Two years later, it merged with the Vaughan Working Men&#x27;s College, which had been providing adult education in Leicester since 1862. In 1931, Dr Rattray resigned as principal. He was replaced in 1932 by Frederick Attenborough, who was the father of David and Richard Attenborough. He was succeeded by Charles Wilson in 1952.

===University status to modern day===

In 1957, the University College was granted its royal charter, and has since then had the status of a university with the right to award its own degrees. The Percy Gee Student Union building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 9 May 1958.

Leicester University won the first ever series of &quot;University Challenge&quot;, in 1963. The university&#x27;s motto &quot;Ut Vitam Habeant&quot; –&quot;so that they may have life&quot;, is a reflection of the war memorial origins of its formation. It is believed to have been Rattray&#x27;s suggestion.

The university medical school, Leicester Medical School, opened in 1971.

In 1994, the University of Leicester celebrated winning the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for its work in Physics &amp; Astronomy. The prize citation reads: &quot;World-class teaching, research and consultancy programme in astronomy and space and planetary science fields. Practical results from advanced thinking&quot;.

In 2011, the university was selected as one of four sites for national high performance computing (HPC) facilities for theoretical astrophysics and particle physics. An investment of £12.32 million, from the Government&#x27;s Large Facilities Capital Fund, together with investment from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and from universities contribute to a national supercomputer.

In September 2012, a ULAS team exhumed the body of King Richard III, discovering it in the former Greyfriars Friary Church in the city of Leicester. As a result of that success Prof King was asked to investigate whether a skeleton found in Jamestown was that of George Yeardley, the 1st colonial governor of Virginia and founder of the Virginia General Assembly.

In January 2017, Physics students from the University of Leicester made national news when they revealed their predictions on how long it would take a zombie apocalypse to wipe out humanity. They calculated that it would take just 100 days for zombies to completely take over earth. At the end of the 100 days, the students predicted that just 300 humans would remain alive and without infection.

In January 2021, around 200 UCU members at the university passed a no-confidence motion in Vice Chancellor Nishan Canagarajah because of proposed cuts putting 145 staff members at risk of redundancy. There was anger at his claim that redundancies are needed to &quot;continue to deliver excellence&quot;. In April, the UCU urged academics to boycott the university due to the planned redundancies, including encouraging people to not apply for jobs at Leicester or collaborate on new research projects.

==Campus==

The main campus is a mile south of the city centre, adjacent to Victoria Park and Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College. The skyline of the university is punctuated by three distinctive, towering, buildings from the 1960s: the Department of Engineering, the Attenborough Tower and the Charles Wilson Building.

===Fielding Johnson Building===
The Fielding Johnson Building was designed by William Parsons in a late Georgian provincial style as the Leicestershire and Rutland County Asylum. From 1921 the building was home to most of the university departments until purpose-built accommodation was created, and it was renamed the Fielding Johnson Building in 1964. It now houses the university&#x27;s administration offices, Leicester Law School (including the original university library Harry Peach Law Library, the Legal Advice Clinic, moot court), and the university&#x27;s council chambers. The south wing of this building includes the university&#x27;s Accessibility service for disabled students and access to the Peter Williams lecture theatre and Ogden Lewis Seminar Suite in the lower storeys of the David Wilson main library building.

===Attenborough Tower===
The 18-storey Attenborough Tower is home to the College of Social Sciences and has undergone extensive renovation.

===Engineering Building===
The Engineering Building was the first major building by British architects James Stirling and James Gowan. This Grade II* listed building comprises workshops and laboratories at ground level, and a tower containing offices and lecture theatres.

===Other buildings===

Opposite the Fielding Johnson Building are the Astley Clarke Building, home to the School of Criminology and Sociology, and the Danielle Brown Sports Centre.

The Ken Edwards Building, built in 1995, lies adjacent to the Fielding Johnson Building and is home to part of the School of Computing and Mathematical Science, the School of Modern Languages and learning spaces shared by a variety of the university&#x27;s schools.

Built in 1957, the Percy Gee Building is home to Leicester University&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union. Percy Gee was one of the first treasurers of the University College.

The David Wilson Library was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 4 December 2008, following an extensive refurbishment with a budget of £32 million.

The Bennett Building, Physics and Astronomy Building, the Chemistry Building and the Adrian Building lie beyond the Charles Wilson Building. Across University Road, linked by pedestrian bridges, lie the Maurice Shock and Hodgkin Buildings. Further along University Road is the George Davies Centre building (built 2016), home to Leicester&#x27;s Medical School.

The Adrian Building was built in 1967 and designed by Courtald Technical Services which became W.F Johnson &amp; Partners. It was named after Edgar Adrian the first chancellor of the university (1957–1971).
The Charles Wilson Building was designed by Denys Lasdun and completed in 1967. It&#x27;s distinctive brutalist silhouette created by the additional upper storeys and related structures have led to it being likened to the Transformer Optimus Prime by local residents and alumni.

Along London road is the Brookfield campus home to the College of Business (previously known as the University of Leicester School of Business or ULSB) and the post-graduate centre. It was sympathetically renovated, with the original building being built in 1870 and was home to Thomas Fielding Johnson, the founder of the University of Leicester.

Further along University Road and on Salisbury Road and Regents Road is the School of Education.

On Lancaster Road there is the Attenborough Arts Centre, the university&#x27;s arts center.

Leicester&#x27;s halls of residence are noteworthy: many of the halls (nearly all located in Oadby) date from the early 1900s and were the homes of Leicester&#x27;s wealthy industrialists. Accommodation on campus is at Freemen&#x27;s Common and Nixon Court.

===Development===
In recent years, the university has disposed of some of its poorer quality property in order to invest in new facilities, and is currently undergoing a £300+ million redevelopment. The new John Foster Hall of Residence opened in October 2006. The David Wilson Library, twice the size of the previous University Library, opened on 1 April 2008 and a new biomedical research building (the Henry Wellcome Building) has already been constructed. A complete revamp of the Percy Gee Student Union building was completed in September 2010. Nixon Court was extended and refurbished in 2011. In the early 2020s the Freemen&#x27;s Common accommodation was demolished, replaced with new accommodation named known collectively as both Freemen&#x27;s Common and Freemen&#x27;s, a multi-storey carpark and the Sir Bob Burgess Building, a building with learning facilities and offices that is shared across multiple departments of the university.

==Organisation==
The university&#x27;s academic schools and departments are organised into colleges. In August 2015, the colleges were further restructured with the merging of &quot;Social Sciences&quot; and &quot;Arts, Humanities and Law&quot; to give the following structure:

===College of Life Sciences===
The college has the following academic schools:
* Leicester Medical School
* School of Biological Sciences
* School of Psychology
* School of Allied Health Professions

The research departments and institutes:
* Cardiovascular Sciences
* Genetics and Genome Biology (including the Leicester Cancer Research Centre)
* Health Sciences (including the Leicester Diabetes Centre)

Their father Frederick Attenborough was Principal of the University College from 1932 until 1951. The brothers were educated at the adjacent grammar school before attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the University of Cambridge respectively.

Both have maintained links with the university—David Attenborough was made an honorary Doctor of Letters in 1970 and opened the Attenborough Arboretum in Knighton in 1997. In the same year, the &quot;Richard Attenborough Centre for Disability and the Arts&quot; was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales. Both brothers were made Distinguished Honorary Fellows of the university at the degree ceremony in the afternoon of 13 July 2006.

<text>The Exhortation and Litany, published in 1544, is the earliest officially authorized vernacular service in English. The same rite survives, in modified form, in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

==Background==
Before the English Reformation, processions were important parts of worship on Sundays and holy days, such as Candlemas and Rogation days. The government also ordered processions in times of trouble and danger. The litany was a penitential processional service used in time of trouble or to express sorrow for sins. It consisted chiefly of very short intercessory petitions to God and the saints said by the priest and a brief standard response from the choir or congregation. The penitential psalms were also recited as time allowed. 

On 20 August 1543, Henry VIII had ordered &quot;general rogations and processions to be made&quot; on account of the multiple troubles England was experiencing, but public response was slack. This was attributed in part to the fact that the people did not understand what was being said and sung, since the litany was said in Latin. Therefore, an English version was composed by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, for use in the processions ordered by Henry when England was simultaneously at war with both Scotland and France.

==Content and use==
For the litany, Cranmer drew heavily on both traditional and recent sources ranging from John Chrysostom to Martin Luther, the bulk of the material coming from the Sarum Rite. Much of the work of synthesizing these sources was originally done by William Marshall in his Lutheran-oriented primer prayer book, the &quot;Goodly Primer&quot; of 1535. Cranmer also changed the rhythm of the service by grouping the intercessory phrases in blocks with but a single response to the group.

The litany was published in the midst of the English Reformation and shows clear signs of Protestant influence. Protestants disliked both the traditional litany&#x27;s veneration of saints as well as liturgical processions in general. In Cranmer&#x27;s litany, the invocation of saints was heavily reduced and only Mary, the mother of Jesus, was mentioned by name. In all, Cranmer&#x27;s revision reduced what had once been the major part of the litany into just three petitions: to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the angels, and all the saints. The penitential psalms that were traditionally said at the beginning were left out. The litany was prefaced with an &quot;Exhortation to Prayer&quot;, which was a homily-styled discourse on the nature of prayer. The &quot;Exhortation&quot; was intended to be read in public before the procession started.

Published on 27 May 1544, the litany was the first authorised English-language service. It was to be used for Rogation and Lenten processions. Cranmer also produced an English translation of the &quot;Processionale&quot;, the Latin service-book containing other processional services for Sundays and saints days; however, this project was abandoned. In October 1545, the &quot;Processionale&quot; was completely replaced by the new English litany. This was an important change because it meant that the somber, penitential litany would now be said on joyful feast days. In August 1547, after Edward VI had become king, processions were prohibited completely. The litany was thereafter sung while kneeling in church.

== Book of Common Prayer ==
Cranmer&#x27;s litany was included in the first &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; published in 1549. It was also included in the 1552 prayer book and the 1559 prayer book. One part of the litany has the people pray for deliverance &quot;from the tyranny of the bishop of Rome and all his detestable enormities.&quot; In the 1559 prayer book, this invocation against the Pope was deleted.

<text>Bruno Frank (June 13, 1887 – June 20, 1945) was a German author, poet, playwright, screenwriter, and humanist.

==Biography==

Frank was born in Stuttgart. He studied law and philosophy in Munich, where he later worked as a dramatist and novelist until the Reichstag fire in 1933. Persecuted by the government because of his Jewish heritage, he left Nazi Germany with his wife, Liesl, daughter of famed Jewish operetta diva Fritzi Massary and Count Karl Coudenhove. They lived for four years in Austria and England, before emigrating in 1937 to the United States, where he was reunited with his friends Heinrich Mann and Thomas Mann. Frank is considered part of the group of anti-Nazi writers whose works constitute German Exilliteratur. He continued to write, producing two novels, and worked in the film industry for the rest of his life.

Frank wrote the screenplay for the popular movie version of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939 film), directed by William Dieterle and starring Charles Laughton, based on the novel by Victor Hugo. Frank&#x27;s play, &quot;Sturm im Wasserglas&quot;, was filmed in Great Britain, in 1937, as Storm in a Teacup, and posthumously made into a movie directed by Josef von Báky in 1960.

His nephew Anthony M. Frank became United States Postmaster General in 1988.

Frank died of a heart attack in Beverly Hills. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>Red Heat is a 1988 American buddy cop action comedy film directed, co-written, and co-produced by Walter Hill and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Soviet policeman Ivan Danko, and Jim Belushi as Chicago police detective Art Ridzik. Finding themselves on the same case, Danko and Ridzik work as partners to catch a cunning and deadly Georgian drug kingpin, Viktor Rostavili (Ed O&#x27;Ross), who killed Danko&#x27;s previous partner. Most of the scenes set in the Soviet Union were actually shot in Hungary. Schwarzenegger was paid $8 million for his role in the film.

==Plot==
Moscow City Police officers Ivan Danko and Yuri Ogarkov lead a sting operation against Georgian mafia kingpin Viktor Rostavili. However, Rostavili manages to evade capture, and in an ensuing firefight kills Ogarkov before fleeing to the United States. As Danko is recovering from his injuries, Rostavili is arrested for a minor traffic violation in Chicago, and Danko is subsequently dispatched to America to retrieve the felon, under strict orders not to reveal the true nature of Rostavili&#x27;s extradition.

Upon arriving in Chicago, Danko is met by Chicago Police Department detectives Art Ridzik and Max Gallagher. As he is interrogating Rostavili, Danko confiscates a mysterious key from him. While Rostavili is being transported to the airport, the group is ambushed by his men and Gallagher is shot and killed, allowing Rostavili to escape. Against the wishes of the American authorities, Danko remains in Chicago to apprehend Rostavili, and Ridzik is assigned to be his minder. Through an informant, Danko and Ridzik learn that Rostavili is working with local street gangs to purchase and smuggle cocaine into the Soviet Union. The duo confront Rostavili&#x27;s American wife Cat Manzetti, but are led into an ambush where Rostavili demands Danko return his key, forcing the two to flee.

Danko and Ridzik go to a hospital to interrogate one of Rostavili&#x27;s men who was injured during the earlier ambush, but he is killed by another of Rostavili&#x27;s accomplices disguised as a nurse. Danko subsequently shoots and kills the assassin. Ridzik&#x27;s superiors confiscate Danko&#x27;s gun, as he is not licensed to carry one in the United States, and order him to cease the investigation. However Ridzik, who still wants to avenge his partner&#x27;s murder, secretly gives Danko his spare gun. Cat is then murdered by Rostavili.

Returning to his hotel, Danko is attacked by Rostavili&#x27;s men. While Danko fights them off, Rostavili sneaks into his room and steals the key. Ridzik takes Danko to visit a locksmith, where they match the key to ones produced for lockers at a bus terminal. Rostavili uses the key to retrieve his drug shipment, and steals an empty bus just as Danko and Ridzik arrive. Chasing him in another bus, Danko and Ridzik cause Rostavili to crash into an oncoming train. As Rostavili crawls out of the wreckage, Danko kills him. Later, Ridzik takes Danko to the airport. As a token of their new friendship, they exchange wristwatches. Danko tells Ridzik they are policemen, not politicians, so it is okay for them to like each other. The scene closes with Danko saluting while in Red Square in Moscow.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
The film was based on an original story by Walter Hill. He says he conceived of the idea for &quot;Red Heat&quot; because he and Arnold Schwarzenegger had long wanted to work together:
I didn&#x27;t want to do sci-fi and it&#x27;s tough to use Arnold credibly in an American context with his accent. I thought it would be interesting if he could play a Russian cop in the US. I wanted to do a traditional John Wayne/Clint Eastwood larger-than-life movie. You then ask the question: Will the American audience accept an unapologetic Soviet hero, someone who will not defect at the end of the movie?
According to Schwarzenegger, when Hill approached him he did not have a complete script – he just had the basic premise and the scene in which Danko rips off a henchman&#x27;s leg to discover it is wooden and contains cocaine. Schwarzenegger agreed to make the movie on the basis of this and Hill&#x27;s track record, in particular his earlier buddy action comedy &quot;48 Hours&quot;.

The wooden leg scene originally came from a script by Harry Kleiner that had been sent to Hill. Hill did not want to do the script but loved the scene and paid Kleiner for it. &quot;I think it&#x27;s the best scene in the movie&quot;, said Hill later. &quot;The movie, after he left Moscow, I never thought was much good, but I thought that was a terrific scene.&quot;

Hill says he deliberately chose to tone down the Schwarzenegger persona, making him more realistic and less prone to wisecracks. Hill:
I had confidence in him as an actor. I didn&#x27;t want him just to throw a Volkswagen over a building. Arnold has an ability to communicate that cuts through cultures and countries. They just love to see this guy win. But everyone thinks it&#x27;s his muscles. It&#x27;s not that at all: it&#x27;s his face, his eyes. He has a face that&#x27;s a throwback to a warrior from the Middle Ages or ancient Greece.
Schwarzenegger says Hill told him to watch Greta Garbo&#x27;s performance in &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939) &quot;to get a handle on how Danko [his character] should react as a loyal Soviet in the West. I got to learn a little Russian, and it was a role for which my own accent was a plus.&quot;

The music score was done by James Horner. &quot;I told James I wanted something like you&#x27;re in the Olympics and you&#x27;ve just won a gold medal&quot;, said Hill. &quot;I wanted something heroic.&quot; The second movement (&quot;Philosophers&quot;) of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution&quot; was used in the opening and closing titles of the film.

Hill says he wanted to use buses rather than cars in the climactic action scene because it would be more interesting. &quot;Also, I thought it was very appropriate for Arnold. He doesn&#x27;t fit well in cars.&quot;

He described the film as &quot;in an odd way, it&#x27;s a traditional love story between these two guys&quot;.
The script was constantly rewritten during the shoot. Among the writers who worked on it were Hill himself, Harry Kleiner, Troy Kennedy Martin, Steven Meerson &amp; Peter Krikes, and John Mankiewicz &amp; Daniel Pyne. &quot;You&#x27;ve got to understand that Walter likes to create as he goes along&quot;, said a source close to the production. &quot;Also, the project was put together quickly based on an idea of his--a Russian cop in Chicago. There was no script.&quot; A spokesman for the Writers Guild said Hill was a member in very good standing: &quot;He does tend to hire a lot of people but he pays well above minimums and we feel he&#x27;s been quite straightforward about screen credit.&quot;

Film title designer Wayne Fitzgerald created a new typeface for the film, a morph of English and Russian alphabets. For example, he removed the bar in &quot;A&quot; so that it imitates the Russian Л (Λ), and flipped letters N and R, so that they coincide with Russian И and Я, respectively.

===Filming===
The first half of the opening scene was shot in Budapest&#x27;s Rudas Thermal Bath. It features a brawl between naked men, including Schwarzenegger. He approved the scene saying that &quot;Whenever the scene calls for nudity and it fits into the movie, I don&#x27;t mind that. But if it is exploiting the whole idea and is thrown in for no reason, then it bothers me and I stay away from it.&quot;

The second half was shot in Austria because Budapest had no snow. The film shot in Moscow for four days, primarily at Red Square, which became possible due to the rapid warm up of the cultural and political relations between the Soviet Union and United States. Despite obtaining permission to film in Moscow, the film crew was unsure about exactly where they could shoot; hence many &quot;Moscow&quot; scenes were eventually filmed in Budapest. For example, Buda Castle was used as the Soviet Ministry of home affairs.

===Weapons===
In the film, Danko is using &quot;the best Soviet gun of 9.2 mm caliber designed by Podbyrin&quot;. Hill wanted it to be an unusually large and threatening weapon resembling the Walther P38. Tim LaFrance designed the gun at his workshop in San Diego, starting from Desert Eagle as an inspiration; hence the gun was nicknamed the &quot;Hollywood Eagle&quot;. After release of the movie, its copies were sold in the United States as &quot;Pobyrin pistol&quot;.

As to the weapon of the main villain, Viktor Rostavili, Hill wanted it to be a concealed, mafia-style gun. LaFrance designed it as a modified derringer, which was strapped to a forearm using a spring-based system. The gun was hidden in a sleeve, and slid into the hand after a certain hand movement.

== Music ==
The &quot;Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution&quot; movement &quot;The Philosophers&quot; was used in the opening and closing titles of the film. The soundtrack for &quot;Red Heat&quot; is known for Horner reusing motifs from his soundtrack for &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; (which would be again recycled to varying degrees in &quot;Commando&quot; and &quot;Another 48 Hrs.&quot;). James Horner is infamous for recycling major elements and motifs of previous works as well as those of other composers.

==Release==
&quot;Red Heat&quot; opened in Los Angeles and New York on June 17, 1988. It was distributed by TriStar Pictures.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at the top spot at the box office, it grossed $35 million in the US, but was far outpaced by Schwarzenegger&#x27;s other comedy film in 1988, &quot;Twins&quot;.

Schwarzenegger later wrote the film &quot;wasn&#x27;t the smash I&#x27;d expected. Why is hard to guess. It could be that audiences were not ready for Russia, or that my and Jim Belushi&#x27;s performances were not funny enough, or that the director didn&#x27;t do a good enough job. For whatever reason, it just didn&#x27;t quite close the deal.&quot;

Walter Hill said the film &quot;did pretty well at the domestic box office but not as well as what we hoped it would do. It was big foreign. It was a very big seller on cassette. Did the movie do poorly, medium or well?&quot;

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 67% based on reviews from 27 critics, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Red Heat&quot;&#x27;s overreliance on genre formula is bolstered by Walter Hill&#x27;s rugged direction and a strong touch of humor.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 61% based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 3 out of 4, and wrote: &quot;The film is punctuated by violence, a great deal of violence, although most of it is exaggerated comic-book style instead of being truly gruesome. Walking that fine line is a speciality of Hill.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; gave it a positive review, stating &quot;Schwarzenegger [...] is right on target with his characterization of the iron-willed soldier, and Belushi proves a quicksilver foil.

Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; panned the film: &quot;&quot;Red Heat&quot; is poorly, or even indifferently, made. It&#x27;s a joyless exercise, and too much angry resignation seeps in for it to be very funny or very entertaining.&quot; Film historian Leonard Maltin seemed to agree with Hinson, calling the film &quot;...cheerless and foul-mouthed, with two of the least-appealing characters imaginable as the good guys.&quot;

==Video game==

A video game based on the film was released in 1989, for various computer platforms.

<text>Lutjegast () is a village in the municipality of Westerkwartier in Groningen, Netherlands. It had a population of around 1,125 in January 2017.

==History==
The name &quot;Lutjegast&quot; originates from Gronings in which &quot;lutje&quot; means small or little and a &quot;ga(a)st&quot; is a higher, sandy ridge in an otherwise swampy area. The village was first mentioned in 1459 as &quot;op de Lutkegast&quot;. Lutjegast is a road village which developed on a sandy ridge.

The Dutch Reformed church was built in 1877 and was restored in 1922. The Reformed Church is a cruciform church built in 1922 without a tower in expressionist style.

Lutjegast was the birthplace of the explorer Abel Tasman. He is memorialised in town by a monument, plaque and street name. In 2014, a museum dedicated to Abel Tasman opened in the village house.

Until 1828, a manor house named &quot;Rikkerdaborg&quot; stood in Lutjegast. Its most famous occupant was Bernard Johan Prott who was the commander of Bourtange in 1672. Christoph Bernhard von Galen, the Prince-bishop of Münster had allegedly offered Prott ƒ200,000.- to take Bourtange, however Prott refused the offer and von Galen was unable to take the fortress by force.

Lutjegast was home to 294 people in 1840. The village used to be part of the municipality of Grootegast. In 2019, it was merged into Westerkwartier.

== Notable people ==
* Abel Tasman (ca.1603–1659), explorer, first European to discover Tasmania.
* Arjen Lubach (born 1979), comedian, author, music producer and TV presenter.
* Klaasje Meijer (born 1995), singer, actress and flautist

Batavia can refer to the city proper or its suburbs and hinterland, the , which included the much larger area of the Residency of Batavia in the present-day Indonesian provinces of Jakarta, Banten and West Java.

The founding of Batavia by the Dutch in 1619, on the site of the ruins of Jayakarta, led to the establishment of a Dutch colony; Batavia became the center of the Dutch East India Company&#x27;s trading network in Asia. Monopolies on local produce were augmented by non-indigenous cash crops. To safeguard their commercial interests, the company and the colonial administration absorbed surrounding territory.

Batavia is on the north coast of Java, in a sheltered bay, on a land of marshland and hills crisscrossed with canals. The city had two centers: Oud Batavia (the oldest part of the city) and Weltevreden (the relatively newer city), on higher ground to the south.

It was a European colonial city for about 320 years until 1942, when the Dutch East Indies was occupied by Japan during World War II. During the Japanese occupation and after Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945, the city was known as Jakarta. It remained internationally known by its Dutch name until Indonesia achieved full independence in 1949, when the city was renamed Jakarta.

==Dutch East India Company (1610–1799)==
===Arrival===

Amsterdam merchants embarked on an expedition to the East Indies archipelago in 1595 under the command of Cornelis de Houtman. The English East India Company&#x27;s first voyage in 1602, commanded by James Lancaster, arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Bantam. There, Lancaster was allowed to build a trading post which was the center of English trade in the East Indies archipelago until 1682.

The Dutch government granted the Dutch East India Company (VOC) a monopoly on Asian trade in 1602. A year later, the first permanent Dutch trading post in the East Indies archipelago was established in Bantam, West Java. Prince Jayawikarta gave Dutch merchants permission to build a wooden warehouse and houses on the east bank of the Ciliwung river opposite Jayakarta in 1610, and the outpost was established the following year. As Dutch power increased, Jayawikarta allowed the English to build houses on the west bank of the Ciliwung and a fort near his customs office to maintain a balance of power.

Tensions between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch escalated until 1618, when Jayawikarta&#x27;s soldiers besieged the Dutch fortress containing the Nassau and Mauritius warehouse. An English fleet of 15 ships arrived under Thomas Dale, former governor of the colony of Virginia. After a sea battle, newly appointed Dutch governor Jan Pieterszoon Coen escaped to the Moluccas to seek support; the Dutch had taken over the first of the Portuguese forts there in 1605. Dutch garrison commander Pieter van den Broecke and five other men were arrested during negotiations, since Jayawikarta believed that he had been deceived by the Dutch. Jayawikarta and the English then forged an alliance.

The Dutch army was on the verge of surrendering to the English when, in 1619, the Sultanate of Banten sent a group of soldiers to summon Jayawikarta. Jayawikarta&#x27;s agreement with the English had not been approved by the Bantenese authorities. The conflict between Banten and Jayawikarta and the tense relationship between Banten and the English provided a new opportunity for the Dutch. Coen returned from the Moluccas with reinforcements on 28 May 1619, razing Jayakarta to the ground two days later and expelling its population. Only the Luso-Sundanese padrão remained.

Jayawikarta retreated to Tanara, in the interior of Banten, where he later died. The Dutch established a closer relationship with Banten and assumed control of the port, which became the regional Dutch center of power.

===Founding===
The region which became Batavia came under Dutch control in 1619, initially as an expansion of the original Dutch fort and a new building on the ruins of the former Jayakarta. Coen decided to expand the original fort into a larger fortress on 2 July 1619, and sent plans for Batavia Castle to the Netherlands on 7 October of that year. The castle was larger than the previous one, with two northern bastions protecting it from a maritime attack. The Nassau and Mauritius warehouses were expanded with the erection of an eastern fort extension, overseen by Commander Van Raay, on 12 March 1619.

Although Coen wanted to name the new settlement Nieuw-Hoorn after Hoorn (his birthplace), he was prevented from doing so by the board of the VOC. Batavia was chosen as the new name of the fort and settlement, and a naming ceremony was held on 18 January 1621. It was named after the Batavi Germanic tribe, which inhabited the Batavian region during the Roman Empire; at the time, it was believed that the tribe was the ancestors of the Dutch people. Jayakarta was called Batavia for over 300 years.

There were three governmental administrations in the Batavia region. Initial authority was established in 1609 and became the colonial &quot;High Government&quot;, consisting of the Governor-General and the Council of the Indies. The urban (or civil) administration of the city of Batavia was established in 1620. On 24 June 1620, two company officials and three free citizens (or burghers) were appointed to the first College of Aldermen. The local rural administration, formed in 1664, became fully functional in 1682. The Javanese people were prohibited from settling in Batavia from the time of its founding in 1619.

===Expansion===

From its founding, Batavia was planned in a well-defined layout. Three trenches were dug east of the Ciliwung River in 1619, its first Dutch-made canals. The canals were named (from south to north) Leeuwengracht, Groenegracht, and Steenhouwersgracht. The castle area begins in a former field north of Steenhouwersgracht, in which a town market was established. The first church and town hall were built c. 1622 on the east bank of the river; Batavia&#x27;s first combined church and town hall (replaced during the 1630s) was at .
Around 1627, the three canals were connected with the Tijgersgracht canal. The new canal was lined with coconut trees; according to a contemporary observer, &quot;Among the Grachts, the Tygersgracht is the most stately and most pleasant, both for the goodliness of its buildings, and the ornamentation of its streets, which afford a very agreeable shadow to those who pass along the street&quot;. The Prinsestraat, originally the street leading to the castle, became an urban center connecting the castle&#x27;s south gate with the city hall.

Eastern Batavia was protected by a long canal which linked the castle moat and the Ciliwung riverbend, and ran at a slight angle to Tijgersgracht. The canal cost over 160,000 real, which was paid mostly by the Chinese instead of the company (who had strengthened the castle with slave and prison labor). The short-lived outer canal was redesigned several years after the 1628–1629 siege of Batavia.
Sultan Agung (king of the Mataram Sultanate) gained control of most of Java by defeating Surabaya in 1625. On 27 August 1628, Agung began the siege of Batavia. After heavy losses in his first attempt, he retreated and launched a second offensive the following year. This also failed; the Dutch fleet destroyed his supplies and ships in the harbors of Cirebon and Tegal. Mataram troops, starving and decimated by illness, retreated again. Agung then moved east, attacking Blitar, Panarukan and the Blambangan Kingdom in eastern Java (a vassal state of the Balinese kingdom of Gelgel).

After the siege, it was decided that Batavia needed a stronger defense system. Based on the work of Flemish mathematician and military engineer Simon Stevin, Governor-General Jacques Specx designed a moat and city wall; extensions of the wall were built west of Batavia, and the city was completely enclosed.

In 1656, due to a conflict with Banten, the Javanese were not allowed to live within the city walls and settled outside Batavia. The Chinese and the Mardijkers were the only non-Dutch settlers within the walled city. A 1659 truce with Banten enabled the city to grow, and more bamboo houses were built. Bamboo houses and livestock were banned in 1667, and the wealthy Dutch built tall houses and canals.

===The region===
The region was an important source of food crops and building materials. The VOC established a local government in 1664, which became fully functional in 1682. Chinese inhabitants began to cultivate sugarcane.

Large-scale cultivation negatively impacted the environment, and Batavia&#x27;s northern area experienced coastal erosion. The canals required extensive maintenance, with frequent closures for dredging. Residents of the Ommelanden lived in country houses or ethnic kampungs governed by a headman.

===1740 massacre and opening to trade===
Batavia&#x27;s sugar industry declined during the 1730s, with rising unemployment and social disorder. In 1739, there were 10,574 Chinese people living in the Ommelanden. Tensions grew as the colonial government attempted to restrict Chinese immigration with deportations to Ceylon and South Africa.

The Chinese, afraid that they would be thrown overboard to drown, rioted. Ten thousand Chinese were killed from 9 to 22 October 1740. The few surviving Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok, outside the city walls, the following year.

In 1789, the Americans visited and were permitted through formal applications to trade.

==Dutch East Indies (1800–1949)==

After the VOC went bankrupt and was dissolved in 1800, the Batavian Republic nationalized its debts and possessions and expanded its territorial claims into a colony known as the Dutch East Indies. Batavia evolved from a regional company headquarters into the colony&#x27;s capital.

===Southward expansion===
In 1808, Herman Willem Daendels decided to leave the dilapidated, unhealthy Old Town. A new town center was built further south, on the Weltevreden estate. Batavia became a city with two centers; Kota was the business hub with offices and warehouses of shipping and trading companies, and Weltevreden was home to the government, military, and shops. The centers were connected by the Molenvliet Canal and a road alongside the canal.

===British rule===
Under British rule, Daendels was replaced by Stamford Raffles. In 1811, Raffles—who was employed by the British East India Company as secretary to the governor of Malacca—decided to take over the government in Batavia. One reason was to prevent the French from stepping in completely, since Napoleon had nominated Daendels (who worked closely with the French).

In 1816, the Dutch returned to rule the region. Europeans were brought to the archipelago to establish a colony on vacant land, triggering wars in Java and Sumatra. Large numbers of troops were brought into the Dutch Indies to suppress unrest (particularly on Sumatra) and extend Dutch government influence beyond Java. However, the Dutch never conquered the entire archipelago.

The development of Weltevreden as the colony&#x27;s administrative center continued, gradually shifting the center of Batavia south from Oud Batavia. A new Indies Empire style of architecture emerged; white-plastered villas with a large front porch were built, especially around the Koningsplein and at Weltevreden. This newer part of Batavia generally had a more open look than Oud Batavia&#x27;s developed, canal cityscape.

===Technological advances===
Unlike the first half of the 19th century, the second half of the century was a peaceful period characterized by economic and technological expansion and a stable government. In 1856, the region&#x27;s first telegraph line was installed between Batavia and Buitenzorg. In 1859, Batavia was connected to Singapore with the Dutch East Indies&#x27; first international telegraph connection. The city completed its first gasworks two years later, and its streets were lit with gas by 1862. The first trams and telephones came in 1882.

Horse-drawn tram, introduced to Batavia in 1869, were upgraded to steam power in 1882 and electricity in 1900. The city&#x27;s first railway also began in 1869, and the line from Batavia to Buitenzorg was completed in 1873. 
The city&#x27;s first ice house was built in 1870.

The 1869 opening of the Suez Canal increased the need for a new port. The port of Tanjung Priok was completed in 1885, replacing the centuries-old, inadequate Sunda Kelapa, significantly increasing trade and tourism in Batavia and the Dutch East Indies.

===Abolition of Cultivation System===

The Cultivation System (&quot;cultuurstelsel&quot;) was a mid-19th-century Dutch government policy which required a portion of agricultural production to be export crops. Indonesian historians refer to it as &quot;tanam paksa&quot; (enforced planting).

The 1870 abolition of the Cultivation System led to the rapid development of private enterprise in the Dutch East Indies. A number of trading companies and financial institutions were established on Java, particularly in Batavia. The Old Town&#x27;s deteriorating structures were replaced with offices, usually along the Ciliwung River. Private companies owned (or managed) plantations, oil fields, and mines. The island&#x27;s first railway line opened in 1867, and railway stations were built in urban centers such as Batavia.

Schools, hospitals, factories, offices, trading companies, and post offices were established throughout the city. Improvements in Batavia&#x27;s transportation, health, and technology encouraged more Dutch people to move to the capital, and Batavian society became increasingly Dutch. The city traded with Europe, and increased shipping led to the construction of a new harbor at Tanjung Priok between 1877 and 1883.

Foreigners were known locally as totoks, distinguishing new Chinese arrivals from the peranakans. Many totoks adopted Indonesian culture, wearing kebayas, sarongs, and summer dresses.

By the end of the 19th century, Batavia&#x27;s population was 115,887 people; of these, 8,893 were Europeans, 26,817 were Chinese and 77,700 were indigenous islanders. The city&#x27;s expanding commercial activity led to the immigration of large numbers of Dutch employees and rural Javanese to Batavia. The 1905 population of Batavia and its surrounding area reached 2.1 million, including 93,000 Chinese people, 14,000 Europeans, and 2,800 Arabs. This growth resulted in an increased demand for housing, and land prices soared. New houses were built close together, and kampung settlements filled spaces between the houses. Settlements, built with little regard for the region&#x27;s tropical conditions, resulted in overcrowding, poor sanitation, and an absence of public amenities. Java had an outbreak of plague in 1913.

Old Batavia&#x27;s abandoned moats and ramparts experienced a boom during the period, as trading companies were established along the Ciliwung. The old city soon re-established itself as a commercial center, with 20th- and 17th-century buildings adjacent to one another.

===Dutch Ethical Policy===
The Dutch Ethical Policy was introduced in 1901, expanding educational opportunities for the indigenous population of the Dutch East Indies. In 1924, a law school was founded in Batavia. The city&#x27;s population in the 1930 census was 435,000.

The University of Batavia was established in 1941, and later became the University of Indonesia. In 1946, the Dutch colonial government established the Nood Universiteit (Emergency University) in Jakarta. The following year, its name was changed to Universiteit van Indonesië (UVI). After the Indonesian National Revolution the government established Universiteit Indonesia, a state university, in Jakarta in February 1950. Its name was later changed to Universitas Indonesia.

===Independence movement===

Volksraad member Mohammad Husni Thamrin criticized the colonial government for ignoring the kampungs and catering to the wealthy in Menteng. In 1909, Tirto Adhi Soerjo founded the Islamic Commercial Union in Batavia to support Indonesian merchants. Branches in other areas followed. In 1920, Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto and Agus Salim established a committee in Batavia to support the Ottoman Caliphate.

Spies warned the Dutch about a planned revolt in 1926, and Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) leaders were arrested. Andries Cornelis Dirk de Graeff replaced Dirk Fock as governor-general, and uprisings in Batavia, Banten, and Priangan were quickly crushed. Armed Communists occupied the Batavia telephone exchange for one night before they were captured. The Dutch sent prisoners to Banden and to a penal colony at Boven-Digoel in West New Guinea, where many died of malaria. Sukarno and the Study Club founded the Indonesian Nationalist Association (which became the Indonesian National Party and later joined the Partai Sarekat Islam, Budi Utomo, and the Surabaya Study Club to form the Union of Indonesian Political Associations) on 4 July 1927.

A youth congress was held in Batavia in October 1928, and the groups began referring to the city as Jakarta. They demanded Indonesian independence, displayed the red-and-white flag, and sang the Indonesian national anthem written by Wage Rudolf Supratman. The Dutch banned the flag, the national anthem, and the words &quot;Indonesia&quot; and &quot;Indonesian&quot;.
On 5 March 1942, Batavia fell to the Japanese. The Dutch formally surrendered to the Japanese occupation forces on 9 March 1942, and the colony&#x27;s government was transferred to Japan. Batavia was renamed Jakarta. The economic situation and the physical condition of Indonesian cities deteriorated during the occupation. Buildings were converted to internment camps for the Dutch.

After the Japanese defeat in 1945, the region experienced a period of transition and upheaval during the Indonesian struggle for independence. During the Japanese occupation, and when the Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945, the city was renamed Jakarta. In 1945, it was briefly occupied by the Allies and returned to the Dutch. The Dutch name, Batavia, remained the internationally recognized name until Indonesian independence was achieved and Jakarta proclaimed the national capital on 27 December 1949.

==Society==

Batavia, founded as the trade and administrative center of the VOC, was never intended to be a Dutch settlement. Jan Pieterszoon Coen founded Batavia for trade, with the city&#x27;s inhabitants producing and supplying food. There was no migration of intact Dutch families, and there were few Dutch women in Batavia. A mixed society was formed; relationships between Dutchmen and Asian women did not usually result in marriage, and the women did not have the right to return to the Dutch Republic. This societal pattern created a group of mestizos in Batavia. Since the VOC preferred to maintain complete control of its business, a large number of slaves was employed.

Women became an important feature of Batavia&#x27;s social network; they were accustomed to dealing with slaves, and spoke the same language (mostly Portuguese and Malay). Many of these women effectively became widows; their husbands left Batavia to return to the Netherlands, and their children were often removed as well.

Most of Batavia&#x27;s residents were of Asian descent. Thousands of slaves were brought from India and Arakan; later, slaves were brought from Bali and Sulawesi. To avoid an uprising, a decision was made to free the Javanese people from slavery. Chinese people made up the largest group in Batavia (most being merchants and laborers), and were the most decisive group in the city&#x27;s development. Other residents included Malays and Muslim and Hindu merchants from India.

Initially, these ethnic groups lived together; however, in 1688, segregation was imposed on the indigenous population. Each ethnic group was forced to live in its own village outside the city wall. Each person was tagged to identify their ethnic group; later, the identity tags were replaced with parchment.

Batavia experienced more malaria epidemics during the 18th century, as its marsh areas bred mosquitoes. The disease killed many Europeans and Batavia received the nickname &quot;cemetery of Europeans&quot;. Wealthier European settlers moved to southern areas at higher elevations.

Within Batavia&#x27;s walls, the wealthy Dutch built tall houses and canals. Commercial opportunities attracted Indonesian and Chinese immigrants, with the increasing population imposing a burden on the city. During the 18th century, over 60 percent of Batavia&#x27;s population were slaves working for the VOC. Laws protected slaves against overly cruel actions by their masters; Christian slaves were freed after the death of their masters, and other slaves were allowed to own a store and earn money to buy their freedom.

Although Batavia became the political and administrative center of the Dutch East Indies and the main port in Southeast Asian trade, the city&#x27;s population remained relatively small. Early-19th-century estimates of its population were smaller than that of Surabaya, although it overtook the latter by the end of the century; the 1920 census indicated a population of 306,000, compared to 192,000 for Surabaya, 158,000 for Semarang and 134,000 for Surakarta. Its population increased rapidly, exceeding half a million ten years later.

The population of the Dutch East Indies was never purely European. Of the 30,000 Dutch citizens in the Dutch East Indies in 1860, less than 5,000 were purely Dutch. Seventy percent of the population was male, since more male immigrants arrived from Europe.

Slavery existed in Batavia until its abolition in 1853. Slaves mainly lived in the back of the garden of the main house and were paid, with free food and lodging. Female slaves, known as &quot;baboe&quot;, cooked and cared for children.

Children went to school, where the teachers were locally trained. Many children did not finish school; to counter this, the school system awarded prizes to well-performing children.

When Stamford Raffles was governor of Java, he changed social interaction in Batavian society. Raffles disapproved of the relaxed Dutch dress code, where many men wore Javanese attire. Raffles and his wife, Olivia, introduced European dress (with much white, because of the tropical climate) for men and women.

When the British left Batavia in 1815, most of the native people reverted to their original Javanese attire but some new aspects persisted. Native males chosen to be the governing elite wore a European outfit on duty, but after hours they would change to sarongs and kebaya. Lower-ranked Dutchmen might wear the local style all day. Women wore sarongs and kebaya to official events, where they wore tighter-fitting robes or richly colored (or flowered) cloth—in the style of British India—and batik shawls.

<doc id="354070" wikidata="Q60815" url="?curid=354070" title="Brian Greene">
<text>Brian Randolph Greene (born February 9, 1963) is an American physicist known for his research on string theory. He is a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, director of its center for theoretical physics, and the chairman of the World Science Festival, which he co-founded in 2008. Greene co-discovered mirror symmetry, relating two different Calabi–Yau manifolds. He also described the flop transition, a mild form of topology change, and the conifold transition, a more severe transformation of space, showing that topology can smoothly change in string theory.

His books &quot;The Elegant Universe (1999)&quot;, &quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos (2011)&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Reality (2015)&quot;, and &quot;Until the End of Time&quot; (2020) were all top 10 New York Times bestsellers. Greene hosted two Emmy and Peabody Award Winning NOVA miniseries based on his books. He also appeared on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; episode &quot;The Herb Garden Germination&quot;, as well as in the films &quot;Frequency&quot; and &quot;The Last Mimzy&quot;. From 2015 to 2020, he served on the board of overseers of Harvard University, and is currently a member of the board of sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Greene was born in New York City of Jewish background. His father, Alan Greene, was a one-time vaudeville performer and high school dropout who later worked as a voice coach and composer.

After graduating from Stuyvesant High School in 1980, where he was classmates with fellow physicist and science popularizer Lisa Randall, Greene studied physics at Harvard University, graduating in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. He then did doctoral study in theoretical physics at Magdalen College, Oxford, under Graham Ross and James Binney. He received a Doctor of Philosophy in 1987 with a thesis entitled &quot;Superstrings: topology, geometry and phenomenology and astrophysical implications of supersymmetric models&quot;. While at Oxford, Greene also studied piano with the concert pianist Jack Gibbons.

==Academic career==
Greene joined the physics faculty of Cornell University in 1990, received tenure in 1993, and was appointed to a full professorship in 1995. The following year, he joined the faculty of Columbia University as a full professor. At Columbia, Greene is director of the university’s center for theoretical physics and is leading a research program at the intersection of string theory, mathematical physics, and cosmology.

===Research===
Greene&#x27;s area of research is string theory, a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. He is known for his contribution to the understanding of the different shapes the curled-up dimensions of string theory can take. The most important of these shapes are so-called Calabi–Yau manifolds; when the extra dimensions take on those particular forms, physics in three dimensions exhibits an abstract symmetry known as supersymmetry.

Greene co-discovered a particular class of symmetry relating two different Calabi–Yau manifolds, known as mirror symmetry and is known for his research on the flop-transition, a mild form of topology change, and also the conifold transition, a more severe transformation of space, showing that topology in string theory can change smoothly.

Greene has also studied string cosmology, especially the imprints of trans-Planckian physics on the cosmic microwave background, and brane-gas cosmologies that could explain why the space around us has three large dimensions. His work has expanded on the suggestion of a black hole electron, namely that a black hole can continuously transform into a particle such as an electron.

Currently, Greene is studying non-simply connected and non-orientable compactifications and has showed that in some of these contexts, signals can have an effective speed greater than that of light, and even travel back in time.

== Communicating Science ==

=== Books ===
Greene is well known to a wider audience for his work on popularizing theoretical physics, in particular string theory and the search for a unified theory of physics. His first book, &quot;The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory&quot;, published in 1999 and a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller, is a popularization of superstring theory and M-theory. It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, and winner of &quot;The Aventis Prizes for Science Books&quot; in 2000.

Greene&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality&quot; (2004), a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller, is about space, time, and the nature of the universe. Aspects covered in this book include non-local particle entanglement as it relates to special relativity and basic explanations of string theory. It is an examination of the very nature of matter and reality, covering such topics as spacetime and cosmology, origins and unification, and including an exploration into reality and the imagination.

Greene&#x27;s third book, &quot;The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos&quot;, published in January 2011, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller and deals in greater depth with multiple universes, or, as they are sometimes referred to collectively, the multiverse.

Greene&#x27;s most recent book, &quot;Until the End of Time: Mind Matter and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe&quot; (2020), was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller and explores the universe’s evolution and likely end, as well as the emergence of life and consciousness, bridging cosmological and existentialist thought.

=== Documentary Television ===
Greene’s first book, &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot;, was adapted into a three-part PBS television special of the same name, hosted and narrated by Greene, which won a 2003 Peabody Award.

Greene’s second book, &quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos&quot;, was adapted into a four-part PBS television special of the same name, hosted and narrated by Greene, which premiered in 2011 and was nominated for multiple Emmy Awards.

Greene was also featured in ABC’s &quot;Nightline in Primetime: Brave New World&quot; series.

=== Stage Works ===
Greene worked with by composer Philip Glass, playwright David Henry Hwang, filmmakers AL and AL, and executive producer Tracy Day to adapt Greene’s novella &quot;Icarus at the Edge of Time&quot;, which is a futuristic re-telling of the Icarus myth, into a stage work for full orchestra, film, and narrator. The work premiered on June 6, 2010 at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, with narrator John Lithgow, as part of World Science Festival. &quot;Icarus at the Edge of Time&quot; has since been performed 55 times in 31 cities and 13 countries, with narrators including Liev Schreiber, Kate Mulgrew, Levar Burton, and David Morrissey.

Greene wrote the stage work &quot;Light Falls: Space, Time, and an Obsession of Einstein&quot;, which traces Albert Einstein’s discovery of the General Theory of Relativity, and his subsequent failed attempts to find what he called “the unified theory.” The original score was written by Jeff Beal and visuals and stage production were created by 59 Productions, with executive producer Tracy Day. The work premiered on February 19, 2019 at the Gerald Lynch Theater in New York City, with Greene in the role of narrator, and was filmed by Great Performances for national broadcast on PBS on the centenary of the confirmation of General Relativity, May 29, 2019.

Greene wrote the stage work &quot;Time, Creativity and the Cosmos&quot;, exploring the origin of the universe, life, and creative expression, which premiered on May 30, 2017 at Lincoln Center’s Rose Theater, with Greene in the role of narrator and performers Pilobolus, Joshua Bell, Renee Fleming, Brian Stokes Mitchell, and David Draiman.

===World Science Festival===
In 2008, together with former ABC News producer Tracy Day, Greene co-founded the World Science Festival as a forum for cultivating “a general public informed by science, inspired by its wonder, convinced of its value, and prepared to engage with its implications for the future.” Since its founding, the World Science Festival has produced more than a thousand live and digital programs on subjects including cosmology, astronomy, quantum mechanics, particle physics, black holes, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, consciousness, quantum biology, genius, creativity, astrobiology, extrasolar planets, psychedelics. These programs have involved hundreds of scientists, technologists, and artists.

=== Media ===
The popularity of his books and his natural on-camera demeanor have resulted in many media appearances, including &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, CNN, ABC News, CBS News, The History Channel, &quot;Conan&quot;, The Science Channel, The Discovery Channel, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, &quot;The Art Bell Show&quot;, Coast to Coast AM, &quot;BBC World News America&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Radiolab&quot;, and &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;. He was interviewed at length by Jim Al-Khalili on the BBC radio program &quot;The Life Scientific&quot; on 28 April 2020. In April 2011, Greene appeared as himself on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; in the episode &quot;The Herb Garden Germination&quot;, speaking to a small crowd about the contents of his most recent book.

Greene was a technical consultant for the film &quot;Frequency&quot;, in which he also had a cameo role. He was a consultant on the 2006 time-travel movie &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;. He also had a cameo appearance as an Intel scientist in 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Last Mimzy&quot;. Greene was also mentioned in the 2002 &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;Supersymmetry&quot; and in the 2008 &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; episode &quot;Trio&quot;.

Greene has lectured outside of the collegiate setting, at both a general and a technical level, in more than twenty-five countries and all seven continents. In 2012, he received the Richtmyer Memorial Award, which is given annually by the American Association of Physics Teachers.

In May 2013, the Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 (H.R. 1891; 113th Congress) was introduced into Congress. Brian Greene was listed by one commentator as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass.

In March 2015, an Australian spider that uses waves to hunt prey, &quot;Dolomedes briangreenei&quot;, was to be named in honor of Brian Greene.

Greene is married to former ABC producer Tracy Day. They have one son, Alec, and one daughter, Sophia. Greene has been vegetarian since he was nine years old and a vegan since 1997.

Greene has stated that he regards science as being incompatible with literalist interpretations of religion and that there is much in the New Atheism movement which resonates with him because he personally does not feel the need for religious explanation. However, he is uncertain of its efficacy as a strategy for spreading a scientific worldview. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; he stated: &quot;When I&#x27;m looking to understand myself as a human, and how I fit in to the long chain of human culture that reaches back thousands of years, religion is a deeply valuable part of that story.&quot;

<doc id="354073" wikidata="Q29024967" url="?curid=354073" title="Planning permission in the United Kingdom">
<text>Planning permission in the United Kingdom is the planning permission required in the United Kingdom in order to be allowed to build on land, or change the use of land or buildings. Within the UK the occupier of any land or building will need title to that land or building (i.e. &quot;ownership&quot;), but will also need &quot;planning title&quot; or planning permission. Planning title was granted for all pre-existing uses and buildings by the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, which came into effect on 1 July 1948. Since that date any new &quot;development&quot; has required planning permission. 

==Development and permitted development==
&quot;Development&quot; as defined by law consists of any building, engineering or mining operation, or the making of a material change of use in any land or building. Certain types of operation such as routine maintenance of an existing building are specifically excluded from the definition of development.

Specified categories of development are granted an automatic planning permission by law, and therefore do not require any application for planning permission. These categories are referred to as permitted development.

In the case of any proposal there is therefore a two-stage test: &quot;is the proposal development at all?&quot; and, if the proposal is development, &quot;is it permitted development?&quot; Only if a development is not permitted development would an application for planning permission be required. An application for planning permission should be made to the local planning authority (LPA).

==Local planning authorities==
LPAs are generally the local borough or district council (&#x27;local authority&#x27; in Scotland), although an application for a mining operation, minerals extraction, or a waste management facility would be decided by the local county council in non-metropolitan areas. Within a national park planning applications are submitted to the national park authority.

All LPAs have their own website which will access relevant application forms, contact details and other relevant documents. They are generally receptive to pre-application discussion in order to clarify whether a proposal will require planning permission and, assuming that it does, the probability of such planning permission being granted.

==Determination==
The law requires that all applications for planning permission should be decided in accordance with the policies of the &quot;development plan&quot; – unless material planning considerations indicate otherwise. The decision on any planning application is therefore &quot;policy-led&quot; rather than &quot;influence-led&quot;. Although the public and nearby residents will be consulted about almost any planning application, the decision will not be made on the grounds of popularity or unpopularity. The framing of the decision by reference to published planning policy prevents the decision on a planning application being made on grounds which are arbitrary, perverse, or subject to impropriety.

It is therefore most important that applicants for planning permission satisfy themselves about the relevant local development plan policies before making an application. These can also be viewed via the LPA&#x27;s website, or the UK government&#x27;s &quot;Planning Portal&quot;, which provides a nationwide clearing house on planning information and advice for both government and local planning policies. As a practical matter it is very advisable to discuss proposals with the LPA or an experienced planning consultant who can provide independent advice before incurring the fees and other costs that are involved in making a planning application, or the delays and abortive costs that would arise from the refusal of planning permission.

==Types of application==
A number of different types of planning permission can be applied for:

*Full planning permission: a full planning permission would grant permission for all aspects of the proposed development, although it would generally be subject to various conditions (see below).
*Outline planning permission: outline planning permission establishes whether the scale and nature of a proposed development would be acceptable to the local planning authority. It might be appropriate when an applicant is seeking an agreement &quot;in principle&quot; to a proposed development, without being committed to a particular form of design or layout.
*Approval of &quot;reserved matters&quot;: seeking permission for those aspects that were not dealt with in an outline planning permission, or seeking approval of aspects of a development which were reserved by a planning condition in an earlier grant of full planning permission.
*Hybrid: a LPA may accept a &#x27;hybrid&#x27; application, that is, one that seeks outline planning permission for one part and full planning permission for another part of the same site.

Once a permission has been granted, the following additional applications may be made:
*Renewal of planning permission: This would arise when an earlier outline or full planning permission was subject to a time-limiting condition which has since expired. In essence this requires the entire planning application to be reviewed in light of current rather than previous planning policies. Applications for renewal of an earlier planning permission are usually granted anew, unless there has been a significant change in the relevant material considerations which are to be weighed in the decision.
*Removal or alteration of a planning condition: As a matter of law, conditions should only be imposed on a grant of planning permission when compliance with that condition is essential to make an unacceptable development acceptable – so it would be refused planning permission were it not for that condition. If the applicant or developer wished to proceed with a development without compliance with a condition, or perhaps with the condition in an alternative form, then an application can be made to &quot;vary&quot; the condition concerned – possibly by deleting it or offering an alternative form of words. Note that the LPA cannot alter any planning condition which imposes a time limit when the development is to be commenced. That would require a re-application for full or outline planning permission, but since October 2009 it has been possible to apply to extend an existing consent.

The fee for each part would have to be calculated separately on the appropriate basis, subject to any relevant maximum, and the total - which would not be subject to any maximum - would then be chargeable. An authority may also, following discussion, allow an application to be separated into core elements so that permission for site preparation works, say, can be given priority. Whether to accept a proposal in hybrid form is at the discretion of the LPA, not something on which an applicant may insist. One should bear in mind that a LPA is empowered to require details even when the application is in outline, if necessary in the interest of good planning. The term ‘hybrid application’ is not defined in statute.

An application for a change of use of a site, for example from residential use to commercial use, may be made on its own or in conjunction with an application for permission to develop the site for new purpose. The legal framework of planning use classes in England is set out in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020 No.757), which took effect on 1 September 2020. These regulations amended the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987.

==Conditions==
In the United Kingdom a planning condition is a condition placed on a grant of planning permission. Such conditions permit development to go ahead only if certain conditions are satisfied. Conditions include time limits on development, undertakings regarding environmental and noise issues and limits on the size and external appearance of a new development.

Planning permissions are usually granted subject to a planning condition which requires the development to be commenced within three years. Typically they will also include a number of other conditions, for example undertakings regarding environmental and noise issues; limits on the size and external appearance of a new development; requirements for the scheme to be built in accordance with the approved drawings, trees to be planted as per the landscape scheme and replaced if they die in the first few years, or that the colour and finish of external materials be approved by the LPA. Some of these will need to be complied with before any work starts on site; others will take effect once the development is commenced, or later.

Most conditions imposed on a granted planning permission will relate to implementation of works within the actual site of the application (the edges of which must be defined by a red line marked on an accurately scaled map of the site, usually an Ordnance Survey extract, accompanying the application). If there is a need to control aspects of the development which are required to occur outside the defined application site (such as related highway improvements) then the implementation of those aspects can be required by a Grampian condition. This would be worded to the effect that the development being permitted must not be commenced (or must not be occupied, as appropriate), until the required off-site works had been completed.

Planning conditions are imposed to require that something is done or not done by the developer in order to make the development acceptable. Sometimes, planning permission will only be granted subject to the applicant entering into a legal agreement under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act requiring that certain things be done or money be paid to the LPA e.g. to contribute towards the improvement of local highways, schools, open spaces or other facilities serving the development before the development is completed or occupied. Such contributions can only be required if they are necessary to make the development acceptable, reasonable, and relate directly to the development proposed.

Planning permission may also be declined where the development does not meet affordable housing targets. This was confirmed in the case of Parkhurst Road Ltd v Secretary of State for Communities And Local Government, in which Islington Council refused a developer&#x27;s application as it did not meet “the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing” (See judgment at paragraph 14). The developer&#x27;s argument that no affordable homes would be built if their proposal was refused was held to be no excuse not to meet affordable housing requirements. This judgment also demonstrates how overpaying for land for development does not allow developers to bypass affordable housing requirements by way of &#x27;self-inflicted financial unviability&#x27;.

==Criticism==
The planning permission system has been criticised for being &quot;too slow, bureaucratic and expensive&quot;, thus contributing to the housing crisis in the UK. As of January 2015, there were 150,000 homes waiting to progress from the &quot;outline&quot; planning stage to the &quot;detailed&quot; planning stage.

In the Commons Briefing Paper &#x27;Tackling the under-supply of housing in England&#x27;, Barton and Wilson argue that, due to the increased value granted planning permission can offer land, &quot;strategic land trading&quot; by developers is contributing to the UK&#x27;s housing crisis.

<doc id="354076" wikidata="Q1339474" url="?curid=354076" title="Maternal death">
<text>Maternal death or maternal mortality is defined in slightly different ways by several different health organizations. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines maternal death as the death of a pregnant mother due to complications related to pregnancy, underlying conditions worsened by the pregnancy or management of these conditions. This can occur either while she is pregnant or within six weeks of resolution of the pregnancy. The CDC definition of pregnancy-related deaths extends the period of consideration to include one year from the resolution of the pregnancy. Pregnancy associated death, as defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), are all deaths occurring within one year of a pregnancy resolution. Identification of pregnancy associated deaths is important for deciding whether or not the pregnancy was a direct or indirect contributing cause of the death.

There are two main measures used when talking about the rates of maternal mortality in a community or country. These are the maternal mortality ratio and maternal mortality rate, both abbreviated as &quot;MMR&quot;. By 2017, the world maternal mortality rate had declined 44% since 1990; however, every day 808 women die from pregnancy or childbirth related causes. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) 2017 report, about every 2 minutes a woman dies because of complications due to child birth or pregnancy. For every woman who dies, there are about 20 to 30 women who experience injury, infection, or other birth or pregnancy related complication.

UNFPA estimated that 303,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2015. The WHO divides causes of maternal deaths into two categories: direct obstetric deaths and indirect obstetric deaths. Direct obstetric deaths are causes of death due to complications of pregnancy, birth or termination. For example, these could range from severe bleeding to obstructed labor, for which there are highly effective interventions. Indirect obstetric deaths are caused by pregnancy interfering or worsening an existing condition, like a heart problem.

As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendant with backup emergency obstetric care, the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 385 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 216 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015. Many countries halved their maternal death rates in the last 10 years. Although attempts have been made to reduce maternal mortality, there is much room for improvement, particularly in low-resource regions. Over 85% of maternal deaths are in low-resource communities in Africa and Asia. In higher resource regions, there are still significant areas with room for growth, particularly as they relate to racial and ethnic disparities and inequities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates.

Overall, maternal mortality is an important marker of the health of the country and reflects on its health infrastructure. Lowering the amount of maternal death is an important goal of many health organizations world-wide.

==Causes==

=== Direct obstetric deaths ===

==== Overview ====
Direct obstetric deaths are due to complications of pregnancy, birth, termination or complications arising from their management.

The causes of maternal death vary by region and level of access. According to a study published in the &quot;Lancet&quot; which covered the period from 1990 to 2013, the most common causes of maternal death world-wide are postpartum bleeding (15%), complications from unsafe abortion (15%), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (10%), postpartum infections (8%), and obstructed labor (6%). Other causes include blood clots (3%) and pre-existing conditions (28%).

==== Descriptions by condition ====
Postpartum bleeding happens when there is uncontrollable bleeding from the uterus, cervix or vaginal wall after birth. This can happen when the uterus does not contract correctly after birth, there is left over placenta in the uterus, or there are cuts in the cervix or vagina from birth.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy happen when the body does not regulate blood pressure correctly. In pregnancy, this is due to changes at the level of the blood vessels, likely because of the placenta. This includes medical conditions like gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia.

Postpartum infections are infections of the uterus or other parts of the reproductive tract after the resolution of a pregnancy. They are usually bacterial and cause fever, increased pain, and foul-smelling discharge.

Obstructed labor happens when the baby does not properly move into the pelvis and out of the body during labor. The most common cause of obstructed labor is when the baby&#x27;s head is too big or angled at a way that does not allow it to pass through the pelvis and birth canal.

Blood clots can occur in different vessels in the body, including vessels in the arms, legs, and lungs. They can cause problems in the lung, as well as travel to the heart or brain, leading to complications.

==== Unsafe abortion ====

When abortion is legal and accessible, it is widely regarded as safer than carrying a pregnancy to term and delivery. In fact, a study published in the journal Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology reported that in the United States, carrying a pregnancy to term and delivering a baby comes with 14 times increased risk of death as compared to a legal abortion. However, in many regions of the world, abortion is not legal and can be unsafe. Maternal deaths caused by improperly performed procedures are preventable and contribute 13% to the maternal mortality rate worldwide. This number is increased to 25% in countries where other causes of maternal mortality are low, such as in Eastern European and South American countries. This makes unsafe abortion practices the leading cause of maternal death worldwide.

Unsafe abortion is another major cause of maternal death worldwide. In regions where abortion is legal and accessible, abortion is safe and does not contribute greatly to overall rates of maternal death. However, in regions where abortions are not legal, available, or regulated, unsafe abortion practices can cause significant rates of maternal death. According to the World Health Organization in 2009, every eight minutes a woman died from complications arising from unsafe abortions.

Unsafe abortion practices are defined by the WHO as procedures that are performed by someone without the appropriate training and/or ones that are performed in an environment that is not considered safe or clean. Using this definition, the WHO estimates that out of the 45 million abortions that are performed each year globally, 19 million of these are considered unsafe, and 97% of these unsafe abortions occur in developing countries. Complications include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis and genital trauma.

==== Rates ====
There are four primary types of data sources that are used to collect abortion-related maternal mortality rates: confidential enquiries, registration data, verbal autopsy, and facility-based data sources. A verbal autopsy is a systematic tool that is used to collect information on the cause of death from laypeople and not medical professionals.

Confidential enquires for maternal deaths do not occur very often on a national level in most countries. Registration systems are usually considered the &quot;gold-standard&quot; method for mortality measurements. However, they have been shown to miss anywhere between 30 and 50% of all maternal deaths. Another concern for registration systems is that 75% of all global births occur in countries where vital registration systems do not exist, meaning that many maternal deaths occurring during these pregnancies and deliveries may not be properly record through these methods. There are also issues with using verbal autopsies and other forms of survey in recording maternal death rates. For example, the family&#x27;s willingness to participate after the loss of a loved one, misclassification of the cause of death, and under-reporting all present obstacles to the proper reporting of maternal mortality causes. Finally, a potential issue with facility-based data collection on maternal mortality is the likelihood that women who experience abortion-related complications to seek care in medical facilities. This is due to fear of social repercussions or legal activity in countries where unsafe abortion is common since it is more likely to be legally restrictive and/or more highly stigmatizing. Another concern for issues related to errors in proper reporting for accurate understanding of maternal mortality is the fact that global estimates of maternal deaths related to a specific cause present those related to abortion as a proportion of the total mortality rate. Therefore, any change, whether positive or negative, in the abortion-related mortality rate is only compared relative to other causes, and this does not allow for proper implications of whether abortions are becoming more safe or less safe with respect to the overall mortality of women.

==== Prevention ====
The prevention and reduction of maternity death is one of the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goal 3, &quot;Good health and well being&quot;. Promoting effective contraceptive use and information distributed to a wider population, with access to high-quality care, can make steps towards reducing the number of unsafe abortions. For nations that allow contraceptives, programs should be instituted to allow the easier accessibility of these medications. However, this alone will not eliminate the demand for safe services, awareness on safe abortion services, health education on prenatal check ups and proper implementation of diets during pregnancy and lactation also contributes to its prevention.

=== Indirect obstetric deaths ===
Indirect obstetric deaths are caused by preexisting health problem worsened by pregnancy or newly developed health problem unrelated to pregnancy . Fatalities during but unrelated to a pregnancy are termed &quot;accidental&quot;, &quot;incidental&quot;, or non-obstetrical maternal deaths.

Indirect causes include malaria, anemia, HIV/AIDS, and cardiovascular disease, all of which may complicate pregnancy or be aggravated by it. Risk factors associated with increased maternal death include the age of the mother, obesity before becoming pregnant, other pre-existing chronic medical conditions, and cesarean delivery.

=== Risk factors ===
According to a 2004 WHO publication, sociodemographic factors such as age, access to resources and income level are significant indicators of maternal outcomes. Young mothers face higher risks of complications and death during pregnancy than older mothers, especially adolescents aged 15 years or younger. Adolescents have higher risks for postpartum hemorrhage, endometritis, operative vaginal delivery, episiotomy, low birth weight, preterm delivery, and small-for-gestational-age infants, all of which can lead to maternal death. The leading cause of death for girls at the age of 15 in developing countries is complication through pregnancy and childbirth. They have more pregnancies, on average, than women in developed countries, and it has been shown that 1 in 180 15-year-old girls in developing countries who become pregnant will die due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth. This is compared to women in developed countries, where the likelihood is 1 in 4900 live births. However, in the United States, as many women of older age continue to have children, the maternal mortality rate has risen in some states, especially among women over 40 years old.

Structural support and family support influences maternal outcomes. Furthermore, social disadvantage and social isolation adversely affects maternal health which can lead to increases in maternal death. Additionally, lack of access to skilled medical care during childbirth, the travel distance to the nearest clinic to receive proper care, number of prior births, barriers to accessing prenatal medical care and poor infrastructure all increase maternal deaths.

=== Causes of maternal death in the US ===
Pregnancy-related deaths between 2011 and 2014 in the United States have been shown to have major contributions from non-communicable diseases and conditions, and the following are some of the more common causes related to maternal death: cardiovascular diseases (15.2%.), non-cardiovascular diseases (14.7%), infection or sepsis (12.8%), hemorrhage (11.5%), cardiomyopathy (10.3%), pulmonary embolism (9.1%), cerebrovascular accidents (7.4%), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (6.8%), amniotic fluid embolism (5.5%), and anesthesia complications (0.3%).

===Three delays model===
The three delays model describes three critical factors that inhibit women from receiving appropriate maternal health care. These factors include:

# Delay in seeking care
# Delay in reaching care
# Delay in receiving adequate and appropriate care

Delays in seeking care are due to the decisions made by the women who are pregnant and/or other decision-making individuals. Decision-making individuals can include a spouse and family members. Examples of reasons for delays in seeking care include lack of knowledge about when to seek care, inability to afford health care, and women needing permission from family members.

Delays in reaching care include factors such as limitations in transportation to a medical facility, lack of adequate medical facilities in the area, and lack in confidence in medicine.

Delays in receiving adequate and appropriate care may result from an inadequate number of trained providers, lack of appropriate supplies, and the lack of urgency or understanding of an emergency.

The three delays model illustrates that there are a multitude of complex factors, both socioeconomic and cultural, that can result in maternal death.

==Measurement==

The four measures of maternal death are the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), maternal mortality rate, lifetime risk of maternal death and proportion of maternal deaths among deaths of women of reproductive years (PM).

Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is the ratio of the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time-period. The MMR is used as a measure of the quality of a health care system.

Maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is the number of maternal deaths in a population divided by the number of women of reproductive age, usually expressed per 1,000 women.

Lifetime risk of maternal death is a calculated prediction of a woman&#x27;s risk of death after each consecutive pregnancy. The calculation pertains to women during their reproductive years. The adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality can be derived using either the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), or the maternal mortality rate (MMRate).

Proportion of maternal deaths among deaths of women of reproductive age (PM) is
the number of maternal deaths in a given time period divided by the total deaths among women aged 15–49 years.

Approaches to measuring maternal mortality include civil registration system, household surveys, census, reproductive age mortality studies (RAMOS) and verbal autopsies. The most common household survey method, recommended by the WHO as time- and cost-effective, is the sisterhood method.

===Trends===
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA; formerly known as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities) have established programs that support efforts in reducing maternal death. These efforts include education and training for midwives, supporting access to emergency services in obstetric and newborn care networks, and providing essential drugs and family planning services to pregnant women or those planning to become pregnant. They also support efforts for review and response systems regarding maternal deaths.

According to the 2010 United Nations Population Fund report, low-resource nations account for ninety-nine percent of maternal deaths with the majority of those deaths occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Globally, high and middle income countries experience lower maternal deaths than low income countries. The Human Development Index (HDI) accounts for between 82 and 85 percent of the maternal mortality rates among countries. In most cases, high rates of maternal deaths occur in the same countries that have high rates of infant mortality. These trends are a reflection that higher income countries have stronger healthcare infrastructure, more doctors, use more advanced medical technologies and have fewer barriers to accessing care than low income countries. In low income countries, the most common cause of maternal death is obstetrical hemorrhage, followed by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This is contrast to high income countries, for which the most common cause is thromboembolism.

Between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio has decreased from 385 deaths per 100,000 live births to 216 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Some factors that have been attributed to the decreased maternal deaths seen between this period are in part to the access that women have gained to family planning services and skilled birth attendance, meaning a midwife, doctor, or trained nurse), with back-up obstetric care for emergency situations that may occur during the process of labor. This can be examined further by looking at statistics in some areas of the world where inequities in access to health care services reflect an increased number of maternal deaths. The high maternal death rates also reflect disparate access to health services between resource communities and those that are high-resource or affluent.

The disparities in maternal health outcomes are also present among racial groups. In the United States, black women are 3-4 times more likely to die from maternal mortality than white women. Unequal access to quality medical care, socioeconomic disparities, and systemic racism by health care providers are factors that have contributed to the high maternal mortality rates among black women. Discounting factors such as pre-existing conditions, do not impact the rate of this disparity. In 2019, Black maternal health advocate and &quot;Parents&quot; writer Christine Michel Carter interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris. As a senator, in 2019 Harris reintroduced the Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies (CARE) Act which aimed to address the maternal mortality disparity faced by women of color by training providers on recognizing implicit racial bias and its impact on care. Harris stated:&quot;We need to speak the uncomfortable truth that women—and especially Black women—are too often not listened to or taken seriously by the health care system, and therefore they are denied the dignity that they deserve. And we need to speak this truth because today, the United States is 1 of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal mortality is worse than it was 25 years ago. That risk is even higher for Black women, who are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related causes. These numbers are simply outrageous.&quot;The Covid-19 pandemic heightened maternal mortality rates, disproportionately impacting communities of color. Multiple factors contribute to this widening disparity, notably, social factors such as implicit bias, repeated racial discrimination, and limited access to healthcare. All issues are further exacerbated for people of color who face systemic barriers to adequate medical care. Overall, the maternal mortality rate increased from 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020, to 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021. An apparent spike in this rate can be noted in 2021. For non-hispanic black women the rate of maternal deaths per 100,00 live births increased from 44.0 in 2019 to 69.9 in 2021.

==Prevention==
According to UNFPA, there are four essential elements for prevention of maternal death. These include, prenatal care, assistance with birth, access to emergency obstetric care and adequate postnatal care. It is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and fetus. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are hemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labor. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time, bleeding, sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur, and newborns are extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker to assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended.

Additionally, reliable access to information, compassionate counseling and quality services for the management of any issues that arise from abortions (whether safe or unsafe) can be beneficial in reducing the number of maternal deaths. In regions where abortion is legal, abortion practices need to be safe in order to effectively reduce the number of maternal deaths related to abortion.

Maternal Death Surveillance and Response is another strategy that has been used to prevent maternal death. This is one of the interventions proposed to reduce maternal mortality where maternal deaths are continuously reviewed to learn the causes and factors that led to the death. The information from the reviews is used to make recommendations for action to prevent future similar deaths. Maternal and perinatal death reviews have been in practice for a long time worldwide, and the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) with a guideline in 2013. Studies have shown that acting on recommendations from MPDSR can reduce maternal and perinatal mortality by improving quality of care in the community and health facilities.

=== Prenatal care ===
It was estimated that in 2015, a total of 303,000 women died due to causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. The majority of these were due to severe bleeding, sepsis or infections, eclampsia, obstructed labor, and consequences from unsafe abortions. Most of these causes are either preventable or have highly effective interventions. An important factor that contributes to the maternal mortality rate is access and opportunity to receive prenatal care. Women who do not receive prenatal care are between three and four times more likely to die from complications resulting from pregnancy or delivery than those who receive prenatal care. Even in high-resource countries, many women do not receive the appropriate preventative or prenatal care. For example, 25% of women in the United States do not receive the recommended number of prenatal visits. This number increases for women among traditionally marginalized populations—32% of African American women and 41% for American Indian and Alaska Native women do not receive the recommended preventative health services prior to delivery.

In 2023, a study reported that deaths among Native American women was three-and-a-half times that of white women. The report attributed the high rate in part to the fact that Native American women are cared for under a poorly funded Federal Health Care System that is so stretched that the average monthly visit lasts only from three to seven minutes. Such a short visit allows neither time for performing an adequate health assessment nor time for the patient to discuss any problems she may be experiencing.

===Medical technologies===
The decline in maternal deaths has been due largely to improved aseptic techniques, better fluid management and quicker access to blood transfusions, and better prenatal care.

Technologies have been designed for resource poor settings that have been effective in reducing maternal deaths as well. The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment is a low-technology pressure device that decreases blood loss, restores vital signs and helps buy time in delay of women receiving adequate emergency care during obstetric hemorrhage. It has proven to be a valuable resource. Condoms used as uterine tamponades have also been effective in stopping post-partum hemorrhage.

=== Medications and surgical management ===
Some maternal deaths can be prevented through medication use. Injectable oxytocin can be used to prevent death due to postpartum bleeding. Additionally, postpartum infections can be treated using antibiotics. In fact, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics both for the prevention and treatment of maternal infection is common in low-income countries. Maternal death due to eclampsia can also be prevented through the use of medications such as magnesium sulfate.

Many complications can be managed with procedures and/or surgery if there is access to a qualified surgeon and appropriate facilities and supplies. For example, the contents of the uterus can be cleaned if there is concern for remaining pregnancy tissue or infection. If there is concern for excess bleeding, special ties, stitches or tools (Bakri Balloon) can be placed if there is concern for excess bleeding.

===Public health===
A public health approach to addressing maternal mortality includes gathering information on the scope of the problem, identifying key causes, and implementing interventions, both prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy, to combat those causes and prevent maternal mortality.

Public health has a role to play in the analysis of maternal death. One important aspect in the review of maternal death and its causes are Maternal Mortality Review Committees or Boards. The goal of these review committees are to analyze each maternal death and determine its cause. After this analysis, the information can be combined in order to determine specific interventions that could lead to preventing future maternal deaths. These review boards are generally comprehensive in their analysis of maternal deaths, examining details that include mental health factors, public transportation, chronic illnesses, and substance use disorders. All of this information can be combined to give a detailed picture of what is causing maternal mortality and help to determine recommendations to reduce their impact.

Many states within the US are taking Maternal Mortality Review Committees a step further and are collaborating with various professional organizations to improve quality of perinatal care. These teams of organizations form a &quot;perinatal quality collaborative&quot; (PQC) and include state health departments, the state hospital association and clinical professionals such as doctors and nurses. These PQCs can also involve community health organizations, Medicaid representatives, Maternal Mortality Review Committees and patient advocacy groups. By involving all of these major players within maternal health, the goal is to collaborate and determine opportunities to improve quality of care. Through this collaborative effort, PQCs can aim to make impacts on quality both at the direct patient care level and through larger system devices like policy. It is thought that the institution of PQCs in California was the main contributor to the maternal mortality rate decreasing by 50% in the years following. The PQC developed review guides and quality improvement initiatives aimed at the most preventable and prevalent maternal deaths: those due to bleeding and high blood pressure. Success has also been observed with PQCs in Illinois and Florida.

Several interventions prior to pregnancy have been recommended in efforts to reduce maternal mortality. Increasing access to reproductive healthcare services, such as family planning services and safe abortion practices, is recommended in order to prevent unintended pregnancies. Several countries, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, have seen some success in efforts to promote the use of reproductive healthcare services. Other interventions include high quality sex education, which includes pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and treatment. By addressing STIs, this not only reduces perinatal infections, but can also help reduce ectopic pregnancy caused by STIs. Adolescent mothers are between two and five times more likely to die than a female twenty years or older. Access to reproductive services and sex education could make a large impact, specifically on adolescents, who are generally uneducated in regards to carrying a healthy pregnancy. Education level is a strong predictor of maternal health as it gives women the knowledge to seek care when it is needed. Public health efforts can also intervene during pregnancy to improve maternal outcomes. Areas for intervention have been identified in access to care, public knowledge, awareness about signs and symptoms of pregnancy complications, and improving relationships between healthcare professionals and expecting mothers.

Access to care during pregnancy is a significant issue in the face of maternal mortality. &quot;Access&quot; encompasses a wide range of potential difficulties including costs, location of healthcare services, availability of appointments, availability of trained health care workers, transportation services, and cultural or language barriers that could inhibit a woman from receiving proper care. For women carrying a pregnancy to term, access to necessary antenatal (prior to delivery) healthcare visits is crucial to ensuring healthy outcomes. These antenatal visits allow for early recognition and treatment of complications, treatment of infections and the opportunity to educate the expecting mother on how to manage her current pregnancy and the health advantages of spacing pregnancies apart.

Access to birth at a facility with a skilled healthcare provider present has been associated with safer deliveries and better outcomes. The two areas bearing the largest burden of maternal mortality, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, also had the lowest percentage of births attended by a skilled provider, at just 45% and 41% respectively. Emergency obstetric care is also crucial in preventing maternal mortality by offering services like emergency cesarean sections, blood transfusions, antibiotics for infections and assisted vaginal delivery with forceps or vacuum. In addition to physical barriers that restrict access to healthcare, financial barriers also exist. Close to one out of seven women of child-bearing age have no health insurance. This lack of insurance impacts access to pregnancy prevention, treatment of complications, as well as perinatal care visits contributing to maternal mortality.

By increasing public knowledge and awareness through health education programs about pregnancy, including signs of complications that need addressed by a healthcare provider, this will increase the likelihood of an expecting mother to seek help when it is necessary. Higher levels of education have been associated with increased use of contraception and family planning services as well as antenatal care. Addressing complications at the earliest sign of a problem can improve outcomes for expecting mothers, which makes it extremely important for a pregnant woman to be knowledgeable enough to seek healthcare for potential complications. Improving the relationships between patients and the healthcare system as a whole will make it easier for a pregnant woman to feel comfortable seeking help. Good communication between patients and providers, as well as cultural competence of the providers, could also assist in increasing compliance with recommended treatments.

Another important preventive measure being implemented is specialized education for mothers. Doctors and medical professionals providing simple information to women, especially women in lower socioeconomic areas will decrease the miscommunication that often occurs between doctors and patients. Training health care professionals will be another important aspect in decreasing the rate of maternal death, &quot;The study found that white medical students and residents often believed incorrect and sometimes &#x27;fantastical&#x27; biological fallacies about racial differences in patients. For these assumptions, researchers blamed not individual prejudice but deeply ingrained unconscious stereotypes about people of color, as well as physicians&#x27; difficulty in empathizing with patients whose experiences differ from their own.&quot;

===Policy===

The biggest global policy initiative for maternal health came from the United Nations&#x27; Millennium Declaration which created the Millennium Development Goals. In 2012, this evolved at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to become the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a target year of 2030. The SDGs are 17 goals that call for global collaboration to tackle a wide variety of recognized problems. Goal 3 is focused on ensuring health and well-being for women of all ages. A specific target is to achieve a global maternal mortality ratio of less than 70 per 100,000 live births. So far, specific progress has been made in births attended by a skilled provider, now at 80% of births worldwide compared with 62% in 2005.

Countries and local governments have taken political steps in reducing maternal deaths. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute studied maternal health systems in four apparently similar countries: Rwanda, Malawi, Niger, and Uganda. In comparison to the other three countries, Rwanda has an excellent record of improving maternal death rates. Based on their investigation of these varying country case studies, the researchers conclude that improving maternal health depends on three key factors:

# reviewing all maternal health-related policies frequently to ensure that they are internally coherent;
# enforcing standards on providers of maternal health services;
# any local solutions to problems discovered should be promoted, not discouraged.

In terms of aid policy, proportionally, aid given to improve maternal mortality rates has shrunken as other public health issues, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria have become major international concerns. Maternal health aid contributions tend to be lumped together with newborn and child health, so it is difficult to assess how much aid is given directly to maternal health to help lower the rates of maternal mortality. Regardless, there has been progress in reducing maternal mortality rates internationally.

In countries where abortion practices are not considered legal, it is necessary to look at the access that women have to high-quality family planning services, since some of the restrictive policies around abortion could impede access to these services. These policies may also affect the proper collection of information for monitoring maternal health around the world.

==Epidemiology==

Maternal mortality and morbidity are leading contributors in women&#x27;s health. It is estimated that 303,000 women are killed each year in childbirth and pregnancy worldwide. The global rate in 2017 is 211 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and 45% of postpartum deaths occur within 24 hours. Whereas in 2020, the global rate was 223 deaths per 100,000 live births. Ninety-nine percent of maternal deaths occur in low-resource countries.

=== Prevalence by country ===

India (19% or 56,000) and Nigeria (14% or 40,000) accounted for roughly one third of the maternal deaths in 2010. Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Sudan, Indonesia, Ethiopia, United Republic of Tanzania, Bangladesh and Afghanistan accounted for between 3 and 5 percent of maternal deaths each. These ten countries combined accounted for 60% of all the maternal deaths in 2010 according to the United Nations Population Fund report. Countries with the lowest maternal deaths were Greece, Iceland, Poland, and Finland.

In 2017, countries in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa account for approximately 86% of all maternal deaths worldwide. As of 2020, Sub-Saharan African countries such as South Sudan, Chad, and Nigeria had the highest maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Since 2000, Southeast Asian countries have seen a significant decrease in maternal mortality of almost 60%. Sub-Saharan Africa also saw an almost 40% decrease in maternal mortality between 2000 and 2017.

=== Ethnicity ===
In the United States, women who are black and non-Hispanic experience pregnancy-related death at a significantly higher rate. They are three to four times as likely to succumb to maternal mortality than non-Hispanic white women. In the United States between the years of 2007 and 2014, women who identify as non-Hispanic and black had a significant increase in death related to pregnancy. Similar patterns exist in other countries. In Brazil, women who are not white were 3.5 times as likely to die because of obstetric mortality compared to white women. The maternal mortality ratio is larger in women who are from Sub-Saharan African in France.

In the United States, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the maternal mortality rate in 2021 was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births. This is significantly higher than the rates in 2020 defined as 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births and 20.1 in 2019. In 2021, the maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women was 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is 2.6 times higher than non-Hispanic White women. The mortality rate for women over the age of 40 was 6.8 times higher than the rate for women under the age of 25.

=== COVID-19 effects ===
Global maternal mortality and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in maternal deaths, stillbirths, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression occurred globally during this time. According to The Lancet Global Health, their search, which included over 40 studies, identified significant increases in stillbirth and maternal death during the pandemic versus before the pandemic. According to the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, a proportion of total COVID-19 deaths were indirect obstetric deaths where a woman&#x27;s death was due to the aggravation between the disease and the state of pregnancy. Some outcomes show considerable disparity between low- and high-resource settings. This drives the urgent global need to prioritize safe, equitable, and accessible maternal care in future healthcare crises.

=== Progression of policy ===
Significant progress has been made since the United Nations made the reduction of maternal mortality part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. Bangladesh, for example, cut the number of deaths per live births by almost two-thirds from 1990 to 2015. A further reduction of maternal mortality is now part of the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development. The United Nations recently developed a list of goals termed the Sustainable Development Goals. Some of the specific aims of the Sustainable Development Goals are to prevent unintended pregnancies by ensuring more women have access to contraceptives, as well as providing women who become pregnant with a safe environment for delivery with respectful and skilled care. This initiative also included access to emergency services for women who developed complications during delivery.

=== Prevention strategies ===
The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a global goal to end preventable death related to maternal mortality. A major goal of this strategy is to identify and address the causes of maternal and reproductive morbidities and mortalities. This strategy aims to address inequalities in access to reproductive, maternal, and newborn services, as well as the quality of care with universal health coverage. Maternal mortality is difficult to measure. Health information systems, such as the CRVS (Civil registration and Vital Statistics), in most low-income countries are weak. Therefore, these systems cannot provide accurate assessments of maternal mortality. Even estimates derived from complete system such as the CRVs, suffer misclassification, and underreporting statistics of maternal death. The WHO strategy also aims to ensure quality data collection in order to better respond to the needs of women and girls while improving the equity and quality of care provided to women.

===Variation within countries===
There are significant maternal mortality intra-country variations, especially in nations with large equality gaps in income and education and high healthcare disparities. Women living in rural areas experience higher maternal mortality than women living in urban and sub-urban centers because those living in wealthier households, having higher education, or living in urban areas, have higher use of healthcare services than their poorer, less-educated, or rural counterparts. There are also racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes which increases maternal mortality in marginalized groups.

===Maternal mortality ratio by country===

The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes).
In the year 2017, 810 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and birth per day which totaled to approximately 295,000 maternal deaths that year alone. It was also estimated that 94% of maternal deaths occurred in low-resource countries in the same year.

In a retrospective study done across several countries in 2007, the cause of death and causal relationship to the mode of delivery in pregnant women was examined from the years 2000 to 2006. It was discovered that the excess maternal death rate of women who experienced a pulmonary embolism was casually related to undergoing a cesarean delivery. There was also an association found between neuraxial anesthesia, more commonly known as an epidural, and an increased risk for an epidural hematoma. Both of these risks could be reduced by the institution of graduated compression, whether by compression stockings or a compression device. There is also speculation that eliminating the concept of elective cesarean sections in the United States would significantly lower the maternal death rate.

== Related terms ==

===Severe maternal morbidity===
Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is an unanticipated acute or chronic health outcome after labor and delivery that detrimentally affects a woman&#x27;s health. Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) includes any unexpected outcomes from labor or delivery that cause both short and long-term consequences to the mother&#x27;s overall health. There are nineteen total indicators used by the CDC to help identify SMM, with the most prevalent indicator being a blood transfusion. Other indicators include an acute myocardial infarction (&quot;heart attack&quot;), aneurysm, and kidney failure. All of this identification is done by using ICD-10 codes, which are disease identification codes found in hospital discharge data. Using these definitions that rely on these codes should be used with careful consideration since some may miss some cases, have a low predictive value, or may be difficult for different facilities to operationalize. There are certain screening criteria that may be helpful and are recommended through the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as well as the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM). These screening criteria for SMM are for transfusions of four or more units of blood and admission of a pregnant woman or a postpartum woman to an ICU facility or unit.

The greatest proportion of women with SMM are those who require a blood transfusion during delivery, mostly due to excessive bleeding. Blood transfusions given during delivery due to excessive bleeding has increased the rate of mothers with SMM. The rate of SMM has increased almost 200% between 1993 (49.5 per 100,000 live births) and 2014 (144.0 per 100,000 live births). This can be seen with the increased rate of blood transfusions given during delivery, which increased from 1993 (24.5 per 100,000 live births) to 2014 (122.3 per 100,000 live births).

In the United States, severe maternal morbidity has increased over the last several years, impacting greater than 50,000 women in 2014 alone. There is no conclusive reason for this dramatic increase. It is thought that the overall state of health for pregnant women is impacting these rates. For example, complications can derive from underlying chronic medical conditions like diabetes, obesity, HIV/AIDS, and high blood pressure. These underlying conditions are also thought to lead to increased risk of maternal mortality.

The increased rate for SMM can also be indicative of potentially increased rates for maternal mortality, since without identification and treatment of SMM, these conditions would lead to increased maternal death rates. Therefore, diagnosis of SMM can be considered a &quot;near miss&quot; for maternal mortality. With this consideration, several different expert groups have urged obstetric hospitals to review SMM cases for opportunities that can lead to improved care, which in turn would lead to improvements with maternal health and a decrease in the number of maternal deaths.

<text>Suspended animation is the temporary (short- or long-term) slowing or stopping of biological function so that physiological capabilities are preserved. States of suspended animation are common in micro-organisms and some plant tissue, such as seeds. Many animals, including large ones, may undergo hibernation, and most plants have periods of dormancy. This article focuses primarily on the potential of large animals, especially humans, to undergo suspended animation.

In animals, suspended animation may be either hypometabolic or ametabolic in nature. It may be induced by either endogenous, natural or artificial biological, chemical or physical means. In its natural form, it may be spontaneously reversible as in the case of species demonstrating hypometabolic states of hibernation. When applied with therapeutic intent, as in deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), usually technologically mediated revival is required.

== Basic principles ==
Suspended animation is understood as the pausing of life processes by external or internal means without terminating life itself. Breathing, heartbeat and other involuntary functions may still occur, but they can only be detected by artificial means. For this reason, this procedure has been associated with a lethargic state in nature when animals or plants appear, over a period, to be dead but then can wake up or prevail without suffering any harm. This has been termed in different contexts hibernation, dormancy or anabiosis (the latter in some aquatic invertebrates and plants in scarcity conditions).

In July 2020, marine biologists reported that aerobic microorganisms (mainly), in &quot;quasi-suspended animation&quot;, were found in organically-poor sediments, up to 101.5 million years old, below the sea floor in the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) (&quot;the deadest spot in the ocean&quot;), and could be the longest-living life forms ever found.

==Delayed resuscitation in humans==
This condition of apparent death or interruption of vital signs in humans may be similar to a medical interpretation of suspended animation. It is only possible to recover signs of life if the brain and other vital organs suffer no cell deterioration, necrosis or molecular death principally caused by oxygen deprivation or excess temperature (especially high temperature).

Cases have been reported of individuals having returned from this apparent interruption of life lasting over one half hour, two hours, eight hours, or more (while adhering to these specific conditions for oxygen and temperature) have been analysed in depth, but these cases are considered rare and unusual phenomena. The brain begins to die after five minutes without oxygen; nervous tissues die intermediately when a &quot;somatic death&quot; occurs while muscles die over one to two hours following this last condition.

It has been possible to obtain a successful resuscitation and recover life after apparent suspended animation in such instances as after anaesthesia, heat stroke, electrocution, narcotic poisoning, heart attack or cardiac arrest, shock, newborn infants, cerebral concussion, or cholera.

Supposedly, in suspended animation, a person technically would not die, as long as they were able to preserve the minimum conditions in an environment extremely close to death and return to a normal living state. An example of such a case is Anna Bågenholm, a Swedish radiologist who allegedly survived 80 minutes under ice in a frozen lake in a state of cardiac arrest with no brain damage in 1999. 

Other cases of hypothermia where people survived without damage are:
* John Smith, a 14-year-old boy who survived 15minutes under ice in a frozen lake before paramedics arrived to pull him onto dry land and saved him.
* Mitsutaka Uchikoshi, a Japanese man, was reported by media to have survived the cold for 24days in 2006 without food or water when he purportedly fell into a state similar to hibernation. This was doubted by some medical experts, claiming that surviving such a prolonged period without fluids was physiologically impossible.
* Paulie Hynek, who, at age two, survived several hours of hypothermia-induced cardiac arrest and whose body temperature reached .
* Erika Nordby, a toddler who in 2001 was revived after two hours without apparent heartbeat with a body temperature of about .

=== Human hibernation ===
It has been suggested that bone lesions provide evidence of hibernation among the early human population whose remains have been retrieved at the Archaeological site of Atapuerca. In a paper published in the journal &quot;L&#x27;Anthropologie&quot;, researchers Juan-Luis Arsuaga and Antonis Bartsiokas point out that &quot;primitive mammals and primates&quot; like bush babies and lorises hibernate, which suggests that &quot;the genetic basis and physiology for such a hypometabolism could be preserved in many mammalian species, including humans&quot;.

Since the 1970s, induced hypothermia has been performed for some open-heart surgeries as an alternative to heart-lung machines. Hypothermia, however, provides only a limited amount of time in which to operate and there is a risk of tissue and brain damage for prolonged periods.

There are many research projects currently investigating how to achieve &quot;induced hibernation&quot; in humans. This ability to hibernate humans would be useful for a number of reasons, such as saving the lives of seriously ill or injured people by temporarily putting them in a state of hibernation until treatment can be given.

The primary focus of research for human hibernation is to reach a state of torpor, defined as a gradual physiological inhibition to reduce oxygen demand and obtain energy conservation by hypometabolic behaviors altering biochemical processes. In previous studies, it was demonstrated that physiological and biochemical events could inhibit endogenous thermoregulation before the onset of hypothermia in a challenging process known as &quot;estivation&quot;. This is indispensable to survive harsh environmental conditions, as seen in some amphibians and reptiles.

== Scientific possibilities ==

=== Temperature-induced ===

Lowering the temperature of a substance reduces its chemical activity by the Arrhenius equation. This includes life processes such as metabolism. Cryonics could eventually provide long-term suspended animation.

==== Emergency Preservation and Resuscitation ====

Emergency Preservation and Resuscitation (EPR) is a way to slow the bodily processes that would lead to death in cases of severe injury. This involves lowering the body&#x27;s temperature below , which is the current standard for therapeutic hypothermia.

====Hypothermic experiments on animals====

In June 2005, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Safar Center for Resuscitation Research announced they had managed to place dogs in suspended animation and bring them back to life, most of them without brain damage, by draining the blood out of the dogs&#x27; bodies and injecting a low temperature solution into their circulatory systems, which in turn keeps the bodies alive in stasis. After three hours of being clinically dead, the dogs&#x27; blood was returned to their circulatory systems, and the animals were revived by delivering an electric shock to their hearts. The heart started pumping the blood around the body, and the dogs were brought back to life.

On 20 January 2006, doctors from the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston announced they had placed pigs in suspended animation with a similar technique. The pigs were anaesthetized and major blood loss was induced, along with simulated - via scalpel - severe injuries (e.g. a punctured aorta as might happen in a car accident or shooting). After the pigs lost about half their blood the remaining blood was replaced with a chilled saline solution. As the body temperature reached the damaged blood vessels were repaired and the blood was returned. The method was tested 200 times with a 90% success rate.

=== Chemically induced ===

The laboratory of Mark Roth at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and institutes such as Suspended Animation, Inc are trying to implement suspended animation as a medical procedure which involves the therapeutic induction to a complete and temporary systemic ischemia, directed to obtain a state of tolerance for the protection-preservation of the entire organism, this during a circulatory collapse &quot;only by a limited period of one hour&quot;. The purpose is to avoid a serious injury, risk of brain damage or death, until the patient reaches specialized attention.

<text>Rudolf &quot;Rudi&quot; Völler (; born 13 April 1960) is a German professional football manager and former player, who is currently the director of the Germany national team. In Germany, he is nicknamed &quot;Tante Käthe&quot; (&quot;Aunt Kathy&quot;), a name bestowed upon him by Thomas Berthold, and in Italy, he is nicknamed &quot;Il tedesco volante&quot; (&quot;The flying German&quot;) by supporters of Roma.

A forward, Völler began his professional career at Kickers Offenbach, before joining 1860 Munich, and he was top scorer of the 2. Bundesliga in the 1981–82 season. He went on to play for Werder Bremen, where he was noted for his consistent goalscoring, becoming the top scorer of the Bundesliga in the 1982–83 season. Völler moved abroad, firstly transferring to Serie A club Roma and then to Ligue 1 club Olympique Marseille. At Roma, he won the Coppa Italia and was runner-up of the UEFA Cup during the 1990–91 season; he was also top scorer of both these tournaments. At Marseille, he won the French title and the Champions League in the 1992–93 season, but following a match fixing scandal, the club were stripped of their league title and were relegated in 1994. The same year, Völler returned to his native country, ending his career at Bayer Leverkusen.

Völler made his debut for the Germany national team, then known as West Germany, in 1982. He represented his country at three FIFA World Cups and UEFA European Championships each, during a successful period for &quot;Die Nationalmannschaft&quot;. Völler played in two consecutive World Cup finals, both of which were against Argentina, and he won the trophy in 1990. At the time of his retirement in 1994, he was Germany&#x27;s second highest goalscorer behind Gerd Müller; he is now joint-fourth with Jürgen Klinsmann, having been surpassed by Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski.

After retiring as a player with Bayer Leverkusen, he became the sporting director of the club until 2000, where he was the interim manager for twelve matches, before being succeeded by Berti Vogts. He was then appointed caretaker manager of the Germany national team, despite his lack of coaching experience. In the wake of the drug scandal that involved the preferred choice of the DFB, Christoph Daum, Völler was ultimately kept on, and was able to lead Germany to the 2002 FIFA World Cup final, where they lost to Brazil. Along with Mário Zagallo, Franz Beckenbauer and Didier Deschamps, Völler has the distinction of reaching a World Cup final as both a player (1986 and 1990) and as a manager (2002). Following a group-stage exit at UEFA Euro 2004, Völler resigned as manager, after which he had a short-lived spell as manager of his former club Roma. He later returned to Leverkusen, where he was briefly interim manager again, and became the club&#x27;s sporting director for the second time, a position he held until 2022. In February 2023, he was appointed director of the Germany national team.

==Club career==
Völler started his career with 1860 Hanau, then played for second division sides Kickers Offenbach and TSV 1860 Munich, before joining Bundesliga club Werder Bremen in 1982, winning his first cap for West Germany that same year. Following a successful season in which he was the Bundesliga&#x27;s top scorer, foreign clubs became interested in the striker, and in 1987 he was transferred to Roma, where he became a mainstay of the team and earned the nickname &quot;er tedesco&quot; (&quot;the German&quot;) and also &quot;il tedesco volante&quot; (&quot;the flying German&quot;). He won the Coppa Italia in 1991 and was the club&#x27;s top scorer on several occasions.

In 1992, Roma decided to sell Völler to Marseille, where he was intended as replacement for superstar striker Jean-Pierre Papin. That also allowed Roma to add Claudio Caniggia as its third foreigner to the squad, so both parties were happy to let the deal go through. There, he won his biggest club honour in a very successful first season, thanks to the UEFA Champions League won with Marseille against AC Milan coached by Fabio Capello, in 1993 (1–0, goal scored by Basile Boli). Völler started the match, playing 78 minutes. Marseille was then caught in a bribery scandal, however, and was stripped of its 1993 league title, and were relegated despite a second-place finish in 1994. Völler scored 24 league goals for the club but departed after its relegation. Returning to Germany, he joined Bayer Leverkusen in 1994, where he ended his career as a player in 1996 and started a career in the management of the club.

==International career==
Völler was capped 90 times for the Germany national team, scoring 47 goals, including eight in World Cup final rounds.

Völler also played at three UEFA European Championships, starting with Euro 1984, where he scored twice in a group match against Romania which the Germans won 2–1. A 90th minute defeat against Spain in their next match, however, saw West Germany eliminated when all they needed was a draw.

At the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Völler scored the West Germans&#x27; equalizer in a 2–1 win over Scotland in the group stage. He bagged a last minute goal against France in the semi-final to seal a 2–0 win and in the final itself his 80th-minute goal made it 2–2 against Argentina. Germany had recovered from 2–0 down but eventually lost the match 3–2. Völler became the third player to score as a substitute in the World Cup final, after Dick Nanninga in 1978 and Alessandro Altobelli achieved this feat in 1982.

West Germany hosted the Euro 1988, and Völler scored twice in a 2–0 win over Spain but the hosts lost to eventual winners the Netherlands in the semi-final.

Völler was a member of the team that won the 1990 World Cup in Italy. He scored three times in the tournament, including one goal in a 4–1 win over Yugoslavia, and then found the net twice against the United Arab Emirates in a 5–1 win. During the second-round match against the Netherlands, Völler and Dutch player Frank Rijkaard were sent off the field after the Dutchman spat on Völler twice. In the semi-final against England, Völler limped off injured in the first half and was replaced by Karl-Heinz Riedle. However Völler recovered to start the final against Argentina, which Germany won 1–0 to claim their 3rd World Cup title.

The unsavoury incident that took place during the second-round match with the Netherlands started when Rijkaard was booked for a bad tackle on Völler. As Rijkaard took up position for the free kick, he spat in Völler&#x27;s hair. Völler complained to the referee and was booked as well. From the resulting free kick, a furious Völler then jumped up and punched the ball with his hand (although it looked like he had used his head) and then dived to avoid a collision with Dutch goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen, although it also looked as if he had dived for a penalty. Van Breukelen was angry at this, but Rijkaard again confronted Völler by twisting his ear and stamping on his foot. The temperamental and tough Argentine referee Juan Carlos Loustau finally had enough of Völler&#x27;s and Rijkaard&#x27;s antics and he sent both players off. Rijkaard then again spat in Völler&#x27;s hair as they left the pitch and was rumoured to have repeated this on the touchline. Rijkaard later stated that it was his fault: &quot;That day I was wrong. There was no insult. I always had much respect for Rudi Völler. But I went berserk when I saw that red card. I talked to him after the match and I apologized. I&#x27;m very happy that he accepted. I have no bad feeling about him now. We even posed for a very funny advert together, years after.&quot; (Rijkaard had family problems in this time).

Völler was again selected for the Euro 1992 but was sent home when he suffered an injury in the opening game with CIS.

At the 1994 World Cup, Völler was kept out of the starting line up for all three group games by Jürgen Klinsmann and Karl-Heinz Riedle who scored five between them. He made just one sub appearance in the group stages. He did start the second round tie with Belgium and scored twice in a 3–2 win.

==Managerial career==

After a disappointing Euro 2000 for Germany under manager Erich Ribbeck, the German Football Association (DFB) appointed Völler as new manager, accepting his lack of coaching qualifications at the time. Initially, he only planned to take interimistic responsibility for one year, following the decision by Bayer 04 Leverkusen and Völler himself (as sporting director of the club) not to make Christoph Daum step down from the national team before 2001. However, Völler extended his contract due to good results, after Daum became involved in a controversial drug scandal. Despite losing to England 5–1 at home and two disappointing draws against Finland during qualification, he managed to lead the team to a surprising appearance in the final of the 2002 World Cup against Brazil.

After a group-stage exit from Euro 2004, he resigned from his post. Following his resignation from the German national job, Völler briefly made a comeback at Roma in 2004 as manager. Hired in late August as a last-minute appointment after the shock resignation of Cesare Prandelli, he left the club only one month later after a series of poor results and high-profile disagreements with players, notably Antonio Cassano. He only signed a one-year contract to allow a return of Prandelli the next year, but presided over only one draw and two defeats in the league.

Moving back to the support ranks at Bayer Leverkusen, Völler was named caretaker manager of Leverkusen on 16 September 2005 after the club sacked coach Klaus Augenthaler. Völler served in that role until Michael Skibbe was named as the club&#x27;s new permanent coach that October. After the arrival of Skibbe, Völler was promoted to become for the second time sports director at Leverkusen.

Völler was (and still is) very popular in Germany. Even when the national squad achieved only modest results, Völler never lost his popularity as the German public knew he was achieving as much as possible with a relatively limited squad. His predecessor Berti Vogts, by contrast, was widely criticised, even during periods of success with a far more talented German squad. The public even forgave Völler when – during a TV interview after a 0–0 draw against Iceland in September 2003 – he lost his temper and yelled at the presenter Waldemar Hartmann in order to defend his team against, what he thought was, unfair press statements.

On 1 February 2023, Völler became the director of the Germany national team. On 10 September 2023, following the sacking of Hansi Flick, Völler was named as interim manager of the national team for their friendly against France, which Germany won 2–1.

==Personal life==
He has two children from German ex wife Angela; one of them is Marco, a basketball executive and professional player. Later on in 1995, he married a local woman from Rome during his stay in Italy, adopting her daughter from a previous relationship and having one more son with her.

<doc id="354090" wikidata="Q1029135" url="?curid=354090" title="Nettwerk Music Group">
<text>Nettwerk Music Group is an independent record label founded in 1984. 

The Vancouver-based company was created by principals Terry McBride and Mark Jowett as a record label to distribute recordings by the band Moev, but the label expanded in Canada and internationally. Initially specializing in electronic music including alternative dance and industrial, the label expanded its roster to include pop, rock and numerous singer-songwriters in the late 1980s and 1990s. Early artists included Coldplay, Sarah McLachlan, and Barenaked Ladies.

In 2023, Nettwerk recapitalized to invest in catalog acquisitions and artist investments. The label was named in Billboard’s Indie Power Players list in 2024.

==History==
In 1984, Terry McBride and his friend Mark Jowett attended — and both dropped out of — the University of British Columbia. McBride had studied civil engineering while Jowett took classes in creative writing, theater and English. The two met at a house party where Jowett&#x27;s electronic music band Moev was performing.

Once out of college, McBride began managing Moev, for whom Jowett played guitar. Moev was signed to Go Records, a small San Francisco label that went bankrupt, leaving the band without distribution. They&#x27;d spend time at his small apartment with friends such as the members of the electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy, and soon he and Jowett starting putting out their records, along with Moev&#x27;s and The Grapes of Wrath.

McBride had previously started a label, Noetix, and though it was unsuccessful, he and Jowett were willing to give the record business another try. The company officially opened its doors in 1985. Their first release was The Grapes of Wrath&#x27;s self-titled EP followed by their full-length, &quot;September Bowl of Green&quot;. It piqued the attention of Capitol Records, and paved the way for a distribution deal for the band and Nettwerk as a label in 1986. Also in 1986, Nettwerk brought on Ric Arboit as a third partner and managing director.

Despite having an eclectic initial roster of artists, Nettwerk gained a reputation as an industrial dance label, an assumption bolstered by the label&#x27;s roster of homegrown and licensed industrial acts including Skinny Puppy, Severed Heads, SPK, Manufacture, and Single Gun Theory. On this point, George Maniatis, one of the label&#x27;s early promotion managers, stated: Remission&#x27; (Skinny Puppy&#x27;s mini-album), which was one of our first releases, grabbed everybody by the you-know-whats... Because of it, everybody assumed we were just industrial dance. But we never set out in that direction — It&#x27;s just that they hit first.&quot;

Regardless of intent, the industrial dance and electronic genres proved lucrative and resulted in many international cross-licensing deals. Among them: Belgium&#x27;s Play It Again Sam label running the Nettwerk Europe imprint in exchange for Nettwerk licensing Front 242 in Canada; licensing Tackhead&#x27;s North American distribution rights from England&#x27;s On-U Sound; and cross-licensing with Australia&#x27;s Volition label which brought Severed Heads and Single Gun Theory to North America. Cross-licensing, including distribution through the majors (Capitol for Skinny Puppy and Atlantic for Moev), and respectable club chart performances (including singles by Manufacture, Severed Heads, and Moev) all contributed to significant visibility and growth for the label at the close of the 1980s.

The label&#x27;s reputation as a strictly electronic dance imprint would soon change. At a show in Halifax, McBride met nineteen-year-old singer-songwriter named Sarah McLachlan – he&#x27;d been introduced to her music through Jowett, and tried to recruit her to front Moev. Her parents initially rejected the idea, saying she was too young, but by then she had her moved out of her parents home and rented an apartment down the street while in her first year of art school. McBride offered McLachlan a five-record deal, and she agreed, saying “Ok. Sure. Why not?&quot;

At this point, McBride and Jowett had moved Nettwerk into a new office, and McLachlan relocated to Vancouver to write, finishing her debut, &quot;Touch&quot;, in 1988. The first single, &quot;Vox&quot;, was a hit, and led to her signing a worldwide deal with Arista Records (Nettwerk retained her for Canada). She followed up with &quot;Solace&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; in 1993. &quot;Surfacing&quot; in 1997 contained two hit singles: &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;, and winning two Grammy Awards.

In 1994, Nettwerk switched its distribution from Capitol–EMI to Sony Music, later Sony BMG.

Lilith Fair was initially McLachlan&#x27;s idea; she was tired of the standard touring, and wanted to do something different, something inventive. Though McBride was resistant at first, he pushed forward, and they assembled a lineup that they then were told was &quot;suicidal&quot;: Paula Cole, Aimee Mann, Patti Smith, Lisa Loeb and McLachlan to close. It was a success, and the next summer they launched a touring version; it grossed $16 million, a large portion of which was donated to women&#x27;s charities. Founded by McLachlan, McBride, Nettwerk co-owner Dan Fraser and New York talent agent Marty Diamond, Lilith Fair was the top-grossing festival tour of 1997 and ranked 16th among the year&#x27;s Top 100 Tours. In 1998, Lilith Fair grossed just over $6 million and remained the top-grossing summer concert package tour of the season.

Nettwerk then signed Barenaked Ladies, at the time viewed as a novelty act. After steady radio promotion, McBride booked the band for a show at City Hall Plaza in Boston to launch their album &quot;Stunt&quot;. The concert drew 80,000 fans, and the first single, &quot;One Week&quot;, reached number one on the charts, also earning the band a Grammy nomination and a Juno Award for Best Pop Album. They have since gone on to sell over 10 million albums.

Nettwerk brought on Dido in 1999, as well as Sum 41. Avril Lavigne was sixteen when she walked into the Nettwerk offices; Arista had sent her to McBride, hoping to figure out what to make of her. Though Lavigne would release her records through Arista, she continued with Nettwerk for her management.

In 2000, EMI decided against a North American release for Coldplay&#x27;s debut album &quot;Parachutes&quot;, which was distributed by subsidiary Parlophone in the United Kingdom. This led Nettwerk to pick up the album and make it available in Canada and the United States.

Nettwerk embraced new digital formats. McBride studied reports showing the sea change in fan preference, and realized that he&#x27;d rather cater to the growing MP3 culture rather than work against it. In 2005, Nettmusic became one of the first major music companies to sell MP3s free of DRM (digital rights management), and supported the consumer case in the battle against the Recording Industry Association of America. Nettwerk has offered to pay the legal fees of a teenager in Texas who is being sued for downloading songs.

At the same time, Nettwerk continued to focus on other new, innovative and both artist-and-fan friendly models. McBride conceived of a concept he called &quot;collapsed copyright&quot;, set to revolve around a new business model that empowered artists themselves and not just the corporations. The premise allowed artists to release music under their own label (therefore retaining the intellectual property), marketed and promoted through Nettwerk.

On June 9, 2010, Nettwerk announced that for its distribution and marketing in the United States, it would depart from Sony Music and its catalogue would now be distributed by WMG&#x27;s Alternative Distribution Alliance. In 2013, Nettwerk raised $10.25 million in equity financing to sign artists and purchase catalogs.

In July 2016, Nettwerk sold its publishing catalog to KobaltInvestment Fund, an independent investment fund established in 2011.

In September 2017, Nettwerk Records announced that The Ballroom Thieves joined the label roster.

==Nutone==
In 2008, Nettwerk founder Terry McBride revived a retired sub-label of Nettwerk called Nutone Records, with the objective of releasing devotional, chant and world music. He also launched a chain of wellness centers in Canada called YYoga.

<text>The Ladbroke Grove rail crash (also known as the Paddington rail crash) was a rail accident which occurred on 5 October 1999 at Ladbroke Grove in London, England, when a Thames Trains-operated passenger train passed a signal at danger, colliding almost head-on with a First Great Western-operated passenger train. With 31 people killed and 417 injured, it was one of the worst rail accidents in 20th-century British history.

It was the second major crash on the Great Western Main Line in just over two years, the first being the Southall rail crash of September 1997, a few miles west of this crash. Both crashes would have been prevented by an operational automatic train protection (ATP) system, wider fitting of which had been rejected on cost grounds. The crash severely damaged public confidence in the management and regulation of safety of Britain&#x27;s privatised railway system.

A public inquiry into the crash by Lord Cullen was held in 2000. Since both the Paddington and Southall crashes had reopened public debate on ATP, a separate joint inquiry considering the issue in the light of both crashes was also held in 2000; it confirmed the rejection of ATP and the mandatory adoption of a cheaper and less effective system, but noted a mismatch between public opinion and cost-benefit analysis. Major changes in the formal responsibilities for management and regulation of safety of UK rail transport ensued.

==Incident==

At 08:06 BST on 5 October 1999, a British Rail Class 165 &quot;Turbo&quot; diesel multiple unit or DMU, No. 165 115, left Paddington Station on a Thames Trains service to Bedwyn railway station in Wiltshire, driven by 31-year-old Michael Hodder. From Paddington to Ladbroke Grove Junction (about to the west), the lines were bi-directional (signalled to allow trains to travel in either direction, in and out of the platforms of Paddington Station); beyond Ladbroke Grove the main line from London to South Wales and the West of England is a more conventional layout of two lines in each direction (&#x27;up&#x27; for travel to London, &#x27;down&#x27; for travel away from London) carrying both fast and slow trains.

Being an outbound train, it would have been routed onto the down main line at Ladbroke Grove. It should have been held at a red signal at Portobello Junction until it could be rerouted safely. Instead, it passed the signal; and the points directed the multiple unit onto the Up Main Line at Ladbroke Grove. At about 8:09, as it was entering the Up Line, it collided nearly head-on and at a combined speed of approximately with the 06:03 First Great Western train from Cheltenham to Paddington.

The 06:03 InterCity 125 high speed train (HST) was driven by 52-year-old Brian Cooper. It consisted of a rake of eight Mark 3 coaches with a Class 43 diesel power car at each end, here led by No. 43 011. The chassis and body of the HST are notably stronger than the structure of the Class 165 DMU, the leading car of which was totally destroyed. The diesel fuel it was carrying was dispersed by the collision and ignited, leading to a series of fires in the wreckage, particularly in coach H near the front of the HST, which was completely burnt out.

The drivers of both trains were killed, as well as 29 others (23 on the Class 165, five on the HST as a result of the impact, with a further fatality as a result of the fire), and 417 people were injured.

==Immediate cause==
The immediate cause of the disaster was determined to be the Class 165 passing a red signal (numbered SN109 on gantry 8 overhead beside four signals serving other tracks) at which the train should have been stopped. The signal was displaying a red aspect, and the preceding signal a single yellow which should have alerted the driver of the red signal ahead. Since Hodder, the driver, was killed in the collision, it was not possible to establish why he had passed the signal at danger. However, Hodder was inexperienced, having qualified as a driver only two weeks before the crash. His driver training was found to be defective on at least two grounds: assessing situation-handling skills, and being notified of recent local incidents of signals passed at danger (SPAD). The local signals were known to have caused other near misses – SN109 had been passed at danger on eight occasions in six years, but Hodder had no specific warning of this. Furthermore, 5 October 1999 was a clear day and at just past 08:00 the sun would have been low, behind Hodder, meaning that sunlight would reflect off yellow aspects, reducing visibility. The driver of a previous westbound train reported that &quot;all the signals right the way across all lit up like a Christmas tree&quot; at gantry 6 at about 7:50 that morning. Poor signal placement meant that Hodder would have seen the reflection of the yellow aspects of SN109 at a point where his view of the red aspect (but not of any other signal on the gantry) was still obstructed. The inquiry considered it more probable than not that the poor visibility of SN109, caused by not only its own position but the positioning of other signals at gantry 8, along with the reflections of sunlight, led Hodder to believe that he was able to proceed and pass the red signal.

==Contributory factors==
The inquiry noted that the lines out of and into Paddington were known to be prone to SPAD mishapshosting an unusual concentration of eight SPADs at signal SN109 in the preceding six yearsand attempted to identify the underlying causes.

===Problems with signal visibility===
Paddington approaches had been resignalled by British Rail in the early 1990s to allow bidirectional working. The number of signals and limited trackside space meant that most signals were in gantries over the tracks; the curvature of the lines meant that it was not always obvious which signal was for which track. Reflective line-identification signs had therefore been added but, the inquiry report noted, &quot;they were closer to the signal to the right hand side than to the signal for the line to which they related&quot;. However, misreading of which signal related to which track cannot have caused the fatal crash, because at the time all the other gantry 8 signals westbound were also showing red.
Local spacing between signals and points was designed to allow fast through-running by freight trains, such that gantry 8 was less than west of a road bridge not at high level; this compromised the distance from which the signal could be seen by drivers of trains leaving Paddington. To allow the higher (&#x27;proceed&#x27;) aspects to be seen sooner, the standard signals (with the four aspects arranged vertically) were replaced with non-standard &#x27;reverse L&#x27; signals, with the red aspect to the left of the lower yellow. The resignalling had been implemented ahead of formal HMRI approval; awaited at the time of the crash.

The line had been electrified to allow the new Heathrow Express service to operate from 1994 with overhead electrification equipment that further obstructed drivers&#x27; view of signals:

... from the outset there was not an adequate overall consideration of the difficulties which would face drivers, in particular in signal sighting, on which the safety of travellers critically depended. Secondly, when difficulties did emerge, there was not an adequate reconsideration of the scheme. There was a resistance to questioning what had already been done. Cost, delay and interference with the performance objectives underlay that resistance.

The red aspect of SN109 was particularly badly obscured by the overhead electrification equipment; it was last of all the gantry 8 signal aspects to become clearly visible to the driver of a Class 165 approaching from Paddington.

===Problems with signal visibility management===
All new or altered signals or which had multiple SPADs should have been reviewed for sighting issues by a &#x27;signal sighting committee&#x27;, but none had been held for signals around Paddington since Railtrack assumed responsibility for this in April 1994. An internal audit in March 1999 had reported this, but a follow-up audit in September 1999 found no evidence of any remedial action being taken.

The failure to have signal sighting committees convened was persistent and serious. It was due ... to a combination of incompetent management and inadequate process, the latter consisting in the absence of a process at a higher level for identifying whether those who were responsible for convening such committees were or were not doing so.

There had been over the years a number of proposals or recommendations for the risk assessment of the signalling in the Paddington area; none of them was carried into effect. Multiple SPADs at SN109 in August 1998 should have triggered a risk assessment; none took place. An inquiry into a February 1998 SPAD at SN109 had already recommended risk assessment of signalling on the Paddington–Ladbroke Grove bi-directional lines; this and many other inquiry recommendations had not been implemented: the Railtrack employee with formal responsibility for action-tracking had been told his responsibility ended once someone accepted an action, and did not extend to checking that they had acted upon it.

===&#x27;Disjointed and ineffective&#x27; SPAD reduction initiatives===
Between February 1998 and the accident there had been four separate groups set up with the aim of reducing SPADs; their existence, membership and functions overlapped. A Railtrack manager told the inquiry how he struggled on his arrival in October 1998 to understand how &quot;so many apparently good people could produce so little action&quot;: people had burdens that were too complex; they were not prioritising; people were &quot;square pegs in round holes&quot;; some were not competent; and, in summary, &quot;the culture of the place had gone seriously adrift over many years&quot;. The chief executive of Railtrack spoke of a seemingly endemic culture of complacency and inaction, which he said reflected the culture of the old British Rail:
&quot;The culture is one in which decisions are delegated upwards. There has been little empowerment. People have tended to manage reactively, not proactively. The basic management discipline of &#x27;plan-do-review&#x27; is absent the further down the organisation one goes.&quot;

===Problems with driver training===
Thames Trains inherited a driver training programme from British Rail, which had changed to the point where in February 1999, a concerned incoming training manager commissioned an external audit which reported

The trainers did not appear to be following the training course syllabus and supporting notes as they considered these to be &#x27;not fit for purpose&#x27; with inappropriate time allowances for some sessions. The traction and introduction to driving section of the course has been extended and the six week route learning session is being used as additional practical handling.

Indeed, Michael Hodder&#x27;s 16 weeks&#x27; practical training had been given by a trainer who felt that &quot;I was not there to teach ... the routes. I was totally to teach ... how to drive a Turbo&quot;; the training manager was unaware of this. Details of signals which had been repeatedly passed at danger should have been supplied to trainers and passed on to trainees; no trainer had done so, and the practical trainer quoted above was unaware that SN109 was a multi-SPAD signal. Testing of trainees was similarly unstructured and unstandardised, with no clear pass/fail criteria. Under the previous British Railways training regime, trainees would have spent far longer in training and once qualified, were not allowed to drive over the notoriously difficult approach to/from Paddington until they had at least two years&#x27; experience on less complex routes. Hodder had only qualified 13 days earlier; he was ex-navy with no previous experience as a railway worker, but no special attention was paid to this in either training or testing.

It must be concluded therefore that [the driver&#x27;s] training was not adequate for the task for which he was being prepared. The very favourable comments made as to his progress by his various teachers have to be viewed against the background that his teachers were working with a less than perfect training programme.

==Other issues==

===Train protection===
The Class 165 unit had been fitted with an Automatic Warning System (AWS) which required the driver to acknowledge a warning every time he approached a signal not at green. If an Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system had been fitted and working it would have automatically applied brakes to prevent the train going beyond any signal at red. National adoption of ATP, British Rail&#x27;s preferred train protection system, had been recommended after the Clapham Junction rail crash, but later abandoned because the safety benefits were considered not great enough to justify the cost. After a previous SPAD, Thames Trains had commissioned a cost–benefit analysis (CBA) study specific to the Paddington situation which came to the same conclusion. The Ladbroke Grove accident was felt to cast doubt on the wisdom of these decisions. However, the Cullen inquiry confirmed that CBA would not support the adoption of ATP by Thames Trains.

===Flank protection===
The signalling system on the approaches to Paddington did not incorporate &#x27;flank protection&#x27; (where the points beyond a stop signal are automatically set to direct the train away from the path which would cause a collision). This would have routed the train running past SN109 onto the Down Relief line. This should have been considered at the design stage. The reasons for not engineering flank protection were not known but it was noted that the introduction of Automatic Train Protection (ATP) had been thought to be imminent at previous safety reviews. Flank protection would have increased the &#x27;overlap&#x27; (the distance for which a train could run past the signal before fouling lines) at SN109; the desirability of doing so should have been considered by the risk assessment which had not taken place.

===Response of signalmen===
The written instructions for Railtrack signalling centre staff at Slough were that as soon as they realised that a train had passed a signal at danger they should set signals to danger and immediately send a radio &quot;emergency all stop&quot; signal to the driver of the train by Cab Secure Radio (CSR) as soon as they realised that it had done so. In the event, only when the Thames train was past the signal did they start to send a radio &quot;emergency all stop&quot; signal (it is not clear whether the signal was actually sent before the crash). Their understanding of the instructions was that they should wait to see if the driver stopped of his own accord before attempting to contact him; this interpretation was supported by their immediate manager. The signalmen had never been trained in the use of CSR, nor had they ever used it in response to a SPAD.
The general picture which emerged was of a slack and complacent regime, which was not alive to the potentially dire consequences of a SPAD or of the way in which signallers could take action to deal with such situations.

===Regulatory shortcomings===
The Health and Safety Executive&#x27;s HM Railway Inspectorate was also criticised for its inspection procedures.
The then head of HSE told the Inquiry the HSE were concerned about, first, the length of time taken for the approval of the signalling scheme; secondly, the slow progress by Railtrack and the HMRI in bringing issues to a conclusion; and, thirdly, the inadequate risk analysis. Matters had not been followed up with more urgency. More could have been done to enforce health and safety legislation. She attributed these deficiencies to three causes:
* a lack of resources on the part of the HMRI;
* a lack of vigour by the HMRI in pursuing issues; and
* the placing of too much trust in the duty holders

==Wider ramifications==

===National policy on train protection systems===
A fortnight before the crash the HSE had announced an intention to require the adoption of TPWS (an upgrade of AWS, which could stop trains travelling at less than 70 mph within the overlap distance of a red signal delivering it assessed about the safety benefits of ATP at much lower cost) by 2004 (advanced, a week after the crash, to 2003).

The separate joint inquiry on the problem nationally noted that ATP and contrasting AWS introduced since about 1958 (and therefore TPWS) had continuing reliability problems and were obsolescent technology inconsistent with the impending standardisation EU-wide per the ETCS European Train Control System. In the year between Ladbroke Grove and the joint inquiry the rail industry (if not the general public) had become largely committed to the adoption of TPWS. Consequently, although the joint inquiry expressed &quot;considerable reservations about the effectiveness of TPWS&quot; it concurred with its adoption.

The joint inquiry noted that &quot;public reaction to catastrophic rail accidents ... should be and is taken into account in the making of decisions about rail safety&quot; but did not align with the output of CBA (cost-benefits analysis). &quot;Any future ATP system will entail expenditure at levels many times higher than that indicated by any approach based upon CBA. Despite its cost, there appears to be a general consensus in favour of ATP&quot;. Both TPWS and ETCS would be mandatory and therefore their cost implications need not be considered by any body other than the UK government and the EU Commission.

===Management and regulation of rail safety===
The inquiry noted evidence that railway safety statistics had not worsened after privatisation, nor had there been any evidence that however privatisation had been carried out it would have been detrimental to safety. Concerns were however expressed about how privatisation had been carried out:
* The fragmentation of the industry had created numerous, complex interfaces exacerbated by defensive or insular attitudes (expected to worsen in the future as managers who had broad, sobering experience in BR passed out of the system). It also gave problems with the management, development and implementation of large-scale projects; and meant that little real research and development was being carried out.
* The quality of safety leadership and communications varied between the various successor organisations.
* A stress on performance targets had diluted the perceived importance of safety. Cullen contrasted multimillion-pound penalties for poor punctuality with much lower fines for serious safety breaches.
* Train Operating Company (TOC) franchises had been awarded for too short a period, and with inadequate consideration of safety aspects.
* Railtrack relied extensively on contractors to carry out safety critical work; there were too many contracting organisations, contracts were for too short a period, and were inadequately supervised by Railtrack.

Beyond exhortations to do better, the Inquiry recommended changes in the industry structure.
Railtrack had not merely had responsibility for railways infrastructure, but also a lead responsibility for safety: for acceptance of the Safety Case of each TOC and for setting &quot;Railway Group Standards&quot; (system-wide standards on matters affecting safety). Since it also had commercial interests in these issues TOCs were unhappy with this: Cullen recommended that safety case acceptance should be directly by HSE in future, and a new body should be set up to manage Railway Group Standards.

In 1996 ScotRail had initiated the creation of a confidential rail safety reporting system (later to become CIRAS) formed from an independent panel chiefly from Strathclyde University. Other TOCs expressed interest and others in Scotland voluntarily joined the system. Following the Ladbroke Grove rail crash, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott mandated that all mainline rail in the UK come under the Confidential Incident Reporting &amp; Analysis System (CIRAS) to involve every rail employee in the rail safety process. CIRAS now provides services to all rail workers and operating sectors throughout England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland (ROI).

The Railways Inspectorate had a responsibility for advising on and inspecting against matters affecting railway safety; they were also the usual investigating body for serious railway crashes. Cullen felt that there was &quot;a strong argument for an investigating body which enjoys real and perceived independence&quot; and therefore recommended that rail accident investigation should become the responsibility of a separate body.

==Aftermath==

The recommendations of Lord Cullen&#x27;s inquiry into the crash led to the creation in 2003 of the Rail Safety and Standards Board and in 2005 of the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, in addition to the Railway Inspectorate. Standards-setting, accident investigation and regulatory functions were from then on clearly separated, on the model of the aviation industry.

On 5 April 2004, Thames Trains was fined a record £2million after admitting violations of health and safety law in connection with the crash and ordered to pay £75,000 in legal costs.

On 31 October 2006, Network Rail (the successor body to Railtrack, formed in the wake of a subsequent train crash at Hatfield) pleaded guilty to charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 in relation to the accident. It was fined £4million on 30 March 2007 and ordered to pay £225,000 in legal costs.

Signal SN109 was brought back into service in February 2006. It and many other signals in the Paddington area are now single-lens type signals.

A memorial garden and cenotaph has been created, partially overlooking the site, accessible from a supermarket car park, at .

Heavy damage to power car 43011 saw it written off, officially withdrawn in November. After the completion of the inquiry it was cut up by Sims Metals in Crewe, Cheshire in June 2002. The Turbo unit was written off, the front two cars were scrapped; the rear car was undamaged, able to be used for spare parts.

In a subsequent case arising out of a manslaughter committed by one of the victims of the crash, Kerrie Gray, who experienced post-traumatic stress disorder and went on to kill a pedestrian, legal issues were raised regarding the legal principle known as &quot;ex turpi causa non oritur actio&quot;, which holds that illegal actions cannot form a basis for damages claims. Mr Gray was found guilty of the offence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, and detained in psychiatric care as a result. He then sued Thames Trains, along with Network Rail, seeking compensation for the loss of the earnings which he should have earned to date and might have subsequently have earned if he had not committed the offence and consequently been detained. The High Court initially, and the House of Lords on appeal, held in support of Thames Trains and Network Rail that:

Pam Warren wrote the book &quot;From Behind the Mask&quot; which narrates her experiences during the crash, her recovery, and how it has affected her life and relationships.

<doc id="354096" wikidata="Q7005306" url="?curid=354096" title="New America (organization)">
<text>New America, formerly the New America Foundation, is an American liberal think tank founded in 1999. It focuses on a range of public policy issues, including national security, technology, health, gender, energy, education, and the economy. The organization is based in Washington, D.C., and Oakland, California. Anne-Marie Slaughter is the think tank&#x27;s chief executive officer.

==History==
New America was founded in 1999 by Ted Halstead, Sherle Schwenninger, Michael Lind, and Walter Russell Mead as the New America Foundation. The organization is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and also has offices in Oakland, California and Chicago, Illinois.

Ted Halstead served as New America&#x27;s founding president and CEO from 1999 to 2007. Steve Coll served as New America&#x27;s second president, before being succeeded by Anne-Marie Slaughter in 2013.

On June 27, 2017, Barry C. Lynn, the director of the anti-monopoly Open Markets program at New America, issued a statement, criticizing Google, one of the organization&#x27;s main sponsors. On August 30, 2017, it became known that Lynn was fired, and the Open Markets program was closed. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, New America did it to please Google. In response to the decision to fire Lynn and his team, 25 former and current employees of the think tank signed a letter expressing concern about the extent to which sponsors are influencing New America&#x27;s work.

Google reportedly made New America take this action because the researchers, including prominent young competition law scholar Lina Khan, had lauded the EU&#x27;s antitrust ruling against Google. New America&#x27;s president Anne-Marie Slaughter denied the allegations of improper influence by Google.

The foundation&#x27;s Economic Growth Program, directed by New America co-founders Sherle Schwenninger and Michael Lind, aims to take a policy look at America and the world&#x27;s economic problems. In 2011, the program commissioned a paper &quot;The Way Forward: Moving From the Post-Bubble, Post-Bust Economy to Renewed Growth and Competitiveness&quot;.

Maya MacGuineas, who has worked at the Brookings Institution as well as on Wall Street, led the committee and now leads Fix the Debt. After advising politicians from both parties, she serves as a trusted mediator on budget talks between Democrats and Republicans. In addition, in 2010, the committee&#x27;s policy director, Marc Goldwein, joined President Obama&#x27;s bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.

==Political stance==
In 2002, &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s Howard Fineman called New America a &quot;hive of state-of-the-art policy entrepreneurship&quot;. New America has been characterized as &quot;liberal&quot; by the &quot;Pacific Standard&quot; online magazine, &quot;left-leaning&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;left-of-center&quot; by the Capital Research Center organization.

==Open Technology Institute==
The Open Technology Institute (OTI) is the technology program of the New America Foundation. OTI formulates policy and regulatory reforms to support open architectures and open-source innovations and facilitates the development and implementation of open technologies and communications networks.

=== Commotion Wireless ===

Commotion Wireless is an open source &quot;device-as-infrastructure&quot; communication platform that integrates users&#x27; existing cell phones, Wi-Fi-enabled computers, and other wireless-capable devices to create community- and metro-scale, peer-to-peer communications networks. The project has been described as the &quot;Internet in a Suitcase&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===Red Hook Wi-Fi===
Founded in 2011 through a collaboration with OTI and Commotion Wireless, Red Hook Wi-Fi is a mesh network which services residents of Red Hook, Brooklyn, in New York City. The Wi-Fi network reached prominence in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy shut down many internet and communication systems throughout the city, but Red Hook remained connected through its mesh network.

==Assets and funding==
As of 2024, the New America had net assets of $56,424,720. Top donors to the organization have included the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Ford Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation.

<text>The TI-92 series are a line of graphing calculators produced by Texas Instruments. They include: the TI-92 (1995), the TI-92 II (1996), the TI-92 Plus (1998, 1999) and the Voyage 200 (2002). The design of these relatively large calculators includes a QWERTY keyboard. Because of this keyboard, it was given the status of a &quot;computer&quot; rather than &quot;calculator&quot; by American testing facilities and cannot be used on tests such as the SAT or AP Exams while the similar TI-89 can be.

==TI-92==
The TI-92 was originally released in 1995, and was the first symbolic calculator made by Texas Instruments. It came with a computer algebra system (CAS) based on Derive, geometry based on Cabri II, and was one of the first calculators to offer 3D graphing. The TI-92 was not allowed on most standardized tests due mostly to its QWERTY keyboard. Its larger size was also rather cumbersome compared to other graphing calculators. In response to these concerns, Texas Instruments introduced the TI-89 which is functionally similar to the original TI-92, but featured Flash ROM and 188 KB RAM, and a smaller design without the QWERTY keyboard. The TI-92 was then replaced by the TI-92 Plus, which was essentially a TI-89 with the larger QWERTY keyboard design of the TI-92. Eventually, TI released the Voyage 200, which is a smaller, lighter version of the TI-92 Plus with more Flash ROM.
The TI-92 is no longer sold through TI or its dealers, and is very hard to come by in stores.

==TI-92 II==
The TI-92 II was released in 1996, and was the first successor to the TI-92. 
The TI-92 II was available both as a stand-alone product, and as a user-installable II module which could be added to original TI-92 units to gain most of the feature improvements. The TI-92 II module was introduced early in 1996 and added the choice of 5 user languages (English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) and an additional 128k User memory. Along with the TI-92, the TI-92 II was replaced by the TI-92 Plus in 1999, which offered even more Flash ROM and RAM.

==TI-92 Plus==
The TI-92 Plus (or TI-92+) was released in 1998, slightly after the creation of the almost-identical (in terms of software) TI-89, while physically looking exactly like its predecessor, the TI-92 (which lacked flash memory). Besides increased memory over its predecessor, the TI-92 Plus also featured a sharper &quot;black&quot; screen, which had first appeared on the TI-89 and which eases viewing.

The TI-92 Plus was available both as a stand-alone product, and as a user-installable Plus module which could be added to original TI-92 and TI-92 II units to gain most of the feature improvements, most notably Flash Memory. A stand-alone TI-92 Plus calculator was functionally similar to the HW2 TI-89, while a module-upgraded TI-92 was functionally similar to the HW1 TI-89. Both versions could run the same releases of operating system software.

As of 2002, the TI-92 Plus was succeeded by the Voyage 200 and is no longer sold through TI or its dealers.

The TI-92 Plus is now available in an online emulator, featuring a list of frequently used commands.

==Voyage 200==
Voyage 200 (also V200 and Voyage 200 PLT) was released in 2002, being the replacement for the TI-92 Plus, with its only hardware upgrade over that calculator being an increase in the amount of flash memory available (2.7 megabytes for the Voyage 200 vs. 702 kilobytes for the TI-92 Plus). It also features a somewhat smaller and more rounded case design.

Like its predecessor, Voyage 200 is an advanced calculator that supports plotting multiple functions on the same graph, parametric, polar, 3D, and differential equation graphing as well as sequence representations. Its symbolic calculation system is based on a trimmed version of the calculation software Derive. In addition to its algebra and calculus capabilities, the Voyage 200 is packaged with list, spreadsheet, and data processing applications and can perform curve fitting to a number of standard functions and other statistical analysis operations. The calculator can also run most programs written for the TI-89 and TI-92 as well as programs specifically written for it. A large number of applications, ranging from games to interactive periodic tables can be found online.

The V200 is easily mistaken for a PDA or a small computer because of its large enclosure and its full QWERTY keyboard — a feature which disqualifies the calculator for use in many tests and examinations, including the American ACT and SAT. The TI-89 Titanium offers exactly the same functionality in a smaller format that is also legal on the SAT test, but not the ACT test.

<text>Neuberger Berman Group LLC is an American private, independent, employee-owned investment management firm. The firm manages equities, fixed income, private equity and hedge fund portfolios for global institutional investors, advisors and high-net-worth individuals.

==Overview==
Founded in 1939, Neuberger Berman is a privately held asset management firm, which is 100% owned by its employees. It serves pension plans, charitable organizations, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions, as well as high-net-worth individuals and mutual fund investors, both directly and through financial intermediaries and other partners. The firm has a broad range of investment capabilities, which have enabled it to win numerous public strategic partnership mandates with both leading institutional pension plans and major financial institutions. For its private clients, Neuberger Berman also provides financial planning, fiduciary services, and trust services.

Neuberger Berman manages US$474 billion in client assets .

==History==
The firm was co-founded in 1939 by Roy Neuberger (also an art collector and patron) and banker Robert Berman. 

=== Lehman Brothers acquisition and bankruptcy ===
In July 2003, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm&#x27;s acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities, or approximately 26 times earnings. That transaction closed in October 2003 and from that time, until 2008, Neuberger Berman served as one of the asset management arms of Lehman Brothers’ Investment Management Division. In that same year, Lehman acquired fixed income manager Lincoln Capital Fixed Income Management and private equity manager Crossroads Group.

===Management buyout===
On September 15, 2008, virtually unprecedented volatility in global securities markets resulted in Lehman Brothers’ collapse and bankruptcy filing. Neuberger Berman continued to operate, notwithstanding Lehman&#x27;s bankruptcy and sought opportunities to spin itself off from its parent. On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell its asset management businesses, including Neuberger Berman, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman &amp; Friedman. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009; however, a competing bid was entered by the firm&#x27;s management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction held on December 3, topping the deal with Bain and Hellman. 
The firm spun itself off in May 2009, in a transaction recognized by Fund Industry Intelligence as Deal of the Year. Lehman Brothers&#x27; creditors initially retained a 49% common equity interest in the firm and an $875 million preferred equity stake, with a coupon that climbed to 12% over three years. The preferred equity position was fully repaid in 2012. The new entity, including Neuberger, Lincoln Capital, and Crossroads, was named Neuberger Berman Group LLC. Under employee control, Larry Zicklin rejoined the firm as a member of the Board of Directors. Lehman Brothers creditors have received over $1.5 billion from the employees of Neuberger Berman, dwarfing the proceeds paid by Barclays and Nomura for businesses representing 90% of Lehman Brothers employees.

===Independence and expansion===
Since its reemergence as an independent firm, Neuberger Berman has enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The firm increased its assets under management 14% per year from 2010 to 2014, reaching $250 billion, which placed the firm at the top of its peer group by asset growth. The firm currently employs approximately 2,000 people, and has expanded beyond its traditional equity focus into the growing areas of emerging markets debt, high-yield bonds, liquid alternatives and private equity, among other strategies. During this period the firm expanded its global presence, adding coverage offices in key Asia-Pacific markets and elsewhere to be closer to a growing overseas client base.

The end of 2014 marked Neuberger Berman&#x27;s return to full employee ownership, highlighting the firm&#x27;s independence and clearing the path for future growth. Employee ownership has been recognized by industry leaders as a key factor in the success of asset management firms, and Neuberger Berman&#x27;s position as an employee-owned firm is cited as a reason for its high talent retention rate. In recognition of its culture, Neuberger Berman won the top rank in its category on &quot;Pensions &amp; Investments&quot;&#x27; 2016 Best Places to Work in Money Management survey, and had been named to the Best Places list in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

In September 2017, Neuberger Berman bought Toronto&#x27;s Breton Hill Capital for US$2 billion in assets under management.

In October 2024, a private equity consortium led by Neuberger Berman, which included EQT AB and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, agreed to buy international private school operator Nord Anglia Education for $14.5 billion.

== Philanthropy ==
Collectively, Neuberger Berman&#x27;s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation. The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual month-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices. For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm&#x27;s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide. Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces. Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y, Homes for Heroes, Per Scholas, C-CAP, New York City Service, and Habitat for Humanity.

==Corporate art collection==
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman&#x27;s corporate culture since 1939, when collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm. In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection. The firm&#x27;s corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased, many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010. Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, displaying their work in the firm&#x27;s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.

<text>Benjamin Franklin &quot;Bluff&quot; Wade (October 27, 1800March 2, 1878) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a United States Senator for Ohio from 1851 to 1869. He is known for his leading role among the Radical Republicans. Had the 1868 impeachment of U.S. President Andrew Johnson led to a conviction in the Senate, as president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, Wade would have become president for the remaining nine months of Johnson&#x27;s term.

Born in Massachusetts, Wade worked as a laborer on the Erie Canal before establishing a law practice in Jefferson, Ohio. As a member of the Whig Party, Wade served in the Ohio Senate between 1837 and 1842. After a stint as a local judge, Wade was sworn into the United States Senate in 1851. An opponent of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the Kansas–Nebraska Act, Wade joined the nascent Republican Party as the Whigs collapsed. He established a reputation as one of the most radical American politicians of the era, favoring women&#x27;s suffrage, trade union rights, and equality for African-Americans.

During the Civil War, Wade was highly critical of President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s leadership. In opposition to Lincoln&#x27;s post-war plans, which he deemed too lenient and conciliatory, Wade sponsored the Wade–Davis Bill, which proposed strict terms for the re-admittance of Confederate states. He also helped pass the Homestead Act of 1862 and the Morrill Act of 1862. In 1868, the House of Representatives impeached President Johnson for his defiance of the Tenure of Office Act; Wade&#x27;s unpopularity with his senatorial Moderate Republican colleagues was a factor in Johnson&#x27;s acquittal by the Senate, having been president pro tempore at the time and next in line for the presidency should Johnson be removed from the presidency. He lost his Senate re-election bid in 1868, though remained active in law and politics until his death in 1878. Although frequently criticized for his radicalism during his time, particularly as he opposed Lincoln&#x27;s ten-percent plan, Wade&#x27;s contemporary reputation has been lauded for his lifelong unwavering and persistent commitment to civil rights and racial equality.

==Early life and education==
Wade was born in Feeding Hills, Massachusetts, on October 27, 1800, to Mary and James Wade. Benjamin Wade&#x27;s first job was as a laborer on the Erie Canal. He also taught school before studying law in Ohio with Elisha Whittlesey. After being admitted to the bar in 1828, he began practicing law in Jefferson, Ohio.

Wade formed a partnership with Joshua Giddings, a prominent anti-slavery figure, in 1831. He became the prosecuting attorney of Ashtabula County by 1836, and as a member of the Whig Party, Wade was elected to the Ohio State Senate, serving two two-year terms between 1837 and 1842. He established a new law practice with Rufus P. Ranney and was elected presiding judge of the third district in 1847. Between 1847 and 1851, Wade was a judge of common pleas in what is now Summit County (Ohio).

In 1851 Wade was elected by his legislature to the United States Senate. There, he associated with such eventual Radical Republicans as Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner. He fought against the controversial Fugitive Slave Act and the Kansas–Nebraska Act. After the decline of the Whigs&#x27; power, Wade joined the Republican Party. He was also critical of how certain aspects of capitalism were practiced in the 19th century, opposing the imprisonment of debtors and special privileges for corporations.

==Career==
===American Civil War===

In March 1861, Wade became chairman of the Committee on Territories, and in July 1861, along with other politicians, he witnessed the defeat of the Union Army at the First Battle of Bull Run. There, he was almost captured by the Confederate Army. After arriving back at Washington, D.C., he was one of those who blamed the attack on the supposed incompetence of the leadership of the Union Army. From 1861 to 1862 he was chairman of the important Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, and in 1862, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories, was instrumental in abolishing slavery in the Federal Territories.

During the American Civil War, Wade was highly critical of President Abraham Lincoln; in a September 1861 letter, he privately wrote that Lincoln&#x27;s views on slavery &quot;could only come of one born of poor white trash and educated in a slave State.&quot; He was especially angry when Lincoln was slow to recruit African-Americans into the armies, and actively advocated for the bill that abolished slavery and had a direct hand in the passing of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862.

Wade was also critical of Lincoln&#x27;s Reconstruction Plan; in December 1863, he and Henry Winter Davis sponsored a bill that would run the South, when conquered, their way. The Wade–Davis Bill mandated that there be a fifty-percent White male Iron-Clad Loyalty Oath, Black male suffrage, and Military Governors that were to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The House of Representatives passed the bill on May 4, 1864, by a margin of 73 ayes to 59 nays; the Senate passed it on July 2, 1864, by a margin of 18 ayes to 14 nays and was brought to Lincoln&#x27;s desk. Wade signed, along with Davis, the Wade–Davis Manifesto, which accused the president of seeking reelection by the executive establishment of new state governments.

On July 28, 1866, the 39th Congress passed an act to adjust the peacetime establishment of the United States military. Wade proposed that two of the cavalry regiments should be composed of African-American enlisted personnel. After strong opposition, the legislation was passed which provided for the first black contingent in the regular U.S. Army, consisting of six regiments: 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 38th, 39th, 40th, and 41st Infantry Regiments. These units, made up of black enlisted personnel and white officers, were not the first of such units to serve on the Western Frontier. During late 1865 through early 1866, companies from the 57th US Colored Infantry Regiment and the 125th United States Colored Infantry Regiment had been assigned to posts in New Mexico Territory to provide protection for settlers in the area, and escort those going further west.

Blunt, outspoken, and above all uncompromising, Wade was among the best known of the Radicals in American politics. He played a major role in founding the new Republican Party, emancipating the slaves, and battling the enemies of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. Wade thought Lincoln was laggard in battling slavery, but Lincoln proved the better politician, building a deeper coalition in support of policies that would hold the Union together by destroying the economic base of plantation slavery that supported the Confederacy. Later when the groundwork for Radical Republicanism was being laid, Wade contended that under a new economic and social structure in the South shaped by free labor, both blacks and whites would &quot;finally occupy a platform according to their merits.&quot; He also fiercely opposed the admittance to representation of Southern states that continued denying suffrage to blacks.

As the descendant of leading Puritans, and an activist in the militant Western Reserve in Ohio, Wade&#x27;s constituents enthusiastically supported his radicalism. His defeat for reelection in the Senate in 1868 demonstrated that his statewide base was shaky. In addition to his anti-slavery activities, he also fought for land grants, women&#x27;s rights, and labor reform.

===Impeachment of Johnson, later years===

Wade initially expressed optimism in President Andrew Johnson, telling the Tennessee Democrat, &quot;we have faith in you.&quot; However, along with most other Radical Republicans, he would become highly critical of Johnson. Wade supported the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and Civil Rights Bills (which he succeeded in extending to the District of Columbia) and was a strong partisan of the Fourteenth Amendment. He also strengthened his party in Congress by forcefully advocating the admission of Nebraska and Kansas. These actions made him so prominent that at the beginning of the 40th Congress (in 1867), Wade became the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, which meant that he was next in line for the presidency (as Johnson had no vice president).

After many fallouts with the Republican-dominated Congress, the Judiciary Committee voted to impeach President Johnson (who had been a Democrat). When Johnson was impeached, Wade was sworn in as one of the senators sitting in judgment, but was greatly criticized because of his unseemly interest in the outcome of the trial. Although most senators believed that Johnson was guilty of the charges, they did not want the extremely radical Wade to become acting president. One newspaper wrote, &quot;Andrew Johnson is innocent because Ben Wade is guilty of being his successor.&quot;

According to John Roy Lynch (R-MS, 1873–77, 1882–83), one of the twenty-two African Americans elected to Congress from the South during Reconstruction, in his book &quot;Facts Concerning Reconstruction&quot;:

It was believed by many at the time that some of the [moderate] Republican Senators that voted for acquittal [of Andrew Johnson] did so chiefly on account of their antipathy to the man who would succeed to the presidency in the event of the conviction of the [sitting] president. This man was Senator Benjamin Wade, of Ohio, President pro tempore of the Senate who as the law then stood, would have succeeded to the presidency in the event of a vacancy in the office from any cause. Senator Wade was an able man … He was a strong party man. He had no patience with those who claimed to be [Radical] Republicans and yet refused to abide by the decision of the majority of the party organization [as did Grimes, Johnson, Lincoln, Pratt, and Trumbull] … the sort of active and aggressive man that would be likely to make for himself enemies of men in his own organization who were afraid of his great power and influence, and jealous of him as a political rival. That some of his senatorial Republican associates should feel that the best service they could render their country would be to do all in their power to prevent such a man from being elevated to the Presidency … for while they knew he was an able man, they also knew that, according to his convictions of party duty and party obligations, he firmly believed he who served his party best served his country best…that he would have given the country an able administration is concurrent opinion of those who knew him best.

Indeed, some of the Moderate Republican senators who voted to acquit Johnson, including William P. Fessenden of Maine, acted out of antipathy towards the staunchly pro-civil rights Wade, who they did not want to become president. Northern business interests also disdained Wade due to his advocacy of labor unions, high protective tariffs, and a &quot;soft&quot; monetary policy.

Wade lost in the 1868 election as the Democrats gained control over the state legislature. Prior to Wade&#x27;s defeat presidential candidate Ulysses S. Grant was urged by his fellow Republicans to choose Wade as his vice presidential running mate; but he refused, instead choosing another radical, Speaker Schuyler Colfax (presiding officer of the House), who coincidentally married Wade&#x27;s niece, Ellen Maria Wade, shortly after the election. Wade returned to his Ohio law practice. Though no longer a government official, Wade continued to contribute to the world of law and politics. He became an agent of the Northern Pacific Railroad, continued his party activities, became a member of the commission researching the likelihood of the purchase of the Dominican Republic in 1871 and served as an elector for Rutherford Hayes in the election of 1876.

===Stalwart politics, antipathy towards President Hayes===

Among Wade&#x27;s political activities in his post-Congress years included his taking part among the Republican &quot;Stalwart&quot; faction, the wing of the GOP which supported the Reconstruction policies of President Ulysses S. Grant and opposed civil service reform during the 1870s. He became a lobbyist for Jay Cooke and the Northern Pacific Railroad in the 1870s.

Although Wade enthusiastically supported Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27; 1876 campaign for president, he became disillusioned with Hayes&#x27; withdrawal of remaining federal troops from the South, an action he viewed as constituting a betrayal of Republican principles. He wrote in a subsequently published letter to Uriah Hunt Painter of &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
Throughout the summer and fall of 1877, Wade continued his forceful denunciation of the Hayes administration, asserting in November that the president would never have received his vote had he knew Hayes intended to &quot;abandon the Southern Republicans and put in his Cabinet a rebel who had fought four years to destroy the Government.&quot; Wade disdained Hayes&#x27; selection of David M. Key, a former Confederate officer, to the position of United States Postmaster General. However, Wade&#x27;s lack of power at this point made him helpless.

===Death===
Wade, amidst his expressed frustration and grief over President Hayes&#x27; betrayal of the Republican Party&#x27;s commitment to civil rights, fell ill. His progressively worsening health, attributed by doctors to a form of typhoid fever, would subsequently result in his death. On March 1, 1878, Wade, while lying on his bed, summoned his wife Caroline and whispered his last words:
In the following morning, Wade died in Jefferson, Ohio. News reporting quickly spread; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which had long criticized him frequently, published an obituary titled: &quot;The Last of the Congressional Champions of Freedom.&quot;

<doc id="354114" wikidata="Q209212" url="?curid=354114" title="Girolamo Frescobaldi">
<text>Girolamo Alessandro Frescobaldi (; also Gerolamo, Girolimo, and Geronimo Alissandro; September 15831 March 1643) was an Italian composer and virtuoso keyboard player. Born in the Duchy of Ferrara, he was one of the most important composers of keyboard music in the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods. A child prodigy, Frescobaldi studied under Luzzasco Luzzaschi in Ferrara, but was influenced by many composers, including Ascanio Mayone, Giovanni Maria Trabaci, and Claudio Merulo. Girolamo Frescobaldi was appointed organist of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, a focal point of power for the Cappella Giulia (a musical organisation), from 21 July 1608 until 1628 and again from 1634 until his death.

Frescobaldi&#x27;s printed collections contain some of the most influential music of the 17th century. His work influenced Johann Jakob Froberger, Johann Sebastian Bach, Henry Purcell, and other major composers. Pieces from his celebrated collection of liturgical organ music, &quot;Fiori musicali&quot; (1635), were used as models of strict counterpoint as late as the 19th century.

==Life==
Frescobaldi was born in Ferrara. His father Filippo was a man of property, possibly an organist since both Girolamo and his half-brother Cesare became organists. (There is no evidence that the Frescobaldi of Ferrara were related to the homonymous Florentine noble house.) Frescobaldi studied under Luzzasco Luzzaschi, a noted composer of madrigals and an organist at the court of Duke Alfonso II d&#x27;Este. Although Luzzaschi&#x27;s keyboard music is relatively unknown today (much of it has been lost), contemporary accounts suggest he was both a gifted composer and performer, one of the few who could perform and compose for Nicola Vicentino&#x27;s &quot;archicembalo.&quot; Contemporary accounts describe Frescobaldi as a child prodigy who was &quot;brought through various principal cities of Italy&quot;; he quickly gained prominence as a performer and patronage of important noblemen. Composers who visited Ferrara during the period included numerous important masters such as Claudio Monteverdi, John Dowland, Orlande de Lassus, Claudio Merulo, and Carlo Gesualdo.

In his early twenties, Frescobaldi left his native Ferrara for Rome. Reports place Frescobaldi in that city as early as 1604, but his presence can only be confirmed by 1607. He was the church organist at Santa Maria in Trastevere, recorded as “Girolamo Organista”, from January to May of that year. He was also employed by Guido Bentivoglio, the Archbishop of Rhodes, and accompanied him on a trip to Flanders where Bentivoglio had been made &quot;nuncio&quot; to the court. It was Frescobaldi&#x27;s only trip outside Italy. Although the court at Brussels was musically among the most important in Europe at the time, there is no evidence of Peeter Cornet&#x27;s or Peter Philips&#x27; influence on Frescobaldi. Based on Frescobaldi&#x27;s preface to his first publication, the 1608 volume of madrigals, the composer also visited Antwerp, where local musicians, impressed with his music, persuaded him to publish at least some of it. While abroad, Frescobaldi was elected on 21 July 1608 to succeed Ercole Pasquini as organist of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. Frescobaldi remained in Flanders, however, through the summer and did not return to Rome until 29 October (delaying his arrival with an extended stay in Milan to publish another collection of music, the keyboard &quot;Fantasie&quot;). He took up his duties on 31 October and held the position, albeit intermittently, until his death. He also joined Enzo Bentivoglio&#x27;s musical establishment after the latter settled in Rome in 1608, although he grew estranged from his patron after an affair with a young woman. A scandal involving competition between Bentivoglio and the Medici family eventually forced him to leave his position.

Between 1610 and 1613, Frescobaldi began to work for Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini. He remained in his service until after the death of Cardinal Aldobrandini in February 1621. On 18 February 1613, he married Orsola Travaglini, known as Orsola del Pino. The couple had five children: Francesco (an illegitimate child born on 29 May 1612), Maddalena (an illegitimate child born on 22 July 1613), Domenico (8 November 1614, poet and art collector), Stefano (1616/7), and Caterina (September 1619).

In October 1614, Frescobaldi was approached by an agent of the Duke of Mantua, Ferdinando I Gonzaga. Frescobaldi was given such a good offer he agreed to enter his employ. However, at his arrival in Mantua the reception was so cold that Frescobaldi returned to Rome by April 1615. He continued publishing his music: two editions of the first book of toccatas and a book of ricercars and canzonas appeared in 1615. In addition to his duties at the Basilica and the Aldobrandini establishment, Frescobaldi took pupils and occasionally worked at other churches. The period from 1615 to 1628 was Frescobaldi&#x27;s most productive time. His major works from this period were instrumental pieces including: a second version of the first book of toccatas (1615–6), ricercars and canzonas (1615), the cappricios (1624), the second book of toccatas (1627), and a volume of canzonas for one to four instruments and continuo (1628).

St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica gave Frescobaldi permission to leave Rome on 22 November 1628. Girolamo moved to Florence, Italy into the service of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, a Medici. During his sojourn there he was the highest paid musician and served as the organist of the Florence baptistery for a year. He stayed in the city until 1634; the period resulted in, among other things, the publication of two books of arias (1630). The composer returned to Rome in April 1634, having been summoned into the service of the powerful Barberini family, i.e. Pope Urban VIII, the highest prize offered to any musician. He continued working at St. Peter&#x27;s, and was also employed by Cardinal Francesco Barberini, who also employed the famous lutenist Johannes Hieronymus Kapsberger. Frescobaldi published one of his most influential collections, &quot;Fiori musicali&quot;, in 1635, and also produced reprints of older collections in 1637. No other prints followed (although a collection of previously unpublished works appeared in 1645, and in 1664 Domenico Frescobaldi still possessed pieces by his father that were never published). Frescobaldi died on 1 March 1643 after an illness that lasted for 10 days. He was buried in Santi Apostoli, but the tomb disappeared during a rebuilding of the church in the late 18th century. A grave bearing his name and honoring him as one of the fathers of Italian music exists in the church today.

==Music==

Frescobaldi was, after Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, the first of the great composers of the ancient Franco-Netherlandish-Italian tradition who chose to focus his creative energy on instrumental composition. Frescobaldi brought a wide range of emotion to the relatively unplumbed depths of instrumental music. Keyboard music occupies the most important position in Frescobaldi&#x27;s extant oeuvre. He published eight collections of it during his lifetime, several were reprinted under his supervision, and more pieces were either published posthumously or transmitted in manuscripts. His collection of instrumental ensemble canzonas, &quot;Il Primo Libro delle Canzoni&quot;, was published in two editions in Rome in 1628, and substantially revised in the Venice edition of 1634. Of the forty pieces in the collection, ten were replaced and all were revised to various degrees, sixteen of them radically so. This extensive editing attests to Frescobaldi&#x27;s ongoing interest in the utmost perfection of his pieces and collections.

Frescobaldi&#x27;s compositional canon began with his 1615 publications. One of the publications issued in 1615 was &quot;Ricercari, et canzone&quot;. This work returned to the old-fashioned, pure style of ricercar. Fast note values and triple meter were not allowed to detract from the purity of style. A second publication of 1615 was the &quot;Toccate e partite&quot; which established expressive keyboard style. Frescobaldi did not obey the conventional rules for composing, ensuring no two works have a similar structure. From 1615 to 1628, Frescobaldi&#x27;s publications connect him with the Congregazione exactly when the group&#x27;s activities determined the Roman musical trends.

Frescobaldi&#x27;s next stream of compositions expanded their artistic range beyond the keyboard music that he had focused on previously. Frescobaldi&#x27;s next four publications after 1627 were composed for instrumental and vocal ensembles in both sacred and secular genres. The collections of thirty sacred works of 1627 and forty ensemble canzonas of 1628 are structural opposites. However, both are written in a more traditional style that makes them appropriate for church use. The &quot;Arie musicali&quot;, published in 1630, were probably composed earlier while Frescobaldi was in Rome. These two volumes utilize keyboard pairs, the romanesca/ruggiero and the ciaconna/passacaglia, within the vocal mode.

In 1635, Frescobaldi published &quot;Fiori musicali&quot;. This group of works is his only composition devoted to church music and his last collection containing completely new pieces. The &quot;Fiori&quot; experiments with many types of genres within the liturgical confines of a mass. Almost all of the genres practiced by Frescobaldi are present within this collection except for the popular style. Frescobaldi cultivated the old form of organ improvisation on a Gregorian chant &quot;cantus firmus&quot; that is best displayed within the &quot;Fiori muscali&quot;. The organ alternated with the choir on &quot;versets&quot; and improvised in a contrapuntal style. Works from &quot;Fiori musicali&quot; were still used as models of strict counterpoint in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Aside from &quot;Fiori musicali&quot;, Frescobaldi&#x27;s two books of &quot;toccatas&quot; and &quot;partitas&quot; (1615 and 1627) are his most important collections. His &quot;toccatas&quot; could be used in masses and liturgical occasions. These &quot;toccatas&quot; served as preludes to larger pieces, or were pieces of substantial length standing alone. The &quot;Secondo libro&quot;, written in 1627, stretches the conception of the genres included in the first book of &quot;toccatas.&quot; More variety is introduced with different rhythmic techniques and four organ pieces. Both books open with a set of twelve &quot;toccatas&quot; written in a flamboyant improvisatory style and alternating fast-note runs or &quot;passaggi&quot; with more intimate and meditative parts, called &quot;affetti&quot;, plus short bursts of contrapuntal imitation.

Virtuosic techniques permeate the music and make some of the pieces challenging even for modern performers—&quot;Toccata IX&quot; from &quot;Secondo libro di toccata&quot; bears an inscription by the composer: &quot;Non senza fatiga si giunge al fine&quot;, &quot;Not without toil will you get to the end.&quot; Such short remarks appear also in works from &quot;Fiori musicali&quot;; one of these refers to a fifth voice that is to be sung by the performer at key moments during a &quot;ricercar,&quot; and the key moments are left to the performer to find. Frescobaldi&#x27;s famous note for this piece is &quot;&quot;Intendami chi puo che m&#x27;intend&#x27; io&quot;—&quot;Understand me, [who can,] as long as I can understand myself&quot;. The concept is yet another illustration of Frescobaldi&#x27;s innovative, bold approach to composition.

Although Frescobaldi was influenced by numerous earlier composers such as the Neapolitans Ascanio Mayone and Giovanni Maria Trabaci and the Venetian Claudio Merulo, his music represents much more than a summary of its influences. Aside from his masterful treatment of traditional forms, Frescobaldi is important for his numerous innovations, particularly in the field of tempo: unlike his predecessors, he would include in his pieces sections in contrasting tempi, and some of his publications include a lengthy preface detailing tempo-related aspects of performance. In effect, he made a compromise between the ancient white mensural notation with a rigid &quot;tactus&quot; and the modern notion of tempo. Although this idea was not new (it was used by, for example, Giulio Caccini), Frescobaldi was among the first to popularize it in keyboard music.

Frescobaldi also made substantial contributions to the art of variation; he may have been one of the first composers to introduce the juxtaposition of the &quot;ciaccona&quot; and &quot;passacaglia&quot; into the music repertory, as well as the first to compose a set of variations on an original theme (all earlier examples are variations on folk or popular melodies). Frescobaldi showed an increasing interest in composing intricate works out of unrelated individual pieces during his last years of composing. The last work Frescobaldi composed, &quot;Cento partite sopra passacagli&quot;, was his most impressive creative work. The &quot;Cento&quot; displays Frescobaldi&#x27;s new interest in combining different pieces that were first written independently.

The composer&#x27;s other works include collections of &quot;canzonas,&quot; fantasias, &quot;capriccios,&quot; and other keyboard genres, as well as four prints of vocal music (motets and arias; one book of motets is lost) and one of ensemble &quot;canzonas.&quot;

==Legacy==

Contemporary critics acknowledged Frescobaldi as one of the greatest trendsetters of keyboard music of their time. Even critics who did not approve of Frescobaldi&#x27;s vocal works agreed that he was a genius both playing and composing for the keyboard. Frescobaldi&#x27;s music did not lose direct influence until the 1660s, and his works held influence over the development of keyboard music over a century after his death. Bernardo Pasquini promoted Girolamo Frescobaldi to the rank of pedagogical authority.

Frescobaldi&#x27;s pupils included numerous Italian composers, but the most important was a German, Johann Jakob Froberger, who studied with him in 1637–41. Froberger&#x27;s works were influenced not only by Frescobaldi but also by Michelangelo Rossi; he became one of the most influential composers of the 17th century, and, similarly to Frescobaldi, his works were still studied in the 18th century. Frescobaldi&#x27;s work was known to, and influenced, numerous major composers outside Italy, including Henry Purcell, Johann Pachelbel, and Johann Sebastian Bach.

Bach is known to have owned a number of Frescobaldi&#x27;s works, including a manuscript copy of Frescobaldi&#x27;s &quot;Fiori musicali&quot; (Venice, 1635), which he signed and dated 1714 and performed in Weimar the same year. Frescobaldi&#x27;s influence on Bach is most evident in his early choral preludes for organ. Finally, Frescobaldi&#x27;s &quot;toccatas&quot; and &quot;canzonas,&quot; with their sudden changes and contrasting sections, may have inspired the celebrated &quot;stylus fantasticus&quot; of the North German organ school.

The WYSIWYG editor for LilyPond music files is called Frescobaldi to honour the composer.

<doc id="354115" wikidata="Q1342628" url="?curid=354115" title="Unconventional warfare">
<text>Unconventional warfare (UW) is broadly defined as &quot;military and quasi-military operations other than conventional warfare&quot; and may use covert forces or actions such as subversion, diversion, sabotage, espionage, biowarfare, sanctions, propaganda or guerrilla warfare. This is typically done to avoid escalation into conventional warfare as well as international conventions.

==Description==
Aside from the earlier definition of warfare that is not conventional, unconventional warfare has also been described as:

There is another type of warfare— new in its intensity, ancient in its origin—war by guerrillas, subversives, insurgents, assassins; war by ambush instead of by combat, by infiltration instead of aggression, seeking victory by eroding and exhausting the enemy instead of engaging him. It preys on unrest.

==Methods and organization==

Unconventional warfare targets the civilian population psychologically to win hearts and minds, and only targets military and political bodies for that purpose, seeking to render the military proficiency of the enemy irrelevant. Limited conventional warfare tactics can be used unconventionally to demonstrate might and power, rather than to reduce the enemy&#x27;s ability to fight substantially. In addition to the surgical application of traditional weapons, other armaments that specifically target the military can be used are: airstrikes, nuclear weapons, incendiary devices, or other such weapons. 

Special Forces, inserted deep behind enemy lines, are used unconventionally to train, equip, and advise locals who oppose their government. They can also spread subversion and propaganda, while they aid native resistance fighters, to ultimately cause a hostile government to capitulate. Tactics focus on destroying military targets while avoiding damage to civilian infrastructure and blockading military resupply are used to decrease the morale of government forces.
The U.S. Department of Defense defines unconventional warfare as activities conducted to enable a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force in a denied area. 
==History==
Between the 17th and 18th centuries, there were wars between American colonists and Native American tribes. Benjamin Church designed his force primarily to emulate Native American patterns of war. Toward this end, Church endeavored to learn to fight like Native Americans from Native Americans. Americans became rangers exclusively under the tutelage of the Native American allies. (Until the end of the colonial period, rangers depended on Native Americans as both allies and teachers.)

Church developed a special full-time unit mixing white colonists selected for frontier skills with friendly Native Americans to carry out offensive strikes against hostile Native Americans in terrain where normal militia units were ineffective. Church paid special care to outfitting, supplying and instructing his troops in ways inspired by indigenous methods of warfare and ways of living. He emphasized the adoption of indigenous techniques, which prioritized small, mobile and flexible units which used the countryside for cover, in lieu of massed frontal assaults by large formations. Church also pioneered the use of indigenous warriors as auxiliaries to bolster and educate his soldiers. In 1716, his memoirs, entitled &quot;Entertaining Passages relating to Philip&#x27;s War&quot;, was published and is considered by some to constitute the first American military manual and first written guide to unconventional warfare. Benjamin Church is sometimes referred to as the father of unconventional warfare. The ideas of Benjamin Church were widely incorporated into warfare by early colonial officers, especially by American colonialists who prevailed in the Revolutionary War against the British Empire.

===Atomic Age===
The advent of the Atomic Age changed forever philosophies of conventional warfare, and the necessity to conceal authorship of actions by hostile states. The age of asymmetric, or unconventional warfare &amp; terrorism had begun.

One of the first references is in &quot;Manpower and Atomic War,&quot; which Edward Fitzpatrick referred to as &quot;the next kind of war- technological war, machine war, or atomic war.&quot; 

Using soft power methods, to target civilians instead of military units, however had begun earlier, particularly as a strategy for use against Republics. These were developed as a tool of national socialism, or neo-liberalism, and evolved into other doctrines.

There is an overlap in the world of Corporate Security &amp; Defense Contracting where these models have extended to the field of Risk assessment. One of the first instances of Unconventional Warfare techniques against civilians was documented by the La Follette Committee.

<text>Philotheos Bryennios (; 7 April 1833 – November 18, 1917) was a Greek Orthodox metropolitan of Nicomedia, and the discoverer in 1873 of an important manuscript with copies of early Church documents.

==Life==
Born in the Tavtalos (Kurtuluş) district of Constantinople, with the secular name of Theodore, he was educated at the theological school in Halki, and at the universities of Leipzig, Munich, and Berlin. He became a professor at Halki in 1861, and then director in 1863. In 1867 he went to head the Patriarchal School in Constantinople, leaving in 1875 to attend the Old Catholic conference in Bonn, during which he was appointed metropolitan of Serres in Macedonia. In 1877 he became Metropolitan of Nicomedia.

In 1877, he participated in a commission dealing with plundered monasteries in Moldavia and Wallachia.

Metropolitan Bryennios died in 1917 in his native Constantinople.

==Works==
In 1873, he discovered a manuscript in the library of the monastery of the Holy Sepulcher (Jerusalem Patriarchate metochion) in Constantinople (present day Istanbul, Turkey), which contained a Synopsis of the books of the Old and New Testaments attributed to St. John Chrysostom, the Epistle of Barnabas, the First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians, the Second Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians, the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (&quot;Didache&quot;), the twelve Ignatian Epistles, and a short treatise on the genealogy of Christ. The epistles were published in 1875, and the &quot;Didache&quot; in 1883; the epistles of Clement and the Didache had notes written by Bryennios. The discovery of the &quot;Didache&quot; was significant because writers of the early 3rd, 4th and later centuries had spoken of it, but it was presumed lost.

<doc id="354122" wikidata="Q1077160" url="?curid=354122" title="Gallipoli (1981 film)">
<text>Gallipoli is a 1981 Australian war drama film directed by Peter Weir and produced by Patricia Lovell and Robert Stigwood, starring Mel Gibson and Mark Lee. The film revolves around several young men from Western Australia who enlist in the Australian Army during World War I. They are sent to the Gallipoli peninsula in the Ottoman Empire (modern Turkey), where they take part in the Gallipoli campaign. During the course of the film, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the purpose of war. The climax of the film occurs on the Anzac battlefield at Gallipoli, depicting the futile attack at the Battle of the Nek on 7 August 1915. It modifies events for dramatic purpose and contains a number of significant historical inaccuracies.

&quot;Gallipoli&quot;, which had a budget of $2.6 million, provides a faithful portrayal of life in Australia in the 1910s—reminiscent of Weir&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; set in 1900—and captures the ideals and character of the Australians who joined up to fight, as well as the conditions they endured on the battlefield, although its portrayal of British forces has been criticised as inaccurate. It followed the Australian New Wave war film &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; (1980) and preceded the 5-part TV series &quot;Anzacs&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Lighthorsemen&quot; (1987). Themes of these films include the Australian identity, such as mateship and larrikinism, the loss of innocence in war, and the continued coming of age of the Australian nation and its soldiers (later called the Anzac spirit).

&quot;Gallipoli&quot; received heavy international promotion and distribution and helped to elevate the worldwide reputation of the Australian film industry and of later Australian New Wave films. The film also helped to launch the international career of actor Mel Gibson. Due to the Gallipoli battlefields becoming tourist destinations in the 21st century, the film is often shown at the hostels and hotels in Eceabat and Çanakkale on the Dardanelles. In the &quot;20 to 1&quot; episode &quot;Great Aussie Films&quot;, &quot;Gallipoli&quot; was listed as Number 1.

==Plot==
In Western Australia, May 1915, Archy Hamilton, an 18-year-old stockman and prize-winning sprinter, longs to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). He is trained by his uncle Jack and idolises Harry Lasalles, the world champion over 100 yards. Archy wins a race with a bullying farmhand, Les McCann, Archy running bare-foot and Les riding his horse bareback.

Frank Dunne is an unemployed ex-railway labourer who has run out of money. He is an accomplished sprinter and hopes to win the prize money at the athletics carnival; he also bets a lot of money on himself winning. Archy and Uncle Jack journey to the athletics carnival. Frank is surprised when Archy defeats him, and is bitter at first and feels robbed of his bet. Eventually, Frank approaches Archy in a cafe after getting over his loss. Archy gives all the prize money he won at the race to Jack and tells him that he will not be coming home for he has decided to enlist. They both decide to travel to Perth and enlist there.

As Archy and Frank are penniless, they secretly hop on a freight train. As they awake the next morning, they discover the train had stopped at a remote desert station instead of Perth. The station attendant informs them that they could either wait a fortnight for the next train, or walk 50 miles across the dry lake bed to reach a location with a more frequent service. Archy immediately sets off while Frank chases behind trying to persuade him to stay, reminding him that they could die in the desert much as members of the Burke &amp; Wills expedition did. With Archy&#x27;s navigation skills, the pair eventually reach a cattle station in safety. Upon arriving in Perth, they arrange to stay with Frank&#x27;s father, an Irish migrant. Due to Frank&#x27;s Irish heritage and general cynicism, he has little desire to fight for the British Empire. Archy persuades him to try to enlist in the Australian Light Horse. Failing to ride a horse, Frank enlists in the infantry with three co-workers from the railway, Bill, Barney and Snowy. Many of the motivations for enlistment are revealed: wartime anti-German propaganda, a sense of adventure and the attraction of the uniform. All soldiers embark on a transport ship bound for Cairo. Frank and Archy are separated and embark on different troopships.

Some months later, Frank and his fellow soldiers train near the Pyramids and spend their free time in Cairo, drinking and visiting brothels. During a training exercise, Frank and Archy meet once again; Frank is able to transfer to the Light Horse, as they are now being sent to the Gallipoli peninsula as infantry. They arrive at Anzac Cove and endure several days of hardships and boredom in the trenches. Frank&#x27;s infantry friends fight in the Battle of Lone Pine on 6 August. Afterwards, a traumatised Billy tells Frank what happened to the others, Barney has been killed and Snowy is in a hospital but in such bad condition that he is denied food and water. The following morning, Archy and Frank are ordered to take part in the charge at the Nek, a diversion in support of the British Landing at Suvla Bay. Archy is ordered by Major Barton to be the message runner. He declines the offer and recommends Frank for the role.

The Light Horse are to attack in three waves across a stretch of ground defended by Ottoman machine gunners. The first wave is to go at 4:30 a.m., after an artillery bombardment. Unfortunately, the commanders&#x27; watches are not synchronised and the bombardment ends too early. The brigade&#x27;s commander, Colonel Robinson, insists the Anzac attack proceed; the first wave is cut down by the Ottomans within seconds. The second wave goes over, to a similar fate. Major Barton wants to halt the attack to end the carnage, but the Colonel says that somebody told him Anzac marker flags were seen in the Turkish trenches, indicating that the attack was partially successful. The phone line goes dead, and Barton gives Frank a message to carry to Brigade HQ, but when he arrives, the Colonel insists the attack continue.

Lieutenant Gray, Major Barton&#x27;s second-in-command, admits to Barton that he was the soldier who said that he saw marker flags, though he did not remember who told &quot;him&quot;. Frank suggests to the Major that he go over the Colonel&#x27;s head to General Gardner. Frank hurries to Gardner&#x27;s headquarters down on the beach. The General is informed that, at Suvla, the British landing party is brewing tea on the beach. He tells Frank that he is reconsidering the attack. Frank sprints back to convey this news, but the phone lines are repaired and Colonel Robinson orders the attack to continue. Barton joins his men in the attack, climbs out of the trench pistol in hand, and signals his men to charge. Archy joins the last wave and goes over the top. Frank arrives seconds too late and lets out a scream of anguish and despair. As Archy&#x27;s companions are cut down by gunfire, he drops his rifle and runs as hard as he can. The final frame freezes on Archy being hit by bullets across his chest, head flung back, as if breaking the tape at the finish of a 100-yard sprint, and falling backwards.

==Themes==
A theme of this film is loss of innocence and the coming of age of the Australian soldiers and of their country. An early scene in the film shows Uncle Jack reading from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; about how Mowgli has reached manhood and now must leave the family of wolves that raised him. The actor Mel Gibson commented, &quot;Gallipoli was the birth of a nation. It was the shattering of a dream for Australia. They had banded together to fight the Hun and died by the thousands in a dirty little trench war.&quot; In an examination of &quot;Gallipoli&quot;&#x27;s legacy, SBS Movies notes &quot;The soldiers of &quot;Gallipoli&quot; head to war because it is expected of them, just as Australia headed to war because, as part of the British Empire, it was expected of the nation.

==Production==
Peter Weir had wanted to make a film about the Gallipoli campaign since visiting Gallipoli in 1976 and discovering an empty Eno bottle on the beach. He wrote an outline of the script and gave it to David Williamson to turn into a screenplay. The script went through many variations; the South Australian Film Corporation did not like an early draft and said they did not want to fund the film, which then had a proposed budget of A$4.5 million. In May 1979 Weir asked Patricia Lovell to produce the film. The script then began to focus on the story of two runners. Lovell managed to raise A$850,000, which was not enough to make the film.

===Pre-production===
On 1 May 1980 Rupert Murdoch and Robert Stigwood announced they were forming a film company, R&amp;R Films, later known as Associated R&amp;R Films. This was a joint venture between News Corporation and the Robert Stigwood Organisation. They pledged an investment total of A$10m in local productions, with &quot;Gallipoli&quot; being the first but the company did not produce any more films. Lovell approached them with the script, and they agreed to fund it provided the budget did not exceed $3 million. He later said the final budget was $2.8 million, or $2.4 million with the rest consisting of fees. This was the highest budget of an Australian film to date. Murdoch&#x27;s father, Keith Murdoch, had been a journalist during World War I, and after visiting Gallipoli in September 1915 became an influential agitator against the conduct of the campaign by the British high command.

Francis O&#x27;Brien, the only American in the company, was appointed international president of the company, and became executive producer of the film. Ben Gannon returned from the U.S. in 1980 join the company as general manager, and was associate producer of the film. He spent two years with the company, which he later described as &quot;very frustrating&quot;. R&amp;R had intended to develop more Australian films, with Australian directors and writers, with the next project slated as a film based on Gabrielle Lord&#x27;s novel &quot;Fortress&quot;.

The company was first registered with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission on 13 August 1980 as R&amp;R Films Pty Ltd, and is still registered with its address listed as News Corp Australia&#x27;s Surry Hills headquarters.

===Casting===
Peter Weir cast Mel Gibson in the role of the cynical Frank Dunne, and newcomer Mark Lee was recruited to play the idealistic Archy Hamilton, after participating in a photo session for the director. Gibson described the film as &quot;Not really a war movie. That&#x27;s just the backdrop. It&#x27;s really the story of two young men&quot;. Gibson explained the director&#x27;s reasons for casting the two leads

I&#x27;d auditioned for an earlier film and he told me right up front, &#x27;I&#x27;m not going to cast you for this part. You&#x27;re not old enough. But thanks for coming in, I just wanted to meet you&#x27;. He told me he wanted me for &quot;Gallipoli&quot; a couple of years later because I wasn&#x27;t the archetypal Australian. He had Mark Lee, the angelic-looking, ideal Australian kid, and he wanted something of a modern sensibility. He thought the audience needed someone to relate to of their own time.

===Filming===
&quot;Gallipoli&quot; was filmed primarily in South Australia. The cattle station scenes were shot in Beltana, the salt lake at Lake Torrens, and Adelaide railway station. The pyramid and bazaar scenes were filmed on location in Egypt. The farewell ball scene was not in the original script but was an idea of Weir&#x27;s during shooting. It cost an extra $60,000 to make.

A large set recreating the Turkish Gallipoli peninsula was built on a stretch of coastline west of Port Lincoln. It has been known as Gallipoli beach ever since. With its legacy, an Anzac war memorial honouring those who fell in the Gallipoli campaign has been erected near the beach.

==Soundtrack==
The original music was provided by Australian composer Brian May (who had also scored &quot;Mad Max&quot;). The film includes excerpts from &quot;Oxygène&quot; by French electronic music pioneer Jean Michel Jarre during running scenes. Quiet or sombre moments at Gallipoli, and the closing credits, feature the &quot;Adagio in G minor&quot;, by Tomaso Albinoni.

The film also features the &quot;Pearl Fishers&#x27; Duet&quot; by Georges Bizet playing on Major Barton&#x27;s gramophone before the final attack, drawing a parallel between the bond shared by the ill-fated soldiers of the film and the fishermen in Bizet&#x27;s opera.

A soundtrack album was not released.

==Release==
The film was screened at the Variety Club of Australia in 1980 and at the 1981 Australian Film Institute. It was released in Australia on 13 August 1981 by Roadshow Film Distributors, in the United States on 28 August, by Paramount Pictures, and Cinema International Corporation handled the rest of international distribution. It was released in UK cinemas on 10 December 1981.

On 1 May 1981, the Australian Classification Review Board announced that the film would receive a PG certificate rating.

&quot;Gallipoli&quot; proved to be a success domestically, grossing AUD $11.7 million at the box office in Australia. Although critically praised by many, the international releases were not quite as successful financially. &quot;Gallipoli&quot; only earned US$5.7 million on the US market.

&quot;Film Comment&quot; wrote that &quot;Paramount apparently lavished substantial print-ad spending in an effort to create a broad market for a specialized film that faltered beyond first-run -as did virtually every other 1981 film on which this strategy was used.&quot;

==Reception==
The film has an approval rating of 91% based on 46 reviews at review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Peter Weir&#x27;s devastating anti-war film features a low-key but emotionally wrenching performance from Mel Gibson as a young soldier fighting in one of World War I&#x27;s most deadly and horrifying battles&quot;. Metacritic gives the film a score of 65 out of a possible 100 based on reviews by six critics, indicating generally favourable reviews. Almost 40 years on, the film is still well regarded by Australian critics with Guardian film critic, Luke Buckamster, describing it as &quot;one of the best loved and most quintessially &#x27;Australian&#x27; films&quot;. Irrespective of the generally positive critical reception, the historical accuracy of the film still provokes historical cultural debates by commentators.

==Box office==
Gallipoli proved to be a domestic success, grossing A$11.7 million at the Australian box office. Although the film was widely acclaimed by critics internationally, its box-office success outside Australia was modest. It earned US$5.7 million in the United States, where it was distributed in arthouse cinemas. In France, the film only attracted 39,227 spectators.

==Awards &amp; nominations==
The film was nominated for or won the following awards:
==Home media==
The film was first released in Australia on VHS in 1984.

In 2001 &quot;Gallipoli&quot; was released for the first time on DVD widescreen with two extra features, an interview with director Peter Weir and cinema trailer.

In 2005 a North American and 2006 (UK) Special Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD was released with a different extra feature and includes a 63-minute documentary titled &quot;Entrenched: The Making of Gallipoli&quot; with interviews from the cast and crew and production.

A 2015 2-disc Commemorative Edition was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on DVD and for the first time, on Digital HD and Blu-ray exclusively in Australia.

==Historical accuracy==
&quot;Gallipoli&quot; shows much of the conditions and events that soldiers endured in the Gallipoli theatre of war. Archy Hamilton&#x27;s athlete character was inspired by a line from Australian war historian Charles Bean&#x27;s &quot;Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918&quot;, describing Private Wilfred Harper of the 10th Light Horse during the forlorn Battle of the Nek, &quot;Wilfred... was last seen running forward like a schoolboy in a foot-race, with all the speed he could compass&quot;. An officer, who wrote a letter to Harper&#x27;s mother, stated &quot;Wilfred I believe was one of the few who got at most twenty yards&quot;.

The most notable deviation of the film from the truth and the one for which it has been most criticised, is its portrayal of the chain of command at the Nek. Although he is seen wearing an AIF uniform, Colonel Robinson is often mistaken for an Englishman due to his accent. Colonel Robinson speaks with a clipped accent typical for an upper class Australian of the period. Colonel Robinson&#x27;s character was based on the brigade major of the 3rd Brigade, Colonel John Antill, an Australian Boer War veteran. Very little British command and control was exercised at the Nek.

In his popular history novel &quot;Gallipoli&quot;, published in 2001, Les Carlyon agreed that the film unfairly portrays the English during the battle, with Carlyon laying the blame for the debacle squarely at the feet of Antill and 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade commander, Brigadier-General Frederic Hughes, &quot;The scale of the tragedy of the Nek was mostly the work of two Australian incompetents, Hughes and Antill&quot;. The film implies that the fictional and benevolent General Gardiner called off the attack, when in reality the attack petered out when half of the 4th wave charged without orders while the surviving regimental commander in the trenches, Lieutenant-Colonel Noel Brazier, attempted to get the attack called off.

Other critics, Carlyon included, have pointed out that the Australian attack at the Nek was a diversion for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force&#x27;s attack at the Battle of Sari Bair, not the British landing at Suvla. The British were therefore not &quot;drinking tea on the beach&quot; while Australians died for them. Two companies of a British regiment, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, suffered many losses trying to support the Australian attack at the Nek once it was realised that the attack was in trouble.

Some have also criticised the film for its portrayal of British officers and their disdain for Australian discipline behind the lines. According to Robert Rhodes James, no evidence for any such disdain on the part of British commanders for their Australian troops exists. The British command&#x27;s low regard for the discipline of Australian troops behind the lines has been widely documented by earlier historians, such as Charles Bean, and more recent ones such as Carlyon, as well as by the oral tradition of survivors.

<text>DBLP is a computer science bibliography website. Starting in 1993 at Universität Trier in Germany, it grew from a small collection of HTML files and became an organization hosting a database and logic programming bibliography site. Since November 2018, DBLP is a branch of Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik (LZI). DBLP listed more than 5.4 million journal articles, conference papers, and other publications on computer science in December 2020, up from about 14,000 in 1995 and 3.66 million in July 2016. All important journals on computer science are tracked. Proceedings papers of many conferences are also tracked. It is mirrored at three sites across the Internet.

For his work on maintaining DBLP, Michael Ley received an award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the VLDB Endowment Special Recognition Award in 1997. Furthermore, he was awarded the ACM Distinguished Service Award for &quot;creating, developing, and curating DBLP&quot; in 2019.

&quot;DBLP&quot; originally stood for &quot;DataBase systems and Logic Programming&quot;. As a backronym, it has been taken to stand for &quot;Digital Bibliography &amp; Library Project&quot;; however, it is now preferred that the acronym be simply a name, hence the new title &quot;The DBLP Computer Science Bibliography&quot;.

==DBL-Browser==

&quot;DBL-Browser&quot; (&quot;Digital Bibliographic Library Browser&quot;) is a utility for browsing the DBLP website. The browser was written by Alexander Weber in 2005 at the University of Trier. It was designed for use off-line in reading the DBLP, which consisted of 696,000 bibliographic entries in 2005 (and in 2015 has more than 2.9 million).

DBL-Browser is GPL software, available for download from SourceForge. It uses the XML DTD. Written in Java programming language, this code shows the bibliographic entry in several types of screens, ranging from graphics to text:
*Author page
*Article page
*Table of contents
*Related conferences / journals
*Related authors (graphic representation of relationships)
*Trend analysis (graphics histogram)

DBLP is similar to the bibliographic portion of arxiv.org which also links to articles. DBL-Browser provides a means to view some of the associated computer science articles.

<doc id="354131" wikidata="Q1243337" url="?curid=354131" title="Bilevel rail car">
<text>A bilevel car (American English) or double-decker coach (British English and Canadian English) is a type of rail car that has two levels of passenger accommodation as opposed to one, increasing passenger capacity (up to 57% per car in extreme cases).

The use of double-decker carriages, where feasible, can resolve capacity problems on a railroad, avoiding other options which have an associated infrastructure cost such as longer trains (which require longer station platforms), more trains per hour (which the signalling or safety requirements may not allow) or adding extra tracks besides the existing line.

Double deck trains are claimed to be more energy efficient, and may have a lower operating cost per passenger. A bi-level car may carry up to about twice as many as a normal car, if structure and loading gauges permit, without requiring double the weight to pull or material to build. However, a bi-level train may take longer to exchange passengers at each station, since more people will enter and exit from each car. The increased dwell time makes them most popular on long-distance routes which make fewer stops (and may be popular with passengers for offering a better view).

Double deck cars may not be usable in countries or on older railroad systems with low loading gauge, most notably the majority of the British railway network. In some countries such as the UK new lines are built to a higher than the existing structure gauge to allow the use of double-deck trains in future.

==History==

Double deck carriages date to at least as early as the second half of the 19th century. In France several hundred &quot;voitures à impériale&quot; with seats on the roof were in use by the Chemins de fer de l&#x27;Ouest, Chemins de fer de l&#x27;Est and Chemins de fer du Nord by 1870, having been in use for over 2 decades; the upper deck was open at the sides with a light roof or awning covering the seats. In the 1860s, M.J.B. Vidard introduced two-storied carriages on the Chemins de fer de l&#x27;Est, with a full body, windows, and doors; the same design lowered the floor of the lower storey to keep the center of gravity low. Vidard&#x27;s carriages had a total height of with the head height in the lower part of the carriage only ; the carriages had a capacity of 80 persons (third class) in a 2 axle vehicle of 13 tons fully loaded. The first all-steel &quot;Chemins de fer de l&#x27;État bilevels&quot; are an early example of split-level cars.

The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad placed bilevel Gallery cars in commuter service in the Chicago area in 1950. These were successful, and led to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway introducing long-distance Hi-Level cars on Chicago–Los Angeles &quot;El Capitan&quot; streamliner in 1954.

In 1968, the four experimental double-deck power cars entered service in Sydney, Australia, enabling the first fully double-deck Electric Multiple Unit passenger train in the world.

== Typical design ==
The double-deck design usually includes lowering the bottom floor to below the top level of the wheels, closer to the rails, and then adding an upper floor above. Such a design will fit under more bridges, tunnels and power wires (structure gauge). For cost and safety, this design also minimizes car height (loading gauge) and lowers the centre of gravity.

Depending on train station platform heights, three designs can be used for entry – high platforms require use of a &quot;split level&quot; car design, where the doors are located on a middle level, with access into the upper or lower level branching off – with stairs or ramps going both up and down (sometimes this configuration includes a section of seating at the middle level in the entry section, with double levels only in part of the lengths of the car). For low train station platforms, a &quot;two-floor&quot; design with level entry onto the lower floor is used. Occasionally a third, very tall &quot;two floors over-wheel&quot; design is used. This is a traditional single floor car &quot;with a second story&quot; design which, when using a low platform, requires steps up to a traditional floor height and then internal stairs up to the upper floor.

== Platform height and floor height issues ==

There are four important height measurements above the railhead: platform height, traditional floor height, downstairs floor height and upstairs floor height. Platform height determines the level entry height for wheeled objects, such as luggage, strollers, wheelchairs and bicycles. Platform height is ideally standardized across all stations the train serves. Traditional rail car floor height matters for end doors connecting to existing single floor rail cars. Downstairs or lowest floor height is primarily determined by the thickness of the beams connecting the span between the wheels and bogies (trucks) of a rail car. The upstairs floor or highest floor height is above the lowest floor and must fit under bridges and tunnels. Level entry floor height must match the platform height. Hopefully either the traditional or downstairs floor height already matches the platform height. Despite the name &quot;bilevel&quot; or &quot;double-decker&quot;, for maximum compatibility the rail car will have up to four different floor heights. High platform design (Using outside steps to avoid having a level entry from the platform) is troublesome.

===Common low-platform design===
Most low-platform double-decker trains have level entry onto the lower level of the car, allowing wheelchair access. There are two-floor heights (upstairs and downstairs) in these &quot;bilevel&quot; cars. There is a staircase between floors inside the car. Connecting doors between cars are either at the (higher) upper floor or at an intermediate level over the bogies. In the former case, connecting directly to a single level car causes drag and connecting door problems.

In the western USA, cars are of the upper-level-connection type. They use low-platform stations, because the traditional single floor trains all had exterior entry steps to maximize flexibility (emergency and temporary stops) and minimize infrastructure costs. There are no examples of two-floor platforms, so there are no platform doors on the upper floor. Car roof lines lengthwise are flat for connecting doors to the upstairs of bi-level cars. A Pullman-Standard / Bombardier Amtrak Superliner car is tall.

===Uncommon very tall design===
There are several very tall bilevel cars (e.g. the Colorado Railcar DMU is tall). They typically are described as a traditional rail car with a second story. Most of these cars serve low platforms so they have exterior steps up to the traditional &quot;over-wheel&quot; floor height e.g. US . End doors connect at the traditional height of existing rolling stock. Some cars have upstairs end doors as well. Many of these cars also include outside balconies on either the upper or lower level. Upstairs and downstairs connect by interior stairs. These cars can fit most able people, but lack level entry. On almost all these cars the upper level consists of a full-length glass dome. Some cars are self-propelled multiple units so using traditional floor heights appears fixed. In towed cars, it is possible to lower the downstairs floor between the wheels/bogies so that level entry is possible with more than of added headroom and interior steps from that floor to the traditional floor.

==Operators==

===Argentina===

In 2005, Emprendimientos Ferroviarios (Emfer), Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA (Trains of Buenos Aires)), National Institute of Industrial Technology and the Argentine National Government subscribed to a framework agreement to start the national designing and construction of bi-level electric trains. This was decided due to the overwhelming and increasing number of passengers using the gauge urban Sarmiento Line, serving the centre and east of Greater Buenos Aires. The first prototype was released in 2005, but mass-production only started in mid 2008. In 2013, these coaches were retired from the line and replaced with new CSR Electric Multiple Units, though it remains unclear if the Emfer trains will be moved elsewhere in the country.

In 2010, Emprendimientos Ferroviarios and Trenes de Buenos Aires presented non-engined double-decker coaches for a diesel interurban link between Buenos Aires and Mercedes city. Attending to different technical needs, the new coaches have only two simple non-automatic doors in the ends (instead of the two electric double doors in the middle) and were designed for low platforms.

For 2020, a public tender was launched by Trenes Argentinos to recover these double-decker coaches, for inter-urban and long-distance services, equipping them with reclining seats, USB inputs and other amenities.

===Australia===

In 1964, Tulloch Limited built the first double-decker trailer cars for use in Sydney. They ran with single deck electric motor cars. After the success of the trailers, Tulloch built four experiment double decker power cars in 1968.

From 1972, more double decker multiple units were constructed by Comeng and Goninan. These are now known as the S sets. All electric suburban and interurban trains in Greater Sydney are now double deck, though the Sydney Metro uses single deck carriages. All double deck carriages have two doors per side per carriage, with a vestibule at each end at platform height. The Sydney double deck commuter trains are high.

The Public Transport Corporation in Melbourne ordered a prototype Double Deck Development and Demonstration train in 1991, a modification of the Tangara design used in Sydney. It suffered frequent breakdowns and spent long periods out of use. It was withdrawn in 2002 and scrapped in 2006.

===Austria===
Historically, bilevel cars were implemented in 1873 and were in use until World War I. In 1993, the railway company &quot;Graz-Köflacher Bahn&quot; started to use 15 cars for suburban transport around the city of Graz. In 1997, the national railway company ÖBB ordered 120 bilevel cars for the use in Eastern Austria and Vienna metropolitan area.

===Canada===

Canada&#x27;s national passenger railway company, Via Rail, does not currently operate any bilevel coaches in its fleet, apart from the dome cars used on some long-distance services. These coaches include two levels over part of the length of the vehicle.

The Ontario Northland Railway operates a bilevel dome car on its Polar Bear Express service with two levels along the entire length of the vehicle.

The Bombardier BiLevel Coach was originally designed by Hawker-Siddeley Canada for the GO Transit commuter rail network in southern Ontario. It is now used by 14 different railway operators across North America, including all three of Canada&#x27;s commuter rail systems. All train services operated by GO Transit and West Coast Express use Bombardier BiLevel coaches, while Montreal&#x27;s Exo trains use a mix of Bombardier Bilevel, Bombardier MultiLevel and various single-level coaches.

The private rail tour company Rocky Mountaineer uses bilevel full-length dome cars built by Colorado Railcar.
===China===

The first bilevel train for China Railways was built by Sifang in 1958 as Dongfeng diesel multiple unit, consisting of two locomotives and four bilevel coaches. After withdrawing Dongfeng DMU from use in 1982, China Railways redeveloped double-decker trains, the first of which rolled out from Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Works in 1987 as SYZ25 and SRZ25.

The carriage designations of bilevel cars in China start with &quot;S&quot;, abbreviating &quot;double-decker&quot; () in Chinese. Current models of double decker trains include the , and . Most bilevel cars in China were built by Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Works, while some bilevel coaches were built by Changchun Railway Vehicles. The types of bilevel cars including bilevel hard seat (SYZ), bilevel soft seat (SRZ), bilevel hard sleeper (SYW), bilevel soft sleeper (SRW), Bilevel dining car (SCA) and bilevel soft seat-baggage combine car (SRZXL).

Bilevel coaches are mainly used for regional services in China, like Kunming–Dali–Lijiang intercity trains in Yunnan and Shijiazhuang–Qinhuangdao express train in Hebei. Additionally, a cross-railway bureau double-deck train service is provided between Tianjin and Baoji (via Beijing West railway station).

===Czech Republic===
České dráhy operates 83 electric multiple units of Class 471 manufactured by Škoda Vagonka, which was a subsidiary of Škoda Transportation and locomotive-hauled trains which was also used on the non-electrified routes around Prague.

===Denmark===

In Denmark, DSB began running Bombardier Double-deck Coaches in 2002. The coaches are used on Regional services on Zealand.

===Finland===
In Finland, VR began operating double-deck day cars in 1998. They are Finnish-designed and manufactured by Transtech in Kajaani. Each car has two entrances on the lower level of the middle section, allowing level entry from station platforms at the modern Finnish standard height of . The end sections of each car – and the inter-car connections – are at mid-level.

VR introduced its first double-deck sleeping cars on 1 February 2006. The two-bed cabins on the upper deck have toilets and showers while cabins on the lower deck use shared ones. Double-deck driving-trailers were introduced during late 2013 and restaurant cars in early 2014.

The double-deck cars are designed for running at higher speeds than ordinary passenger cars – up to , although the upper limit was later reduced for trains entering tunnels. The cars are frequently operated in all-double-deck InterCity trains (known as IC2) with at-seat power supply for laptops and wireless LAN internet connection.
===France===

The Chemins de fer de l&#x27;État in France ran &quot;voitures à 2 étages&quot; split level double-deck suburban coaches from 1933. Its successor, the SNCF, has been running VB2N double-decker coaches since 1975; VB2N were introduced from 1975 as a replacement of the État cars.

SNCF began running double-deck RER trains in 1982, followed by RATP in 1995. And since 1996, SNCF runs double-deck TGV cars on heavily used high-speed services, such as on the Paris-Lyon-Marseille line. Many suburban rail, regional rail and high-speed services are operated by double-deck DMUs, EMUs, coaches and TGV. The TGV Duplex are the fastest double-decker trains in the world with a commercial top speed of 320 km/h. Specially tuned trainset 4402 also holds the world speed record for conventional trains, reaching 574.8 km/h in 2007. The French loading gauge dictates that the double-deck cars have a maximum height of .

===Germany===
The East German railway company &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR)&quot; implemented the first bilevel cars in 1974 for interurban lines. After the revolutions in Eastern Europe, the German reunification the new founded national railway company &quot;Deutsche Bahn&quot; took over the DR bilevel cars and started to order high numbers of bilevel cars for regional and interurban traffic.

===Hong Kong===
MTRCL and formerly KCRC operate double-decker carriages with the KTT train sets on its cross-boundary route between Kowloon and Guangzhou. These cars were manufactured in Japan by Kinki Sharyo. The &quot;Ktt&quot; cars were used to serve between the Hung Hom and Lo Wu stations from January to May 1998, before the electrification of Guangzhou–Shenzhen railway. The &quot;Ktt&quot; cars have lower bottom floor than the ordinary single-deck cars serving on the same pair of tracks.

===India===

In India, the Sinhagad Express was the first train to operate with double-decker carriages, followed by other trains on the Mumbai-Pune route like the Deccan Queen and the Deccan Express, although double-decker service on these routes was later discontinued. In 1979, the Flying Ranee, a passenger train between Surat and Mumbai Central on the Western Railway became the first superfast train to use double-deck cars. The first air-conditioned double-decker service was introduced in 2011 on the Howrah–Dhanbad Double Decker Express between Howrah station in West Bengal and Dhanbad Junction in Jharkhand which was subsequently followed by Delhi Sarai RohillaJaipur, Ahmedabad–Mumbai Central, Chennai CentralBangalore, Anand Vihar (New Delhi)Lucknow, Visakhapatnam–Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam–Tirupati and Mumbai Lokmanya Tilak TerminusMadgaon double decker expresses.

===Israel===

Israel Railways began running Bombardier Double-deck Coaches in 2001. The coaches were manufactured in Görlitz, Germany, and form the vast majority of its passenger fleet as of 2021.

Later, a Desiro HC by Siemens has been introduced to Israel Railways. Desiro HC has 2-floor coaches in the middle of the train, while the first and the last coaches are single-floor. The train operates mainly on the Herzlia–Jerusalem electrified line (via Tel Aviv) as of 2022.

===Italy===
In the 1970s, with the rise of mass commuting to the big cities the Ferrovie dello Stato have found themselves having to quickly increase the capacity of their services with Carrozze Due Piani Tipo 1979 based on French VB2N (see :it:Carrozza Due Piani). Today, double-decker coaches are also in use by private railway companies Ferrovie Nord Milano and Ferrovie del Sud Est. The types of double-decker train is circulating today in Italy are: &quot;Rock&quot; (&quot;Caravaggio&quot;)&quot;, Vivalto&quot;, &quot;TAF&quot;, &quot;TSR&quot;.
===Japan===

In Japan, double-decker trains are used either to show better scenery, or to increase seat capacity. In Tokyo area commuter trains, double-decker cars are generally used as &quot;Green Cars&quot;, the cars with better accommodations than the regular commuter cars.

The first Japanese double-decker train appeared in 1904. It was Type 5 train of Osaka City Tram. The Kintetsu Railway 20100 Series EMUs were built in 1962 and designed for school excursion. Sightseeing trains that feature double-decker carriages include the JR Shikoku 5000 series, Keihan 8000 series, JR Central 371 series, and Odakyu 20000 series RSE. The first JNR/JR double-decker trains were 200 series Shinkansen and 100 series Shinkansen, for Shinkansen lines.

JR East introduced the 215 series double-deck EMUs for &quot;Home Liner&quot; services in 1992. JR East also introduced E1 Series Shinkansen and E4 Series Shinkansen for its Shinkansen Lines; the trains are doubled decked to increase their capacities. This includes JR West 285 series EMUs for &quot;Sunrise Izumo&quot;/&quot;Sunrise Seto&quot; and JR East E26 series cars for &quot;Cassiopeia&quot; services.
===Russia===

In 2012, a prototype double-decker rail carriage was made at the TVZ Tver Carriage Building Factory for the RZD Russian Railways company. This prototype carriage is a sleeping car with four-berth compartments and a total capacity of 64 passengers. 
Russian Railways ordered double-decker sleeper carriages from Transmashholding for the Adler-Moscow train service. they were expected to be delivered in time for the 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi. RZD offers low platforms for Moscow-Adler route.


On 27 October 2017, Aeroexpress began operating ESH2 motor-car (locomotive-less) high-speed double-decker trains developed by the Swiss company Stadler on the routes MoscowDomodedovo Airport and MoscowVnukovo Airport. From November 2019, the trains were transferred to the OdintsovoSheremetyevo Airport route (OdintsovoBelorussky railway Station in the MDC mode).

===Slovakia===
ZSSK operates 19 electric multiple units of Class 671 and 10 push-pull units of Class 951 manufactured by Škoda Transportation.

These trains mostly operate services between Žilina and Košice (Žilina – Trenčín, Žilina – Košice, Košice – Prešov and some others) and around Bratislava (between Kúty and Trnava).

As of 2016 some of units 951, usually with locomotive of class 350 (Škoda 55E), are used at international train service on Bratislava (SK) – Břeclav (CZ) main line.

===Sweden===

SJ AB operates 43 double-decker EMUs built by Alstom and designated class X40. The EMU comes in a two-coach version and a three-coach version. The trains are mainly used in regional trains in the areas around lake Mälaren and in the trains between Gävle and Linköping. It has a maximum speed of and is equipped with wireless internet. 

From 2019 onwards, the bilevel Stadler KISS (known as DOSTO in Sweden) has also been used in the Mälardalen and Uppsala regions of Sweden, and since 2023, has operated the same train sets in the Bergslagen region.

Between 1966 and 1990, SJ used DMUs of class Y3 with double-decker end cars and normal cars in between. Due to the distinct humps on the endcars, it was nicknamed &quot;the camel&quot;.
===Switzerland===

Double-decker commuter trains are used by the Zürich S-Bahn. Three types of trains are used, an older type consisting of an electric locomotive with double-decker cars, and Electric Multiple Units where the motors are on board the car. From 2010 onwards, a third type – the Stadler KISS – has entered service.

The Swiss Federal Railways also operate the IC 2000 double-decker passenger coaches in most of Switzerland for high speed InterCity and InterRegio services. After massive delays, they are introducing the Bombardier TWINDEXX from 2019 on.

Both these high speed trains feature passages on the upper level only, which makes them incompatible with single level coaches, IC2000 are however still used in combination with single level coaches during rush hours.

===Ukraine===

In 2012, as part of preparation for UEFA Euro 2012, Ukrainian Railways bought two EJ675 EMUs manufactured by Škoda Transportation. These trains are used on inter-regional services. They were discontinued for modernization and redesigning in 2019. The two units were brought back to service in 2022 and currently run on the Kyiv–Lutsk line.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, due to the small loading gauge, the railway system cannot easily accommodate double-deck trains. A modest attempt at double decking was made in 1948 on the Southern Railway with the two trains of the Bulleid 4DD class. Although innovative, with stepped compartments where the bottoms of the upper seats are above the heads of the people on the lower level but the feet of the people above are not, the loading gauge severely restricted their use and they were removed from service in 1971. Research by DCA concluded that double-decker trains were practical within the UK loading gauge and proposed a design for Crossrail in 2006, however the design was not taken forwards.

Double-decker trams, taller than the railway loading gauge, were common in British cities. When trams were replaced between the 1930s–1960s, their replacement would be double-decker buses.

=== United States ===


Bilevel passenger rail cars used in the United States are manufactured by Bombardier (now Alstom), Kawasaki, Colorado Railcar (today US Railcar), and several others, with the former two having produced the majority of the high platform &quot;split level&quot; commuter rail cars in use in the northeastern states.

Colorado Railcar produced bilevel DMUs and Ultra Dome passenger cars. Colorado Railcar cars measure in height and have steps that enter to a lower deck that is above the rail.

Other designs, including rolling stock made by Colorado Railcar, Budd, Pullman-Standard, Bombardier and others have an entrance on the lower deck rather than an intermediate level. Amtrak Superliners are double-decker cars of this variety, with the entrance a step or so up from the lowest station platform level, or at the level of slightly higher platforms, and allow passage from car to car on the upper level.

Some operators in the United States use a specific design of bi-level car known as a &quot;gallery car&quot; (see below).

====Long-distance trains====
Most of Amtrak&#x27;s intercity passenger trains operating to points west of Chicago use Superliners, as do select trains east of Chicago, like the Capitol Limited and Auto Train. In addition, Alaska Railroad operates passenger trains with a mix of traditional passenger equipment and large fleets of Colorado Railcar Ultra Domes (sometimes as many as 15 in one train) owned by several major cruise ship lines.

====Northeastern United States====
Most passenger rail lines in the Northeast have a loading gauge that can only accommodate cars or less in height. This is due to structure gauge restrictions such as bridges and tunnels that are too low, and may also have electrified lines overhead.

Nevertheless, commuter railroads such as the Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit, MARC, and MBTA all use bilevel railcars built to unique designs to clear specific structure gauge problems on those systems. The bilevels used on LIRR, MARC, and MBTA were built by Kawasaki Rail Car, Inc., while the bilevel cars used by NJ Transit were built by Bombardier. Recently Hyundai Rotem has built additional new cars of a similar design for MBTA.

In each of these agencies&#x27; bilevel cars, two levels are present between the trucks of the car. At each end, stairs lead from both levels to a common floor which is located at standard height over the trucks. All LIRR bilevel passenger rail cars have two wide quarter-point doors on each side, for high level platforms only. The bilevel cars used by NJ Transit and Exo have four doors on each side, two quarter-point doors at high level platform height and one at each end vestibule, with traps used to reach low level platforms. The bilevel cars used by MBTA have side doors with traps at each end vestibule. MARC operates both of the latter two types of cars.

The Superliners used for many Amtrak intercity services do not fit in these systems. Single-deck Viewliners and Amfleet IIs are used instead.

====California====
Due to the typically-generous clearances on California railroads due to freight railroads expanding clearances to accommodate double-stacked containers, bilevel cars are common in the state. The California Department of Transportation owns 88 California Cars, which are based on the Superliner body shell, but with high-density interiors suitable for corridor trains. These cars, along with 39 owned directly by Amtrak, are dedicated to state-subsidized Amtrak California routes including the San Joaquin, Capitol Corridor and Pacific Surfliner routes. The Surfliner also serves Amtrak&#x27;s California lines.

Metrolink, which serves Southern California, has 137 active Bombardier BiLevel Coaches (Sentinel Fleet) and 137 Hyundai Rotem bi-level cars (Guardian Fleet).

Caltrain in the Bay Area uses both Bombardier BiLevels and Nippon Sharyo gallery cars. From 2024, bilevel Stadler KISS electric multiple units will run on the newly electrified network.

====Florida====

Southeast Florida&#x27;s Tri-Rail commuter service between Miami and West Palm Beach uses the Bombardier BiLevel Coach and Rotem Commuter Cars. SunRail, which serves the Greater Orlando area, also uses Bombardier BiLevel coaches.

====Illinois====
Metra has a large fleet of gallery cars, and Highliner II gallery electric multiple units (EMUs). The NICTD South Shore Line fleet also includes very similar gallery EMUs. Chicago does not have the loading gauge problems that affect passenger rail lines in most northeastern states because it has very few railroad tunnels for the lines of these passenger trains except for a brief distance in the city.

In January 2021, the Metra board approved the purchase of 200 of a new design of multilevel car from Alstom, with options for up to 300 more.

Former Metra coaches were operated by a number of other agencies in the first two decades of the twenty-first century; as of 2021, they are still used for Nashville&#x27;s WeGo Star (formerly branded as the Music City Star). 

====Massachusetts====

The MBTA is the public agency responsible for operating most public transport services in Greater Boston. Its MBTA Commuter Rail system currently uses 277 bilevel passenger cars made by Kawasaki and Hyundai Rotem.

====New Mexico====
The New Mexico Rail Runner Express utilizes Bombardier BiLevel cars on its route from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Belen, New Mexico.

==== Virginia ====
Virginia Railway Express operated 13 Kawasaki bi-level cars between 1999 and 2008, after which they were sold to MARC (these cars were originally procured as an option on MARC&#x27;s larger order). From 2001, VRE also operated a number of ex-Metra Pullman-Standard gallery cars. These were all gradually replaced by new Sumitomo/Nippon Sharyo gallery cars between 2006 and 2018.

====Utah====
FrontRunner commuter rail, operated by the Utah Transit Authority to connect multiple cities along the Wasatch Front, utilizes Bombardier BiLevel Coaches.

===Other countries===
====Asia====
In Iran, the Tehran-Hashtgerd suburban commuter line is served with electric push-pull hauled trainsets with double-decker carriages manufactured by Wagon Pars in Iran.

In the Philippines, bilevel trams ran on the &quot;Tranvias&quot; of Manila. These were push–pull trains carried by lightweight steam locomotives. There were also double-deck sleeping cars used on the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; until 2014.

In South Korea, ITX-Cheongchun, the express train of Korail uses double-decker cars along with single-decker ones.

In Vietnam, the train operated by Vietnam Railways between Saigon and Phan Thiet occasionally carries double deck carriages to fulfil extra demand.

====Europe====
In Germany, Bombardier&#x27;s double-deck rail cars are also used extensively on suburban trains by the DB. The same rail cars serve some of the routes on the Israel Railways network, hauled by diesel locomotives and include electric generators housed in the control car. Belgian latest models (M6 and M7 cars) also belong to the Bombardier double deck family while the older M5 are based on the French VB2N.
In the Netherlands, there are two types of double-deck trains in use, the VIRM and the DDZ. The VIRM, is an example from the Netherlands, of High platform (split level) double-decker multiple units. It is one step up from the station platform to the entrance, and from there seven steps upstairs or four steps downstairs. There are two retired types of double-deck trains, the DDM-1 and the DD-AR who were retired from regular service on 15 December 2019. DDZ trainsets are made of refurbished DD-AR coaches with a six-axle MDDM power car.

In Portugal, CP Urban Services and Fertagus use double-deck trains around Lisbon in commuter rail services.

In Spain, several lines of Cercanías (Renfe&#x27;s commuter rail service) use double-deck trainsets.

In Romania, some regional trains use bilevel cars. Over 200 bi-level cars were imported from Waggonbau Görlitz starting with the early 1980s.

==Gallery cars==

=== Design ===
Because the two levels are separate on most bi-level cars, there is a physical limitation on a single conductor, as it can be difficult for them to check and sell tickets to passengers on the two levels. Gallery cars feature upper levels, which are &quot;mezzanines&quot; or &quot;balconies&quot; running along both sides of the car, with an open area between them. The split balcony enables conductors walking along on the lower level to easily reach up and punch or validate tickets of the passengers seated on the mezzanine level. Passengers can place their tickets in clips along a lengthwise panel, located slightly above the conductor&#x27;s head and within easy reach. The conductor can then check all tickets and move to the next car.

Most gallery cars have four separate galleries with four separate stairwells to the main level (one gallery on each side, split in the middle by the central vestibule). These stairwells are adjacent to the central vestibule where the exterior doors are situated. There is typically a low first step at the vestibule entrance to the car, which is above the head of the rail. However, Metra Electric Highliner (now retired) and Highliner II have high-level entrances for the high-level platforms on that line. NICTD South Shore Line Bi-Levels are similar to the Metra Highliner IIs but have entrances at the end of the rail car opposite the cab with a stairwell and trap doors for low-level platforms.

=== Manufacturers and operators ===
The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy was the first railroad to receive gallery cars, built by the Budd Company in 1950. In total, 141 cars of this design were delivered to the CB&amp;Q (and its successors) between 1950 and 1978. The Milwaukee Road ordered a revised design of gallery car from Budd in 1961, and production ran until 1980. Over 250 of this design were produced, including a small batch for the Rock Island Line. Most of these Budd gallery cars are still in service with Metra. The design was also licensed to Canadian Vickers, who built 9 cars for Canadian Pacific in 1970 for commuter service in Montreal.

In 1955, the Chicago and North Western ordered 16 gallery cars from the St. Louis Car Company. Unlike the stainless steel Budd cars, these cars have smooth, painted steel bodyshells. Further orders were built by Pullman-Standard between 1956 and 1970, with minor revisions to the design, including a cab car variant from 1960 onwards. Over 250 were built for the C&amp;NW, Rock Island Line and their successors, a small number of which remain in service. After initial retirement from Metra in the late 1990s, many of these cars were acquired by other commuter rail agencies across the United States, including (among others) UTA FrontRunner, MARC, WeGo Star and Virginia Railway Express. Southern Pacific also acquired 46 Pullman-Standard gallery cars for the Peninsula Commute service in San Francisco in three orders: 1955, 1957 (built by American Car and Foundry to Pullman-Standard designs) and 1968.

To replace the Southern Pacific gallery cars, Caltrain acquired new gallery cars from Nippon Sharyo in 1985. A second batch followed in 1999-2000. Further orders for this design were placed by Metra and Virginia Railway Express between 2002 and 2008. Follow-on contracts included options for additional cars, the last of which were delivered in 2020. Morrison-Knudsen/Amerail had also built similar gallery cars for Metra between 1992 and 1998, using bodyshells provided by Nippon Sharyo.

=== Highliner electric multiple unit ===
The Highliner and Highliner II, along with similar vehicles in the NICTD South Shore Line fleet, are electric multiple units formed of gallery cars. The Highliner I was built by the St. Louis Car Company in 1971 for the Illinois Central, with additional cars built by Bombardier in 1978-1979. These were replaced by Highliner II EMUs built by Nippon Sharyo in 2005.

It became known to the world in 1963 because of a mining disaster and the subsequent rescue operation of eleven surviving miners, which became known as the &quot;[[Wunder von Lengede]]&quot; (&quot;Miracle of Lengede&quot;).

==Geography==

===Division of the municipality===
Lengede consists of the following districts
* Barbecke
* Broistedt
* Klein Lafferde
* Lengede
* Woltwiesche

==History==

===The Miracle of Lengede===

A lot of water was needed to wash the ore of the iron mine &quot;Mathilde&quot; in Lengede, and several artificial lakes existed right above the underground mine. At 8 p.m. on 24 October 1963, water and mud from one of those lakes broke into the mine. At that time, 129 men were working underground. Seventy-nine men managed to escape right away. A group of seven men was reached with a drill; when the water level receded on the next day, they could be saved with a float.

Four men went to the elevated end of a gallery; even though it was below water level, the air pocket there prevented the water from entering. Expecting to find men there, a drilling was begun to the cavern some 79 meters below ground. In the meantime, journalists from all over the world had assembled. As it was of utmost importance to protect the air pocket, pressured air was pumped down. After six days, three men were finally rescued; a fourth had died in the meantime. The men were brought up with the &quot;Dahlbusch-Bombe&quot;, a tiny metal pipe which allows one man to stand inside. They had to spend several hours in a pressure chamber before being released.

A group of twenty-one men had fled to an old part of the mine, known as the &quot;Old Man&quot;, which was not used anymore and had already partly collapsed. Falling rocks killed several men there, ventilation was poor, and after a while their lamps went dark. The management of the mine was already about to end the rescue operation and call for funeral services, when some miners pointed out that some men would have tried to escape to the &quot;Old Man&quot; and were maybe still there. No exact plans for that part of the mine were available, and an exploratory drill was started.

Fifty-six metres underground, a cavern was reached. Tapping signs were heard, and the rescuers let food, water and even a microphone down to the men below. Ludwig Erhard, who had been elected Bundeskanzler just weeks earlier, came to Lengede and spoke to the trapped men, then the real drilling began. Because of concerns about the poor condition of &quot;Old Man&quot;, water was considered too heavy for use in the drilling below 40 metres and pressured air was used instead. At 6 a.m. on November 7, the men were reached. Two miners went down with the &quot;Dahlbusch-Bombe&quot; to help their colleagues come up. Eleven men were rescued.

All in all, twenty-nine men died in the disaster. When the mine was later cleared, it was found that some of them had lived for about 14 days underground. One man was never found.

Legal proceeding continued for some five years to determine whether anyone was responsible for the disaster, but in the end no one was prosecuted.

<text>Macrina the Elder (; before AD 270 – ) was the mother of Basil the Elder, and the grandmother of Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, Peter of Sebaste, and Macrina the Younger.

==Life==
The works of her grandson Basil indicate that she studied under Gregory Thaumaturgus, and that it was his teachings handed down through Macrina to Basil and Gregory, that were particularly formative for the two Cappadocian brothers. 

Her home was at Neocaesarea in Pontus and according to Gregory Nazianzen, during the persecution of Christians under Galerius and Diocletian, Macrina fled with her husband to the shores of the Black Sea. Once the persecution had passed, Macrina and her family returned to Neocaesarea.

She was widowed and is the patron of widows. Macrina is also the patron against poverty. Her feast is celebrated on 14 January. She is said to have died in the early 340s AD.

<doc id="354143" wikidata="Q612739" url="?curid=354143" title="Operation Eagle Claw">
<text>Operation Eagle Claw (Persian: عملیات پنجه عقاب) was a failed operation by the United States Armed Forces ordered by U.S. President Jimmy Carter to attempt the rescue of 53 embassy staff held captive at the Embassy of the United States, Tehran, on 24 April 1980. The operation, one of Delta Force&#x27;s first, encountered many obstacles and failures and was subsequently aborted. Eight helicopters were sent to the first staging area called &quot;Desert One&quot;, but only five arrived in operational condition. One had encountered hydraulic problems, another was caught in a sand storm, and the third showed signs of a cracked rotor blade. During the operational planning, it was decided that the mission would be aborted if fewer than six helicopters remained operational upon arrival at the Desert One site, despite only four being absolutely necessary. In a move that is still discussed in military circles, the field commanders advised President Carter to abort the mission, which he did.

As the U.S. forces prepared to withdraw from &quot;Desert One&quot;, one of the remaining helicopters crashed into a transport aircraft that contained both servicemen and jet fuel. The resulting fire destroyed both aircraft and killed eight servicemen. In the context of the Iranian Revolution, Iran&#x27;s new leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, stated that the mission had been stopped by an act of God (&quot;angels of God&quot;) who had foiled the U.S. mission in order to protect Iran and its new Islamist government. In turn, Carter blamed his loss in the 1980 U.S. presidential election mainly on his failure to secure the release of the hostages. The American hostages were released the day of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s inauguration.

==Motivation for military intervention==

On 4 November 1979, fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were taken hostage in the United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran, by a group of Iranian college students belonging to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam&#x27;s Line, avid supporters of the Iranian Revolution. American President Jimmy Carter called the hostage-taking an act of &quot;blackmail&quot; and the hostages &quot;victims of terrorism and anarchy&quot;. but in Iran it was widely seen as an act against the U.S. and its influence in Iran, including its perceived attempts to undermine the Iranian Revolution and its longstanding support of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in 1979.

The crisis had reached a climax after diplomatic negotiations failed to secure the release of the hostages. Facing elections and with little to show from negotiations, the Carter government ordered the State Department to sever diplomatic relations with Iran on 7 April 1980. Cyrus Vance, the United States Secretary of State, had argued against a push by National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski for a military solution to the crisis. Vance left Washington on Thursday 10 April for a long weekend vacation in Florida. The following day, Friday 11 April, Brzezinski held a newly scheduled meeting of the National Security Council where he insisted that it was time to &quot;lance the boil&quot;, and Carter said it was &quot;time for us to bring our hostages home&quot;. During this Security Council meeting of 11 April Carter confirmed that he had authorized the mission. He also continued to entertain the planning for a concurrent punitive air-strike, but this was finally rejected on 23 April, one day before the start of the mission, which was code-named &quot;Operation Eagle Claw&quot;.

&quot;Operation Eagle Claw&quot; occurred amid a breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and its western neighbor Iraq, including frequent border skirmishes, calls by Khomeini for Iraqi Shi&#x27;ites to revolt against the ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party, and allegations of Iraqi support for Arab and Kurdish separatists in Iran. According to an 11 April 1980 Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysis, &quot;Evidence indicates that Iraq had probably planned to initiate a major military move against Iran with the aim of toppling the Khomeini regime&quot; and had &quot;sought to engage the Kuwaitis to act as intermediary in obtaining United States approval and support for Iraqi military action against Iran&quot;. Carter, who wrote in his diary on 10 April that &quot;The Iranian terrorists are making all kinds of crazy threats to kill the American hostages if they are invaded by Iraq—whom they identify as an American puppet,&quot; may have been influenced by such reports to approve a rescue mission prior to the outbreak of a possible Iran–Iraq War.

==Planning and preparation==

Planning for a possible rescue mission began on 6 November, two days after the hostages were taken. Army Major General James B. Vaught was appointed as Joint Task Force commander and was to be forward-based at Wadi Kena in Egypt, reporting directly to the President. In turn, he had two field commanders: USAF Colonel James H. Kyle as the field commander for aviation and U.S. Army Colonel Charlie Beckwith as ground forces field commander. In planning the operation, some of the maps the US used were tourist maps.

The ambitious plan was to be based on the use of elements from four branches of the U.S. military: Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force. The concept was based on an operation where helicopters and C-130 aircraft, following different routes, would rendezvous on a salt flat (code-named &quot;Desert One&quot;) 200 miles (320 km) southeast of Tehran. Here the helicopters would refuel from the C-130s and pick up the combat troops who had flown in on the C-130 transports. The helicopters would then transport the troops to a mountain location (&quot;Desert Two&quot;) closer to Tehran, from which the rescue raid would be launched into the city the following night. The operation was further to be supported by an in-country CIA team. On completion of the raid, hostages were to be taken to a captured Tehran airport from where they were to be flown to Egypt.

On 31 March, anticipating the need for military action, a U.S. Air Force Combat Controller, Major John T. Carney Jr., was flown in a Twin Otter to &quot;Desert One&quot; by covert CIA operatives Jim Rhyne and Claude &quot;Bud&quot; McBroom for a clandestine survey of the proposed landing areas for the helicopters and C-130s. Carney installed remotely operated infrared lights and an IR strobe to outline a landing pattern for the pilots. He also took soil samples to determine the load-bearing properties of the desert surface. At the time of the survey, the salt-flat floor was hard-packed sand, but in the ensuing three weeks an ankle-deep layer of powdery sand had been deposited by sandstorms.

The Tehran CIA Special Activities Division in-country paramilitary team, led by retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer Richard J. Meadows, had two assignments: to obtain information about the hostages and the embassy grounds and to transport the rescue team from &quot;Desert Two&quot; to the embassy grounds in pre-staged vehicles. &quot;Desert One&quot; was in the South Khorasan Province, in the Dasht-e Lut desert near Tabas (); &quot;Desert Two&quot; was located 50 miles (80 km) short of Tehran at .

===Assault teams===
The ground forces consisted of 93 Delta soldiers to assault the embassy and a 13-man special forces assault team from Detachment &quot;A&quot; Berlin Brigade to assault the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where three further hostages were being held. A third group of 12 Rangers were to act as the roadblock team at the &quot;Desert One&quot; landing area. Rangers were also tasked with taking and holding the Manzariyeh Air Base near Tehran to be used to escape from Iran. In addition, the CIA had prepared an in-country team of 15 Iranian and American Persian-speakers, most of whom would act as truck drivers.

===Ingress===
The complex plan required that on the first night, three USAF EC-130s (Call signs: &quot;Republic 4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, and &quot;6&quot;), carrying the logistical supplies, and three MC-130E Combat Talons (Call signs: &quot;Dragon 1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;), carrying Delta Force and Ranger troops (132 assault and security troops in total), would depart Masirah, off the coast of Oman, for &quot;Desert One,&quot; a flight of over 1,000 miles (1600 km). They would be refueled by Air Force KC-135 tankers en route. &quot;Desert One&quot; would be secured by a protection force, and once secured, a refueling area would be established for the helicopters with approximately 6,000 US gallons (22,700 L) of jet fuel being made available from collapsible fuel bladders carried in the C-130s.

Eight United States Navy (USN) RH-53D Sea Stallion (Call signs: &quot;Bluebeard 1 – 8&quot;) helicopters were positioned aboard , 60 miles off the coast of Iran. The helicopters would fly to &quot;Desert One&quot;, refuel, load up the Delta Force and part of the Ranger teams, then fly 260 miles (420 km) further to &quot;Desert Two.&quot; As it would be close to morning, the helicopters and ground forces would hide during the day at &quot;Desert Two&quot;. The rescue operation would take place the second night.

===Rescue raid===

First, CIA officers who were already inside Iran would bring trucks they had sourced to &quot;Desert Two&quot;. Together, the CIA officers and ground forces would then drive from &quot;Desert Two&quot; into Tehran. This team would assault the embassy and Foreign Affairs building, eliminate the guards, and rescue the hostages, with air support from Air Force AC-130 gunships flying from &quot;Desert One.&quot; The hostages and rescue team would then rendezvous with the helicopters from &quot;Desert Two&quot; at the nearby Amjadieh Stadium, where the hostages and rescue teams would board the helicopters.

===Egress===
In parallel to the rescue, an Army Ranger company would capture the abandoned Manzariyeh Air Base, () about 60 miles southwest of Tehran, to allow two C-141 Starlifters to arrive from Saudi Arabia. The helicopters would bring all parties from the stadium to the Manzariyeh airbase, and the C-141s would fly them to an airbase in Egypt. The eight helicopters would be destroyed before departure.

===Protection and support===
Protection for the operation was to be provided by Carrier Air Wing Eight (CVW-8) operating from &quot;Nimitz&quot; and CVW-14 operating from . For this operation, the aircraft bore special invasion stripe identification on their right wings. This was necessary to distinguish support aircraft from Iranian F-14 and F-4 aircraft purchased by Iran from the US in the time of the Shah. CVW-14 Marine F-4Ns were marked with a red (VMFA-323) or yellow (VMFA-531) stripe enclosed by two black stripes while CVW-14 attack aircraft (A-7s and A-6s) had an orange stripe enclosed by two black stripes.

==The mission==

Only the delivery of the soldiers, equipment and fuel by the C-130 aircraft went according to plan. MC-130 &quot;Dragon 1&quot; landed at &quot;Desert One&quot; at 22:47 local time. The landing was made under blacked-out conditions using the improvised infrared landing light system installed by Carney on the airstrip, visible only through night vision goggles. The heavily loaded &quot;Dragon 1&quot; required four passes to determine that there were no obstructions on the airstrip and to align with the runway. &quot;Dragon 1&quot; off-loaded the road-watch teams in Jeeps and a USAF Combat Control Team (CCT) to establish a parallel landing zone north of the dirt road and to set out TACAN beacons to guide in the helicopters.

Soon after the first crews landed and began securing &quot;Desert One&quot;, a civilian Iranian bus with a driver and 43 passengers was stopped while traveling on the road, which now served as the runway for the aircraft. The bus was forced to halt by the Rangers and the passengers were detained aboard &quot;Republic 3&quot;. Minutes after the bus had been stopped, the Rangers in the road-watch team observed a fuel tanker truck, ignoring their orders to halt, bearing down on them. The truck, apparently smuggling fuel, was blown up by the Army Ranger roadblock team using a shoulder-fired rocket as it tried to escape the site. The truck&#x27;s passenger was killed, but the driver managed to escape in an accompanying pickup truck. As the tanker truck was thought to be engaged in clandestine smuggling, the driver was not considered to pose a security threat to the mission. The resulting fire illuminated the nighttime landscape for many miles around, and provided a visual guide to &quot;Desert One&quot; for the disoriented incoming helicopters.

Two hours into the flight, RH-53D &quot;Bluebeard 6&quot; made an emergency landing in the desert when a sensor indicated a cracked rotor blade. Its crew was picked up by &quot;Bluebeard 8&quot; and the aircraft was abandoned in the desert. The remaining helicopters ran into an unexpected weather phenomenon known as a &quot;haboob&quot; (an enormous, nearly opaque cloud of fine dust). &quot;Bluebeard 5&quot; flew into the haboob, but abandoned the mission and returned to the &quot;Nimitz&quot; when electrical problems disabled flight instruments and flying without visual references proved impossible. The remaining six helicopters reached &quot;Desert One&quot;, 50 to 90 minutes behind schedule. &quot;Bluebeard 2&quot; arrived last at &quot;Desert One&quot; at 01:00 with a malfunctioning secondary hydraulic system, leaving only one hydraulic system to control the aircraft.

With only five fully serviceable helicopters now remaining to transport the men and equipment to &quot;Desert Two&quot; (minimum of six aircraft was the planned mission&#x27;s abort threshold), the various commanders reached a stalemate. Senior helicopter pilot Seiffert refused to use unsafe &quot;Bluebeard 2&quot; on the mission, while Beckwith (field commander for ground forces) refused to consider reducing his trained rescue team&#x27;s size. Kyle (the field aviation commander), therefore, recommended to Vaught that the mission be aborted. The recommendation was passed on by satellite radio to the President. After two and a half hours on the ground, the presidential abort confirmation was received.

==Collision and fire==
Fuel consumption calculations showed that the extra 90 minutes idling on the ground waiting for the abort confirmation order had made fuel critical for one of the EC-130s. When it became clear that only six helicopters would arrive at &quot;Desert One&quot;, Kyle had authorized the EC-130s to transfer 1,000 US gallons (3,800 L) from the bladders to their own main fuel tanks, but &quot;Republic 4&quot; had already expended all of its bladder fuel refueling three of the helicopters and had none to transfer. To make it to the air tanker refueling track without running out of fuel, it had to leave immediately and was already loaded with part of the Delta team. In addition, RH-53D &quot;Bluebeard 4&quot; needed additional fuel, requiring it to be moved to the opposite side of the road.

To accomplish both actions, &quot;Bluebeard 3&quot; piloted by Maj. James Schaefer had to be moved from directly behind the EC-130. The aircraft could not be moved by ground taxi and had to be moved by hover taxi (flying a short distance at low speed and altitude). A Combat Controller attempted to direct the maneuvre from in front of the aircraft but was blasted by desert sand churned up by the rotor. The Controller attempted to back away, which led &quot;Bluebeard 3&quot; pilot to mistakenly perceive that his craft was drifting backward (engulfed in a dust cloud, the pilot only had the Controller as a point of reference) and thus attempted to &quot;correct&quot; this situation by applying forward stick to maintain the same distance from the rearward moving marshaller. The RH-53D struck the EC-130&#x27;s vertical stabilizer with its main rotor and crashed into the EC-130&#x27;s wing root.

In the ensuing explosion and fire, eight servicemen died: five of the fourteen USAF aircrew in the EC-130, and three of the five USMC aircrew in the RH-53D, with only the helicopter&#x27;s pilot and co-pilot (both badly burned) surviving. After the crash, it was decided to abandon the helicopters. During the frantic evacuation to the EC-130s by the helicopter crews, unsuccessful attempts were made to retrieve their classified mission documents and destroy the aircraft. The helicopter crews boarded the EC-130s. Five RH-53D aircraft were left behind at Desert One mostly intact, some damaged by shrapnel. They could not be destroyed because they were loaded with ammunition and any fire or explosion would have endangered the EC-130s.

The EC-130s carried the remaining forces back to the intermediate airfield at Masirah Island, where two C-141 medical evacuation aircraft from the staging base at Wadi Abu Shihat, Egypt, picked up the injured personnel, helicopter crews, Rangers, and Delta Force members, and returned to Wadi Kena. The injured were then transported to Landstuhl Army Regional Medical Center in Germany. The following day, after learning about the events at Desert One from the local Iranian news, the Tehran CIA team quietly left Iran, with the Iranians unaware of their presence.

==Aftermath==

The White House announced the failed rescue operation at 01:00 a.m. the following day (25 April 1980). Iranian Army investigators found eight bodies (eight Americans) and also alleged to have found the body of an Iranian civilian. However, it has been acknowledged that the fuel tank driver near the landing site who refused to stop, and whose tanker truck exploded after being hit by an anti-tank round, managed to leap from his vehicle and escape in a nearby pickup truck which was following; it was reported that the gas tank truck and a bus with 44 civilians were the vehicles which were stopped at the opposite ends of the dirt road near the Desert One landing site when the C-130 aircraft landed. Nine caskets were made, with Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali alleging that nine Americans were killed. The American bodies, which were acknowledged to have been numbered at eight, were returned to the United States on 6 May 1980, and buried at various locations across the country. The 44 Iranian civilians taken prisoner on the bus were released and subsequently gave eyewitness accounts of the operation.

===Casualties===
The eight Americans who died included three Marines and five Air Force personnel. On 25 April 1980, Major General Robert M. Bond read a message from President Jimmy Carter at a memorial service commemorating them in Niceville, Florida. A memorial honoring them was erected in the Arlington National Cemetery and Carter attended a memorial service there with the families on 9 May. Three of the servicemen who died – Maj. Richard Bakke, Maj. Harold Lewis Jr., and Sgt. Joel Mayo – were buried in the Arlington National Cemetery in a grave marked by a common headstone, located about 25 feet from the group memorial. In addition, five servicemen were injured, One from Valdosta, Georgia (Capt. Lynn McIntosh), including USMC Majors Jim Schaefer, pilot, and Les Petty, co-pilot.

After the termination of the operation and the abandonment of equipment by the infiltration team, the Iranians became aware of the landings as well as the subsequent accident and fire. Mohammad Montazer al-Qaim, Commander of the Yazd Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) went to the scene to investigate reports from locals. At the same time, without knowing of the investigation activities of the IRGC, the Iranian Air Force conducted two observation flights over the incident area. During the first flight, two F-14s flew over the abandoned US equipment and the flight requested permission to fire on the equipment. This was refused by the Iranian command. The next day, Iranian Air Force F-4 fighter jets patrolling the area thought that the American helicopters were about to fly and they fired at the remaining American equipment with direct order from Abolhassan Banisadr (Iran&#x27;s president at the time) killing Mohammad Montazer al-Qaim.

===Political consequences===
President Carter continued to attempt to secure the hostages&#x27; release before his presidency&#x27;s end. On 20 January 1981, minutes after Carter&#x27;s term ended, the 52 US captives held in Iran were released, ending the 444-day Iran hostage crisis. US Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance, believing that the operation would not work and would only endanger the lives of the hostages, opted to resign, regardless of whether the mission was successful or not. His resignation was confirmed several days later.

Ruhollah Khomeini condemned Jimmy Carter, and in a speech after the incident, credited God with protecting Iran. He said:

The embassy hostages were subsequently scattered across Iran to preclude any second rescue attempt and were released on 20 January 1981, minutes after Ronald Reagan had taken the oath of office, after winning the 1980 election over Carter.

===Investigation and recommendations===

Retired Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James L. Holloway III led the official investigation in 1980 into the causes of the operation&#x27;s failure on behalf of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Holloway Report primarily cited deficiencies in mission planning, command and control, and inter-service operability, and provided a catalyst to reorganize the Department of Defense.

The various services&#x27; failure to cohesively work together prompted the establishment of a new multi-service organization several years later. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) became operational on 16 April 1987. Each service now has its own special operations forces under USSOCOM&#x27;s overall control.

The lack of well-trained Army helicopter pilots who were capable of the low-level night flying needed for modern special operations missions prompted the creation of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) (&quot;Night Stalkers&quot;). In addition to the 160th SOAR&#x27;s creation, the US Defense Department now trains many military helicopter pilots in low-level penetration, aerial refueling, and use of night-vision goggles. In addition to the formal report, various reasons for the mission failure have been argued, with most analysts agreeing that an excessively complex plan, poor operational planning, flawed command structure, lack of adequate pilot training and poor weather conditions were contributing factors.

==== Creation of the JCU ====
The Joint Communications Unit (JCU) is a unit of the Joint Special Operations Command charged to standardize and ensure interoperability of the communication procedures and equipment of JSOC and its subordinate units.
The JCU was created in 1980 after the failure of Eagle Claw. Its headquarters are in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

* EC-130E &quot;Republic 5&quot; which returned successfully, was retired by the USAF in June 2013 and is now on display at the Carolinas Aviation Museum.

==Second rescue plan==
Shortly after the first mission failed, planning for a second rescue mission was authorized under the name &quot;Project Honey Badger&quot;. Plans and exercises were conducted, but the manpower and aircraft requirements grew to involve nearly a battalion of troops, more than fifty aircraft, and such contingencies as transporting a 12-ton bulldozer to rapidly clear a blocked runway. Even though numerous rehearsal exercises were successful, the helicopters&#x27; failure during the first attempt resulted in the development of a subsequent concept involving only fixed-wing STOL aircraft capable of flying from the US to Iran using aerial refueling, then returning to land on an aircraft carrier for medical treatment of wounded.

The concept called &quot;Operation Credible Sport&quot;, was developed but never implemented. It called for a modified Hercules, the YMC-130H, outfitted with rocket thrusters fore and aft to allow an extremely short landing and take-off in Amjadieh Stadium. Three aircraft were modified under a rushed secret program. The first fully modified aircraft crashed during a demonstration at Duke Field at Eglin Air Force Base on 29 October 1980, when its landing braking rockets were fired too soon. The misfire caused a hard touchdown that tore off the starboard wing and started a fire. All on board survived without injury. The impending change of administration in the White House forced this project&#x27;s abandonment.

<text>Angels Flight is a landmark and historic narrow-gauge funicular railway in the Bunker Hill district of Downtown Los Angeles, California. It has two funicular cars, named &quot;Olivet&quot; and &quot;Sinai&quot;, that run in opposite directions on a shared cable. The tracks cover a distance of over a vertical gain of .

The funicular has operated on two different sites, using the same cars and station elements. The original location, with trackage along the side of Third Street Tunnel and connecting Hill Street and Olive Street, operated from 1901 until 1969, when its site was cleared for redevelopment.

The current location opened half a block south of the original location in 1996, mid-block between 3rd and 4th Streets, with tracks connecting Hill Street and California Plaza. It was shut down in 2001 following a fatal accident and reopened in 2010. It was closed again during June and July 2011, and then again after a minor derailment incident in September 2013. The investigation of this latter incident led to the discovery of potentially serious safety problems in both the design and the operation of the funicular.

Before the 2013 service suspension, the cost of a one-way ride was 50 cents (25 cents for Metro pass holders). Although it was marketed primarily as a tourist novelty, it was frequently used by local workers to travel between the Downtown Historic Core and Bunker Hill. In 2015, the executive director of the nearby REDCAT arts center described the railroad as an important &quot;economic link,&quot; and there was pressure for the city to fund and re-open the railroad. After safety enhancements were completed, Angels Flight reopened for public service in August 2017, charging $1 for a one-way ride (50 cents for TAP card users).

==History==
===Original location===
Angels Flight funicular was built as the &quot;Los Angeles Incline Railway&quot; in 1901, with financing from J. W. Eddy. It began at the west corner of Hill Street at Third, and ran for two blocks uphill (northwestward) to its Olive Street terminus. The service consisted of two vermillion &quot;boarding stations&quot; and two cars, named &quot;Sinai&quot; and &quot;Olivet&quot;, alternately pulled up the steep incline by metal cables powered by engines at the upper Olive Street station. The downhill car descended by gravity alone. An archway labeled &quot;Angels Flight&quot; greeted passengers on the Hill Street entrance, which became the official name of the railway in 1912 when the Funding Company of California purchased it from its founders.

The original Angels Flight was a conventional funicular, with both cars connected to the same haulage cable and no track brakes in case of cable failure; a separate safety cable would be activated in a break. It operated for 68 years with a good safety record, with three notable incidents: a derailment with a single female passenger in 1913, a sleeping salesman being dragged several yards by a car in 1937, and a sailor walking up the tracks being killed in 1943.

A total of seven companies operated the railroad at its original location. In 1912 Colonel Eddy sold it to the Funding Company of Los Angeles, which sold it to Continental Securities Company in 1914. Robert W. Moore, an engineer for Continental Securities, and the railway&#x27;s general manager since 1914, purchased the line in 1946. In 1952, Moore retired, and sold Angels Flight to Lester B. Moreland, an electrical engineer with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and Byron Linville, a prominent banker at Security First National Bank. Moore had gotten to know Moreland and Linville over his many years and believed the pair were earnest about preserving the history of the railway and capably maintaining its operation. The following year Moreland&#x27;s family bought out Linville&#x27;s interest and became sole stockholder. In 1962 condemnation proceedings instigated by Los Angeles forced Moreland to sell to the city, whose redevelopment agency hired Oliver &amp; Williams Elevator Company to run the line until it was shut down on May 18, 1969. Dismantling began the following day, and the cars were hauled off to a warehouse. The railroad&#x27;s arch, station house, drinking fountain, and other artifacts were taken to an outdoor storage yard in Gardena, California.

In November 1952, the Beverly Hills Parlor of the Native Daughters of the Golden West erected a plaque to commemorate fifty years of service by the railway. The plaque reads:

In 1962, the city&#x27;s new Cultural Heritage Board (today its Cultural Heritage Commission) designated five sites it regarded as &quot;threatened&quot; as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments, with Angel&#x27;s Flight listed as No. 4.

===Dismantling===

The railway was closed on May 17 or May 18, 1969, when the Bunker Hill area underwent a controversial total redevelopment, which destroyed and displaced a community of almost 22,000 working-class families who were renting rooms in architecturally significant but run-down buildings; the demolished residences were replaced with a contemporary mixed-use district of high-rise commercial buildings and modern apartment and condominium complexes. Both of the Angels Flight cars, &quot;Sinai&quot; and &quot;Olivet&quot;, were then placed in storage at 1200 S. Olive Street, Los Angeles. This was the location of Sid and Linda Kastner&#x27;s United Business Interiors. At this location, the Kastners maintained &quot;The Bandstand,&quot; a private museum. The Bandstand featured antique, coin-operated musical instruments where one of the cars (&quot;Sinai&quot;) was on display in the museum. &quot;Olivet&quot; was stored in the garage of the building. They were stored at this location for 27 years at no charge in anticipation of the railway&#x27;s restoration and reopening, which according to the city&#x27;s Redevelopment Agency, was originally slated to take place within two years.

===Reconstruction===
After being stored for 27 years, the funicular was rebuilt and reopened by the newly formed Angels Flight Railway Foundation on February 24, 1996, half a block south of the original site. Although the original cars, &quot;Sinai&quot; and &quot;Olivet&quot;, were used, a new track and haulage system was designed and built—a redesign which had unfortunate consequences five years later. As rebuilt, the funicular retained its general length and approximately 33% grade.

As with the original line, car movement was controlled by an operator inside the upper station house, who was responsible for visually determining that the track and vehicles were clear for movement, closing the platform gates, starting the cars moving, monitoring the operation of the funicular cars, observing car stops at both stations, and collecting fares from passengers. The cars themselves did not carry any staff members. Angels Flight was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 13, 2000.

===2001 accident===

On February 1, 2001, Angels Flight had a serious accident when car &quot;Sinai&quot;, approaching the upper station, instead rolled downhill uncontrollably, and collided into &quot;Olivet&quot; near the lower station. The accident killed an 83-year-old man, injured his wife and seven others, and caused serious damage to the funicular.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted an investigation into the accident, and determined that the probable cause was the improper design and construction of the funicular drive, and the failure of the various regulatory bodies to ensure that the railway system conformed to initial safety design specifications and known funicular safety standards. The NTSB further remarked that the company that designed and built the drive, control, braking, and haul systems, Lift Engineering/Yantrak, was no longer in business, and that the whereabouts of the company&#x27;s principal was unknown.

Unlike the original design, which had a safety cable, track brakes, and the cars connected to one-another to counter-balance their loads, the new arrangement used a separate haulage system for each car, with its drive motor connected to its service brake by a gear train. When &quot;Sinai&#x27;s&quot; gear train failed it had no service brake or balancing load, either of which would have prevented the accident. Compounding this, emergency brakes that acted on the rim of each haulage drum were inoperative on both cars due to inadequate maintenance. The NTSB was unable to identify another funicular worldwide that operated without either a safety cable or track brakes.

Records indicate that the emergency brake had been inoperative for 17 to 26 months following the mis-installation of a normally closed hydraulic solenoid valve in place of a normally open one, which had burned out.

During the period that the emergency braking system was not operating, the braking system was tested daily – using a faulty methodology which engaged the service brake and emergency brake simultaneously, leaving no way to tell if the emergency brake was functioning without looking at the brake pads or hydraulic pressure gauges during the test. It was always performed with the &quot;Sinai&quot; car traveling uphill, which meant that when the power was cut and the brakes applied (as part of the test), &quot;Sinai&quot;″s momentum caused the car to continue moving uphill a short distance (slackening the cable) and then to roll back from gravity, jerking the cable tight.

If the emergency brakes had been functional, they would have caught the car when the cable snapped tight, but without them the force of the daily jerk caused by the test was directed through the gear train&#x27;s spline (that ultimately failed) and then to the service brake. In addition, it was found that the original design called for the spline to be made of AISI 1018 steel on one drawing and of AISI 8822 steel on a different one, but it is unlikely that this ambiguity in the design contributed to the accident. However, regular analysis of gear box oil-samples was discontinued in May 1998, despite the company contracted to perform the tests advising that the rising particulate level in the samples warranted more frequent testing.

Besides the design failures in the haulage system, the Angels Flight setup was also criticized by the NTSB for the lack of gates on the cars and the absence of a parallel walkway for emergency evacuation.

====Evaluation====
The death and injuries could have been avoided if any one of the following had taken place:
===Repair===
On November 1, 2008, both of the repaired and restored Angels Flight cars, &quot;Sinai&quot; and &quot;Olivet&quot;, were put back on their tracks, and on January 16, 2009, testing began on the railway. On November 20, 2009, another step in the approval process was achieved. Finally, on March 10, 2010, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved the safety certificate for the railroad to begin operating again.

The new drive and safety system completely replaced the faulty system that was the cause of the fatal 2001 accident. Like the original Angels Flight design and most traditional funicular systems, the new drive system incorporates a single main haulage cable, with one car attached to each end. Also like the original design, a second safety cable is utilized. To further enhance safety, unlike the original design, each car now has a rail brake system, as a backup to the main backup emergency brakes on each bull-wheel. Another added safety feature is an independent evacuation motor to move the cars should the main motor fail for any reason.

===Reopening and temporary closing===
Angels Flight reopened to the public for riding on March 15, 2010, and local media covered the event with interest. Only a month after re-opening, Angels Flight had had over 59,000 riders. It connected the Historic Core and Broadway commercial district with the hilltop Bunker Hill California Plaza urban park and the Museum of Contemporary Art – MOCA. The cost of a one-way ride at that time was 50 cents (25 cents with TAP card).

On June 10, 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission ordered Angels Flight to immediately cease operations due to wear on its cars&#x27; fifteen-year-old wheels. Inspectors determined they needed replacing. The railway reopened on July 5, 2011, after eight new custom-made wheels were installed.

===2013 accident===
On September 5, 2013, one car derailed near the middle of the guideway. One passenger was on board the derailed car, and five passengers were on board the other car. Although there were no injuries, passengers had to be rescued from the cars by firefighters. The brake safety system had been &quot;intentionally&quot; bypassed using a small tree branch. A 2014 brief by the NTSB said that the &quot;probable cause of the September 5, 2013, accident was the intentional bypass of the funicular safety system with Angels Flight management knowledge; and Angels Flight management continuation of revenue operations despite prolonged, and repeated, unidentified system safety shutdowns.&quot; The NTSB also noted a problem with the basic design: &quot;The car body and the wheel-axle assembly are not articulated.&quot; The passing section of the track involves a short turning section, which allows the cars to pass each other. The axles did not turn to follow the track, resulting in the wheel flanges grinding against the rail, causing excessive wheel wear. This problem, combined with safety system problems which caused unwanted track brake deployment, resulted in a derailment.

===2017 reopening===
Plans to bring the railway back into service began in January 2017. Safety upgrades were made to the doors of the cars, and an evacuation walkway was added adjacent to the track. These enhancements were made by ACS Infrastructure Development and SENER through an agreement with Angels Flight Railway Foundation, in exchange for a share of the funicular&#x27;s revenue over the next three decades. Angels Flight reopened for public service on August 31, 2017.

==In popular culture==
===Film, television, and video===
Angels Flight has appeared in more than 100 films. Angels Flight&#x27;s earliest appearance on film is believed to be &quot;Their Ups and Downs&quot; (1914), starring Eddie Lyons, Victoria Forde, and Lee Moran. Other early appearances include: &quot;Good Night, Nurse!&quot; (1916), &quot;All Jazzed Up&quot; (1920), &quot;The Impatient Maiden&quot; (1932), &quot;The Unfaithful&quot; (1940), &quot;Hollow Triumph&quot; (1948), &quot;M&quot; (1951), &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1952), &quot;Cry of the Hunted&quot; (1953), &quot;Bunker Hill: A Tale of Urban Renewal&quot; (1956), &quot;The Exiles&quot; (1961), &quot;The Money Trap&quot; (1965), &quot;Angel&#x27;s Flight&quot; (1965), and &quot;They Came to Rob Las Vegas&quot; (1968). It appeared as a landmark rather than an active filming location in the &quot;Night Has a Thousand Eyes&quot; (1948), &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1949), &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954), &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1955), &quot;Indestructible Man&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot; (1963). &quot;Angels Flight Railway&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Last Day of Angels Flight&quot; (1969) both center on the railway&#x27;s closure in 1969. It closed again in 2013, but reopened for a single day to serve as a filming location for &quot;La La Land&quot; (2016), after which safety officials barred it from use as a filming location. It was reopened for public use in 2017, and can be seen in &quot;The Saint&quot;.

The railway is present in a 1953 episode of &quot;Boston Blackie,&quot; and in the only color episode of the original &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Twice-Told Twist&quot; in 1966. It also appears in the Amazon Studios show &quot;Bosch&quot; (2018), which is based on Michael Connelly&#x27;s book &quot;Angels Flight&quot;.

Other television show appearances include: in the 1969 episode &quot;Narcotics DR-21&quot; of &quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; (2010), &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (2010), and in the &quot;Runaways&quot; episode &quot;Old School&quot; (2018). The original Angels Flight is featured in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; remake (2020).

Angels Flight appears as an interactive component of the video games &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot; (2005) and &quot;L.A. Noire&quot; (2011).

===Literature, visual arts, and music===
The first book to be named &quot;Angel&#x27;s Flight&quot; in reference to the railway was Don Ryan&#x27;s 1927 novel. It is used by characters in Raymond Chandler&#x27;s &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; (1938) and &quot;The High Window&quot; (1942); in Michael Connelly&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Angels Flight&quot;; and in Nick Carter&#x27;s 1967 &quot;The Red Guard&quot;. The railway is illustrated and at the center of events in &quot;Piccolo&#x27;s Prank&quot; by Leo Politi. Millard Sheets&#x27; 1931 oil painting &quot;Angel&#x27;s Flight&quot;, which shows two young women on the looking down from the upper platform, is in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art&#x27;s permanent collection.

David Woodard composed &quot;An Elegy for Two Angels&quot; (2001) in honor of Leon Praport, the sole person killed in the 2001 accident. Praport&#x27;s wife, who survived the derailing, received an autographed score. The funicular is referenced in &quot;L.A. (My Town)&quot; by Four Tops (1970), &quot;Strange Season&quot; by Michael Penn (1992), and &quot;Aquatic Mouth Dance&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers (2022). The music video for &quot;Icy&quot; (2019) by ITZY contains dance scenes inside the Angels Flight. Michael Penn&#x27;s album &quot;Free-for-All&quot; (2019) shows Angels Flight on the cover.

<text>Moses the Black (; ; ; 330–405), also known as Moses the Strong, Moses the Robber, and Moses the Ethiopian, was an ascetic hieromonk in Egypt in the fourth century AD, and a Desert Father. He is highly venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Church. According to stories about him, he converted from a life of crime to one of asceticism. He is mentioned in Sozomen&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, written about 70 years after Moses&#x27;s death.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Moses was a slave of a government official in Egypt until he was dismissed for theft and suspected murder. He then roamed the Nile Valley with an infamous and violent gang of 75 robbers.
Moses was a man of huge physical stature, strength and courage, and became leader of this gang of robbers that became a social menace and living terror to the communities where they roamed.

===Conversion to Christianity===
On one occasion, a barking dog prevented Moses from carrying out a robbery, so he swore vengeance on the owner. In a second attempt, with a sword in his mouth, Moses swam across the Nile towards the owner&#x27;s hut. The owner, again alerted, was able to hide, and the frustrated Moses stole four of his sheep and took them to slaughter, selling their fleece in exchange for wine. Attempting to hide from local authorities, he took shelter with some monks in a colony in the desert of Wadi El Natrun, then called Scetis, near Alexandria. The dedication of their lives, as well as their peace and contentment, influenced Moses deeply. He soon gave up his old way of life, became a Christian, was baptized and joined the monastic community at Scetis.

===Monastic life===
Moses had a rather difficult time adjusting to regular monastic discipline. His flair for adventure remained with him. Attacked by a group of robbers in his desert cell, Moses fought back, overpowered the intruders, and dragged them to the chapel where the other monks were at prayer. He told the brothers that he did not think it was Christian to hurt the robbers and asked what he should do with them. The robbers themselves repented and joined the community as brothers afterwards. Moses was zealous in all he did, but became discouraged when he concluded he was not perfect enough. Feeling overcome by despair and once again tempted by his former passions, early one morning, Isidore, abbot of the monastery, took Moses to the roof. Together they watched the first rays of dawn come over the horizon, and Isidore said to Moses, &quot;Only slowly do the rays of the sun drive away the night and usher in a new day, and thus, only slowly does one become a perfect contemplative.

Moses proved to be effective as a prophetic spiritual leader. The abbot ordered the brothers to fast during a particular week. Some brothers came to Moses, and he prepared a meal for them. Neighboring monks reported to the abbot that Moses was breaking the fast. When they came to confront Moses, they changed their minds, saying, &quot;You did not keep a human commandment, but it was so that you might keep the divine commandment of hospitality.&quot; Some see in this account one of the earliest allusions to the Paschal fast, which developed at this time.

When a brother committed a fault and Moses was invited to a meeting to discuss an appropriate penance, Moses refused to attend. When he was again called to the meeting, Moses took a leaking jug filled with water and carried it on his shoulder. Another version of the story has him carrying a basket filled with sand. When he arrived at the meeting place, the others asked why he was carrying the jug. He replied, &quot;My sins run out behind me and I do not see them, but today I am coming to judge the errors of another.&quot; On hearing this, the assembled brothers forgave the erring monk.

Moses became the spiritual leader of a colony of hermits in the Western Desert. Later, he was ordained a priest.

===Death===
At about age 75, about the year 405 AD, word came that the Mazices, a group of Berbers, planned to attack the monastery. The brothers wanted to defend themselves, but Moses forbade it. He told them to retreat, rather than take up weapons. Citing that a violent death was the appropriate death for a former robber—&quot;All who take the sword will perish by the sword&quot;—he opted to remain behind. He was joined by seven others, and they were together martyred by the bandits on 24 Paoni (July 1).

A different story of Abba Moses&#x27; death is related in &quot;The Paradise of the Holy Fathers&quot;:31. Abba Poemen said: Abba Moses asked Abba Zechariah a question when he was about to die, and said unto him, &quot;Father, is it good that we should hold our peace?&quot; And Zechariah said unto him, &quot;Yea, my son, hold thy peace.&quot; And at the time of his death, whilst Abba Isidore was sitting with him, Abba Moses looked up to heaven, and said, &quot;Rejoice and be glad, O my son Zechariah, for the gates of heaven have been opened.&quot;

==Legacy==
Moses was highly praised by his contemporaries. In his 5th century AD &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, written about 70 years after Moses&#x27;s death, Hermias Sozomen sums up Moses&#x27;s legacy as follows:

A modern interpretation honors Moses the Ethiopian as an apostle of non-violence. His relics and major shrine are found today at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the Paromeos Monastery, a Coptic Orthodox monastery located in Wadi El Natrun in Egypt.

He was a spiritual guide to many a young monk and to many Christians over the generations. Some of his well-known teachings include: 

&quot;Do no harm to anyone; do not think anything bad in your heart towards anyone; do not scorn the man who does evil, do not put confidence in him who does wrong to his neighbor; do not rejoice with him who injures his neighbor. This is what dying to one’s neighbor means.&quot;

“When someone is occupied with his own faults, he does not see those of neighbor.”

&quot;If a man’s deeds are not in harmony with his prayer, he labors in vain.”

<doc id="354156" wikidata="Q587204" url="?curid=354156" title="Maeda Toshitsune">
<text>was an early-Edo period Japanese samurai, and the 2nd &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kaga Domain in the Hokuriku region of Japan, and the 3rd hereditary chieftain of the Maeda clan. Toshitsune was a brother of Maeda Toshinaga and a son of Maeda Toshiie. He was the wealthiest &quot;daimyō&quot; within the Tokugawa shogunate, and his domain encompassed Etchū, Kaga, and Noto provinces. His childhood name was Saruchiyo (猿千代) later &quot;Inuchiyo&quot; (犬千代).

Toshitsune was the fourth son of Maeda Toshiie, and was born to a concubine when Toshiie was aged 54 and was on campaign with Toyotomi Hideyoshi at Nagoya Castle during the Japanese invasion of Korea. He was largely raised by a retainer, Maeda Nagatane and was initially called Toshimitsu (利光). In 1600 he married Tama-hime, a daughter of Tokugawa Hidetada in a political marriage intended to secure the position of the Maeda clan with the growing power of the Tokugawa. In 1605, his elder brother Maeda Toshinaga officially retired, and appointed Toshitsune as his heir and &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kaga Domain; however, Toshinaga continued to control the domain until his death. In 1614 and 1615, Toshitsune led the Maeda army at the Siege of Osaka, forming one of the largest components of the Tokugawa forces. After the final defeat of the Toyotomi clan, Tokugawa Ieyasu offered the Maeda clan the four provinces of Shikoku island in exchange for their existing three provinces in the Hokuriku region, but Toshitsune declined.

In 1616, Toshitsune met with a diplomatic mission from Ayutthaya in Kanazawa, which due to the death of Tokugawa Ieyasu was not allowed to continue on to Edo.

He changed his name to Toshitsune in 1629. As Toshitsune, &quot;daimyō&quot; Toshitsune worked to allay fears by the Tokugawa shogunate of Kaga Domain&#x27;s size and economic strength. He kept his son and heir Maeda Mitsutaka in Edo as a potential hostage, and arranged a political marriage of his son to a daughter of Tokugawa Yorinobu of Mito Domain. He retired in 1639, relocating to Komatsu and ordered that the domain be divided, with 100,000 &quot;koku&quot; going to his younger son Maeda Toshitsugu to form Toyama Domain, 70,000 &quot;koku&quot; going go his third son, Maeda Toshiharu to form Daishōji Domain, and 200,000 &quot;koku&quot; to support his own retirement. He died in 1658 at the age of 64, and his grave is at the Maeda cemetery at Nodayama in Kanazawa.

<text>The was a battle during the Sengoku period (16th century) of Japan.
Marune was a frontier fortress in the possession of Oda Nobunaga. 

Matsudaira Motoyasu (who would later come to be known as Tokugawa Ieyasu) was at the time a forced retainer of the Imagawa, captured the fortress as part of the Imagawa advance that led to the fateful Battle of Okehazama in 1560. Throughout Motoyasu&#x27;s siege of the castle, he and his men were not present at the Battle of Okehazama where Imagawa Yoshimoto was killed in Nobunaga&#x27;s surprise assault. 

In this siege, Motoyasu made good use of concentrated arquebus fire. Later during the siege, Sakuma Morishige the commander of the fortress, was killed by a bullet.

<text>Gaétan T. Boucher (born May 10, 1958) is a former Canadian speed skating Olympic champion.

==Biography==
Boucher first trained in ice hockey, the leading sport in Canada but then changed to speed skating after winning a national title in 1972. In 1976 he took part in his first Olympics, finishing sixth in the 1000 m and setting an Olympic record in the process. In 1980 he was second in the same event, after Eric Heiden (who won all the gold medals at that event), collecting one of only two Canadian medals at those Games. He broke his ankle and had a long illness in 1983, but recovered for the 1984 Olympics, where he was the Canadian flag bearer and won three medals, the most medals for a Canadian athlete at one Olympics (since bettered by Cindy Klassen). With his gold medals in the 1000 m and 1500 m events he also became the first Canadian male to win an individual gold medal at the Winter Olympics. He retired shortly after the 1988 Games, where his best result was fifth place in the 1000 m.

A champion at the 1984 World Sprint Championships and winner of six World Championship events from 1981 to 1985, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1983 and promoted to Officer the following year. In 1984 he won the Oscar Mathisen Award, given annually for exemplary speed skating performance, and the Lou Marsh Trophy, given annually to Canada&#x27;s top athlete and was inducted into the Canada Sports Hall of Fame. The following year was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec. Since his retirement, he has worked as a French-language broadcaster and designed skates for Bauer. He was ranked number 10 on Canada&#x27;s Athletes of the 20th Century and continues to inspire speed skaters in Canada.

A four-time Olympic medalist, Boucher was awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada&#x27;s outstanding male athlete of 1984. He was named number 10 on the list of Canada&#x27;s Athletes of the 20th Century. In 1983, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 1984. In 1985, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec.

Boucher held the Canadian record for most medals won at a single Olympics, winning three at the 1984 Winter Olympics. This was surpassed by Cindy Klassen at the 2006 Winter Olympics, who won five. He was World Sprint Champion in 1984, as well as runner-up four times.

Boucher&#x27;s career coincided with that of Eric Heiden, and Boucher finished runner-up to Heiden in both the 1979 and 1980 World Sprint Championship. After Heiden&#x27;s retirement at age 22, Boucher was among the favourites for the 1981 World Sprint Championship, but after the first day&#x27;s events he was third. He then crashed out of the championship with a fall on the 500 m, and despite beating champion Frode Rønning by 1.61 seconds on the final 1000 m, he had no chance to finish anything but last. Three years later, however, he did win the title, requiring to beat Sergey Khlebnikov by 0.47 seconds on the final 1000 m; he won by 0.49 and secured the title by 0.01 of a samalog point, capping a season which also included two Olympic golds.

He is the father of ice hockey player Jean-Francois Boucher.

<text>From 1989 through 1991, Poland engaged in a democratic transition which put an end to the Polish People&#x27;s Republic and led to the foundation of a democratic government, known as the Third Polish Republic (Polish: &quot;III Rzeczpospolita Polska&quot;), following the First and Second Polish Republic. After ten years of democratic consolidation, Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union on 1 May 2004.

==Background==
Tension grew between the people of Poland and its communist government, as with the rest of the Eastern bloc as the influence of the Soviet Union faded. With the advent of &quot;perestroika&quot; in the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev, the opportunity arose to change the system of government, after the harsh period of martial law (1981-83) imposed by general Wojciech Jaruzelski.

==Round Table Agreement and democratic transition==

The government&#x27;s inability to forestall Poland&#x27;s economic decline led to waves of strikes across the country in April, May and August 1988. In an attempt to take control of the situation, the contemporary government gave &quot;de facto&quot; recognition to the Solidarity union, and Interior Minister Czesław Kiszczak began talks with Solidarity&#x27;s leader Lech Wałęsa on August 31. These talks broke down in October, but a new series of negotiations, the &quot;round table&quot; talks, began in February 1989. These talks produced an agreement in April for partly open parliamentary elections. The June election produced a Sejm (lower house), in which one-third of the seats went to the communist party and one-third went to the two parties which had hitherto been their coalition partners. The remaining one-third of the seats in the Sejm and all those in the Senate were freely contested; the majority of these were by candidates supported by Solidarity. The failure of the communist party at the polls produced a political crisis. The round-table agreement called for a communist president, and on July 19, the National Assembly, with the support of a number of Solidarity deputies, elected General Wojciech Jaruzelski to that office. However, two attempts by the communists to form governments failed.

On August 19, President Jaruzelski asked journalist/Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki to form a government; on September 12, the Sejm voted approval of Prime Minister Mazowiecki and his cabinet. For the first time in more than 40 years, Poland had a government led by non-communists.
In December 1989, the Sejm approved the government&#x27;s reform program to transform the Polish economy rapidly from centrally planned to free-market, amended the constitution to eliminate references to the &quot;leading role&quot; of the Communist Party, and renamed the country the &quot;Republic of Poland&quot;. The communist Polish United Workers&#x27; Party dissolved itself in January 1990, creating in its place a new party, Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland. Most of the property of the former Communist Party was turned over to the state.

The May 1990 local elections were entirely free. Candidates supported by Solidarity&#x27;s Citizens&#x27; Committees won most of the elections they contested, although voter turnout was only a little over 40%. The cabinet was reshuffled in July 1990; the national defence and interior affairs ministers (hold-overs from the previous communist government) were among those replaced.

In October 1990, the constitution was amended to curtail the term of President Jaruzelski. In December, Lech Wałęsa became the first popularly elected President of Poland.

==Wałęsa Presidency (1990–1995)==
In the early 1990s, Poland made progress towards achieving a democratic government and a market economy. In November 1990, Lech Wałęsa was elected president for a 5-year term. Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, at Wałęsa&#x27;s request, formed a government and served as its prime minister until October 1991, introducing world prices and greatly expanding the scope of private enterprise.

Poland&#x27;s first free parliamentary elections were held in 1991. More than 100 parties participated, representing the full spectrum of political views. No single party received more than 13% of the total vote. The government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski was the first fully free and democratic Polish government since 1926. This cabinet was supported by the Kaczyński brothers. Olszewski was replaced by Hanna Suchocka as the first woman Prime Minister of Poland in 1992 after Janusz Korwin-Mikke wanted all members of the Sejm who had cooperated with the communist secret police to be revealed. After a rough start, 1993 saw the second group of elections, and the first parliament to serve a full term. The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) received the largest share of votes. Also in 1993 the Soviet Northern Group of Forces finally left Poland.
After the election, the SLD and Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL) formed a governing coalition. Waldemar Pawlak, leader of the junior partner PSL, became prime minister. Relations between President Wałęsa and the Prime Minister remained poor throughout the Pawlak government, with the President charging Pawlak with furthering personal and party interests while neglecting matters of state importance. Following a number of scandals implicating Pawlak and increasing political tension over control of the armed forces, Wałęsa demanded Pawlak&#x27;s resignation in January 1995. A crisis resulted and the coalition removed Pawlak from office and replaced him with the SLD&#x27;s Józef Oleksy as the new prime minister.

==Kwaśniewski Presidency (1995–2005)==

In November 1995, Poland held its second post-war free presidential elections. SLD leader Aleksander Kwaśniewski defeated Wałęsa by a narrow margin—51.7% to 48.3%. Soon after Wałęsa&#x27;s defeat, Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski accused then-Prime Minister Oleksy of a longtime collaboration with Soviet and later Russian intelligence. In the ensuing political crisis, Oleksy resigned. For his successor, The SLD-PSL coalition turned to deputy Sejm speaker Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz — who was linked to, but not a member of, the SLD. Polish prosecutors subsequently decided that there was insufficient evidence to charge Oleksy, and a parliamentary commission decided in November 1996 that the Polish intelligence services may have violated rules of procedure in gathering evidence in the Oleksy case.

Poland&#x27;s new Constitution of 1997 redefined the concept of the Polish nation in civic rather than ethnic terms. Article 35 guaranteed the rights of national and ethnic minorities, while other provisions prohibited discrimination and political organizations that spread racial hatred.

In 1997 parliamentary elections two parties with roots in the Solidarity movement — Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and the Freedom Union (UW) — won 261 of the 460 seats in the Sejm and formed a coalition government. Jerzy Buzek of the AWS became prime minister. The AWS and the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) held the majority of the seats in the Sejm. Marian Krzaklewski was the leader of the AWS, and Leszek Miller led the SLD. In April 1997, the first post-communist Constitution of Poland was finalized, and in July put into effect. In June 2000, UW withdrew from the governing coalition, leaving AWS at the helm of a minority government.

In the presidential election of 2000, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, the incumbent former leader of the post-communist SLD, was re-elected in the first round of voting, with 53.9% of the popular vote. Second place, with only 17.3%, went to Andrzej Olechowski. It is thought that the opposition campaign was hindered by their inability to put forward a charismatic (or even a single major) candidate, as well as falling support for the centre-right AWS government. This was related to internal friction in the ruling parliamentary coalition.

The 1997 Constitution and the reformed administrative division of 1999 required a revision of the electoral system, which was passed in April 2001. The most important changes included:
# the final liquidation of the party list (previously, some of the members of parliament were elected from a party list, based on nationwide voter support, rather than from local constituencies),
# modification of the method of allocating seats to the Sainte-Laguë method, which gave less premium to large parties. The latter change was reverted to the d&#x27;Hondt method in 2002.
In the September 2001 parliamentary elections, the SLD triumphed on the back of voter disillusionment with the AWS government and internal bickering within that bloc. So much so that this former ruling party did not enter parliament due to falling below the 8% threshold for coalitions. (Symptomatically, they had failed to form a formal political party, which has only a 5% threshold, and formally remained a &quot;coalition&quot; of parties).

The SLD went on to form a coalition with the agrarian PSL and leftist Labour Union (UP), with Leszek Miller as prime minister. This government had the support of 256 of the 460 seats in the Sejm.

A leading issue in the subsequent years was negotiations with the European Union regarding accession and internal preparation for this. Poland joined the EU on 1 May 2004. Both President Kwaśniewski and the government were vocal in their support for this cause. The only party decidedly opposed to EU entry was the populist right-wing League of Polish Families (LPR).

Despite broad popular support for joining the EU, which was considered an overriding issue, the government rapidly lost popularity due to incompetence on various issues (e.g. building of motorways, and a botched reform of the health system and numerous corruption scandals). The most famous of these were the Rywin affair (an alleged attempt to interfere with the legislative process, so named after the main suspect Lew Rywin) -- this case was investigated by a special parliamentary committee, whose proceedings were televised and widely followed), and the (government ministers informed friends with links to an organized crime about an impending raid).

In March some prominent SLD politicians and MPs (including the then Speaker of the Sejm: Marek Borowski) formed a split, creating the new Social Democracy of Poland party. The cabinet led by Leszek Miller resigned on May 2, 2004, just after Poland joined the European Union.

A new cabinet was formed, with Marek Belka as prime minister. After two initial unsuccessful attempts, it eventually won parliamentary support (24 June) and governed until the parliamentary elections in late 2005. Several of the new ministers were seen as non-partisan experts, and the government was considered a marked improvement upon the previous cabinet. This did not carry over into any rise in voter support for the SLD, however, even despite an economic upturn through 2005. Part of the reason is that this government was considered to be largely apart from the party backbone, and only held in an office by the fear of early elections by the majority of the MPs.

A fear not unfounded, as the SLD saw its support drop by three-fourths to only 11% in the subsequent elections.

==Lech Kaczyński Presidency (2005–2010)==
===PiS-led coalition government (2005–2007)===
In the autumn of 2005 Poles voted in both parliamentary and presidential elections. September&#x27;s parliamentary poll was expected to produce a coalition of two centre-right parties, PiS (Law and Justice) and PO (Civic Platform). During the increasingly bitter campaign, however, PiS launched a strong attack on the liberal economic policies of their allies and overtook PO in opinion polls. PiS eventually gained 27% of votes cast and became the largest party in the Sejm ahead of PO on 24%. The out-going ruling party, the social democratic SLD, achieved just 11%. This continues the trend that in every free parliamentary election the Polish electorate has voted against the current government, turning to the left in 1993 and 2001, and to the right in 1997 and 2005.

Presidential elections in October followed a similar script. The early favourite, Donald Tusk, leader of the PO, saw his opinion poll lead slip away and was beaten 54% to 46% in the second round by the PiS candidate Lech Kaczyński (one of the twins, founders of the party).

Both elections were blighted by low turn-outs: only 51% in the second and deciding round of the presidential election and just over 40% in the parliamentary election. The suggested cause of the low turnout is popular disillusionment with politicians.

Coalition talks ensued simultaneously with the presidential elections. However, the severity of the campaign attacks and the willingness of PiS to court the populist vote had soured the relationship between the two largest parties and made the creation of a stable coalition impossible. The ostensible stumbling blocks were the insistence of PiS that it controls all aspects of law enforcement: the Ministries of Justice and Internal Affairs, and the special forces; as well as the forcing through of a PiS candidate for the head of the Sejm with help of several smaller populist parties. The PO decided to go into opposition.

PiS then formed a minority government with the previously little-known Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz as prime minister instead of party leader, Jarosław Kaczyński who remained influential in the background. This government relied on the tacit and rather stable support of smaller populist and agrarian parties (Samoobrona, LPR) to govern.

The new government enjoyed quite strong public support (which was expected during the first few months after the election), while the popularity of the populist parties giving it support, significantly waned. A parliamentary crisis appeared to loom in January 2006, with these small populist parties fearing that PiS was about to force new elections (on which they would lose out) by using the pretext of failing to pass the budget within the constitutional timeframe. However, a crisis was abated.

In May 2006 a coalition agreement for the majority government was formed between PiS, Samoobrona and League of Polish Families (LPR). In July 2006, following a rift with his party leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, Marcinkiewicz tendered his resignation as prime minister and was replaced by Jarosław Kaczyński. The following 15 months were erratic and not without controversy, as the government pursued lustration policies, established a Central Anticorruption Bureau with far-reaching powers and was embroiled in a case relating to the suicide of an MP who was under investigation for corruption. The new government also modified Polish foreign relations relating to the EU by adopting a more eurosceptical stance, where Polish governments had in the past adopted a very pro-EU position.

The uneasy alliance between the three coalition partners came to a head in July 2007 when Samoobrona leader, Andrzej Lepper, was dismissed from his position as Minister for Agriculture following a secret investigation by the Central Anticorruption Bureau (CBA) which attempted to link him and his department to corruptive practices. Lepper protested his innocence and claimed to have been the victim of a politically motivated &#x27;sting&#x27; operation, initiated by PM Kaczynski and PiS. The coalition agreement collapsed over the following month, with both the LPR and Samoobrona levelling accusations against PiS. In September, the Sejm voted to dissolve itself (supported by PiS but opposed by Samoobrona and LPR), paving the way for elections in October.

===First Donald Tusk government (2007–2014)===

In the October parliamentary elections, the Civic Platform (PO), the largest opposition party, gained more than 41% of the popular vote. PiS&#x27;s vote increased, from 2005, but insufficiently to gain reelection, whilst both Samoobrona and LPR lost all representation, each having gained only a little over 1% of the vote. PO proceeded to form a majority governing coalition with the agrarian Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL), with PO leader, Donald Tusk, taking over the prime ministerial office in November 2007.

On August 14, 2008, the United States and Poland agreed to have 10, two-stage Orbital Sciences Corp missile interceptors placed in Poland, as part of a missile shield to defend Europe and the US from a possible missile attack by Iran. In return, the US agreed to move a battery of MIM-104 Patriot missiles to Poland. The missile battery would be staffed - at least temporarily - by US Military personnel. The US also pledged to defend Poland - a NATO member - quicker than NATO would in the event of an attack. After the agreement was announced, Russian officials - who viewed the missile shield as a threat - released a statement indirectly threatening Poland, and said that the missile defence system would greatly harm future US/Russia relations.

Russia later threatened nuclear attack against &quot;new US assets in Europe&quot;, referring to Poland. The US has pledged to back Warsaw in the event of Russian aggression towards Poland.

==Komorowski Presidency (2010–2015)==

On 10 April 2010, numerous high-ranking Polish statesmen died in the Smolensk air crash, including Lech Kaczyński, the President of Poland at the time. At the 2010 Polish presidential election, Donald Tusk decided not to stand. At PO primary elections, Bronisław Komorowski defeated the Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, at the second round of voting on 4 July 2010, he defeated PiS&#x27;s Jarosław Kaczyński. and on 6 August 2010 he was sworn in as president. At the November 2010 local elections, PO won 31 percent of the votes and PiS 23 percent, an increase for the former and a drop for the latter compared to the 2006 elections.

In October 2011, Donald Tusk became the first ever Polish Prime Minister to be re-elected in post-communist Poland. PO won a record of four consecutive elections. PO&#x27;s dominance was seen as a reflection of right-wing divisions, with PiS splitting in autumn 2010.

==Duda Presidency (2015–present)==
After two rounds of elections in May 2015, opposition Law and Justice (PiS) candidate Andrzej Duda became president by a 3% margin. In October 2015, the PiS won the simple majority in the Sejm, was able to form the first single-party government since the fall of communism in 1989.

Since the PiS control the presidency and have the majority in both houses, it aims to make judiciary reforms in the Constitutional Court. (See Polish Constitutional Court crisis, 2015)

In the context of rising tensions with the EU, the Polish government is being accused of leading Poland towards democratic backsliding. Media outlets fully controlled by capital from outside the EU are now facing the risk to sell parts of their Polish channels, as is already common in other EU countries (like Germany or France). As there are no legal objections, critics and the primarily concerned US mass media outlet (Discovery, Inc.) raise that this would be an attack on the expression of free speech. The newly appointed US ambassador Mark Brzezinski stated that he is concerned by this and plans to support freedom of speech.

In December 2017, Mateusz Morawiecki was sworn in as the new prime minister, succeeding Beata Szydlo, in office since 2015. They both represented the ruling Law and Justice party, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski.

Poland&#x27;s governing Law and Justice party (PiS) won the parliamentary election in October 2019.

Duda was re-elected in the 2020 presidential election.

Poland has been one of neighbouring Ukraine&#x27;s most ardent supporters after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of November 2022, Poland had received more than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees since the beginning of the war. In September 2023, however, Poland said that it will stop supplying arms to Ukraine and instead focus on its own defense. Poland&#x27;s decision to ban importing Ukrainian grain, in order to protect its own farmers, had caused tension between the two countries.

In October 2023, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party won the largest share of the vote in the election, but lost its majority in parliament. In December 2023, Donald Tusk became the new prime minister to succeed Morawiecki, leading a coalition of three parliamentary groups made up of Civic Coalition, Third Way, and The Left. Law and Justice became the leading opposition party.
===Second Donald Tusk government (2023–present)===
The United Right alliance placed first for the third straight election and won a plurality of seats but fell short of a Sejm majority. The opposition, consisting of the Civic Coalition, Third Way, and The Left, achieved a combined total vote of 54%, managing to form a majority coalition government. On 10 November, Civic Coalition, Poland 2050, Polish People&#x27;s Party and New Left signed a coalition agreement with Tusk as their candidate for prime minister. The opposition parties wanted to sign the agreement before the Sejm&#x27;s first sitting in order to show that they stood ready to govern. Morawiecki was required to secure the Sejm&#x27;s confidence within two weeks of being sworn in. Under the Constitution, if Morawiecki failed to do so, the Sejm would then designate its own candidate for prime minister, and Duda would be required to appoint that candidate before 11 December. Most commentators expected Morawiecki to come up short of the support needed to govern, as no other party willing to go into coalition with PiS would give it enough support to command the confidence of the Sejm.
On 27 November, Mateusz Morawiecki was sworn in by President Duda for an unprecedented third term as prime minister. His cabinet had been mockingly dubbed the &quot;Two Weeks Government&quot; by Polish media due to its low likelihood of passing the confidence vote.
On 11 December, Morawiecki&#x27;s caretaker cabinet lost a vote of confidence in the Sejm by 190 votes to 266. Later that day, the Sejm nominated Tusk for prime minister, who was subsequently confirmed by 248 votes in favour and 201 against. Tusk&#x27;s cabinet was sworn in on 13 December.

The new government enjoyed quite strong public support (which was expected during the first few months after the election), while the popularity of the minor parties giving it support, significantly waned. The October 15 Coalition, included plans to reform state media in their coalition agreement. On December 19, 2023, the Sejm passed a resolution on &quot;restoring the legal order and the impartiality and integrity of the public media and the Polish Press Agency&quot; with 244 votes in favor. There were 84 votes against and 16 abstentions. More than 100 Law and Justice deputies did not participate in the vote, having instead gone to the TVP headquarters to protest the change.

On the same day, Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz dismissed the authorities of public media, including TVP. Newly appointed TVP supervisory board would then designate Tomasz Sygut to be TVP&#x27;s new CEO.

The uneasy alliance between the three coalition partners came to difficult points when it comes to abortion, civil unions (which in the end became a govt bill) or health insurance contribution.

<text>WD-40 (Water Displacement, 40th formula) is an American brand and the trademark of a penetrating oil manufactured by the WD-40 Company based in San Diego, California. Its formula was invented for the Rocket Chemical Company in 1953, before it became the WD-40 Company. WD-40 became available as a commercial product in 1961. It acts as a lubricant, rust preventive, penetrant and moisture displacer. There are specialized products that perform better than WD-40 in many of these uses, but WD-40&#x27;s flexibility has given it fame as a jack of all trades.

It is a successful product to this day, with steady growth in net income from $27 million in 2008 to $70.2 million in 2021. In 2014, it was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

== History ==
Sources credit different people with inventing WD-40 formula in 1953 as part of the Rocket Chemical Company (later renamed to the WD-40 Company), in San Diego, California; the formula was kept as a trade secret and was never patented.

According to Iris Engstrand, a historian of San Diego and California history at the University of San Diego, Iver Norman Lawson invented the formula, while the WD-40 company website and other books and newspapers credit Norman B. Larsen. According to Engstrand, &quot;(Iver Norman) Lawson was acknowledged at the time, but his name later became confused with company president Norman B. Larsen.&quot; &quot;WD-40&quot; is abbreviated from the term &quot;Water Displacement, 40th formula&quot;, suggesting it was the result of the 40th attempt to create the product. The spray, composed of various hydrocarbons, was originally designed to be used by Convair to protect the outer skin of the Atlas missile from rust and corrosion. This outer skin also functioned as the outer wall of the missile&#x27;s delicate balloon tanks. WD-40 was later found to have many household uses and was made available to consumers in San Diego in 1958.

In Engstrand&#x27;s account, it was Iver Norman Lawson who came up with the water-displacing mixture after working at home and turned it over to the Rocket Chemical Company for the sum of $500 (). It was Norman Larsen, president of the company, who had the idea of packaging it in aerosol cans and marketed it in this way.

It was written up as a new consumer product in 1961. By 1965 it was being used by airlines including Delta and United; United, for example, was using it on fixed and movable joints of their DC-8 and Boeing 720s in maintenance and overhaul. At that time, airlines were using a variant called WD-60 to clean turbines, removing light rust from control lines, and when handling or storing metal parts. By 1969 WD-40 was being marketed to farmers and mechanics in England. In 1973, WD-40 Company, Inc., went public with its first stock offering. Its NASDAQ stock symbol is ().

==Formulation==
WD-40&#x27;s formula is a trade secret. The original copy of the formula was moved to a secure bank vault in San Diego in 2018. To avoid disclosing its composition, the product was not patented in 1953, and the window of opportunity for patenting it has long since closed.

WD-40&#x27;s main ingredients as supplied in aerosol cans, according to the US material safety data sheet information, and with the CAS numbers interpreted:
* 45–50% low vapor pressure aliphatic hydrocarbon (isoparaffin)
* &lt;35% petroleum base oil (non-hazardous heavy paraffins)
* &lt;25% aliphatic hydrocarbons (same CAS number as the first item, but flammable)
* 2–3% carbon dioxide (propellant)

The European formulation is stated according to the REACH regulations:
* 60–80% hydrocarbons C – C n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cyclics &lt;2% aromatics
* 1–5% carbon dioxide

The Australian formulation is stated:
* 50–60% naphtha (petroleum), hydrotreated heavy
* &lt;25% petroleum base oils
* &lt;10% naphtha (petroleum), hydrodesulfurized heavy (contains: 1,2,4-trimethyl benzene, 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene, xylene, mixed isomers)
* 2–4% carbon dioxide

In 2009, &quot;Wired&quot; published an article with the results of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry tests on WD-40, showing that the principal components were C to C alkanes and mineral oil.

<doc id="354187" wikidata="Q685173" url="?curid=354187" title="Eagle Claw">
<text>Eagle Claw (; pinyin: yīng zhǎo pài; &quot;eagle claw school&quot;) is a style of Chinese martial arts known for its gripping techniques, system of joint locks, takedowns, and pressure point strikes, which is representative of Chinese grappling known as Chin Na. The style is normally attributed to the famous patriotic Song dynasty General Yue Fei. Popular legends states that he learned martial arts from a Wudang Monk named Zhou Tong and later created Eagle Claw to help his armies combat the invading armies of the Jin dynasty. It was passed down until the Ming dynasty. Thus, the style took on long range strikes and aerial jumps. During the Qing dynasty, the military instructor Liu Shi Jun became known as the modern progenitor of Eagle Claw and taught many students. His student Liu Cheng You later taught Chen Zizheng who was invited to teach the style in the prestigious Chin Woo Athletic Association during the Republican era. The style spread as Chin Woo opened sister schools in other provinces. Today, it is practiced around the world.

==History==
While the details of the history alter according to the teller, with names and places shifting as they tend to do in any oral history, in essence the story of Eagle Claw began in the Shaolin Temple and in Chinese military training, became a family tradition passed on from parent to child for generations and eventually shed its air of secrecy with the advent of public martial arts schools.

===Yue Fei===
The creation of the Eagle Claw method is normally attributed to General Yue Fei (1103–1141) who lived at a time of conflict between the Southern Song dynasty and the Jurchen tribes of the Jin dynasty. Despite being literate, young Yue Fei chose the military path because there had never been any tradition of full-fledged Confucian civil service in his family history. However, the Yue family was much too poor to afford military lessons for their son, so the boy&#x27;s maternal grandfather Yao Dewang hired Chen Guang (陈广) to teach the eleven-year-old how to wield the Chinese spear. Then a local knight errant named Zhou Tong (周同) was brought in to continue Yue&#x27;s military training in archery after he had quickly mastered the spear by the age of thirteen.

None of Yue Fei&#x27;s biographies mention him learning boxing as a child, but martial researcher Stanley Henning states &quot;[Yue] almost certainly did practice some form of bare handed fighting as a basic foundation for use of weapons.&quot; However, he doesn&#x27;t venture to guess if either of his teachers or someone else taught him boxing. Despite this, many modern day martial arts masters have assigned Zhou Tong this position. For instance, the internalist Yang Jwingming claims Zhou was a scholar who trained at the famed Shaolin temple and later taught Yue other skills beyond archery, such as various forms of internal and external martial arts. Yang believes this later led to Yue&#x27;s creation of Eagle Claw and &quot;xingyi&quot;, another style associated with the general. The history that Yang presents does not mention the spearplayer Chen Guang and erroneously casts Zhou as Yue&#x27;s only teacher. Eagle Claw proponent Leung Shum does this as well and goes so far as to claim Zhou was a full-fledged Shaolin monk who trained Yue Fei inside of the temple itself. Leung believes Zhou taught him &quot;Elephant Style&quot; which the general later expanded to create the &quot;&#x27;108 Locking Hands Techniques&#x27; or Ying Sao (Eagle Hand).&quot; There is no evidence that Zhou was ever associated with the Shaolin Temple, though.

The general&#x27;s biographies are also silent about him creating any styles of his own. The historian Meir Shahar notes Yue&#x27;s mention in the second preface of the &quot;Sinew-Changing Classic&quot; (1624) is what &quot;spurred a wave of allusions to the patriotic hero in later military literature&quot;. He continues, &quot;By the eighteenth century, Yue Fei had been credited with the inventions of &quot;xingyiquan&quot;, and by the nineteenth century the &#x27;Eight Section Brocade&#x27; and weapon techniques were attributed to him as well.&quot; The &quot;Ten Compilations on Cultivating Perfection&quot; (Xiuzhen shi-shu) (c. 1300) assigns the creation of the Eight Section Brocade to two of the Eight Immortals, namely Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin.

====Shape-Mimicking Fist====
In Chinese, &quot;xiang&quot; () means &quot;shape, form, or appearance&quot;. &quot;Xiang Xing Quan&quot; (象形拳), literally means &quot;Imitation Boxing&quot; or &quot;Shape-Mimicking Fist&quot;. It is a fighting technique which emphasizes the imitation of the offensive and defensive actions of a certain animal characteristic or celestial personage. In the relevance of the &quot;Ying Zhao Fan Tzi&quot; system the &quot;Xiang&quot; refers to moving or movement within the walking fist routine Xiang Quan Shi Lu

&quot;Xiang Xing Quan&quot; is an umbrella term for any martial arts that mimics characteristic/ forms/ movement/ action from anything other than human, and there are more than one school of kungfu practicing imitation boxing. Example of the animal style: Dragon, Tiger, Panther, Snake, Crane style (that falls under Hung Gar) Eagle Style Chin Na, horse, Mantis Boxing and so on.

===Shaolin===

According to legend, in the late Ming dynasty Yue Fei&#x27;s material is said to have made a re-appearance at one of the sister schools of the Shaolin temple. Lai Chin/Liquan Seng (麗泉僧), an expert in the Bashanfan boxing method, encountered soldiers practicing the hand techniques that was called Yue Shi San Shou (岳家拳). After taking the time to learn and master these skills he undertook the daunting task of assimilating them into his pre-existing Fanziquan sets. Some earlier exponents nicknamed it &quot;Ying Quan/Eagle Fist&quot; due to the numerous grabbing skills present.

===Qing dynasty===

In 1644 the Ming dynasty was overthrown and replaced by the Qing dynasty. The earliest mention of a traceable lineage of Eagle Claw comes from the Liu Family of Hebei Province.

===Liu Shi Jun and Liu Cheng You===

Liu Shi Jun (劉士俊劉仕俊(1827？-1910) (fl. 19th century) of Xiong County, Baoding City, Hebei is considered the Sijo (founder/ancestor) of the &quot;yīng zhǎo fān zi quán&quot; (鷹爪翻子拳). He took up martial arts at an early age and studied under several exponents of Shaolin kungfu, Fanzi, and possibly Chuojiao and Liuhe boxing which were around at the time. Around middle age, he learned &quot;Yue Shi San Shou&quot;and Fanzi from Fa Cheng - Fa Seng (法成僧) and Dao Ji Seng (道濟僧). He later was appointed as the military arts instructor for one of the barracks in the capital city of Beijing. He taught the troops fist and spear skills. His students were Liu Cheng You (劉成有), Liu Dekuan (劉德寬), Ji Zixiu (纪子修), Xu Liu, Ji De, Li Zhengsheng and others.

Liu Cheng You (劉成有) first learned martial arts from his uncle Liu Dekuan (劉德寬), who had been a student of Liu Shi Jun when stationed in Beijing. He continued his instruction under other prominent martial artist of the region such as &quot;Dong Xianzhou (Ba Shan Fan) and Yang Jingshan nicknamed &quot;flying Legs&quot;. He later received advanced training under Liu Shi Jun when he retired to his home village. Liu Chen You turned out to be a very strict teacher and only accepted a few students. The main 2 were Liu Qi Wen (劉啟文) &amp; Chen Zizheng (陳子正). From them the system expanded and became popular when associated with the famous Chin Woo Association. Many of their students became prolific teachers that helped spread the system throughout Asia were: Zhang Zhan Wen (张詹文) Liu Zhi Xiang, Liu Zhan Wu, Lei Peixian, Bao Xi Yong, Chen Go Qing, Guo Cheng Yao, Li Bao Ying, Liu Shu Yan 劉書彦, Liu Fa Meng, Zhang Jung Ting, etc.

===Chin Woo Athletic Association===

The Chin Woo Athletic Association was fronted by the famed martial artist Huo Yuanjia in Shanghai. Its purpose was the dissemination of not only Martial Arts but sports and other educational systems to the public. The Eagle Claw system remained relatively restricted to the Xiong County, Baoding City in Hebei until Chen Zizheng was invited to teach at the Chin Wu.

After initial success with the first School in Shanghai, Chen went to his training brother Liu Qi Wen to offer his students careers as Martial Arts instructors in the Chin Woo Association. In time, Eagle Claw was being taught in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guandong, Futsan, Singapore, Malaysia etc.

== Lineages ==

There are 3 main Eagle Claw lineages known that most teachers/schools can trace their style to.

#Liu Qiwen (劉啟文) (Lau Kai Man)
#Chen Zizheng (陳子正) (Chan Tzi Ching)
#Zhang Zhan Wen (张詹文) (Chian Jin Man)

==Training==

How the Eagle Claw system is taught varies between each teacher&#x27;s skill and experiences. What is consistent of an Eagle Claw Master is their knowledge of the 3 core Hand sets of the style and the Spear.

*Xíng Quán (行拳) is known as the &quot;Walking Fist.&quot; This set consists of ten to twelve rows of techniques representative of what is today known as Shaolin Fanziquan.
*Lián Quán (連拳) is known as the &quot;Linking Fist.&quot; A very important set consisting of 50 short lines/rows repetitive techniques on both the left side and right side, in that it not only provides the exponent with an encyclopedic base of the various seizing, grappling and joint-locks of qinna, but it also incorporates various Qigong skills as well. Based on Older Fanzi Routines that were combined and restructured by the Eagle Claw King Chen Zi Zheng. Most have nicknamed this set the &quot;Dictionary of Eagle Claw&quot; due to the content containing probably 90% of the style&#x27;s skills and techniques taught within 50 Rows.
*Yuè Shì Sàn Shǒu (岳氏散手; &quot;Yue Clan Free Hand&quot;) (aka Yī Bǎi Ling Bā Qín Ná 一百零八擒拿 – &quot;108 Seizing Grabbing&quot; techniques) is considered the &quot;heart&quot; of the Eagle Claw system. It is believed to be the original material passed down by the style&#x27;s legendary founder Yue Fei. This material has 108 different categories of skills/techniques that are trained to a level of perfection with partners. One thing to remember is that each sequence is only an example of that category which contains numerous variations and offshoots.

Qiang/Cheung (枪) -Spear is the primary Weapon associated with the Eagle Claw Style. There is no consensus as to what the original spear routine was as numerous diverse sets exist in the different branches. It is felt that there were mainly loose skills that one would practice singularly then against an opponent. Legend tells us that Yue Fei&#x27;s was called Lì Quán Qiāng (沥泉枪; &quot;Trickling Fountain Spear&quot;) which is still taught as part of the Yuèjiā (岳家) System preserved by Zhang Lan Yei, 26th generation inheritor of Yue Family Fist.

<doc id="354193" wikidata="Q1543343" url="?curid=354193" title="Graphical Kernel System">
<text>The Graphical Kernel System (GKS) was the first ISO standard for low-level computer graphics, introduced in 1977. A draft international standard was circulated for review in September 1983.
Final ratification of the standard was achieved in 1985.

==Overview==
GKS provides a set of drawing features for two-dimensional vector graphics suitable for charting and similar duties. The calls are designed to be portable across different programming languages, graphics devices and hardware, so that applications written to use GKS will be readily portable to many platforms and devices.

GKS was fairly common on computer workstations in the 1980s and early 1990s.
GKS formed the basis of Digital Research&#x27;s GSX which evolved into VDI, one of the core components of GEM. GEM was the native GUI on the Atari ST and was occasionally seen on PCs, particularly in conjunction with Ventura Publisher. GKS was little used commercially outside these markets, but remains in use in some scientific visualization packages. It is also the underlying API defining the Computer Graphics Metafile. A descendant of GKS was PHIGS. One popular application based on an implementation of GKS is the GR Framework, a C library for high-performance scientific visualization that has become a common plotting backend among Julia users.

A main developer and promoter of the GKS was José Luis Encarnação, formerly director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics (IGD) in Darmstadt, Germany.

GKS has been standardized in the following documents:
* ANSI standard ANSI X3.124 of 1985.
* ISO 7942:1985 standard, revised as ISO 7942:1985/Amd 1:1991 and ISO/IEC 7942-1:1994, as well as ISO/IEC 7942-2:1997, ISO/IEC 7942-3:1999 and ISO/IEC 7942-4:1998
* The language bindings are ISO standard ISO 8651.
* GKS-3D (Graphical Kernel System for Three Dimensions) functional definition is ISO standard ISO 8805, and the corresponding C bindings are ISO/IEC 8806.

The functionality of GKS is wrapped up as a data model standard in the STEP standard, section ISO 10303-46.

<doc id="354195" wikidata="Q4943064" url="?curid=354195" title="Book of Mulling">
<text>The Book of Mulling or less commonly, Book of Moling (Dublin, Trinity College Library MS 60 (A. I. 15)), is an Irish pocket Gospel Book from the late 8th or early 9th century. The text collection includes the four Gospels, a liturgical service which includes the &quot;Apostles&#x27; Creed&quot;, and in the colophon, a supposed plan of St. Moling&#x27;s monastery enclosed by two concentric circles.

The name derives from a former notion that the scribe was the Leinster saint St. Moling (d. 697), founder of Tech-Moling (St. Mullins, Co. Carlow), whose subscription occurs in the colophon at the end of St John&#x27;s Gospel: &quot;[N]omen scriptoris Mulling dicitur&quot;. However, the manuscript is younger and the script reveals that three scribes were involved: one for the prefaces, another for the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) and a third for St John&#x27;s Gospel. It remains possible that the manuscript was copied from an autograph manuscript of St Moling.

The script is written in Irish minuscule. This is in fact one of the latest surviving documents to use the high style in illuminated manuscripts. The decoration includes illuminated initials and three surviving Evangelist portraits: those of Matthew, Mark and John. Its jewelled shrine or cumdach is also preserved at Trinity College. The pocket gospel book is a distinctively Insular format, of which the Book of Mulling is a leading example.

==The Portrait of John==

The Evangelist John is shown in a fully frontal pose. He holds a book or tablet of some kind, with his hand over it and his heart. This could be a reference to his position as the scribe of one of the Gospels. He has blond hair and blue eyes, and his robes are in shades of rich blue and red. The robes flow around him, forming interlaced, almost geometric shapes, echoing those around the border. There is a border surrounding the portrait. In this case, John&#x27;s halo, a marker of his holy status, breaks the frame created by the border. The border is relatively sparse above and below the Evangelist, however on the left and the right elaborate designs have been created within the border.

Interlaced line-work fills squares in all four corners, two panels on the left and the right feature interlocking animal shapes, elongated and interlaced to the point of being nearly unrecognizable. Both of these patterns call to mind the style of metalwork also popular in this period. The colors are faded, but the richness of this image is evident by the use of gold and the immense attention to detail, making this one of the leading examples of illuminated manuscript art from this period.

==Early Irish Manuscript Project==
Trinity College, Dublin has recently launched a major initiative, called the Early Irish Manuscripts Project, to conserve, research, and digitize the manuscripts in their collection. These manuscripts include the Book of Mulling, Book of Dimma, Garland of Howth, and Codex Usserianus Primus. This project has encouraged new research on these manuscripts, as well as greater access to them, as they are available online. The goal of the Early Irish Manuscript Project is to encourage and facilitate new research on the manuscripts in the collection of Trinity College Dublin. Non-destructive pigment analysis was used in the research.

<text>Marty Kristian (born Martins Vanags on 27 May 1947) is a German-born, British-based musician. He grew up, and started his musical career, in Australia, as a solo artist. He is a singer-song writer-guitarist and, in the 1970s, he became a heartthrob as a founding member of the New Seekers (1969–74, 1976–2002).

== Biography ==

Martins Vanags was born in Leipzig, Germany in 1947 to Latvian-born parents, Paul and Rute &quot;Ruth&quot; Vanags. His father died before he turned one-year-old and he migrated to Australia with his mother in 1950. He attended Northcote High School for secondary education and then started a course in architecture at Melbourne University. He left after 2 years when his widowed mother became ill and worked as a trainee draughtsman to support her.

Kristian played with local bands in his spare time – his breakthrough came when he appeared on TV pop music series, &quot;The Go!! Show&quot;. His debut single, &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Ask to Be Brought Here&quot;, a cover version of Bobby Darin&#x27;s 1965 hit, was issued in 1966. In August he performed Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot; on &quot;The Go!! Show&quot;.

Kristian supported a local tour by the English pop singer Crispian St. Peters. In March 1967 he released his second single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Give You Love&quot;, written and produced by St. Peters. He explained to Beverley Cooper of &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; why he had to leave his day job, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t getting enough sleep. Sometimes I would be out singing until two a.m. Then I had to get up and be in my office at nine in the morning. It was too much.&quot; Aside from singing, he contributed to his performance style by designing his own clothing, &quot;I like clothes that bring out the personality of the wearer... I don&#x27;t go for bright colors. I think the real modern look depends on cut rather than color.&quot; Cooper described his favourite look as a &quot;military style jacket with bell-bottom trousers.&quot;

In Australia he issued two further solo singles, &quot;It Comes and Goes&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Inn-Keeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1968), before taking a singing gig on a cruise ship and relocating to the UK. In late 1969 Kristian, on lead guitar, backing vocals and occasional lead vocals, became one of the founders of the New Seekers, which were a pop rock group assembled in London by Keith Potger (ex-the Seekers) and David Joseph, a talent manager. The group&#x27;s fellow founders were Chris Barrington on bass guitar and backing vocals, Eve Graham on lead vocals, Sally Graham (no relation) on lead vocals, and Laurie Heath on guitar and backing vocals. Potger, initially a member as singer and producer for the group, left to become their manager by the end of 1970.

As a band member Kristian wrote or co-wrote tracks for the New Seekers, including &quot;Hello Again&quot;, &quot;One More Sunny Day&quot; (both 1969), &quot;Idaho&quot;, &quot;Reap What You Sow&quot;, &quot;Mystic Queen&quot; (all three, 1972), &quot;Country Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Hey Look High&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Your Number&quot;. The group broke up in May 1974.

Kristian, Eve Graham and Layton reconvened the New Seekers in 1976 with Kathy Ann Rae and Danny Finn joining. According to Steve Huey of AllMusic, &quot;Kristian and Layton continued to lead various New Seekers lineups into the &#x27;80s and sporadically during the &#x27;90s, but despite continued world tours, they were strictly a nostalgia act.&quot; He left the group in February 2002 and was replaced by Mark Hankins.

=== Personal life ===

His son James Kristian has acted in television programmes, including the BBC Television series, &quot;Doctors&quot;. He played the part of Allen Rissbrook in &quot;As If&quot;. He is married to Carol whom he met in 1970 during a Summer Season in Great Yarmouth. They married 5 years later in 1975 and are still happily married. They have another son Oliver who became a creative in advertising.

<doc id="354197" wikidata="Q366819" url="?curid=354197" title="Simon Phillips (drummer)">
<text>Simon Phillips (born 6 February 1957) is an English jazz fusion and rock drummer, songwriter, and record producer, based in the United States. He worked with rock bands during the 1970s and 1980s, and was the drummer for the band Toto from 1992 to 2014.

Phillips worked as a session drummer for Phil Manzanera&#x27;s 801, Jeff Beck, Big Country, Gary Moore, Michael Schenker, Bernie Marsden, Jon Lord, Nik Kershaw, Mike Oldfield, Judas Priest, Mike Rutherford, Tears for Fears, 10cc, the Chemical Brothers, Pete Townshend, and the Who. He was the drummer for the Who during the band&#x27;s American reunion tour in 1989. He became the drummer for Toto in 1992 after the death of Jeff Porcaro.

==Career==
Phillips began to play professionally at the age of twelve in a Dixieland band led by his father, Sid Phillips, for four years. After his father&#x27;s death, he started playing pop and rock and found work in a production of the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. He worked as a session musician for cast members, and this led to other session work. Beginning in the 1970s, he worked with Jeff Beck, Gil Evans, Stanley Clarke, Peter Gabriel, Pete Townshend, and Frank Zappa.

Phillips was the drummer in the Phil Manzanera and Brian Eno supergroup 801 on their 1976 album &quot;801 Live&quot;. He replaced Judas Priest drummer Alan Moore to record on the band&#x27;s &quot;Sin After Sin&quot; album (1977), and on that album, Phillips introduced the combination of the double bass drumming that would come to define heavy metal in later years, particularly the thrash metal sub-genre which emerged in the 1980s. The track &quot;Dissident Aggressor&quot; was an early example of the tempo and aggression which would soon become synonymous with the new wave of British heavy metal. Author Andrew L. Cope has described &quot;Sin After Sin&quot; as a key album in the development of heavy metal technique, in particular for its use of double kick drumming. That same year, Phillips played on &quot;Evita&quot;. Around 1978, British guitarist Gary Boyle made an album called &quot;The Dancer&quot; featuring Simon Phillips.

Phillips played on Michael Schenker&#x27;s 1980 debut album &quot;The Michael Schenker Group&quot;, as well as in Mike Rutherford&#x27;s &quot;Smallcreep&#x27;s Day&quot;. In the early 1980s, Phillips formed part of RMS with session musicians Mo Foster and Ray Russell.

Phillips played and co-wrote songs on Jeff Beck&#x27;s 1980 jazz-rock fusion album &quot;There &amp; Back&quot;, featuring his double-kick prowess on the song &quot;Space Boogie&quot; which he also co-wrote. Another track, &quot;The Pump&quot;, was co-written by Phillips and appeared on the soundtrack to the 1983 film &quot;Risky Business&quot;.

In 1981, Phillips formed Ph.D. with Jim Diamond and Tony Hymas. The new wave outfit released two albums and five singles, including &quot;Little Suzi&#x27;s on the Up&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot;, before splitting up in 1983.

Phillips was the drummer for the Who on their 1989 American reunion tour and appeared on solo recordings by band members Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend.

Also in 1989, he recorded his debut album &quot;Protocol&quot;, for which he played all instruments. Wanting to make bigger changes in his music career, Phillips decided to move to Los Angeles in 1990. In 2000 he recorded a jazz album, &quot;Vantage Point&quot;, with trumpeter Walt Fowler, saxophonist Brandon Fields, and pianist Jeff Babko. Phillips also made an uncredited contribution on electronic duo the Chemical Brothers&#x27; 1997 break-out hit &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot;, drumming on the song &quot;Elektrobank&quot;.

===Toto===
In 1992, Phillips had recently completed the recording of an album in England when he was invited by Toto to fill in for Jeff Porcaro after the latter died following the completion of the recording of &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot;. Phillips became the band&#x27;s only choice to replace Jeff for two reasons: Jeff himself viewed Simon as one of his most favorite drummers (the others being Gregg Bissonnette and Vinnie Colaiuta), and that he toured with Steve Lukather and Carlos Santana on their solo tours. Phillips decided to settle permanently in Los Angeles and began rehearsals with the band. After the &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; tour, Phillips officially joined Toto.

As the band began its 1995 Tambu tour, Phillips suffered from back problems and was unable to play on the first leg of the said tour; the band turned to Gregg Bissonette to substitute for him. When Phillips fell ill prior to the 2004 Night of the Proms concert, Bissonette was unavailable to take over his drumming duties, causing the band to invite Ricky Lawson instead.

Phillips&#x27; last show with Toto was in 2013. He left the following year to focus on his solo career and was replaced by Keith Carlock.
===Hiromi Trio Project===
After leaving Toto, Phillips became a member of Hiromi Uehara&#x27;s Trio Project along with bassist Anthony Jackson. The Trio Project made four albums together: &quot;Voice&quot; (2011), &quot;Move&quot; (2012), &quot;Alive&quot; (2014), and &quot;Spark&quot; (2016). The albums &quot;Move&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot; reached the top 10 on the Billboard Jazz Album charts, with &quot;Spark&quot; hitting the number one position. From 2011-2016, Phillips toured extensively with the Hiromi Trio Project.

=== Other ventures ===
In 1997 Phillips appeared as a bandleader, performing at the North Sea Jazz Festival. He has co-produced and engineered albums by Mike Oldfield, Derek Sherinian, and Toto. Phillips has also worked with Big Country, Jack Bruce, David Gilmour, Big Jim Sullivan, and Whitesnake.

In 2009, Phillips joined with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and bassist Pino Palladino in forming an instrumental jazz/funk rock trio: Phillips Saisse Palladino, PSP, which toured in Europe in 2009 and 2010. Phillips also performed on Joe Satriani&#x27;s album &quot;Super Colossal&quot;, appearing on multiple tracks. Phillips appears in Alan Parsons&#x27; &quot;Art &amp; Science of Sound Recording&quot; educational video series, as well as the program&#x27;s single &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot;. He played in the Michael Schenker Group album &quot;In the Midst of Beauty&quot; and took part to the band&#x27;s 30th Anniversary world tour in 2010.

In 2018 Phillips was featured on the album &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. In addition to playing drums and keyboards, he engineered, mixed, and helped produce.

==Influences==
Phillips cited Buddy Rich, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham, Steve Gadd, Ian Paice, Tommy Aldridge, and Bernard Purdie as his main influences.

==Awards and honours==

* In 2003 Phillips was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine Hall of Fame.
*In 2015 at the 14th Annual Independent Music Awards, Phillips was the winner in the Jazz Instrumental Album category for &quot;Protocol II&quot;.

<text>Theodotus of Byzantium ( &quot;Theodotos&quot;; also known as Theodotus the Tanner, Theodotus the Shoemaker, Theodotus the Cobbler, and Theodotus the Fuller; flourished late 2nd century) was an Adoptionist theologian from Byzantium, one of several named Theodotus whose writings were condemned as heresy in the early church.

Theodotus held the profession of a leatherworker or fuller in Byzantium. He taught that Jesus was a non-divine man and, though later &quot;adopted&quot; by God upon baptism (that is to say, he became the Christ), was not himself God until after his resurrection.

This doctrine, sometimes called &quot;Dynamic Monarchianism&quot; or &quot;Adoptionism&quot;, was declared heretical by Pope Victor I, and Theodotus was excommunicated.

<doc id="354214" wikidata="Q449797" url="?curid=354214" title="Donald Hamilton">
<text>Donald Bengtsson Hamilton (March 24, 1916 – November 20, 2006) was an American writer of novels, short stories, and non-fiction about the outdoors. His novels consist mostly of paperback originals, principally spy fiction, but also crime fiction and westerns, such as &quot;The Big Country&quot;. He is known best for his long-running Matt Helm series (1960-1993), which chronicles the adventures of an undercover counter-agent/assassin working for a secret American government agency. The noted critic Anthony Boucher wrote: &quot;Donald Hamilton has brought to the spy novel the authentic hard realism of Dashiell Hammett; and his stories are as compelling, and probably as close to the sordid truth of espionage, as any now being told.&quot;

==Life==
Hamilton was born on March 24, 1916, in Uppsala, Sweden, to Dr. Bengt Leopold Knutsson Hamilton and Elise Franzisca Hamilton (née Neovius). On September 27, 1924, he boarded the S/S &quot;Stockholm&quot; with his mother and three sisters at the Port of Gothenburg, Sweden; the ship arrived at the Port of New York on October 6, 1924. The family&#x27;s destination was Boston, Massachusetts, where they joined his father, Doctor Hamilton. 

Donald attended the University of Chicago (receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in 1938), and served in the United States Navy Reserve during World War II as a chemist with the rank of Lieutenant. 

A long-time resident of Santa Fe, New Mexico, Hamilton was a skilled outdoorsman and hunter who wrote non-fiction articles for outdoor magazines and published a book-length collection of them. For a number of years after leaving Santa Fe he lived on his own yacht, then relocated to Sweden, where he lived until his death in 2006. A number of his Matt Helm novels are situated in the Santa Fe area and American Southwest in general; as Hamilton developed an interest in boating, many of the books began to have a nautical component as well.

Hamilton began his writing career in 1946, submitting pieces to fiction magazines like &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. His first novel, &quot;Date With Darkness&quot;, was published in 1947; during the next 46 years he published a total of 38 novels. His first three books were published in hardcover by Rinehart. After World War II, American publishers began to experiment with issuing original paperback fiction. Most of his early novels — published between 1954 and 1960 — were typical paperback originals of the era: fast-paced tales in paperbacks with lurid covers, whether suspense, spy, or western. The most interesting of them is, arguably, &quot;&quot;, (alternate title: &quot;Assassins Have Starry Eyes&quot;), in which a mathematician working on the design for a nuclear bomb has to save his kidnapped wife from a group of shadowy villains. Two classic western movies, &quot;The Big Country&quot; and &quot;The Violent Men&quot;, were adapted from his western novels (&quot;The Big Country&quot; and &quot;Smoky Valley&quot; respectively.)

More substantial was the Matt Helm series, published by Gold Medal company, which began with &quot;Death of a Citizen&quot; in 1960 and comprised 27 books, ending in 1993 with &quot;The Damagers&quot;. Helm, a wartime agent for a secret agency that specialized in assassinating Nazis, is drawn back, after 15 years as a civilian, into a post-war world of espionage and assassination. He narrates his adventures in a brisk, matter-of-fact tone with occasional humor. He describes gunfights, knife fights, torture, and (off-stage) sexual conquests with a carefully maintained professional detachment, like a pathologist dictating an autopsy report or a police officer describing an investigation. During the course of the series, this detachment comes to define Helm&#x27;s character. He is a professional doing a job; the job is killing people. Hamilton completed one more Matt Helm novel, &quot;The Dominators&quot; in 2002, that has not been published.

The noted &quot;Golden Age&quot; mystery writer John Dickson Carr began reviewing books for &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; in 1969, and often praised thrillers of the time. According to Carr&#x27;s biographer, &quot;Carr found Donald Hamilton&#x27;s Matt Helm to be &#x27;my favorite secret agent,&#x27;&quot; although Hamilton&#x27;s books had little in common with Carr&#x27;s. &quot;The explanation may lie in Carr&#x27;s comment that in espionage novels he preferred Matt Helm&#x27;s Cloud cuckoo land. Carr never valued realism in fiction.&quot;

Hamilton died while sleeping on November 20, 2006. His papers are housed at the Charles E. Young Research Library at the University of California, Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
He was married to Kathleen Hamilton (née Stick) from 1941 until her death in 1989. The couple had four children: Hugo, Elise, Gordon, and Victoria Hamilton.

&quot;Five Steps to Danger&quot;, 1957; adaptation of &quot;The Steel Mirror&quot;.

&quot;The Big Country&quot;, 1958; adaptation of &quot;&quot;The Big Country&quot; (Hamilton novel)&quot;.

General audiences may be more familiar with Matt Helm through a series of popular action-comedy movies produced during the late 1960s featuring Dean Martin in the title role. These farcical movies are based only slightly upon Hamilton&#x27;s writings, which are much more realistic and grim. 

* &quot;The Silencers&quot;, 1966
* &quot;Murderers&#x27; Row (novel)&quot;, 1966
* &quot;The Ambushers&quot;, 1967
* &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;, 1969

DreamWorks optioned the movie rights to Hamilton&#x27;s books in 2002 and began planning a more serious adaptation of the Matt Helm novels, but the project is currently in abeyance.
