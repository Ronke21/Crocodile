<text>The Kane County Cougars are a professional baseball team located in Geneva, Illinois, and are members of the American Association of Professional Baseball, an official Partner League of Major League Baseball (MLB). They play their home games at Northwestern Medicine Field. From 1991 to 2020, they were members of Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Midwest League.

==History==
The Midwest League came to Kane County in 1991 when the Wausau Timbers relocated to Geneva, IL. The Wausau (1975–1990) Midwest League franchise was previously based in Decatur, Illinois (1952–1974). The team has been known as the Cougars since moving to Kane County. They were affiliated with the Baltimore Orioles in 1991 and 1992, with the Florida Marlins from 1993 to 2002, the Oakland Athletics from 2003 until 2010, the Kansas City Royals for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, and the Chicago Cubs for the 2013 and 2014 seasons before affiliating with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2015.

As a Marlins farm team, some key contributors to the 2003 World Series championship team played in Kane County on their way to the big leagues. Miguel Cabrera has had a notable career and 2003 Series MVP Josh Beckett played for the Cougars in 2000, while Dontrelle Willis had the league&#x27;s best winning percentage and earned run average in 2002.

The Cougars play their home games at Northwestern Medicine Field, built in 1991. The franchise attendance record of 523,222 was set in 2001. The Cougars are perennially among the league leaders in attendance. On July 20, 2013, the Cougars became the first Class A team to attract 10 million fans. Nancy Faust, after 40 years with the Chicago White Sox, was the stadium organist for selected Cougar home games until her retirement after the 2015 season.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cougars&#x27; season was cancelled along with the rest of Minor League Baseball. Later that year, the team was cut from the Midwest League and affiliated baseball as part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues. The team considered becoming a member of the MLB Draft League before joining the American Association, an independent MLB Partner League.

The team has led the American Association in attendance since joining in 2021, and led all MLB Partner Leagues in 2022. Following their 2024 American Association championship, the team was invited to participate in the 2025 Baseball Champions League Americas tournament.

<doc id="350362" wikidata="Q320638" url="?curid=350362" title="Solar and Heliospheric Observatory">
<text>The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) is a European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft built by a European industrial consortium led by Matra Marconi Space (now Airbus Defence and Space) that was launched on a Lockheed Martin Atlas IIAS launch vehicle on 2 December 1995, to study the Sun. It has also discovered more than 5,000 comets. It began normal operations in May 1996. It is a joint project between the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. SOHO was part of the
International Solar Terrestrial Physics Program (ISTP). Originally planned as a two-year mission, SOHO continues to operate after 29 years in space; the mission has been extended until the end of 2025, subject to review and confirmation by ESA&#x27;s Science Programme Committee.

In addition to its scientific mission, it is a main source of near-real-time solar data for space weather prediction. Along with Aditya-L1, Wind, Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), and Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), SOHO is one of five spacecraft in the vicinity of the Earth–Sun L1 point, a point of gravitational balance located approximately 0.99 astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun and 0.01 AU from the Earth. In addition to its scientific contributions, SOHO is distinguished by being the first three-axis-stabilized spacecraft to use its reaction wheels as a kind of virtual gyroscope; the technique was adopted after an on-board emergency in 1998 that nearly resulted in the loss of the spacecraft.

== Scientific objectives ==
The three main scientific objectives of SOHO are:
* Investigation of the outer layer of the Sun, which consists of the chromosphere, transition region, and the corona. The instruments CDS, EIT, LASCO, SUMER, SWAN, and UVCS are used for this solar atmosphere remote sensing.
* Making observations of solar wind and associated phenomena in the vicinity of . CELIAS and COSTEP are used for &quot;in situ&quot; solar wind observations.
* Probing the interior structure of the Sun. GOLF, MDI, and VIRGO are used for helioseismology.

== Orbit ==
The SOHO spacecraft is in a halo orbit around the Sun–Earth L1 point, the point between the Earth and the Sun where the balance of the (larger) Sun&#x27;s gravity and the (smaller) Earth&#x27;s gravity is equal to the centripetal force needed for an object to have the same orbital period in its orbit around the Sun as the Earth, with the result that the object will stay in that relative position.

Although sometimes described as being at L1, the SOHO spacecraft is not exactly at L1 as this would make communication difficult due to radio interference generated by the Sun, and because this would not be a stable orbit. Rather it lies in the (constantly moving) plane, which passes through L1 and is perpendicular to the line connecting the Sun and the Earth. It stays in this plane, tracing out an elliptical halo orbit centered about L1. It orbits L1 once every six months, while L1 itself orbits the Sun every 12 months as it is coupled with the motion of the Earth. This keeps SOHO in a good position for communication with Earth at all times.

== Communication with Earth ==
In normal operation, the spacecraft transmits a continuous 200 kbit/s data stream of photographs and other measurements via the NASA Deep Space Network of ground stations. SOHO&#x27;s data about solar activity are used to predict coronal mass ejection (CME) arrival times at Earth, so electrical grids and satellites can be protected from their damaging effects. CMEs directed toward the earth may produce geomagnetic storms, which in turn produce geomagnetically induced currents, in the most extreme cases creating black-outs, etc.

In 2003, ESA reported the failure of the antenna Y-axis stepper motor, necessary for pointing the high-gain antenna and allowing the downlink of high-rate data. At the time, it was thought that the antenna anomaly might cause two- to three-week data-blackouts every three months. However, ESA and NASA engineers managed to use SOHO&#x27;s low-gain antennas together with the larger and NASA Deep Space Network ground stations and judicious use of SOHO&#x27;s Solid State Recorder (SSR) to prevent total data loss, with only a slightly reduced data flow every three months.

== Near loss of SOHO ==
The SOHO Mission Interruption sequence of events began on 24 June 1998, while the SOHO Team was conducting a series of spacecraft gyroscope calibrations and maneuvers. Operations proceeded until 23:16 UTC when SOHO lost lock on the Sun and entered an emergency attitude control mode called Emergency Sun Reacquisition (ESR). The SOHO Team attempted to recover the observatory, but SOHO entered the emergency mode again on 25 June 1998, at 02:35 UTC. Recovery efforts continued, but SOHO entered the emergency mode for the last time at 04:38 UTC. All contact with SOHO was lost at 04:43 UTC, and the mission interruption had begun. SOHO was spinning, losing electrical power, and no longer pointing at the Sun.

Expert European Space Agency (ESA) personnel were immediately dispatched from Europe to the United States to direct operations. Days passed without contact from SOHO. On 23 July 1998, the Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone Solar System Radar combined to locate SOHO with radar and to determine its location and attitude. SOHO was close to its predicted position, oriented with its side versus the usual front Optical Surface Reflector panel pointing toward the Sun, and was rotating at one revolution every 53 seconds. Once SOHO was located, plans for contacting SOHO were formed. On 3 August, a carrier was detected from SOHO, the first signal since 25 June 1998. After days of charging the battery, a successful attempt was made to modulate the carrier and downlink telemetry on 8 August. After instrument temperatures were downlinked on 9 August 1998, data analysis was performed, and planning for the SOHO recovery began in earnest.

The Recovery Team began by allocating the limited electrical power. After this, SOHO&#x27;s anomalous orientation in space was determined. Thawing the frozen hydrazine fuel tank using SOHO&#x27;s thermal control heaters began on 12 August 1998. Thawing pipes and the thrusters was next, and SOHO was re-oriented towards the Sun on 16 September 1998. After nearly a week of spacecraft bus recovery activities and an orbital correction maneuver, the SOHO spacecraft bus returned to normal mode on 25 September 1998 at 19:52 UTC. Recovery of the instruments began on 5 October 1998 with SUMER, and ended on 24 October 1998, with CELIAS.

Only one gyroscope remained operational after this recovery, and on 21 December 1998, that gyroscope failed. Attitude control was accomplished with manual thruster firings that consumed of fuel weekly, while the ESA developed a new gyroless operations mode that was successfully implemented on 1 February 1999.

== Instruments ==
The SOHO Payload Module (PLM) consists of twelve instruments, each capable of independent or coordinated observation of the Sun or parts of the Sun, and some spacecraft components. The instruments are:

* Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS ), which measures density, temperature and flows in the corona.
* Charge Element and Isotope Analysis System (CELIAS), which studies the ion composition of the solar wind.
* Comprehensive SupraThermal and Energetic Particle analyser collaboration (COSTEP ), which studies the ion and electron composition of the solar wind. COSTEP and ERNE are sometimes referred to together as the COSTEP-ERNE Particle Analyzer Collaboration (CEPAC ).
* Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), which studies the low coronal structure and activity.
* Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron experiment (ERNE ), which studies the ion and electron composition of the solar wind. (See note above in COSTEP entry.)
* Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies (GOLF), which measures velocity variations of the whole solar disk to explore the core of the Sun.
* Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), which studies the structure and evolution of the corona by creating an artificial solar eclipse.
* Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), which measures velocity and magnetic fields in the photosphere to learn about the convection zone which forms the outer layer of the interior of the Sun and about the magnetic fields which control the structure of the corona. The MDI was the biggest producer of data on &quot;SOHO&quot;. Two of SOHO&#x27;s virtual channels are named for MDI; VC2 (MDI-M) carries MDI magnetogram data, and VC3 (MDI-H) carries MDI Helioseismology data. MDI has not been used for scientific observation since 2011 when it was superseded by the Solar Dynamics Observatory&#x27;s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager.
* Solar Ultraviolet Measurement of Emitted Radiation (SUMER), which measures plasma flows, temperature, and density in the corona.
* Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN), which uses telescopes sensitive to a characteristic wavelength of hydrogen to measure the solar wind mass flux, map the density of the heliosphere, and observe the large-scale structure of the solar wind streams.
* UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS), which measures density and temperature in the corona.
* Variability of solar IRradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO), which measures oscillations and solar constant both of the whole solar disk and at low resolution, again exploring the core of the Sun.

=== Public availability of images ===
Observations from some of the instruments can be formatted as images, most of which are readily available on the internet for either public or research use (see the official website). Others, such as spectra and measurements of particles in the solar wind, do not lend themselves so readily to this. These images range in wavelength or frequency from optical (Hα) to Extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Images taken partly or exclusively with non-visible wavelengths are shown on the SOHO page and elsewhere in false color.

Unlike many space-based and ground telescopes, there is no time formally allocated by the SOHO program for observing proposals on individual instruments; interested parties can contact the instrument teams via e-mail and the SOHO website to request time via that instrument team&#x27;s internal processes (some of which are quite informal, provided that the ongoing reference observations are not disturbed). A formal process (the &quot;JOP&quot; program) does exist for using multiple SOHO instruments collaboratively on a single observation. JOP proposals are reviewed at the quarterly Science Working Team (SWT) meetings, and JOP time is allocated at monthly meetings of the Science Planning Working Group. First results were presented in &quot;Solar Physics&quot;, volumes 170 and 175 (1997), edited by B. Fleck and Z. Švestka.

=== Comet discoveries ===

As a consequence of its observing the Sun, SOHO (LASCO instrument) has inadvertently allowed the discovery of comets by blocking out the Sun&#x27;s glare. Approximately one-half of all known comets have been spotted by SOHO, discovered over the last 15 years by over 70 people representing 18 different countries searching through the publicly available SOHO/LASCO images online. SOHO had discovered over 2,700 comets by April 2014, with an average discovery rate of one every 2.59 days. 

=== Milestones ===

* SOHO-5000 (C/2024 ??) – 25 March 2024, Hanjie Tan

As of 13th December 2024, SOHO has found 5,124 comets.

=== Instrument contributors ===
The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research contributed to SUMER, Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), and CELIAS instruments. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) built the UVCS instrument. The Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL) built the MDI instrument in collaboration with the solar group at Stanford University. The Institut d&#x27;astrophysique spatiale is the principal investigator of GOLF and Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), with a strong contribution to SUMER. A complete list of all the instruments, with links to their home institutions, is available at the SOHO Website.

<text>Paul Anthony Tracy (born December 17, 1968) is a Canadian professional auto racing driver who participated in Champ Car World Series, the IndyCar Series, and the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART). He started kart racing at age five and quickly became successful and began car racing at sixteen, finishing third in the 1985 Formula Ford 1600 championship with one win and Rookie of the Year honors. Tracy became the youngest Canadian Formula Ford champion in the 1985 CASC Formula 1600 Challenge Series and was the youngest Can-Am race winner the following year. He raced in the American Racing Series for three years between 1988 and 1990, winning the series title with nine wins from fourteen races in 1990.

Tracy&#x27;s CART career began in the 1991 season with Dale Coyne Racing. However, following one race, he drove three races for Penske Racing. He competed with Penske in eleven races during the 1992 season, finishing on the podium three times. In the 1993 season, Tracy finished third in the drivers&#x27; standings after winning five races. The following year, Tracy won three more races. He moved to Newman/Haas Racing for the 1995 season, winning two races before returning to Penske for the 1996 championship. Tracy won another three races in the 1997 season before being fired for criticizing the car and joined Team Green the following year. He was third in the 1999 championship with two victories but fell to fifth in 2000 season despite three more wins. Tracy&#x27;s form declined over the next two seasons but won one race in 2002. He joined Forsythe Racing in the 2003 championship, winning his first (and only) series title with seven victories.

In the renamed Champ Car World Series (CCWS) in 2004 and 2005, he won two races for fourth overall in both seasons. Tracy&#x27;s performance declined during a 2006 season in which he took three podium finishes. His final Champ Car victory came in the 2007 championship. Following the unification of the CCWS and the IndyCar Series, he raced part-time for the KV Racing Technology, Vision Racing, A. J. Foyt Enterprises, Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing and Dragon Racing teams over the following three years. Tracy entered NASCAR-sanctioned stock car races in its Busch Series and the Camping World Truck Series, sports car racing through the Rolex Sports Car Series as well as the Stadium Super Trucks and the Superstar Racing Experience.

Nicknamed &quot;The Thrill from West Hill&quot; for his aggressive driving style and his bad boy image, his outspoken nature saw him placed on probation and fined several times by CART. He analysed IndyCar races for the Canadian broadcaster Sportsnet in the 2013 season and then for NBCSN between the 2014 and 2021 seasons. Tracy is an inductee of the Long Beach Motorsports Walk of Fame and the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Tracy was born in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada on December 17, 1968, and grew up in the working-class bedroom suburb east of Toronto. He is the son of Northern Ireland-born house painter Tony Tracy, who was the president of Trabur Painting, and his English wife Vivienne Tracy. Tony rode a Velocette in England and Ireland before injuring himself in an accident and emigrating to Canada with his two brothers in the 1960s. Tracy has two older half-sisters from his father&#x27;s first marriage and a younger sister. He attended Jack Miner Public High School and continued attending while karting, graduating after passing all of his subjects.

==Junior racing career==
Tracy got his first miniature motorized mini-bike when he was four, and received his first small motorized children&#x27;s go-kart from his father aged five. His father&#x27;s painting company provided enough funds for his son to compete in karts and, later, cars. He drove every weekend on tracks in Central and Eastern Canada as well as the Northern United States; Tracy had to prepare and maintain his kart because his father worked long hours. He was inspired by four-time Indianapolis 500 winner A. J. Foyt, and learnt go-karting from driver Scott Goodyear, before he progressed from the junior class to the senior category when he was 12 years old. Tracy won the Canadian Senior Karting Championship twice and 91 of 94 races in his first full senior season. He entered the North American Race of Champions and finished in the top ten of the Karting World Championship twice.

Tracy stopped racing karts upon turning 15, and his father had Goodyear teach him how to drive and handle race cars, as well as car setup. Aged 16, he progressed to car racing and his father wanted him to enter several European and North American events and race series as possible. Tracy finished third in the Formula Ford 1600 Championship with one victory, and was named Rookie of the Year. He raced in the 1985 CASC Formula 1600 Challenge Series with Colin Hines Racing in a small Van Diemen RF85-Ford formula open-wheel car. Tracy was Formula Ford&#x27;s youngest Canadian champion following a season-long battle with Scott Maxwell. He retired from the CASC Formula Ford 2000 Canadian Run-Off in a Van Diemen RF86 and won the CASC Formula Ford 1600 Canadian Run-Off from pole position at Circuit Mont-Tremblant. Tracy also failed to start the FAQ Challenge Labatt 50 Formula 1600 round at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.

In 1986, he moved to the higher-tier Formula 2000 and raced a Rothmans-entered Van Diemen RF86 single-seater open wheel car in the Canadian Formula 2000 Championship. Tracy was fourth overall, with one win at Sanair Super Speedway and three podium finishes for 164 points. He also raced four rounds of that year&#x27;s , winning the third Sanair round and did three races in the British Formula 2000 Championship with two podium finishes. Tracy raced a Porsche 944 for Mark Motors in the seven-round Porsche Challenge Series, finishing 17th overall with 40 points. He finished 12th in the Rothmans Porsche Canadian Run-Off and 5th in the Formula 2000 Canadian Run-Off in the Buick Grand National 1986 at Mont-Tremblant. Tracy accepted an offer from Canadian driver Horst Kroll to drive Kroll&#x27;s third Frissbee KR4-Chevrolet car at the final round of the 1986 Can-Am Series—the Budweiser 650 at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park—after impressing Kroll with his abilities at Sanair. He took his first (and only) Can-Am victory from pole position and became its youngest ever winner at age 17. Tracy finished fifth in the Ford Race of Champions at Brands Hatch in England.

He returned to the United Kingdom in late 1986 to race in the BBC Winter Grandstand Series for Formula Ford 2000 cars, finishing fourth overall, and worked for Van Diemen owner Ralph Firman Sr. Tracy won the season-opening Mosport Park round of the 1987 Canadian Formula 2000 Championship in a Trabur Painting-run Reynard 87SF the following year, finishing 15th overall with 59 points. He drove a Ralt RT4 car in three rounds of the HFC Formula Atlantic Challenge, finishing 30th in points with nine scored, and had an accident in the SCCA SPI International Formula Atlantic Championship round at Memphis International Raceway. Tracy also competed in four Porsche Challenge Series rounds, finishing third in Mosport and Montreal. He completed his Canadian racing season early in August 1987 since he had nothing to gain by finishing the season.

Tracy competed in the ten-round New Zealand International Formula Pacific championship in early 1988, finishing third with David Brabham, with two wins at Timaru International Motor Raceway, four podium finishes, and one pole in a Ralt RT4-Ford for Graeme Lawrence Autosport. He switched to the Hemelgarn Racing team and progressed to the higher-tier American Racing Series (ARS)—Championship Auto Racing Teams&#x27; (CART) developmental series— for the 1988 season with sponsorship funding acquired by his father. Driving the outdated, standard March 86A-Buick V6 Wildcat car raced by all ARS participants, Tracy won the season-opening round at Phoenix Raceway but unreliability and accidents affected the rest of his season with four more top-tens. He finished tenth in the final standings with 58 points and was voted ARS Rookie of the Year.

Tracy&#x27;s father formed the Maple Leaf Racing team for his son to race in the 1989 ARS season after Tracy was reportedly one of three drivers considered to drive for Footwork&#x27;s Japanese Formula 3000 squad. He finished in the top ten five times in eleven races, with best finishes of second place at Phoenix and Portland International Raceway due to his retirement from most races, and finished eighth in the drivers&#x27; championship with 65 points. Tracy also finished fifth in the 1989 Corvette Challenge round at Toronto with Jumbo Racing. In November 1989, he tested a Reynard Formula 3000 car for Eddie Jordan Racing at Silverstone Circuit to evaluate him as a full-time driver for the 1990 International Formula 3000 Championship but declined team owner Eddie Jordan&#x27;s offer of a race seat due to the trouble of attracting Canadian sponsors.

Tracy joined team owner Brian Stewart and his Landford Racing team for the 1990 ARS season, acquiring sponsorship but on the condition he would be withdrawn from a race if his father attended an event outside of Toronto and the final round at Laguna Seca. He and his crew spent two weeks in Arizona, testing and preparing his car for the races. Tracy dominated the season with consistency, winning nine of fourteen races and setting records for most pole positions in a season (seven) and consecutive victories (four). He also led the most laps, despite CART forcing drivers mid-season rule requiring drivers to be alongside each other during a race restart following a yellow flag caution period. Tracy finished the season with a season-record 214 points and secured the series title with three races remaining. He finished second in the Canadian Formula 2000 Championship race at Mosport Park in a Van Diemen 90RF car.

==American-open wheel racing career==
===1991–1997===

Steve Horne, Truesports manager-owner, gave Tracy a test session in a Lola-Judd car at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in September 1990 and was signed on the option of a three-month retainer testing contract for 1991 in October 1990 after lapping faster than regular driver Raul Boesel. Truesports offered him a three-year contract to partner Scott Pruett, but sponsor Budweiser refused since he was 21 and too young for them to promote him. Tracy rejected an offer to drive four races for the team. Tracy received no other CART offers, so his father rented a year-old 39 Lola T90/00-Chevrolet car from Dale Coyne Racing (DCR) owner Dale Coyne for the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach after he could not obtain sponsorship from Canadian companies and had to refinance the family home. Making his CART debut in the second round of the 1991 season, he qualified 14th but his engine overheated due to a broken water pipe, leaving him 22nd. Tracy did not race again with DCR that year.

Tracy&#x27;s work had impressed Penske Racing owner Roger Penske, who would surprise the family by calling them while they ate dinner in Scarborough and requesting they meet him in Detroit that same night. Tracy was offered a five-year testing contract with no guarantees of competitive driving and had to relocate to Pennsylvania, with Penske not accepting any negotiation or review. He would replace Danny Sullivan, testing and developing cars for CART champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Rick Mears, and began a training program to increase muscle and lose weight on Penske&#x27;s orders. Tracy completed a engine endurance test at Michigan International Speedway before proceeding to Mid-Ohio, where he outpaced regular driver Fittipaldi. After being pleased by Tracy&#x27;s performance and preparing him for driving on an superspeedway before the Indianapolis 500, Penske put Tracy in his third car in the Michigan 500 in August. Starting eighth in the year-old No. 17 Penske PC-19-Chevrolet, he lost control as he got too close to driver Scott Brayton and crashed, breaking the fibula and tibia in his lower left leg. Tracy was allowed to enter the season&#x27;s final two races at Nazareth Speedway and Laguna Seca after going on a therapy program on Fittipaldi&#x27;s advice, and he finished seventh in the former. He was third in the Rookie of the Year standings.

He raced eleven times for Penske in the 1992 season and tested the team&#x27;s new Chevrolet V8B engine for Fittipaldi and Mears. Tracy lost more weight in the off-season by hiring a trainer and starting a fitness program. He drove a year-old PC-19-Chevrolet vehicle before switching to the PC-20-Chevrolet car from Detroit. Tracy qualified sixth for the season&#x27;s second round, the Valvoline 200 in Phoenix, and finished fourth two laps down. Tracy debuted in the Indianapolis 500 that year, starting 19th and finishing 20th due to a gearbox failure. He filled in for the injured Mears at Detroit and again for the rest of the season starting from the Molson Indy Toronto. Tracy finished a season-high second in both Detroit and Mid-Ohio and took his first CART pole at Road America. He ended the season 12th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 59 points.

Tracy stayed with Penske for the 1993 championship and drove full-time after Mears retired, and was trained by the latter. He expected to be sacked after Penske tested McLaren&#x27;s Formula One (F1) driver Ayrton Senna at Phoenix, but continued racing for Penske. Tracy&#x27;s No. 12 Penske PC-22-Chevrolet retired from five of the first six rounds due to either mechanical failure or accidents. He started second at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, the season&#x27;s third race, and led 81 of 105 laps for his maiden CART victory. Tracy won consecutive races, the Grand Prix of Cleveland at Burke Lakefront Airport after leading 69 laps from pole position, and the Molson Indy Toronto a week later. He started the New England 200 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway fourth and led 130 laps before being passed by Nigel Mansell with four laps left for the win. Tracy won his final two races of the season by leading all 50 laps of the Texaco/Havoline 200 at Road America and 81 laps of the Toyota Grand Prix of Monterey at Laguna Seca. He was third in the drivers&#x27; standings with 157 points after a late-season duel with Bobby Rahal and Boesel.

Before the 1994 season, Tracy was assigned Dave Stevenson as his manager by Penske to relieve him of most personal and sponsorship functions. He raced in the new No. 3 PC-23 chassis, a rebuild of the previous year&#x27;s car powered by an improved Ilmor V8 engine. Tracy was unreliable in three of the first four races, and was involved in a multi-car crash in Phoenix after qualifying on pole there and in Long Beach. He finished in the top ten for the first time in 1994 in the Milwaukee Mile before winning the Detroit Grand Prix after colliding with teammate Al Unser Jr. on the 55th lap, which sent Unser into a tire wall. Tracy had five more top fives with podiums in Portland, Cleveland, Mid-Ohio and New Hampshire and took pole position in Elkhart Lake before an engine failure left him 18th. He ended 1994 with wins in the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix at Nazareth, when he led 192 of 200 laps, and the Bank of America 300 at Laguna Seca, where he started from pole position three weeks later. Tracy was third overall with 152 points.

Following Penske&#x27;s return to a two-car team, Tracy&#x27;s father discovered a provision prohibiting him from driving one-year old cars for either the small, underfunded Bettenhausen Motorsport or Hogan Racing squads and Tracy did not want to race for underachieving teams. He signed a three-year contract with team owners Carl Haas and Paul Newman in October 1994 to replace the retired Mario Andretti at Newman/Haas Racing, but Penske could resign him for the 1996 season if Fittipaldi left after the 1995 championship. Tracy drove the underpowered No. 3 Lola T95/00-Ford. In the season&#x27;s second round, the Australian Indy Car Grand Prix at Surfers Paradise, he won his first race of the season, passing teammate Michael Andretti with eight laps left. Tracy took the championship lead after finishing fourth at Phoenix, before winning the Miller Genuine Draft 200 at Milwaukee by holding off Unser in the final laps. The rest of the season yielded six top tens with three second places at Road America, Mid-Ohio and Laguna Seca. Tracy&#x27;s left ankle was injured in a karting accident, requiring him to deflate the clutch pedal with a specially built carbon fibre shield over his left racing boot. Tracy was sixth in the drivers&#x27; standings with 115 points.

His relationship with co-owner Haas worsened when he informed him that he would return to Penske on a four-year contract in 1996. Tracy took over for Fittipaldi, driving the new Penske PC-25 with an updated Mercedes-Benz engine. He underwent radial keratotomy to improve his vision, meaning he no longer required glasses. During practice for the Marlboro 500 at Michigan, Tracy broke the sixth vertebra, sustained a soft tissue injury and bruised his knees in a major accident. He was replaced by Jan Magnussen for the round at Mid-Ohio. Tracy finished the season with three pole positions (Homestead-Miami, Nazareth, and Milwaukee) in 14 races marred by accidents and a noncompetitive car that forced him to push its tyres beyond their capability, six top-ten finishes, including a third-place finish at Milwaukee, and on-track rivalries with Robby Gordon and Michael Andretti. He finished 13th in the drivers&#x27; championship with 60 points, his worst finish since the 1992 season.

Tracy remained at Penske for the 1997 season, driving the Penske PC-26-Mercedes-Ilmor car, which was aerodynamically inefficient and lacked grip, especially on road courses. Penske shifted his focus on letting Tracy use his testing abilities to develop the car that he did not switch to the more competitive Reynard. He started the season second at Homestead-Miami before colliding with Chip Ganassi Racing&#x27;s Alex Zanardi at Surfers Paradise and finishing eighth in Long Beach following collisions with Greg Moore and Paul Jasper, respectively. Tracy qualified on pole for the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix at Nazareth and led for 186 of the 225 laps to claim his first victory in 27 races. He won the following Rio 400 to move into the lead of the points standings and the Motorola 300 at Gateway International Raceway for a third successive victory two weeks later. Tracy qualified on pole in Milwaukee, missed the race in Detroit due to a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, which made him dizzy and clouded his vision, and had four top-ten finishes that were followed by crashes in four of the final five rounds. He was fifth in the final points standings with 121.

Tracy&#x27;s criticism of the car&#x27;s performance grew louder, especially after what he viewed as an embarrassing finish at his home race in Toronto. His now public lobbying for the team to move away from the in-house chassis, Ilmor engine, and Goodyear tires were viewed by Penske as detrimental to the team&#x27;s sponsors and suppliers, prompting the team to release him from his contract two years early before the 1998 season.

===1998–2003===

After Forsythe Racing owner Gerald Forsythe committed to drivers Patrick Carpentier and Moore, he signed a one-year contract to drive the No. 26 Reynard 98I-Honda for Barry Green&#x27;s two-car Team Green operation with finance from Brown &amp; Williamson cigarette company in less than a week. In the 19 races he entered that season, Tracy was involved in several accidents and achieved seven top-tens with a best finish of fifth in three races (Motegi, Nazareth and Mid-Ohio) for 13th overall with 61 points. He and team owner Green were involved in a pit lane alteration at Houston following Tracy&#x27;s rear-end collision with teammate Dario Franchitti. Tracy was suspended from the first race of the following season because of Michael Andretti crashing into the back of his car when Tracy blocked him at Surfers Paradise and ten other incidents of car contact involving Tracy that year.

He stayed with Team Green for the 1999 season, having signed a contract extension through the 2001 season as a result of the attention for his sponsor following his alteration in Houston. Tracy was assigned the retired Tony Cicale as an engineering consultant to work with and make the driver calmer by moderating his expectations of attempting to win every race, and the two had a cordial relationship. His one-race suspension saw him replaced in the No. 26 Reynard 99I-Honda car by Indy Racing League (IRL) driver Boesel for the season-opening round at Homestead–Miami. Tracy achieved one podium finish at Nazareth in the season&#x27;s first six races. Following the Gateway round, in which he and Franchitti collided, Green told them that whomever was ahead in the remaining races would win, and the other driver was ordered not to attempt an overtake and risk a race-ending crash. Tracy&#x27;s first victory of the season came at the Miller Lite 225 in Milwaukee, when Jimmy Vasser made a late race pit stop and Tracy saved fuel in the final five laps. He took four more podiums and won his second (and final) race of the season at the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston after leading 85 laps. Tracy finished third in the championship standings with 161 points.

He drove Team Green&#x27;s Reynard 2KI-Honda car for the 2000 season. Tracy started the season third at Homestead-Miami and won the following Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach to take the lead in the points standings. He held the championship lead for the next five races until he was disqualified from the Detroit round for running over refueller Jeff Simon&#x27;s foot and fracturing four of his toes during a pit stop, and then retired from the Portland race after crashing. Tracy had two top-ten finishes and qualified on pole at Michigan amid three more retirements in the next five races. He won successive races in the Motorola 220 at Road America and the following Molson Indy Vancouver after teammate Franchitti stalled during a pit stop to return to championship contention. Tracy finished fourth in Houston and crashed twice more in Gateway and Surfers Paradise in the following four races. Going into the season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway, he was one of six drivers mathematically eligible to win the championship; however, Tracy&#x27;s engine failed after 23 of 200 laps, leaving him fifth in the final drivers&#x27; standings with 134 points.

Tracy stayed with Team Green for the 2001 season and drove a Reynard 01I-Honda; in August 2000, he accepted the option of signing a four-year contract extension with the team through the 2005 season after rejecting a three-year contract offer from Team Forsythe to replace Carpentier when Green was willing to match Forsythe&#x27;s offer. Tracy looked forward to sharing information with new technical partner Michael Andretti, but he was separated in pit lane owing to his slow qualifying pace, which made sharing information difficult. He finished no worse than fourth in the first three races and was tied for the championship lead with Cristiano da Matta following the Nazareth event. The rest of Tracy&#x27;s season saw him finish in the top ten four more times, despite an unreliable car, accidents with other drivers, and pit lane blunders that dropped him down the points standings. He finished 14th in the championship standings with 73 points, his first winless season since 1998.

Tracy went on a weight loss/fitness program before the 2002 season and lost for improved performance. He drove the Reynard 02I-Honda for the first two rounds before Green switched to the more compact Lola B02/00 chassis for the remaining races when Reynard entered receivership. Tracy discovered that the Lola car handled better, but it may oversteer slightly while entering corners. He had two top-ten finishes in the season&#x27;s first three races. He took the lead at the start of the Miller Lite 250 in Milwaukee and led 184 of the 250 laps to claim his first (and only) win of the season. Tracy earned three more podium finishes and three other top-ten finishes in the final 14 races for 11th overall and 101 points.

In May, he made his IRL debut in the 2002 Indianapolis 500 driving Team Green&#x27;s No. 26 Dallara IR-02-Chevorlet entry after Green wanted to enter the event. Starting from 29th, he was running in second with one-and-a-half laps to go when he overtook Penske driver Hélio Castroneves just as the yellow caution flag light came on for a two-car accident between Buddy Lazier and Laurent Redon. IRL officials&#x27; rejected an appeal from Tracy&#x27;s team, and awarded the victory to Castroneves. Tracy has since maintained that he won the race.

When Team Green was renamed Andretti Green Racing and transferred to the rival IRL series for the 2003 season, he signed a two-year contract to drive for Forsythe Racing to remain in CART from the 2003 CART championship in August 2002 since he was guaranteed to race for the team in 2004. Tracy had negotiated with Newman/Haas Racing and Team Green before joining Forsythe. He took up cycling to lose weight and improve his fitness before the season began. Tracy won the season-opening Grand Prix of St. Petersburg after leading 71 of 105 laps. He led 69 of the 85 laps in the next Tecate/Telmex Grand Prix and won the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach to become the first Champ Car driver since Al Unser in 1971 to start the season with three consecutive victories. Despite qualifying on pole for the London Champ Car Trophy, three poor performances cost Tracy the championship lead at the Milwaukee Mile Centennial 250 to Bruno Junqueira. Tracy reclaimed the points lead with three straight podium finishes and pole position in Portland. He led the whole Molson Indy Toronto from pole position and a race-high 77 laps of the following Molson Indy Vancouver from another pole to become the first Canadian driver win two Canadian races in the same year. Tracy lost the championship lead to Junqueira again after crashing out in the Mario Andretti Grand Prix at Road America, which Junqueira won, but led 69 laps of the Champ Car Grand Prix of Mid-Ohio to win and reclaim the lead when Junqueira crashed. Following two top-ten finishes, he won the Gran Premio Telmex-Gigante from pole position after leading a race-high 64 laps. Tracy won his first CART championship and the Vanderbilt Cup by finishing 13th in the wet-weather Lexmark Indy 300, while Junqueira crashed with 10 laps remaining.

===2004–2012===
When CART went bankrupt and was renamed the Champ Car World Series (CCWS), he returned to drive Forsythe&#x27;s renumbered No. 1 car for his championship defence in 2004, declaring his wish to not drive IRL cars he characterized as &quot;crapwagons&quot;. Tracy was loyal to the CCWS, considering their cars better and found street circuits more of a challenge. He started third in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, the season&#x27;s first race, and won after leading 78 laps. He finished in the top ten in three of the next five races and took pole in Cleveland. Tracy traded verbal jabs with driver with driver Alex Tagliani, accusing him of impeding him for 12 laps in Portland and blaming him for causing a first-lap accident he was involved in Cleveland. His second victory of the season came at the Molson Indy Vancouver, where he led 81 of the 85 laps from pole position. The rest of the season saw a best finish of second at Denver, and four other top-tens for fourth in the drivers&#x27; standings with 254 points.

He returned to Forsythe for the 2005 season to drive the No. 3 car. Tracy started on pole position at the season-opening Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach and finished second. Two races later, in the Time Warner Cable Road Runner 225 at Milwaukee, he qualified fifth and led 192 of 225 laps to earn his fourth victory at the track. Tracy then won the Grand Prix of Cleveland from pole position, leading 46 of 91 laps and taking the championship lead from Sébastien Bourdais. He lost the points lead to Bourdais when his car ran out of fuel in the following Molson Indy Toronto after the two were involved in an unrelated collision at the pit lane exit. In the last seven races, he finished on the podium three times and took pole in Denver, where he led 59 laps before crashing. Tracy led a race-high 107 laps in the Hurricane Relief 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway before being hit in the rear by Bourdais, ending his race early. He placed fourth in the championship standings with 246 points.

Tracy stayed with Forsythe for the 2006 season. His best finish of the season were three second places in each of the rounds held in Houston, Toronto and Montréal and achieved six more top-ten finishes in the 13 races he entered in 2006. At the Grand Prix of San Jose, a collision between him and Tagliani caused by Tracy in third position reversing out of the turn six run-off area and into Tagliani&#x27;s path led to a physical altercation on pit road. Tracy&#x27;s sixth-place finish in the Grand Prix of Denver was overshadowed by another physical altercation, this time with Bourdais following a final-lap collision. Before the season-ending Gran Premio Telmex in Mexico City, he fractured his right shoulder blade in an ATV accident in Las Vegas and was replaced by Atlantic Championship driver David Martínez. Tracy was seventh in the drivers&#x27; standings with 209 points.

For the 2007 season, he drove the new Panoz DP01-Cosworth car with Forsythe, but the team had trouble setting it up, trying to make it drive like a Lola, and Tracy found it difficult to acquaint himself with the Panoz. In May 2006, emboldened by rumours of an IRL-CCWS merger, Tracy signed a five-year extension, preferring open-wheel cars after pondering full-time stock car racing. After placing third in the season-opener in Las Vegas, he crashed backwards at low speed into a concrete barrier during practice for the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, suffering a compression fracture to his first lumbar vertebrae and mild internal chest bleeding. Tracy was replaced by Servia for the next two races, and his preparation was limited before resuming competition in Portland. Tracy overcame separate crashes with Graham Rahal and Junqueira in the Grand Prix of Cleveland to win by leading the final 26 laps without stopping. The rest of the season yielded four top-ten finishes, including two fifth-place finishes for 11th in the championship rankings with 171 points.

Tracy had to renegotiate his contract with Forsythe for the 2008 season or be fired. He agreed to stay with Forsythe after speaking with IRL chief Tony George about joining the IRL since he feared his CCWS seat was at risk. Following the unification of CCWS and the IRL in February 2008, Forsythe concentrated on the lower-tier Atlantic Championship following the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach due to Gerald Forsythe&#x27;s animosity towards George, while Tracy sought George&#x27;s help in signing with a competitive IndyCar team. Tracy and Forsythe agreed for him to race in Long Beach despite a contract dispute over a stipulation that it field a car for him or let him race for another squad, finishing 11th. Following that, he made a one-time IRL entry at the Rexall Edmonton Indy driving Vision Racing&#x27;s third car, the No. 22 Dallara-Honda run by Walker Racing after he was unable to run IndyCar&#x27;s four road course races with the team. Tracy qualified 16th and finished fourth despite a pit-to-car radio issue. He made no more appearances with Vision Racing due to George&#x27;s sponsorship problems.

With the Great Recession hurting IndyCar, he entered six races in the 2009 season, five of which he drove KV Racing Technology&#x27;s No. 15 Dallara-Honda (the Indianapolis 500, Watkins Glen, Toronto, and Edmonton) and later No. 5 car (Mid-Ohio), after discussions with the team with assistance from industry friend Doug Barnett to get him sponsorship to race for the team. Tracy also drove A. J. Foyt Racing&#x27;s No. 14 car at Milwaukee in place of the injured Vítor Meira after talking to team director Larry Foyt but left the team following the race because it provided him with sub-par equipment. He finished in the top ten in three races, including a season-best sixth place in Edmonton.

Tracy continued to race part-time in IndyCar in the 2010 season. He entered three races (the Indianapolis 500, Toronto and Edmonton) with KV Racing Technology in its No. 15 car with sponsorship funding, and another three events (Watkins Glen, Kentucky and Motegi) for Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing as a substitute driver for the injured Mike Conway in its No. 24 entry. Tracy lost in eight weeks by cycling and embarked on a diet for two months after seeing footage of himself recording a television program to get more physically fit for the season. He did not qualify for the Indianapolis 500 because his car was slow and race strategist Barry Green deleted the time in vain, expecting Tracy to drive faster. Tracy&#x27;s best finish of the season was sixth place at Edmonton.

He signed a five-year sponsorship deal and was due to drive full-time with KV Racing Technology-Lotus in the 2011 championship, but sponsorship funding from driver Tony Kanaan shortly before the season began in St. Petersburg meant he was dropped from the team. Tracy instead accepted a five-race deal with Dragon Racing after being sought out by team owner Jay Penske when the team lost Kanaan due to sponsorship issues, and he also joined Dreyer &amp; Reinbold for the Indianapolis 500. He finished each of the six races held outside of the top ten places. Tracy was involved in a 15-car accident that killed Dan Wheldon at the season-ending IZOD IndyCar World Championship in Las Vegas.

He started talking to some racing teams since he wanted to drive full-time in IndyCar for the 2012 season, not part-time, otherwise he would not compete. Tracy was close to signing a contract to drive a Dallara DW12 car for Michael Shank Racing (MSR) but the team could not get enough financial backing to enter the season-opening Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, preventing him from participating in his final planned season. He chose to stop racing following Wheldon&#x27;s death.

==Other racing ventures==

Tracy tested the Benetton Formula team&#x27;s B194 F1 car at the Circuito do Estoril in September 1994, at the invitation of F1 commercial rights owner Bernie Ecclestone, who sought to bring a CART driver to F1 as other F1 drivers had transferred to the highly popular CART championship. He did well in the test but declined Benetton&#x27;s three-year testing contract because there was no guarantee of racing or adequate pay.

In 2005, Tracy made his Rolex Sports Car Series debut in the 24 Hours of Daytona with Kodak-Bell Motorsports. Sharing the No. 54 Doran JE4-Pontiac Daytona Prototype (DP) car with Forest Barber, Terry Borcheller, Christian Fittipaldi and Ralf Kelleners, their car started 15th and finished 49th overall after retiring with an oil leak. The following year, he returned to participate in the season-opening 24 Hours of Daytona for MSR in the No. 6 Riley MkXI-Lexus with Mike Borkowski, Paul Mears Jr., and Ken Wilden. They were classified 54th after overheating problems. Tracy and Borkowski finished third in the following Mexico City 400km and was sixth with Borkowski and Tommy Constantine in the Brumos Porsche 250. In 2007, Tracy shared MSR&#x27;s No. 6 Riley-Lexus with A. J. Allmendinger, Ian James and Henri Zogaib in the 24 Hours of Daytona. Their car had mechanical issues and finished 16th in class and 26th overall.

He began competing in NASCAR&#x27;s Busch Series in the No. 34 Chevrolet Monte Carlo for five races in the 2006 season with Frank Cicci Racing and Jim Kelly Racing that were not on the same weekend as any CCWS rounds. This was done in the hope he would compete full-time in either the Busch or Nextel Cup Series in 2007. Tracy exhibited an interest in NASCAR as early as 1999, and Barnett helped him secure finance. Funding was raised for Tracy to enter ten races but Forsythe wanted him to do five. He also drove Biagi Brothers Racing&#x27;s No. 34 Dodge Charger in the Telcel-Motorola 200 at Mexico City. Tracy had his season-best finish of 24th at the season-opening Hershey&#x27;s Kissables 300 at Daytona International Speedway, after starting 40th. He planned to race for Riley-D&#x27;Hondt Motorsports in six races of the 2007 Busch Series with the possibility of driving the Car of Tomorrow in the Nextel Cup Series but instead focused on his CCWS career.

Tracy drove one Craftsman Truck Series race in Germain Racing&#x27;s No. 9 Toyota Tundra late in the 2008 season (the Chevy Silverado 350K at Texas). He impressed team owner Bob Germain enough at Chicagoland Speedway in Todd Bodine&#x27;s truck to sign a one-race contract, and raced in Texas rather than Las Vegas as intended, due to a Texas-based sponsor&#x27;s intervention. Tracy started 22nd and finished 20th. In the 2012 Rolex Sports Car Series, Tracy drove four races for Doran Racing in its No. 77 Dallara DP01-Ford with Brian Frisselle, Burt Frisselle, Jim Lowe and Billy Johnson and two for Action Express Racing in its No. 5 Chevrolet Corvette DP alongside David Donohue. His best finish of the season was third place in the Montreal 200. Tracy partnered Jon Bennett, Colin Braun and Lowe in Doran&#x27;s No. 77 Dallara-Ford car in the 2013 24 Hours of Daytona, finishing 48th overall after he collided with Simon Pagenaud in the tenth hour.

Between 2013 and 2016, he raced five rounds of the Stadium Super Trucks short course off-road racing series in Toronto. Tracy finished in the top ten in four of the five races, with his best series performance of fourth in the second 2014 Toronto event. In 2016, he and co-driver Gary Moore won the B category of the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association&#x27;s Indy Legends Charity Pro–Am race at Indianapolis in a 1965 Ford Mustang GT350. He drove two rounds of the Trans-Am Series at Road Atlanta and Indianapolis in Coleman Motorsports&#x27;s No. 87 Chevrolet Camaro after being invited to enter a race during the 2018 season. Tracy finished seventh at Road Atlanta and 20th at Indianapolis. He contested the Bathurst 12 Hour for the first time in 2019 on the recommendation of NBC Sports commentator Leigh Diffey as a replacement for the injured Boris Said. Tracy shared the MARC Cars Australia&#x27;s No. 91 MARC Ford Mustang II with Keith Kassulke, Paul Morris and Anton de Pasquale in the Invitational category and retired after 189 laps with engine failure.

He replaced Eric Curran as William Hubbell&#x27;s co-driver in a Prestige Performance/Wayne Taylor Racing-entered Pro-Am category Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo North America round at Watkins Glen. Tracy finished 14th in the first race and 15th in the second. He returned to the Trans-Am Series in the TA2 category for the 2020 season, driving the No. 81 3-Dimensional Services Group Ford Mustang at the Circuit of the Americas round, replacing Doug Peterson. Tracy was disqualified from the race by the stewards for two illegal manoeuvres. He was invited to drive in the Mercedes-Benz category of the season-ending round of the SC Súper Copa at the Autódromo Miguel E. Abed in Pubela. Tracy was twelfth in the first race and ninth in the second.

In 2021, he began competing in the Superstar Racing Experience (SRX) short track racing series, and was involved in numerous accidents and altercations with other drivers. Tracy finished in the top ten in four out of six races with a best finish of fifth at both Eldora Speedway and Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway for seventh in the drivers&#x27; standings with 121 points. During the 2022 season, he took his first podium finish in SRX finishing third at Stafford Motor Speedway. Tracy was sixth in the final championship standings with 118 points. He was suspended from SRX competition on July 28, 2023, following a five-car accident he started in the 2023 season&#x27;s third round at Pulaski County Motorsports Park. Tracy did not return to SRX for the rest of the season.

He made his second appearance in the Bathurst 12 Hour in 2024 alongside Geoff Emery, Daniel Stutterd and Max Twigg in sharing TekworkX&#x27;s Invitational-category IRC GT car, finishing second in class despite damaging the car in wet conditions.

==Driving style==
Tracy has had an aggressive driving style from childhood, which he carried over into CART and was noted for his car control. By the 1999 season, he had learned to moderate his aggressiveness by learning when to make moves and so had fewer accidents. Sports car driver Ron Fellows observed that Tracy had learnt some of his technique in Europe and likened his karting style to Fittipaldi and Senna. He has a propensity for sliding a car into a turn with the rear-end out, which he has desired since he started kart racing. Tracy was known by fans for driving his car in places that most drivers did not consider, and he frequently crashed as a result. From 1994 until 2002, he employed a traction control device, an illegal electronic driver aid, to reduce tyre wear for greater drive-ability, but he was not allowed to reveal this knowledge for fear of repercussions from his team owner and engine manufacturer.

==Public image, other ventures and recognition==
Nicknamed the &quot;Thrill from West Hill&quot; after his 1993 Toronto CART victory for his aggressive driving style and his &quot;Bad Boy&quot; image, Tracy is outspoken, speaking his mind about issues. Bruce Martin, writing for NBC Sports, wrote that the driver &quot;became a crowd favorite because of his highly aggressive racing style and the fact he was intimidating on the racetrack&quot;, but his driving saw him put on probation as well as fined multiple times by CART. &quot;Toronto Life&quot; magazine characterised him as the &quot;strip club-attending rogue is the McEnroe of racing, perpetually battling the powers that be over some alleged infraction or other.&quot; CART and media outlets utilized his image to promote the series. Author Paul Ferris observed that some CART fans liked Tracy because he appeared to be &quot;a regular guy&quot; who had the &quot;lack of a classic athletic physique, and his penchant for displaying flashes of temper along with a well-timed jab at a driver who has wronged him.&quot;

Tracy had an supporting role on an episode of the 1980s television programme &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;, and was a guest on the November 7, 2003 episode of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. He appeared in 13 episodes of the 2010 Speed competition series &quot;Battle of the Supercars&quot;. Tracy analysed IndyCar races for Canadian broadcaster Sportsnet during the 2013 season, before joining NBCSN&#x27;s IndyCar Series broadcast team in the same role from the 2014 season. The producers permitted him to broadcast his racing opinions without using profanity or dumbing-down, and his presence was attributed in part to an increase in NBCSN ratings. Tracy was investigated by NBC Sports in late 2018 for allegedly posting a racist comment about immigrants on social media, but it cleared him after determining that he was not the author. He also worked as an NBCSN analyst at the 24 Hours of Daytona, before gradually reducing his broadcasting role owing to his SRX commitments and leaving the network after the 2021 season when his contract was not renewed.

In 1990, Tracy was awarded All-American status by the American Racing Writers&#x27; and Broadcasters Association &quot;for his performance in the support/development series for the PPG Indy Car World Series.&quot; He received the Bruce McLaren Trophy from the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club as &quot;the British Commonwealth&#x27;s most promising driver&quot; in 1990, and was named the Canadian Racing Drivers&#x27; Association Driver of the Year in 1991. Tracy was named to CART&#x27;s All-Star Team for both 1999 and 2000 and was voted the series&#x27; Most Improved Driver of 1999. He was voted CART&#x27;s Most Popular Driver of 2002 and 2003. He is an inductee of the Long Beach Motorsports Walk of Fame (2013), the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame (2014), and the Road to Indy Hall of Fame (2015). Tracy received an honorary diploma from Fanshawe College in November 2016. Paul Ferriss wrote a biography of him, &quot;Never Too Fast: The Paul Tracy Story&quot;, which was published in 2001.

He has done business with companies such as Goodyear, General Motors Canada, Molson, Snap-On Tools, No Fear, Yeti Cycles, and Spy Sunglasses. Tracy is the owner of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle parts and apparel firm Black Label Baggers. He was part of Team Green&#x27;s and African American mentoring organization 100 Black Men of America&#x27;s program to donate money to buy computers for youngsters in urban areas for better accessibility to technology based on his performance in five races in 2001. In 2007, Tracy joined a three-year campaign run by the Ontario Safety League against street racing in the Greater Toronto Area, and at the 2009 Edmonton Indy, raised awareness of the Wounded Warriors Canada non-profit charity that supports wounded Canadian troops overseas.

== Personal life ==
Tracy has been married three times: he married nursing student and high school sweetheart Tara Cormier on February 13, 1993, Liisa Hunter in mid-April 1998, and finally Patty Faraci in April 2005. He has two children from his first marriage. Tracy is a dual Canadian-American citizen. He maintains a collection of power boats, classic cars and motorcycles.

<text>The Peoria Chiefs are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. The team was established in 1983 as the Peoria Suns. They are located in Peoria, Illinois, and are named for the Peoria Indian tribe for which the city was named. In 2005, the team replaced the indigenous imagery associated with the Chiefs name and moved to a logo of a dalmatian depicted as a fire chief. The Chiefs play their home games at Dozer Park, which opened in 2002. They previously played at Vonachen Stadium near Bradley University from 1983 through 2001. The Chiefs have made the playoffs a total of 13 times, through eight wild-card berths, three first-half titles, and two second-half titles.

==History==
===Earlier professional baseball in Peoria===
The history of professional baseball in Peoria dates to the late 19th century. The Peoria Reds, Peoria Canaries, and Peoria Blackbirds played in several early leagues during parts of 1878 to 1895. The first ballpark used by these teams was reportedly called Sylvan Park and was located at the corner of Northeast Glendale Avenue and Spring Street on the location of the present-day St. Augustine Manor. In 1883, the club moved a few blocks toward Peoria Lake, to a facility called Lake View Park, on the southeast corner of Northeast Adams Street and Grant Street, which would remain the home of various Peoria clubs for the next four decades.

The 1895 club was dubbed the Peoria Distillers, referencing the Hiram Walker plant. From 1891 to 1911, Frank E. Murphy from Green Bay, Wisconsin, became involved with baseball, beginning with the purchase of the Peoria team of the Midwest League, which he later renamed the Peoria Hoosiers. That nickname would stick with the various Peoria clubs for the next couple of decades, including their first stretch with the Three-I League from 1905 to 1917. After the resumption of following the peak of American involvement in World War I, the Peoria Tractors name gained favor in 1919, with the growth of the nearby branch of the company later called Caterpillar Inc.

In 1923, the team opened a new ballpark called Woodruff Field in honor of a long-time mayor of Peoria. The new park was just across Grant Street from Lake View Park. The Tractors continued to play in several leagues before folding after the 1937 season. The city was then without professional baseball for the next 15 years. The name Peoria Chiefs first appeared with a new franchise in the Three-I League in 1953. This club disbanded after 1957, and Peoria was again without professional ball, for the next 25 years until the current Chiefs set up shop. The Woodruff Field site is now a softball facility called Woodruff Park.

===Current franchise===

The Peoria Suns were established in 1983. They played their home games at Meinen Field, built in 1968, near the Bradley University campus. The team&#x27;s name was changed to the Chiefs in 1984. The 1984 team was managed by future Major League Baseball manager Joe Maddon.

The 1988 team, managed by future major league manager Jim Tracy, was the subject of Joseph Bosco&#x27;s book &quot;The Boys Who Would Be Cubs&quot;.

Meinen Field was renovated before the 1992 season and renamed Vonachen Stadium in honor of Chiefs owner Pete Vonachen. The team moved to Dozer Park in downtown Peoria on May 24, 2002. During the new park&#x27;s first year, the team set a franchise attendance record of 254,407 and won the Midwest League championship.

Former Cubs catcher Jody Davis managed the 2006 team.

Baseball Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg was hired to manage the 2007 Chiefs, which went 71–68 and finished the second half 40–30 in a tie for the division title, but missed the playoff on a tiebreaker. The team set a new season attendance record of 259,794, an average of 3,800 per game. Sandberg returned to manage the Chiefs in 2008. The team set a Midwest League single-game attendance record on July 29, 2008, when the Chiefs drew a crowd of 32,103 to Wrigley Field in Chicago for a game against the Kane County Cougars.

The Chiefs&#x27; affiliation with the Cubs ended after the 2012 season, and they entered into a player-development contract with the St. Louis Cardinals.

Under Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Chiefs were organized into the High-A Central. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name used by the regional circuit before the 2021 reorganization.

===2008 brawl===
During a game on July 23, 2008, Dayton Dragons hit three Chiefs batters. The teams played again the following day, and in the first inning, Chiefs pitcher Julio Castillo hit Dragons batter Zack Cozart in the head. Two batters later, Castillo hit Angel Cabrera in the arm, and nearly hit another Dragon player in the head after that. Cabrera then spiked the Chiefs shortstop at second base on a slide. At that point, Chiefs fill-in manager Carmelo Martinez began arguing with the umpire. This brought out the Dragons manager, Donnie Scott, and the two argued for a few minutes before the umpires broke it up.

During the coaches&#x27; argument, pitcher Castillo fired a ball at the Dragons&#x27; dugout. The ball struck a fan, who was taken to the hospital. Brandon Menchaca proceeded to tackle Castillo from behind as both benches cleared, delaying the game for 69 minutes. After the game, Castillo was arrested for felonious assault. The injured fan, Chris McCarthy, suffered a concussion but recovered.

On August 8, 2009, Castillo was convicted of felonious assault causing serious physical injury and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. In April 2010, a judge released Castillo from probation &quot;on the condition that he leave the United States and not return for a minimum of three years.&quot;

<doc id="350375" wikidata="Q49015" url="?curid=350375" title="Spinning jenny">
<text>The spinning jenny is a multi-spindle spinning frame, and was one of the key developments in the industrialisation of textile manufacturing during the early Industrial Revolution. It was invented in 1764–1765 by James Hargreaves in Stan Hill, Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire in England.

The device reduced the amount of work needed to produce cloth, with a worker able to work eight or more spools at once. This grew to 120 as technology advanced. The yarn produced by the jenny was not very strong until Richard Arkwright invented the water-powered water frame. The spinning jenny helped to start the factory system of cotton manufacturing.

== History ==
The spinning jenny was invented by James Hargreaves. He was born in Oswaldtwistle, near Blackburn, around 1720. Blackburn was a town with a population of about 5,000, known for the production of &quot;Blackburn greys,&quot; cloths of linen warp and cotton weft initially imported from India. They were usually sent to London to be printed.

At the time, cotton yarn production could not keep up with demand of the textile industry, and Hargreaves spent some time considering how to improve the process. The flying shuttle (John Kay 1733) had increased yarn demand by the weavers by doubling their productivity, and now the spinning jenny could supply that demand by increasing the spinners&#x27; productivity even more. The machine produced coarse thread.

=== Components ===
The idea was developed by Hargreaves as a metal frame with eight wooden spindles at one end. A set of eight rovings was attached to a beam on that frame. The rovings when extended passed through two horizontal bars of wood that could be clasped together. These bars could be drawn along the top of the frame by the spinner&#x27;s left hand thus extending the thread. The spinner used his right hand to rapidly turn a wheel which caused all the spindles to revolve, and the thread to be spun. When the bars were returned, the thread wound onto the spindle. A pressing wire (faller) was used to guide the threads onto the right place on the spindle.

=== The politics of cotton ===
In the 17th century, England was famous for its woollen and worsted cloth. That industry was centred in the east and south in towns such as Norwich which jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701 only of cotton-wool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to . This was due to commercial legislation (Calico Acts) to protect the woollen industry. Cheap calico prints, imported by the East India Company from Hindustan (as India was then called), became popular. In 1700 an Act of Parliament was passed to prevent the importation of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused grey cloth (calico that had not been finished – dyed or printed) to be imported instead, and these were printed in southern England with popular patterns. Lancashire businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, which they sent to London to be finished. Cotton-wool imports recovered and by 1720 were almost back to 1701 levels. Again the woollen manufacturers claimed this was taking jobs from workers in Coventry. Another law was passed, to fine anyone caught wearing printed or stained calico; muslins, neckcloths and fustians were exempted. It was this exemption that the Lancashire manufacturers exploited.

The use of coloured cotton weft, with linen warp was permitted in the 1736 Manchester Act. There now was an artificial demand for woven cloth. In 1764, of cotton-wool was imported.

=== The economics of Northern England in 1750 ===
In England, before canals, railways, and before the turnpikes, the only way to transport goods such as calicos, broadcloth or cotton-wool was by packhorse. Strings of packhorses travelled along a network of bridle paths. A merchant would be away from home most of the year, carrying his takings in cash in his saddlebag. Later a series of chapmen would work for the merchant, taking wares to wholesalers and clients in other towns, and with them would go sample books.

Before 1720, the handloom weaver spent part of each day visiting neighbours buying any weft they had. Carding and spinning might be the only income for that household, or part of it. The family might farm a few acres and card, spin and weave wool and cotton. It took three carders to provide the roving for one spinner, and up to three spinners to provide the yarn for one weaver. The process was continuous, and done by both sexes, from the youngest to the oldest. The weaver would go once a week to the market with his wares and offer them for sale.

A change came about 1740 when fustian masters gave out raw cotton and warps to the weavers and returned to collect the finished cloth (Putting-out system). The weaver organised the carding, spinning and weaving to the master&#x27;s specification. The master then dyed or printed the grey cloth, and took it to shopkeepers. Ten years later this had changed and the fustian masters were middle men, who collected the grey cloth and took it to market in Manchester where it was sold to merchants who organised the finishing.

To hand weave a piece of eighteenpenny weft took 14 days and paid 36 shillings in all. Of this nine shillings was paid for spinning, and nine for carding. So by 1750, a rudimentary manufacturing system feeding into a marketing system emerged.

In 1738, John Kay started to improve the loom. He improved the reed, and invented the raceboard, the shuttleboxes and the picker which together allowed one weaver to double his output. This invention is commonly called the flying shuttle. It met with violent opposition and he fled from Lancashire to Leeds. Though the workers thought this was a threat to their jobs, it was adopted and the pressure was on to speed up carding and spinning.

The shortage of spinning capacity to feed the more efficient looms provided the motivation to develop more productive spinning techniques such as the spinning jenny, and triggered the start of the Industrial Revolution.

==Success==

Hargreaves kept the machine secret for some time, but produced a number for his own growing industry. The price of yarn fell, angering the large spinning community in Blackburn. Eventually they broke into his house and smashed his machines, forcing him to flee to Nottingham in 1768. This was a centre for the hosiery industry, and knitted silks, cottons and wool. There he set up shop producing jennies in secret for one Mr Shipley, with the assistance of a joiner named Thomas James. He and James set up a textile business in Mill Street. On 12 July 1770, he took out a patent (no. 962) on his invention, the Spinning Jenny—a machine for spinning, drawing and twisting cotton. 

By this time a number of spinners in Lancashire were using copies of the machine, and Hargreaves sent notice that he was taking legal action against them. The manufacturers met, and offered Hargreaves £3,000. He at first demanded £7,000, and stood out for £4,000, but the case eventually fell apart when it was learned he had sold several in the past.

The spinning jenny succeeded because it held more than one ball of yarn, making more yarn in a shorter time and reducing the overall cost. The spinning jenny would not have been such a success if the flying shuttle had not been invented and installed in textile factories. Its success was limited in that it required the rovings to be prepared on a wheel, and this was limited by the need to card by hand. It continued in common use in the cotton and fustian industry until about 1810. The spinning jenny was superseded by the spinning mule. The jenny was adapted for the process of slubbing, being the basis of the Slubbing Billy.

== Origin and myth ==
The most common story told about the invention of the device and the origin of the &quot;jenny&quot; in the machine&#x27;s name is that one of his daughters (or his wife) named Jenny knocked over one of their own spinning wheels. The device kept working normally, with the spindle now pointed upright. Hargreaves realised there was no particular reason the spindles had to be horizontal, as they always had been, and he could place them vertically in a row.

The name is variously said to derive from this tale. The Registers of Church Kirk show that Hargreaves had several daughters, but none named Jenny (neither was his wife). A more likely explanation of the name is that &quot;jenny&quot; was an abbreviation of &quot;engine&quot;.

Thomas Highs of Leigh has claimed to be the inventor and the story is repeated using his wife&#x27;s name.

Another myth has Thomas Earnshaw inventing a spinning device of a similar description – but destroying it after fearing he might be taking bread out of the mouths of the poor.

<doc id="350376" wikidata="Q362124" url="?curid=350376" title="Charles Doolittle Walcott">
<text>Charles Doolittle Walcott (March 31, 1850February 9, 1927) was an American paleontologist, administrator of the Smithsonian Institution from 1907 to 1927, and director of the United States Geological Survey. He is famous for his discovery in 1909 of well-preserved fossils, including some of the oldest soft-part imprints, in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada.

==Early life==
Charles Doolittle Walcott was born on March 31, 1850, in New York Mills, New York. His grandfather, Benjamin S. Walcott, moved from Rhode Island in 1822. His father, also Charles Doolittle Walcott, died when Charles Jr. was only two. Walcott was the youngest of four children. He was interested in nature from an early age, collecting minerals and bird eggs and, eventually, fossils. He attended various schools in the Utica area but left at the age of eighteen without completing high school, the end of his formal education. His interest in fossils solidified as he became a commercial fossil collector. 

On January 9, 1872, Walcott married Lura Ann Rust, daughter of the owner of a farm in New York where Walcott made one of his most important trilobite discoveries (Walcott-Rust quarry). She died on January 23, 1876. Walcott&#x27;s interest in fossils led to his acquaintance with Louis Agassiz of Harvard University, who encouraged him to work in the field of paleontology; later that year, he began work as the assistant to the state paleontologist, James Hall. He lost this job after two years but was soon recruited to the newly formed US Geological Survey as a geological assistant.

==Career==

Walcott began his professional paleontology career by discovering new localities, such as the Walcott-Rust quarry in upstate New York and the Georgia Plane trilobite beds in Vermont, and by selling specimens to Yale University. In 1876, he became the assistant to James Hall, State Geologist of New York. Walcott also became a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In 1879, Walcott joined the US Geological Survey and rose to become chief paleologist in 1893 and then director in 1894. His work focused on Cambrian strata in locations throughout the United States and Canada; his numerous field trips and fossil discoveries made important contributions to stratigraphy.

He married Helena Breese Stevens in 1888. They had four children between 1889 and 1896: Charles Doolittle Walcott, Sydney Stevens Walcott, Helena Breese Walcott, and Benjamin Stuart Walcott.

Walcott was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1896, the American Philosophical Society in 1897, and the American Academy of Art and Sciences in 1899. In 1901, he served both as president of the Geological Society of America and the Philosophical Society of Washington. In 1902, he met with Andrew Carnegie and became one of the founders and incorporators of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. He served in various administrative and research positions in that organization. In 1921 Walcott was awarded the inaugural Mary Clark Thompson Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.

He served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1923. He previously spearheaded the U.S. Geological Survey under President Theodore Roosevelt.

Walcott had an interest in the conservation movement and assisted its efforts.

==Smithsonian==
Walcott became Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1907 after the death of Samuel Pierpont Langley, holding the post until his own death. He was succeeded by Charles Greeley Abbot. Because of Walcott&#x27;s responsibilities at the Smithsonian, he resigned as director of the United States Geological Survey. As part of the centennial celebration of Darwin&#x27;s birth, Walcott was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cambridge in 1909.

In 1910, the year after his discovery of (middle Cambrian) fossils in the Burgess shale, Walcott returned to the area accompanied by his sons Stuart and Sidney. Together they examined all the layers on the ridge above the point where the fossil-laden rock had been found, eventually finding the fossiliferous band. Between 1910 and 1924, Walcott returned repeatedly to collect more than 65,000 specimens from what is now known as the Walcott Quarry, named after him. The find includes exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils, one of the oldest fossil beds containing soft-part imprints.

Walcott&#x27;s wife Helena died in a train crash in Connecticut in 1911. In 1914, Walcott married his third wife, Mary Morris Vaux, an amateur artist and avid naturalist. She accompanied him on his expeditions, enjoying the study of nature. She made watercolor illustrations of wildflowers as she traveled with him in Canada.

Although Walcott spent a considerable amount of time at the Burgess Shale quarry on what became known as Fossil Ridge, he also traveled widely in other areas of the Canadian Rockies. Some of his numerous scientific publications feature spectacular panoramic photographs of the mountains taken from high passes or high on mountain slopes.

==The NACA==
In 1914 Walcott convened a conference in Washington, D.C. for the purpose of stimulating interest in aeronautic science, and its relation to the U.S. government. The conference led to an act of congress organizing an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (later named the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) &quot;to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution.&quot; This committee was composed of twelve members, two each from the Army and Navy, one each representing the Smithsonian Institution, the Weather Bureau, and the National Bureau of Standards. Five additional members were chosen &quot;who shall be acquainted with the needs of aeronautical science, either civil or military, or skilled in aeronautical engineering or its allied sciences&quot;. Brigadier General George P. Scriven, Chief Signal Officer of the Army, was chairman of the committee; Walcott was elected chairman of the Executive Committee. William F. Durand was one of the civilian members of the Committee.

==Wright Brothers Controversy==
In light of the Wright brothers patent war and to discredit the Wright brothers, Glenn Curtiss in 1914 helped Walcott secretly make major modifications to a failed aerodrome built in 1903 by Professor Samuel Langley to make it appear able to fly. After the flight demonstrations, Walcott ordered the Langley machine be restored to its 1903 condition to cover up the deception before it was put on display. It took until 1928 for the Smithsonian Board of Regents to pass a resolution acknowledging that the Wright brothers deserved the credit for &quot;the first successful flight with a power-propelled heavier-than-air machine carrying a man.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
After Walcott&#x27;s death in Washington, D.C., his samples, photographs, and notes remained in storage until their rediscovery by a new generation of paleontologists in the late 1960s. Since then, many of his interpretations have been revised.

Walcott would be little known today if he had not been brought to attention by Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s book &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (1989). In this book, Gould put forth his opinion that Walcott failed to see the differences among the Burgess Shale species and &quot;shoehorned&quot; most of these fossils into existing phyla. Many paleontologists would now take a much less negative view of Walcott&#x27;s descriptions and of the theoretical perspective that shaped them.

Walcott&#x27;s work on Ordovician trilobites of New York also tended to be overlooked until, in the early 1990s, Rochester-based amateur paleontologist Thomas Whiteley revived Walcott&#x27;s research and re-opened the Walcott–Rust quarry near Russia, New York. This localized stratum has some of the best preserved Laurentian trilobites ever found, including enrolled specimens with soft body parts.

The Walcott Peak, near where he first discovered the Burgess Shale on Mount Burgess in Canada, was named after him. The nearby Walcott Quarry, with the Phyllopod bed of Burgess Shale fossils between Wapta Mountain and Mount Field, is also named for him. The Charles Doolittle Walcott Medal is awarded by the National Academy of Sciences every five years for outstanding work in the field of Precambrian and Cambrian life and history.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

The Wisconsin Timber Rattlers are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. They are located in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, a town on the outskirts of Appleton in the Fox Cities, and are named for the timber rattlesnake, which is more commonly found in southwest Wisconsin. The team plays their home games at Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium, which opened in 1995. They previously played at Goodland Field from their founding in 1958 until the end of the 1994 season.

Originally known as the Fox Cities Foxes, the team began play in 1958 as members of the Three–I League. The circuit suspended operations after the 1961 season, so the club joined the Midwest League in 1962. They became known as the Appleton Foxes in 1967 and adopted their Wisconsin Timber Rattlers moniker in 1995. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, Wisconsin was shifted to the High-A Central, which was renamed the Midwest League in 2022.

Wisconsin has served as a farm club for six Major League Baseball franchises. They have won ten league titles, including one Three–I League championship and nine Midwest League championships, most recently in 2012.

==History==
===Prior professional baseball in Appleton===

Appleton, the largest of Wisconsin&#x27;s Fox Cities, has hosted Minor League Baseball teams since the late 19th century. The city&#x27;s professional baseball history dates back to 1891 with the formation of the Appleton Papermakers in the single-season Wisconsin State League. The city was home to a new Papermakers team in the Wisconsin–Illinois League from 1909 to 1914. The Wisconsin State League was revived in 1940 with the Papermakers as members from 1940 to 1942 and 1946 to 1953 when the team and its league disbanded.

===Washington Senators (1958–1959)===
In 1958, the Fox Cities Foxes joined the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, popularly known as the Three–I League, as the Class B affiliate of the Washington Senators. Their home ballpark was Goodland Field in Appleton. This team was owned and operated by Appleton Baseball Club, Inc., a non-stock and nonprofit organization. Governed by a volunteer board of directors, this entity continued to own and operate the franchise through 2020.

The Foxes played their inaugural game on the road against the Davenport DavSox on April 27, 1958, a 9–2 victory. Their first home game, a 6–0 win over the Cedar Rapids Braves, was played on May 3. The Senators affiliation ended after two seasons with the Foxes having a 115–140 record over that period.

===Baltimore Orioles (1960–1965)===

Prior to the 1960 season, the team became an affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. Managed by future Baseball Hall of Famer Earl Weaver, they won the Three–I League championship pennant with a league-best 82–56 record in their first season with the Orioles. Third baseman Pete Ward was selected as the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, and first baseman Boog Powell won the Rookie of the Year Award. The team also included pitcher Pat Gillick, who was later inducted in the Hall of Fame as an executive. The Three–I League suspended operations after the 1961 season, hoping to resume in 1963.

As a result, Fox Cities joined the Class D Midwest League (MWL) for 1962. Despite a sub-.500 season, Cal Ripken Sr. won the 1962 Midwest League Manager of the Year Award. The MWL was reclassified as a Class A league in 1963. Manager Billy DeMars led the 1964 Foxes to win the second half title, qualifying them for a single championship game against the Clinton C-Sox. The Foxes won the game, giving them their first Midwest League championship. The affiliation with Baltimore ended after the 1965 season with the Foxes having a 401–352 record over the six-year period.

===Chicago White Sox (1966–1986)===

The Foxes joined the Chicago White Sox organization in 1966. The partnership began with the club winning back-to-back Midwest League championships. Stan Wasiak managed the 1966 squad to the first half title and a 2–0 championship series win over the Cedar Rapids Cardinals. In 1967, then known as the Appleton Foxes, Manager of the Year Alex Cosmidis&#x27; team won the second half title before sweeping the Wisconsin Rapids Twins in two games to win the MWL crown again. Two years later, Tom Saffell&#x27;s Foxes won both halves of the 1969 season and were named league champions without any playoffs being held. Saffell was selected for the league&#x27;s Manager of the Year Award.

Appleton won three Northern Division titles from 1971 to 1974, but they lost the league title each time in the final round. Joe Sparks was recognized as the MWL Manager of the Year for 1971. Future Hall of Fame pitcher Goose Gossage played with Appleton from 1970 to 1971 and in 1974. Fellow Hall of Famer Harold Baines began his career with the Foxes in 1977. The 1978 team, under the management of Gordon Lund, set a franchise record with their 97–40 season. Having won the first half, they went on to capture the Northern Division title versus the Waterloo Indians, 2–0, before beating the Burlington Bees, 2–1, to win their fifth MWL championship. Lund won the season&#x27;s Manager of the Year Award, and the team was recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all-time by baseball historians in 2001.

From 1982 to 1984, the Foxes won three consecutive Midwest League championships. Clinching a wild card berth in 1982, Appleton won the semifinals against the Springfield Cardinals, 2–0, then claimed the league title over the Madison Muskies, 2–1, under manager Adrian Garrett. The 1983 Northern Division champions, then led by John Boles, won the semifinals versus Waterloo, 2–1, then won a second consecutive championship against Springfield, 3–1. Sal Rende&#x27;s 1984 Foxes completed the back-to-back-to-back feat by winning the division, defeating Madison, 2–1, in the semifinals, and again taking the championship from Springfield in a full five-game series. The 1986 Foxes won another division title, but were kept from winning a fourth consecutive championship with elimination in the semifinals.

The White Sox affiliation ended after the 1986 season. Spanning 21 years, this was the longest affiliation in the minor league team&#x27;s history. It was also the most successful in terms of their win–loss record with the team going 1,471–1,261 over that stretch.

===Kansas City Royals (1987–1992)===
Appleton affiliated with the Kansas City Royals in 1987. Aside from a 71–69 finish in 1987 and a 70–62 record with a first half title in 1992, the Foxes finished under .500 in four out of six years with the Royals. Pitcher Tom Gordon led the Midwest League with 172 strikeouts in 1988 and was named the league&#x27;s Prospect of the Year. Tom Poquette, manager of the 1992 team, won the Manager of the Year Award. Appleton accumulated a 386–433 record during the affiliation.

===Seattle Mariners (1993–2008)===
Appleton became the Class A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners in 1993. On August 29, 1994, the Foxes played their final game at the 54-year-old Goodland Field. The 8–1 loss to the South Bend Silver Hawks was attended by a season-high 3,492 people. The team would move to the new $4.75-million Fox Cities Stadium in Grand Chute the next season. Also in 1995, after 37 seasons as the Foxes, the team rebranded as the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers. This change was made to increase their regional appeal outside the Fox Cities and to boost merchandise sales. &quot;Timber Rattlers&quot; was chosen by area school children who selected it from among three possible monikers along with several logos for each. The name refers to the timber rattlesnake, which is not typically found in the Appleton area but is more common in southwest Wisconsin. The team&#x27;s scheduled April 5, 1995, home opener at their new facility was postponed due to snow and rescheduled for the next afternoon as a doubleheader. The Timber Rattlers won both games, defeating the West Michigan Whitecaps, 3–1 and 8–6, before an audience of 1,937 people.

In 1994, shortstop Alex Rodriguez was selected as the league&#x27;s Prospect of the Year after hitting for a .319 batting average with 14 home runs and 55 RBI in just 65 games. Wisconsin failed to reach the postseason in their first three seasons with Seattle. As first-half winners in 1996, they won the Central Division title versus the Peoria Chiefs, 2–1, and then beat the Quad Cities River Bandits, 2–1, to advance to the championship round, but they were defeated by West Michigan, 3–1. The 1997 and 1998 teams repeated as first half champions, but were each eliminated in the divisional rounds. In 1999, the Timber Rattlers qualified for the postseason with a second half title, won the Central Division over the Rockford Reds, 2–0, advanced through the semifinals over the Lansing Lugnuts, 2–0, but again lost the championship to Burlington, 3–2. The team won second half titles and the quarterfinals in the next two seasons but were unable to win in the divisional rounds, and the 2003 first-half winners did not make it past the quarterfinals. In 2005, Wisconsin won both halves, the quarterfinals over the Beloit Snappers, 2–1, and the Western Division title against the Clinton LumberKings, 2–0, but failed to win the league championship as they were defeated by South Bend, 3–2.

The Mariners affiliation ended after the 2008 season without any further postseason appearances. Over the 16-year relationship, Wisconsin had a 1,077–1,124 record.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2009–present)===

The Timber Rattlers affiliated with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2009. Managed by Matt Erickson, Wisconsin qualified for the postseason in 2012 after a six-year absence from the playoffs. Having won the first half, they won the quarterfinals over Burlington, 2–1, and the Western Division title versus Clinton, 2–0. They ended the postseason by winning their ninth Midwest League championship over Fort Wayne, 3–1. That same season, the franchise won the Larry MacPhail Award for outstanding minor league promotions. Their most recent postseason appearances came in 2014 and 2016 via second half titles, but the Timber Rattlers were eliminated in each quarterfinal round.

Following the 2020 season, Appleton Baseball Club, Inc, sold the team to Third Base Ventures, LLC, a group consisting of principal owner Craig Dickman and minority owners team president Rob Zerjav and Brad Raaths. The group also purchased the team&#x27;s ballpark from the Fox Cities Amateur Sports Authority with plans to keep the team in Grand Chute. Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball before the 2021 season in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. As a result, the Midwest League disbanded and the Timber Rattlers were elevated to the High-A classification and placed in the High-A Central, where they continued their affiliation with Milwaukee. Wisconsin began competition in the new league on May 4 with a 2–1 victory over the Beloit Snappers at Fox Cities Stadium. They ended the season in third place in the West Division with a 59–60 record. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. Wisconsin placed second in both halves of the split-season, missing out on qualifying for the postseason. Their season record was 69–60. They did not win either half of the 2023 season in which they finished 62–68. The Timber Rattlers won the first-half of the 2024 season with a record of 42–44, clinching a spot in the playoffs. They won the Western Division title over the Quad Cities River Bandits, 2–0, but were defeated in the championship series by the Lake County Captains, 2–1. Wisconsin posted a season record of 77–54. Victor Estevez won the Midewest League Manager of the Year Award. Over 15 complete seasons of competition as a Brewers farm club, the Timber Rattlers hold a regular-season win–loss record of 976–1,057.

Wisconsin&#x27;s primary mascot is an anthropomorphic timber rattler snake named Fang. He is golden yellow with a red tongue extending from his mouth and wears the same uniform as the team. Fang is joined by Whiffer, a secondary mascot whose appearance resembles that of the Phillie Phanatic with teal fur and green face and hands.

Prior to Fang and the 1995 rebrand, Appleton&#x27;s mascot was Freddy Fox, an anthropomorphic fox who wore the team&#x27;s jersey and cap. Circa 1980, the mascot was Homer Run, who was human in appearance and wore the same style uniform as the Foxes.

==Roster==
==Achievements==
===Awards===

Four players and seven managers have won league awards in recognition for their performance with the Foxes/Timber Rattlers.



=== No-hitters ===

The Timber Rattlers have pitched 14 no-hitters in their franchise history. A no-hit game occurs when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits over the course of a game. A perfect game, a much rarer feat, occurs when no batters reach base by a hit or any other means, such as a walk, hit by pitch, or error. Wisconsin&#x27;s no-hitters were accomplished by a total of 19 pitchers. Nine were complete games pitched by a lone pitcher, and five were combined no-hitters.

<text>Imagery is visual symbolism, or figurative language that evokes a mental image or other kinds of sense impressions, especially in a literary work, but also in other activities such as. Imagery in literature can also be instrumental in conveying tone. 

==Forms==
There are five major types of sensory imagery, each corresponding to a sense, feeling, action, or reaction:

* &quot;Visual imagery&quot; pertains to graphics, visual scenes, pictures, or the sense of sight.
*&quot;Auditory imagery&quot; pertains to sounds, noises, music, or the sense of hearing. (This kind of imagery may come in the form of onomatopoeia).
*&quot;Olfactory imagery&quot; pertains to odors, aromas, scents, or the sense of smell.
*&quot;Gustatory imagery&quot; pertains to flavors or the sense of taste.
*&quot;Tactile imagery&quot; pertains to physical textures or the sense of touch.

Other types of imagery include:

*&quot;Kinesthetic imagery&quot; pertains to movements.
*&quot;Organic imagery / subjective imagery&quot;, pertains to personal experiences of a character&#x27;s body, including emotion and the senses of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and pain.
*&quot;Phenomenological&quot;, pertains to the mental conception of an item as opposed to the physical version.
*&quot;Color imagery&quot; is the ability to visualize a color in its absence.

<text>A traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG; : traditional specialities guaranteed) is a traditional food product protected under European Union and/or United Kingdom law. This label differs from the geographical indications protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI) in that the TSG label does not certify that the protected food product has a link to a specific geographical area, and thus a product can be produced outside the area or country from which it originates.

To qualify for the TSG label, a food must be of &quot;specific character&quot; and its raw materials, production method, or processing must be &quot;traditional&quot;. Title III of European Union Regulation 1151/2012 (Articles 17-26) deals with the TSG scheme, with specific terms defined in Article 3: &quot;specific character&quot; is defined as &quot;the characteristic production attributes which distinguish a product clearly from other similar products of the same category&quot;, and &quot;traditional&quot; is defined as &quot;proven usage on the domestic market for a period that allows transmission between generations; this period is to be at least 30 years&quot;.

For a food name to be registrable under the TSG scheme it must (a) have been traditionally used to refer to the specific product or (b) identify the traditional character or specific character of the product.

A TSG creates an exclusive right over the registered product name. Accordingly, the registered product name can be used by only those producers who conform to the registered production method and product specifications.

&quot;The legal function of the TSG is to certify that a particular agricultural product objectively possesses specific characteristics which differentiate it from all others in its category, and that its raw materials, composition or method of production have been consistent for a minimum of 30 years. Thus, TSG food denominations are registered trade signs with a distinctive function.&quot;

==Use of geographical indications in TSG==
Some TSG designations require the use of products with a protected designation of origin, protected geographical indication, or another traditional speciality guaranteed for their preparation.
*Pizza Napoletana requires the use of either the PDO mozzarella di bufala campana (made from buffalo) or the TSG mozzarella.
*Berthoud, which is a dish created from molten PDO cheese abondance, the PDO wine vin de Savoie, as well as either the PDO fortified wines madeira or port.
*Vincisgrassi alla maceratese is a baked pasta finished with the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano.

== Lists of TSG products by country ==
All 64 TSG registered before 1 March 2024 in the EU are also protected in the UK. As of 18 April 2021, 65 TSG have been registered (see list) in the UK and 70 in the EU, all of which originate from the EU or the UK. The distribution by country of application is shown below:

<text>Debra Lynn Messing (born August 15, 1968) is an American actress. After graduating from New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, Messing starred in the television series &quot;Ned and Stacey&quot; on Fox (1995–1997) and &quot;Prey&quot; on ABC (1998). She achieved her breakthrough role as Grace Adler, an interior designer, on the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (1998–2006, 2017–2020), for which she received seven Golden Globe Award nominations and five Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, winning once, in 2003.

From 2007 to 2008, Messing starred as Molly Kagan, the ex-wife of a Hollywood film mogul, on the television miniseries &quot;The Starter Wife&quot;, for which she received two Golden Globe nominations, a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, and a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. Thereafter, she appeared as Broadway playwright Julia Houston on the NBC musical drama &quot;Smash&quot; (2012–2013) and as homicide detective Laura Diamond on the NBC police-procedural comedy &quot;The Mysteries of Laura&quot; (2014–2016). From 2017 to 2020, Messing reprised her role as Grace Adler on NBC&#x27;s three season revival of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, garnering a ninth Golden Globe nomination for her performance.

Messing&#x27;s film work includes &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot; (1995), &quot;Jesus&quot; (1999), &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; (2002), &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; (2002), &quot;Along Came Polly&quot; (2004), &quot;The Wedding Date&quot; (2005), &quot;Lucky You&quot; (2007), &quot;The Women&quot; (2008), &quot;Nothing Like the Holidays&quot; (2008), &quot;Searching&quot; (2018), and &quot;13: The Musical&quot; (2022). She has also lent her voice to animated films such as &quot;&quot; (2004) and &quot;Open Season&quot; (2006).

==Early life==
Messing was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Sandra Ellen (née Simons), who worked as a professional singer, banker, and travel and real estate agent, and Brian Messing, a sales executive for a costume jewelry packaging manufacturer. Her family is Jewish, and emigrated to the U.S. from Russia; Przecław, Poland; and London, England. Messing had a Bat Mitzvah ceremony. When Messing was three, she moved with her parents and her older brother, Brett, to East Greenwich, Rhode Island.

While Messing&#x27;s parents encouraged her dream of becoming an actress, they also urged her to complete a liberal arts education before deciding on acting as a career. Following their advice, she attended Brandeis University, where, at her parents&#x27; request, three-quarters of her courses were not theater-related.

In 1990, after graduating &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Brandeis with a Bachelor of Arts in Theater Arts, Messing gained admission to the elite Grad Acting Program at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, which accepts 16 new students annually. She earned a Master of Fine Arts after three years.

==Career==
In 1993, Messing won acclaim for her performance as Harper in the pre-Broadway workshop production of Tony Kushner&#x27;s play &quot;Angels in America: Perestroika&quot;. Subsequently, she appeared in several episodes of the television series &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; during 1994 and 1995.

In 1995, Messing made her film debut in Alfonso Arau&#x27;s &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot; playing the unfaithful wife of main character Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves). This exposure led Fox to make her the co-star of the television sitcom &quot;Ned &amp; Stacey&quot;. The series lasted for two seasons, from 1995 to 1997. Messing appeared as Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s romantic interest in two episodes of the series &quot;Seinfeld&quot;: &quot;The Wait Out&quot; in 1996 and &quot;The Yada Yada&quot; in 1997. Messing turned down a starring role in another television sitcom to appear in Donald Margulies&#x27;s two-character play &quot;Collected Stories&quot;, which opened at the off-Broadway Manhattan Theatre Club. She also co-starred in the Tom Arnold vehicle &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; in 1997.

In 1998, Messing played a lead role as the bioanthropologist Sloan Parker on ABC&#x27;s dramatic science-fiction television series &quot;Prey&quot;. During this time, her agent approached her with the pilot script for the television show &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. Messing was inclined to take some time off, but the script intrigued her, and she auditioned for the role of Grace Adler, beating Nicollette Sheridan, who later guest-starred on the show as Grace&#x27;s romantic rival. &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; became a ratings success, and Messing received critical acclaim for her performance.

Director Woody Allen cast Messing in a supporting role in his film &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; (2002). Her film roles since include Richard Gere&#x27;s ill-fated wife in the supernatural thriller &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; (2002) and a supporting role as an unfaithful bride in &quot;Along Came Polly&quot; (2004). &quot;The Wedding Date&quot; (2005) was Messing&#x27;s first leading role in a high-profile film. It received mixed reviews but performed fairly well at the box office.

Messing was featured as a judge on the season finale of the second season of Bravo&#x27;s reality show &quot;Project Runway&quot;. Also in 2005, along with Megan Mullally, she was awarded the Women in Film Lucy Award in recognition of her excellence and innovation in her creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television.

She also starred in the television miniseries &quot;The Starter Wife&quot; (2007), which was nominated for ten Emmy Awards, including one for Messing for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie. In 2008, Messing reprised her role as Molly Kagan in the television series &quot;The Starter Wife&quot;, consisting of 10 episodes. In early 2010, Messing starred in the ABC comedy pilot &quot;Wright vs. Wrong&quot; for the 2010–2011 primetime season, but ABC did not pick-up the pilot.

In July 2011, Messing was ranked no. 22 on the TV Guide Network special, &quot;Funniest Women on TV&quot;. In February 2011, producers announced that Messing would star in a new NBC musical pilot called &quot;Smash&quot; for the 2011–2012 primetime season. In May 2011, it was reported that NBC picked up the show as a series for the 2011–2012 season. The show premiered on February 6, 2012. The show was later renewed for a second season after which it was cancelled.

Messing appeared with Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong and Leighton Meester in Frank Whaley&#x27;s drama film &quot;Like Sunday, Like Rain&quot; in 2014. For her performance, Messing won the 2014 Best Actress Award at The Williamsburg Independent Film Festival.

She made her Broadway debut in John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s play &quot;Outside Mullingar&quot; alongside Tony Award winner Brían F. O&#x27;Byrne, which began previews at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre on January 3, 2014. &quot;Outside Mullingar&quot; was nominated for Best Play for the 2014 (68th Annual) Tony Awards.

Messing starred in &quot;The Mysteries of Laura&quot;, a police procedural television show that premiered in September 2014. The series lasted for two seasons and ended in 2016. Messing portrayed Marjorie Houseman in the television remake of the film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; (1987). It aired on ABC in May 2017. She starred again as Grace Adler in the revival of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; on NBC. The revival aired for three seasons, from September 2017 to April 2020.

==Personal life==
Messing met Daniel Zelman, an actor and screenwriter, on their first day as graduate students at New York University in 1990. They were married on September 3, 2000, and lived in Manhattan. On April 7, 2004, Messing gave birth to their son, Roman. In December 2011, she and her husband separated after 11 years of marriage. Messing filed for divorce on June 5, 2012, and the divorce became official on March 1, 2016. Messing dated her &quot;Smash&quot; co-star Will Chase from the end of 2011 to October 2014. In 2012, she posed nude for the May issue of &quot;Allure&quot; magazine.

=== Activism ===
Messing supports the Democratic Party. In 2004, Messing started working on campaigns by knocking on doors and making phone calls. In 2018, Messing and Mandana Dayani founded a nonpartisan organization called &quot;I am a voter.&quot; to educate and mobilize voters. Before the runoff election in Georgia in 2021, Messing posted a message on Instagram directing followers to VoteRiders for information on voter ID requirements and assistance with obtaining an ID to vote.

<doc id="350389" wikidata="Q3115960" url="?curid=350389" title="Great Lakes Loons">
<text>The Great Lakes Loons are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers. They are located in Midland, Michigan, and play their home games at Dow Diamond, which opened in April 2007.

==History==

The Midwest League came to Battle Creek, in 1995 after the franchise formerly known as the Madison Hatters moved. The team was first known as the Battle Creek Golden Kazoos. Due to a trademark dispute and general fan dissatisfaction with the name (which is a nickname for the nearby city of Kalamazoo), the name was changed to the Michigan Battle Cats on March 9, 1995. 

The team was affiliated with the Boston Red Sox (1995–98) and Houston Astros (1999–2002). The team changed its name to the Battle Creek Yankees after becoming an affiliate of the New York Yankees in 2003. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays took over affiliation of the team after the 2004 season, and the team name was changed to the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays.

In January 2006, the Devil Rays were sold to the non-profit Michigan Baseball Foundation and relocated to Midland, Michigan, in 2007. The team was renamed the Great Lakes Loons. A lack of interest from the Battle Creek community was the main reason for the move. Reduced ticket prices (even a night when fans were actually &quot;offered&quot; a dollar to come to that night&#x27;s game) failed to pique the interest of local residents.

Naming rights for the Loons&#x27; stadium were purchased by Dow Chemical, which is headquartered in Midland. The company named the stadium &quot;Dow Diamond.&quot; Ground was broken on the stadium on April 11, 2006, with construction taking 367 days to complete. In September 2006, the team announced its new affiliation with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In November 2006, the Loons named Lance Parrish as the team&#x27;s first manager since the move to Michigan&#x27;s Tri-City Area. The first home game was played on April 13, 2007.

After nine seasons in Midland, the Loons went through an overhaul of their logos and brand to give the franchise a fresh, updated look heading into its 10th season in 2016.

On September 18, 2016, the Loons clinched their first Midwest League championship following a 9–8 victory over the Seattle Mariners-affiliated Clinton LumberKings. The Loons won the championship series 3–1, following three-game series victories over the Bowling Green Hot Rods (Tampa Bay Rays) and West Michigan Whitecaps (Detroit Tigers) in the previous rounds. The Loons were managed by Gil Velazquez.

The Loons have hosted the Midwest League All-Star Game on two occasions (2008 and 2017).

On August 23, 2019, the Loons hosted their largest crowd ever of 6,671 people.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Loons were organized into the High-A Central. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Season-by-season records==
==Mascot==
Lou E. Loon is the team mascot and Ambassador of Fun for the team. He&#x27;s an energetic bird who loves to dance at home games and make public appearances. The kids&#x27; play area at the diamond is named &quot;Lou E.&#x27;s Lookout&quot; in his honor. He often leads fans in his signature cheer, the &quot;Funky Feather&quot;, which won &quot;Best In-Game Promotion of the Year&quot; in 2009 for Minor League Baseball.

&quot;Rall E. Camel&quot; was introduced as the team&#x27;s second mascot in April 2012. He is an honorary deputy ambassador of mischief and is an ostensibly goofy addition to the staff of the Great Lakes Loons.

<doc id="350391" wikidata="Q363268" url="?curid=350391" title="Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union">
<text>Three European Union schemes of geographical indications and traditional specialties, known as [[protected designation of origin]] (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI), and [[traditional speciality guaranteed]] (TSG), promote and protect names of agricultural products and foodstuffs, wines and spirits. Products registered under one of the three schemes may be marked with the logo for that scheme to help identify those products. The schemes are based on the legal framework provided by the EU Regulation No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs. This regulation applies within the EU as well as in Northern Ireland. Protection of the registered products is gradually expanded internationally via bilateral agreements between the EU and non-EU countries. It ensures that only products genuinely originating in that region are allowed to be identified as such in commerce. The legislation first came into force in 1992. The purpose of the law is to protect the reputation of the regional foods, promote rural and agricultural activity, help producers obtain a premium price for their authentic products, and eliminate the unfair competition and misleading of consumers by non-genuine products, which may be of inferior quality or of a different flavour. Critics argue that many of the names, sought for protection by the EU, have become commonplace in trade and should not be protected.

These regulations protect the names of wines, cheeses, hams, sausages, seafood, olives, olive oils, beers, balsamic vinegar, regional breads, fruits, raw meats and vegetables.

Based on these regulations, within the EU (and certain jurisdictions outside the EU), food such as gorgonzola, Parmigiano-Reggiano, feta, the Waterford blaas, Herve cheese, Melton Mowbray pork pies, Piave cheese, Asiago cheese, camembert, Provence honey, Herefordshire cider, cognac, armagnac, and champagne can only be labelled as such if they come from the designated region. To qualify as roquefort, for example, cheese must be made from milk of a certain breed of sheep, and matured in the natural caves near the town of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon in the Aveyron region of France, where it is colonised by the fungus &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; that grows in these caves.

Due to the horizontal and exhaustive nature of the legal regime, this system transcends national appellation systems used throughout Europe, such as the &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) used in France, the (DOC) used in Italy, the &quot;denominação de origem controlada&quot; (DOC) used in Portugal, the &quot;denumire de origine controlată&quot; (DOC) system used in Romania and the (DO) system used in Spain. The regulations still allow member states to use their own languages in packaging, but geographical indications law is still the sole domain of the EU. The EU Commission has the final word on applications for protection. 

A new EU Regulation on geographical indication protection for craft and industrial products was published on 27 October 2023 and entered into force on 16 November 2023. Producers and manufacturers of these products will be able to file applications for GI protection with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) from 1 December 2025. Only the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) logo will be applicable for craft and industrial products.

== Protection and enforcement ==
In countries where laws on protected geographical status are enforced, only products which meet the various geographical and quality criteria may use the protected indication. It is also prohibited to combine the indication with words such as &quot;style&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;imitation&quot;, or &quot;method&quot; in connection with the protected indications or to do anything which might imply that the product meets the specifications, such as using distinctive packaging associated with the protected product.

Protected indications are treated as intellectual property rights by the Customs Regulation 1383/2003 (Regulation concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights and the measures to be taken against goods found to have infringed such rights), and infringing goods may be seized by customs on import. Within the European Union, enforcement measures vary: infringement may be treated as counterfeit, misleading advertising, passing off or even as a question of public health. Outside Europe, the protection of PGS products usually requires bilateral agreements between the EU and the importing countries, while protected indications may not always supersede other intellectual property rights such as trademarks.

On 15 November 2011, the European Court of Auditors presented its report &quot;Do the design and management of the geographical indications scheme allow it to be effective?&quot; to the European Parliament.

== Objectives of the protection ==

The preambles to the regulations cite consumer demand for quality foodstuffs, and identify a number of goals for the protection regimes:
* the promotion of products with specific characteristics, particularly those coming from less-favoured or rural areas;
* the improvement of the income of farmers, in return for a &quot;genuine effort to improve quality&quot;;
* the retention of population in rural areas;
* the provision of clear and succinct information to consumers regarding product origin.
The provision of recompense for efforts to improve quality and the need for consumer protection are often cited as justifications for trade mark protection in other domains, and geographical indications operate in a similar manner to trademarks.

== General regime ==
The general regime governs the use of protected designations of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indications (PGI) for food and certain other agricultural products. There are separate regimes for spirits and aromatised drinks (geographical designations) as well as for wines (geographical indications, often referred to as appellations). The origin of the product is only one of the criteria for use of the protected terms: the product must also meet various quality criteria. The label &quot;Traditional Specialities Guaranteed&quot; (TSG) is a similar protected term which does not impose any restrictions on the geographical origin of the product.

The protection of geographical indications was extended to foodstuffs and other agricultural products in 1992. Given the widely different national provisions, this &quot;general regime&quot; gives much more power to the European Commission (compared to the special regimes) to ensure harmonised protection across the European Union. It is currently governed by the Regulation on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (No 510/2006).

To qualify for a PDO, the product must have qualities and characteristics which are essentially due to its region of production: it must also be produced, processed and prepared exclusively within that region. The requirements for a PGI are slightly less strict; a good reputation of a product from a given region is sufficient (rather than objectively different characteristics) if any of the steps of production, processing and preparation may take place within the region. Otherwise, the protection afforded by the two terms is equivalent.

An application for a PDO or a PGI is first made to the authorities of the relevant Member State. It is judged by the Member State against the criteria in the Regulation and, if found to be acceptable, forwarded to the European Commission for final approval. Applications are published at both the national and Community stages of examination, and third parties can object to proposed PDOs or PGIs which they feel would harm their business. A recurrent objection is that the proposed denomination is a generic term for the product in question: generic names cannot be registered but, once registered, the denominations are protected from genericisation. Hence Cheddar cheese was deemed to be a generic name, but the PDO &quot;West Country farmhouse Cheddar cheese&quot; was allowed. Feta was deemed not to have become generic, and was registered as a PDO to the disappointment of cheesemakers outside of Greece.

== Description of the regimes ==
=== Protected designation of origin (PDO) ===
The protected designation of origin is the name of an area, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, the name of a country, used as a designation for an agricultural product or a foodstuff,
* which comes from such an area, place or country,
* whose quality or properties are significantly or exclusively determined by the geographical environment, including natural and human factors,
* whose production, processing and preparation take place within the determined geographical area.

In other words, to receive the PDO status, the entire product must be traditionally and entirely manufactured (prepared, processed &quot;and&quot; produced) within the specific region and thus acquire unique properties.

=== Protected geographical indication (PGI) ===

The protected geographical indication is the name of an area, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, the name of a country, used as a description of an agricultural product or a foodstuff.
* which comes from such an area, place or country,
* which has a specific quality, goodwill or other characteristic property, attributable to its geographical origin,
* at least one of the stages of production, processing or preparation takes place in the area.

In other words, to receive the PGI status, the entire product must be traditionally and at least partially manufactured (prepared, processed &quot;or&quot; produced) within the specific region and thus acquire unique properties.

=== Traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG) ===

The TSG quality scheme aims to provide a protection regime for traditional food products of a specific character. Differing from PDO and PGI, this quality scheme does not certify that the protected food product has a link to a specific geographical area and that a product can thus be produced outside the area or country from which it originates.

To qualify for a TSG a food must be of &quot;specific character&quot; and either its raw materials, production method or processing must be &quot;traditional&quot;. Under Art. 3 of Regulation 1151/12 &quot;specific character&quot; is defined as &quot;the characteristic production attributes which distinguish a product clearly from other similar products of the same category&quot;. Under Art. 3 of Regulation 1151/12 &quot;traditional&quot; is defined as &quot;proven usage on the domestic market for a period that allows transmission between generations; this period is to be at least 30 years&quot;.

For a food name to be registrable under the TSG scheme it must (a) have been traditionally used to refer to the specific product; or (b) identify the traditional character or specific character of the product.

A TSG creates an exclusive right over the registered product name. Accordingly, the registered product name can be used by only those producers who conform to the registered production method and product specifications.

&quot;The legal function of the TSG is to certify that a particular agricultural product objectively possesses specific characteristics which differentiate it from all others in its category, and that its raw materials, composition or method of production have been consistent for a minimum of 30 years. Thus, TSG food denominations are registered trade signs with a distinctive function.&quot;

As of 14 November 2021, 65 TSG have been registered (see list), all of which originate from the EU or the UK.

== Relationship to trademark law ==
In principle, a similar protection to a geographical indication could be obtained through a collective trademark. Indications which serve exclusively to identify the place of origin of goods are not registrable as trademarks under Art. 6quinquies.B.2 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention), which has effect in European Union law by Art. 7 of the Regulation on the Community trade mark (No 40/94) and by Art. 3 of the Directive to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trademarks (89/104/EEC); however, marks which also serve to identify the quality of a product originating in a certain region may be registered so long as they have not become generic in the trade concerned.

Trademarks which have been registered before the registration of a PDO or a PGI may continue to be used, but the registration of an equivalent trademark after the approval of a PDO or PGI is impossible (Art. 13, Regulation (EC) No 510/2006). The existence of a trademark (registered or unregistered) &quot;may&quot; be a reason to refuse the registration of a PDO or a PGI [Art. 7(3)(c), Regulation (EC) No 510/2006]. Hence the Polish geographical designation &quot;Herbal vodka from the North Podlasie Lowland aromatised with an extract of bison grass&quot; (), so phrased as to avoid infringing the trademark &quot;.&quot;

== Special regimes ==
The protection of geographical indications for wines and other alcoholic drinks was historically the first to be developed at both national and Community levels. It is also the only protection which is recognised by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), administered by the World Trade Organization, although the European Union is pushing for other geographical indications to be included in the Doha Round of world trade negotiations.

=== Wines ===

European Union rules governing the production of wine (&quot;the product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes, whether or not crushed, or of grape must&quot;) are considerably longer than EU trade mark law: the main text, the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine (No 1493/1999), runs to over 46,000 words. To be considered as a &quot;quality wine&quot;, the wine must come from a specified region and be associated with a &quot;geographical indication&quot; or &quot;appellation&quot;: indeed, the technical term used in the Regulation is quality wine psr, with the &quot;psr&quot; standing for &quot;produced in a specified region&quot;. Wines which do not meet this requirement may only be marketed as table wine.

There has been little harmonisation of national provisions within the European Union. Member States delimit the specified areas of production and determine the rules and appellations which apply: the European Commission restricts itself to publishing the information provided by the Member States. Appellations are usually the geographical name of the area in which the wine is produced, although there are some historical exceptions: muscadet and blanquette in France, cava and manzanilla in Spain and vinho verde in Portugal. The appellations are not necessarily unique: &quot;Cava&quot; may refer either to a quality sparkling wine psr produced in Spain or to a Greek table wine which has been aged (as a transliteration of &quot;Κάβα&quot;).

=== Spirits ===
The Regulation laying down general rules on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and protection of spirit drinks (110/2008) provides for a double system of protection of spirit descriptions. Spirits are divided into 46 categories, which each have rules for fabrication and minimum strength. Within these categories, certain names are reserved for drinks from particular countries, for example ouzo, which is aniseed-flavoured spirit drink which must have been produced exclusively in Greece or Cyprus, or grappa, which is a grape marc spirit produced in Italy, or pálinka, which is a purely fruit based spirit produced in Hungary (or parts of Austria for apricot spirits only). The Regulation also defines a number of &quot;geographical designations&quot;, which are reserved for drinks which &quot;acquired their character and definitive qualities&quot; in the area denominated. The exact delimitation of the areas and any other regulations are left to the Member States concerned. By way of derogation, the designations Königsberger Bärenfang and Ostpreußischer Bärenfang are permitted for certain German drinks even though they refer to Königsberg (Kaliningrad) and East Prussia which are no longer part of Germany.

=== Aromatised drinks ===
The Regulation laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatised wines, aromatised wine-based drinks and aromatised wine-product cocktails (No 251/2014) institutes a system of protected denominations for aromatised drinks which is very similar to that for spirits. The association of general names with specific countries is weaker: a drink labelled simply &quot;Sangria&quot; must have been produced in Spain or Portugal, for example, but it is permissible to label a drink &quot;Sangria produced in the United Kingdom: aromatised wine-based drink&quot; if the drink meets the other requirements to be described as sangria. Similarly, the denomination &quot;Clarea&quot; on its own is reserved for drinks produced in Spain. As of January 2020, the protected geographical designations are:
* Vermouth di Torino (vermouth original: 1757) (Italy)
* Nürnberger Glühwein (Germany)
* Thüringer Glühwein
* Vermouth de Chambéry (France)
* Samoborski bermet

==Within the European Union==
Article 13 of this legislation states that registered designations are protected against:
This legislation expanded the 1951 Stresa Convention, which was the first international agreement on cheese names. Seven countries participated: Austria, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.

Selected products include Prosciutto Toscano (PDO) from Italy, bryndza podhalańska (PDO) and oscypek (PDO) from Poland, Marchfeldspargel (PGI) from Austria, Lübecker Marzipan (PGI) from Germany, Scotch Beef and Lamb (PGI) from Scotland, bryndza (PGI) and Oštiepok (PGI) from Slovakia, Kaszëbskô malëna (Kashubian garden strawberry) (PGI) from Poland.

In certain cases, the name of widely popular products became generic, and therefore could not be protected afterwards. Cheddar cheese, for instance, originating in the English village of Cheddar, is produced in many countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Hence the &quot;Cheddar&quot; name is not protected, but the more specific name &quot;West Country Farmhouse Cheddar&quot; is. Other products are protected in Europe but not elsewhere: Buffalo Mozzarella for instance is protected in Europe, but the name is used without restrictions by US dairy companies.

The geographical limitations are strict: Newcastle Brown Ale was restricted to being brewed in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in England. However, having obtained this protection for their product, the brewery decided in 2004 that it would move across the river Tyne to Gateshead. As Gateshead is a separate town—albeit only the width of the river apart—it does not fall within the required geographical restriction. The brewery then applied to the European Union authorities to have the geographical restriction revoked. If the restriction had not been revoked, the brewery would have been forced either to move back to Newcastle, or stop calling its beer &quot;Newcastle&quot; brown ale. Ultimately, the brewery&#x27;s application to revoke the geographic restriction was approved. Similarly, Stilton cheese can only be produced in the three English counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Nottinghamshire. Stilton village is in the traditional county of Huntingdonshire, now a district of Cambridgeshire, so Stilton cheese cannot be produced in Stilton (although it is unclear whether the cheese was ever produced there. Quenby Hall in Leicestershire claims to be the first producer).

New Season Comber Potatoes or Comber Earlies were awarded PGI status in 2012. Only immature potatoes grown in the restricted geographical area surrounding the town of Comber in Northern Ireland harvested between the start of May and the end of July can be marketed as Comber Earlies.

==Outside the European Union==
There is no automatic protection for these names on products both made and sold outside the EU, except for Northern Ireland, where the relevant regulation applies. However, there are a number of bilateral agreements with the EU for some level of enforcement. Agreements of this type exist between the EU and Australia (wine, 1994) (but not cheese), Canada (wine and spirits, 2003), China, Chile (wine and spirits, 2002), Colombia (2007, coffee) Mexico (1997, spirit drinks), and South Africa (2002, wine and spirits).

Besides dedicated agreements on geographical indications, mutual recognition of geographical indications is part of free trade agreements, such as Association Agreements (e.g. with Armenia, Ukraine and Moldova). Geographical indications are (following an objection period where GIs can be refused) furthermore protected in the member states of the 2015 Geneva Act to the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration, to which (apart from the EU and some of its member states) also Albania, Cambodia, Samoa, Laos and North Korea are parties. However, as of August 2021, the EU has not submitted any Geographical Indications for registration.

As the Geographic indication scheme of the EU is not limited to products from EU locations, also products from outside the EU have received the designation. For example Colombian coffee was protected by the PDO in August 2007.

===Australia===
Following an agreement during the 1990s by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the Australian and EU governments, the others&#x27; GIs and the nations&#x27; traditional terms of winemaking were meant to have been protected by 1997. However, this has been proceeding slowly, and while some GIs have been protected in Australia, others are still available for use (primarily for products that have always been called that). It seems unlikely it will have any effect on colloquial speech in the short term.

===China===

China recognizes Geographical Indication Products. One such product is Yongfeng chili sauce (), also called Yongfeng hot sauce.

===Canada===
In Canada, a 2003 agreement made with the EU provides for the protection of the names of wine and spirits.

Under the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the EU, Canada agrees &quot;to protect 143 geographical indications for high-quality European products, such as Italian balsamic vinegar from Modena, Dutch Gouda cheese or Roquefort cheese and many others.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
After Brexit, the UK has its own Protected Geographical Indication scheme, independently of the EU one, but based on the same requirements. All existing EU geographic indications on 31 December 2020 are protected under UK law (as well as EU law), but this is not the case for designations registered after that date.

==List of products with PDO/PGI/TSG classifications==

The register of wines, agricultural products and spirits with a European Union Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) or Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) is in eAmbrosia, Traditional Specialities Guaranteed (TSG) have a separate register. Both are at the European Agriculture site.

Note that the database contains both approved designations (status &quot;Registered&quot;) and designations not yet approved (status &quot;Applied&quot; or &quot;Published&quot;).

More information can also be found in GIview, a GI database by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and the European Commission.

== Criticisms of Protected Geographical Status framework ==

Somewhat paradoxically the PGS framework can be posited as both a protectionist move against global agro-economic policy, and a market-based neoliberal tool of agricultural governance. This makes it an equally important battleground for both the anti-globalization movement, and the free-trade proponents of Australia and the United States, and a number of criticisms of each have been put forward:

=== Issues of governance ===

* Conceding the market as the locus of regulation. Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms have slowly introduced a raft of market-based instruments (MBIs) to regulate the agro-food sector (the PGS framework is one of them). The market is seen as the ideal &quot;arms-length&quot; mechanism with which to foster growth, re-balance imperfections in the connected industries and add previously uncalculated value to European produce. But their social and ecological protections are perpetually unequal, falling short of providing any instance of a Polanyian &quot;double-movement&quot;. That is, generating a societal reaction to the &quot;dehumanizing&quot; effects of the self-regulating market.
* Creating markets where none previously existed. By creating so-called &quot;ethical food markets&quot;, food producers have been able to command a greater price for their goods. The PDO/PGI regimes foster the creation of ethical food markets, predicated on &quot;local&quot; produce. For example, traditional Grimsby smoked fish producers have seen PGI accreditation &quot;help keep the margins up&quot;, in difficult economic circumstances. In these instances, the &quot;local&quot; is valorised as inherently &quot;good&quot; or at least better than produce from an unrestricted, globalised food market.
* Providing barriers to entry. The drawing of boundaries around certain food and drink products prevents other actors from entering particular markets. On this point, the PGS framework can potentially deny (or make extremely difficult) entry into the agro-food sector. For example, there are stringent geographical, productive, facilitative, planning, temporal and skilled constraints to entry into the Stilton cheese market in the UK. The successful application to protect the Cornish pasty is another recent example; with Ginsters of Cornwall central to the bid (itself owned by the &quot;extra-local&quot;, Leicestershire-based Samworth Brothers – also makers of fellow PGS protected Melton Mowbray Pork Pies).
* Narrowing competition in existing markets. Where markets already exist, there is the propensity for the narrowing of competition, if certain PGS applications are accepted. The state – instead of absolving all responsibility (often thought of as occurring in a neoliberal economy) – is tied with the task of carefully controlling the market. Product price fixing, supermarket consolidation, labour control, and profit-channelling are all potential issues. Within the UK, the Competition Commission is charged with investigating regulatory powers vis-à-vis markets and company mergers, to prevent (or at least temper) such problems.
* Geographically fixing capital. Due to the nature of the PGS framework, capital is concentrated in particular areas. As rights are not directly transferable, PGI/PDO certification is granted to those with landed property rights. Monopolised (and thus higher) land rents can often result; to the detriment of those who rely on such lands.
* Devolving power to consumers. Some proponents have suggested that ethical food markets – and the PGS framework directly – has furthered a &quot;cash till&quot; form of political democracy, whereby consumer spending power can masquerade as a legitimate governance structure and mechanism (i.e. democratically voted, representative, and therefore accountable). This is part of a broader shift from forms of &quot;government&quot; to &quot;governance&quot; seen in a neoliberalizing world, where a raft of non-state actors, arguably, make informed decisions about where and what to purchase.

=== Other criticisms ===
The U.S. and Australia have disagreed with the EU&#x27;s characterization of Geographical Indications. They disagree with the idea that Geographical Indications &quot;eliminate the unfair competition and misleading of consumers,&quot; but rather that many of these names have become generic, and do not reflect a reputation of a distinctive product originating in a certain region. They also believe that the EU is monopolizing markets and not allowing for fair competition. As the EU continues to enter trade agreements with third-party countries, often they will force these countries to agree to their list of Geographical Indications as a condition of the trade agreement, eliminating competition by the U.S. or Australia that may already be operating in the country.

<doc id="350392" wikidata="Q770219" url="?curid=350392" title="Augustus C. Dodge">
<text>Augustus Caesar Dodge (January 4, 1812November 21, 1883) was a Democratic delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives from Iowa Territory, a U.S. minister to Spain, and one of the first set of United States senators to represent Iowa after it was admitted to the Union as a state. His father, Henry Dodge, served as a U.S. senator from Wisconsin; the two were the first and so far the only father-son pair to serve concurrently in the Senate, which they did from 1848 to 1855.

Augustus Dodge was born in what is now Ste. Genevieve, Missouri (then in Louisiana Territory). Self-educated, he moved to Illinois in 1827, settled in Galena, and was employed there in various capacities in his father&#x27;s lead mines. He served in the Black Hawk War and other Indian wars. In 1837, he moved to what is now Burlington, Iowa (then in Wisconsin Territory), where he served as register of the land office until 1840.

== Delegate ==
Congress created Iowa Territory in 1838, from what was formerly the Iowa District of Wisconsin Territory. As a result of the Act of March 3, 1839, the position of Iowa Territory&#x27;s Delegate to the U.S. House would become vacant on October 27, 1840, and Dodge was elected to fill it. After initially serving in the Twenty-sixth United States Congress, he was re-elected in 1840 (to the Twenty-seventh Congress), 1842 (to the Twenty-eighth Congress), and 1844 (to the Twenty-ninth Congress). He served as delegate until Iowa became a state in December 1846, and his role was replaced by two voting Representatives.

== Senator==
For its first two years, the Iowa General Assembly failed to choose Iowa&#x27;s first U.S. senators, due to a three-way split that prevented any candidate from earning the required number of 30 legislators&#x27; votes. However, after the 1848 elections gave the Democratic Party a greater share of Iowa legislators, Dodge (and George Wallace Jones) were elected as Iowa&#x27;s first two U.S. senators. By drawing lots, Dodge received the seat with the shorter term (to expire in 1849), but was re-elected that year to a full six-year term. While in the Senate, he served as chairman of the committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses (in the Thirty-first and Thirty-second Congresses), the Committee on Pensions (in the Thirty-first Congress), the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (in the Thirty-second Congress), and the Committee on Public Lands (in the Thirty-third Congress).

On December 14, 1853, Dodge introduced a bill to organize the new territory of Nebraska. Under the leadership of Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas, that bill eventually became the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which Dodge supported forcefully.

In 1854, as Dodge&#x27;s second term was near its end, the Iowa General Assembly chose Free Soil Party member (and future Republican) James Harlan, rather than Dodge. Dodge was the preferred choice of Democratic legislators, whose ranks had declined. But in a failed effort to defeat Harlan by uniting Democrats and nationalist Whigs behind a single candidate, Dodge dropped out after the fourth ballot.
Dodge served in the Senate until February 22, 1855, when President Franklin Pierce appointed him to the post of minister to Spain. He served as the minister until 1859.

== Life after the Senate ==
Dodge unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Iowa in 1859, losing to Republican Samuel J. Kirkwood. He served as mayor of Burlington, Iowa from 1874 to 1875.

In 1868, Dodge supported the candidacy of George H. Pendleton for the Democratic presidential nomination.
During that same election year, Dodge himself had been mentioned for the vice-presidency. &quot;His nomination&quot;, said &quot;The Democratic Watchman&quot; (Bellfontaine, Pennsylvania) &quot;would probably give satisfaction to as many Democrats as that of any other western man.&quot; Looking toward the 1872 presidential election, Dodge recommended Thomas A. Hendricks as a &quot;worthy, able and excellent man.&quot; He believed that there was strong support throughout the Midwest for the Indianan, although he doubted that Hendricks would run well in the East.

He died in Burlington, Iowa on November 20, 1883, and was interred in Aspen Grove Cemetery in Burlington.

Dodge was the nephew of Missouri Senator Lewis F. Linn. His brother-in-law James Clarke served as the third and last Governor of Iowa Territory.

==Legacy==
Dodge County, Nebraska and Dodge Street in Omaha, Nebraska were named after Augustus Dodge. His home in Burlington, Iowa is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Augustus Caesar Dodge House.

Also, Augustus C. Dodge is numbered among the honored pioneers of Des Moines County, and during his life was among the most noted men. He sprang from good old Revolutionary stock, and the patriotism of his ancestors found an abiding-place in his heart.

<text>Bolsover is a market town and the administrative centre of the Bolsover District, Derbyshire, England. It is from Sheffield, from Nottingham and from Derby. It is the main town in the Bolsover district.

The civil parish for the town is called Old Bolsover. It includes the town and the New Bolsover model village, along with Hillstown, Carr Vale,
Shuttlewood, Stanfree, Oxcroft, and Whaley. Its population at the 2011 UK Census was 11,673.

Bolsover, along with several nearby villages, is situated in the north-east of the county of Derbyshire. It is the main town in the District of Bolsover, which is an electoral constituency and part of Derbyshire.

Bolsover sought city status in the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours, but the bid was unsuccessful.

==History==
The origin of the name is uncertain. It may be derived from &quot;Bula&#x27;s Ofer&quot; or &quot;Boll&#x27;s Ofer&quot;, respectively the Old English for &quot;Bull&#x27;s Ridge&quot; and &quot;Boll&#x27;s Ridge&quot; (the ridge associated with a person named &quot;Boll&quot;); in the 1650s it was referred to as &#x27;Bolsouer&#x27;.

Bolsover is mentioned in Domesday Book, named as Belesovre, where it is described as the property of William Peverel (or &quot;Peveril&quot;). The description refers to the villans, the ploughs, ) of meadow and woodland pasture, which is given as two leagues by a league. Bolsover became the seat of the Peverel family, and in the 12th century a keep was built. The present castle was erected in 1613.

In 1657 the leading Royalist William Cavendish, 1st Marquess of Newcastle, published his book &quot;La Methode et Invention nouvelle de dresser les Chevaux&quot;, written in exile in Antwerp during the Cromwellian Protectorate. This was translated in 1743 to &quot;A General System of Horsemanship in All its Branches&quot;. It covered the dressage of horses, at his &#x27;Bolsouer&#x27;, Welbeck Abbey, and Antwerp stables and contains engravings attributed to Abraham van Diepenbeeck showing Newcastle on a horse (&#x27;Monsieur le Marquis a Cheval&#x27;) and views of his estates, including Bolsover.

The district of Bolsover is notable for three sites of historical importance: Bolsover Castle, Creswell Crags (home to Britain&#x27;s only known Palaeolithic cave art) and Creswell Model Village, an example of early twentieth century design from the model village movement.

Two railway lines once served Bolsover, but both were early casualties. The Midland Railway (later part of the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway), arrived first with their north–south running Doe Lea line from Staveley to Pleasley, opened in September 1890 and thus enabling a through service between Chesterfield and Mansfield to be operated, but services were withdrawn as early as September 1930. Bolsover Castle station served the town.

The other line was the highly ambitious west–east running Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway, later part of the Great Central Railway and subsequently the London &amp; North Eastern Railway. Only the middle section from Chesterfield to Lincoln was ever built, opening in March 1897 (the Bolsover station was Bolsover South), but the section between Chesterfield and Shirebrook was brought to a premature demise in December 1951 by the deteriorating state of its biggest engineering feature, the 2,624-yard (2,399-metre) Bolsover Tunnel which ran beneath the limestone ridge on which stands the castle. The tunnel was mostly filled in with colliery waste in 1966–67, and both ends sealed off. Today both portals are visible, the eastern portal at the end of an unusually deep sheer-sided cutting in the village of Scarcliffe and the western portal just to the south east side of Bolsover.

In chronostratigraphy, the British sub-stage (formerly &#x27;stage&#x27;) of the Carboniferous period, the &#x27;Bolsovian&#x27; derives its name from a geological exposure at the River Doe Lea, Bolsover.

Bolsover Hospital was completed in 1988 but closed in spring 2019.

==Economy==
The major industry of the area used to be coal mining, but this has declined throughout all of Britain. The two main collieries closed in 1993. Markham Colliery, west of the town, closed on 2 July 1993. Bolsover Colliery, one of the five mines owned by the Bolsover Colliery Company closed on 7 May 1993. The Bolsover Colliery Company was one of the companies in the original FT 30 list of companies. The other main employer was the Coalite and Chemical Company, which produced smokeless fuel and chemicals from coke and was founded in 1937, and moved its main headquarters from London to Bolsover in 1952. It was closed in 2004 after a decline in demand for solid fuel, which had left the company and its many subsidiaries deeply in debt. Its production of chemicals used to produce Agent Orange in the Vietnam War and its environmental impact on surrounding communities of Duckmanton, Shuttlewood, New Bolsover and Bolsover itself had rendered it a controversial company.

Another significant local employer was The Bolsover Hosiery Company Ltd, which was established in 1951 by Bolsover Urban District Council. The main factory site on Oxcroft Lane employed approximately 500 people at its peak in the late 1990s. It underwent a succession of takeovers, eventually becoming part of Courtald&#x27;s Textiles. The company was taken over by the Sara Lee conglomerate and the factory closed in 2000 with the loss of approximately 350 jobs.

==Governance and politics==

Bolsover has three levels of local government. The civil parish of Old Bolsover is administered by Old Bolsover Town Council. The parish falls within the wider Bolsover District, and other functions are exercised by Derbyshire County Council.

The town falls within the Bolsover parliamentary constituency. The MP for the constituency from 1970 until 2019 was the Labour Party&#x27;s Dennis Skinner, a former miner. He lost his seat in the 2019 election to the Conservative Mark Fletcher. Labour regained the seat in 2024.

==Sport==
Bolsover Colliery F.C. used to play in the FA Cup. Current club F.C. Bolsover, founded in 2013, played in the Northern Counties East Football League for the 2018/19 season.

==Local media==
Regional TV news is provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from either the Emley Moor or Chesterfield TV transmitters. BBC East Midlands region is also the default BBC One variant given to Bolsover postcodes on Channel 101 through satellite television such as Freesat.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield on 94.7 FM, Greatest Hits Radio North Derbyshire on 107.4 FM, Mansfield Radio on 103.2 FM and Elastic Radio, a community-based radio station which broadcast online.

The &quot;Derbyshire Times&quot; is the weekly local newspaper that serves the town.

==Television==
In 2007 Bolsover was chosen as the location to shoot the film &quot;Summer&quot; starring Robert Carlyle and Rachael Blake. Many scenes from the film were filmed on the Castle Estate, which is affectionately known by the Bolsover residents as the &#x27;Wimps&#x27; (because it was built, in the 1950s, by George Wimpey, the construction company) and lies just underneath Bolsover Castle. Other parts of the film were filmed in Whitwell, Bramley Vale and Shirebrook Community school, just a few miles from Bolsover. &quot;Summer&quot; was released on 5 December 2008. The trailer for &quot;Summer&quot; was released in late November and contained a few scenes which showed the Castle Estate in Bolsover containing the top of Springfield Crescent and also Hyndley Road. In an interview in late November, director Kenneth Glenaan and Robert Carlyle agreed that Bolsover was the perfect setting for the film as it &quot;has been left in the past&quot;. It also said that going from Matlock to Bolsover is like going to a different country and that the Castle Estate is &quot;the land time forgot&quot;.

<text>Eastleigh is a town in Hampshire, England, between Southampton and Winchester. It is the largest town and the administrative seat of the Borough of Eastleigh, with a population of 24,011 at the 2011 census.

The town lies on the River Itchen, one of England&#x27;s premier chalk streams for fly fishing, and a designated site of Special Scientific Interest. The area was originally villages until the 19th century, when Eastleigh was developed as a railway town by the London and South Western Railway.

== History ==


The modern town of Eastleigh lies on the old Roman road, built in A.D.79 between Winchester &quot;(Venta Belgarum)&quot; and Bitterne &quot;(Clausentum)&quot;. Roman remains discovered in the Eastleigh area, including a Roman lead coffin excavated in 1908, indicate that a settlement probably existed here in Roman times.

A Saxon village called &#x27;East Leah&#x27; has been recorded to have existed since 932 AD. (&#x27;Leah&#x27; is an ancient Anglo-Saxon word meaning &#x27;a clearing in a forest&#x27;). There is additional evidence of this settlement in a survey from the time which details land in North Stoneham being granted by King Æthelstan to his military aid, Alfred in 932 AD. The prefix &#x27;Est&#x27; or &#x27;East&#x27; is thought to refer to its location relative to the established settlement of Baddesley.

The Domesday Book of 1086 gives a more detailed account of the settlement, which is referred to as &#x27;Estleie&#x27;.

In 1838 the London and South Western Railway Company (L&amp;SWR) built a railway from Southampton to Winchester. It was decided to build a station near the little village of Barton. This railway station was originally named Bishopstoke Junction. In 1868 the villages of Barton and Eastley were combined into one parish. A parish church, the Church of the Resurrection, was built in the same year, at a cost of £2,300. A local noted author of many novels, Charlotte Yonge, donated £500 towards the building of the church. She was rewarded by being given the privilege to choose a name for the &#x27;new&#x27; parish; either Barton or Eastly. She chose Eastly, but with a new modern spelling; Eastleigh. In 1891 the L&amp;SWR Carriage and Wagon Works from Nine Elms in London were transferred to Eastleigh. This was followed by the Nine Elms Locomotive Works which were moved there in 1909.
These railway works were closed in 2006 but have since reopened, albeit on a smaller scale.

Eastleigh has seen a rapid and controlled expansion in residential, industrial and commercial development over recent years. The borough of Eastleigh was ranked the &quot;9th best place to live in the UK 2006&quot; by a Channel 4 programme.
The United States Navy established a naval air station on 23 July 1918 to assemble and repair Caproni Ca.5 and Airco DH.4 and DH.9 bombers for the Northern Bombing Group of the First World War. The base closed shortly after the First Armistice at Compiègne. Perhaps Eastleigh&#x27;s best-known &#x27;resident&#x27; is the Spitfire aeroplane which was built in Southampton and first flown from Eastleigh Aerodrome. A replica has recently been placed on the roundabout at the entrance to the airport.

Eastleigh Museum, which is to be found in the High Street, holds information about the town and the surrounding villages, including Bishopstoke which had been the largest residential area.

== Education ==

Eastleigh has two further education colleges: Barton Peveril Sixth Form College (where Colin Firth was a pupil) and Eastleigh College (both on the same road). Crestwood Community School is the secondary school for the town, and primary schools include Cherbourg Primary School, Norwood Primary School, Nightingale Primary School, the Crescent Primary School and Shakespeare Infant and Junior Schools to the north of the town.

== Religion ==
The Anglican parish church is All Saints in Desborough Road. The Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Cross was built in Leigh Road in 1902 to replace an early tin church. Emmanuel Baptist Church was founded in the early 1930s, in the former Desborough Mission Hall in Desborough Road. The building dates to 1905.

Eastleigh Baptist Church is situated in Wells Place and was previously called Union Baptist Church. Adjacent to the main church building is the Wells Place Centre, built on the site of a former dairy which itself replaced a bacon factory.

St Andrew&#x27;s Methodist Church is located in Blenheim Road.

Junction Church has premises in Eastleigh&#x27;s High Street and Thrive Church meets at the Pavilion on the Park.

Eastleigh is represented in the House of Commons by Liberal Democrat MP Liz Jarvis. She was elected in 2024. 
The previous MP was Paul Holmes. He was first elected for the constituency at the 2019 general election with a majority of 9,147 votes, taking over from Mims Davies, the Conservative MP who took the seat in 2015. Mike Thornton of the Liberal Democrats was elected at the 2013 by-election with a majority of 1,771 votes following the resignation of Chris Huhne, in a by-election that was closely fought with UKIP coming in second and the Conservatives finishing in third place.

In 2005 Huhne had been elected as the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) for the Eastleigh constituency after the previous MP (David Chidgey, also Liberal Democrat) retired. Eastleigh has a tradition of close contests, and Huhne narrowly beat the Conservative candidate Conor Burns with the second lowest swing against the Liberal Democrats of any seat with a retiring MP (2.6%). David Chidgey had succeeded the Conservative MP Stephen Milligan following his high-profile death. Chris Huhne was appointed as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change following the 2010 general election. Huhne resigned the seat in February 2013 after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice over a 2003 speeding case.

The Swan Centre included a French-style café and a new library (replacing the former library situated in the Park, now used as part of The Point)

== Notable people ==

Famous people linked to Eastleigh include the painter Mary Beale, Chrystabel Leighton-Porter, the model for the Second World War cartoon character &quot;Jane&quot;, and Benny Hill who both lived in the town. Hill&#x27;s first job was at Woolworths on Leigh Road, Eastleigh. He then moved on to be a milkman for Hanns Dairies, on Factory Road, now Wells Place. His time working in Eastleigh on a horse-drawn milk float gave him his inspiration for his hit record, &quot;Ernie, The Fastest Milkman In The West&quot;. In Hill&#x27;s honour, a plaque has been put up close to the site of the now demolished Hanns Dairies building and a new road has been named &quot;Benny Hill Close&quot;, though many of the people who had bought the new homes were not happy with the decision. An alternative suggestion was Cowpat Lane.

Sir Arthur Young, the eminent chief of police, was born at 55 Chamberlayne Road in 1907. Sporting notables include Tommy Green who won an Olympic Gold Medal at the 1932 Los Angeles Games in the 50K walk, and Vince Hawkins who was British Middleweight Boxing Champion in the late 1940s.

<doc id="350399" wikidata="Q5243522" url="?curid=350399" title="Dayton Dragons">
<text>The Dayton Dragons are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. They are located in Dayton, Ohio, and play their home games at Day Air Ballpark. In 2011, they broke the record for most consecutive sellouts by a professional sports team, selling out their 815th consecutive game, breaking the record formerly held by the Portland Trail Blazers.

The Dragons came to Dayton in 2000 as the franchise was relocated from Rockford, Illinois. The franchise was previously known as the Rockford Expos (then Royals, Cubbies, and Reds). In 2021, the Dragons and 11 other teams that had previously competed in the Midwest League entered the High-A Central as Major League Baseball completed a large restructuring of Minor League Baseball. This was a temporary name change, with the historical &quot;Midwest League&quot; moniker returning for the 2022 season.

==Day Air Ballpark==
The team&#x27;s home park is Day Air Ballpark in Dayton, formerly (until 2020) known as Fifth Third Field. During its first season, the Dragons set a Minor League Baseball Class-A single-season attendance record of 581,853. The Dragons broke that record in 2003 and again in 2004. The Dragons broke the record again in 2010 with a season attendance total of 597,433, which still stands as the Class-A record.

The Dragons have averaged 8,258 fans per game over their 21-year history (through the 2021 season). They have led the Class-A level in attendance in all 24 years of their existence and have finished first among all teams below the Triple-A level for 18 straight seasons, from 2006 to 2019 and in 2021-24 (there was no season in 2020). In 2022, the Dragons&#x27; per-game average attendance of 7,935 was first among all 120 teams across Minor League Baseball.

On July 9, 2011, the Dragons officially set a new record of 815 consecutive sellout home games. The sellout streak is the longest across all professional sports in the US, passing the previous record set by the Portland Trail Blazers from 1977 to 1995. On May 10, 2014, the streak of consecutive sellouts reached 1,000 games. After announcing the sellout streak was in jeopardy at the beginning of the 2023 season, the streak reached 1,500 games on August 26, 2023. According to the official team website, every home game in the team&#x27;s first 20 years (prior to the canceled 2020 season) was a sellout. The streak (which was &quot;paused&quot; in 2020 due to the season being cancelled, and again in 2021 due to all minor league ballparks opening with reduced capacity due to COVID-19 restrictions) now stands at 1,573 consecutive sold-out home games (through the end of the 2024 season), an all-time record for sports in North America.

==Ownership==
In 2014, the founding ownership group, Peter Guber&#x27;s Mandalay Baseball Properties, sold the team to Palisades Arcadia Baseball LLC, led by Greg Rosenbaum, Nicholas Sakellariadis, and Michael Savit.

==Media==
Radio: All Dragons home and road games are broadcast on radio on 980 WONE, with Tom Nichols as the lead broadcaster. The broadcasts are also available via the internet at daytondragons.com and wone.com and on mobile devices via the Dragons mobile app. Dragons radio broadcasts moved to WONE starting with the 2011 season after Dragons games aired on WING 1410 AM from 2003 to 2010 and on WHIO 1290 AM from 2000 to 2002. Nichols has served as the Dragons Director of Broadcasting and lead play-by-play announcer since the 2008 season. Mike Vander Woude was the team&#x27;s primary broadcaster from 2000 to 2007. All home and road games have been broadcast throughout the Dragons history.

Television: The Dragons have televised 25 games per season since the 2011 season with Dragons Director of Broadcasting Tom Nichols serving as the lead announcer. In 2016, telecasts moved to WBDT (Dayton&#x27;s CW) as games appeared on an over-the-air network station for the first time in Dragons history. Since the 2016 season, WDTN sports director Jack Pohl has teamed with Nichols on Dragons television broadcasts. From 2001 to 2010, the Dragons television schedule included 15 games per season before the number of broadcasts was increased to 25 in 2011. The Dragons televised five games in their inaugural season of 2000. Dragons games were televised on WHIO-TV digital channel 7.2 (Time Warner Cable channels 23 and 372) from 2009 to 2015. Games were televised on Time Warner Cable from 2000 to 2008. Over the years, Dragons color commentators on television broadcasts have included Joe Nuxhall, Ken Griffey Sr., Tom Browning, Ron Oester, Bill Doran, Tommy Helms, Todd Benzinger, Doug Bair, Jeff Reboulet, and Hal McCoy, among others.

==Player milestones in Dayton Dragons history==

* Austin Kearns hit home runs in eight consecutive games from July 17–24, 2000.
* In 2002, Bobby Basham pitched three consecutive nine-inning complete game shutouts for the Dragons. Over 27 innings, he allowed just two walks with 34 strikeouts and surrendered only 11 hits.
* Donald Lutz became the first and only Dragons player to hit for the cycle on July 21, 2011, vs. the Peoria Chiefs. He did it in reverse order within the first five innings of the game (home run, triple, double, single).
* Billy Hamilton became the first player in the history of the Cincinnati Reds organization to compile at least 100 stolen bases in a season when he stole 103 in 2011.
* Seth Mejias-Brean hit an ultimate grand slam home run (game-ending home run with team trailing by three runs) to defeat Beloit on July 18, 2013. Mejias-Brean&#x27;s walk-off homer came with one out and the bases loaded in the bottom of the 9th, trailing 6–3.
* On May 20, 2017, three Dayton pitchers combined for the first nine-inning no-hitter in Dragons history. Scott Moss, Carlos Machorro, and Brian Hunter combined to no-hit the Bowling Green Hot Rods.
* On July 31, 2017, José Siri extended his hitting streak to 36 consecutive games to break the Midwest League record that had stood since 1977 (Tony Toups, Waterloo, 35). Siri&#x27;s streak eventually reached 39 straight games.

<doc id="350401" wikidata="Q5508982" url="?curid=350401" title="Fundamentals of Engineering exam">
<text>The Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, also referred to as the Engineer in Training (EIT) exam, and formerly in some states as the Engineering Intern (EI) exam, is the first of two examinations that engineers must pass in order to be licensed as a in the United States. The second exam is the Principles and Practice of Engineering exam. The FE exam is open to anyone with a degree in engineering or a related field, or currently enrolled in the last year of an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) accredited engineering degree program. Some state licensure boards permit students to take it prior to their final year, and numerous states allow those who have never attended an approved program to take the exam if they have a state-determined number of years of work experience in engineering. Some states allow those with ABET-accredited &quot;Engineering Technology&quot; or &quot;ETAC&quot; degrees to take the examination. The exam is administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES).

==History and structure==
In 1965, 30 states administered the first FE exam. The FE tests knowledge of what college graduates should have mastered during school. In 1966, a national uniform PE exam was offered. As of 2014, the FE and FS exams are offered only via Computer Based Testing (CBT). The exam consists of 110 questions and is given during a 6-hour session, of which 5 hours and 20 minutes is designated as time for answering the questions. The remaining time includes a tutorial, presented at the beginning of the session, and an optional 25-minute break. Examinees must apply to be tested in one of seven fields: chemical, civil, electrical and computer, environmental, industrial and systems, mechanical, and other disciplines. Each examinee is provided with an electronic copy of a reference handbook compiled by NCEES, the only reference that may be used during the exam.

Prior to 2014, the exam was divided into two 4-hour sessions with a lunch break in between. The morning session consisted of 120 questions in a range of scientific/engineering subjects and had to be taken by all examinees, while the afternoon session consisted of 60 questions and could be taken either in a specific discipline or as a general engineering test. The reference handbook was distributed as a hard copy; examinees were not allowed to bring their own copies and had to return the provided ones at the end of each session.

In 2015, content changes in the exam were instituted to make it discipline-specific, with a plan of weaving general engineering subject matter (e.g. math and science fundamentals) throughout the exam. Less of the &quot;full breadth&quot; of most traditional engineering undergraduate curricula will be captured with this approach - such as the broad math and science foundation spanning chemistry, physics, mechanics (i.e. statics and dynamics), materials science, computer science, electronics/circuits, engineering design, and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. calculus, differential equations, statistics). A concern was that, while most undergraduate engineering students are in fact exposed to most of these subjects, they may not necessarily take courses in specialized topics such as thermodynamics and fluid mechanics.

Since July 2020, the NCEES has made updates across all FE exam disciplines. For example, the topic &quot;Computational Tools&quot; was removed for the civil and mechanical disciplines. In other cases, topics and subtopics have been merged or combined. The NCEES also published an updated version of the tenth edition of the FE Reference Handbook. The handbook was revised incorporating a coherent single-page layout instead of a two-column layout, the addition and removal of a few new equations, and updated FE Exam Specifications. 

== License ==
Those who pass the exam are sometimes designated Engineer In Training or Engineer Intern depending on their state&#x27;s licensure board&#x27;s approach to recognizing those who are partway through the licensure process. Many engineering firms will judge an engineering job applicant based on whether they have passed the FE exam and registered as an EIT. Passing the FE Exam shows that an applicant has not forgotten the basic fundamental engineering principles they learned as an undergraduate student. After obtaining a given amount of work experience (the length of which is set by state law and may be based on the type of degree received), an EIT/EI may qualify to take the Professional Engineer (PE) exam. Actual licensure can then be applied for and awarded upon successful completion of the PE exam. The standard time of work experience (which may need to be under a Professional Engineer) is four years in most US states, for graduates of an ABET-accredited engineering program. 

== Passing rates ==
The NCEES posts passing rates biannually on their website with the following criteria:

* Took the FE exam for the first time
* Attended EAC/ABET-accredited engineering programs
* Took the FE exam within 12 months of graduation

The passing rate based on the criteria spans from 63 to 76 percent as of 2021. The organization also posts complete passing rates annually in their &quot;Squared: A Year In Numbers&quot; report, which includes all examinees. These reports have been available since 2014.

=== Passing scores ===
The exam results are based on the total number of correct answers with no reductions for wrong answers. A scaled score is converted from the original number of correct answers. Examinees take a unique exam generated from a volunteer-sourced NCEES problem bank. The organization does not publish the passing score because it varies slightly based on the difficulty of the exam. If an examinee does not pass an exam, the organization provides a diagnostic report to help them identify the knowledge areas they need to improve before retaking the exam.

==U.S. Patent Office==
Passage of the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam, along with graduation with any Bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent, satisfies the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)&#x27;s technical requirements for sitting for its registration examination to become either a registered patent attorney or patent agent.

<text>The Fort Wayne TinCaps are a Minor League Baseball team based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The TinCaps compete in the Midwest League as the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres. The team plays its home games at Parkview Field. The TinCaps won the Midwest League championship in 2009.

==History==
The Midwest League came to Fort Wayne in . The franchise is the oldest in the Midwest League and dates back to the league&#x27;s beginning as the Illinois State League, starting in in Mattoon, Illinois as the Mattoon Indians. In the team moved to Keokuk, Iowa, where it spent five seasons as the Keokuk Cardinals; it was then based in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin (–) and Kenosha, Wisconsin (–) before moving to Fort Wayne. The team was a Minnesota Twins farm team before they affiliated with the Padres in . When the team moved to Fort Wayne in 1993, it adopted a new name, the Wizards.

The name TinCaps was chosen following the 2008 season, alluding to John Chapman, better known as Johnny Appleseed (1774–1845). The Tin Cap refers to the story (dating back to the 19th century), that Johnny Appleseed wore a tin cooking pot as a hat, though this depiction has been disputed by historians. Chapman spent his final years in Fort Wayne and is buried in the city.

The team&#x27;s home park was Memorial Stadium, opened in 1993; a franchise attendance record of 318,506 was also set that year. As part of the Harrison Square revitalization project, Parkview Field became the official home of the TinCaps at the start of the 2009 season. To coincide with the new ballpark, the team held a contest to determine a new name for the Wizards once that new ballpark opened, and &quot;TinCaps&quot; was the result.

The mascot of the TinCaps is Johnny TinCap. Previously, for the Wizards, it was Dinger the Dragon and prior to that, the Wizards were represented by Wayne the Wizard.

The team won the Midwest League 2009 championship by sweeping the Burlington Bees, 3–0. The first two games were played at Parkview Field and the final, decisive game was played in Burlington, Iowa. The team and its staff were honored at Parkview Field in a special victory rally on September 18, 2009. In addition to winning a franchise record-setting 94 games in their new home, fans shattered the previous attendance record for the season, with 378,529 coming through the turnstiles.

The TinCaps also clinched playoff spots in every season of Parkview Field&#x27;s existence with the exception of 2016.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the TinCaps were organized into the High-A Central. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

<text>The Lansing Lugnuts are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Athletics. They are located in Lansing, Michigan, and play their home games at Jackson Field.

The Midwest League came to Lansing after owners Tom Dickson and Sherrie Myers moved the team to work with the city for a public-private lease to build a new stadium. Mayor David Hollister, and the City Council worked to attract the owners and build the stadium for downtown economic development. The team began playing in downtown Lansing in 1996. The franchise began as the Lafayette Red Sox in Lafayette, Indiana, in 1955; after two seasons it became the Waterloo Hawks, moving to Waterloo, Iowa, where it stayed for 36 seasons. Before the 1994 season it moved to Springfield, Illinois, but only spent two seasons there before moving to Lansing. The franchise was an affiliate of the Kansas City Royals on two occasions in three cities: as the Waterloo Royals from 1969 through 1976, as the Sultans of Springfield in 1995, and then, upon the team&#x27;s move to Lansing, from 1996 through 1998. The Lugnuts were then an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs from 1999 through 2004 before joining the Jays&#x27; farm system for the 2005 season. In September 2014, the Jays extended their agreement with the Lugnuts through the 2016 season. In October 2016, their player development contract was extended through the 2018 season. Since 2021, they have been be the High-A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics.

The Lugnuts&#x27; ballpark, Jackson Field, opened in 1996. The stadium seats over 10,000 fans and is one of the most handicapped accessible stadiums in the country. The franchise attendance record of 538,326 was set during its inaugural year. They won the Midwest League Championship in 1997 and 2003. The Lugnuts have their own original song which plays immediately after the national anthem for every home game accompanied by their mascot, Big Lug.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Lugnuts were organized into the High-A Central. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Crosstown Showdown==
Since 2007, the Lansing Lugnuts have participated in an annual exhibition game with nearby Michigan State University which draws a large crowd of students to the event. The overall record and attendance for each game is as follows:

<text>George Wallace Jones (April 12, 1804 – July 22, 1896) was an American frontiersman, entrepreneur, attorney, and judge, was among the first two United States Senators to represent the state of Iowa after it was admitted to the Union in 1846. A Democrat who was elected before the birth of the Republican Party, Jones served over ten years in the Senate, from December 7, 1848 to March 3, 1859. During the American Civil War, he was arrested by Federal authorities and briefly jailed on suspicion of having pro-Confederate sympathies.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Vincennes, Indiana. He was the son of John Rice Jones, who became active in efforts directed toward the introduction of slavery to the country north of the Ohio River. When George was six years old, his father moved the family to Missouri Territory, recently acquired from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase. As a child he served as a drummer for a volunteer company in the War of 1812. He later moved to Kentucky where he attended Transylvania University in 1825, and returned to Missouri to study law with his brother. After he was admitted to the bar and had practiced law for a short time, he went to work at Sinsinawa Mound, then in Michigan Territory, where he mined lead and worked and a storekeeper. He returned to Missouri, where he courted and married seventeen-year-old Josephine Gregiore in 1829. In 1831 Jones returned to Sinsinawa with his wife, seven slaves and several French laborers, to resume lead mining.

In 1832, Jones fought the Sauk and Fox Indians in the Black Hawk War, in which his brother-in-law Felix St. Vrain was killed. Jones was a judge in the local county court.

==Delegate to Congress from territories==
Jones was a delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives from both Michigan Territory and Wisconsin Territory. Uncertainty over precisely when his terms began and ended led to a contested election that was settled by the House, in favor of his opponent, in 1839.

=== Election and service as delegate ===
Jones was elected to represent Michigan Territory as its at-large delegate in the 24th Congress. Part of the territory was in the process of becoming the state of Michigan, and already had a &quot;de facto&quot; state government in place, so Jones helped push forward legislation to create a new Territory of Wisconsin comprising what remained of Michigan Territory. That legislation became law on April 20, 1836, and Wisconsin Territory came into existence on July 4 of that year.

An election was held in October 1836 to choose the new territory&#x27;s Congressional delegate, and Jones won. He took his seat at the opening of the next session of Congress on December 5, 1836, as the delegate from the Territory of Wisconsin. In that position he successfully persuaded voting members to support the designation of areas of Wisconsin Territory west of the Mississippi River as Iowa Territory. In February 1838, he served as second to Jonathan Cilley, a Congressman from Maine, in his duel with William J. Graves, a Congressman from Kentucky, in which Cilley was fatally wounded. The outpouring of anger over four Congressmen being involved in a fatal duel led to a House committee recommending censure for Jones and expulsion for Graves, but no such action was taken before the end of the session.

===Contested election===
In September 1838, Jones lost an election to James Duane Doty to serve as the Wisconsin Territory&#x27;s delegate to Congress. Jones went to Washington to take his seat for the session beginning that December, reasoning that his term through January 26, 1837, had been as the delegate from Michigan Territory, and thus he was entitled to a full two-year term beginning March 4, 1837, as the delegate from Wisconsin Territory. He believed Doty should not be seated until his own term expired on March 4, 1839. At the opening of the session, Isaac Crary of Michigan moved that Doty, also in attendance, be seated, and the matter was referred to the Committee on Elections. The committee determined that Michigan Territory had ceased to exist on June 15, 1836, and thus Jones had ceased to be its delegate at the same time, notwithstanding that Crary had not been seated as the new state of Michigan&#x27;s representative until January 27, 1837, the day after statehood was officially granted. The committee reported in favor of Doty on December 21, and on January 3, 1839, the full House voted to seat Doty. Joshua Giddings of Ohio attempted to deny Jones payment for his travel to Washington and the month of salary he had claimed, but the full House voted to honor his claim in spite of its determination that he was not entitled to the seat.

===Other territorial offices===

President Martin Van Buren appointed him as Surveyor-General of the Wisconsin and Iowa Territories, where he served (most likely in Dubuque, in Iowa Territory) from early 1840 until the end of the Van Buren administration in 1841. In 1845, following the election of another Democrat, James K. Polk, as president, he was reappointed Surveyor-General of Iowa Territory, one year before the southeastern eastern area of Iowa Territory became the State of Iowa.

==U.S. Senate==
Jones represented Iowa in the United States Senate from December 7, 1848 to March 3, 1859. For its first two years, the Iowa General Assembly failed to choose Iowa&#x27;s first U.S. Senators, due to a three-way split that prevented any candidate from earning the required number of 30 legislators&#x27; votes. However, after the 1848 elections gave the Democratic Party a greater share of Iowa legislators, Jones became a candidate for one of the two seats, and after four ballots won the Democratic caucuses&#x27; nomination for one of the two seats. He won the election and then, by drawing lots, received the seat with the longer term (to expire in four years). He won re-election (to a full six-year term) in 1852, after winning renomination by the Democratic Party by a single vote.

Jones was Chairman of the Committee on Engrossed Bills, the Committee on Pensions, and the Committee on Enrolled Bills. He served two terms before failing to be renominated. Jones had become increasingly unpopular in Iowa, even among those in his own party, because he often voted with southern Senators on slavery-related issues. As a senator, Jones was described by his biographer as a &quot;Democrat in politics and a southerner by instinct.&quot; He claimed to oppose slavery (despite his own slaveholding past) but insisted that Congress had no right to forbid it or criticize it where states chose to allow it. Thus, he supported the Kansas–Nebraska Act. That stance, while unremarkable at the time, ultimately rendered him incapable of re-election in a state whose antislavery, anticompromise faction became dominant midway in Jones&#x27; second term, as the new Republican Party. After his term ended, no Iowa Democrat would win election to the U.S. Senate until the 1920s. His ten years in the Senate were not matched by any Iowa Democrat until 1950, after Guy M. Gillette was elected a third time.

==Later life==
In 1858, the Democratic Party in Iowa, like those in other northern states, was bitterly divided over the support that its own president, James Buchanan, gave for the adoption by Kansas Territory and Congress of the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution. Jones had voted to approve the Lecompton Constitution in the Senate. When anti-slavery Iowa Democrats passed a resolution at their 1858 state convention repudiating the party&#x27;s previous support for the Lecompton Constitution, Jones and others in the party&#x27;s &quot;old guard&quot; walked out.

In 1859, President Buchanan appointed Jones as Minister Resident of the United States to New Granada (encompassing modern Colombia and Panama), requiring his relocation to Bogotá.

His service in Bogotá ended just as the Civil War broke out, as the Abraham Lincoln administration succeeded the Buchanan administration. Jones&#x27; two sons joined the Confederate Army. Upon returning to the United States in 1861, Jones was arrested by order of Secretary of State William H. Seward on the charge of disloyalty, based upon correspondence with his friend, Confederate President Jefferson Davis. He was never indicted or placed on trial. Jones was held for 34 days, until he was released by order of President Lincoln.

Jones then began a long retirement in Dubuque. In 1892, he was granted a pension by special act of Congress for his services in the Black Hawk War. On his ninetieth birthday in 1894, Governor Frank D. Jackson and the Iowa General Assembly gave Jones a public reception in recognition of his valuable services in the formative periods of the Territory and State. He died at his daughter&#x27;s home in Dubuque on July 22, 1896.

Jones County, Iowa and Jones County, South Dakota were named in his honor. In 1912, the State Historical Society of Iowa published the biography &quot;George Wallace Jones&quot;, by John Carl Parish.

In business, an affiliate is an entity that owns less than a majority stake in another&#x27;s stock. Affiliations can also describe a type of relationship in which at least two different companies are subsidiaries of a larger parent company. Most recently, affiliation has been a popular form of marketing for eCommerce companies.

== Corporate structure ==
A corporation may be referred to as an &quot;affiliate&quot; of another when it is related to it but not strictly controlled by it, as with a subsidiary relationship, or when it is desired to avoid the appearance of control. This is sometimes seen with companies that need to avoid restrictive laws (or negative public opinion) on foreign ownership.

== Affiliate marketings ==
The process where an organization will pay commission to an affiliate to promote their products either through a website, blog, email or social media. Affiliate marketing brings the power of network effects to brand outreach, using current customers and ambassadors as a channel for marketing outreach.

<doc id="350418" wikidata="Q2944958" url="?curid=350418" title="Wilko Johnson">
<text>John Andrew Wilkinson (12 July 1947 – 21 November 2022), better known by the stage name Wilko Johnson, was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter and occasional actor. He was a member of the pub rock/rhythm and blues band Dr. Feelgood in the 1970s. Johnson was known for his distinctive guitar playing style, which he achieved by not using a plectrum but playing fingerstyle. This enabled him to play rhythm guitar and riffs or solos at the same time creating a highly percussive guitar sound.

Johnson and Dr. Feelgood were an influence on the English punk movement. Paul Weller said of Johnson: &quot;Wilko may not be as famous as some other guitarists, but he&#x27;s right up there. And there are a lot of people who&#x27;ll say the same. I can hear Wilko in lots of places. It&#x27;s some legacy.&quot;

In 2011 and 2012 he appeared in the HBO fantasy series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, as the mute executioner Ser Ilyn Payne.

==Career==
===Music career===
Born on 12 July 1947 in Canvey Island, Essex, Johnson went to Westcliff High School for Boys and played in several local groups, before attending Newcastle University to study for a BA in English Language and Literature. His undergraduate courses included Anglo-Saxon and ancient Icelandic sagas.

After graduating, he travelled overland to India before returning to Essex to play with the Pigboy Charlie Band. The band evolved into Dr. Feelgood – a mainstay of the 1970s pub rock movement. After returning from Goa, he worked in 1972 as an English teacher. It was then that he adopted the stage name Wilko Johnson, a close anagram of John Wilkinson.

In 1965 Johnson bought his first Fender Telecaster guitar from a shop in Southend, Essex, for £90 (equivalent to £ in ). He later played a vintage 1962 Fender Telecaster with rosewood fingerboard which he bought in 1974, shortly after Dr. Feelgood signed their first record deal. 

Johnson developed his own image, coupling jerky movements on stage, his so-called &quot;duck walk&quot; (inherited from Chuck Berry), with a choppy guitar style, occasionally raising his guitar to his shoulder like a gun, and a novel dress sense: he favoured a black suit and a pudding bowl haircut. He achieved his playing style by not using a pick but instead relying on fingerstyle. This enabled him to play rhythm guitar and riffs or solos at the same time creating a highly percussive guitar sound. It evolved from a failed attempt to copy Mick Green of Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates, a guitarist whom Johnson greatly admired. His Bo Diddley-influenced style formed the essential driving force behind Dr. Feelgood during their initial years, including the band&#x27;s first four albums, &quot;Down by the Jetty&quot;, &quot;Malpractice&quot;, &quot;Stupidity,&quot; and &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Suspicion&quot;, all released between 1975 and 1977.

The live album, &quot;Stupidity&quot;, reached number one in the UK Albums Chart, but although Johnson played on Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s first five single releases, including &quot;Roxette&quot; and &quot;Back in the Night&quot;, the only single to chart during his membership of the band was &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Suspicion&quot;. He left the band in April 1977, following disagreements over the tracks to be included in the &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Suspicion&quot; album. The remaining band members claimed that Johnson had left voluntarily. But Johnson subsequently insisted: &quot;I didn&#x27;t leave, they threw me out and then told the newspapers that I&#x27;d left.&quot;

In 1977, he was a founding member of Solid Senders, with keyboardist John Potter, bassist Steve Lewins, and drummer Alan Platt. They signed to Virgin in 1978 and released the album, &quot;Solid Senders&quot; that year. The Wilko Johnson Band played at the &#x27;Front Row Festival&#x27;, a three-week event at the Hope and Anchor, Islington in late November and early December 1977, featuring many early punk rock acts. This resulted in the inclusion of two tracks by The Wilko Johnson Band (&quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; and &quot;Twenty Yards Behind&quot;), on a hit double album of recordings from the festival. The &quot;Hope &amp; Anchor Front Row Festival&quot; compilation album (March 1978) which reached number 28 in the UK Albums Chart.

In 1980, Johnson joined Ian Dury&#x27;s band, the Blockheads. Around 1984 he then re-formed The Wilko Johnson Band, joined by Blockhead bassist Norman Watt-Roy and Italian born drummer Salvatore Ramundo. &#x27;Sav&#x27; Ramundo left the band in June 1999 and was replaced by Steve Monti (future Curve and the Jesus and Mary Chain drummer). Johnson&#x27;s second album, &quot;Ice on the Motorway&quot;, was released in 1981, and his EP &quot;Bottle Up and Go!&quot; with Lew Lewis followed in 1983. Several albums were released on European labels over the next decade. In 1992, Johnson appeared at the Eurockéennes music festival, and the following year at GuilFest. The album &quot;Going Back Home&quot; appeared on the Chess label in 1998. He began to cut back on his concert appearances in 1999, and released the album &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Your Daddy Know (Live in Japan 2000)&quot; the following year.

The studio album &quot;Red Hot Rocking Blues&quot; was released in 2005; this contained covers of classics by the likes of Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Lead Belly. Throughout 2005 and 2006 the band teamed up with the Hamsters and John Otway to take part in &#x27;The Mad, the Bad &amp; the Dangerous&#x27; tour.
Johnson appeared in the Julien Temple-directed documentary film &quot;Oil City Confidential&quot; (2009), where he related his memories of Canvey Island and Dr. Feelgood. The reviewer Philip French described Johnson as &quot;a wild man, off stage and on, funny, eloquent and charismatic&quot;, while Temple described Johnson as &quot;an extraordinary man – one of the great English eccentrics&quot;. Reviewing the film for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw called it &quot;the best rockumentary yet&quot; and said that &quot;the most likeable thing about this very likeable film is the way it promotes Wilko Johnson as a 100–1 shot for the title of Greatest Living Englishman&quot;.

On 2 October 2010, it was announced that Johnson was to support the Stranglers on their &#x27;Black &amp; Blue&#x27; UK tour starting in March 2011. In April 2011, he played several sold-out shows as part of the Kilkenny Rhythm &amp; Roots Festival in Ireland.

Johnson published his autobiography, co-authored with Zoë Howe and titled &quot;Looking Back at Me&quot;, at the end of May 2012. He appeared in the BBC4 documentaries &quot;Evidently... John Cooper Clarke&quot; and &quot;Punk Britannia&quot; in May 2012. On 24 August 2012, Johnson and his band were due to headline the Blues stage at Rhythm Festival, but the festival was cancelled on 3 August due to poor ticket sales.

Johnson stated in early 2013 that he had terminal cancer, and announced he was going on a farewell tour. On 22 March 2013, he played what was announced as his final show guesting with Madness on the television programme &quot;Madness Live: Goodbye Television Centre&quot; which was broadcast on BBC Four. Afterwards he stated that he would not be able to perform his two final homecoming shows at Canvey Island due to ill health and would not be performing again.

However, on 13 July 2013, he performed an unannounced hour-long live set with Norman Watt-Roy and Dylan Howe at the Village Green Festival in his home town of Westcliff-on-Sea. In addition, he occasionally performed informal unannounced sets at his local pub, the Railway Hotel in Southend. In July 2013, the pub replaced their sign with a portrait of him painted by local artist Jack Melville, in honour of his long-term support of the south-east Essex music scene.

Johnson also played a set on the final night at Wickham Festival in Hampshire on Sunday 4 August 2013, where he was invited by the Blockheads on stage to play a song. Johnson announced a further tour with Howe and Watt-Roy during the spring of 2014.

In March and April 2014, Wilko, together with Watt-Roy and Howe, appeared on several UK dates as support to the &quot;Frantic Four&quot; (the classic line-up of Status Quo on what was billed as their last ever tour). In September 2014, after a meeting in Southend-on-Sea with Alan McGee, who described Wilko as &quot;one of his all time heroes, and a national treasure&quot;, Wilko signed to Creation Management. He performed &quot;All Through the City&quot; and &quot;Going Back Home&quot;, with his classic duckwalk, at Jools Holland&#x27;s annual &quot;Hootenanny&quot; for New Year, 2014–15.

====Later career, cancer and death====
Johnson was forced to cancel a show in November 2012 when he was rushed to hospital with an undisclosed ailment. He was diagnosed in January 2013 with late stage pancreatic cancer, and elected not to receive any chemotherapy.

On 25 January 2013, he gave an interview to John Wilson on the BBC Radio 4 arts programme &quot;Front Row&quot;. He discussed his cancer and said doctors had told him he had nine or ten months to live. He also talked about his &quot;farewell tour&quot; of the UK set for March and how his diagnosis had made him feel &quot;vividly alive&quot;. After the tour was over, he announced he would spend his final days recording a farewell album with The Who&#x27;s lead singer Roger Daltrey. The album, &quot;Going Back Home&quot;, was released in March 2014. &quot;I thought that was going to be the last thing I ever did&quot;, he later told BBC News entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson in October 2014. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;The album, rather shockingly, proved the most commercially successful recording for either collaborator in more than 30 years.&quot;

However, Johnson did not have the more common adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. It was later discovered that he had a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (PanNET), a less aggressive and more treatable form of the disease. Johnson underwent radical surgery to treat his illness, and the doctors were hopeful that his prognosis would be good. At the Q Awards on 22 October 2014, Johnson accepted the &quot;Icon Award&quot; and announced that he was &quot;cancer-free&quot; having undergone &quot;removal of his pancreas, spleen, part of his stomach, small and large intestines and the removal and reconstruction of blood vessels relating to the liver&quot;. Johnson said: &quot;It was an 11-hour operation… This tumour weighed 3kg – that&#x27;s the size of a baby! Anyway, they got it all. They cured me. It&#x27;s so weird and so strange that it&#x27;s kind of hard to come to terms with it in my mind. Now, I&#x27;m spending my time gradually coming to terms with the idea that my death is not imminent, that I am going to live on&quot;. He added that he was still recovering from the operation and when asked what he would do next replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t know really&quot;.

In 2015, Julien Temple released his second documentary about Johnson, &quot;The Ecstasy of Wilko Johnson&quot;, which featured Johnson’s tour of Japan and his album with Roger Daltrey. The film records Johnson’s successful medical treatment and coming to terms with the fact that he did not have terminal cancer. &quot;Variety&quot; reviewed the film: &quot;Julien Temple’s characteristically playful, pop-culture savvy approach to the documentary form might seem ill-suited to the subject of mortality, but veteran English axman Johnson’s unexpectedly buoyant response to very bad news makes for a film about saying goodbye that is itself void of grief, fear or regret.&quot;

In 2016 he received an Honorary Doctor of Arts award at Anglia Ruskin University in a ceremony at Cambridge Corn Exchange. 

Johnson died on 21 November 2022, at his home in Westcliff-on-Sea, at the age of 75. Following the announcement of Johnson&#x27;s death, Billy Bragg said, &quot;His guitar playing was angry and angular, but his presence – twitchy, confrontational, out of control – was something we&#x27;d never beheld before in UK pop. Rotten, Strummer and Weller learned a lot from his edgy demeanour.&quot; Alex Kapranos, lead singer of Franz Ferdinand said, &quot;His unique, wired playing &amp; stage presence thrilled &amp; inspired many guitarists, myself included.&quot; Broadcaster Bob Harris said &quot;Wilko was absolutely unique. His energy and spirit were incredible.&quot;

===Acting career===
For his acting debut, Johnson was cast in the role of mute executioner Ser Ilyn Payne, in both the first and second season of the HBO fantasy series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, from April 2011, after the producers had seen him in &quot;Oil City Confidential&quot;. He related that &quot;&#x27;They said they wanted somebody really sinister who went around looking daggers at people before killing them. That made it easy. Looking daggers at people is what I do all the time, it&#x27;s like second nature to me&#x27;.&quot; He appeared in four episodes. His character name was mentioned often in future episodes by Arya Stark as she recited her list of people she wanted to kill, because he was the executioner that beheaded her father, Ned Stark.

==Personal life==
Johnson lived in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. He married his childhood sweetheart Irene Knight when they were teenagers, and the couple had two sons, Matthew and Simon. Johnson was widowed in 2004 after his wife&#x27;s death from cancer. He was interested in astronomy, painting and poetry. Johnson&#x27;s son Simon is also a guitarist, playing in Southend-based band Eight Rounds Rapid.

He was involved in politics as a student at Newcastle University, and had been a member of the Young Communist League before university.

==Legacy==

Johnson&#x27;s musical style underpinned the early years of Dr. Feelgood. His style has been cited as one of the founding influences of the British punk movement. Jean-Jacques Burnel of The Stranglers says &quot;I often say to journalists there is a bridge between the old times and the punk times. That bridge is exclusively the Feelgoods, it allowed us to go from one thing to another. That&#x27;s the connection, the DNA.&quot; This influence was explored in the 2009 documentary about Dr. Feelgood, &quot;Oil City Confidential&quot;. Reviewing Johnson&#x27;s autobiography, Mark Blake of &quot;Q&quot; magazine said &quot;In the mid-70s the band&#x27;s brutish R&amp;B and their guitarist&#x27;s eye-popping thousand-yard stare inspired a young John Lydon, Paul Weller, and Suggs from Madness. &quot;Looking Back at Me&quot; secures the man born John Wilkinson&#x27;s reputation as one of British rock&#x27;s most unique characters. Wilko recalls his childhood on Canvey Island and how he followed the &#x27;60s hippy trail to Goa ... before helping invent punk with Dr Feelgood.&quot; The BBC4 three-part documentary series &quot;Punk Britannia&quot;, first aired in May 2012, also stressed the importance of Dr. Feelgood as &quot;pub rockers, a generation of bands sandwiched between 60s hippies and mid-70s punks who will help pave the way towards the short, sharp shock of punk&quot;.

In February 2017, The Wave Pictures released a vinyl EP titled &quot;Canvey Island Baby&quot;, which featured five covers of Johnson-penned tracks and an additional song, the title track written by the band&#x27;s singer/guitarist David Tattersall.

<text>The South Bend Cubs are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. They are located in South Bend, Indiana, and play their home games at Four Winds Field at Coveleski Stadium.

The team was originally known as the South Bend White Sox from 1988 to 1993 during their affiliation with the Chicago White Sox, a partnership that lasted until 1997. They were called the South Bend Silver Hawks from 1994 to 2014. From 1998 to 2014, they were affiliates of the Arizona Diamondbacks. They then became an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs and became the South Bend Cubs in 2015.

==History==

South Bend, Indiana, was awarded a Midwest League franchise in 1988. Originally affiliated with the Chicago White Sox and bearing the name of the parent club, the team was renamed in 1994. The name &quot;Silver Hawks&quot; was chosen as an homage to the once popular Studebaker Silver Hawk automobile, which was manufactured in South Bend.

Notable former players include Brandon Webb, and Justin Upton, the number 1 overall draft pick in 2005.

The team&#x27;s home park is Four Winds Field at Coveleski Stadium. The stadium was built in 1987 and named for Stanley Coveleski, the Hall of Fame pitcher who retired to South Bend after a career in major league baseball that included pitching three complete games to help the Cleveland Indians win the 1920 World Series. On September 5, 2013, the South Bend Silver Hawks announced an agreement with the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, owners of Four Winds Casinos, for naming rights to the field. The field is now known as Four Winds Field. As part of the agreement, a permanent bronze memorial bearing the name and likeness of Stanley Coveleski is located at the main entrance in his honor.

Despite playing through rumors of sale and relocation in the near future to Marion, Illinois, the Silver Hawks managed a championship season in 2005, beating the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers and winning the 2005 Midwest League Championship. The team also won league titles in 1989 and 1993.

Former Indiana Governor (and former South Bend Mayor) Joe Kernan formed an investment group to purchase the Silver Hawks in 2005. At the time, Kernan made it clear that a principal objective of the group was to keep the team from leaving South Bend.

===New ownership===
In November 2011, Andrew T. Berlin of Chicago, a limited partner of the Chicago Cubs and Chairman/CEO of Chicago-based Berlin Packaging and the new owner of the team, ensured his commitment to the city of South Bend by signing a 20-year cumulative lease agreement for the use of Coveleski Stadium. He then added a public commitment to the citizens of the region that he would invest $2.5 million of his own money to make upgrades to the city-owned stadium. This investment resulted in the construction of The Ivy at Berlin Place, a $22 million apartment complex consisting of 121 apartments overlooking the stadium&#x27;s left field, which opened in 2019.

===Chicago Cubs===
On September 18, 2014, the Silver Hawks and Chicago Cubs signed a four-year player-development contract through 2018. Team Owner Andrew Berlin said in a statement, &quot;Today is a turning point. I made a promise to the local community and government officials who welcomed me with open arms three years ago. I promised that I would return the team to its former glory days. And I promised that I&#x27;d do everything I could to bring people back to South Bend and prove that this is a wonderful place to invest in.&quot; As a result of the name change and new affiliation with the Cubs, team merchandise sales increased by upwards of 700% of their previous totals.

With the launch of the Marquee Sports Network, Marquee indicated that a package of the team&#x27;s games would be carried on the channel while seeking carriage in the South Bend area.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Cubs were organized into the High-A Central and remained a Chicago affiliate. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. The Cubs won their second Midwest League championship in three seasons (the 2020 season was not played due to the COVID-19 pandemic) over the Lake County Captains by winning back-to-back road games after losing the first game of the best-of-three series at home.

==Awards==
After setting attendance records during the 2015 season, the South Bend Cubs won the 42nd John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award as the minor league&#x27;s &quot;most complete franchise&quot;. The president of the team, Joe Hart, said, &quot;To be selected for this prestigious award over some of the best franchises across the nation is extremely humbling.&quot;

==Mascot==
The team has two mascots. One is Stu the Cub, who was selected following an online fan vote prior to Opening Day. The other is Swoop the Silver Hawk, who was the mascot when the team was known as the Silver Hawks, and was kept after the name change. Like the former Silver Hawks team name, Stu&#x27;s name derives from Studebaker, the defunct automobile manufacturer once based in South Bend.

On February 22, 2024, the Cubs announced that Swoop would be retired at the conclusion of the 2024 season, leaving Stu as the sole mascot.

<text>Torrevieja (; is a Mediterranean-seaside city and municipality on the Costa Blanca, in the province of Alicante, Valencian Community, in southeastern Spain. The city is in one of the only Spanish-speaking areas of the Valencian Community.
Torrevieja lies about 50 kilometres south of the city of Alicante and had a population of around 90.1k residents as of the 2011 census; the latest official estimate (2019) is 83.3k inhabitants. Torrevieja was originally a salt-mining and fishing village, as it is located between the Mediterranean Sea and two large pink salt lakes known as &quot;Las Salinas de Torrevieja&quot;.

==History==
Until the 1800s, Torrevieja was nothing more than random cottages and desolate dwellings near an ancient guard tower, which gave the town its name; &quot;torre&quot; &quot;vieja&quot; is Spanish for &#x27;old tower&#x27;. In 1803, Charles IV decided to relocate the salt-mine production and offices from La Mata to the town of Torrevieja itself, allowing for the construction of new buildings and homes there. However, in 1829, the town was totally levelled by an earthquake, but the salt basins were soon recovered and business resumed. 

In the 19th century, the salt was mainly shipped from the town by Swedish and Dutch merchant and cargo ships. At the time, there was only limited salt exportation to other regions of Spain, mainly to Galicia and, to a lesser extent, greater Valencia. Soon, with the turn of the 20th century, a quarter of all the salt sold in Spain was harvested directly from the Torrevieja lagoons, with the rest being exported to foreign markets. Today, it is still an important industry in Torrevieja and still a major employer. The city features a Museum of Sea and Salt.

In 1931, Alfonso XIII gave Torrevieja city status by special grant. During this period, there was also a growing market for locally-grown flax, hemp and cotton.

The municipality contains a water desalination plant, the largest of its kind in Europe. The company that built the plant, Acconia, maintains that the plant supplies water for customers across Northern Europe.

==Recent history==
Since the mid-20th century, and entering into the 21st century, the local economy has grown exponentially due to the Mediterranean tourism industry, attracting visitors from elsewhere in Spain as well as tourists from abroad. Additionally, there is a strong contingent of British, Irish, German and Scandinavian citizens who stay in Torrevieja year-round, as well as many extended-vacationers using companies like Air BnB, or property timeshares. There is also a growing number of Spaniards who own second homes in the city. 

In 2004, Torrevieja had the largest number of British expats of all the Spanish municipalities (approx. 7,180). The high number of British residents from
Yorkshire has led to Torrevieja being nicknamed &#x27;Costa del Yorkshire&#x27; by some, and paella can be had served in giant Yorkshire puddings in many of the city&#x27;s restaurants.

In 2001, the city was (along with Random House&#x27;s Spanish subsidiary, Plaza &amp; Janés) recognised with Spain&#x27;s second-most important annual literary award, the , and its poetry correlative, .

==Climate==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh), with dry, mild winters and hot, very dry summers. October is the wettest month.

==Population==
In 1991, the city had 25,000 residents, two decades later close to 100,000. The father of the expansion was Pedro Ángel Hernández Mateo, mayor between 1988 and 2011. In order to encourage growth, all the land was rezoned fit for building, save for the two lagoons, designated natural parks in 1989.

The INE (Spanish Census) of 2005 showed that the city had 84,838 residents, and the &quot;ajuntament&quot; (district council area) had 95,531 residents. By January 2008 this figure had reached 103,154 of whom only 47,870 were Valencian or Spanish. More than 7,000 of the Spanish residents were originally from Madrid and not for nothing is Torrevieja known as (the beach of Madrid). However, by the 2011 census, the population had reduced to 90,097 and the latest estimate (for the start of 2019) is 83,337.

The most prominent nationalities in 2012 were:
==Politics==
The city is a conservative stronghold, with the (PP) maintaining an absolute majority at the municipal elections of 2007, and 2011. PP however narrowly lost its absolute majority in 2015 to a coalition of five parties which designated Green candidate José Manuel Dolón García mayor.

==Transport==
Torrevieja&#x27;s main road link is the N-332 road linking Cartagena with Valencia hugging the Mediterranean coastline. There was once a branch line from the Alicante–Murcia railway serving Torrevieja; which closed in the late 1970s. There are plans to reopen this line.

<text>The West Michigan Whitecaps are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. They are located in Comstock Park, Michigan, a suburb of Grand Rapids, and play their home games at LMCU Ballpark.

==Franchise history==
The Midwest League came to the Grand Rapids area in 1994 upon the arrival of the former Madison Muskies. The Whitecaps were brought to West Michigan by local businessmen Lew Chamberlin and Dennis Baxter. The Whitecaps were affiliated with the Oakland Athletics before they joined the Tigers&#x27; farm system in 1997.

Their home ballpark is LMCU Ballpark in Comstock Park. Before the 2002 season it was known as Old Kent Park; the name was changed when the park&#x27;s title sponsor, Old Kent Bank, was purchased by Fifth Third Bank. Before the 2021 season, the Lake Michigan Credit Union renamed the venue &quot;LMCU Ballpark&quot;. The team&#x27;s official mascots are Crash the River Rascal, Roxy the River Rascal and Franky the Swimming Pig.

The franchise&#x27;s attendance record of 547,401 was set in 1996.

Several league and team records were set during the 2006 season. The team posted the second best record in franchise history, going 89–48, including going 23–6 in July. Michael Hollimon hit 3 home runs in one game. Cameron Maybin hit 2 grand slams in the season. Michael Hernandez became the first person in the history of the Midwest League to hit for the cycle twice. The Whitecaps went on to defeat the Kane County Cougars in four games to win their fourth Midwest League Championship.

In 2009, the team drew the attention of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine after a , 4,800-calorie hamburger called the Fifth Third Burger was placed on the menu of the team&#x27;s concession stand. It was so named in part for the ballpark sponsor and part for its 1.6666 (or 5/3) pounds of meat. The Committee requested that the team put a label on the burger indicating that it was a &quot;dietary disaster&quot;. To date, more than 100 fans, or about a half of the people who have attempted the challenge, have conquered the burger and earned a commemorative T-shirt. On July 15, 2009, Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Man v. Food&quot; and its host Adam Richman came to Fifth Third Ballpark to attempt to conquer the burger in an episode of the popular show. The episode aired on September 30, 2009, wherein he successfully met the challenge. In 2012, The Whitecaps installed a new scoreboard and high resolution video display screen which was installed by TS Sports out of Dallas, Texas.

On January 3, 2014, a fire started in one of the suites. It spread and caused extensive damage, close to one half of the suites and 1st base concourse were destroyed. Thanks to extensive work, the park was restored and up and running by opening day.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Whitecaps were organized into the High-A Central. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Regular season==
== Postseason ==
The Whitecaps won the best-of-five Midwest League championship six times in six opportunities. They defeated the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers in 1996, the Rockford Cubbies in 1998, the Kane County Cougars twice (2004 and 2006), the Beloit Snappers in 2007, and the Cedar Rapids Kernels in 2015. West Michigan is 55–32 all-time in playoff games.

<doc id="350433" wikidata="Q1458685" url="?curid=350433" title="Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet (2 May 1746 in Bernay, Eure – 17 February 1825) was a French politician of the Revolutionary period. His brother, Robert Thomas Lindet, became a constitutional bishop and member of the National Convention. Although his role may not have been spectacular, Jean-Baptiste Lindet came to be the embodiment of the growing middle class that came to dominate French politics during the Revolution.
==Early career==
Born at Bernay (Eure), he worked in the town as a lawyer before the Revolution. He acted as &quot;procureur-syndic&quot; of the district of Bernay during the session of the National Constituent Assembly. Appointed deputy to the Legislative Assembly and subsequently to the Convention, he became well-known.

Initially close to the Girondists, Lindet was very hostile to King Louis XVI, provided a &quot;Rapport sur les crimes imputés à Louis Capet&quot; (20 December 1792) – a report of the king&#x27;s alleged crimes – and voted for the king&#x27;s execution without appeal.

He was instrumental in the establishment of the Revolutionary Tribunal, and contributed to the downfall of the Girondists. His proposal for the Tribunal had passed with support from Georges Danton, despite the opposition of Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud.

==&quot;Rapport sur les crimes imputés à Louis Capet&quot;==
Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet, being a member of the Commission of Twenty-one, had an instrumental role in the execution of Louis XVI and drew up the accusation in the &quot;acte enonciatif&quot;. He worked incessantly on the project, and became sleep-deprived to the point of exhaustion and was forced to take to his bed. At the time of trial, Lindet was to have Charles Barbaroux read the document, due to his fatigue.

Lindet wrote his accusation as a chronological retelling of the treasonous acts of the King, beginning in May 1789 and spanning until 10 August 1792. Beginning with the eve of the calling of the Estates-General, Lindet argued that Louis XVI intended to use the representatives to raise money for the bankrupt crown, and then send them on their way with few reforms. When this did not prove effective, Louis XVI resorted to the use of military force, which catalyzed the storming of the Bastille, and the movement of the King to Paris. From this point, he focused on the counter-revolutionary actions of the King as showcased by the discovery of the Armoire de fer (Iron Cupboard), proving that the king was duplicitous. By the summer of 1792, Lindet argued that Louis XVI had realized his counter-revolutionary efforts had proved futile, and he would have to take military action. He provoked the insurrection of 10 August, with the gathering of troops at the Tuileries, and when he saw his imminent defeat the Swiss were left to die for an undeserving king. Lindet would be known to have a strong opinion in this matter because during the Insurrection, he actually worked to help a Swiss guard escape. In his accusation against the king, Lindet focused strongly on his duplicity and betrayal against the actions of the French Revolution. His &quot;acte enonciatif&quot; characterized the views of the Montagnards, and also violated the Criminal Code of 1791. Another inconsistency in the trial of Louis XVI was that the argument presented against him by Lindet disregarded any account of the Revolutionary violence against the King, thus presenting his accusation as a series of inexcusable crimes against the Revolution.

==Committee and Terror==

He became a substitute member of the Committee of Public Safety on 6 April 1793, and soon replaced the ill Jean Antoine Debry. All members of the Committee of Public Safety belonged to bourgeoisie of the &quot;ancien regime&quot;, were Montagnards, and all had ample experience serving apprenticeships in previous years assemblies or in high offices of state. Lindet was unique in the demographics of the Committee of Public Safety, in that he was forty-six, where the average age of the members was thirty.

Very concerned by the question of food supplies, he showed his administrative talent in coping with the issue. Lindet was the department head, or the &quot;examiner&quot; of the National Food Commission. The National Food Commission was mainly in charge of economic measures and more specifically was responsible for the provision of subsistence, clothing, and transportation. This body consisted of over 500 members at the height of the Reign of Terror, and would often send these members out for tasks and the gathering of intelligence. For one of these missions, Lindet was sent to the districts of Rhône, Eure, Calvados and Finistère, for the purpose of suppressing revolts. He was successful and was able to enact a conciliatory policy. The National Food Commission also functioned to supervise agricultural and industrial production, was given control of the labor force for war effort, put in charge of controlling trade, and most importantly, the enforcement of the Law of Maximum.

Without being formally opposed to Maximilien Robespierre, he did not support him, and he was, with Philippe Rühl, one of the only two members of the Committee who did not sign the order for the execution of Danton and his party. When asked to do so, he had replied to Louis de Saint-Just: &quot;I am here to protect citizens, and not to murder patriots&quot;.

==Thermidor and Directory==
He also opposed the Thermidorian Reaction of July 1794, and defended Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac, Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne, and Collot d&#x27;Herbois from the accusations made against them on 22 March 1795. Himself denounced on 20 May, Lindet was defended by his brother Thomas, but only escaped condemnation by the vote of amnesty of the 4 Brumaire, year IV (26 October 1795).

The French Directory offered Lindet the opportunity to become its spy in Basel, but he turned down the mission. After taking part in the Conspiracy of Equals in 1796, he faced trial and was acquitted. He then was elected to the Council of Five Hundred (by Eure and Seine), but was not allowed to occupy his seat. However, he served as Minister of Finance from 18 June to 9 November 1799.

==Later life==
After Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against the Directory, the &quot;18 Brumaire&quot; of 1799, he refused to occupy offices of the Consulate (and consequently of the Empire).

In 1816 he was proscribed by the Bourbon Restoration government as a &quot;regicide&quot;, avoiding a harsher penalty by not having recognized Napoleon during the Hundred Days. Lindet returned to France some time before his death in Paris.

<text>A commercium (plural commercia) is a traditional academic feast known at universities in most Central and Northern European countries. In German it is called a or . Today it is still organised by student fraternities in Germanic and Baltic countries, as well as Poland.

At a commercium, tables are often placed in the form of a U or a W, and the participants drink beer and sing commercium songs. There are strict and traditional rules that govern this occasion but it may also integrate theatrical and musical aspects. A commercium is the more formal form of the tableround, called in German.

The term is derived from the French and had been used for any sort of noisy event. A Commers gathering consists of speeches, toasts and songs, sometimes arranged pranks as well. The drink of preference is beer. The arrangements are governed by officials () elected by the members of the Studentenverbindung. The sort of event started to be more formalized after 1871. German associations like firefighters or Schützenvereine started to arrange commercia in the 19th century and still do on special occasions.

Some special customs include a salamander or . The guests rise and having emptied their glasses hammer three times on the table with them. On the death of a student, his memory may be honored with a . The operetta &quot;The Student Prince&quot; made German students&#x27; drinking habits famous during the prohibition, and the rousing chorus of &quot;Drink! Drink! Drink!&quot; was especially popular with US theatergoers in 1924. In the last years of communist Eastern Germany, some students managed to arrange for new founded fraternities, e.g. Salana Jenensis in Jena and organized commercia on the Rudelsburg.

<text>Ashbourne is a market town in the Derbyshire Dales district in Derbyshire, England. Its population was measured at 8,377 in the 2011 census and was estimated to have grown to 9,163 by 2019. It has many historical buildings and independent shops. The town offers a historic annual Shrovetide football match. Its position near the southern edge of the Peak District makes it the closest town to Dovedale, to which Ashbourne is sometimes referred to as the gateway. 

The town is west of Derby, south-east of Buxton, east of Stoke-on-Trent, south-south-east of Manchester, south-west of Sheffield and north of Lichfield. Nearby towns include Matlock, Uttoxeter, Leek, Cheadle and Bakewell.

==History==
The town&#x27;s name derives from the Old English &quot;æsc-burna&quot; meaning &quot;stream with ash trees&quot;.

Ashbourne was granted a market charter in 1257. In medieval times it was a frequent rest stop for pilgrims walking &quot;St Non&#x27;s Way&quot; to the shrine of Saint Fremund at Dunstable in Bedfordshire.

The forces of Charles Edward Stuart passed through Ashbourne during the Jacobite rising of 1745.

==Governance==
Ashbourne Town Council has four wards – Belle Vue, Hilltop, Parkside and St Oswald&#x27;s – represented by a total of 13 councillors. It meets at Ashbourne Town Hall in the Market Place.

==Geography==
Ashbourne lies at . Ashbourne Green and Sturston are hamlets close by. Henmore Brook, a tributary of the River Dove, flows through the middle of the town. It has an elevation of .

==Economy==
From 1910, Nestlé had a creamery in the town which, for a period, was contracted to produce Carnation condensed milk. The factory had its own private sidings connected to the railway station goods yard, which allowed milk trains to access the facility and distribute product as far south as London. After milk trains ceased in 1965, the railway track was lifted as passenger services and the railway station had already been closed back in 1954. The factory closed in 2003 and, since demolition in 2006, has been redeveloped as housing and a light industrial estate, although the old loading ramp from street level up to the factory floor is still in place.

Water from a borehole on the site was first marketed as Ashbourne Water in 1975 and was sold mostly to the catering trade. Nestlé retained the borehole after the factory shut, taking water by tanker to Buxton for bottling. Declining sales (1.3 million bottles in 2005, compared to 90 million for Buxton water) meant it could not justify further investment and the brand was discontinued in 2006.

Tourism is an important element of the local economy, due to the town&#x27;s proximity to Dovedale and the Peak District. The Tourist Information Centre was closed in 2011 but, from January 2018, a visitor information centre was made available again in the town hall.

==Culture and community==

The cobbled market place hosts a traditional outdoor market every Thursday and Saturday throughout the year, complementing the wide range of individual shops in the town. Although its market heritage is important, it came under threat of closure from Derbyshire County Council in November 2012. The people of Ashbourne opposed any such moves by the council and started an online petition. Ashbourne became the 97th Fairtrade Town in March 2005 after many businesses, cafes, shops and community organisations started supporting Fairtrade.

===Ashbourne Shire Horse Society and Show===
According to the Ashbourne Show website:
==Media==
Local news and television channels are BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter.

Ashbourne&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby on 104.5 FM, Smooth East Midlands on 106.6 FM, Capital Midlands on 102.8 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Midlands on 96.7 FM (formerly Ashbourne Radio).

The &quot;Ashbourne News Telegraph&quot; is the town’s weekly local newspaper.

==Landmarks==

Ashbourne currently has eleven public houses and two social clubs. The most famous, the Green Man &amp; Black&#x27;s Head Royal Hotel, closed in 2011 and underwent a change of ownership in 2013, before reopening in 2018. The rare gallows sign across St John&#x27;s Street remains a meeting point in the town. In June 2020, the caricature of a black man&#x27;s head atop the sign became the focus of racial debate. It was removed after a petition had gathered more than 40,000 signatures, but it is being preserved locally.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Ashbourne railway station once served the town on the Ashbourne to Buxton railway line; the line was closed to regular passenger traffic in 1954. 

Today, the nearest railway stations are Uttoxeter, 12 miles away on the Crewe-Derby Line, and Derby, 13 miles away on the Midland Main Line. 

====History====
Construction of the Ashbourne to Buxton line began in 1896. Passenger services started to Buxton in August 1899, after the building of a joint railway station to serve the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) lines. It closed to regular passenger traffic in 1954; all services on the Ashbourne–Parsley Hay section ceased in 1963. The line continued down the Dove to Rocester, near Uttoxeter, where it joined the main North Staffordshire Railway. This southern link had opened in 1852 and, in 1867, the LNWR gained running powers over the line. It also closed to passengers in 1954 and completely in the early 1960s.

The course of the Ashbourne to Buxton line up to Parsley Hay has since been converted to the Tissington Trail, a popular recreational walking and cycle path.

===Buses===
Bus services in the area are provided by High Peak Buses and TrentBarton. There is an hourly service between Derby and Uttoxeter that stops in Ashbourne; other routes connect the town with Matlock, Leek, Buxton, Nottingham, Wirksworth and Burton.

==Recreation==
The Tissington Trail begins in the town. The path starts at Mappleton Lane on the northern outskirts of the town, accessed by a Victorian tunnel at the end of the leisure centre car park, which was formerly railway sidings. It follows the course of the former railway through the village of Tissington and joins the High Peak Trail (the old Cromford and High Peak Railway) at Parsley Hay.

The Limestone Way passes 2–3 miles away, through Tissington, Thorpe, Marten Hill and above Mayfield to Rocester. There are several routes for walkers from Ashbourne to Limestone Way.

==Education==
The main secondary school is Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School, founded in 1585. It moved to its current site on the Green Road in 1909 and took over Ashbourne County Secondary School in 1973.

==Religious sites==
The spire of St Oswald&#x27;s Church overlooks the town. The church is Early English in style and was built around 1220. There are a few remnants of earlier Norman construction and the south aisle has part of a Saxon cross shaft.

The church of St John was built on Buxton Road in 1871 in a neo-Norman style. Ashbourne Churches Together (ACT) has a link with the Diocese of Patna in the ecumenical Church of North India. Regular reciprocal visits take place. Members of ACT are currently sponsoring the education of children in a school in Bihar, one of the poorest states in India.

==Sport==
In the annual two-day Royal Shrovetide Football Match, one half of the town plays the other, using the town as the pitch, with goals three miles apart. As many as several thousand players compete for two days with a hand-painted, cork-filled ball. The game is played by two teams, the Up&#x27;ards and the Down&#x27;ards, over two eight-hour periods, subject to a few rules. Shrovetide football has been played for several centuries. It is a moving mass (the Hug) that continues through the roads of the town, across fields, and even along the bed of the local Henmore Brook. There were intermittent unsuccessful attempts to ban the game until the late 19th century.

Before the 1966 Football World Cup, the West German squad stayed at the nearby Peveril of the Peak Hotel and trained on one of Ashbourne&#x27;s town football pitches near the park.

Local contestant Dave Mellor was the 1978 BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars World Champion.

<text>Giuseppe Antonio Giachimo Cerutti (13 June 1738 – 3 February 1792) was a French-Italian author and politician.
==Life==

Cerutti was born in Turin. Having joined the Society of Jesus, he became a professor at the Jesuit college at Lyon. In 1762, in reply to the attacks on his order, he published an &quot;Apologie générale de l&#x27;institut et de la doctrine des Jésuites&quot;, which won him much fame and some exalted patronage; notably that of the ex-king Stanislaus of Poland and of his grandson the Dauphin.

During the agitations that preceded the French Revolution Cerutti took the popular side, and in 1788 published a pamphlet, &quot;Mémoire pour le peuple français&quot;, in which in a clear and trenchant style he advocated the claims of the &quot;tiers état&quot; (third estate). In May 1789 he presided over the electors of Paris, by whom in January 1791 he was chosen member of the administration of the department and afterwards deputy to the Legislative Assembly. He was a friend of Honoré Mirabeau, whose policy he supported and whose funeral oration he gave.

==&quot;La Feuille villageoise&quot;==

Probably the largest of Cerutti&#x27;s literary enterprises was the newspaper &quot;La Feuille villageoise&quot; founded by him, on 30 September 1790, in collaboration with Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Etienne and Philippe-Antoine Grouvelle.

&quot;La Feuille villageoise&quot; was a highly successful newspaper during the French Revolution. It is unusual among revolutionary journals for having been targeted not at Paris or another large city, but to rural audiences. The paper was extremely influential in much of the French countryside and had approximately 15,000 subscribers in 1791. It was continued by Grouvelle after Cerutti’s death.

Actual news reporting played only a minor part in the newspaper&#x27;s writings: political commentary was by far the primary content. &quot;La Feuille villageoise&quot; was thoroughly partisan in its republican favouritism, and unambiguous in its didactic presentation of its opinions. Less vitriolic and more analytical than many of its more infamous contemporary newspapers, &quot;La Feuille villageoise&quot; also distinguished itself by rarely identifying individual politicians as enemies of its ideas, but instead relied on a simple trope of &quot;aristocrates&quot; and &quot;patriotes&quot;.

<text>Commercium songs are traditional academic songs that are sung during academic feasts: commercia and tablerounds.

Some very old commercium songs are in Latin, like &quot;Meum est propositum&quot; or &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot;. 

In some countries, hundreds of commercium songs are compiled in commercium books.

<doc id="350452" wikidata="Q984613" url="?curid=350452" title="Kettering">
<text>Kettering is a market and industrial town as well as a civil parish in the North Northamptonshire district, in the ceremonial county of Northamptonshire, England. It is west of Cambridge, southwest of Peterborough, southeast of Leicester and north-east of Northampton. It is west of the River Ise, a tributary of the River Nene. The name means &quot;the place (or territory) of Ketter&#x27;s people (or kinsfolk)&quot;.

At the 2021 census Kettering had a population of 63,150. It is part of the East Midlands, along with the rest of Northamptonshire. There is a growing commuter population as it is on the Midland Main Line railway, with East Midlands Railway services direct to London St Pancras International taking about an hour.

==Early history==
Kettering means &quot;the place (or territory) of Ketter&#x27;s people (or kinsfolk)&quot;. Spelt variously Cytringan, Kyteringas and Keteiringan in the 10th century, although the origin of the name appears to have baffled place-name scholars in the 1930s, words and place-names ending with &quot;-ing&quot; usually derive from the Anglo-Saxon or Old English suffix &quot;-inga&quot; or &quot;-ingas&quot;, meaning &quot;the people of the&quot; or &quot;tribe&quot;.

Before the Romans, the area, like much of Northamptonshire&#x27;s prehistoric countryside, appears to have remained somewhat intractable with regards to early human occupation, resulting in an apparently sparse population and relatively few finds from the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. About 700 BC the use of iron spread into the area from the continent Between then and about 300BC two alignments of hill forts appear to have been constructed .with roughly even spacing between each fort on each chain. One of the alignments was along the north western side of the county with one of them possibly at Desborough. Iron age finds have been discovered there including the Desborough Mirror but the existence of that fort cannot be proved because the probable site has been quarried away. The other alignment was along the Nene Valley, roughly parallel to the first. One of these forts was at Irthlingborough and it was discovered 1n 1984. An archaeological investigation there found early iron age pottery and showed that a wooden structure there with a stockade was burnt down at some stage.

===Roman===
Like most of what later became Northamptonshire, from late in the 1st century BC the Kettering area became part of the territory of the Catuvellauni, a Belgic tribe, the Northamptonshire area forming their most northerly possession. The Catuvellauni were in turn conquered by the Romans in AD 43.

The town traces its origins to an early, unwalled Romano-British settlement, the remnants of which lie under the northern part of the modern town. Occupied until the 4th century, there is evidence that a substantial amount of iron smelting took place on the site. Along with the Forest of Dean and the Weald of Kent and Sussex, this area of Northamptonshire &quot;was one of the three great centres of iron-working in Roman Britain&quot;. The settlement reached as far as the Weekley and Geddington parishes. However, it is felt unlikely that the site was continuously occupied from the Romano-British into the Anglo-Saxon era. Excavations have revealed that the site at Weekly had been used for agriculture during the later iron age and a fortified enclosure had been constructed during the first century BC. During the first century AD lime kilns and kilns for making pottery were constructed. The site appears to have been occupied until about a hundred and fifty years after the Roman conquest. That would be until about 190 to 200 AD. Pottery kilns have also been unearthed at nearby Barton Seagrave and Boughton.

===Saxon===
Excavations in the early 20th century either side of Stamford road (A43), near the site of the former Prime Cut factory (now the Warren public house), revealed an extensive early Saxon burial site, consisting of at least a hundred cremation urns dating to the 5th century AD. This suggests that it may have been among the earliest Anglo-Saxon penetrations into the interior of what later became England. The prefix &quot;Wic-&quot; of the nearby village of Weekley may also signify Anglo-Saxon activities in the area; Greenall reports that it could be &quot;an indication of foederati, Anglo-Saxon mercenaries brought in to boost the defences of the Empire.&quot; This was established imperial policy, which the Romano-British continued after Rome withdrew from Britain around 410, with disastrous consequences for the Romano-Britons.

By the 7th century the lands that would eventually become Northamptonshire formed part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia. The Mercians converted to Christianity in 654 with the death of the pagan king Penda. From about 889 the Kettering area, along with much of Northamptonshire (and at one point almost all of England except for Athelney marsh in Somerset), was conquered by the Danes and became part of the Danelaw, with the ancient trackway of Watling Street serving as the border, until being recaptured by the English under the Wessex king Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, in 917. Northamptonshire was conquered again in 940, this time by the Vikings of York, who devastated the area, only for the county to be retaken by the English in 942.

It is unlikely, however, that Kettering itself existed as a village earlier than the 10th century (the county of Northampton itself is not referenced in documents before 1011). Before this time the Kettering area was most likely populated by a thin scattering of family farmsteads. The first historical reference of Kettering is in a charter of 956 in which King Edwy granted ten &quot;cassati&quot; of land to Ælfsige the Goldsmith. The boundaries delineated in this charter would have been recognisable to most inhabitants for the last thousand years and can still be walked today. It is possible that Ælfsige gave Kettering to the monastery of Peterborough, as King Edgar in a charter dated 972 confirmed it to that monastery.

===Medieval===
At the Domesday survey in 1086, Kettering manor is listed as held by the Abbey of Peterborough, the church owning 10 hides of land. Kettering was valued at £11, with land for 16 ploughs. There were 107 acres of meadow, 3 of woodland, 2 mills, 31 villans with 10 ploughs and 1 female slave.

The nearby stately home of Boughton House, sometimes described as the &#x27;English Versailles&#x27;, has for centuries been the seat of the Dukes of Buccleuch, major landowners in Kettering and most of the surrounding villages; along with the Watsons of Rockingham Castle, the two families were joint lords of the manor of Kettering.

Kettering is dominated by the crocketed spire of about of the Parish church of SS Peter and Paul. Little is known of the origins of the church, its first known priest becoming rector in 1219–20. The chancel is in the Early Decorated style of about 1300, the main fabric of the building being mostly Perpendicular, having been rebuilt in the mid 15th century (its tower and spire being remarkably similar to the tower and spire of St Peter&#x27;s Oundle). Whether the current building replaced an earlier church on the site is unknown. Two medieval wall paintings, one of two angels with feathered wings, and one of a now faded saint, can still be seen inside the church.

The charter for Kettering&#x27;s market was granted to the Bishop of Peterborough by Henry III in 1227.

===17th century===
In June 1607 at the nearby village of Newton, the Newton Rebellion broke out, causing a brief uprising known as the Midland Revolt, which involved several nearby villages. Protesting at land enclosures at Newton and Pytchley by local landlords the Treshams, on 8 June a pitched battle took place between Levellers – many from Kettering, Corby and particularly Weldon, – and local gentry and their servants (local militias having refused the call to arms). Approximately 40–50 local men are said to have been killed and the ringleaders hanged, drawn and quartered. The Newton rebellion represents one of the last times that the English peasantry and the gentry were in open conflict.

By the 17th century the town was a centre for woollen cloth.

==Recent history (from 19th century to present day) ==
The present town grew in the 19th century with the development of the boot and shoe industry, for which Northamptonshire as a whole became famous. Many large homes in both the Headlands and Rockingham Road were built for factory owners, while terraced streets provided accommodation for the workers. The industry has markedly declined since the 1970s, large footwear-manufacturers such as Dolcis, Freeman, Hardy and Willis, Frank Wright and Timpsons, having left the town or closed down in the face of stiff overseas competition, while others have outsourced their production to lower-cost countries. Only two smaller footwear-businesses remain.

William Carey, born in 1761 at Paulerspury, spent his early life in Kettering before leaving for India as a missionary in 1793. Carey Mission House and Carey Street were named after him. Andrew Fuller helped Carey found the Baptist Missionary Society and he is remembered in the Fuller Church and Fuller Street. In 1803 William Knibb was born in Market Street and became a missionary and emancipator of slaves; he is commemorated by the Knibb Centre and Knibb Street. Toller Chapel and Toller Place take their names from two ministers, father and son, who preached in Kettering for a total of 100 years. The chapel was built in 1723 for those who since 1662 had been worshipping in secret.

Politics in Kettering has not always been a sedate affair: in 1835, a horrified Charles Dickens, then a young reporter for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;, watched aghast as a Tory supporter on horseback, intent (along with others) on taking control of by-election proceedings, produced a loaded pistol and had to be restrained by his friends from committing murder. The ensuing riot between Tory and Whig supporters led Dickens in his article to form various opinions of Kettering and its voters, none of them complimentary.

After several false starts the Midland Railway opened Kettering railway station in 1857, providing a welcome economic stimulus to an ailing local economy, suffering as it was from the loss of wayfaring business since the introduction of railways nationwide. The line in 1857 ran through Kettering from Leicester to Hitchin, where it joined the Great Northern Railway. Trains ran from there into London King&#x27;s Cross. The line was finally linked to London directly in 1868 when the Midland opened its own line from Bedford to London St Pancras.

John Bartholomew&#x27;s 1887 &quot;Gazetteer of the British Isles&quot; described Kettering as:

Iron-ore quarrying began in the Kettering area, probably for the first time since Roman times, at Glendon to the north of the town in 1863. At that place the digging of a railway cutting had exposed the ore beds. Quarrying began a little north of what later became Glendon Junction on the west side of the main railway. The Glendon quarries continued in operation until 1980. The last ore was extracted a little to the east of the starting point on the west side of the A6003. Other quarries opened to the east, south and west of Kettering, all opening and closing at some time between 1875 and 1969. There were also two ironworks in or near the town which used local ore. The Cransley Ironworks stood on the north side of the A43 to the west of what is now the junction with the A14. It began smelting iron in 1877 and ceased production in 1959. The site later became a scrapyard. The Kettering Ironworks, on the west side of the main railway to the north of Rothwell Road, began smelting iron in 1878 and ceased production in 1959, though ore quarrying continued until 1961.

In 1921 Wicksteed Park, Britain&#x27;s second-oldest theme park, was officially opened on the southern outskirts of the town.

From 1942 to 1945 the town witnessed a large influx of American servicemen (including on several occasions Clark Gable), mainly from the US 8th Air Force at RAF Grafton Underwood, away. The airfield was soon nicknamed &quot;Grafton Undermud&quot; in reference to the perceived English weather of &quot;rain, rain and more rain&quot;. The first bombing raid – targeting the marshalling yards at Rouen in northern France – was led by Major Paul W. Tibbets, who in 1945 piloted &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Aircraft from Grafton Underwood dropped the 8th Air Force&#x27;s first and last bombs of the Second World War.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Kettering, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Kettering Town Council and North Northamptonshire Council. The town council has its offices at 10 Headlands and holds its meetings at various venues. North Northamptonshire Council has its main offices in Corby but retains the former Kettering Borough Council headquarters at the Municipal Offices on Bowling Green Road as an area office.

===Administrative history===

Kettering was an ancient parish. Until 1872 the parish was governed by its vestry. In 1872 the parish was made a local government district, governed by a local board. The board subsequently held its meetings at the Town Hall, which was the main assembly room at the Corn Exchange in the Market Place, which had been built by a private company in 1853 to the designs of Edmund Francis Law.

Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894. In 1904 the council moved its meeting place to Stamford Road School (now the William Knibb Centre). Kettering Urban District was enlarged in 1935 to take in Barton Seagrave. The urban district was elevated to become a municipal borough in 1938, allowing the council to appoint a mayor.
The council relocated in 1966 to the Municipal Offices in Bowling Green Road, which had previously been Kettering Grammar School, having been completed in 1913 to the designs of John Alfred Gotch, in the Neoclassical style.

The municipal borough of Kettering was abolished in 1974 to become part of a larger non-metropolitan district called the Borough of Kettering, which also covered Burton Latimer, Desborough, Rothwell and several parishes from the former Kettering Rural District. Kettering itself became an unparished area. Barton Seagrave was re-established as a separate parish in 2002.

The borough of Kettering was abolished in 2021 to become part of the unitary authority of North Northamptonshire, which also took over county-level functions from the abolished Northamptonshire County Council. Concurrent with these changes, the unparished area of Kettering became a civil parish which also gained some land from Cranford and Barton Seagrave, which enabled it to establish a new town council. The new Kettering Town Council inherited the mayoralty from the former borough council.
===Constituency===
Kettering is represented in parliament by a constituency of the same name, which is currently (as of August 2024) represented by Labour MP Rosie Wrighting.

==Economy==

Kettering&#x27;s economy was built on the boot and shoe industry. With the arrival of railways in the 19th century, industries such as engineering and clothing grew up. The clothing manufacturer Aquascutum built its first factory there in 1909. Kettering&#x27;s economy is now based on service and distribution industries due to its central location and transport links.

Kettering&#x27;s unemployment rate is amongst the lowest in the UK and has over 80% of its adults in full-time employment. It is home to a wide range of companies including Aryzta, Weetabix, Pegasus Software, RCI Europe, Timsons Ltd and Morrisons Distribution as well as Wicksteed Park, the United Kingdom&#x27;s second oldest theme park, which now plays host to one and a quarter million visitors every season. It has a very large free playground area, which was built by Wicksteed Playscapes, who are based in Kettering; the company is the world&#x27;s oldest-known playground producer.

Kettering General Hospital provides Acute and Accident &amp; Emergency department services for north Northamptonshire including Corby and Wellingborough. With its new £20 million campus, 16,000 students and 800 staff, Tresham College of Further and Higher Education is a significant employer in the region.

The former police station and social club on London Road has been closed down and as of 2020 the site is for sale. Northamptonshire Police have an enquiry desk situated within the Kettering Municipal Offices.

Kettering Business Park, a recent and current commercial property development undertaken by Buccleuch Property is situated on the A43/A6003, on the north side of Kettering. Many office buildings are being built as part of the project as well as a leisure sector with a new hotel. Many large distribution warehouses have been constructed in the area, creating thousands of jobs for the local economy.

Kettering&#x27;s Heritage Quarter houses the Manor House Museum and the Alfred East Gallery. The magnificent Boughton House, Queen Eleanor cross and the 1597 Triangular Lodge are local landmarks within the borough. Sir Thomas Tresham was a devout Catholic who was imprisoned for his beliefs. When he was released he built Triangular Lodge to defy his prosecutors and secretly declare his faith.

The British sitcom &quot;Peep Show&quot; has various scenes located in Kettering owing to the head office of JLB, the company which employs lead character Mark Corrigan, being located there.

===Regeneration===
In March 2007, a project was revealed to refurbish and bring new leisure and shopping to the town centre, including water features, public art, sculptures, street furniture, trees, plants and an innovative pavement lighting scheme.

Primary Schools in Kettering include St Peter&#x27;s School, an independent school, Park Road School, St Thomas More Catholic School, St Edward’s Catholic Primary School, St Andrew&#x27;s Church of England School, Hawthorn School, Greenfields Primary, St Mary&#x27;s, Millbrook Junior School and a number of others associated with Secondary Academies. A new Church of England primary school, Hayfield Cross, was due to open in September 2015.

Kettering has four secondary schools, each with the ability to take on pupils after the age of 16 to allow pupils to complete their A-Levels and BTEC Diplomas. The four secondary schools located in the town are Bishop Stopford School, Kettering Science Academy, Kettering Buccleuch Academy and Southfield School for Girls. Both the Kettering Science Academy and Kettering Buccleuch Academy have become academies in recent years and both academies are joined to separate primary schools to allow for an easier transition from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3.

Latimer Arts College is also in the area and is located in the nearby village of Barton Seagrave. The school also has a sixth form facility, but no primary schools are specifically linked to them.

Kettering is also home to one of Tresham College of Further and Higher Education&#x27;s three campuses. Tresham allows full and part-time students over the age of 16 to study a range of vocational courses such as Hairdressing and Beauty Therapy, ICT, Hospitality and Catering and Motor Vehicle Technology. Tresham College also offers Access to Higher Education courses and undergraduate courses in association with the University of Bedfordshire and University of Northampton.

==Sport==
The multi-purpose sports and business facility at the Kettering Conference Centre provides both a leisure centre, health club, children&#x27;s activity and conference centre all in one venue. It is also the home to Volleyball England&#x27;s National Volleyball Centre.

===Football===
Kettering Town is the town&#x27;s football club, who as of the 2021–22 season play in the National League North, the sixth tier of English football. Kettering Town played their home matches at Rockingham Road in the town until 2011. Following spells at Nene Park in Irthlingborough and Steel Park in Corby, the team currently plays at Latimer Park in Burton Latimer.

===Rugby===
Kettering is home to Kettering Rugby Football Club (KRFC), located in Waverley Road on the eastern side of the town. After a period of playing under Uppingham Public School Rules the club formally adopted RFU rules in 1875 and became a significant participant in both the local community and the fast-developing Rugby scene in the East Midlands. In the early days games were played on a number of sites including farmers&#x27; fields and council-owned grounds. It was during this period, prior to adopting a home of their own, that the club developed its high profile in the town.

===Other===
A short-lived greyhound racing track was opened on 4 July 1930 and raced on Friday evenings. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. It is not known how long the track traded.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter.

The town&#x27;s local radio stations are Northants 1 and Northants 2 from NN Media, a local media organisation, providing local information, news and advertising and specialises in providing media training for young people in Northamptonshire, they set up originally as Shire Sounds Radio to provide Kettering and the surrounding areas with a local radio station. The area also has BBC Radio Northampton on 103.6 FM, Heart East on 96.6 FM and Smooth East Midlands (formerly Connect FM) on 107.4 FM.

Kettering is served by two local newspapers: &quot;Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Northampton Chronicle and Echo&quot;.

In the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, the character Sonia Fowler moved to Kettering between 2016 and 2017 for a new job, whilst actress Natalie Cassidy was on maternity leave. The town has been referenced several times in the soap since.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The A14 skirts the west and south of the town, links the town with the A45 dual carriageway, M1 and M6 motorways. The A6003 links Kettering to Corby. The A43 links Kettering with Corby and the county town of Northampton and the A509 (Kettering/Wellingborough Road) links Kettering with Wellingborough. The A6 Links Kettering with Rushden and Bedford.

===Buses===
In April 1986, the bus station was relocated away from the market area to the Newland Street entrance of the modern Newlands shopping centre. This caused a fatal decline in market trade, although buses were re-allocated there in April 1987 before closing again in September 1989. A smaller version of a bus station was also closed in May 1999 and so buses just served the library and Newlands Shopping Centre; however, since May 2010, all buses now serve the new Horsemarket bus interchange and they no longer serve the library. New bus stops have been installed around the railway station and The Headlands.

The town is served by bus services operated by Stagecoach Midlands with the following routes:

<text>Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne (; 14 November 1743 – 5 December 1793) was a leader of the French Protestants and a moderate French revolutionary.

==Biography==
Jean-Paul Rabaut was born in 1743 in Nîmes, in the department of Gard, the son of Paul Rabaut. The additional surname of Saint-Étienne was assumed from a small property near Nîmes. His brothers were Jacques Antoine Rabaut-Pommier and Pierre-Antoine Rabaut-Dupuis, both also politically active.

Like his father, he became a Calvinist pastor, and distinguished himself with his zeal for his co-religionists, becoming a spokesman for the Protestant community in France. He worked closely with Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, minister to Louis XVI, and with members of the parlement of the Ancien Régime to obtain formal recognition of Protestant civil rights, despite the concerns of some royal advisors.

Officially ending religious persecution in France, Louis XVI signed the Edict of Tolerance on 7 November 1787, and it was registered in parlement two-and-a-half months later (29 January 1788). This edict offered relief to all the major non-Catholic faiths of the time: Calvinist Huguenots, Lutherans, and Jews. After more than a century of prohibition, it gave them all civil and legal recognition as well as the right to form new congregations openly.

Full religious freedom had to wait two more years for the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789, but the 1787 Edict of Tolerance was a pivotal step in subduing religious strife, and it officially ended religious persecution in France.

Having gained a reputation with his &quot;Histoire primitive de la Grèce&quot;, Rabaut de Saint-Étienne was elected deputy to the Estates-General of 1789 by the third estate of the &quot;bailliage&quot; of Nîmes.

In the Constituent Assembly, he worked on the framing of the constitution; he spoke against the establishment of the republic, which he considered ridiculous; and voted for the suspensive veto, as likely to strengthen the position of the Crown. In the Convention, he sat among the Girondists, opposed the trial of Louis XVI, was a member of the Commission of Twelve and was proscribed with his party.

He remained in hiding for some time, but he was ultimately discovered and guillotined in December 1793.

<text>Paul Rabaut (29 January 1718 – 25 September 1794) was a French pastor of the Huguenot &quot;Church of the Desert&quot;. He was regarded by many as the leader and director of the proscribed church. He was a peacemaker and a scholar despite, due to persecution, living like a troglodyte for more than 30 years.

==Biography==
He was born at Bédarieux, Hérault. His father was a draper. In 1738 he was admitted as a preacher by the synod of Languedoc, and in 1740 he went to Lausanne to complete his studies in the seminary founded by Antoine Court. In 1741 Rabaut was placed at the head of the church of Nîmes, and in 1744 he was vice-president of the general synod. During the persecution of 1745–1752, he was forced into hiding. When the marquis of Paulmy d&#x27;Argenson was sent to Languedoc to make a military inspection in 1750, Rabaut succeeded in interviewing him while he was changing his horses.

For a time the persecution ceased, but it broke out again in 1753, and a price was put on Rabaut&#x27;s head. Louis François de Bourbon, prince de Conti, interested himself in the Protestants in 1755, and in July Rabaut visited him. During the years 1755-1760 periods of persecution and toleration alternated. By 1760, however, the efforts of Antoine Court and Paul Rabaut had been so successful that French Protestantism was well established and organized. In 1762 in a time of relative peace two sites at which Rabaut preached are recorded:

Court de Gébelin, Rabaut himself, and his son Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Etienne now exerted themselves to get it recognized by the law and government. When the people revolted, the minister Turgot in 1775 requested Rabaut to calm them.

His success aroused the jealousy of his colleagues, who tried to undo the good work started by Antoine Court. Rabaut persevered in his efforts to improve the legal position of the Protestants. In 1785, when he was visited by the Marquis de la Fayette, it was arranged that Rabaut&#x27;s son, Rabaut Saint-Etienne, should go to Paris on behalf of the Reformed Church.

In November 1787 King Louis XVI&#x27;s edict of toleration was signed, though it was not registered until 29 January 1788. Two years later liberty of conscience was proclaimed by the National Assembly, of which Rabaut Saint-Etienne was vice-president, and it was declared that non-Catholics might be admitted to all positions. After the fall of the Girondists, however, in which Rabaut Saint-Etienne was involved, Paul Rabaut, who had refused to renounce his title of pastor, was arrested, dragged to the citadel of Nîmes, and kept in prison seven weeks (1794). He died at Nîmes, soon after his release.

<text>Oakham is a market town and civil parish in Rutland (of which it is the county town) in the East Midlands of England. The town is located east of Leicester, south-east of Nottingham and north-west of Peterborough. It had a population of 12,149 in the 2021 census. Oakham is to the west of Rutland Water and in the Vale of Catmose. Its height above sea level ranges from .

==Toponymy==
The name of the town means &quot;homestead or village of Oc(c)a&quot; or &quot;hemmed-in land of Oc(c)a&quot;.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Oakham, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Oakham Town Council and Rutland County Council. The town council is based at Rol House on Long Row. The county council is also based in the town, at Catmose House.

Oakham was an ancient parish, and gave its name to the Oakham Hundred, one of the five historic hundreds of Rutland. When elected parish and district councils were created under the Local Government Act 1894, Oakham was given a parish council and included in the Oakham Rural District. The parish was removed from the rural district in 1911 to become the Oakham Urban District, with the parish council being replaced by an urban district council. The urban district was abolished in 1974 and a new parish council established, taking the name Oakham Town Council.

Oakham, along with the rest of Rutland, has been represented at Westminster by the Conservative Member of Parliament Alicia Kearns since 2019.

==Demography==
Women in the Oakham South East ward had the fifth-highest life expectancy at birth, 95.7 years, of any ward in England and Wales in 2016.

The urban area of the town now extends into the neighbouring parish of Barleythorpe, to the north-west of the town centre.

==Landmarks==
Tourist attractions in Oakham include All Saints&#x27; Church and Oakham Castle. Another historic feature is the open-air market held in the town&#x27;s market place every Wednesday and Saturday. Nearby is the Buttercross with an octagonal stone-slate roof and the wooden stocks – both Grade I listed buildings. 

===All Saints&#x27; Church===
The spire of Oakham parish church, built during the 14th century, dominates distant views of the town for several miles in all directions. Restored in 1857–1858 by Sir George Gilbert Scott, the church is a Grade I listed building.

===Oakham Castle===

Only the great hall of the Norman castle is still standing, surrounded by steep earthworks marking the inner bailey. The hall dates from about 1180–1190. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, in his &quot;Leicestershire and Rutland&quot; volume of the Buildings of England series, noted; &quot;It is the earliest hall of any English castle surviving so completely, and it is doubly interesting in that it belonged not to a castle strictly speaking, but rather to a fortified manor house.&quot; The building is decorated with Romanesque architectural details, including six carvings of musicians. It is a Grade I listed building. The hall was in use as an assize court until 1970 and is still occasionally used as a coroner&#x27;s court or Crown Court. It is also licensed for weddings.

The outer bailey of the castle, which is still surrounded by low earthworks, lies to the north of the castle. Known as Cutts Close, it is now a park. The park has some deep hollows which are remnants of the castle&#x27;s dried-up stew ponds (fishponds). A named HMS &quot;Oakham Castle&quot; was launched in July 1944.
===Oakham&#x27;s horseshoes===

Traditionally, members of royalty and peers of the realm who visited or passed through the town had to pay a forfeit in the form of a horseshoe. This unique custom has been enforced for over 500 years, but nowadays it only happens on special occasions (such as royal visits), when an outsize ceremonial horseshoe, specially made and decorated, is hung in the great hall of the castle. There are now over 200 of these commemorative shoes on its walls. Not all are dated and some of the earliest (which would doubtless have been ordinary horseshoes given without ceremony by exasperated noblemen) may not have survived. The earliest datable one is an outsize example commemorating a visit by King Edward IV in about 1470. Recent horseshoes commemorate visits by Princess Anne (1999), Prince Charles (2003) and Princess Alexandra (2005). The horseshoes hang with the ends pointing down; while this is generally held to be unlucky, in Rutland this was thought to stop the Devil from sitting in the hollow. The horseshoe motif appears in the county council&#x27;s arms and on Ruddles beer labels.
===Rutland County Museum===

The museum is located in the old Riding School of the Rutland Fencible Cavalry which was built in 1794–1795. The museum houses a collection of objects relating to local rural and agricultural life, social history and archaeology.

===Statue of Queen Elizabeth II===

A statue of Elizabeth II by Hywel Pratley was unveiled on 21 April 2024, which would have been the 98th birthday of the late Queen. The 7ft (2.1m) tall sculpture on a limestone base was commissioned by the Lord Lieutenant of Rutland and funded through donations from businesses and members of the public, at the cost of £125,000.

==Transport==
Oakham railway station is a stop on the Birmingham–Peterborough line. It is served by two train operating companies:
* CrossCountry operates a generally hourly service between , , , and .
* East Midlands Railway operate a small number of services in the morning and evening to , , , and Peterborough.

Most bus services in Oakham are operated by Centrebus and Blands. Routes link the town with Corby, Melton Mowbray and Stamford.

The Oakham Canal connected the town to the Melton Mowbray Navigation, the River Soar and the national waterways system between 1802 and 1847.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Waltham TV transmitter.

Rutland&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Leicester on 104.9 FM, Smooth East Midlands on 106.6 FM, Hits Radio East Midlands on 106.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands (which used to be Rutland Radio) on 107.2 FM, Sabras Radio on 91.0 FM and Rutland and Stamford Sound, a community based radio station which broadcast on DAB and online to the county and Stamford in Lincolnshire.

The &quot;Rutland Mercury&quot; and &quot;Rutland Times&quot; are the local newspapers that serve the area.

==Education==

Oakham School is an English public school, founded together with Uppingham School in 1584. The original school building survives, north-east of the church. It has across its south front the inscription &quot;Schola Latina – Graeca – Hebraica A° 1584&quot; and above its door a stone with an inscription in Latin, Greek and Hebrew.

Oakham School is the owner of the town&#x27;s former workhouse. Built in 1836–1837 by the Oakham Poor Law Union, it held 167 inmates until its conversion into Catmose Vale Hospital. It now contains two of the school houses for girls.

Catmose College, founded in 1920, is a state-funded secondary school. Harington School is a sixth form centre next to it. Rutland County College, previously Rutland Sixth Form College, moved from the outskirts of the town to Great Casterton.

<doc id="350459" wikidata="Q1807596" url="?curid=350459" title="Aldridge">
<text>Aldridge is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall in the West Midlands, England. It is historically, a village that was part of Staffordshire until 1974. The town is from Brownhills, from Walsall, from Sutton Coldfield and from Lichfield. The town is also the second-largest town in the Walsall Borough (by population, after Walsall).

== History ==
The name &quot;Aldridge&quot; is derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;alr&quot; or &quot;alre&quot; + &quot;wīc&quot; meaning &#x27;alder (tree) + village&#x27;. Another suggestion is that the name &quot;Aldridge&quot; means &quot;outlying farm among alder-trees&quot;, from the Old English &quot;alor&quot; and &quot;wīc&quot;. It was recorded as &quot;Alrewic&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was valued at 15 shillings and had a population of seven households; the Lord was Robert (d&#x27;Oilly) and the tenant-in-chief was William son of Ansculf. The name was recorded as &quot;Alrewich&quot; and &quot;Allerwych&quot; in the 12th century.

Aldridge began as a small agricultural settlement, with farming being the most common occupation up until the 19th century.

In the 1800s, Aldridge became an industrial town with coal mines and lime kilns. The coal and clay in the area prompted many to set up collieries and brickworks. Aldridge clay is especially useful in the manufacture of blue bricks. The 1881 census shows that the mines and brickworks were major employers. Because the coal and clay beneath the eastern side of Aldridge (towards Stonnall) is located much deeper under the surface, extraction of this coal and clay would not have been economically viable. As a result, farms continued to dominate the eastern part, though a sand quarry was set up and remains on Birch Lane.

Nineteenth and early twentieth century Ordnance Survey maps show an area named Pool Green to the south of Aldridge, across the railway line from Aldridge railway station. A large pool was drained and filled in when the railway line was constructed. Pool Green may have been the site of a Saxon settlement, though no finds have been reported and the area has since been redeveloped.

During the 20th century, modern shops were built in the centre of Aldridge, as well as council buildings. During the Second World War, the small Aldridge Airport was used for military planes. It was subsequently used for passenger services for a time.

Aldridge became an urban district in Staffordshire in 1934. As well as the parish of Aldridge the urban district contained the parishes of Great Barr, Pelsall and Rushall. Other villages within the district included Walsall Wood, Clayhanger and Streetly. These areas began to grow substantially with private house buildings from the 1930s, mostly bought by families relocating from the central areas of Walsall.

The urban district of Aldridge merged with Brownhills on 1 April 1966 to form Aldridge-Brownhills, parts also went to the County Borough of West Bromwich, Lichfield Rural District, Cannock Urban District, the County Borough of Walsall and the County Borough of Birmingham. On 1 April 1966 the parish was also abolished to form &quot;Aldridge Brownhills&quot;, parts also went to Birmingham, Shenstone, Walsall and West Bromwich. In 1961 the parish had a population of 51,046. It then became part of an expanded Metropolitan Borough of Walsall in 1974.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, both wards of Aldridge North &amp; Walsall Wood and Aldridge Central &amp; South populations were both 13,157 and 13,739. When combined, that gives Aldridge a total population of 26,896. Of the findings, the ethnicity and religious composition of the wards separately were:

The religious composition of both wards at the 2021 Census was recorded as:

== Politics ==
The Aldridge-Brownhills constituency is a safe seat for the Conservative Party. Re-elected at the 2024 general election, the Member of Parliament (MP) is Wendy Morton, first elected in 2015. Her predecessor, Sir Richard Shepherd, had held the seat since 1979.

Aldridge is made up of two council wards: Aldridge Central &amp; South, and Aldridge North &amp; Walsall Wood. There are three Conservative Councillors for Aldridge Central &amp; South: Pard Kaur, Bobby Bains, and Tim Wilson.
Aldridge North &amp; Walsall Wood is also covered by three Conservative councilors: Keith Sears, Anthony Harris and Gary Clarke.

== Suburban areas ==
Named suburban areas of or near to Aldridge include Barr Common and Leighswood.

Leighswood, north of the town centre, is mostly a mix of residential, industrial and commercial estates. Leighswood Primary School serves the area. It is also home to the Aldridge Transport Museum on Northgate. Leigh&#x27;s Wood is a Local Nature Reserve and Site of Importance for Nature Conservation comprising a woodland of mainly birch and oak, and a wildlife pond.
== Education ==
Primary schools are Cooper and Jordan Church of England Primary School, Leighswood, St Mary of the Angels (Roman Catholic), and Whetstone Field. Redhouse Primary School closed in 2006. Secondary schools are Aldridge School and St Francis of Assisi Catholic College.

==Industry and commerce==
In Aldridge, there are several factories with several large industrial estates in the area. Some of the most notable factories include the large Ibstock and Weinberger brickworks, and the GKN Driveshafts factory, although the latter company closed in recent years due to relocation and cheaper imports. Birlec, a manufacturer of industrial furnaces relocated to Aldridge in the late 1950s, but has since closed. Aldridge Plastics Ltd, a plastics injection moulder, was set up in the town in 1968 and continued trading for almost 40 years before ceasing production in 2007. From January 2011, GFP Engineering Ltd, a Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) moulding company, will commence trading after relocating from nearby Lichfield. There is also a marina, Aldridge Marina, offering facilities for canal boat moorers.

Most of the town&#x27;s shops are located either on High Street, Anchor Road, or in the shopping area known as &quot;The Parade&quot;. Well-known shops here include WH Smith, Iceland supermarket, Home Bargains, and Boots The Chemist. A purpose-built Safeway (UK) opened in 1992 and started operating as a Morrisons in 2004. B &amp; M took over the former Focus DIY in Coppice Lane and opened its doors for the first time on 1 August 2015. One of the oldest traders in Aldridge is R.H.N. Riley Insurances on Anchor Road, they have been trading since 1957 and in Aldridge since about 1970. Also in the area is a Wetherspoons Public House, in the former Avion cinema, latterly a bingo hall. Many of its original features have been retained including the protected facade.

== Transport ==
Many of the buses in Aldridge were renumbered in April 2010 as part of Centro&#x27;s attempt to simplify bus services in and around the Walsall area. Some subsidised services have changed operators over time, such as 25 previously operated by Arriva, iGo, and Diamond. 

As of July 2024 operating services through Aldridge include - Walsall Community Transport (25), Chaserider (36, 36A), and National Express West Midlands (6, 7, 937, 937A, 997). These services operate to surrounding estates each terminating at Walsall, Birmingham, Sutton Coldfield, Brownhills, Kingstanding, and Lichfield.

Aldridge railway station was on the Sutton Park Line running from Walsall to Birmingham via Sutton Coldfield. It also had a direct link to Wolverhampton on the now defunct Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway as well as a direct link to Brownhills via Walsall Wood although this closed in the 1960s. The station had passenger services to Walsall, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Brownhills. It closed in 1966 and since then the line has been used only for freight. Ongoing speculation about returning passenger services to Aldridge, which would require a new station to be built, has continued with the apparent inclusion of Aldridge and Streetly stations on a map in the 2016 West Midlands Strategic Transport Plan. In February 2021, the West Midlands Combined Authority announced that the land needed for the station to be rebuilt had been acquired for £400,000.

<text>The Oregon missionaries were pioneers who settled in the Oregon Country of North America starting in the 1830s dedicated to bringing Christianity to local Native Americans. There had been missionary efforts prior to this, such as those sponsored by the Northwest Company with missionaries from the Church of England starting in 1819. The Foreign Mission movement was already 15 years underway by 1820, but it was difficult to find missionaries willing to go to Oregon, as many wanted to go to the east, to India or China. It was not until the 1830s, when a schoolmaster from Connecticut, Hall Jackson Kelley, created his &quot;American Society for the Settlement of the Oregon Country,&quot; that more interest and support for Oregon missionaries grew. Around the same time, four Nez Perce arrived in St. Louis in the fall of 1831, with accounts differencing as to if these travelers were asking for &quot;the book of life&quot;, an idea used by Protestant missionaries, or if they asked for &quot;Blackrobes&quot;, meaning Jesuits, thus Catholic missionaries. Either way this inspired Christian missionaries to travel to the Oregon Territory. Oregon missionaries played a political role, as well as a religious one, as their missions established US political power in an area in which the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, operating under the British government, maintained a political interest in the Oregon country. Such missionaries had an influential impact on the early settlement of the region, establishing institutions that became the foundation of United States settlement of the Pacific Northwest.

==Wyeth-Lee Party==

In 1834, New York Methodist minister Jason Lee came to the Oregon Country as the first of these missionaries, to establish the first American settlement and to convert the native population. The party was called the Wyeth-Lee Party as Lee had contracted with Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, who was going on his second trading expedition, to accompany him. The party set out on April 28, 1834, traveling independently from the American Fur Company&#x27;s caravan headed for the same destination. Lee built a mission school for Indians in the Willamette Valley at the site of present-day Salem, Oregon. The school evolved from a mission school to a secondary school called the Oregon Institute, eventually becoming Willamette University, the oldest university on the West Coast.

==Whitman-Spalding Party==
In 1835, Dr. Marcus Whitman made his initial journey west from New York, past the Rocky Mountains and into California. 1836, Marcus Whitman made the same trip, this time with his new wife, Narcissa Whitman, and another missionary couple, Henry Harmon Spalding (who had been jilted by Narcissa) and his wife Eliza Spalding. Narcissa and Eliza were the first white women to cross the Rocky Mountains.

The Whitman&#x27;s reached Fort Walla Walla on October 26, 1838, and founded a mission at Waiilatpu, about 25 miles east of Fort Wallo Wallo in the Walla Walla Valley, then the territory of the Cayuse Indians, in the present-day state of Washington. The Spalding&#x27;s founded a mission among the Nez Perce Indians at Lapwai, at the foot of Thunder Mountain, in present-day Idaho. Henry Spalding is credited with the creation of the Protestant Ladder, used to teach natives history from Creation to ascent into Heaven. This style of teaching, using a long strip of paper or cloth, was based on the Catholic Ladder used by Catholic Missionaries in the region. 

== Catholic Missionaries ==
Catholic missionaries in Oregon Territory followed two paths into the region, with missionaries, such as Father Francis Norbert Blanchet and Father Modeste Demers, coming from Quebec in 1837 and a later group of missionaries following a path similar to the Protestant missionaries coming from the Eastern America, such as Father Pierre-Jean De Smet in 1841. 

Catholic missionary work in Oregon Territory officially began when Fr. Francis Norbert Blanchet was appointed Vicar-General of Oregon Country by Archbishop Joseph Signay of Quebec in April 1838. Fr. Blanchet and Fr. Modest Demers arrived in the region at Fort Vancouver on November 24 1838. Originally the missionaries used hymns and books which had been translated into the Chinook Jargon, a language used commonly among different native groups of the region for trade, in their conversion efforts. Realizing that the ideas and concepts within Catholicism were not coming across to their audiences, Fr. Blanchet began using carved shale sticks in his conversion efforts in April 1839, during a visit to the Cowlitz settlement. The shale stick, referred to as the Catholic Ladder, was carved with representations of Christian History. These shale sticks were then distributed to Native chiefs, starting in October 1839, to teach Catholicism. Soon after, the Catholic Ladder began to be produced in paper copies and later massed produced for distribution in the Pacific Northwest with Quebec church leaders arranging for the printing and shipping of 2,000 to the region. Later, Protestant missionaries began using their own version of the ladder, with Henry Spalding being credited with creating the Protestant Ladder using some images from the Catholic Ladder and adding his own. Both the Catholic and Protestant ladders would also represent the opposing domination as heathens.

In 1841, The Rocky Mountain Mission in the Pacific Northwest was started by Fr. Pierre-Jean De Smet and became the most sought-after mission post among Jesuits. The majority of Jesuit missionaries were Italian, owing to instability at home during the period, but missionaries from other nations came to region as well.

Blanchet was made Bishop in 1843, along with the region being made into an Apostolic Vicariate which reached from the Arctic in the North, the Rockies in the East, and the US-Mexican border in the South. Later, in 1846, the region was made into the Ecclesiastical Province of Oregon with Blanchet becoming the archbishop of the archiepiscopal see of Oregon City. This made Oregon the second Ecclesiastical Province created in the US.

Catholics in the region faced persecution by the majority Protestant white settlers, with Father Augustin Magliore Blanchet, Francis Blanchet&#x27;s brother, being blamed for the Whitman Massacre in 1847, despite only arriving in Walla Walla three months prior to the events.

==Legacy of Early Oregon Missionaries==
Missionary work in the Oregon country continued into the 1850s, though in 1853, the Washington territory was established, separate from the Oregon territory to which it had previously belonged. The success in converting Native Americans to Christianity was varied. In some cases, the Indians were very suspicious of the missionaries, and this suspicion only increased when many of the Indians contracted diseases that were introduced by missionaries and White settlers.

As tensions between native tribes and White missionaries rose during the 1850s, resulting in small-scale wars between settlers and natives, like the Rogue River War, missionary work in Oregon was increasingly targeted at White immigrants from the eastern parts of the US, rather than native populations.

<doc id="350473" wikidata="Q1658068" url="?curid=350473" title="Ikaruga">
<text>is a bullet hell shoot &#x27;em up developed by Treasure. It is the spiritual sequel to &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; (1998) and was originally released in Japanese arcades in December 2001. The story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using a specially designed fighter called the Ikaruga which can flip between two polarities, black and white. This polarity mechanism is the game&#x27;s key feature and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. All enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets which are the same color as the player are absorbed while the others will kill the player. The game features both single-player and cooperative modes.

Development on &quot;Ikaruga&quot; began during director Hiroshi Iuchi&#x27;s off-hours while Treasure was busy developing &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot; (2000). Titled &quot;Project RS2&quot;, the game began as a sequel to &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;, and borrows many elements from it as well as the polarity mechanism from Treasure&#x27;s &quot;Silhouette Mirage&quot; (1997). During the game&#x27;s prototype stages, the player&#x27;s ammo was limited. The bullet absorption mechanism was used as a means to refill ammo. However, this was found to be weak as it created too many breaks in the action so it was later added as an additional mode in home ports. In tradition with Treasure&#x27;s game design philosophy, &quot;Ikaruga&quot; was intentionally crafted to challenge the conventions of standard game design and develop a new type of shooting game. All together, five Treasure staff worked on &quot;Ikaruga&quot;, as well as three support staff from G.rev.

Upon its initial release in Japanese arcades, reception was mixed. Treasure staff explained this was due to players expecting a more standard shooter offering but instead being greeted with a different game system that featured more puzzle-like elements rather than the twitch gameplay of bullet-dodging. In 2002, &quot;Ikaruga&quot; was ported to the Dreamcast in Japan and began to grow a cult following from import gamers worldwide. It was later released in the West in 2003 on the GameCube, receiving positive reviews. Critics praised the graphics as well as the art and sound design. Some criticism was directed towards its difficulty. Most critics felt the unique game design choices were innovative, while some believed they stifled many of the classic shooter elements. &quot;Ikaruga&quot; was later ported to the Xbox 360, Windows, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4. In retrospect, &quot;Ikaruga&quot; is regarded by critics as one of the best games ever made, especially in the shoot &#x27;em up genre, and one of Treasure&#x27;s greatest works.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Ikaruga&quot; is a vertically scrolling shoot &#x27;em up. The game features five stages, three levels of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to &quot;Ikaruga&quot; is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player&#x27;s bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.
&quot;Ikaruga&quot; does not feature any pick-ups or power-ups, instead, the player can only rely on their standard firing weapon and a homing laser. Absorbed bullets contribute to building the player&#x27;s homing laser attack. The power of the attack increases one level for every 10 enemy bullets absorbed. Each level is equal to one laser, with a maximum of 12 which can be stored. A homing laser is 10 times more powerful than a standard shot. The game&#x27;s scoring system is based upon chaining attacks to earn bonuses. Destroying three enemy fighters of the same color in a row will earn the player a chain bonus. The player will earn 100 points for their first chain bonus, and double the amount for each bonus thereafter. These bonuses can be multiplied up to a maximum of 25,600, but if interrupted by destroying an enemy out of order, the bonus will be reset.

Home console ports of &quot;Ikaruga&quot; feature additional gameplay modes apart from the standard arcade mode. Modes are available that allow players to practice single stages they have unlocked at normal or slow speeds. A challenge mode is available which logs players&#x27; scores and compares them to others worldwide. If certain conditions are met, a prototype mode is unlocked which limits the number of bullets the player has. Bullets must be absorbed to keep ammo in stock. In an alternative way to play the standard game called &quot;Bullet Eater&quot;, the player does not fire any shots and instead navigates through all the stages by absorbing bullets.

==Synopsis==
Many years ago on the island nation of Horai, leader of the nation, Tenro Horai, discovered the Ubusunagami Okinokai (lit. The Power of the Gods). This energy emanated from an object she dug up from deep underground, which granted her unimaginable powers. Soon after, Tenro and her followers, who call themselves &quot;The Divine Ones&quot;, began conquering nations one after another. &quot;The Divine Ones&quot; carried out these conquests in &quot;The name of peace&quot;.

A freedom federation known as The Tenkaku emerged to challenge Horai. Using fighter planes called Hitekkai, they fought with the hope of freeing the world from the Horai&#x27;s grips, but their efforts were in vain, as they were no match for The Horai and were almost completely wiped out. Miraculously, however, one young man called Shinra (森羅) survived the battle.

Shot down near a remote village, inhabited by elderly people who were exiled by the Horai&#x27;s conquests, Shinra was rescued from the wreckage and was nursed back to health. Shinra pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane designed by former engineering genius Amanai with the help of the village leader Kazamori, called The Ikaruga. Hidden in a secret underground bunker and launched via the transportation device called &quot;The Sword of Acala&quot;, Ikaruga is the first fighter to be built with both energy polarities, and is capable of successfully switching between the two.

Shinra battles against the Horai across the game&#x27;s five stages, and ultimately faces Tenro Horai herself. He destroys her ship, killing her and releasing the octahedron-shaped object stored inside, which appears to be the source of the Power of the Gods and partly resembles the Stone-Like object featured in Treasure&#x27;s previous game &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;. Shinra releases the Ikaruga&#x27;s restraint device and unleashes a massive attack to destroy the object for good, sacrificing himself in the process as the ship overheats and explodes.

In the two-player game, Shinra is accompanied by Kagari (篝), a mercenary of the Horai defeated by Shinra. After Shinra spared her life, she decided to fight against Horai alongside the resistance. Her ship, The Ginkei, was modified by the people of Ikaruga village to give it the ability to switch between the two polarities, like the Ikaruga. Kagari&#x27;s fate at the end of the game is the same as Shinra&#x27;s, dying as her ship is destroyed in the final attack against the object.

==Development==
Development of &quot;Ikaruga&quot; began while Treasure&#x27;s &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot; (2000) was still in development. &quot;Ikaruga&quot; was self-funded (and later self-published). Since company resources were allocated for &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot;, director Hiroshi Iuchi worked on &quot;Ikaruga&quot; at home on his spare time and developed a prototype with help from programmer Atsutomo Nakagawa. &quot;Ikaruga&quot; shares basic shooter gameplay elements with an earlier Treasure shooter, &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; (1998). Additionally, the polarity elements are similar to those in their earlier game &quot;Silhouette Mirage&quot; (1997). Another source of inspiration was the defense system in &quot;Shinrei Jusatsushi Taromaru&quot; (1997) for the Sega Saturn. Iuchi reused sprites from &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; so he could finish the prototype quickly. A unique feature to the original design was a limited ammo supply. The player&#x27;s stock was replenished by absorbing enemy bullets. This mechanism was seen as weak since it created gaps in the action when no bullets could be fired. Gameplay ideas in the prototype version were later included in a special bonus mode in the final game. After further testing and consultation between team members, the final gameplay system was implemented.

&quot;Ikaruga&quot; has been described as a spiritual sequel to &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;. Originally, &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; was intended to be a trilogy, and &quot;Ikaruga&quot; began development as a direct sequel, codenamed &quot;Project RS-2&quot;. The concept theme for &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; was “World”, and for Ikaruga it was “Will”. In keeping with Treasure&#x27;s game design philosophy, &quot;Ikaruga&quot; was intentionally designed to challenge the conventions of standard game design and develop a new type of shooting game. The game&#x27;s difficulty lies in the puzzle-like elements of changing polarities rather than bullet-dodging. Unlike &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;, the scoring system was not tied to gameplay. In this way, the game was designed to appeal to both players who play for score and those who did not. In the beginning, the stages were designed with the combo system in mind, however this made the optimal route too obvious. Instead, the team redesigned the stages and enemies so it would be more difficult for player to determine the route for the most optimal score. The game&#x27;s pacing follows a &quot;mountain&quot; and &quot;valley&quot; approach, in which the music and action will peak, followed by a melancholy atmosphere, only to build up tempo again. By the time development was finished, 5 Treasure staff had worked on the game, as well as 3 support staff from G.rev which was raising funds to develop its own shooter, &quot;Border Down&quot; (2003).

==Release==

&quot;Ikaruga&quot; was targeted to Treasure&#x27;s core fanbase, as pleasing them was the team&#x27;s first priority. Although the game was primarily being developed for the Sega NAOMI arcade platform, it was standard for NAOMI games to be ported to the Dreamcast, and so the development team had this in mind. The NAOMI version was bug checked on a Dreamcast, so porting was very easy. &quot;Ikaruga&quot; was first released in arcades in Japan on 20 December 2001. A Dreamcast port was released exclusively in Japan on 5 September 2002. Although not yet published in the West, &quot;Ikaruga&quot; began to garner a cult following in North America among import gamers.

On August 15, 2002, it was announced that Infogrames&#x27; Japanese division had picked up the publishing rights to a GameCube version of the game and would release the title in January 2003 under the Atari brand name. The game was released in Japan on January 16, 2003. Initially, Infogrames&#x27; North American and European divisions had no plans to release the title nationwide, but on January 28, 2003, it was announced that Infogrames would publish the GameCube version in those territories as well, with representatives at the publisher citing the popularity of the title in Japan and a growing fan base around the world. The game was released in North America on April 15, and in Europe on May 9, branded under the Atari label as in Japan.

On 12 September 2007, Microsoft announced they were planning on releasing &quot;Ikaruga&quot; on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. It was released on 9 April 2008, and included new features such as leaderboards, achievements, and the ability to record and replay playthroughs. Treasure later released &quot;Ikaruga&quot; on the arcade distribution platform, NESiCAxLive, on 8 August 2013. In October 2013, Treasure placed the title into the Steam Greenlight process to bring the game (based on the Xbox 360 version) to Microsoft Windows, with hopes to bring their other titles to the platform later. The game was released on Steam on 18 February 2014. It was also published by Nicalis for the Nintendo Switch on 29 May 2018, supporting both horizontal and vertical screen orientations. In June 2018, &quot;Ikaruga&quot; was also released on the PlayStation 4. On 22 November 2019, Nicalis announced that physical copies were in production for both the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4.

==Reception and legacy==
Initial reception of &quot;Ikaruga&quot; in Japan was mixed. Players praised the visuals and music, but opinions were divided on the gameplay system. Director Hiroshi Iuchi noted that players would tell him “this isn’t an arcade game...make it more thrilling and fast-paced.” Both Iuchi and producer Masoto Maegawa stated that this mixed reception was due to players expecting a more standard shooter offering. They both felt &quot;Ikaruga&quot; was a brand new type of shooter and that bringing variety was important to the growth of game centers. In February 2002, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the game as being the fifth most popular arcade game in Japan at the time. The original Dreamcast port of &quot;Ikaruga&quot; was well received by Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot;. He praised the game for its visuals, sound, and challenging difficulty. He also praised the game for bringing back a dead genre to the forefront, saying &quot;&quot;Ikaruga&quot; takes 20 years of great ideas in game design and somehow manages to put an entirely new spin on them...for the sake of making a game that&#x27;s both familiar and utterly unique.&quot;

The GameCube release received generally favorable reviews by western critics. The visuals, art design, and sound were universally praised and some criticism was directed towards the game&#x27;s short length. Critics agreed that &quot;Ikaruga&quot;″s game design was &quot;innovative&quot;, &quot;clever&quot;, and &quot;unique&quot;. The difficulty was both highlighted for being inviting to old-school shooter fans, but was also criticized for building a barrier to genre newcomers. Tyrone Rodriguez of &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;a shooter-fan&#x27;s shooter,&quot; and Corbie Dillard of Nintendo Life stated &quot;if you&#x27;re a shooter fan, you absolutely must own at least one version of this masterpiece.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; listed &quot;Ikaruga&quot; as their Game of the Month for April 2003, while &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best GameCube title of that month. Reception of the Xbox 360 and Windows ports was similar to the GameCube version. Topher Cantler of &quot;Destructoid&quot; gave &quot;Ikaruga&quot; a perfect score and dubbed it a &quot;work of art&quot;. Although most critics still agreed that &quot;Ikaruga&quot;″s unique game design was a positive characteristic, Simon Parkin of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; offered a counterpoint that its fresh design is also its weakness, in that it stifles many of the other elements that define shoot &#x27;em ups and morph it into something different and &quot;inscrutable.&quot; Reviews of the Switch port were also positive.

&quot;Ikaruga&quot; continues to be one of the most revered shooters of all time. The Xbox 360, Windows, and Switch ports have received positive reviews.
&quot;IGN&quot; voted &quot;Ikaruga&quot; the 3rd greatest 2D shooter of all time. Adam Smith of &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot; called &quot;Ikaruga&quot; one of Treasure&#x27;s greatest works and &quot;one of the most perfect games [he] ever played.&quot; Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 shared similar sentiments, calling it one of Treasure&#x27;s most popular games, and &quot;one of the most remarkable shooters of all time.&quot; In 2020, Slant ranked Ikaruga 92nd on its 100 Best Video Games of All Time. They praised the unique polarity gameplay saying it &quot;stylishly revitalizes the genre.&quot;

The Dreamcast and GameCube versions sold 33,860 physical units in Japan. The Xbox Live Arcade version sold 137,088 digital units on the Xbox 360, . The PC version has sold 128,543 digital units on Steam, .

<text>Bardas (; died 21 April 866) was a Byzantine noble and high-ranking minister. As the brother of Empress Theodora, he rose to high office under Theophilos (. Although sidelined after Theophilos&#x27;s death by Theodora and Theoktistos, in 855 he engineered Theoktistos&#x27;s murder and became the &quot;de facto&quot; regent for his nephew, Michael III (). Rising to the rank of &quot;Caesar&quot;, he was the effective ruler of the Byzantine Empire for ten years, a period which saw military success, renewed diplomatic and missionary activity, and an intellectual revival that heralded the Macedonian Renaissance. He was assassinated in 866 at the instigation of Michael III&#x27;s new favourite, Basil the Macedonian, who a year later would usurp the throne for himself and install his own dynasty on the Byzantine throne.
==Biography==
===Early life===
Bardas was born to the &quot;droungarios&quot; Marinos and Theoktiste, and was the elder brother of Empress Theodora, the wife of Emperor Theophilos, and of Petronas. Three other sisters, Maria, Sophia and Irene, are recorded by Theophanes Continuatus. The family was of Armenian origin and had settled in Paphlagonia. Some modern genealogists, including Cyril Toumanoff and Nicholas Adontz, have suggested a link of Bardas&#x27;s family with the Armenian noble clan of the Mamikonian. According to Nina Garsoïan in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium&quot;, however, &quot;[a]ttractive though it is, this thesis cannot be proven for want of sources.&quot;
In 837, Theophilos raised him to the rank of &quot;patrikios&quot; and sent him together with the general Theophobos in a campaign against the Abasgians, but the Byzantines were defeated. With the death of Theophilos, his son Michael III () ascended the throne. As he was only two years old, a regency council was set up headed by Theodora. Bardas and his brother Petronas, as well as their relative Sergios Niketiates, were also members, but it was the logothete Theoktistos who quickly established himself as Theodora&#x27;s chief advisor. Bardas still played an active role in the early days of the regency, encouraging Theodora to abandon Iconoclasm for good and taking part in the investigations that led to the deposition of the pro-iconoclast patriarch John the Grammarian and the restoration of the veneration of icons in 843. Bardas was quickly sidelined by Theoktistos, however. According to Symeon the Logothete, Theoktistos blamed Bardas for the desertions that led to the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Mauropotamos against the Abbasids in 844, even though the logothete himself had led the Byzantine army. As a result of these accusations, Bardas was exiled from Constantinople for an undetermined period of time. 

Following Bardas&#x27;s exile and the death of Sergios, Theoktistos ruled supreme alongside Theodora for a decade. In 855, Michael III turned fifteen and thus came nominally of age. His mother and Theoktistos arranged a bride show and selected Eudokia Dekapolitissa as his bride, disregarding Michael&#x27;s attachment to his mistress, Eudokia Ingerina. Bardas used Michael&#x27;s resentment for the high-handed manner in which he was treated, and began to turn him against the regency. With Michael&#x27;s backing, Bardas was allowed to return to the capital, and on 20 November 855, Theoktistos was murdered. This was possibly done at the emperor&#x27;s behest, for Bardas is said to have favoured a more &quot;elegant&quot; removal of his rival.

===Ascendancy and fall===
With the death of Theoktistos, the regency was at an end; in early 856, Michael proclaimed his assumption of full imperial power, and in 857 Theodora was forced to retire to the Gastria Monastery. Nevertheless, as Michael was more interested in his pleasures and his continuing affair with Eudokia Ingerina, Bardas now became the &quot;de facto&quot; regent of the Empire. By he was promoted to the highest state offices (&quot;magistros&quot; and &quot;chartoularios tou kanikleiou&quot;), followed by his promotion to &quot;kouropalates&quot;—according to Symeon the Logothete, this happened after a failed assassination attempt masterminded by Theodora—and finally, on Holy Wednesday (22 April 862), to &quot;caesar&quot;. The dominance of Bardas is corroborated by non-Byzantine sources: al-Tabari records that Arab envoys negotiated with Bardas, rather than the emperor, and Bar Hebraeus writes that during an audience with an Arab embassy, Michael did not utter a single word, with his &quot;cousin&quot; (most likely Bardas) speaking on his behalf. Petronas also emerged from obscurity at the same time, becoming &quot;strategos&quot; of the Thracesian Theme and leading a series of successful raids against the Arabs.

Although later sources are critical of his character, describing him as vain, avaricious and power-hungry, his capabilities as an administrator are widely acknowledged. Thus Bardas founded the Magnaura School with seats for philosophy, grammar, astronomy and mathematics, supported scholars like Leo the Mathematician and promoted the missionary activities of Cyril and Methodius to Greater Moravia. He also scored a number of successes against the Arabs in the East, culminating in the decisive Battle of Lalakaon in 863, and enforced the Christianization of Bulgaria by Byzantine missionaries. The &quot;Patria of Constantinople&quot; praise him also for his building activity, but aside from a church dedicated to Saint Demetrius outside the city itself, most of the buildings attributed to him were probably the work of Basil I the Macedonian ().

In 858, Bardas deposed patriarch Ignatios and appointed Photios, well-educated but a layman, in his stead. Later chronicles report that Ignatios had excluded Bardas from communion because he maintained an incestuous relationship with one of his daughters-in-law, but the real reason for Ignatios&#x27;s deposition was probably the patriarch&#x27;s staunch refusal to tonsure Empress Theodora against her will, as demanded by Bardas. The irregular elevation of Photios, however, alienated Pope Nicholas I, who refused to recognize it. Coupled with competition between Rome and Constantinople over their missionary activities in and jurisdiction over Moravia and Bulgaria, relations with the papacy remained tense.

Despite his great authority, Bardas&#x27;s control over his nephew was not absolute: after he managed to persuade him to dismiss his old chamberlain (&quot;parakoimomenos&quot;), Damian, Michael appointed to the post not one of Bardas&#x27;s own protégés, but his favourite companion, the ruthlessly ambitious Basil the Macedonian. Bardas&#x27;s own position was further weakened in early 866, when Michael learned that Eudokia Ingerina was pregnant with the future Leo VI: hitherto Bardas stood to succeed to the throne if anything should happen to the emperor, but now Michael had a direct heir. Instead of divorcing his wife and marrying his long-time mistress, however, Michael married off Ingerina to Basil instead, who divorced his own wife first. In spring of the same year, Bardas began assembling a large-scale expedition against the Saracen stronghold of Crete. Accompanied by Michael, Basil and the court, Bardas made for Miletus, where the army was assembling. There, on 21 April 866, he was murdered by Basil, ostensibly for plotting against the emperor.

The campaign was abandoned while Michael and Basil returned to Constantinople, where Michael adopted his friend and made him co-emperor. In September 867, Basil had Michael III assassinated as well, ending the Amorian dynasty and inaugurating the Macedonian period of Byzantine history.

===Family===
Bardas was married twice. From his unknown first wife, who must have died before 855, he had a son named Antigonos, a daughter named Irene, an unnamed son, and another daughter who married the logothete Symbatios (although she may be identical with Irene). Some time around 855, Bardas married for a second time, but divorced this wife, by the name of Theodosia, in 862. Of Bardas&#x27;s sons, Antigonos was appointed Domestic of the Schools while still a boy and still held the post at the time of his father&#x27;s murder, while little is known about the other son, except that in 858 he was given the hand of his father&#x27;s mistress, whom Bardas had discarded in order to marry Theodosia, and was appointed &quot;monostrategos&quot; (&quot;single-general&quot;) of the Empire&#x27;s European themes. Bardas&#x27;s second daughter was married to the &quot;patrikios&quot; and logothete Symbatios. Symbatios participated in the plot to assassinate Bardas, hoping to succeed him. He rose in revolt when Basil became co-emperor, but was defeated, mutilated and exiled.

<text>Redcar and Cleveland is a unitary authority area with borough status in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England. Its council has been a unitary authority since 1996.

The borough was created in 1974 as Langbaurgh, and was one of four boroughs in the non-metropolitan county of Cleveland. It was renamed Langbaurgh-on-Tees in 1988, and given its present name when Cleveland was abolished in 1996; the borough was made a unitary authority in the same year. Redcar and Cleveland is part of the Tees Valley combined authority, which also includes the boroughs of Darlington, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees; the latter three were also formerly in Cleveland County.

Its main settlement is the town of Redcar. Other notable towns and villages include South Bank, Eston, Brotton, Guisborough, Greater Eston, Loftus, Saltburn-by-the-Sea and Skelton.

==History==
The district was created in 1974 as the borough of Langbaurgh, one of four districts of the new non-metropolitan county of Cleveland. It was formed from the Coatham, Eston Grange, Kirkleatham, Ormesby, Redcar and South Bank wards of the County Borough of Teesside, along with Guisborough, Loftus, Saltburn and Marske-by-the-Sea and Skelton and Brotton urban districts, from the North Riding of Yorkshire. The borough was named after the ancient Langbaurgh wapentake of Yorkshire. On 1 January 1988 the borough was renamed Langbaurgh-on-Tees.

Cleveland County was abolished on 1 April 1996, with its districts becoming unitary authority areas. At this time Langbaurgh-on-Tees was renamed Redcar and Cleveland. Upon becoming a unitary authority, Langbaurgh-on-Tees Borough Council was renamed Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council and acquired all the full rights and duties as a county, whilst retaining the same boundaries as before.

== Demographics ==

==Local Industry==

The main industry within the greater district of the town of Redcar is the Chemical Industry located close to Wilton village on the Chemical Industry Park known internationally as Wilton. The chemical companies are all members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC).

The Wilton chemical site is owned by Singaporean utility company Sembcorp and companies operating there include SABIC who have recently built the world&#x27;s largest low-density polyethylene plant (LDPE) and still operate an ethylene cracker. Lotte Chemicals are expanding both PTA and PET production. Huntsman manufacture polyurethane intermediates and Ensus have built Europe&#x27;s largest bioethanol facility. Biffa Polymers now operate a polymer recycling plant that handles up to 30% of the UKs plastic milk bottles. While in support of Sembcorp, who built the UK&#x27;s first wood-fired power station (Wilton 10), UK Wood Recycling Limited have a significant facility on the site providing waste wood to fuel Wilton 10.

The Teesside Steelworks operated Europe&#x27;s second largest blast furnace. The majority of the steelworks (including the Redcar blast furnace, Redcar and South Bank coke ovens and the BOS plant at Lackenby) closed in 2015, but the Teesside Beam Mill still operates, producing beams for the construction industry.

==Social housing==

===Coast and Country Housing Limited===
Coast and Country took over the ownership and management of homes from Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council in July 2002. In addition to providing core housing services the company has also invested in independent living services, including the development of a new Telecare service in partnership with the Borough Council.

===Beyond Housing===
In 2018, Coast and Country merged with Yorkshire Coast Homes to form Beyond Housing Limited, a Community Benefit Society with 15,000 properties across Teesside and North Yorkshire.

==Local nature reserves==
The council maintains a number of Local nature reserves. These are Guisborough Branch Walkway, Flatts Lane Woodland Country Park and Rosecroft Wood, Loftus Wood, Whitecliff Wood, Clarksons Wood, Errington Wood and Eston Moor.

==Towns and parishes==

There are five civil parishes in the borough. The parish councils for Guisborough and Loftus have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The north-west of the borough, corresponding to the parts that were in the County Borough of Teesside between 1968 and 1974 (including Redcar and Eston and adjoining areas), is an unparished area. The parishes are:
*Guisborough
*Lockwood
*Loftus
*Saltburn, Marske and New Marske
*Skelton and Brotton

==Wards==
As of 2024, the borough has 24 wards represented by 59 councillors. These are named:
Belmont, Brotton, Coatham, Dormanstown, Eston, Grangetown, Guisborough, Hutton, Kirkleatham, Lockwood, Loftus, Longbeck, Newcomen, Normanby, Ormesby, Saltburn, Skelton East, Skelton West, South Bank, St Germain&#x27;s, Teesville, West Dyke, Wheatlands, and Zetland.

<doc id="350491" wikidata="Q1025076" url="?curid=350491" title="Keswick, Cumbria">
<text>Keswick ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the Cumberland unitary authority area of Cumbria, England. Historically, until 1974, it was part of the county of Cumberland. It lies within the Lake District National Park, just north of Derwentwater and from Bassenthwaite Lake. The parish had a population of 5,243 at the 2011 census.

There is evidence of prehistoric occupation of the area, but the first recorded mention of the town dates from the 13th century, when Edward I of England granted a charter for Keswick&#x27;s market, which has maintained a continuous 700-year existence. The town was an important mining area, and from the 18th century has been known as a holiday centre; tourism has been its principal industry for more than 150 years. Its features include the Moot Hall; a modern theatre, the Theatre by the Lake; one of Britain&#x27;s oldest surviving cinemas, the Alhambra; and the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery in the town&#x27;s largest open space, Fitz Park. Among the town&#x27;s annual events is the Keswick Convention, an Evangelical gathering attracting visitors from many countries.

Keswick became widely known for its association with the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey. Together with their fellow Lake Poet William Wordsworth, based at Grasmere, away, they made the scenic beauty of the area widely known to readers in Britain and beyond. In the late 19th century and into the 20th, Keswick was the focus of several important initiatives by the growing conservation movement, often led by Hardwicke Rawnsley, vicar of the nearby Crosthwaite parish and co-founder of the National Trust, which has built up extensive holdings in the area.

==Name==
The town is first recorded in Edward I&#x27;s charter of the 13th century, as &quot;Kesewik&quot;. Scholars have generally considered the name to be from the Old English, meaning &quot;farm where cheese is made&quot;, the word deriving from &quot;cēse&quot; (cheese) with a Scandinavian initial &quot;k&quot; and &quot;wīc&quot; (special place or dwelling), although not all academics agree. George Flom of the University of Illinois (1919) rejected that derivation on the grounds that a town in the heart of Viking-settled areas, as Keswick was, would not have been given a Saxon name; he proposed instead that the word is of Danish or Norse origin, and means &quot;Kell&#x27;s place at the bend of the river&quot;. Among the later scholars supporting the &quot;cheese farm&quot; toponymy are Eilert Ekwall (1960) and A. D. Mills (2011) (both Oxford University Press), and Diana Whaley (2006), for the English Place-Name Society.

==Prehistory==

Evidence of prehistoric occupation in the area includes the Castlerigg stone circle on the eastern fringe of the town, which has been dated to . Neolithic-era stone tools were unearthed inside the circle and in the centre of Keswick during the 19th century. The antiquary W. G. Collingwood, commenting in 1925 about finds in the area, wrote that they showed &quot;Stone Age man was fairly at home in the Lake District&quot;. There is little evidence of sustained settlement in the area during the Bronze Age, but from excavations of hill forts it is clear that there was some Iron Age occupation, circa 500 BC, although scholars are not agreed about how permanent it was.

In Roman Britain Cumbria was the territory of the Carvetii. As the site of the western part of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, it was of strategic importance. The north of the county is rich in archaeological evidence from the period, but nothing is known that suggests any Roman habitation in the Keswick area, other than finds that point to the existence of one or more Roman highways passing the vicinity of the present-day town. Such nearby settlements as can be traced from the era of the Romans and the years after their departure seem to have been predominantly Celtic. Many local place names from the period, including that of the River Derwent, are Celtic, some closely related to Welsh equivalents.

Several Christian saints preached the Gospel in the north of England in the late 6th and early 7th centuries AD; in Keswick and the surrounding area the most important figures were St Herbert of Derwentwater and his contemporary St Kentigern. The former, the pupil and friend of St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, lived as a hermit on an island in Derwentwater, now named after him. Kentigern, who lived and preached in the area before moving to Wales, is traditionally held to have founded Crosthwaite Church, which was the parish church of Keswick until the 19th century.

==History==

===Middle Ages===

Keswick&#x27;s recorded history starts in the Middle Ages. The area was conquered by the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria in the 7th century, but Northumbria was destroyed by the Vikings in the late 9th century. In the early 10th century the British Kingdom of Strathclyde seized the area, and it remained part of Strathclyde until about 1050, when Siward, Earl of Northumbria, conquered Cumbria. In 1092 William II of England, son of William the Conqueror, marched north and established the great baronies of Allerdale-below-Derwent, Allerdale-above-Derwent, and Greystoke, the borders of which met at Keswick. In 1181 Jocelyn of Furness wrote of a new church at Crosthwaite, Keswick, founded by Alice de Romilly, the Lady of Allerdale, a direct descendant of William II&#x27;s original barons. In 1189, Richard I granted the rectory of Crosthwaite to the Cistercian order of Fountains Abbey.

During the 13th century, agricultural land around the town was acquired by Fountains and Furness Abbeys. The latter, already prosperous from the wool trade, wished to expand its sheep farming, and in 1208 bought large tracts of land from Alice de Romilly. She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey, to which she sold Derwent Island in Derwentwater, land at Watendlath, the mill at Crosthwaite and other land in Borrowdale. Keswick was at the hub of the monastic farms in the area, and Fountains based a steward in the town, where tenants paid their rents. Furness also enjoyed profitable rights to the extraction of iron ore.

 Keswick was granted a charter for a market in 1276 by Edward I. This market has an uninterrupted history lasting for more than 700 years. The pattern of buildings around the market square remained broadly the same from this period until at least the late 18th century, with houses – originally timber-framed – fronting the square, and sturdily enclosed gardens or yards at the back. According to local tradition these stout walls and the narrow entrances to the yards were for defence against marauding Scots. In the event it appears that the town escaped such attacks, Scottish raiders finding richer and more accessible targets at Carlisle and the fertile Eden Valley, well to the north of Keswick.

===16th and 17th centuries: agriculture and industry===

With the Dissolution of the Monasteries, between 1536 and 1541, Furness and Fountains Abbeys were supplanted by new secular landlords for the farmers of Keswick and its neighbourhood. The buying and selling of sheep and wool were no longer centred on the great Abbeys, being handled locally by the new landowners and tenants. This enhanced Keswick&#x27;s importance as a market centre, though at first the town remained only modestly prosperous: in the 1530s John Leland wrote of it as &quot;a lytle poore market town&quot;. By the second half of the century, copper mining had made Keswick richer: in 1586 William Camden wrote of &quot;these copper works not only being sufficient for all England, but great quantities of the copper exported every year&quot; with, at the centre, &quot;Keswicke, a small market town, many years famous for the copper works as appears from a charter of king Edward IV, and at present inhabited by miners&quot;.

Earlier copper mining had been small in scale, but Elizabeth I, concerned for the defence of her kingdom, required large quantities of copper for the manufacture of weapons and the strengthening of warships. There was the additional advantage for her that the Crown was entitled to royalties on metals extracted from English land. The experts in copper mining were German, and Elizabeth secured the services of Daniel Hechstetter of Augsburg, to whom she granted a licence to &quot;search, dig, try, roast and melt all manner of mines and ores of gold, silver, copper and quicksilver&quot; in the Keswick area and elsewhere.
As well as copper, a new substance was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, and is now known as graphite. Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a heat-resistant glaze for crucibles, and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon. Later, from the second half of the 18th century, it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous.

The copper mines prospered for about seventy years, but by the early 17th century the industry was in decline. Demand for copper fell and the cost of extracting it was high. Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving. Although the boom of the mid-16th century had finished, the town&#x27;s economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.
===18th and 19th centuries: beginnings of tourism===

The historian George Bott regards John Dalton (1709–63) and John Brown (1715–66) as the pioneers of tourism in the Lake District. Both wrote works praising the majesty of the scenery, and their enthusiasm prompted others to visit the area. The poet Thomas Gray published an account of a five-day stay in Keswick in 1769, in which he described the view of the town as &quot;the vale of Elysium in all its verdure&quot;, and was lyrical about the beauties of the fells and the lake. His journal was widely read, and was, in Bott&#x27;s phrase, &quot;an effective public relations job for Keswick&quot;. Painters such as Thomas Smith of Derby and William Bellers also contributed to the influx of visitors; engravings of their paintings of Cumberland scenery sold in large numbers, further enhancing the fame of the area. In 1800 the Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, &quot;It is no small advantage that for two-thirds of the year we are in complete retirement – the other third is alive &amp; swarms with Tourists of all shapes &amp; sizes.&quot; Coleridge had moved to Keswick in that year, and together with his fellow Lake Poets (see below) was possibly the strongest influence on the public esteem of Keswick and the Lake District.

During the 18th century and into the 19th, turnpike trusts were established and major roads in Cumberland were greatly improved. With the Lake District now accessible by coach the area attracted well-off visitors, particularly at times of war in mainland Europe, which made the aristocratic Grand Tour impossible there. Regular public coach services were established in the 1760s, but they were expensive. The ten-hour journey from Whitehaven to Penrith via Keswick cost 12 shillings (numerically equivalent to 60p), at a time when country labourers typically earned 10 shillings a week or less, and the annual income of even the most prosperous tenant farmers was rarely more than £200. Nonetheless, by the 19th century the number of tourists visiting Keswick during each season was estimated at between 12,000 and 15,000. Some of the Keswick inns that catered for affluent visitors remain as hotels, including the Queen&#x27;s, where Gray stayed.
The construction of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new Bessemer process of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the coking coal from Durham on the east side of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy excursion tickets at discounted prices, such as six shillings for the return journey from Preston to Keswick.

In addition to its growing importance as a tourist centre, Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century. It had begun on a modest scale in about 1792, as a cottage industry, using graphite mined locally. This developed on more industrial lines in factories purpose-built by several companies. Pencil making was the town&#x27;s most important manufacturing industry by the mid-19th century, textiles and leather goods having declined.

The Moot Hall was rebuilt in 1813, and the lower floor was used as a market house on Saturdays. Coal gas was supplied by a gas works from 1846; the Keswick library opened in 1849; a water works began operation in 1856; and Keswick police station opened in 1857. The local weekly newspaper, &quot;The Keswick Reminder&quot; was founded in 1896, and in 2019 continues to be published every Friday. In an article in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1978, Christopher Brasher wrote that as long as the &quot;Reminder&quot; flourishes, &quot;there will be one corner of these islands that is forever England.&quot;
In 1883 Hardwicke Rawnsley was appointed vicar of Crosthwaite. In a study of Lake District towns in 1974, H. A. L. Rice commented that to write about Keswick without mentioning Rawnsley would be the equivalent of writing about Stratford-upon-Avon without mentioning Shakespeare, so great was Rawnsley&#x27;s impact on the town. He and his wife set up classes to teach metalwork and wood carving; these grew into the Keswick School of Industrial Art, which trained local craftsmen and women from 1894 until it closed in 1986. He revived the ancient May Day festival in the town, and was a leading figure in the establishment of Keswick School, Blencathra Sanatorium and the County Farm School. As co-founder of the National Trust, Rawnsley contributed to Keswick&#x27;s continued growth as a tourist centre, with the acquisition by the Trust of many acres of popular scenic land around Derwentwater, beginning with Brandelhow Wood in 1902.

===20th century and beyond===
Keswick&#x27;s history throughout the 20th century was one of increasing reliance on tourism, the pencil industry being the second largest source of employment. The Cumberland Pencil Company, formed at the turn of the century, occupied a large factory near the River Greta on the road leading out of Keswick towards Cockermouth. The conservation movement continued to develop; Rawnsley led successful campaigns to save the medieval Greta and Portinscale bridges from replacement with ferro-concrete structures; and the National Trust continued to acquire land locally. In the First World War Keswick lost many of its young men: the war memorial near Fitz Park commemorates 117 names, from a population at the time of less than 4,500. By the 1930s Keswick was firmly established as the main centre of tourism in Cumberland and Westmorland. An article in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; in 1934 called it &quot;the capital of the Lake District&quot;, and continued:
During the Second World War, students from St Katharine&#x27;s College, Liverpool, and Roedean School, Sussex, were evacuated to Keswick when their own buildings were requisitioned for use as a hospital and a navy base respectively. Students were also brought to the safety of Keswick from Central Newcastle High School, Hunmanby Hall School, Yorkshire, and the Liverpool Orphanage.

The creation of the Lake District National Park in 1951, with strict control over new development, prevented any expansion of the town beyond its pre-war borders. Keswick&#x27;s population has remained stable at a little below 5,000 residents. The town&#x27;s reliance on tourism increased in 2006 when Cumberland Pencils moved production from Keswick to Lillyhall, Workington, only the Derwent Pencil Museum remaining at the old site. At the beginning of the 21st century, more than 60 per cent of the population were employed in hotels, restaurants and distribution. A survey of retail premises in 2000 found that more than ten per cent were outdoor clothes shops, a similar proportion were cafés or restaurants, and more than eight per cent were gift shops. The age profile of the Keswick population is significantly higher than the English average. In 2011 children under 10 made up 7.6 per cent of the town&#x27;s population, compared with 11.9 per cent for England as a whole. Between ages 10 and 20 the comparable figures are 10.2 and 12.1; and from ages 20 to 44, 25.9 as against 34.3. The percentage of Keswick&#x27;s population aged 45 and upwards is above the national average, the largest difference being within the 75- to 84-year-old bracket, which contains 9.6 per cent of Keswick&#x27;s population compared with a national average of 5.5. Figures from the same census show that Keswick has fewer than average &quot;large employers and higher managerial occupations&quot; and more small employers and self-employed people. Long-term unemployment is considerably below the average for England.

===Ownership===

In medieval times the township was within the manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater. The earliest surviving official record of the town is the market charter of 1276 granted to the lord of the manor, Thomas de Derwentwater. The manor was granted by Alice de Romilly to Adam de Derwentwater before 1216, and subsequently passed to the Radclyffe family through marriage. The Derwentwater estate was forfeit to the Crown after the execution of James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater in 1716 for his involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1715. In 1735 the Crown granted the income from the estates to support the Greenwich Hospital, London. Land to the south and west were part of Greenwich Hospital&#x27;s forestry and farming estates until the 19th century. In 1925 the then owner, Sir John Randles, gave the National Trust of land in this estate, including the foreshore woodland.

==Governance==
Keswick became a Local Government District in 1853 and an urban district with three wards in 1894, reflecting its growth in the latter part of the 19th century. The new urban district&#x27;s northern boundary was extended from the Greta to the railway, taking in Great Crosthwaite and part of Underskiddaw in 1899. In 1974 the urban district was abolished and then the town was administered by Allerdale Borough Council. The electoral ward of Keswick stretched beyond the confines of the parish boundary and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 5,243.

Today, Keswick is administered by Keswick Town Council and Cumberland Council.

Since 2024 Keswick has been in the Penrith and Solway parliamentary constituency, having previously been part of Copeland, and before that Workington and, earlier, Penrith and The Border.

==Geography==
Keswick lies in north-western England, in the heart of the northern Lake District. The town is southwest of Carlisle, northwest of Windermere and southeast of Cockermouth. Derwentwater, the lake southwest of the town, measures approximately and is some deep. It contains several islands, including Derwent Isle, Lord&#x27;s Island, Rampsholme Island and St Herbert&#x27;s Island, the largest. Derwent Isle is the only island on the lake that is inhabited; it is run by the National Trust and open to visitors five days a year. The land between Keswick and the lake consists mainly of fields and areas of woodland, including Isthmus Wood, Cockshot Wood, Castlehead Wood and Horseclose and Great Wood, further to the south. The River Derwent flows from Derwentwater to Bassenthwaite, the most northerly of the major Cumbrian lakes. The Derwent and its tributary the Greta, which flows through Keswick, meet to the east of Portinscale. The source of the Greta is near Threlkeld, at the confluence of the River Glenderamackin and St John&#x27;s Beck.

Keswick is in the lee of the Skiddaw group, the oldest group of rocks in the Lake District. These fells were formed during the Ordovician period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they form a triangle sheltering the town, reaching a maximum height of on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of Thornthwaite, is Whinlatter Forest Park and Grisedale Pike. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is St John&#x27;s in the Vale, at the foot of the Helvellyn range, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick. In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested £100,000 to remove power lines and replace them with underground cables, to improve the quality of scenery in the vicinity.

Climatically, Keswick is in the North West sector of the UK, which is characterised by cool summers, mild winters, and high monthly rainfalls throughout the year. Keswick&#x27;s wettest months fall at the end of the year, the peak average of falling in October. Rain, sunshine and temperature figures are shown below.

==Demography==
The registers of Crosthwaite Church stated that there were 238 interments in 1623, believed to have been something between a twelfth and a tenth of the whole population of the parish at that time. In the 1640s there was a sharp fall in population, brought on by the plague epidemic which affected Keswick, Carlisle, Cockermouth and Crosthwaite and other areas in 1645–47.

In the 1801 census, the township of Keswick, including the town and surrounding hamlets, had a reported population of 1,350 people. The population grew at a steady rate, increasing to 1,683 in 1811, 1,901 in 1821, 2,159 in 1831, 2,442 in 1841, and 2,618 in 1851. In 1871 the township had a population of 2,777 people. The population grew at a faster rate towards the late 19th century and by 1901 it stood at 4,451 people. There has been little fluctuation in population since, and in the 1991 census the town had a population of 4,836. In the 2001 census, 4,984 people were recorded, and 4,821 in 2011. At the 2021 census, 54.3% of the population identified as Christian, 37.8% as non-religious, 0.4% as Buddhist, 0.3% as Muslim, 0.2% as Hindu, and 0.3% as some other faith. The remaining 6.7 per cent did not specify their religion.

==Landmarks==
Keswick is the home of the Theatre by the Lake, opened in 1999. The theatre serves a dual purpose as the permanent home of a professional repertory company and a venue for visiting performers and festivals. It replaced the Century Theatre or &quot;Blue Box&quot;, which had spent 25 years in semi-retirement on a permanent lakeside site in Keswick, after a career of similar length as a mobile theatre. The Alhambra cinema in St John Street, opened in 1913, is one of the oldest continuously functioning cinemas in the country; it is equipped with digital technology and satellite receiving equipment to allow the live screening of plays, operas and ballet from the National Theatre, Royal Opera House and other venues.

The town is the site of the Derwent Pencil Museum. One of the exhibits is what is claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest coloured pencil. Fitz Park, on the bank of the River Greta, is home to the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery, a Victorian museum which features the Musical Stones of Skiddaw, Southey manuscripts, and a collection of sculptures and paintings of regional and wider importance, including works by Epstein, John Opie, Richard Westall and others. After extensive restoration and enlargement the museum reopened in 2014. In 2001 the cricket ground in Fitz Park was named the most beautiful in England by &quot;Wisden Cricket Monthly&quot;.

Greta Hall (see Lake Poets, below), is a Grade I listed building. The home of Coleridge in 1800–04 and Southey from 1803 until 1843, it later became part of Keswick School and is now in private ownership, partly divided into holiday flats. The three-storey house dates to the late 18th century and features a flush-panelled central double door with Gothic top panels and Venetian windows. A carved oak fireplace inside is dated to 1684. The Moot Hall is a prominent Grade II* listed building situated at the southern end of Main Street. It was built in 1571 and rebuilt in 1695, and the current building dates to 1813. It is built of lime-washed stone and slate walling, and has a square tower on the north end with a round-arched doorway and a double flight of exterior steps. At the top of the tower is what the Keswick Tourist Information Board describes as an &quot;unusual one-handed clock&quot;. Formerly an assembly building, The Moot Hall contains a tourist information centre on the ground floor, with an art gallery on the floor above.

The prominent social thinker and art critic John Ruskin, who had links to Keswick, is commemorated by a memorial at Friars&#x27; Crag. Erected in 1900 on Rawnsley&#x27;s initiative, it is a Grade II listed structure.

===Churches===
Until 1838, Keswick had no Anglican church within the town boundaries and was part of the widespread parish of Crosthwaite. The present parish church, St John&#x27;s, was designed by Anthony Salvin and consecrated in 1838. It is geometrical in style, with pink castle-head ashlar sandstone and a slate roof. The church was extended in 1862, 1882 and 1889 by the parish&#x27;s benefactors the Marshall family; the chancel windows, designed by Henry Holiday, installed in 1879, were taken down and reinstalled when the chancel was extended in 1889. St John&#x27;s became a Grade II* listed building in 1951. Keswick&#x27;s former parish church, St Kentigern&#x27;s, at Crosthwaite, just outside the town, is also Grade II* listed. Dated to at least the 14th century, it is built mainly in the Tudor-Gothic style and was expanded in 1523 and later restored in 1844 by George Gilbert Scott.

The Quakers had an early meeting house in the town, replaced in 1715 by one at Underskiddaw. Protestant dissenters met at a private house from 1705 or before, moving to a chapel in Lake Road in the latter part of the 18th century. A Congregational chapel was built in 1858–59. The first Wesleyan chapel was built in 1814 in a small yard off Main Street at a cost of £331 10s; the present Methodist church is in Southey Street. Since 1928 Roman Catholics in Keswick have been served by Our Lady of the Lakes and St Charles in High Hill. A new Quaker meeting house opened in the town in 1994. An Eastern Orthodox church was inaugurated in 2007, holding services in Keswick and the nearby village of Braithwaite.

There are no other religious buildings in Keswick; Muslim worship was accommodated on Fridays in a room at the local council building in Main Street. This has since discontinued.

===Public houses and hotels===
Keswick&#x27;s old inns and their successors include many listed buildings, mainly Grade II in designation. The George Hotel, stated to be the oldest inn in the town, dates to the 16th century, with the alterations made during the Georgian period still evident. The King&#x27;s Arms Hotel, in the main market square, dates from the early 19th century; it is built from stuccoed stone, with Victorian shop windows on the ground floor. The Queen&#x27;s Hotel in Main Street, a pebbledashed stone building dating from the late 18th century, was renamed &quot;The Inn on the Square&quot; in 2015. The Bank Tavern in Main Street and the Dog and Gun public house in Lake Road are both Grade II listed 18th-century buildings.

==Education and health==
The Crosthwaite Free Grammar School, adjoining Crosthwaite churchyard, was an ancient institution, its date of foundation uncertain. In 1819 the parish of Crosthwaite had five or six schools in the town and the outlying areas, with a total of 332 children. By 1833 Keswick had twelve daily schools, including a new National School at High Hill. The new parish church of Keswick, St John&#x27;s, started educational work in 1840 with a Sunday school which also educated infant boys, and later girls, on weekdays. A full-time boys&#x27; school opened in 1853. For older pupils, Keswick School, the free co-educational grammar school, successor to the Crosthwaite Free Grammar School, opened at a site diagonally opposite Greta Bridge in 1898. In 1951 a new secondary modern school was built at Lairthwaite in Underskiddaw.

Junior education is provided by St Herbert&#x27;s School, which had a roll of 263 in 2013. At senior level, Keswick and Lairthwaite schools merged in 1980 as a single comprehensive secondary school, with the name Keswick School. It was included in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s list of the top thirty comprehensives in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2014. The Local Education Authority for Keswick is Cumbria.

The Mary Hewetson Cottage Hospital, founded in 1892, has fifteen beds and a minor injuries unit. It underwent a major rebuilding and upgrade in 2013.

==Sport==
Keswick is home to Keswick Football Club. The principal team plays in the Westmorland League Division One, and it also has a reserve team which plays in Westmorland League Division Two, a female team which plays in the Cumbria League, juniors who compete in the under-16, under-14, under-12 and under-10 categories in the Penrith Junior Football League; there is a veteran team, which competes in the Cumbria League. Keswick Rugby Union Football Club, established in 1879, plays at Davidson Park, and has teams that play in the Cumbrian League and the Cumbria Rugby Union Raging Bull Competition. The rugby club is involved in the organisation of the Keswick Half Marathon, usually held in the first week of May.

Keswick Tennis Club has grass courts in upper Fitz Park, and also runs hard courts on Keswick&#x27;s Community Sports Area in the lower park area. Keswick Cricket Club was established in the 1880s. Its principal team competes in the North Lancashire and Cumbria Cricket League, Premier Division. The second team plays in the Eden Valley Cricket League, 3rd Division, and the club also has junior under-11, under-13, and under-15 teams and a women&#x27;s cricket team. Keswick Fitz Park Bowls Club was founded in 1882.

In cycling, Keswick hosted the Keswick Bikes Borrowdale Cross of the North West League, second round, in September 2010 for junior riders, an event that was supported by the British Cycling Federation. The same month, the town hosted an activity weekend for children, involving the juniors of the Brooke Steelers Wheelchair Basketball Team, whose senior players who were competing in a race from Keswick to Penrith to raise money for children&#x27;s cancer. Keswick is also home to Keswick Croquet Club, Keswick Archers, and Greta (Keswick) Junior Badminton Club, for children from eight to 16 years of age. The town leisure centre, Keswick Leisure Pool and Fitness Centre, is operated and managed by Carlisle Leisure Limited (CLL), and has a pool and fitness facilities, and offers lessons in canoeing.

==Transport==
Keswick is on the A66 road linking Workington and Penrith, as well as the A591, linking the town to Windermere, Kendal and Carlisle (via the A595).

There are no rail links to Keswick; the line built in the 1860s for the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway closed in 1972. Since the 1990s a plan to rebuild it has been under discussion. Some 90 per cent of the earthworks of the railway still exist, but according to 2000 estimates, a reopening would cost £25 million. In 2014 the only public transport serving the towns and villages on the old railway route is a bus service operating at mostly hourly intervals. The bus journey from the main line station at Penrith to Keswick takes a scheduled 47 minutes.

The town is served by other bus routes providing direct connections with Carlisle, Cockermouth, Kendal, Lancaster, Penrith, Windermere, Workington, and other towns and villages in the north west. The flow of traffic from Penrith to Cockermouth and beyond was eased after the A66 was diverted to a new bypass in 1974, a development that caused controversy because of a prominent new viaduct carrying the road across the Greta Gorge to the north of the town.

The majority of visitors arrive by car and are catered for by three town centre car parks, another large one next to the Theatre by the Lake, and smaller ones elsewhere in the town.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the Caldbeck and local relay transmitters. 
Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria on 95.6 FM, Smooth Lake District on 101.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland on 96.4 FM, and Lake District Radio, a community radio station that broadcast online.

Local newspapers are The Keswick Reminder and Westmorland Gazette. 

==Culture==

===Regular events===
Annual events in the town&#x27;s calendar include the Keswick Film Festival (February–March). It features screenings of old and new films, interviews with directors, and the festival&#x27;s Osprey Awards for short films by local filmmakers. The ten-day Words by the Water literary festival is held in March every year, based at the Theatre by the Lake. The festival began in 1995, and events have been presented by Melvyn Bragg, Louis de Bernières, Germaine Greer, Steve Jones, Penelope Lively, Princess Michael of Kent, Michael Rosen and Joanna Trollope.

In May each year, Keswick is host to three contrasting events. The Keswick Half Marathon, in the early part of the month takes participants around Derwentwater with an additional loop into Newlands Valley. In the second week of May there is the four-day Keswick Jazz Festival, with more than 100 jazz events at a dozen local venues. Participants include British and international exponents of mainstream and traditional jazz. After the Jazz Festival is the four-day Keswick Mountain Festival in mid-May. In the words of the organisers, the festival &quot;celebrates everything we all love about the outdoors&quot;. It includes ghyll scrambling, mountain biking, guided walks, map reading, canoeing, climbing, a triathlon and other events.

The main event of the town&#x27;s calendar in June is the Keswick Beer Festival, a two-day event that attracts more than 5,000 participants each year. July is marked by the opening of the annual Keswick Convention, an international gathering of Evangelical Christians, described in 1925 as &quot;the last stronghold of British Puritanism&quot;, promoting biblical teaching and pious lifestyles. Among those associated with the Convention have been Frank Buchman and Billy Graham. The event has grown from a single week to three weeks, straddling the latter part of July and early August.

In August, Keswick features the Derwentwater Regatta. It was inaugurated by the eccentric local landowner Joseph Pocklington in 1792, and after a lapse of more than two centuries was revived in 2013. Its organisers describe it as &quot;A weekend of mayhem and madness afloat, with the chance to climb aboard in a variety of races on Derwentwater&quot;. The Keswick Agricultural Show, founded in 1860, has traditionally been held on August Bank Holiday Monday at the western edge of the town on the Crossing Fields section of the open land known as the Howrahs. The show features both commercial and charity stands, and attracts large numbers of competitors, exhibitors and spectators. From 2014 the venue has changed to Pump Field, a few hundred yards further from the town centre towards Braithwaite.

Classical music is presented throughout the year, both in conjunction with the Lake District Summer Music Festival and independently through the Keswick Choral Society and the Keswick Music Society, which was founded in 1947. Performers in Keswick have included the Chilingirian Quartet, the Royal Northern Sinfonia, Tasmin Little, the City of London Sinfonia, Red Priest and Nicolai Demidenko.

===Lake Poets and other Keswick notables===

Coleridge and William Wordsworth were close friends and collaborators; when Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy took up residence in the Lake District in late 1799 it was, in Bott&#x27;s word, inevitable that Coleridge would follow suit. Six months after the Wordsworths moved into Dove Cottage at Grasmere, Coleridge leased Greta Hall in Keswick, away. In 1803 Robert Southey, Coleridge&#x27;s brother-in-law, agreed to share the house with Coleridge and his family. Southey remained at Greta Hall after Coleridge left in 1804, and it remained Southey&#x27;s family home until his death in 1843. Many famous literary figures stayed at Greta Hall in these years, including the Wordsworths, Charles and Mary Lamb, Thomas de Quincey, William Hazlitt, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Sir Walter Scott. Lamb, a Londoner devoted to his native city, remained doubtful of the attractions of the Lake District, but most of the visitors to Greta Hall wrote eloquently of the beauty of the scenery, and further enhanced the public regard for, and desire to visit, the area. Southey was well regarded locally, but played little part in the life of the town. He is buried in Crosthwaite churchyard and there is a memorial to him inside the church, with an inscription written by Wordsworth.
Among Keswick notables before the Lake Poets was Sir John Bankes, a leading Royalist during the English Civil War. He was Charles I&#x27;s Attorney General and Chief Justice. Bankes was born at Castlerigg near Keswick in 1589. A bust in his memory is in upper Fitz Park close to the museum. In 2014 he was further commemorated by the conversion of the former Keswick courthouse into a bar named in his honour with his full title, &quot;The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas&quot;.

Later residents of the area have included the classical scholar, essayist, poet and founder of the Society for Psychical Research, Frederic Myers, who was born in Keswick, and the campaigner for animal welfare Donald Watson, founder of the Vegan Society, who lived in Keswick after retiring from teaching. The pioneer mountaineers and photographers George and Ashley Abraham lived and worked in Keswick. Their photographic shop in Lake Road, built in 1887, was later taken over by the local mountaineer and outfitter George Fisher; the shop still contains memorabilia, including photographs, from the Abrahams&#x27; era.

Of literary figures after the Lake Poets among those most closely associated with Keswick was the novelist Hugh Walpole. In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange at the opposite end of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, &quot;That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn&#x27;t born a Cumbrian isn&#x27;t my fault: that Cumbrians, in spite of my &#x27;foreignness&#x27;, have been so kind to me, is my good fortune.&quot;

<text>Alton ( ) is a market town and civil parish in East Hampshire, England, near the source of the northern branch of the River Wey. It had a population of 19,425 at the 2021 census.

Alton was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 as &quot;Aoltone&quot;. During the Saxon period Alton was known as &quot;Aweltun&quot;. The Battle of Alton occurred in the town during the English Civil War. It also has connections with Sweet Fanny Adams and Jane Austen.

==History==

===Early history===
The Alton Hoard of Iron Age coins and jewellery found in the vicinity of the town in 1996 is now in the British Museum.
There is evidence of a Roman posting station at Neatham near Alton, probably called Vindomis, and a ford across the River Wey on the line of a Roman road that ran from Chichester to Silchester. An Anglo-Saxon settlement was established in the area and a 7th-century cemetery was discovered during building excavations. It contained grave goods including the &quot;Alton Buckle&quot; which is on display in the Curtis Museum and considered to be the finest piece of Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship found in Hampshire. The buckle, found in the grave of a warrior, has a silver-gilt body set with garnets and glass.

The River Wey has a source in the town, and the name &quot;Alton&quot; comes from an Anglo-Saxon word &quot;aewielltun&quot; meaning &quot;farmstead at the source of the river&quot;.

In 1001 Danish forces invaded England and during the First Battle of Alton the forces of Wessex came together and fought against them. About 81 Englishmen were killed, including Ethelwerd the King&#x27;s high-steward, Leofric of Whitchurch, Leofwin the King&#x27;s high-steward, Wulfhere a bishop&#x27;s thane, and Godwin of Worthy, Bishop Elfsy&#x27;s son. The Danes were the victors although Danish casualties were higher and fleeing Englishmen took refuge in Winchester.

Aoltone, in the &#x27;Odingeton Hundred — Hantescire&#x27; is recorded as having the most valuable market in the Domesday Book.

The Treaty of Alton was signed in 1101 between William the Conqueror&#x27;s eldest son Robert II of Normandy and his brother Henry I of England. Henry had seized the throne while his elder brother was away on the First Crusade. Robert returned to claim the throne, landing in Portsmouth. The brothers met in Alton and agreed terms which formed the Treaty of Alton. Part of the main street through Alton is called Normandy Street, probably reflecting this event.

===Middle Ages===
The first recorded market in Alton was in 1232, although the market at Neatham first recorded in the Domesday Book may also have been in the town. Blome wrote in 1673 of a &#x27;market on Saturdays, which is very great for provisions, where also are sold good store of living cattle&#x27;. The Saturday market is featured on Kitchin&#x27;s map of Hampshire (1751) which marks the town as &quot;Alton Mt. Sat.&quot;

1307 was, in fact, the first year of Edward II&#x27;s reign but Edmund of Woodstock was not lord of the manor then. According to the Victoria County History (written after Curtis&#x27; book):-

As can be seen, Queen Margaret held the manor until 1317 and so the fair could not have been granted to Edmund of Woodstock in 1307.

The correct date for the grant seems to be 22 November 1320 (according to the Charter Rolls, 14 Edward II, no.15). The grant was for a 9-day fair – the vigil [eve] and feast of Whitsuntide and seven days after.

The two main manors in Alton – Alton Eastbrook and Alton Westbrook – had a fair each. That of Alton Eastbrook has no extant charter, and may never have had one. It was originally held on St Lawrence&#x27;s Day and so its origin was, presumably, the patronal festival. The religious aspect would have ceased when the country was no longer Roman Catholic. This fair seems to have been held on Crown Close (which is in the manor of Alton Eastbrook) in the early 19th century. When this land was built upon, the fair moved and was held where ever the Westbrook fair was – the Market Place, various meadows and the Butts.

The date of the Eastbrook fair was changed to Michaelmas in the mid-18th century as it came during harvest time and the farmers were not satisfied. Some accounts for this fair in the early 18th century do survive and show that there was a cheese fair as well the usual mix of travelling and local people with stalls and stands – people selling lace, gloves, books, gingerbread, bodices, sugar plums, toys, soap and knives, to name but a few. By the late 19th century, this fair was said to be mainly for horses, sheep and, occasionally, hops. Alton still has an annual fair, but it now takes the form of a carnival.

===Modern period===
Eggar&#x27;s School was founded in 1640 by John Eggar of Moungomeries as the &quot;Free Grammar School&quot;. It later became known as Eggar&#x27;s Grammar School. It occupied a site in Anstey Road until it moved to a new site in Holybourne in 1969.

A battle was fought in Alton during the English Civil War. A small Royalist force was quartered in the town when on 13 December 1643 they were surprised by a Parliamentary army of around 5,000 men. The Royalist cavalry fled, leaving Sir Richard Bolle (or Boles) and his infantry to fight. Outnumbered, the Royalists were forced into the Church of St Lawrence, where Bolle was killed along with many of his men. Over 700 Royalist soldiers were captured and bullet holes from the battle are still visible in the church today.

In 1665, Alton suffered an outbreak of bubonic plague, but soon recovered.
On Saturday, 24 August 1867, an eight-year-old girl, Fanny Adams, was murdered in Alton. Her assailant, Frederick Baker, a local solicitor&#x27;s clerk, was one of the last criminals to be executed in Winchester. Fanny Adams&#x27; grave can still be seen in Alton cemetery. The brutal murder, so the story goes, coincided with the introduction of tinned meat in the Royal Navy, and the sailors who did not like the new food said the tins contained the remains of &quot;Sweet Fanny Adams&quot; or &quot;Sweet F.A.&quot; The expression &quot;sweet fanny adams&quot; has an old-fashioned slang meaning of nothing.

==Governance==
Prior to the Local Government Act 1972, Alton had fallen under the aegis of the (now defunct) Alton Urban District Council. The Act resulted in the dissolution of this body, and the establishment (on 1 April 1974) of the current Alton Town Council. The responsibilities of the Alton Urban District Council were divided between the new Alton Town Council, the Hampshire County Council and the newly formed East Hampshire District Council. The Council meets at Alton Town Hall, in Market Square.

Alton was significant in the 18th century for the manufacture of paper and of dress materials including ribbed druggets, shallons, silks and serges, bombazine and figured barragons.

Alton has businesses in the retail and service sectors in the centre of the town, and over a hundred businesses in the four industrial areas of Mill Lane, Newman Lane, Caker Stream and Omega Park, ranging from light industrial to computer software production.
Clarcor, TNT N.V. and Poseidon Diving Systems all have businesses in Alton&#x27;s Industrial Site, Mill Lane.

One of Alton&#x27;s largest commercial employers is the financial services sector. Lumbry Park, which used to be known as Lumbry Farm, is on the B3006 Alton to Selborne road, and is occupied by Inter Group Insurance Services (IGIS), a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Inter Group employs over 170 people on this site, and specialises in travel insurance. The company has operated in Alton since 1999. It was acquired by Churchill Insurance in 2001, becoming part of RBS Insurance division in 2003 as part of an RBS takeover. However, on 11 November 2008, Inter Group announced its proposal to close its office in Alton in August 2009 due to &quot;changes in the travel insurance market&quot;, leading to the loss of 104 full-time staff and around 16 part-time.

Alton has a range of chain stores and independent shops including greengrocers, butchers and a hardware shop. There are five main supermarkets that serve the town.

Alton lies approximately midway between the University of Winchester and the University of Surrey at Guildford but its nearest University campus is the University for the Creative Arts in Farnham. It is home to Treloar&#x27;s, an independent educational establishment founded in 1907 by Sir William Purdie Treloar, Lord Mayor of London, to provide education for young people with physical disabilities. Treloar&#x27;s now runs Treloar School and College, a provision of education for pupils aged from 2–25 with physical and learning difficulties in Holybourne.

The state secondary schools in Alton are Eggar&#x27;s School (formerly the Grammar School), and Amery Hill School. There is an independent Catholic day school, Alton School (formerly Alton Convent School), which educates boys and girls from 6 months to 18 years old. Sixth-form education is provided by Alton College, which has gained outstanding inspection reports from Ofsted.

==Transport==
Alton station is on the National Rail network at the end of the Alton line with a service to London Waterloo.

Alton railway station is the terminus for the Watercress Line, formerly the Mid Hants Railway, a restored steam railway running between Alton and New Alresford, so called because it used to be used to transport fresh watercress to London. The Watercress Line is now a charity largely operated by volunteers, and best known for its events such as Steam Illuminations, War on the Line and Day Out With Thomas featuring Thomas the Tank Engine.

The origins of the Watercress Line date back to 1861, the year in which Parliament granted consent for what was then known as the &#x27;Alton, Alresford and Winchester Railway&#x27;. Four years later the Mid Hants Railway opened, and the train service continued until the line was closed in 1973. Then in 1977 the line was partially re-opened, in 1983 it was extended further, and in 1985 it was re-opened as far as Alton to connect with the mainline London service.

Alton was previously the site of a railway junction at Butts Junction. As well as the Mid-Hants Railway, from 1903 to 1955 the Meon Valley Railway ran from Alton down the Meon Valley to join the Eastleigh to Fareham line at Fareham. The Basingstoke &amp; Alton Light Railway ran north to Basingstoke.

Buses in Alton are operated by Stagecoach South. These buses include, 64 to Winchester (via Four Marks, Ropley, Bishop’s Sutton, New Alresford and Science Centre), 65 to Guildford (via Bentley and Farnham), 13 to Basingstoke or Whitehill (this route is via Alton, it also includes Odiham and Hook if going towards Basingstoke) and 38 to Petersfield (via Chawton, Selborne, Greatham and Liss).

<text>Alfreton ( or locally ) is a town and civil parish in the Amber Valley district of Derbyshire, England. The town was formerly a Norman Manor and later an Urban District. The population of the Alfreton parish was 8,799 at the 2021 Census. The villages of Ironville, Riddings, Somercotes and Swanwick were historically part of the Manor and Urban District, and the population including these was 24,476 in 2001.

==History==
Alfreton is said to have been founded by King Alfred and to have derived its name from him. The placename appears in different forms throughout the ages, such as &#x27;Elstretune&#x27; in Domesday, but the earliest record appears to occur in CE1004 in the will of Wulfric Spott, the founder of Burton Abbey. Amongst his bequests was &#x27;Aelfredingtune&#x27;, or &#x27;Alfred&#x27;s farmstead&#x27;, which is believed to relate to Alfreton. However, there is no evidence that this Alfred was the aforementioned king.

To the southwest near Pentrich was a Roman fortlet on the major road known as Ryknield Street. Another Roman road known as Lilley Street ran from there to the southern end of Alfreton, suggesting that settlement in the area predated the time of King Alfred by several centuries.

The initial settlement was centred at the top of the modern King Street hill, where the original market place developed. On the hilltop there was also an ancient meeting hall (the &#x27;Moot Hall&#x27;) until 1914, and several inns became established over the centuries, some of which survive today. To the west was a manor house, and the nearby Church of St. Martin, parts of which date back to 1200. The manor of Alfreton spread over lands to the south and east, including the parishes of Somercotes, Swanwick, Riddings, and Ironville. The first Lord of the Manor was Earl Roger de Busli, who delegated the position to Baron Ralf Ingram. The position was passed down variously through heredity, gift, and sale over the centuries up until William Palmer-Morewood, the last Lord of Alfreton, who died in 1957.

The economy during the medieval period centred on agriculture. However, the presence of readily accessible and extensive deposits of coal and ironstone in the area meant that mining and iron-working grew in importance. In some parts of the manor, coal seams were so close to the surface they were often ploughed up, and numerous small workings developed. Pits developed throughout the Manor, with those in Swanwick and Alfreton being the most productive. Alfreton colliery was sited to the northeast of the town. Ropemaking was allied to this industry, and the locality became famous for the quality of its ropes. In the 18th century Alfreton was the chief coal mining centre in Derbyshire, and the third-largest town in the county. The pits closed in the late 1960s and their sites have been reclaimed for other development.

Local iron working began in the low-lying land to the south of the current town in the vicinity of the A61, where a dam was made to power a water mill. This would have been quite a small operation, along with another at Lower Birchwood, and it was not until the 18th century that iron working was expanded into major enterprises, centred on Riddings and Butterley, south and southeast of the manor.

The growth of these industries grounded the area&#x27;s prosperity and attracted huge numbers of workers in the 19th century, rapidly swelling the local population. The extensive brick terraced housing in the area dates to this period, and brickmaking and tilemaking were significant local industries. Bootmaking and repairing, and tanning of leather, were also substantial employers due to the need for footwear for these heavy industries. According to Census figures, in 1801 the population of the area that would become the Urban District stood at 2,301, rising to 21,232 in 1931. It has remained within about 3,000 of that number ever since.

After the closure of the pits and Riddings Ironworks in the 1960s, local employment shifted to factory, retail, and service enterprises, many of which grew up on industrial estates occupying formerly despoiled colliery lands. Initially only a few major employers were present, such as Aertex and English Rose, but this changed with the development of several industrial estates to the east of the town.

The development of transport in the area followed much the same pattern as elsewhere in England, with roads being vastly improved by turnpiking from the late 18th century onwards. Turnpike Acts affecting the area were obtained in 1759, 1764 (amended in 1790 and 1812), 1786, and 1802. These provided Alfreton with good road links to Derby, Nottingham, Mansfield, Chesterfield, and the High Peak. The town became a coaching centre, which accounts for the inordinate number of inns that were formerly in the vicinity of the market place. A legal requirement on turnpike companies to provide milestones resulted in a local curiosity, a cast-iron marker on the town crossroads with the notation &#x27;Alfreton 0 Miles&#x27;. Around the same time as turnpikes were introduced the coal and iron industries benefited from the building of canals in the southern and eastern parts of the area. The Cromford Canal, built in 1793, had a 3,000 yard-long tunnel. In the 19th century, coaching and canal transport were rendered increasingly obsolete by railways built to the east of the town and along the eastern and southern boundaries of the former manor. As canals fell into disuse, road and rail transport burgeoned. Rail transport temporarily declined in the 1960s when Alfreton station was closed due to the Beeching cuts, before being reopened in May 1973.

Alfreton Hall, the successor to the original manor house, was built c.1750, with an additional wing added c.1850; it is now a conference centre and restaurant. Alfreton House just off the High Street dates from c.1650 and is now occupied by the Town Council. The former George Inn at the top of King Street dates back to the 18th century and was used as the meeting place for the local Turnpike Trust and local Assizes. On the west side of the southern approach to Alfreton is a small and distinctive stone-roofed building known as the &#x27;House of Confinement&#x27;. This was built in the 1840s and was the local jail. There are also several churches, the oldest of which is St. Martin&#x27;s at the west end of the town, part of which dates back to 1200. Beyond the town but within the ancient Manor are Carnfield Hall (15th century, now a private residence and events venue), Riddings House (now a nursing home), Swanwick Hall (c.1772, now a school), Swanwick Old Hall (1678, private residence), The Hayes (c.1860, now a conference centre), Newlands House (19th century, now flats), and the Jessop Monument (1854) at Ironville.

==Economy==
The main industry of Alfreton was historically coal mining but after the mines closed in the 1960s it changed to light industry, warehousing, retailing, and the service sector. A substantial proportion of local jobs are in health, education, and leisure. A significant but declining proportion of the area is still agricultural. Alfreton town centre features a number of national chain stores, along with independent businesses and charity shops, but it is dominated by a large branch of Tesco. There are several banks, building societies, estate agents, and other services. There is an indoor market, library, two post offices, a job centre, and numerous pubs and food outlets. There is a health centre, a leisure centre, swimming pool and park at the west end of the town, and a golf course outside the town to the west.

The chocolate company Thorntons, women&#x27;s fashion company David Nieper and safety footwear manufacturer Rock Fall are based in Alfreton.

==Transport==
The area has a heavily used and extensive road network, in particular the arterial A61 and A38, the latter linking to the nearby junction 28 of the M1 motorway. The town grew as a centre for bus transport throughout the 20th century and still has extensive bus services. Alfreton&#x27;s railway station, sited northeast of the town, was originally closed in 1967 as part of the Beeching Axe, but in 1973 a station was opened on the same site named Alfreton and Mansfield Parkway, as the nearby town of Mansfield did not have its own station at this time. When Mansfield regained its own station as part of the Robin Hood Line reopenings in the 1990s, the station&#x27;s name reverted to Alfreton. From May 2021, the station lost all direct services to and from London, though a campaign to have some reinstated has the support of the Town Council. An hourly service also runs to Liverpool and Norwich, and between Leeds and Nottingham.

==Geography==
Alfreton is from the border with Nottinghamshire and lies near the towns of Kirkby-in-Ashfield , Sutton-in-Ashfield and Mansfield . The towns of Clay Cross and Ripley are also nearby. Chesterfield is north of Alfreton.

==Politics==
Alfreton is part of the Amber Valley constituency; the Member of Parliament (MP) is Linsey Farnsworth (Labour). The local council for Alfreton is Amber Valley Borough Council.

==Education==
The local secondary school is David Nieper Academy. Before September 2008 the school was known as Mortimer Wilson School for many decades. In September 2017 it became David Nieper Academy, after the clothing line that now owns it.

Two schools for children aged 4–6 are called Copthorne Infant School and Croft Infant School. Leys Junior School, on Flowery Leys Lane, and Woodbridge Junior school, which shares the Alfreton Grange site on Grange Street, provide for children aged 7–11.

There is also a Roman Catholic school named Christ the King on Firs Avenue, for children 4–11, as well as an adjoining nursery for children 2–4

<doc id="350499" wikidata="Q1343198" url="?curid=350499" title="William Willett">
<text>William Willett (10 August 1856 – 4 March 1915) was a British builder and a promoter of British Summer Time.

==Biography==
Willett was born in Farnham, Surrey, and educated at the Philological School. After some commercial experience, he entered his father&#x27;s building business, Willett Building Services. Between them they created a reputation for &quot;Willett built&quot; quality houses in choice parts of London and the south, including Chelsea and Hove, including Derwent House. He lived most of his life in Chislehurst, Kent, where, it is said, after riding his horse in Petts Wood near his home early one summer morning and noticing how many blinds were still down, the idea for daylight saving time first occurred to him.

This was not the first time that the idea of adapting to daylight hours had been mooted, however. It was common practice in the ancient world, and in 1784 a light-hearted satire by Benjamin Franklin resulted in resurrecting the idea. Although Franklin&#x27;s suggestion was simply that people should get up earlier in summer, he is often erroneously attributed as the inventor of DST while Willett is often ignored. Modern DST was first proposed by New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson, although many publications incorrectly credit Willett.

Using his own financial resources, in 1907 William published a pamphlet &quot;The Waste of Daylight&quot;. In it he proposed that the clocks should be advanced by 80 minutes in four incremental steps during April and reversed the same way during September. The evenings would then remain light for longer, increasing daylight recreation time and also saving £2.5 million in lighting costs. He suggested that the clocks should be advanced by 20 minutes at a time at 2 am on successive Sundays in April and be reversed in September.


Through vigorous campaigning, by 1908 Willett had managed to gain the support of a member of parliament (MP), Robert Pearce, who made several unsuccessful attempts to get it passed into law. A young Winston Churchill promoted it for a time, and the idea was examined again by a parliamentary select committee in 1909 but again nothing was done. The outbreak of the First World War made the issue more important primarily because of the need to save coal. Germany had already introduced the scheme when the bill was finally passed in Britain on 17 May 1916 and the clocks were advanced by an hour on the following Sunday, 21 May, enacted as a wartime production-boosting device under the Defence of the Realm Act. It was subsequently adopted in many other countries.

William Willett did not live to see daylight saving become law, as he died of influenza in 1915 at the age of 58. He is commemorated in Petts Wood by a memorial sundial, set permanently to daylight saving time. The Daylight Inn in Petts Wood is named in his honour as is the road Willett Way. His house in Chislehurst is marked with a blue plaque. He is buried in St Nicholas&#x27; Churchyard, Chislehurst, although a memorial to his family stands in the churchyard at St Wulfran&#x27;s Church, Ovingdean, in Brighton and Hove.

===Freemason===
Willett was initiated into Camden Place Lodge on 1 November 1906.

===Family===
William Willett married twice, firstly in 1879 to Maria Mills (died 1905), with whom he had seven children; secondly in 1910 to Florence Strickland, with whom he had one daughter.

Willett was the grandfather of John Willett, translator of Bertolt Brecht, and is a great-great-grandfather of Coldplay singer Chris Martin.

<text>Antony Gordon Hawksworth MBE (born 27 February 1960), known professionally as Tony Hawks, is a British comedian and author.

==Early life==
Born in Brighton, Sussex, Hawks was educated at Brighton, Hove and Sussex Grammar School and Brighton College.

==Career==
After dropping out of a drama degree at Manchester University, Hawks appeared in the West End musical &quot;Lennon – A Musical Biography&quot; at The Astoria. By 1988, before he found chart success, he was already appearing in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Big Fun Show&quot; with Paul Merton, John Irwin and Josie Lawrence.

Hawks first attempted to break into show business as a singer-songwriter, but it was with a novelty record that he had his first brush with fame; as leader of the trio Morris Minor and the Majors, he reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart with the Beastie Boys parody, &quot;Stutter Rap (No Sleep til Bedtime)&quot; in 1988. It went on to sell 220,000 copies, and reached a peak of No. 2 in Australia. The follow-up, a pastiche of Stock Aitken Waterman titled &quot;This Is the Chorus&quot;, fared less well. A television series followed from this, &quot;Morris Minor&#x27;s Marvellous Motors&quot;, written by and starring Hawks. In it, the fictional bandleader attempted to maintain his pop career while running a garage; it ran for one series in 1989 on BBC1.

Hawks performs stand-up comedy, and is a regular on television and radio panel games in the UK, including &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, although he first came to prominence as one of two resident performers – the other was Jo Brand — on the BBC monologue show &quot;The Brain Drain&quot;.

In the first few series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Hawks performed a warm-up act for the live audience before recording began. Hawks has also appeared in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in a number of supporting roles, on several occasions as a voice artist for intelligent machines. Hawks provided the voice of a vending machine in &quot;Future Echoes&quot; and &quot;Waiting for God&quot; and the voice of a suitcase in &quot;Stasis Leak&quot;; later, he appeared on screen as The Guide in &quot;Better Than Life&quot;, The Compere in &quot;Backwards&quot;, and Caligula in &quot;Meltdown&quot;. On 29 May 2009, Hawks featured in an episode of &quot;Carpool&quot;, with his &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; co-star Robert Llewellyn. Craig Charles stated that Hawks was called the 4th/5th &#x27;Dwarfer&#x27; due to his many appearances on the series. Hawks also provided the voice-over for a restaurant advertisement in the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; episode &quot;Me²&quot;, although this role was uncredited.

He has appeared as a pundit in the television series &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; and as a contestant on the BBC quiz show &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;.

In November 2010, he was a guest on a number of television and radio programmes to discuss the film version of his book &quot;Round Ireland with a Fridge&quot;, including Simon Mayo&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Scotland. He was also a contestant on a special edition of &quot;Mastermind&quot; for Children in Need, and featured as part of Comic Relief in 2011.

In March 2011, Hawks travelled to Japan to appear at the Okinawa International Movie Festival where &quot;Round Ireland with a Fridge&quot; was nominated for Best Comedy. In late 2011, he completed his first national theatre tour for a decade, taking his one-man show, &#x27;Random Fun&#x27; to 30 towns and cities around the UK. He was also a guest on many television and radio series during the tour, including &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; and &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;.

In August 2013, Hawks - along with many other comedians - appeared in the television adaptation of the radio series &quot;Just a Minute&quot; for its 45th anniversary.

==Books==
Hawks has written seven books:
* &quot;Round Ireland with a Fridge&quot;: His first book was an account of his attempt to hitchhike around Ireland with a fridge to win a bar bet. It sold over 800,000 copies.
* &quot;Playing the Moldovans at Tennis&quot;: His second book, also the result of a drunken bet (with the comedian Arthur Smith), this time involved an attempt to beat each member of the Moldova national football team in a game of tennis, based on the theory that people good at one sport are not necessarily good at others.
* &quot;One Hit Wonderland&quot;: His third book describes his attempt, over 10 years after his first, to write a second hit song. This culminates in him performing on Albanian television with Norman Wisdom and Tim Rice.
* &quot;A Piano in the Pyrenees: The Ups and Downs of an Englishman in the French Mountains&quot;: An account of his purchase of a house in the Pyrenees in the south of France, after deciding that the two things he wanted in life were to meet his soulmate, and to purchase an &quot;idyllic house abroad somewhere abroad&quot;.
* &quot;The Fridge Hiker&#x27;s Guide to Life&quot;.
* &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West...Country&quot;
* &quot;The A to Z of Skateboarding&quot;. For more than twenty years, Tony Hawks has been mistaken for Tony Hawk, the American skateboarder. Even though it is abundantly clear on his website that he is an English comedian and author, people still write to him asking the best way to do a kickflip or land a melon and the new book contains his responses.

Hawks has also contributed to the collection &quot;The Weekenders: Travels in the Heart of Africa&quot;.

==Film adaptations==
The full-length feature film version of his book &quot;Round Ireland with a Fridge&quot;, starring Hawks, Josie Lawrence, Ed Byrne and Sean Hughes, was released in 2010. The film was shot in London, west Wales, the Surrey Hills and Ireland in 2009. It was directed by Ed Bye and the producers were Tony Hawks, Simon Sharkey and Greg Macmanus, the cinematographer was John Sorapure and the film editor was Mark Wybourn. The film premiered at the Cambridge Film Festival and was released on DVD on 8 November 2010.

&quot;Playing the Moldovans at Tennis&quot; was released in 2012 and starred Hawks with Anatol Durbala, Steven Frost, Angus Deayton, Morwenna Banks and Laura Solon, with Pat Cash as the commentator. It was co-directed by Hawks and Mikolaj Jaroszewicz, cinematographer on the Oscar-winning &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, and edited by Christopher White. Production design was by Edward Lidster and Vlad Lozovan, sound by Ludovic Lassare and lighting by Tim Jordan. It was the first British feature film to be made in Moldova, with additional filming in London, Belfast and Israel, and it premiered with a special charity screening at the Odeon West End in Leicester Square on 21 June 2012.

==Theatre==
Hawks appeared in two West End productions in the 1980s as an actor/musician, &quot;Pump Boys and Dinettes&quot; and &quot;Lennon&quot;. He also acted in &quot;A Slight Case of Murder&quot; at The Nottingham Playhouse and in The Dice House at The Belgrade Theatre in Coventry.

He was a finalist for three consecutive years in the 1980s for the Vivian Ellis prize for Young Composers for the Musical Stage.

Hawks staged a special charity performance of his comedy musical &quot;Midlife Cowboy&quot; at the Lyric Theatre in London on 25 April 2016. It starred Hawks, Jack Dee, Doon Mackichan, Ben Miller, Alistair McGowan and Charlotte Page. Proceeds from the performance were donated to the Tony Hawks Care Home in Moldova. The full-length version of &quot;Midlife Cowboy&quot; opened at the Pleasance Theatre in London on 13 September 2019 starring Hawks, Debra Stephenson, Duncan Wisbey, James Thackeray and Georgina Fields.

==Other activities==
Hawks donated half of the royalties from his book &quot;Playing the Moldovans at Tennis&quot; to a trust fund for Moldova, which was used to open the Hippocrates Centre, a medical centre that provides rehabilitative therapy for disabled children from socially vulnerable families. Hawks continues to support Hippocrates through fundraising and personal involvement and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours &#x27;for services to disadvantaged children in Moldova&#x27;. All profits from sales of the film also go to the centre. Proceeds from the film version of &quot;Playing the Moldovans at Tennis&quot; also go to the Care Home.

Hawks is the co-founder and public face of the &#x27;Tennis for Free&#x27; campaign which aims to make Britain&#x27;s existing municipal tennis facilities available to all.

Hawks won the British Actors Equity Tennis Tournament for three years running and collaborated with Chesney Hawkes between 2013 and 2018 on various songs available from a MySpace website.

Hawks is frequently confused with American professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, largely because the latter&#x27;s video game franchise uses the possessive apostrophe (&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot;). Hawks maintains a list of emails intended for the skateboarder, and his mischievous responses to them, on his website. On 2 January 2008, he appeared on an edition of &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, with Tony Hawk as his chosen specialist subject. Hawks noted that his correspondents &quot;might be able to do backside varials but they can&#x27;t spell to save their lives&quot;.

<text>Samuel Jordan Kirkwood (December 20, 1813 – September 1, 1894) was an American politician who twice served as governor of Iowa, twice as a U.S. Senator from Iowa, and as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior.

==Early life and career==

Samuel Jordan Kirkwood was born on December 20, 1813, in Harford County, Maryland. At age 17, he began teaching school and had as one of his pupils his cousin Daniel Kirkwood, who later achieved prominence as a mathematician and astronomer. Samuel spent part of his youth in Washington, D.C., then joined his father in moving to Ohio in 1835. There he became a well-known anti-slavery Democrat. He was elected to several state offices and worked closely with Thomas Bartley, the future governor of Ohio, in the 1840s.
In 1855 Kirkwood moved to Iowa, living northwest of Iowa City, and became involved with the Clark family, also from Ohio, in a milling venture, and then with the Clark and Lucas families in land speculation. Kirkwood married Jane Clark, the sister of Phoebe Ann Clark, and thus became the brother-in-law of Edward Lucas, son of Iowa&#x27;s first Territorial Governor Robert Lucas and his second wife Friendly Ashley (Sumner) Lucas.

Although Kirkwood intended to leave politics behind him in Iowa, he took an interest in the newly founded Republican Party. Summoned from his mill at Coralville and still coated in flour dust, Kirkwood gave a rousing speech at the founding meeting of the Iowa Republican Party in February 1856. Many people credited Kirkwood’s speech and subsequent work with the success of the Republican Party in Iowa; that year he was elected to the Iowa Senate serving from 1856 to 1859.

==Governorship: Coppock incident and the Civil War==
In 1859, Kirkwood was nominated for governor and defeated Augustus C. Dodge after a bitter campaign which focused on the slave issue. In 1860, Kirkwood’s first year in office, the John Brown raid on Harpers Ferry further polarized the nation over slavery, and Kirkwood was clearly on the side of the militant abolitionists. When Barclay Coppock, a youth from Springdale, who was part of Brown’s raid, fled to Iowa, Kirkwood refused to accept extradition papers for him from Virginia, and allowed Coppock to escape.

During the Civil War, Kirkwood gained national attention for his extraordinary efforts to secure soldiers and supplies from Iowa for the Union Army. A strong supporter of President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s policies during the American Civil War, he was active in raising and equipping dozens of regiments for the Union Army.

In 1862, he attended the Loyal War Governors&#x27; Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, which ultimately gave Lincoln support for his Emancipation Proclamation.

==Senate and Secretary of the Interior==

After he left office in 1864, Kirkwood moved to a new house on Wyoming Road in Iowa City (now Kirkwood Avenue) and practiced law. About this time Kirkwood sold his share of the mill, part of it to his brother, William, and part to Valentine Miller. In 1865-1867, he served the remainder of James Harlan’s term in the U.S. Senate, and served in the Senate again from 1877 to 1881. Between his separate terms as a Senator, he was again the Governor of Iowa from 1876 to 1877. He resigned as governor in 1877 to begin his second term as U.S. Senator. In 1881, Kirkwood resigned his Senate seat to become Secretary of the Interior under President James A. Garfield, a position he would continue to serve in under President Chester A. Arthur after the Assassination of President Garfield. He served as Interior Secretary until 1882. He unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 1886.

Kirkwood died on September 1, 1894, in Iowa City, and is buried in Oakland Cemetery.

<text>Ampthill () is a town and civil parish in the Central Bedfordshire district of Bedfordshire, England. It lies between Bedford and Luton. At the 2021 census it had a population of 8,825.

==History==
The name &#x27;Ampthill&#x27; is of Anglo-Saxon origin. The first settlement was called &#x27;Æmethyll&#x27;, which literally means either &#x27;anthill&#x27; or &#x27;ant-infested hill&#x27;. In the Domesday Book, Ampthill is referred to as &#x27;Ammetelle&#x27;, with the landholder in 1086 being Nigel de la Vast. The actual entry reads: &quot;Ammetelle: Nigel de la Vast from Nigel d&#x27;Aubigny.&quot; A further variation may be &#x27;Hampthull&#x27;, in 1381.

In 1219 King Henry III granted a charter for a weekly market to be held on a Thursday. In 2019 the market celebrated 800 years.

Henry VIII was a frequent visitor to Ampthill Castle, and it was there that Catherine of Aragon lived from 1531 until divorced in 1533, when she was moved to Kimbolton. The castle was built in the 15th century by Sir John Cornwall, later Lord Fanhope, from ransoms after the Battle of Agincourt. Today a park remains just north of the town centre, site of Ampthill&#x27;s former castle, where Henry VIII would come and hunt. It was in the castle&#x27;s Great Dining Room that Queen Catherine defiantly received news of the end of her marriage. A cross erected in the 1770s marks the site of this important building which is set within Ampthill Great Park, a &quot;Capability&quot; Brown landscape.

In 1542 an Act of Parliament created the &#x27;Honour of Ampthill&#x27;, an area of 45 parishes around the town, including 11 in Buckinghamshire, in which the crown owned extensive property and the manorial rights. The Honour was sold to the Dukes of Bedford in parts between 1730 and 1881.

In the mid-1780s, John Fitzpatrick, the 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory, led a campaign to improve the town centre. He created the current market place, erected the water pump and built a new clock tower. Lord Upper Ossory was also responsible for a cross commemorating Catherine of Aragon, with an inscription by Horace Walpole, and a row of thatched cottages built between 1812 and 1816 to house his estate workers.

On the death of Lord Upper Ossory in 1818, Ampthill Park became the seat of Lord Holland in whose time Holland House in Kensington, London, became famous as a gathering place for intellectuals. Lady Holland planted trees to create the Alameda walk, inspired by the Almeida in Madrid. Ampthill Park was later home to Baron Ampthill.

In 1835 Ampthill became the centre of a Poor Law Union, and a workhouse was built on Dunstable Street shortly afterwards to serve the town and surrounding parishes.

The London and North Western Railway&#x27;s Bedford Railway branch line opened in 1846, with a station at Millbrook, three miles north-west of Ampthill. At different times this station was known as &quot;Ampthill&quot;, &quot;Ampthill (Marston)&quot; and &quot;Millbrook for Ampthill&quot;, before the name was changed to &quot;Millbrook&quot; in 1910. In 1868 the Midland Railway opened its main line from the Midlands to London. In order to cross the ridge of high ground on which Ampthill stands, the Ampthill Tunnel was built to the west of the town. Ampthill railway station was built to the south of the tunnel, at the bottom of the hill and over a mile from the market place. This station closed in 1959.

During WWII there was a farming camp near Ampthill where volunteers recovered sugarbeet and were accommodated in tents in the grounds of a nearby country mansion.

Recent years have witnessed substantial development in Ampthill and the surrounding area. The former site of the old Ampthill Brewery in Bedford Street area was substantially redeveloped in 2006/2007, with the demolition of a Shell petrol station, shopping arcade and small Budgens supermarket, to make way for a new Waitrose supermarket, an improved town car park and a development of shops and apartments known as Oxlet House. The supermarket opened on 29 September 2006, with Oxlet House being completed in late 2007. Since then, two major new housing estates have been constructed on the south side of town - Ampthill Heights to the west and Ampthill Gardens to the east. Other significant housing developments have been completed behind The Limes, at the former site of Russell House, off Swaffield Close and in the old orchard off Church Street. A microbrewery reviving the name of the Ampthill Brewery was started in 2014 on the Ampthill industrial estate but ceased operations the following year.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Ampthill, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Ampthill Town Council and Central Bedfordshire Council. The town council has its headquarters at Park Lodge in Ampthill Great Park, off Woburn Street.

===Administrative history===
Ampthill was an ancient parish. Until 1893 it was governed by its vestry and manorial courts. In 1893 it was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. The board held its first meeting on 14 April 1893 at the town&#x27;s courthouse on Church Street, which had been built in the 1860s.
Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894. The urban district council continued to meet at the courthouse until 1920, when it moved its meetings to a room at the town&#x27;s fire station at 10 Bedford Street, which had been built in 1902. After a new fire station was built in Oliver Street in 1954, the council converted the rest of the old fire station into its offices.
Ampthill Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It merged with four other districts to become Mid Bedfordshire. The new district council had one of its main offices in the town at the former Ampthill Rural District Council&#x27;s headquarters at 12 Dunstable Street. A successor parish of Ampthill was created in 1974 for the former urban district, with its council taking the name Ampthill Town Council.
Mid Bedfordshire and Bedfordshire County Council were both abolished in 2009, since when Ampthill has formed part of the unitary authority of Central Bedfordshire.

==Economy==
Ampthill is a commercial centre for surrounding villages; it has several pubs, restaurants, a Waitrose supermarket and a selection of small independent specialist shops. A number of small businesses such as solicitors, estate agents, financial services, hairdressers, are also located in town, with larger businesses found on the commercial and industrial developments on the outskirts, along the town&#x27;s bypass.

Ampthill is one of the most expensive places to buy a house in Bedfordshire, even in comparison with other mid-Bedfordshire towns such as neighbouring Flitwick, and Cranfield. In a survey, it was found that the majority of Ampthill&#x27;s workers are employed locally, with around 20% working in Ampthill itself, and most of the remainder travelling to nearby centres of employment such as Bedford, Luton and Milton Keynes. Around 13% of workers commute from Ampthill to London daily. The survey also found that the turnover of residents was low, most having been in Ampthill for well over a decade.

==Sport and leisure==
Ampthill has a non-League football team, Ampthill Town F.C. who play at Ampthill Park. Ampthill Super7s is the local 7-a-side football league. It takes place every Monday and Thursday at Redborne Upper School. The town&#x27;s rugby union club Ampthill RUFC was established in 1881 and plays in the RFU Championship, the second from top-tier league in the English rugby union system and are thus one of the top 24 sides in the country. The Rugby Club has over 1000 registered members, fields teams from every age group from U6&#x27;s up to U18&#x27;s. They also have 2 ladies sides and 6 adult men sides. Ampthill Town Cricket Club has been established since 1890 and currently have teams playing in the Hertfordshire league and the Bedfordshire league putting out at least four teams on Saturdays and Sunday. They also host a Bedfordshire CCC match yearly and host an annual friendly game with London Zoo. Their home is in Ampthill Great Park with a clubhouse and scorebox near the west carpark.

Ampthill also has a very popular and active Bowls Club, off Brinsmade Road and accessed through the attractive Kings Arms Path Gardens. The club celebrated its centenary in 2019, and has a llama as its emblem, representing the zoo owned by club founder, Sir Anthony Wingfield. All ages and abilities welcomed.

The Greensand Ridge Walk and the Greensand Cycle Way pass through the lower end of the town.

There is a Center Parcs site at Warren Wood to the west of Ampthill.

==Culture and community==
Ampthill formerly hosted its own annual festival weekend in the summer. This event included two music events: a live rock music event &quot;AmpRocks&quot;, which hosted acts such as Razorlight and Toploader, and the &quot;Ampthill Park Proms&quot;, where classical music was performed by bands such as Ampthill Orchestra, Ampthill Band and Redborne Jazz Band from the local upper school. This event was held in Ampthill Great Park, where a temporary soundstage was erected to entertain local residents.

The event also included the Ampthill Gala, which began with a parade of floats around the town, built and staffed by people from the local schools and communities. The parade ended at Ampthill Cricket Club, located just outside of Ampthill Great Park, where a variety of stalls set up by local charities and businesses could be found, as well as a number of fairground attractions.

The Ampthill Festival was first held in 1981 and was held annually with some exceptions. In 2023 the event was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions and as a result the company behind the festival, Ampthill Festival CIC, entered administration due to a lack of funding and the event was permanently cancelled in 2024. 

The annual Remembrance Day parade takes place, commencing at St Andrews Church, passing through the town streets, down the Alameda walk to the Cenotaph war memorial. The parade includes marchers representing all the services and civilian organisations of Ampthill who each leave a wreath on the memorial. 

Ampthill has a high concentration of public amenities, including schools, doctors surgeries, a fire and ambulance station.

As part of Central Bedfordshire, Ampthill&#x27;s schools are organised in a three-tier system. There are two lower schools (Russell and The Firs), one middle school (Alameda) and one upper school, Redborne, which is shared with the neighbouring town of Flitwick.

===Cultural references===
Ampthill Park was the burial place for the golden hare in the Kit Williams treasure hunt &quot;Masquerade&quot; near the cross-shaped monument to Catherine of Aragon, at the precise spot touched by the tip of the monument&#x27;s shadow at noon on the day of either the March or September equinox.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the nearby Sandy Heath TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio on 95.5 FM, Heart East on 96.9 FM, In2beats on 106.5 FM, and Bedford Radio, a community based radio station which broadcast online.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Bedford Today (formerly Times &amp; Citizen).

==Transport==
Ampthill is located along the A507, which links to the M1 to the west and the A6 to the east.

Grant Palmer provides frequent bus services to Bedford and Flitwick, along with less frequent services to Milton Keynes, Dunstable, and several smaller villages surrounding the town.

The Bedfordshire Railway &amp; Transport Association is campaigning for the reopening of Ampthill railway station which closed in 1959. The nearest railway station is Flitwick railway station approximately 2.5 km (1.6 miles) south of Ampthill.

The nearest airport is London Luton Airport, which is accessible by Thameslink train via Flitwick to Luton Airport Parkway railway stations.

==Notable buildings==
===St Andrew&#x27;s Church of England===
The church of St Andrew ranges in date from Early English to Perpendicular. It contains a monument to Richard Nicolls (1624–1672), an Ampthill native, who, under the patronage of the Duke of York, brother to Charles II, to whom the king had granted the Dutch North American colony of New Netherland, received the submission of its chief town, New Amsterdam, in 1664, and became its first English governor, the town taking the name of New York. Nicolls perished in the action between the English and Dutch fleets at the Battle of Solebay off the Suffolk coast, and the cannonball which killed him is preserved on his tomb. The church also contains a ring of eight bells. There were six until 1981, when the two new bells were installed. Services run weekly, with Sung Eucharist at 9.30am and Evensong at 6.30pm on Sundays. The church has a regular 4-part choir, which has sung morning and evening services for over 100 years.

===Houghton House===

Houghton House was built in 1621 by Mary, Countess of Pembroke and sister of the poet Sir Philip Sidney. In 1675, the house may have provided the inspiration for &#x27;House Beautiful&#x27; in John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. It is thought that Bunyan&#x27;s work is loosely based on his own journey between Bedford and Luton, and the steep slope leading into Ampthill could have been the model for the &#x27;Hill of Difficulty&#x27;. Houghton House passed to the Duke of Bedford in 1738 and became a ruin after the removal of the roof in 1794.

==Notable people==

*Sir Anthony Wingfield (1857 - 1952) who lived in Ampthill House (demolished in 1953). Sir Anthony served as High Sheriff of Bedfordshire and was known for keeping a menagerie of animals including cheetas, sloth bears, barbary rams, llamas, ostriches and camels. In 1939, the outbreak of war necessitated the disposal of this private zoo and the animals were relocated to Whipsnade zoo which Sir Anthony had helped to establish a few years earlier. The site of Ampthill House was developed for housing along Church Avenue, with the site adjacent to the Wingfield Club of which Sir Anthony was President.

<doc id="350514" wikidata="Q492805" url="?curid=350514" title="Andover, Hampshire">
<text>Andover ( ) is a town in the Test Valley district of Hampshire, England. The town is on the River Anton, a major tributary of the Test, and lies alongside the major A303 trunk road at the eastern end of Salisbury Plain, west of the town of Basingstoke. It is from Winchester, north of Southampton and from London.

The town developed as a centre for grain milling and wool processing, and in the 20th century it took on a significant Armed Forces presence.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Andover&#x27;s name is recorded in Old English in 955 as &quot;Andeferas&quot;, and is thought to be of Celtic origin: compare Welsh &quot;onn dwfr&quot; = &quot;ash (tree) water&quot;. The first mention in history is in 950 when King Edred is recorded as having built a royal hunting lodge there. In 962 King Edgar called a meeting of the Saxon &#x27;parliament&#x27; (the Witenagemot) at his hunting lodge near Andover. Of more importance was the baptism, in 994, of a Viking king named &quot;Anlaf&quot; (allied with the Danish king, Sweyn Forkbeard). The identity of that man was either Olav Tryggvason (king of Norway) or Olof Skötkonung (king of Sweden). The baptism was part of a deal with the English king, Æthelred the Unready, whereby the Viking stopped ravaging England and returned home.

At the time of the Domesday Book (1086), &quot;Andovere&quot; had 107 adult male inhabitants and probably had a total population of about 500. It was a relatively large settlement; most villages had only 100 to 150 people. Andover had six watermills which ground grain to flour. The town&#x27;s relative isolation implies a market for grain and flour. In 1175 Andover bought a royal charter granting certain townspeople rights and forming a merchant guild which took over local governance (see ancient borough); guild members elected two officials (bailiffs) who ran the town. In 1201 King John gave the merchants the right to collect royal taxes in Andover themselves. In 1256 Henry III gave the townspeople the right to hold a court and try criminals for offences committed in Andover. Andover sent MPs to the parliaments of 1295 and 1302–1307. The town was ravaged by two serious fires, in 1141 and 1435. Andover remained a small market town. Processing wool appears to have been the main industry and street names in the area of the town known as &quot;Sheep Fair&quot; commemorate this. A weekly market, and an annual fair were held.
As well as the Church of St Mary, the town had a priory and a hospital run by monks, dedicated to St John the Baptist, and also a lepers hostel to St Mary Magdalene. In 1538 during the Reformation Henry VIII closed the priory and the hospital. In 1571 a free school for the boys of Andover was established in the grounds of St Mary&#x27;s Church. This in time became Andover Grammar School, and in the 1970s it became John Hanson Community School. The school has occupied various sites in the town over the course of its history and is currently located in Floral Way.

In 1599 the town received a new charter from Elizabeth I. The merchants guild was made a corporation and the number of annual fairs was increased from one to three. Like other towns Andover suffered from outbreaks of plague. There were outbreaks in 1603–1605, 1625–1626 and 1636.

===18th and 19th century===
During the 18th century, being on the main Exeter – Salisbury – London road, the place became a refuelling or overnight stop for stagecoaches and other passing trade. More than 30 coaches passed through the town each day. In 1789 a canal to Southampton was opened, though this was never a commercial success and closed in 1859. In 1836 the Borough established a small police force: for the most part two constables and a gaoler.

Andover was linked to Basingstoke and thus to London on its new railway to Salisbury (shortly thereafter to Exeter beyond) when Andover junction station was opened on 3 July 1854. A railway from the 1860s ran to Southampton, built on the bed of the canal, for about 100 years, until 1964. The land, together with the adjacent gasworks and P.M. Coombes woodyards, was then sold to the TSB Trust Company who later built their headquarters there. In 1883, Andover was linked to Swindon and destinations further north with the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway.

The population grew from 3,304 in 1801 to 5,501 in 1871. During the 19th century the town acquired all the usual additions: a theatre in 1803, gas street lighting in 1838, a fire station and cottage hospital in 1877, a swimming pool opened in 1885 and a recreation ground opened in 1887. A water company was formed in 1875 to provide piped water to the town and a system of sewers and drains was built in 1899–1902. The public library opened in 1897. Despite this burgeoning of the amenities of the town, in 1845–1846 a notorious scandal brought to light evidence of beatings, sexual abuse and general mistreatment of workhouse inmates by the overseers. The enquiry and public reaction led indirectly to the Poor Law Act, principally involving segregation of a now-obligatory infirmary for local people from the workhouse for the able-bodied, but also better governance. The town was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Reform Act 1835.
The woollen industry had declined but new industries took its place. Taskers Waterloo Ironworks opened at Anna Valley in 1809 and flourished. Many examples of the machinery produced by Taskers can be seen at the Milestones Museum in Basingstoke. Andover Guildhall, which enjoys a prominent location in the High Street, opened in 1825.

===Modern history===
====Employment====
The town&#x27;s largest employer is the Ministry of Defence. RAF Andover was opened on Andover Airfield, to the south of the town, during the First World War and became the site of the RAF Staff College.

In 1926, the Andover War Memorial Hospital was opened by Field Marshall Edmund Allenby. The hospital currently provides inpatient rehabilitation, day hospital services, a minor injury unit and an outpatient unit, and is operated by Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, with some services being provided by Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust.

In 1932, Andover gained a new industry when the printers for Kelly&#x27;s Directory moved to the town. Slowly the town grew from about 11,000 and by 1960 had a population of about 17,000, because already some Londoners were being housed in the first of the council houses and flats being constructed.

During the Second World War, the RAF Staff College was the headquarters of RAF Maintenance Command, and gained a unique place in British history, as the first British military helicopter unit, the Helicopter Training School, was formed in January 1945 at RAF Andover. The airfield is no longer in use although the RAF retains a link to the area through the presence of 1213 (Andover) Squadron, Air Training Corps. When the RAF left the site became the Headquarters of the Quartermaster General and later Logistics Executive.

In 2001, the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) was formed and Andover became one of its major sites. Since 2012, the site has been the home of Army Headquarters. The Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre is based locally at Amport House, as is the Army Air Corps Centre and the Museum of Army Flying at Middle Wallop.

Major industries include Twinings the tea and coffee firm, Ducal Pine Furniture (until they closed in 2003), Thomson International Publishers, who produce the Pitkin Guides to be found in many churches and other notable buildings, financial institutions such as Simplyhealth and Lloyds Banking Group, and the Stannah Group, whose HQ is also in the town. Among the proposals in the council&#x27;s Borough Local Plan 2006 are plans to develop the former site of RAF Andover to Class B1, B2 and B8 uses. This site has been partially developed and is named Andover Business Park. The business park currently houses a Co-op Food Distribution centre, Rich Foods Factory, Costa Coffee Drive Thru, Pure Gym, Travelodge and the Chalkhill Blue pub.

==== Housing ====
In the 1950s the Borough Council was approached to become an overspill town for London, to build houses and take people and industry relocated from the overcrowded capital. In 1961 a plan was drawn up to expand to a population of some 47,000 by 1982, with 9,000 new homes to be built.

The first new council houses were ready by 1954, and by 1981 the population had risen to 51,000. A bypass, industrial estates and a new shopping centre in the town centre, called the Chantry Centre, were all built and the town&#x27;s character changed completely.

====Arts and culture====
Andover has a purpose-built arts and entertainment venue owned &amp; managed by Test Valley Borough Council called The Lights. This hosts professional artists throughout the year. The venue has a 249 fully raked auditorium, a business suite, a dance studio and a craft studio. The Lights has attracted international artists such as Michael McIntyre.

The Town Museum (Andover Museum and Museum of the Iron Age), based in the former John Hanson Free School building, has a Museum of the Iron Age which was added in 1986 and houses the finds from excavations at nearby Danebury hillfort.

In 2021, Andover was named as the sexiest place in Britain.

====Politics====
Andover was the name of a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of England from 1295 to 1307, and again from 1586, then of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800, and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. It was a parliamentary borough, represented by two Members of Parliament (MPs) until 1868, and by one member from 1868 to 1885. The name was then transferred to a county constituency electing one MP from 1885 until 1918.

Currently, Andover is in the constituency of North West Hampshire, which since 2015 has been represented in the House of Commons by Kit Malthouse for the Conservatives.

When the Borough Council and Andover Rural District Council were abolished in the local government reorganisation of 1974, and replaced by Test Valley Borough Council (whose area extends south to the edge of Southampton), Andover became an unparished area, secularly, for 34 years. Andover Town Council was revived in May 2010, the townsfolk electing an initial 19 members, and since 2017 has included a Town Mayor.

==Transport==
===Bus===
Buses in Andover all service Andover, Hampshire Bus Station, with a majority using this as their end/start point.

Almost all areas of the town are served, and there are longer distance connections to the surrounding towns and villages. The majority of the buses in the town are operated by Stagecoach South, including inter-urban services to Basingstoke and Salisbury.

The Active8 service connects the smaller town of Tidworth with Andover and Salisbury, and is operated by both Stagecoach and Salisbury Reds, a brand of Go South Coast. This service is rare in Hampshire in that the operators provide a combined timetable and accept each other&#x27;s tickets.

In 2002 the town became part of the Cango community bus network.

===Railway===
Andover&#x27;s railway station is run by South Western Railway and is close to the town&#x27;s centre. Trains run to Salisbury, Yeovil Junction, Exeter St Davids, Basingstoke and London Waterloo (with a usual intermittent stop of Woking) and some stopping services to places such as Whitchurch.

In April 2017, the Department for Transport predicted that train journey times between Andover and London Waterloo would be reduced by nearly 20 per cent after awarding the South Western franchise to South Western Railway; journey times to/from Waterloo to be cut by about 11 to 13 minutes from late 2018.

Andover previously had a second station, Andover Town, in the town centre on the Andover to Redbridge Line. The line and the station closed to passengers in September 1964 as part of the Beeching Axe.

===Roads===
The A303, a main route from London to South West England, essentially bounds the town to the south. The M4 motorway, to the north, can be reached by way of the A34 trunk road, which continues to Birmingham; or via Marlborough, Wiltshire.

==Demographics==

Andover Radio is a community radio station on 95.9 MHz FM, first licensed in 2016. The Independent Local Radio station for the area is Greatest Hits Radio Berkshire &amp; North Hampshire, which broadcasts national and regional music programmes. The licence was first held by Andover Sound, then by The Breeze between 2012 and 2020. 

The weekly newspaper for the town and the surrounding area is the &quot;Andover Advertiser&quot;, founded in 1858 and now owned by Newsquest.

==Andover Vision==

Andover Vision is a partnership of Andover&#x27;s residents, community groups, business and public bodies. In April 2017, a strategy document set out the ambitions for the town and its future over the next 20 years. The strategy was shaped by local people through extensive consultation and brought together by the Vision partnership. The ambitions will influence how Andover manages the changing environment for the benefit of the whole community as well as providing a way in which local people can play an active role in the future of their town. The five themes for the Andover Vision are:
* Being part of a connected community
* Having a great green environment
* Being part of a thriving town centre
* Supporting business, jobs and skills in the town 
* Access to great health

Each of the ambitions has a set of &#x27;big ideas&#x27;. The big ideas describe what the partnership will work on together for the town and inform the projects that the partnership will take forward through its action plan. The document will also be used as a basis to attract new funding and new opportunities to the town and a guide for partners for their future policies and strategies relating to Andover.

The Vision supports a number of projects in the town, including The Town Mills Riverside Park and organised events such as the Christmas lights switch on, Four Fun Fridays in the summer and the Artisan Markets.

The previous 20-year Andover Vision Strategy, launched in 2005, delivered projects including The Lights Theatre, Odeon cinema, Andover Business Park, the Chapel Arts Centre and events such as the Graduation ceremonies.

==Mills and milling==

Watermills have formed an important part in Andover&#x27;s history. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded six mills.

Rooksbury Mill is one of the few surviving mill buildings in Andover. The existence of Rooksbury Mill is first recorded by name in the 17th century. Functioning as a flour mill, it has passed through a succession of owners. Milling ceased in the early 20th century, after which the mill building went through a series of uses including being used as a small theatre. Test Valley Borough Council sold the building in 2002, shortly after it had been devastated following an arson attack. The new owners, Anthony and Sarah de Sigley, restored the building in 2003, rebuilding much of the original structure.

A large flour mill, McDougalls, is close to the railway station.

<text>Belper () is a town and civil parish in the local government district of Amber Valley in Derbyshire, England, located about north of Derby on the River Derwent. Along with Belper, the parish includes the village of Milford and the hamlets of Bargate, Blackbrook, and Makeney.

As of the 2011 Census, the parish had a population of 21,823. Originally a centre for the nail-making industry since the Middle Ages, Belper expanded during the early Industrial Revolution to become one of the first mill towns with the establishment of several textile mills; as such, it forms part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site.

==History==


At the time of the Norman occupation, Belper was part of the land centred on Duffield held by the family of Henry de Ferrers. The Domesday Book of 1086 records a manor of &quot;Bradley&quot; which is thought to have stood in an area of town now known as the Coppice. At that time it was probably within the Forest of East Derbyshire which covered the whole of the county east of the Derwent. It was possibly appropriated by William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby at some time after it was disafforested in 1225 and became part of Duffield Frith.

The town&#x27;s name is thought to be a corruption of &quot;Beaurepaire&quot; – meaning beautiful retreat – the name given to a hunting lodge, the first record of which being in a charter of 1231. This would have been the property of Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster who died in 1296, the record of his estate mentioning &quot;a capital mansion&quot;. The chapel built at that time still exists. Originally consecrated in 1250 as the Chapel of St Thomas, it was rededicated to St John during the reign of King Henry VIII. St John&#x27;s Chapel is still in use today and is thought to be the oldest building still standing in Belper though it is now used for council meetings rather than church services.

The coal deposits of Derbyshire are frequently associated with ironstone within the clay substrate. Initially obtained from surface workings, it would later have been mined in shallow bell pits. It is thought that this was important for the de Ferrers family, who were ironmasters in Normandy. By the reign of Henry VIII Belper had grown to a substantial size. It is recorded that in 1609 fifty-one people died of plague. However, in a Parliamentary Commissioners&#x27; report of 1650 regarding Duffield and its chapelries, Belper is described as &quot;a hamlet appertaining to Duffield&quot;.

From at least the 13th century there were forges in the Belper and Duffield areas and iron-working became a major source of income, particularly nail making. By the end of the 18th century there were around 500 workshops in the town supplying nails to the newly built textile mills. The workshops were eventually superseded by machinery during the 19th century. Some of the nail-makers&#x27; houses are still in existence and form part of local tours of the town.

The industrialist Jedediah Strutt, a partner of Richard Arkwright, built a water-powered cotton mill in Belper in the late 18th century: the second in the world at the time. With the expansion of the textile industry Belper became one of the first mill towns. In 1784 Strutt built the North Mill and, across the road, the West Mill. In 1803 the North Mill was burnt down and replaced by a new structure designed to be fireproof. Further extensions followed, culminating in the East Mill in 1913 – a present-day Belper landmark. Although no longer used to manufacture textiles the mill still derives electricity from the river, using turbine-driven generators.

Strutt had previously patented his &quot;Derby Rib&quot; for stockings, and the plentiful supply of cotton encouraged the trade of framework knitting which had been carried on in the town and surrounding villages since the middle of the previous century. Mechanisation arrived about 1850, but by that time the fashion for stockings for men was disappearing. However elaborately patterned stockings, for ladies especially, were coming into vogue, and the output of the Belper &quot;cheveners&quot; was much in demand.

The construction of the North Midland Railway in 1840 brought further prosperity. Belper was the first place in the UK to get gas lighting, at a works erected by the Strutts at Milford. Demand was such that in 1850, the Belper Gas and Coke Company was formed, with a works in the present Goods Road. Electricity followed in 1922 from the Derby and Nottingham Electrical Power Company&#x27;s works at Spondon. The first telephones came in 1895 from the National Telephone Company. The end of the century also brought the motor car, CH218, owned by Mr. James Bakewell of The Elms being possibly the first.

Belper remained a textile and hosiery centre into the 20th century. Meanwhile, other companies were developing: iron founding led to Park Foundry becoming a leader in the solid-fuel central-heating market; Adshead and Ratcliffe had developed Arbolite putty for iron-framed windows; Dalton and Company, which had been producing lubricating oils, developed ways of recovering used engine oil proving useful during the Second World War. In 1938, A. B. Williamson had developed a substance for conditioning silk stockings; the introduction of nylon stockings after the Second World War seemed to make it redundant, but mechanics and fitters had discovered its usefulness in cleaning hands and it is still marketed by Deb Group as Swarfega.

==Government==
Before 1983 the town gave its name to the Belper constituency, which from 1945 to 1970 was the seat of George Brown, the deputy leader of the Labour Party.

Administratively, Belper town council manages first tier local government services, Amber Valley Borough and Derbyshire County councils providing successively higher level services.

In 2019, MP Pauline Latham (Conservative Party) was reelected as MP for mid-Derbyshire.

In 2024, MP Jonathan Davies (Labour Party) was elected for Mid-Derbyshire.

==Geography==

Belper is north of Derby and is in the valley of the River Derwent. The town had a population of 20,548 living in 8,790 households according to the 2001 census.

As well as Belper itself, the civil parish also includes the communities and hamlets of:

:* Bargate
:* Belper Lane End
:* Blackbrook
:* Broadholm
:* Far Laund
:* Farnah Green
:* Makeney
:* Milford
:* Mount Pleasant
:* Openwoodgate
:* White Moor
:* Wyver

===Blackbrook===
The hamlet of Blackbrook is located 2 miles (3 km) west of Belper on the A517 Ashbourne road.

===Openwoodgate===
The adjoining community of Openwoodgate lies to the east, 1 mile from the centre of Belper. A small eastern portion, centred around Openwood Road and the Kilburn Lane section of the A609 road, containing the historic Ireton Houses cottages, and bordered by the A38, is contained within Denby parish.

=== Wyver ===

This is a rural district lying west of the River Derwent and just north of Belper and Mount Pleasant. It contains a nature reserve on a nineteen-acre site. The nearby lane is part of the Derwent Valley Heritage Way. The reserve is placed on a reoccurring flood plain which makes it an attractive place for wildlife, especially wading birds.

=== Hills ===
Hillside is to the west of Belper Lane End, and contains the highest point of the parish at .

Firestone Hill is to the west of the town by the parish boundary at . Several masts for communications are positioned there.

Another local feature is Bessalone Hill at to the north. It also maintains radio masts.

Pinchom&#x27;s Hill is north of Bargate, by Sandbed Lane. It is in height.

== Economy ==
Belper&#x27;s economy was traditionally reliant on manufacturing industry and numerous goods were made in the town. Cotton spinning and textile production were major employers virtually for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The large East Mill and the smaller North Mill are now all that remain of the industry and are preserved as part of the Derwent Valley Mills world heritage site.

During the Second World War, Rolls-Royce based the Merlin aero engine design team and Robotham&#x27;s engine design division developing the Meteor tank engine at Belper. After the Second World War, J. W. Thornton, the chocolate maker, moved into the town from Sheffield, which helped to alleviate the employment problems arising from the contraction of the earlier industries. In 1985, the company relocated to a new site a few miles away in Swanwick.

Today, the main employment sectors are retail and services although some manufacturing industry remains. The main shopping area is centred on King Street and Bridge Street. The town has three supermarkets, the Co-operative, Morrisons and Aldi. There are two discount shops, Poundland and B&amp;M Bargains. There are smaller Tesco and Co-op supermarkets on the Whitemoor estate.

==Transport==

===Road===
The A6 is the major through-road of the town and runs parallel to the River Derwent to the west.

===Rail===
Belper railway station is situated on the Midland Main Line. Regular trains between Derby and Matlock on the Derwent Valley Line are almost the only services to stop there, although one main line service to and from Sheffield stops on weekdays at times designed to assist Belper residents working in Sheffield. The group &#x27;Friends of the Derwent Valley Line&#x27; are campaigning for more such services.

===Buses===
The town is served by regular bus services to Derby and surrounding towns and villages as well as longer routes to Manchester and London. The major operator is Trent Barton who operate the bus garage on Bridge Street.

==Religion==
The oldest church still used for its original purpose is the Belper Unitarian Church, built in 1788. The present Methodist church was opened on 28 June 1807 and was originally built to hold 1,400 worshippers.

St Peter&#x27;s Church, a prominent landmark in the town, was built in 1824 to replace the smaller 13th century St John&#x27;s Chapel which is now used as a town council and heritage chamber. A second Anglican church, Christ Church, was built in 1850. A local saying calls St Peter&#x27;s &quot;the low church in the high place&quot; and Christ Church &quot;the high church in the low place&quot; based on their different liturgical traditions. Belper&#x27;s churches are intertwined in a group known as &quot;Churches Together&quot; in which they work together on events etc. Belper&#x27;s Parish led by Rev. Ann Stratton consists of St. Peters&#x27; Church, St. Swithun&#x27;s Church, and St Mark&#x27;s Church.

The town is also home to Belper Baptist Church, a spiritualist, a Roman Catholic, Belper Congregational Church and a further Methodist church at Openwoodgate, as well as Belper Community Church which meets at Whitemoor Day Centre three times a month.

==Public services==
Babington Hospital provides health services to the local people.

The town has a fire station, with one fire engine crewed by retained personnel.

The judges stated &quot;Belper is blessed with a wonderful history as a World Heritage Site but has much to offer as a thriving market town as well.&quot; The judges felt that this outstanding application demonstrates how much more can be done to transform an outwardly successful town centre into a go-to destination for locals and visitors alike.&quot; Belper won against towns and high streets such as Brighton, Colwyn Bay and many other places. Belper won a further award in the Champion High Street category in 2019.

===Music===

Belper Singers are an experienced chamber choir of some 25 voices, who sing both sacred and secular works. They give about five performances a year, including singing in various cathedrals.

Belper is also home to a weekly folk club welcoming singers, instrumentalists, poets, readers and audience members. Two traditional dance teams make their home in the town: Heage Windmillers (rapper) and Makeney Morris (Cotswold morris).

Andy Sneap (born in Belper) is a Grammy-winning music producer, songwriter and guitarist with British heavy metal band Hell. He is one of the most active and successful music producers in the metal music genre, with over 100 albums produced at his Backstage Recording studios in the rural outskirts of the town.

===The Belper Moo===

The Belper Moo began in March 2020, in response to the nationwide lockdown prompted by the COVID-19 crisis. Started by Belper resident Jasper Ward, it was advertised on social media as a means of &#x27;fighting lockdown stress, boredom and loneliness&#x27;. At 6.30pm, every evening, Belper residents were encouraged to mimic a cow&#x27;s moo from their windows, doorways and gardens while following social distancing guidelines. The idea quickly caught the imagination of the people and Belper and spread rapidly around the town. Many residents fashioned their own devices for amplifying their moos, which became known as &#x27;Moocraphones&#x27;, &#x27;Didgerimoos&#x27;, Megamoophones&#x27; and &#x27;Saxamoophones&#x27;. Following coverage on BBC radio and on BBC Online, &#x27;The Moo&#x27; attracted media attention worldwide. Residents uploaded their &#x27;moos&#x27; to the internet and a number of creative responses followed including songs, craft projects and poems. By early May, The Belper Moo had been participated in by thousands of residents for over 50 days. The Moo was resurrected during the November 2020 lockdown.

===Pride in Belper===

Belper has an annual Pride event, supporting the LGBT community, usually the first Saturday in August. This started in 2019 and has grown into a large community event with a parade, music and arts activities.

===Belper Arts Trail===
The annual Belper Arts Trail is an artist led initiative which aims for artists to exhibit and promote their work. It began in 2014 when two artists wanted to help strengthen the local artistic community and to find interesting and creative solutions to the lack of dedicated space in Belper for artists to exhibit. Utilising every possible space as a venue over the Arts Trail weekend art can now be found in a variety of unusual spaces.
With Belper and Derbyshire overflowing with artistic talent it was felt that Belper really needed an interactive trail of creativity which has now grown each year to become a key Derbyshire event. The trail takes place annually over the May Day Bank Holiday.

=== Festivals ===
Belper has become well-known for its festivals with festivals such as &quot;Belper Goes Green&quot; (a musical event that aims to raise awareness of environmental problems and aims to share ways of reducing our impact on the planet), &quot;Belper Games&quot; (a festival where people compete in several challenges), &quot;Belper Food Festival&quot; (where stalls showcasing local business&#x27; food and dishes are put up around the town), and &quot;Belper Music Festival&quot; (where businesses have music on inside or outside their premises showing off local musicians and bands.) These events have become an annual occasion which help to boost the local economy throughout the town and support local small businesses.

==Education==

===Primary schools===
There are eight primary schools which feed the single secondary school:

* Holbrook Primary School;
* St Elizabeth&#x27;s Catholic Voluntary Academy;
* St John&#x27;s Church of England Primary School;
* Herbert Strutt Primary School;
* Pottery Primary School;
* Long Row Primary School;
* Ambergate Primary School;
* Milford Primary School.

===Secondary schools===
Belper School and Sixth Form Centre has approximately 1,400 pupils aged 11–18. It was originally named &quot;Belper High School&quot; when it was built in 1973, and is adjacent to Belper Leisure Centre. Famous people to have attended the school include Ross Davenport – winner of two swimming gold medals at the 2006 Commonwealth Games – and Alison Hargreaves, holder of a number of mountaineering records.
Herbert Strutt Grammar School was among the Strutt family&#x27;s bequests to the town. It became a middle school in 1973, with the opening of the new Belper High School, and latterly a primary school, in use as such until spring 2008 when it was replaced by a new building on a different site. Notable among its pupils were the actors Alan Bates and Timothy Dalton.

For a number of years from 1979, the innovative Rowen House School provided education on democratic principles. Also, during the 1970s and 1980s, Belper was the site of an experimental three-tier education system, comprising a number of primary schools (age 5–9 years, referred to as &quot;first&quot; schools), feeding into two main secondary schools (age 9–13 years, referred to as &quot;middle schools&quot;), pupils from both then usually attended a single American-style high school (age 13–18 years). In the mid-1980s, this scheme was abandoned, and the current two-tier system adopted. At the same time, one of the two secondary schools, Parks Secondary School, was closed down and the buildings, which were in a poor state of repair, demolished. In recent years, the site of the former Parks Secondary School has been used for a new school.

==International links==
Belper is twinned with Pawtucket, Rhode Island after Samuel Slater – an apprentice of Jedediah Strutt – went there and founded the American cotton spinning industry.

Belper made international news in 2001 after rejecting a gift of a large fibreglass Mr. Potato Head model from Pawtucket, as some residents considered it &quot;hideous&quot;. The statue was refurbished and returned in 2015, though opinion is still divided.

<text>Bourtange (; Gronings: &quot;Boertang&quot;) is a village with a population of 430 in the municipality of Westerwolde in the Netherlands. It is situated in the region Westerwolde in the east of the province of Groningen near the German border. Fort Bourtange was built in 1593 during the Dutch Revolt and was used until 1851. Between 1967 and 1992 the star fort was gradually restored to its mid-18th-century state and it is currently an open-air museum.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Bourtange&quot; comes from the Dutch word &quot;tange&quot; (sand ridge), because the settlement is situated on a strategically important sand ridge in the marshes of the Bourtange Moor.

==History==
Fort Bourtange was initially built during the Eighty Years&#x27; War (&quot;circa&quot; 1568–1648) when William I of Orange wanted to control the main road between Germany and the city of Groningen which was controlled by the Spanish. This road followed a sandy ridge (&quot;tange&quot;) through the marshes (the Bourtange Swamp).

Later, around 1594, Bourtange became part of the fortifications on the border between the northern provinces (Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe) and Germany.

Bourtange was a separate municipality until 1822, when it was merged with Vlagtwedde.

In 1851 the star fort was given up and Bourtange became a normal village.

Around 1960 living conditions in the village deteriorated and it was decided that Bourtange would be rebuilt to its state of 1740-1750. Today it is an open-air museum.

== Geography ==
Bourtange is located in the center of the municipality of Westerwolde and in the east of the province of Groningen near the German border. It is situated on a sand ridge in the Bourtange Moor, in the region of Westerwolde.

== Demographics ==
In 2001, the town of Bourtange had 267 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 0.21 km2, and contained 133 residences. In 2005, the statistical area &quot;Bourtange&quot;, which also can include the surrounding countryside, had a population of around 530.

As of 2012, Bourtange has a population of 430 and a population density of .
