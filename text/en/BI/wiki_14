<text>Robert Traill Spence Lowell IV (; March 1, 1917 – September 12, 1977) was an American poet. He was born into a Boston Brahmin family that could trace its origins back to the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. His family, past and present, were important subjects in his poetry. Growing up in Boston also informed his poems, which were frequently set in Boston and the New England region. The literary scholar Paula Hayes believes that Lowell mythologized New England, particularly in his early work.

Lowell stated, &quot;The poets who most directly influenced me ... were Allen Tate, Elizabeth Bishop, and William Carlos Williams. An unlikely combination! ... but you can see that Bishop is a sort of bridge between Tate&#x27;s formalism and Williams&#x27;s informal art.&quot; Lowell wrote in both formal, metered verse as well as free verse; his verse in some poems from &quot;Life Studies&quot; and &quot;Notebook&quot; fell somewhere in between metered and free verse.

After the publication of his 1959 book &quot;Life Studies&quot;, which won the 1960 National Book Award and &quot;featured a new emphasis on intense, uninhibited discussion of personal, family, and psychological struggles&quot;, he was considered an important part of the confessional poetry movement. However, much of Lowell&#x27;s work, which often combined the public with the personal, did not conform to a typical &quot;confessional poetry&quot; model. Instead, Lowell worked in a number of distinctive stylistic modes and forms over the course of his career.

He was appointed the sixth Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, where he served from 1947 until 1948. In addition to winning the National Book Award, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1947 and 1974, the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1977, and a National Institute of Arts and Letters Award in 1947. He is &quot;widely considered one of the most important American poets of the postwar era.&quot; His biographer Paul Mariani called him &quot;the poet-historian of our time&quot; and &quot;the last of [America&#x27;s] influential public poets.&quot;

==Life==
===Family history===

Lowell was born to United States Navy Cmdr. Robert Traill Spence Lowell III and Charlotte Winslow in Boston, Massachusetts. The Lowells were a Boston Brahmin family that included poets Amy Lowell and James Russell Lowell; clergymen Charles Russell Lowell Sr. and Robert Traill Spence Lowell; Civil War general and war hero Charles Russell Lowell III (about whom Lowell wrote his poem &quot;Charles Russell Lowell: 1835-1864&quot;); and the Federal Judge John Lowell.

His mother was a descendant of William Samuel Johnson, a signer of the United States Constitution; Jonathan Edwards, the Calvinist theologian (about whom Lowell wrote the poems &quot;Mr. Edwards and the Spider&quot;, &quot;Jonathan Edwards in Western Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;After the Surprising Conversions&quot;, and &quot;The Worst Sinner&quot;); Anne Hutchinson, the Puritan preacher and healer; Robert Livingston (who was also an ancestor on Lowell&#x27;s paternal side); Thomas Dudley, the second governor of Massachusetts; and &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers James Chilton and his daughter Mary Chilton. Lowell&#x27;s parents share a common descent from Philip Livingston, the son of Robert Livingston, and were sixth cousins.

As well as a family history steeped in Protestantism, Lowell had notable Jewish ancestors on both sides of his family, which he discusses in Part II (&quot;91 Revere Street&quot;) of &quot;Life Studies&quot;. On his father&#x27;s side, Lowell was the great-great-grandson of Maj. Mordecai Myers (father of Theodorus Bailey Myers, Lowell&#x27;s great-granduncle), a soldier in the War of 1812 and later mayor of Kinderhook and Schenectady; and on his mother&#x27;s side, he was descended from the German-Jewish Mordecai family of Raleigh, North Carolina, who were prominent in state affairs.

===Early years===
As a youth, Lowell had a penchant for violence and bullying other children.

Describing himself as an 8½-year-old in the prose piece &quot;91 Revere Street&quot;, Lowell wrote that he was &quot;thick-witted, narcissistic, thuggish&quot;. As a teenager, Lowell&#x27;s peers gave him the nickname &quot;Cal&quot; after both the villainous Shakespeare character Caliban and the tyrannical Roman emperor Caligula, and the nickname stuck with him throughout his life. Lowell later referenced the nickname in his poem &quot;Caligula&quot;, first published in his book &quot;For the Union Dead&quot; and later republished in a revised sonnet version for his book, &quot;Notebook 1967–1968&quot;.
Lowell received his high school education at St. Mark&#x27;s School, a prominent prep school in Southborough, Massachusetts. There he met and was influenced by the poet Richard Eberhart, who taught at the school, and as a high school student, Lowell decided that he wanted to become a poet. At St. Mark&#x27;s, he became lifelong friends with Frank Parker, an artist who later created the prints that Lowell used on the covers of most of his books.
Lowell attended Harvard College for two years. While he was a freshman at Harvard, he visited Robert Frost in Cambridge and asked for feedback on a long poem he had written on the Crusades; Frost suggested that Lowell needed to work on his compression. In an interview, Lowell recalled, &quot;I had a huge blank verse epic on the First Crusade and took it to him all in my undecipherable pencil-writing, and he read a little of it, and said, &#x27;It goes on rather a bit, doesn&#x27;t it?&#x27; And then he read me the opening of Keats&#x27;s &#x27;Hyperion&#x27;, the first version, and I thought all of that was sublime.&quot;

After two years at Harvard, Lowell was unhappy, and his psychiatrist, Merrill Moore, who was also a poet, suggested that Lowell take a leave of absence from Harvard to get away from his parents and study with Moore&#x27;s friend, the poet-professor Allen Tate who was then living in Nashville and teaching at Vanderbilt University.

Lowell traveled to Nashville with Moore, who took Lowell to Tate&#x27;s house. Lowell asked Tate if he could live with him and his wife, and Tate joked that if Lowell wanted to, Lowell could pitch a tent on Tate&#x27;s lawn; Lowell then went to Sears to purchase a tent that he set up on Tate&#x27;s lawn and lived in for two months. Lowell called the act &quot;a terrible piece of youthful callousness&quot;.

After spending time with the Tates in Nashville (and attending some classes taught by John Crowe Ransom at Vanderbilt), Lowell decided to leave Harvard. When Tate and John Crowe Ransom left Vanderbilt for Kenyon College in Ohio, Lowell followed them and resumed his studies there, majoring in Classics, in which he earned an A.B., &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year and was valedictorian of his class. He settled into the so-called &quot;writer&#x27;s house&quot; (a dorm that received its nickname after it had accrued several ambitious young writers) with fellow students Peter Taylor, Robie Macauley and Randall Jarrell.

Partly in rebellion against his parents, Lowell converted from Episcopalianism to Catholicism, and was for a time an editor at the Catholic publishing house Sheed &amp; Ward. He corresponded with literary critic, poet, and Catholic nun M. Bernetta Quinn. Lowell graduated from Kenyon in 1940 with a degree in Classics, he worked on a master&#x27;s degree in English literature at Louisiana State University and taught introductory courses in English for one year before the U.S. entered World War II.

===Political engagement===
Lowell was a conscientious objector during World War II and served several months at the federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut. He explained his decision not to serve in World War II in a letter addressed to President Franklin Roosevelt on September 7, 1943, stating, &quot;Dear Mr President: I very much regret that I must refuse the opportunity you offer me in your communication of August 6, 1943 for service in the Armed Force.&quot; He explained that after the bombing at Pearl Harbor, he was prepared to fight in the war until he read about the American terms of unconditional surrender that he feared would lead to the &quot;permanent destruction of Germany and Japan.&quot; Before Lowell was transferred to the prison in Connecticut, he was held in a prison in New York City that he later wrote about in the poem &quot;Memories of West Street and Lepke&quot; in his book &quot;Life Studies&quot;, inspired by a prison encounter with notorious gangster Lepke Buchalter.

While at Yaddo in 1949 Lowell became involved in the Red Scare and accused then director, Elizabeth Ames, of harboring communists and being romantically involved with another resident, Agnes Smedley. If Ames were not fired immediately, Lowell vowed to &quot;blacken the name of Yaddo as widely as possible&quot; using his connections in the literary sphere and Washington. The Yaddo board voted to drop all charges against Ames.

Lowell&#x27;s letter to the president was his first major political act of protest, but it would not be his last. During the mid to late 1960s, Lowell actively opposed the Vietnam War.

In response to American air raids in Vietnam in 1965, Lowell rejected an invitation to the White House Festival of the Arts from President Lyndon Johnson in a letter that he subsequently published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stating, &quot;We are in danger of imperceptibly becoming an explosive and suddenly chauvinistic nation, and may even be drifting on our way to the last nuclear ruin.&quot; Ian Hamilton notes that &quot;throughout [1967], [Lowell] was in demand as a speaker and petition signer [against the war]. He was vehemently opposed to the war, but equivocal about being identified too closely with the &#x27;peace movement&#x27;: there were many views he did not share with the more fiery of the &#x27;peaceniks&#x27; and it was not in his nature to join movements that he had no wish to lead.&quot; However, Lowell did participate in the October 1967 March on the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. against the war and was one of the featured speakers at the event. Norman Mailer, who was also a featured speaker at the rally, introduced Lowell to the crowd of protesters. Mailer described the peace march and his impression of Lowell that day in the early sections of his non-fiction novel &quot;The Armies of the Night&quot;.
Lowell was also a signer of the anti-war manifesto &quot;A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority&quot; circulated by members of the radical intellectual collective RESIST.

In 1968, Lowell publicly supported the Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president in a three-way primary against Robert F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. Lowell spoke at numerous fundraisers for McCarthy in New York that year, but &quot;[his] heart went out of the race&quot; after Robert Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.

===Teaching===
From 1950 to 1953, Lowell taught in the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, together with Paul Engle and Robie Macauley.
Later, Donald James Winslow hired Lowell to teach at Boston University, where his students included the poets Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. Over the years, he taught at a number of other universities including the University of Cincinnati, Yale University, Harvard University, and the New School for Social Research. Numerous poets, critics and scholars, including Kathleen Spivack, James Atlas, Helen Vendler, and Dudley Young, have written essays about Lowell&#x27;s teaching style and/or about his influence over their lives.

In 2012, Spivack also published a book, &quot;With Robert Lowell and His Circle&quot;, about her experience studying with Lowell at Boston University in 1959. From 1963 to 1970, Lowell commuted from his home in New York City to Boston to teach classes at Harvard.

Scholar Helen Vendler attended one of Lowell&#x27;s poetry courses and wrote that one of the best aspects of Lowell&#x27;s informal style was that he talked about poets in class as though &quot;the poets [being studied] were friends or acquaintances&quot;. Hamilton quoted students who stated that Lowell &quot;taught &#x27;almost by indirection&#x27;, &#x27;he turned every poet into a version of himself&#x27;, [and] &#x27;he told stories [about the poets&#x27; lives] as if they were the latest news.&#x27;&quot;

===Influences===
In March 2005, the Academy of American Poets named &quot;Life Studies&quot; one of their &quot;Groundbreaking Books&quot; of the 20th century, stating that it had &quot;a profound impact&quot;, particularly over the confessional poetry movement that the book helped launch. The editors of &quot;Contemporary Literary Criticism&quot; wrote that the book &quot;exerted a profound influence on subsequent American poets, including other first generation confessionalists such as Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton.&quot; In a 1962 interview, Sylvia Plath stated that &quot;Life Studies&quot; had influenced the poetry she was writing at that time (and which her husband, Ted Hughes, would publish posthumously as &quot;Ariel&quot; a few years later): &quot;I&#x27;ve been very excited by what I feel is the new breakthrough that came with, say, Robert Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Life Studies&quot;, this intense breakthrough into very serious, very personal, emotional experience which I feel has been partly taboo. Robert Lowell&#x27;s poems about his experience in a mental hospital, for example, interested me very much.&quot; In an essay published in 1985, the poet Stanley Kunitz wrote that &quot;Life Studies&quot; was &quot;perhaps the most influential book of modern verse since T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.&quot;

During the 1960s, Lowell was the most public, well-known American poet; in June 1967, he appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; as part of a cover story in which he was praised as &quot;the best American poet of his generation.&quot; Although the article gave a general overview of modern American poetry (mentioning Lowell&#x27;s contemporaries like John Berryman and Elizabeth Bishop), Lowell&#x27;s life, career, and place in the American literary canon remained the article&#x27;s focus.

===Relationships===

Lowell married the novelist and short-story writer Jean Stafford in 1940. Before their marriage, in 1938, Lowell and Stafford were in a serious car crash, in which Lowell was at the wheel, that left Stafford permanently scarred, while Lowell walked away unscathed. The impact crushed Stafford&#x27;s nose and cheekbone and required her to undergo multiple reconstructive surgeries. The couple had a tumultuous marriage—the poet Anthony Hecht characterized it as &quot;a tormented and tormenting one&quot;— that ended in 1948. Shortly thereafter, in 1949, Lowell married the writer Elizabeth Hardwick with whom he had a daughter, Harriet, in 1957. After Hardwick&#x27;s death in 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; would characterize the marriage as &quot;restless and emotionally harrowing,&quot; reflecting the very public portrait of their marriage and divorce as Lowell captured it in his books &quot;For Lizzie and Harriet&quot; and &quot;The Dolphin&quot;. After 23 years of marriage to Elizabeth Hardwick, in 1970, Lowell left her for Caroline Blackwood. Blackwood and Lowell were married in 1972 in England where they decided to settle and where they raised their son, Sheridan. Lowell also became the stepfather to Blackwood&#x27;s young daughter, Ivana, for whom he would write the sonnet &quot;Ivana,&quot; published in his book &quot;The Dolphin&quot;.

Lowell had a close friendship with the poet Elizabeth Bishop that lasted from 1947 until Lowell&#x27;s death in 1977. Both writers relied upon one another for critiques of their poetry (which is in evidence in their voluminous correspondence, published in the book &quot;Words in Air: the Complete Correspondence between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell&quot; in 2008) and thereby influenced one another&#x27;s work. Bishop&#x27;s influence over Lowell can be seen at work in at least two of Lowell&#x27;s poems: &quot;The Scream&quot; (inspired by Bishop&#x27;s short story &quot;In the Village&quot;) and &quot;Skunk Hour&quot; (inspired by Bishop&#x27;s poem &quot;The Armadillo&quot;), and the scholar Thomas Travisano notes, more broadly, that &quot;Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Life Studies&quot; and &quot;For the Union Dead&quot;, his most enduringly popular books, were written under Bishop&#x27;s direct influence.&quot;

Lowell also maintained a close friendship with Randall Jarrell from their 1937 meeting at Kenyon College until Jarrell&#x27;s 1965 death. Lowell openly acknowledged Jarrell&#x27;s influence over his writing and frequently sought out Jarrell&#x27;s input regarding his poems before he published them. In a letter to Jarrell from 1957, Lowell wrote, &quot;I suppose we shouldn&#x27;t swap too many compliments, but I am heavily in your debt.&quot;

===Mental illness===
Lowell was hospitalized many times throughout his adult life due to bipolar disorder, the mental condition then known as &quot;manic depression&quot;. On multiple occasions, Lowell was admitted to the McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, and one of his poems, &quot;Waking in the Blue&quot;, references his stay in this large psychiatric facility. While bipolar disorder was often a great burden to the writer and his family, it also provided the subject for some of Lowell&#x27;s most influential poetry, as in his book &quot;Life Studies&quot;. When he was fifty, Lowell began taking lithium to treat the condition. Saskia Hamilton, the editor of Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot;, notes, &quot;Lithium treatment relieved him from suffering the idea that he was morally and emotionally responsible for the fact that he relapsed. However, it did not entirely prevent relapses... And he was troubled and anxious about the impact of his relapses on his family and friends until the end of his life.&quot;

===Death===
Lowell died from a heart attack in a taxicab in Manhattan on September 12, 1977, at the age of 60, while on his way to see his ex-wife, Elizabeth Hardwick. He was buried in Stark Cemetery in Dunbarton, New Hampshire.

== Writing ==

===1940s===
Lowell&#x27;s early poetry was &quot;characterized by its Christian motifs and symbolism, historical references, and intricate formalism.&quot; His first three volumes were notably influenced by the New Critics, particularly Lowell&#x27;s former professors, John Crowe Ransom and Allen Tate.

Lowell&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;Land of Unlikeness&quot; (1944) was also highly influenced by Lowell&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism, leading Tate to call Lowell &quot;a Catholic poet&quot; in his introduction to the volume. The book was published by a small press as a limited edition, but still received some &quot;decent reviews&quot; from major publications like &quot;Poetry&quot; and &quot;Partisan Review&quot;.

In 1946, Lowell received wide acclaim for his next book, &quot;Lord Weary&#x27;s Castle&quot;, which included five poems slightly revised from &quot;Land of Unlikeness&quot; and thirty new poems. Among the better-known poems in the volume are &quot;Mr. Edwards and the Spider&quot; and &quot;The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket.&quot; &quot;Lord Weary&#x27;s Castle&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1947. That year, Lowell also was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship.

Randall Jarrell gave &quot;Lord Weary&#x27;s Castle&quot; high praise, writing, &quot;It is unusually difficult to say which are the best poems in &quot;Lord Weary&#x27;s Castle&quot;: several are realized past changing, successes that vary only in scope and intensity--others are poems that almost any living poet would be pleased to have written ... [and] one or two of these poems, I think, will be read as long as men remember English.&quot;

Following soon after his success with &quot;Lord Weary&#x27;s Castle&quot;, Lowell served as the Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress from 1947 to 1948 (a position now known as the U.S. Poet Laureate).

===1950s===
In 1951, Lowell published &quot;The Mills of the Kavanaughs&quot;, which centered on its epic title poem and failed to receive the high praise that his previous book had received. Although it received a generally positive review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Randall Jarrell gave the book a mixed review. Although Jarrell liked the shorter poems, he thought the epic title poem didn&#x27;t work, stating &quot;&quot;The people [in &#x27;The Mills of the Kavanaughs&#x27;] too often seem to be acting &quot;in the manner&quot; of Robert Lowell, rather than plausibly as real people act . . .I doubt that many readers will think them real.&quot; Following &quot;The Mills of the Kavanaughs&quot;, Lowell hit a creative roadblock and took a long break from publishing. However, by the end of the decade, he started writing again and changed stylistic direction with his next book of verse, &quot;Life Studies&quot; (1959), which won the National Book Award for poetry in 1960 and became the most influential book that Lowell would ever publish. In his acceptance speech for the National Book Award, Lowell famously divided American poetry into two camps: the &quot;cooked&quot; and the &quot;raw.&quot; This commentary by Lowell was made in reference to the popularity of Allen Ginsberg and the Beat Generation poets and was a signal from Lowell that he was trying to incorporate some of their &quot;raw&quot; energy into his own poetry.
The poems in &quot;Life Studies&quot; were written in a mix of free and metered verse, with much more informal language than he had used in his first three books. It marked both a turning point in Lowell&#x27;s career and a turning point for American poetry in general. Because many of the poems documented details from Lowell&#x27;s family life and personal problems, one critic, M. L. Rosenthal, labeled these poems &quot;confessional&quot; in a review of &quot;Life Studies&quot; that first appeared in &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine. Lowell&#x27;s editor and friend Frank Bidart notes in his afterword to Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems,&quot; &quot;Lowell is widely, perhaps indelibly associated with the term &#x27;confessional,&#x27;&quot; though Bidart questions the accuracy of this label. But for better or worse, this label stuck and led to Lowell being grouped together with other influential confessional poets like Lowell&#x27;s former students W. D. Snodgrass, Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton.

===1960s===
Lowell followed &quot;Life Studies&quot; with &quot;Imitations&quot; (1961), a volume of loose translations of poems by classical and modern European poets, including Rilke, Montale, Baudelaire, Pasternak, and Rimbaud, for which he received the 1962 Bollingen Poetry Translation Prize. However, critical response to &quot;Imitations&quot; was mixed and sometimes hostile (as was the case with Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s public response to Lowell&#x27;s Mandelstam translations). In a review of Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, the poet Michael Hofmann wrote that although he thought &quot;Life Studies&quot; was Lowell&#x27;s best book, &quot;Imitations&quot; was Lowell&#x27;s most &quot;pivotal book,&quot; arguing that the book &quot;marks the entry into his work of what one might term &#x27;international style&#x27;, something coolly open to not-quite-English.&quot; In the book&#x27;s introduction, Lowell explained that his idiosyncratic translations should be thought of as &quot;imitations&quot; rather than strict translations since he took many liberties with the originals, trying to &quot;do what [his] authors might have done if they were writing their poems now and in America.&quot;

Also in 1961, Lowell published his English translation of the French verse play &quot;Phèdre&quot; by 17th century playwright Jean Racine. Lowell changed the spelling of the title of the play to &quot;Phaedra&quot;. This translation was Lowell&#x27;s first attempt at translating a play, and the piece received a generally positive review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Broadway director and theater critic Harold Clurman wrote that Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Phaedra&quot; was &quot;a close paraphrase of Racine with a slightly Elizabethan tinge; it nevertheless renders a great deal of the excitement--if not the beauty--which exists in the original.&quot; Clurman accepted Lowell&#x27;s contention that he wrote his version in a meter reminiscent of Dryden and Pope, and while Clurman conceded that the feel of Lowell&#x27;s version was very different from the feel of French verse, Clurman considered it to be like &quot;a finely fiery English poem,&quot; particularly in passages where &quot;Lowell&#x27;s muse took flame from Racine&#x27;s shade.&quot;

Lowell&#x27;s next book of original verse &quot;For the Union Dead&quot; (1964) was widely praised, particularly for its title poem, which invoked Allen Tate&#x27;s &quot;Ode to the Confederate Dead.&quot; Helen Vendler states that the title poem in the collection &quot;honors not only the person of [the Civil War hero] Robert Gould Shaw, but also the stern and beautiful memorial bronze bas-relief [depicting Shaw and the all-black 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment] ... which stands opposite the Boston State House.&quot; Paula Hayes observes that, in this volume, &quot;Lowell turned his attention toward ecology, Civil Rights, and labor rights ... often to the effect of combining the three concerns.&quot; &quot;For the Union Dead&quot; was Lowell&#x27;s first book since &quot;Life Studies&quot; to contain all original verse (since it did not include any translations), and in writing the poems in this volume, Lowell built upon the looser, more personal style of writing that he had established in the final section of &quot;Life Studies&quot;. Lowell also wrote about a number of world historical figures in poems like &quot;Caligula,&quot; &quot;Jonathan Edwards in Western Massachusetts,&quot; and &quot;Lady Raleigh&#x27;s Lament,&quot; and he combined personal and public concerns in poems like the title poem and &quot;Fall 1961&quot; which addressed Lowell&#x27;s fear of nuclear war during the height of the Cold War.

In 1964, Lowell also wrote three one-act plays that were meant to be performed together as a trilogy, titled &quot;The Old Glory&quot;. The first two parts, &quot;Endecott the Red Cross&quot; and &quot;My Kinsman, Major Molineux&quot; were stage adaptations of short stories by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and the third part, &quot;Benito Cereno,&quot; was a stage adaptation of a novella by Herman Melville. &quot;The Old Glory&quot; was produced off-Broadway at the American Place Theatre in New York City in 1964 and directed by Jonathan Miller. It won five Obie Awards in 1965 including an award for &quot;Best American Play.&quot; The play was published in its first printing in 1965 (with a revised edition following in 1968).

In 1967, Lowell published his next book of poems, &quot;Near the Ocean&quot;. With this volume, Lowell returned to writing more formal, metered verse. The second half of the book also shows Lowell returning once again to writing loose translations (including verse approximations of Dante, Juvenal, and Horace). The best-known poem in this volume is &quot;Waking Early Sunday Morning,&quot; which was written in eight-line tetrameter stanzas (borrowed from Andrew Marvell&#x27;s poem &quot;Ode upon Cromwell&#x27;s Return from Ireland&quot;) and showed contemporary American politics overtly entering into Lowell&#x27;s work. Ian Hamilton noted that &quot;&#x27;Waking Early Sunday Morning&#x27; is now thought of as a key &#x27;political poem&#x27; of the 1960s.&quot;

During 1967 and 1968, Lowell experimented with a verse journal, first published as &quot;Notebook 1967-68&quot; (and later republished in a revised and expanded edition, titled &quot;Notebook&quot;). Lowell referred to these fourteen-line poems as sonnets although they sometimes failed to incorporate regular meter and rhyme (both of which are defining features of the sonnet form); however, some of Lowell&#x27;s sonnets (particularly the ones in &quot;Notebook 1967-1968&quot;) were written in blank verse with a definitive pentameter and a small handful also included rhyme. Regarding the issue of meter in these poems, Lowell wrote &quot;My meter, fourteen line unrhymed blank verse sections, is fairly strict at first and elsewhere, but often corrupts in single lines to the freedom of prose.&quot;

In the &quot;Notebook&quot; poems, Lowell included the poem &quot;In The Cage,&quot; a sonnet that he had originally published in &quot;Lord Weary&#x27;s Castle&quot;. He also included revised, sonnet versions of the poems &quot;Caligula&quot; and &quot;Night-Sweat&quot; (originally published in &quot;For the Union Dead&quot;) and of &quot;1958&quot; and &quot;To Theodore Roethke: 1908-1963&quot; (originally published in &quot;Near the Ocean&quot;). In his &quot;Afterthought&quot; at the end of &quot;Notebook 1967-1968&quot;, Lowell explained the premise and timeline of the book: This is not my diary, my confession, not a puritan&#x27;s too literal pornographic honesty, glad to share private embarrassment, and triumph. The time is a summer, an autumn, a winter, a spring, another summer; here the poem ends, except for turned-back bits of fall and winter 1968 ... My plot rolls with the seasons. The separate poems and sections are opportunist and inspired by impulse. Accident threw up subjects, and the plot swallowed them--famished for human chances. I lean heavily to the rational, but am devoted to surrealism. In this same &quot;Afterthought&quot; section, Lowell acknowledges some of his source materials for the poems, writing, &quot;I have taken from many books, used the throwaway conversational inspirations of my friends, and much more that I idly spoke to myself.&quot; Some of the sources and authors he cites include Jesse Glenn Gray&#x27;s &quot;The Warriors&quot;, Simone Weil&#x27;s &quot;Half a Century Gone&quot;, Herbert Marcuse, Aijaz Ahmad, R. P. Blackmur, Plutarch, Stonewall Jackson, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Steven Gould Axelrod wrote that, &quot;[Lowell&#x27;s concept behind the sonnet form] was to achieve the balance of freedom and order, discontinuity and continuity, that he [had] observed in [Wallace] Stevens&#x27;s late long poems and in John Berryman&#x27;s &quot;Dream Songs,&quot; then nearing completion. He hoped that his form ... would enable him &#x27;to describe the immediate instant,&#x27; an instant in which political and personal happenings interacted with a lifetime&#x27;s accumulation of memories, dreams, and knowledge.&quot; Lowell liked the new form so much that he reworked and revised many of the poems from &quot;Notebook&quot; and used them as the foundation for his next three volumes of verse, all of which employed the same loose, fourteen-line sonnet form.

In 1969, Lowell made his last foray into dramatic work with the publication of his prose translation of the ancient Greek play &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; by Aeschylus. The play was directed by Jonathan Miller, who had previously directed Lowell&#x27;s &quot;The Old Glory&quot;, at the Yale School of Drama.

===1970s===
In 1973, Lowell published three books of sonnets. The first two, &quot;History&quot; and &quot;For Lizzie and Harriet&quot;, consisted of revised and reordered versions of sonnets from &quot;Notebook&quot;. &quot;History&quot; included poems that primarily dealt with world history from antiquity up to the mid-20th century (although the book did not always follow a linear or logical path and contained many poems about Lowell&#x27;s friends, peers, and family). The second book, &quot;For Lizzie and Harriet&quot;, included poems that described the breakdown of his second marriage and contained poems that were supposed to be in the voices of his daughter, Harriet, and his second wife, Elizabeth. Finally, the last work in Lowell&#x27;s sonnet sequence, &quot;The Dolphin&quot; (1973), which won the 1974 Pulitzer Prize, included poems about his daughter, his ex-wife, and his new wife Caroline Blackwood whom he had affectionately nicknamed &quot;Dolphin.&quot; The book only contained new poems, making it the only book in Lowell&#x27;s 1973 sonnet trilogy not to include revised and reordered poems from &quot;Notebook&quot;.

A minor controversy erupted when Lowell admitted to having incorporated (and altered) private letters from his ex-wife, Elizabeth Hardwick into poems for &quot;The Dolphin&quot;. He was particularly criticized for this by his friends Adrienne Rich and Elizabeth Bishop. Bishop presented Lowell with an argument against publishing &quot;The Dolphin&quot;. In a letter to Lowell regarding &quot;The Dolphin&quot;, dated March 21, 1972, before he&#x27;d published the book, Bishop praised the writing, saying, &quot;Please believe that I think it is wonderful poetry.&quot; But then she stated, &quot;I&#x27;m sure my point is only too plain ... Lizzie [Hardwick] is not dead, etc.--but there is a &#x27;mixture of fact &amp; fiction&#x27; [in the book], and you have &quot;changed&quot; [Hardwick&#x27;s] letters. That is &#x27;infinite mischief,&#x27; I think ... One can use one&#x27;s life as material--one does anyway--but these letters--aren&#x27;t you violating a trust? IF you were given permission--IF you hadn&#x27;t changed them ... etc. But &quot;art just isn&#x27;t worth that much&quot;.&quot; Adrienne Rich responded to the controversy quite differently. Instead of sending Lowell a private letter on the matter, she publicly criticized Lowell and his books &quot;The Dolphin&quot; and &quot;To Lizzie and Harriet&quot; in a review that appeared in the &quot;American Poetry Review&quot; and that effectively ended the two poets&#x27; long-standing friendship. Rich called the poems &quot;cruel and shallow.&quot;

Lowell&#x27;s sonnets from the &quot;Notebook&quot; poems through to &quot;The Dolphin&quot; met with mixed responses upon publication, and critical consensus on the poems continues to be mixed. Some of Lowell&#x27;s contemporaries, like Derek Walcott and William Meredith, praised the poems. Meredith wrote about &quot;Notebook: 1967–68&quot;, &quot;Complex and imperfect, like most of the accomplishments of serious men and women today, Robert Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Notebook 1967–68&quot; is nevertheless a beautiful and major work.&quot; But a review of &quot;History&quot;, &quot;For Lizzie and Harriet&quot;, and &quot;The Dolphin&quot; by Calvin Bedient in &quot;The New York Times&quot; was mostly negative. Bedient wrote, &quot;Inchoate and desultory, the poems never accumulate and break in the great way, like a waterfall seen from the lip, more felt than seen. In truth, they are under no pressure to go anywhere, except to the 14th line. Prey to random associations, they are full of false starts, fractures, distractions.&quot; The sonnets also received a negative review by William Pritchard in the &quot;Hudson Review&quot;. Since the release of Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 2003, a number of critics and poets have praised the sonnets, including Michael Hofmann, William Logan, and Richard Tillinghast (though Logan and Hofmann note that they both strongly preferred the original &quot;Notebook&quot; versions of the sonnets over the revised versions that Lowell published in &quot;History&quot; and &quot;To Lizzie and Harriet&quot;). Still the sonnet volumes have received recent negative responses as well. In an otherwise glowing review of Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, A.O. Scott wrote, &quot;The three sonnet sequences Lowell published in 1973 ... occupy nearly 300 pages, and reading them, one damn sonnet after the other, induces more stupor than rapture.&quot; And in her review of the &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, Marjorie Perloff called the sonnet poems &quot;trivial and catty,&quot; considering them to be Lowell&#x27;s least important volumes.

Lowell published his last volume of poetry, &quot;Day by Day&quot;, in 1977, the year of his death. In May 1977, Lowell won the $10,000 National Medal for Literature awarded by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and &quot;Day by Day&quot; was awarded that year&#x27;s National Book Critics Circle Award for poetry. In a documentary on Lowell, Anthony Hecht said that &quot;[&quot;Day by Day&quot; was] a very touching, moving, gentle book, tinged with a sense of [Lowell&#x27;s] own pain and the pain [he&#x27;d] given to others.&quot; It was Lowell&#x27;s only volume to contain nothing but free verse. In many of the poems, Lowell reflects on his life, his past relationships, and his own mortality. The best-known poem from this collection is the last one, titled &quot;Epilogue,&quot; in which Lowell reflects upon the &quot;confessional&quot; school of poetry with which his work was associated. In this poem he wrote,

But sometimes everything I write
 with the threadbare art of my eye
 seems a snapshot,
 lurid, rapid, garish, grouped,
 heightened from life,
 yet paralyzed by fact.
 All&#x27;s misalliance.
 Yet why not say what happened? In her article &quot;Intimacy and Agency in Robert Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Day by Day&quot;,&quot; Reena Sastri notes that critical response to the book has been mixed, stating that during the initial publication of the book, some critics considered the book &quot;a failure&quot; while other critics, like Helen Vendler and Marjorie Perloff, considered it a success. She also notes that in reviews of Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 2003, &quot;Day by Day&quot; received mixed responses or was ignored by reviewers. Sastri herself argues that the book is under-appreciated and misunderstood. The book has received significant critical attention from Helen Vendler who has written about the book in essays and in her book &quot;Last Looks, Last Books: Stevens, Plath, Lowell, Bishop, Merrill&quot; (2010). In her essay &quot;Robert Lowell&#x27;s Last Days and Last Poems,&quot; she defended the book from attacks following its publication in reviews like the one written by the poet Donald Hall in which Hall called the book a failure, writing that he thought the book was &quot;as slack and meretricious as &quot;Notebook&quot; and &quot;History&quot; which preceded it.&quot; Vendler argued that most critics of the book were disappointed because Lowell&#x27;s last book was so much different from any of his previous volumes, abandoning ambitious metaphors and political engagement for more personal snapshots. She wrote, &quot;Now [Lowell] has ended [his career], in &quot;Day by Day&quot;, as a writer of disarming openness, exposing shame and uncertainty, offering almost no purchase to interpretation, and in his journal-keeping, abandoning conventional structure, whether rhetorical or logical. The poems drift from one focus to another; they avoid the histrionic; they sigh more often than they expostulate. They acknowledge exhaustion; they expect death.&quot; She praises some of Lowell&#x27;s descriptions, particularly of impotence, depression, and old age.

===Posthumous publications===
In 1987, Lowell&#x27;s longtime editor, Robert Giroux, edited Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Collected Prose&quot;. The collection included Lowell&#x27;s book reviews, essays, excerpts from an unfinished autobiography, and an excerpt from an unfinished book, tentatively titled &quot;A Moment in American Poetry&quot;.

Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, edited by Frank Bidart and David Gewanter, was published in 2003. The &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was a very comprehensive volume that included all of Lowell&#x27;s major works with the exception of &quot;Notebook 1967-1968&quot; and &quot;Notebook&quot;. However, many of the poems from these volumes were republished, in revised forms, in &quot;History&quot; and &quot;For Lizzie and Harriet&quot;. Soon after the publication of &quot;The Collected Poems&quot;, &quot;The Letters of Robert Lowell&quot;, edited by Saskia Hamilton, was published in 2005. Both Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; and his &quot;Letters&quot; received positive critical responses from the mainstream press.

Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;, including a previously unpublished youthful diary, were edited by Steven Axelrod and Grzegorz Kość in 2022.

==Tributes==
In 2001, the alternative rock band They Might Be Giants wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Robert Lowell&quot; which uses Lowell&#x27;s poem &quot;Memories of West Street and Lepke&quot; as the basis for the lyrics.

Lowell&#x27;s friendship with Elizabeth Bishop was the subject of the play &quot;Dear Elizabeth&quot; by Sarah Ruhl which was first performed at the Yale Repertory Theater in 2012. Ruhl used &quot;Words in Air: The Complete Correspondence Between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell&quot; as the basis for her play.

Lowell was a featured subject in the 2014 HBO documentary &quot;The 50 Year Argument&quot; about &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; which Lowell and his second wife, Elizabeth Hardwick, were both involved in founding. Although Lowell was not involved with editing the &quot;review,&quot; he was a frequent contributor. Lowell is featured in voice-over, photographs, video, and Derek Walcott reads from an essay on Lowell that Walcott published in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; after Lowell&#x27;s death.

<text>My Life as a Teenage Robot is an American animated science fiction superhero comedy television series created by Rob Renzetti for Nickelodeon. It was produced by Frederator Studios and Nickelodeon Animation Studio. Set in the fictional town of Tremorton, the series follows the adventures of a robot super-heroine named XJ-9, or Jenny Wakeman, as she prefers to be called, who attempts to juggle her duties of protecting Earth while trying to live a normal human life as a teenage girl.

Renzetti pitched the series to Frederator Studios&#x27; animated shorts showcase &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; and a pilot titled &quot;My Neighbor Was a Teenage Robot&quot;, which aired on December 4, 1999. Viewer approval ratings led to the commissioning of a half-hour series, which premiered on August 1, 2003; after airing its first two seasons, the series was on a 3-year hiatus starting on October 17, 2005. The completed third season eventually aired on Nickelodeon&#x27;s spinoff network Nicktoons from October 4, 2008, until ending its run on May 2, 2009. The series totals up to three seasons, consisting of 13 to 14 episodes each.

==Overview==
&quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot; is set in the fictional town of Tremorton, located near Omaha, Nebraska, and focuses on making lighthearted fun of typical teenage issues and conventions of works relating to teenagers and superheroes. The series follows XJ-9 (&quot;Jenny Wakeman&quot;, as she prefers to be called), who is a highly sophisticated state-of-the-art sentient robot girl created by her mother Dr. Nora Wakeman, an elderly robotics scientist, five years before the series. Jenny is Earth&#x27;s protector, armed with a wide range of weapons and devices, but simply wants to live the life of a normal teenager. She was preceded in development by eight other models; in season 1, the episode &quot;Sibling Tsunami&quot; introduced XJs 1–8.

Jenny&#x27;s friends are her neighbors Brad and Tuck Carbuckle. Brad is outgoing and adventurous, and is the first human friend Jenny makes, while Tuck is Brad&#x27;s rambunctious younger brother who usually tags along on adventures. Another one of her friends is Sheldon Lee, a somewhat stereotypical nerd who is obsessed with her; Jenny often rejects his romantic advances, but still cares for him as a friend. At Tremorton High School, however, Jenny has a tense, love-hate relationship with Britney &quot;Brit&quot; (voiced by Moira Quirk) and Tiffany &quot;Tiff&quot; Crust (voiced by Cree Summer), the school&#x27;s resident popular girls. 

Dr. Wakeman often tries in vain to control her creation and keep her daughter focused on protecting the planet Earth. Adding to her trouble is that she is constantly being dogged by the all-robotic Cluster Empire, whose queen, Vexus (voiced by Eartha Kitt) and sometimes Commander Smytus (voiced by Steve Blum) or Krackus (voiced by Jim Ward), wants her to join their world of robots (by force if necessary). Despite it all, Jenny struggles to maintain some semblance of a mostly human life.

The special of the series, &quot;Escape from Cluster Prime&quot;, shows that the alien planet is actually a peaceful paradise for every kind of robot. It&#x27;s also revealed that Vexus has made Jenny out to be a villain because of her constant refusals to join, branding her responsible for destroying the missing components that allow robots to transform, while they are truly hidden by Vexus, to control the population.

==Characters==
*Jennifer &quot;Jenny&quot; Wakeman (Robotic Global Response Unit Model No. XJ-9) (voiced by Janice Kawaye) is a sentient XJ-series humanoid robot created by Dr. Noreen Wakeman five years prior to the series, along with her half-done prototype predecessor sisters colored blue, green, and violet. Though she was designed to be Earth&#x27;s protector armed to the teeth with a wide range of weapons, devices and transformations, she desires to live the life of a normal teenager and often makes this covet quite apparent to her friends. Jenny&#x27;s personality is often kind, friendly, sweet, and optimistic, though this also comes with being rather naïve to her surroundings.
*Dr. Nora Wakeman (voiced by Candi Milo) is an elderly roboticist who built the XJ robots. She is often simply referred to as &quot;Mother&quot; or &quot;Mom&quot; by Jenny and her sisters.
*Bradley &quot;Brad&quot; Carbuckle (voiced by Chad Doreck) is Tuck&#x27;s older brother and Jenny&#x27;s best friend and next-door neighbor. He is outgoing and adventurous, and is the first friend Jenny ever made.
*Tucker &quot;Tuck&quot; Cornelius Carbuckle (voiced by Audrey Wasilewski) is Brad&#x27;s younger brother. He is usually tagging along with his brother and Jenny, though his aptitude for adventure is significantly less than Brad&#x27;s.
*Sheldon Oswald Lee (voiced by Quinton Flynn) is Jenny&#x27;s self-proclaimed romantic admirer. Jenny refuses his romantic advances, though she does care for him as a close friend. Being highly skilled in science and inventing, Sheldon has created gadgets and modifications for Jenny, usually very unnecessarily bulky and extravagant, as well as done minor repair work. He also occasionally masquerades as a robot superhero, the &quot;Silver Shell&quot;.

==Production==

Rob Renzetti moved from Cartoon Network to Nickelodeon to develop his own ideas as part of Fred Seibert&#x27;s and Frederator Studios&#x27; &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot;. At Nickelodeon, he developed a pilot called &quot;My Neighbor Was a Teenage Robot&quot;, which was the basis for the series. After brief stints working on &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;Time Squad&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?&quot;, and &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, Renzetti returned to Nickelodeon to start the &quot;Teenage Robot&quot; series.

Renzetti made 11 shorts during two seasons as a director on &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot;. Five of these starred two characters called Mina and the Count and followed the adventures of a rambunctious little girl and her vampire best friend. He hoped that these characters might get their own series, but Nickelodeon rejected the idea. Faced with an empty slot where the sixth Mina short was slated to go, Fred Seibert tasked Renzetti to come up with three new ideas. One of these was about a teenage girl whose boyfriend was a robot. After further thought, Renzetti merged the two characters to create Jenny, a robot with the personality of a teenage girl.

In March 2002, Nickelodeon ordered 13 episodes of the series. The series was initially called &quot;My Neighbor Was a Teenage Robot&quot; before settling on its final title.

==Cancellation==
The show&#x27;s crew revealed on their blog on October 17, 2005, that the show would be cancelled, and that the third season would be the last: &quot;The executives love the show but the ratings aren&#x27;t good enough for them to give us more episodes.&quot; The series wrapped production in April 2006. Following the series&#x27; cancellation, Renzetti returned to Cartoon Network Studios, working on &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; and &quot;The Cartoonstitute&quot;, before moving on to the Disney Channel to become supervising producer for &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;. The third season aired on Nicktoons from October 2008 to May 2009, officially concluding the broadcast of the series in the United States.

==Broadcast and home media==
Nickelodeon premiered &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot; on August 1, 2003, at 8:30 PM EST. The show was a part of Nickelodeon&#x27;s Friday night programming block called Friday Night Nicktoons in Fall 2003, and briefly was a part of the TEENick lineup in 2004 to June 2005. The first season ended on February 27, 2004, with &quot;The Wonderful World of Wizzly / Call Hating&quot;.

The second season premiered on December 8, 2004, with the Christmas episode &quot;A Robot For All Seasons&quot;. Another new episode was not aired until January 24, 2005. In the second season, a 48-minute, two-part TV movie titled &quot;Escape from Cluster Prime&quot; (which was nominated for an Emmy in 2006) aired.

Since the series&#x27; cancellation, reruns continued to air on Nicktoons until April 14, 2013. However, it started airing again on December 13, 2015, lasting until May 15, 2016. From March 2021 to January 2022, reruns of the series aired on TeenNick during its NickRewind block.

In 2021, the entire series was available for streaming on Paramount+. The series was removed from the streaming service on December 23, 2024.

The episodes &quot;See No Evil&quot;, &quot;The Great Unwashed&quot;, &quot;Future Shock&quot;, &quot;A Robot For All Seasons&quot;, &quot;Hostile Makeover&quot;, and &quot;Grid Iron Glory&quot; were released on Nick Picks DVD compilations. As of December 12, 2011, seasons 1, 2, and 3 are available on DVD exclusive to Amazon.com in region 1. The full series was released across six discs by Beyond Home Entertainment in Australia on February 5, 2012.
==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Sean Aitchison from CBR wrote positively of the show stating, &quot;Aside from the look of the show, &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot; had a fun premise that made for some great action comedy storytelling, and it definitely holds up [in modern day]. Though the show&#x27;s depiction of teendom is somewhat outdated, the cliches actually end up working in favor of the humor. Though there&#x27;s not a lot of story progression throughout the series, &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot; is still a whole lot of fun.&quot; Joly Herman of Common Sense Media wrote more negatively of the show, saying that, &quot;Though it looks cool and has an upbeat energy, the show can be a bit of a drag. Some kids may enjoy it for the mindless entertainment it intends to be, but know that there are much better uses of a free half-hour.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Other media==
Jenny was featured as a playable character in the PlayStation 2, Wii, and Nintendo DS versions of &quot;&quot; with Janice Kawaye reprising her role as the character. Jenny also appears as a playable character in the mobile game &quot;Nickelodeon Super Brawl Universe&quot;, the fighting game &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot; and its sequel, and the kart racing game &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway&quot; alongside Mrs. Wakeman, Brad, and Vexus as Chief power ups, with Kawaye reprising her role in the latter three games. Jenny also appears as a character skin for &quot;Smite&quot;, and was available during a July 2022 event.

As of 2023, creator Rob Renzetti has been publishing a web story based on the series in his personal newsletter. The story was written by Renzetti alongside Steven Michael Burns and Donovan Patton, with illustrations initially by &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot; art director Alex Kirwan, and later by storyboard artist Heather Martinez.

<text>Praga is a district of Warsaw, Poland. It is on the east bank of the river Vistula. First mentioned in 1432, until 1791 it formed a separate town with its own city charter.

== History ==

The historical Praga was a small settlement located at the eastern bank of the Vistula river, directly opposite the towns of Old Warsaw and Mariensztat, both being parts of Warsaw now. First mentioned in 1432, it derived its name from the Polish verb &quot;prażyć&quot;, meaning &quot;to burn&quot; or &quot;to roast&quot;, as it occupied a forested area that was burnt out to make place for the village. Separated from Warsaw by a wide river, it developed independently of the nearby city, and on 10 February 1648 king Władysław IV of Poland granted Praga with a city charter. However, as it was mostly a suburb and most buildings were wooden, the town was repeatedly destroyed by fires, floods and foreign armies. Currently the only surviving historical monument from that epoch is the Church of Our Lady of Loreto.

Although there were numerous attempts to build a permanent bridge across the river, none succeeded and Praga remained a separate entity well into the 18th century. Communication between the capital and Praga was maintained by privately run ferries and, in the winter, over the ice. Finally, in 1791, during the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski, Praga was attached to Warsaw as a borough.

The Battle of Praga, or the Battle of Warsaw, was a Russian assault during the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794. It was followed by a massacre in which 12,000 inhabitants of the Praga district lost their lives.
During the German occupation of Poland in World War II, in 1944, the Germans operated a subcamp of the Oflag 73 prisoner-of-war camp for officers in Praga. Unlike the central parts of Warsaw, Praga remained relatively untouched during the war and in the postwar period of reconstruction, the capital was home to many ministries and public facilities.

Because of the traditional separate status of Praga, there are two Catholic dioceses in Warsaw: &quot;Archdiocese of Warsaw&quot; with St. John&#x27;s Cathedral and &quot;Diocese of Warsaw-Praga&quot; with St. Florian&#x27;s Cathedral.

The derelict district experienced a revival following the end of Communism in 1989, as young artists moved into many of the former factory buildings, drawing crowds in search of something different from the Old Town. The increasing popularity of the area helped to change it into one of Poland&#x27;s and Europe&#x27;s creative hubs as it has been described as one of the &quot;trendiest neighbourhood across Europe&quot;.
In 2011 the local Monument to Brotherhood in Arms was taken down; in 2015 this decision was made permanent.

== Administrative division ==
Currently Praga is administratively divided into:

* Praga-Północ (Praga North)
* Praga-Południe (Praga South)

Praga-Południe and Praga-Północ include neighborhoods of:

* Saska Kępa
* Grochów
* Szmulowizna
* Gocław
* Kamionek

In the wider sense, all areas of Warsaw located on the right bank of Vistula are also known under the collective term of Praga. Besides historical Praga, they include:

* Białołęka
* Rembertów
* Targówek
* Wawer
* Wesoła

==Sights and landmarks==
* Praga Park
* Skaryszew Park
* Warsaw Zoo
* Museum of Praga
* Neon Museum in Warsaw
* Praga Koneser Center
* St. Florian&#x27;s Cathedral
* Baroque Church of Our Lady of Loreto
* Cathedral of St. Mary Magdalene
* Kazimierz Górski National Stadium

==Transport==
The Warszawa Wschodnia railway station, Warsaw&#x27;s second largest railway station and the sixth busiest station in Poland (as of 2021), is located in Praga.

<doc id="341738" wikidata="Q7826299" url="?curid=341738" title="Toronto Carrying-Place Trail">
<text>The Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, also known as the Humber Portage and the Toronto Passage, was a major portage route in Ontario, Canada, linking Lake Ontario with Lake Simcoe and the northern Great Lakes. The name comes from the Mohawk term &quot;toron-ten&quot;, meaning &quot;the place where the trees grow over the water&quot;, an important landmark on Lake Simcoe through which the trail passed.

==Route==

From Lake Ontario, the trail ran northward along the eastern bank of the Humber River. It forked at Woodbridge, with one path crossing the east branch of the Humber and running along the west side of the river to the vicinity of Kleinburg, where it crossed the river again. This trail was probably used during the seasons when the water was low enough to ford. The other path of the fork followed the east side of the river and angled cross-country to King Creek, joining the other fork before crossing the river near Nobleton, some north of Lake Ontario. From there it runs north over the Oak Ridges Moraine to the western branch of the Holland River, and from there north-east into Lake Simcoe some north.

A second route of the trail runs from Lake Ontario at the Rouge River, following the river northwest to the Oak Ridges Moraine. Crossing the Moraine it met the eastern branch of the Holland River near Aurora, Ontario. This arm appears to have been favoured by the French explorers in the area, without ever having seen the Humber arm. Near the mouth of the Rouge River, the Seneca had established a village by the name of Ganatsekwyagon. The Bead Hill site in Rouge Park is believed to contain the archaeological remains of the village. Traces of a village have been found on the Oakdale Golf &amp; Country Club grounds, adjacent to the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail. 

Once into Lake Simcoe, known as &quot;Ouentironk&quot; among the First Nations people living in the area, the trail continues north through straits on the north end of the lake into Lake Couchiching. These straits, an important fishing area, gave rise to the name Toronto, as this is &quot;the place where the trees grow over the water&quot;. The First Nations peoples had planted trees in the narrows between the lakes to act as a weir to catch fish. From there the trail follows the Severn River into Georgian Bay. Many of the major First Nations tribes lived in the area around and to the north of Lake Simcoe, which were easily reachable via the many rivers leading to the lake.

It is widely stated that the first European to see the Humber arm was Étienne Brûlé, who traveled it with a group of twelve Huron in 1615. However it is now believed that this is in error, and he actually traveled further west, to Lake Erie.

Further French settlement used the Humber portion of the trail primarily. Near the mouth of the Humber and along the Toronto Passage was a trading post called Teiaiagon, where the French and English met with the locals for trading. The site is marked with a plaque, and the ruins of a 19th-century mill stood nearby until the year 2000, when it was demolished and replaced by a new hotel, built in the style of the existing adjacent Tea Room. This included the construction of three forts on or near the trail. The first of these, known as Magasin Royal or Fort Douville, was built in 1720 about north of Lake Ontario on the Humber. The second, Fort Toronto, was built in 1750 only a few hundred metres north of the lake, right on the trail. The final one, Fort Rouillé (but also known widely as Fort Toronto), was built about to the east of the river during 1750 and 1751, and the site lies near the current bandstand at Exhibition Place.

The trail was widely used by both French and English fur traders until Toronto started to be permanently settled in the early 19th century, bringing to a close over a millennium of use. The connection north to Lake Simcoe was then made along Yonge Street, constructed after Simcoe followed the eastern branch into Toronto.

<doc id="341746" wikidata="Q3017571" url="?curid=341746" title="David Brower">
<text>David Ross Brower ( ; July 1, 1912 – November 5, 2000) was a prominent environmentalist and the founder of many environmental organizations, including the John Muir Institute for Environmental Studies (1997), Friends of the Earth (1969), Earth Island Institute (1982), North Cascades Conservation Council, and Fate of the Earth Conferences. From 1952 to 1969, he served as the first Executive Director of the Sierra Club, and served on its board three times: from 1941–1953; 1983–1988; and 1995–2000 as a petition candidate enlisted by reform-activists known as the John Muir Sierrans. As a younger man, he was a prominent mountaineer.

==Early life==
Brower was born in Berkeley, California. He was married to Anne Hus Brower (1913–2001) whom he met when they were both editors at the University of California Press in Berkeley. Anne was the daughter of Francis L M. Hus and Frances Hus (1876–1952), while Frances was the daughter of John P. Irish.

Kenneth Brower, David Brower&#x27;s son, has authored a number of books, most notably &quot;The Starship and the Canoe&quot; about Freeman Dyson and his son George Dyson.

==Mountaineering achievements==

Beginning his career as a world-class mountaineer with more than 70 first ascents to his credit, Brower came to the environmental movement through his interest in mountaineering. In 1933, Brower spent seven weeks in the High Sierra with George Rockwood. After a close call with a loose rock while climbing in the Palisades, he met Norman Clyde in the wilderness, who gave him some valuable climbing lessons. On that trip he also met Hervey Voge, who persuaded him to join the Sierra Club. On May 18, 1934, along with Voge, he began a ten-week climbing trip through the High Sierra, to survey climbing routes and maintain mountaineering records for the club. Previously, they had established several food caches along their planned route, which began at Onion Valley and ended at Tuolumne Meadows. In all, the pair climbed 63 peaks on this trip, including 32 first ascents. On the first day, they climbed Mount Tyndall, Mount Williamson, and Mount Barnard. From June 23 to 26, the pair made eight first ascents in the Devils Crags along with Norman Clyde, and also climbed Mount Agassiz. Clyde called the Devils Crag climbs &quot;one of the most remarkable mountaineering feats ever accomplished in the United States&quot;. In the Palisades range, the pair climbed Thunderbolt Peak, traversed to North Palisade by way of Starlight Peak, and descended the U-Notch Couloir. In the Sawtooth Range, they climbed The Doodad, the West Tooth, and Matterhorn Peak.
Following a failed attempt in 1935 to make the first ascent of the remote, icy Mount Waddington in British Columbia, with a Sierra Club group, Brower added winter climbing to his expertise and made multiple first winter ascents of peaks in the Sierra Nevada.

From October 9 to 12, 1939, a Sierra Club climbing team including Brower, along with Bestor Robinson, Raffi Bedayn, and John Dyer, completed the first ascent of Shiprock, the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano with nearly vertical walls on the Navajo reservation in northwestern New Mexico. This climb, rated YDS III, 5.7 A2, was the first in the United States to use expansion bolts for protection.

Twelve previous attempts on Shiprock had failed, and it was known as &quot;the last great American climbing problem&quot;. The Brower party&#x27;s success was described as an &quot;outstanding effort&quot; by &quot;probably the only group on the continent capable of making the climb&quot;.

Brower made the first ascent of seventy routes in Yosemite and elsewhere in the western United States.

==World War II==

In 1942, Brower edited and contributed to the &quot;Manual of Ski Mountaineering&quot;, published by the University of California Press and Cambridge University Press for use in training Allied mountain combat troops during World War II. Techniques described in this book were used by U.S. forces in the battles in the North Apeninnes and the Lake Garda Alps. The book was published in three later revised editions.
During World War II, he served as a lieutenant in the 10th Mountain Division, training its soldiers in mountaineering and cross-country skiing in Vermont and the state of Washington and earning a Bronze Star in action in Italy. Brower&#x27;s role in the 10th Mountain Division is featured in the documentary film &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot;. He served as a major in the Army Reserve for many years after the war ended.

==Career with Sierra Club==

After the war, Brower returned to his job at the University of California Press, and began editing the &quot;Sierra Club Bulletin&quot; in 1946. He managed the Sierra Club annual High Trips from 1947 to 1954. Brower was named the first executive director of the Sierra Club in 1952, and joined the fight against the Echo Park Dam in Utah&#x27;s Dinosaur National Monument. Taking advantage of his background in publishing, Brower rushed &quot;This is Dinosaur&quot; – edited by Wallace Stegner with photographs by Martin Litton and Philip Hyde – into press with publisher Alfred Knopf. Conservationists successfully lobbied Congress to delete Echo Park Dam from the Colorado River Storage Project in 1955, and the Sierra Club received much of the credit.

=== Coffee table books ===

Brower began Sierra Club Books&#x27; Exhibit Format book series with &quot;This is the American Earth&quot; in 1960, followed by the highly successful &quot;In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World&quot;, with color photographs by Eliot Porter in 1962. These coffee-table books sold well and introduced the Sierra Club to new members interested in wilderness preservation. Brower published two new titles a year in the series, but they began to lose money for the organization after 1964, though many claim they were the primary cause of the Club&#x27;s extraordinary growth and rise to national prominence. Financial management began to be a bone of contention between Brower and the Club&#x27;s board of directors.

===Membership rises, revenues drop===

Under Brower&#x27;s leadership from 1952 to 1969, the club&#x27;s membership expanded tenfold, from 7,000 to 70,000 members, becoming the nation’s leading environmental membership organization. Building on the biennial Wilderness Conferences which the Club launched in 1949 together with The Wilderness Society, Brower helped the Club win passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964. Brower and the Sierra Club also led a major battle to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the Grand Canyon. In 1964, Brower organized a dory river expedition led by Martin Litton with Philip Hyde and author Francois Leydet. The trip led to the book &quot;Time and The River Flowing&quot; which galvanized public opposition to the dams. In June 1966, the Club placed full-page ads in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; asking: &quot;Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?&quot; The campaign brought in many new members. The Internal Revenue Service announced it was suspending the Club&#x27;s non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable organization status. The board had set up the Sierra Club Foundation as an alternative for tax-deductible contributions, but revenues to the Club dropped, despite victories in blocking the Grand Canyon dams and a considerable increase in membership.

=== Board conflict and resignation ===

As annual deficits increased, tension grew between Brower and the Sierra Club board of directors. Another conflict grew over the Club&#x27;s position on the Diablo Canyon Power Plant planned for construction by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) near San Luis Obispo, California. The Club had played a major role in blocking PG&amp;E&#x27;s plan for a nuclear power plant at Bodega Bay in the early 1960s, but that campaign had centered on the earthquake danger from the nearby San Andreas Fault, not out of opposition to nuclear power itself. The Club&#x27;s board of directors had voted to support the Diablo Canyon site for the power plant in exchange for PG&amp;E&#x27;s moving its initial site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes. In 1967, a membership referendum upheld the board&#x27;s policy. Brower had come to believe that nuclear power was a dangerous mistake at any location, and he publicly voiced his opposition to Diablo Canyon, in defiance of the Club&#x27;s official policy.

Sierra Club board elections in the late 1960s produced sharply defined pro- and anti-Brower factions. In 1968, Brower&#x27;s supporters won a majority, but in 1969, anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Brower was charged with financial recklessness and insubordination by two of his former close friends, photographer Ansel Adams and board president Richard Leonard. Brower&#x27;s resignation was accepted by a board vote of ten to five.

=== Rejoins and resigns from board ===

Eventually reconciled with the Sierra Club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000. Brower was deeply concerned about issues of overpopulation and immigration – one of many issues that led to his resignation in protest from the board of directors in 2000. &quot;Overpopulation is perhaps the biggest problem facing us,&quot; he said, &quot;and immigration is part of that problem. It has to be addressed.&quot; His favorite example of how immigration should be addressed was the work of his cousin Boone Hallberg, a botanist who immigrated to Oaxaca to build a more sustainable agricultural economy in the area that so many of the workers on his family&#x27;s California farm had been forced to leave.

==Founds Friends of the Earth==

Brower founded Friends of the Earth (FOE) in 1969, soon after resigning as executive director of the Sierra Club. The move came during a burst of public environmental concern generated by the first Earth Day in April 1970. FOE also benefited from the publicity generated by a series of articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by John McPhee, later published as &quot;Encounters with the Archdruid&quot;, which recounted Brower&#x27;s confrontations with a geologist and mining engineer, a resort developer, and Floyd Dominy, the director of the Bureau of Reclamation. Brower so enjoyed being called the Archdruid that he later used the term in his e-mail address.

FOE set up its headquarters in San Francisco, and opened an office in Washington, D.C. Brower soon spun off two new organizations from the FOE Washington staff: the League of Conservation Voters in 1970, founded by Marion Edey, and the Environmental Policy Center in 1971. Brower&#x27;s international contacts led to the founding of FOE International in 1971, a loose federation of sister organizations in some forty-four countries. Brower also started a publications program at FOE, which had initial success with &quot;The Environmental Handbook&quot; in the wake of Earth Day, but then began to lose money.

=== Widens environmental campaigns ===

Although Brower&#x27;s background was in the wilderness preservation wing of the conservation movement, he quickly led FOE to take on many of the issues raised by the new environmentalists. FOE campaigned against the Alaska pipeline, the supersonic transport airplane (SST), nuclear power, and the use of the defoliant Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. After Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980, FOE led the opposition to Interior secretary James G. Watt&#x27;s efforts to sell and lease public lands in the West and develop land adjacent to the National Parks.

=== Resigns from board ===

Brower retired as executive director of FOE on its tenth anniversary in 1979, but continued as chairman of its board of directors. FOE&#x27;s growing debt and tension between Washington lobbying and grassroots action led to a crisis between Brower and a majority of the board that recalled his conflict with the Sierra Club board. Facing staff cuts in 1984, Brower appealed over the board directly to the membership for emergency contributions. He was removed from the board for insubordination, but was reinstated when he threatened a lawsuit. In 1985 the board voted to close the San Francisco office and move to Washington, D.C.. A referendum of the membership supported the board majority, and Brower resigned in 1986 to work through his Earth Island Institute.

==Later years with Earth Island Institute==
Brower incorporated Earth Island Institute in 1982. After FOE moved its headquarters to Washington, D.C., in 1986, Brower developed Earth Island as a loosely structured incubator for innovative projects in ecology and social justice. Although he chaired the board of directors, Brower stayed in the background as co-directors David Philips and John Knox ran the organization. Projects were required to bring in their own funding, and often went their own way once well-established. Groups formed under Earth Island&#x27;s umbrella include the Rainforest Action Network, the Environmental Project on Central America (EPOCA), and many others. Freed from administrative worries and budget controversies, Brower was able to continue to travel, speak and work on many of his long-standing concerns. In addition to his returning to the Sierra Club board for two separate terms, he also served on the Board of Directors for Native Forest Council from 1988 until his death in 2000. A supporter of Ralph Nader, Brower flew to Denver in June 2000 for the Green Party convention. The day before he died, Brower cast his absentee ballot for Nader. He died at his home in Berkeley, California, on November 5, 2000.

A monument, &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot;, was erected in his honor at Kennesaw State University. The monument is meant to serve as a reminder to future generations about the precious nature of the planet.

<text>&quot;Pop! Goes the Weasel&quot; (Roud 5249) is a traditional old English song, a country dance, nursery rhyme, and singing game that emerged in the mid-19th century. It is commonly used in jack-in-the-box toys and for ice cream trucks.

== Origin ==
In the early 1850s, Miller and Beacham of Baltimore published sheet music for &quot;Pop goes the Weasel for Fun and Frolic&quot;. This is the oldest known source that pairs the name to this tune. Miller and Beacham&#x27;s music was a variation of &quot;The Haymakers&quot;, a tune dating back to the 1700s. &quot;Gow&#x27;s Repository of the Dance Music of Scotland&quot; (1799 to 1820), included &quot;The Haymakers&quot; as a country dance or jig. One modern expert believes the tune, like most jigs, originated in the 1600s.

In June 1852, the boat &quot;Pop Goes The Weasel&quot; competed in the Durham Regatta. By December 1852, &quot;Pop Goes The Weasel&quot; was a popular social dance in England. A ball held in Ipswich on 13 December 1852 ended with &quot;a country dance, entitled &#x27;Pop Goes the Weasel&#x27;, one of the most mirth inspiring dances which can well be imagined.&quot;

On 24 December 1852, an ad in the &quot;Birmingham Journal&quot; offered lessons in the &quot;Pop Goes The Weasel&quot; dance, described as a &quot;highly fashionable Dance, recently introduced at her Majesty&#x27;s and the Nobility&#x27;s private soirees&quot;. On 28 December 1852, an advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; promoted a publication that included &quot;the new dance recently introduced with such distinguished success at the Court balls&quot; and contained &quot;the original music and a full explanation of the figures by Mons. E. Coulon&quot;. Eugene Coulton was a dance-master of international renown. In January 1853, the &quot;Bath Chronicle&quot; featured an advertisement from dance master, Mr. T. B. Moutrie, for &quot;instruction in the highly fashionable dances&quot; including &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;&quot;.&quot;

Sheet music dated 1853 at the British Library describes it as &quot;An Old English Dance, as performed at Her Majesty&#x27;s &amp; The Nobilities Balls, with the Original Music&quot;. Also In 1853, American sheet music referred to it as &quot;an old English Dance lately revived&quot;.

Originally, the dance was an instrumental jig except for the refrain &quot;pop goes the weasel&quot; which was sung or shouted as one pair of dancers moved under the arms of the other dancers. The British Library&#x27;s 1853 tune is very similar to that used today but the only lyrics are &quot;pop goes the weasel&quot;. The Library of Congress has similar sheet music with an arrangement by James W. Porter in 1853. Like its British counterpart, its only lyrics are &quot;pop goes the weasel&quot;. Porter&#x27;s version also describes the dance as taught at Mr. Sheldon&#x27;s Academy in Philadelphia:
FIGURES: Form in Two Lines – Top Couple Ballaneez, Four Bars – then Gallop down inside and back, Four Bars – take the next Lady, Hands Round Four Bars – then Two Bars back and (while all Sing Pop goes the Weasel) pass her under your arms to her Place – Repeat with the lady&#x27;s Partner then Gallop down the inside and back, Four Bars – and down outside to the other end of the line, Four Bars, which finishes the Figure – The next couple follows, &amp;c. &amp;c.
By 1854, Louis S. D. Rees &quot;changed completely&quot; the arrangement with &quot;easy &amp; brilliant variations&quot;. A modern music historian notes, &quot;This bravura version introduces the theme as a jig, as in the original, but the variations are in 2/4 and 4/4, much better for showing off fast fingerwork. No dancing to this one!&quot;

The popular dance was performed on stage and in stage and dance halls. By late 1854, lyrics were added to the well-known tune, with the first singing performance possibly at the Grecian Theatre. In 1855, The National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in England and Wales wrote that the song, commonly played by hand–organs on the streets, had &quot;senseless words&quot;. In their monthly newsletter, the society referred to the song as &quot;street music&quot; on the level of &quot;negro tunes&quot;, saying it was &quot;contagious and pestilent&quot;. In another newsletter, the society wrote, &quot;Worst of all.. almost every species of ribaldry and low wit has been rendered into rhyme to suit it.&quot;

In 1856, a letter to &quot;The Morning Post&quot; read, &quot;For many months, everybody has been bored to death with the eternal grinding of this ditty on street.&quot; Since at least the late 19th century, the nursery rhyme was used with a British children&#x27;s game similar to musical chairs. The players sing the first verse while dancing around rings. There is always one ring less than the number of players. When the &quot;pop goes the weasel&quot; line is reached, the players rush to secure a ring. The player that fails to secure a ring is eliminated as a &quot;weasel&quot;. There are succeeding rounds until the winner secures the last ring.

In America, the tune became a standard in minstrel shows, featuring additional verses that frequently covered politics. Charley Twigg published his minstrel show arrangement in 1855 with the refrain &quot;Pop goes de weasel.&quot;.

==Eugène Coulon==

On 24 December 1852, the newspaper, the Gloucester Journal reported &quot;A new dance has been introduced by a Frenchman—it is called &quot;Pop goes the Weasel&quot;, and from the title should be a comical affair&quot;. That Frenchman was probably either Eugène Coulon or Louis-Antoine Jullien, as four days later in The Times, London, music publishers Jullien &amp; Co. advertised &quot;Pop goes the Weasel: the new dance recently introduced ...is now published with the original music and a full explanation of the figures, by Mons. E. Coulon.&quot; In a later advertisement George Thompson is named as the arranger of the music.

Adding support to Coulon&#x27;s role is an advertisement from a dance teacher, Madame Catarina St. Louin, offering lessons in the &quot;latest and most fashionable dances, including &quot;Pop goes the Weasel&quot;,&quot;La Tempéte&quot;, and &quot;Coulon&#x27;s Quadrille&quot;, by permission of M. Eugène Coulon, as lately introduced by him at Her Majesty&#x27;s and the Nobility&#x27;s Balls&quot;.

The Jullien &amp; Co. publication with the original music arranged by George Thompson is the oldest known music for the dance. In it Coulon described Pop goes the Weasel &quot;as a very old and a very animated English dance that has lately been revived among the higher classes of society&quot;, and as his instructions were soon copied by other music publishers, with and without attribution, he appears to have been the authority for the dance.

== Lyrics ==
=== British version ===
The lyrics may have predated the dance as either a rhyme or the lyrics of another song dating to the 1600s. Regardless, there are many different versions of the lyrics. In England, most versions share the basic verse:

=== American variations ===
When the song crossed the Atlantic in the 1850s, the British lyrics were still changing. In the United States, the most common lyrics are different and may have a separate origin. The following lyrics were printed in Boston in 1858:

The March 1860 issue of the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; published a new verse:

In New York in 1901, the opening lines were, &quot;All around the chicken coop / The possum chased the weasel.&quot; By the mid-20th century, the standard United States version had replaced the &quot;cobbler&#x27;s bench&quot; with a &quot;mulberry bush&quot;:
Or the standard United States version had this line.

In 1994, the American Folklife Center documented a version of the song with sixteen verses.

==Meaning and interpretations==
=== Title ===
There has been much speculation about the meaning of the phrase and song title, &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;. Some say a weasel is a tailor&#x27;s flat iron, silver-plate dishes, a dead animal, a hatter&#x27;s tool, or a spinner&#x27;s weasel. One writer notes, &quot;Weasels do pop their heads up when disturbed and it is quite plausible that this was the source of the name of the dance.&quot;

Just like the dancers to this jig, the spinner&#x27;s weasel revolves, but to measure the thread or yarn produced on a spinning wheel. Forty revolutions of most weasels produce of yarn or a skein. The weasel&#x27;s wooden gears are designed to make a popping sound after the 40th revolution to tell the spinner that the skein is completed.

Iona and Peter Opie observed that no one seemed to know what the phrase meant at the height of the dance craze in the 1850s. It may just be a nonsensical phrase. However, one further explanation links the lyrics of the popular nursery rhyme to the East London colloquial dialect of the 1800’s, known as “Cockney Rhyming Slang”. In this dialect “weasel” relates to “weasel and stoat”, or coat, and “pop” relates the “pop shop” or pawnbrokers shop. The rhyme describes someone running short of money purchasing rice and treacle (metaphor for life’s essentials); “that’s the way the money goes”. Subsequently, this forces them to sell (pop) their coat (weasel) to the pawnbroker (pop shop).

=== First verse ===
The first verse refers to &quot;tuppenny rice&quot; and &quot;treacle&quot; which are food. At the time, one pound of rice pudding cost twopence (pronounced tuppence). Treacle is a delicious gooey syrup used as a topper to sweeten the rice pudding. A modern writer notes, it was &quot;the cheapest and nastiest food&quot; available to London&#x27;s poor.

Some lyrics in the British version may originate with Cockney slang and rhyming slang. In the mid-19th century, &quot;pop&quot; was a well-known slang term for pawning something—and City Road had a well-known pawn establishment in the 1850s. In this Cockney interpretation, &quot;weasel&quot; is Cockney rhyming slang for &quot;weasel and stoat&quot; meaning &quot;coat&quot;. Thus, to &quot;pop the weasel&quot; meant to pawn your coat. However, one author notes that the Cockney rhyming slang &quot;weasel and stoat&quot; was not used until the 1930s. Another early source says weasel was slang for silver-plate cups and dishes or anything of value that was pawnable.

In 1905, &quot;The London Globe&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a story saying that a &quot;weasel&quot; was a coin purse made of weasel skin that closed with a &quot;snap&quot;.

=== Second verse ===
The &quot;Eagle&quot; on City Road in the song&#x27;s second verse may refer to a famous pub in London. The Eagle Tavern was on City Road, rebuilt as a music hall in 1825, and rebuilt in 1901 as a public house called The Eagle. As one writer concludes, &quot;So the second verse says that visiting the Eagle causes one&#x27;s money to vanish, necessitating a trip up the City Road to Uncle [the pawn shop] to raise some cash.&quot;

Today, The Eagle has the lyrics to this verse painted on a plaque on its façade.

=== Third verse ===
In the third verse, the monkey may relate to a drinking vessel. In the 19th century, sailors referred to the glazed jugs used in public houses as &quot;monkey&quot;. A &quot;stick&quot; was a shot of alcohol such as rum or brandy. To &quot;knock it off&quot; meant to knock it back—or to drink it. The night out drinking used up all the money, conveyed in the lyrics &quot;that&#x27;s the way the money goes.&quot;

=== Fourth verse ===
The fourth verse relates to a tailor and clothing. Purchasing thread and needles may refer to paying for the items needed to work.

=== Fifth verse ===
The meaning of the fifth verse is more elusive. Here, &quot;monkey&quot; may refer to the slang use of the word for money worries, as in &quot;monkey on your back&quot;. To be chased by the monkey could mean having money troubles—one way out was to pawn your coat. It also might refer to the actual animal, commonly associated with the organ grinders who played this jig.

=== Other interpretations ===
With some versions and interpretations of the lyrics, &quot;pop goes the weasel&quot; is said to be erotic or ribald, including a crude metaphor for sexual intercourse. In her autobiographical novel &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; (1932), American author Laura Ingalls Wilder recalled her father singing these lyrics in 1873:

<text>The 5th Panzer Division () was an armoured division of the German Army during World War II, established in 1938.

The division fought in Poland, France, the Balkans and in the Soviet Union; first as part of Army Group Centre (1941–44) and then Army Group North. The division surrendered to Soviet and Western Allied forces in April and May 1945.

==History==
The 5th Panzer Division was formed in Oppeln, now Opole in Poland, on 15 November 1938 as part of a second wave of new armoured divisions in Germany following the creation of the original three tank divisions in 1935. Alongside the 5th Panzer Division the 4th had been formed in Würzburg five days earlier. The personnel of the division was mainly made up of Silesians and Sudeten Germans, the Sudetenland having been annexed by Germany shortly before.

The division took part in the invasion of Poland in 1939 but played no major role in it, being part of the southern thrust of the German advance towards Lwów and taking part in the Battle of Lwow. The 5th Panzer Division played a much greater role in the German invasion of France and Belgium. It took part in the battle of Belgium, advanced towards Lille and participated in the Battle of Dunkirk. It continued its advance south, took Brest on 19 June and continued on towards the French-Spanish border. The division remained in France until January 1941. During this time, in September 1940, it lost one of its two tank regiments to the newly created 11th Panzer Division in an effort to increase the number of German tank divisions that, in turn, slightly weakened the existing ones.

The 5th Panzer Division was sent to Romania and Bulgaria in early 1941 and took part in the German invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece. It advanced through southern Yugoslavia and into Greece and was engaged in heavy fighting against the 2nd New Zealand Division. After the end of the Greek campaign the division was sent to the north to participate in the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, in which the 5th Panzer Division took part in the advance on Moscow. Coming within 34 km of the city the division was forced to retreat after the Soviet counterattack in December 1941 and remained in a defensive position throughout the winter of 1941–42. It did not take part in the German advance on the Caucasus and the Volga, Case Blue, instead remaining with the Army Group Center and being engaged in defensive battles.

The division did not actively participate in the German offensive during the Battle of Kursk but was involved in defensive battles after the failure of the former. For the remainder of the war the division continued to retreat and fight in defensive battles on the Eastern Front in Poland, briefly in Courland and East Prussia. It was trapped on the Samland peninsula in April 1945 and parts of the division were evacuated by the German Navy, thereby being able to surrender to the Western Allies at the end of the war. The remainder surrendered to Soviet forces in April 1945.

Throughout the fighting on the Eastern Front the division was seen as one of the best German units by their Soviet counterparts. Up until July 1944, when Operation Bagration caused the destruction of the German Army Group Center, the Soviet High Command advised against directly engaging the division if possible.

<doc id="341772" wikidata="Q28405" url="?curid=341772" title="Gojoseon">
<text>Gojoseon (; ), contemporary name Joseon (; ), was the first kingdom on the Korean Peninsula. According to Korean mythology, the kingdom was established by the legendary king Dangun. Gojoseon possessed the most advanced culture in the Korean Peninsula at the time and was an important marker in the progression towards the more centralized states of later periods. The addition of &quot;Go&quot; (), meaning &quot;ancient&quot;, is used in historiography to distinguish the kingdom from the Joseon dynasty, founded in 1392 CE.

According to the &quot;Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Gojoseon was established in 2333 BCE by Dangun, who was said to be born from the heavenly prince Hwanung and a bear-woman, Ungnyeo. While Dangun is a mythological figure of whose existence no concrete evidence has been found, some interpret his legend as reflections of the sociocultural situations involving the kingdom&#x27;s early development. Regardless, the account of Dangun has played an important role in the development of Korean identity. Today, the founding date of Gojoseon is officially celebrated as National Foundation Day in North and South Korea.

Some sources claim that in the 12th century BCE, following the establishment of Gojoseon, Jizi (also known as Gija), a sage who belonged to the royal family from the Shang dynasty, immigrated to the northern part of the Korean Peninsula and became the founder of Gija Joseon. There are many interpretations of Gojoseon and Gija Joseon as well as debates regarding Gija Joseon&#x27;s existence.

In 194 BCE, the ruling dynasty of Gojoseon was overthrown by Wi Man (Wei Man in Chinese), a refugee from the Han vassal state of Yan, who then established Wiman Joseon.

In 108 BCE, the Han dynasty, under Emperor Wu, invaded and conquered Wiman Joseon. The Han established four commanderies to administer the former Gojoseon territory. After the fragmentation of the Han Empire during the 3rd century and the subsequent chaotic 4th century, the area escaped Chinese control and was conquered by Goguryeo in 313 CE.

The capital of Gojoseon was Wanggeom (modern Pyongyang) from at least the 2nd century BCE. In the southern region of the Korean Peninsula, the Jin state arose by the 3rd century BCE.

==Founding myths==
There are three different main founding myths concerning Gojoseon, which revolve around Dangun, Gija, or Wi Man.

===Dangun myth===
The myths revolving around Dangun were recorded in the later Korean work &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; of the 13th century. This work states that Dangun, the offspring of a heavenly prince and a bear-woman, founded Gojoseon in 2333 BCE, and was succeeded by Gija (Qizi) after King Wu of Zhou had placed him onto the throne in 1122 BCE. A similar account is found in &quot;Jewang Ungi&quot;. According to the legend, the Lord of Heaven, Hwanin had a son, Hwanung, who descended to Baekdu Mountain and founded the city of Shinsi. Then a bear and a tiger came to Hwanung and said that they wanted to become people. Hwanung said to them that if they went in a cave and lived there for 100 days while only eating mugwort and garlic he would change them into human beings. However, about halfway through the 100 days the tiger gave up and ran out of the cave. The bear, in contrast, successfully restrained herself and became a beautiful woman named Ungnyeo. Hwanung later married Ungnyeo, and she gave birth to Dangun.

While the Dangun story is considered to be a myth, it is believed it is a mythical synthesis of a series of historical events relating to the founding of Gojoseon. There are various theories on the origin of this myth. Seo and Kang (2002) believe the Dangun myth is based on integration of two different tribes, an invasive sky-worshipping Bronze Age tribe and a native bear-worshipping neolithic tribe, that led to the foundation of Gojoseon. Lee K. B. (1984) believes &#x27;Dangun-wanggeom&#x27; was a title borne by successive leaders of Gojoseon.

Dangun is said to have founded Gojoseon around 2333 BCE, based on the descriptions of the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, &quot;Jewang Ungi&quot;, &quot;Tongguk t&#x27;onggam&quot; and the &quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;. The date differs among historical sources, although all of them put it during the mythical Emperor Yao&#x27;s reign (traditional dates: 2357 BCE? – 2256 BCE?). &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; says Dangun ascended to the throne in the 50th year of the legendary Yao&#x27;s reign, &quot;Annals of the King Sejong&quot; says the first year, and &quot;Tongguk t&#x27;onggam&quot; says the 25th year.

In the 7th century BCE, the Yan pioneered the Northeast regions. According to &quot;The Growth of Yan&quot; and &quot;The Context of Guanzi&quot;, it can be presumed that Gojoseon grew through trade in this era. It is estimated that Gojoseon developed so far as to be able to wage war against the Yan in the 4th century BCE.

===Gija myth===
Gija, a man from the period of the Shang dynasty, allegedly fled to the Korean peninsula in 1122 BCE during the fall of the Shang to the Zhou dynasty and founded Gija Joseon. Gija Joseon is recognized and mentioned in the earliest surviving Chinese record, &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. Gija&#x27;s story was further developed in later Korean texts such as &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; and &quot;Jewang ungi&quot;. By the middle of Goryeo dynasty, a state cult had developed around Gija. The &quot;Dongsa Gangmok&quot; of 1778 described Gija&#x27;s activities and contributions in Gojoseon. The records of Gija refer to Eight Prohibitions (), that are recorded by the &quot;Book of Han&quot; and evidence a hierarchical society with legal protections of private property.

In pre-modern Korea, Gija represented the authenticating presence of Chinese civilization. Until the 12th century CE, Koreans commonly believed that Dangun bestowed upon Korea its people and basic culture, while Gija gave Korea its high culture, and presumably, standing as a legitimate civilisation.

Many modern experts have denied Gija Joseon&#x27;s existence for various reasons, mainly due to contradicting archaeological evidence and anachronistic historical evidence. They point to the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; and the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius, which were among the first works to mention Gija, but do not mention his migration to Gojoseon. Gija Joseon might have just existed as a symbol of the pre-Qin dynasty migrants who escaped the chaos of the Warring States period.

===Wi Man===
Wi Man was a military officer of the Yan of northeastern China who fled to the northern Korean peninsula in 195 BCE from the encroaching Han dynasty. He founded a principality with Wanggeom-seong as its capital, which is thought to be in the region of present-day Pyongyang. The 3rd-century Chinese text &quot;Weilüe&quot; of the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded that Wi Man usurped King Jun and thus took over the kingship of Gojoseon.

===Academic perspectives===

Gojoseon mythology and history can be divided into three phases, Dangun, Gija Joseon, and Wi Man Joseon.

# Kang &amp; Macmillan (1980), Sohn et al. (1970), Kim J.B. (1980), Han W.K. (1970), Yun N. H. (1985), Lee K.B. (1984), Lee J.B. (1987) viewed the Dangun myth as a native product of proto-Koreans, although it is not always associated with Gojoseon. Kim J.B. (1987) rejected the Dangun myth&#x27;s association with Gojoseon and pushes it further back to the Neolithic period. Sohn et al. (1970) suggested that the Dangun myth is associated with the Dongyi, whom they viewed as the ancestors of Koreans. Kim C. (1948) suggested the Dangun myth had a Chinese origin, tracing it to a Han dynasty tomb in the Shandong peninsula.
# Gardiner (1969), Henderson (1959), McCune (1962) considered the Gija myth to be a later conflation. Sohn et al. (1970) dismissed the Gija story as a Chinese fabrication. On the other hand, Hatada (1969), gave Gojoseon a Chinese identity, exclusively ascribed it to the Gija myth, and moved it to the 3rd century BCE. Shim Jae-Hoon (2002) accepted the eastward migration of Gija, but denied the relationship between Gija and Joseon, suggesting that the existence of Gojoseon could not be extended to the second millennium BCE.
# Kim C.W. (1966), Han W.K. (1970), Choi M.L. (1983, 1984, 1985, 1992), Han W.K. (1984), Kim J.B. (1987), Lee K.B. (1984) accepted Wi Man as a historical figure. Gardiner (1969) questioned authenticity of the Wi Man myth, although he mentioned there were interactions between Gojoseon and the Han dynasty and social unrest in the area during that time period.

====Controversies====
Around the mid-Joseon dynasty, the established view among historians traced Korean origins to Chinese refugees, considering Korean history that of a long series of kingdoms connected with China. As such, the Gija Joseon and Silla states were valorized, while the Gojoseon and Goguryeo states were not considered as important. According to this view, the first state in Korea, Gija Joseon, was founded by Jizi in 1122 BCE, who was a disgruntled Chinese advisor to the Shang dynasty. The story of how he brought poetry, music, medicine, trade, and a political system to the Korean peninsula was conceived similarly to the proposed Founding of Rome by the Trojan refugee Aeneas. But by the 1930s, under the influence of Shin Chaeho&#x27;s histories, the Jizi Korean founding story became less popular than that of Dangun, the son of a tiger and a bear – the latter being common in Japanese folklore – who brought civilization to the Korean peninsula. Shin and the other historians who promulgated this myth had been influenced by Daejonggyo, a new religious movement which worshipped Dangun, but attacked pre-annexation textbook narratives of Dangun which portrayed him as the brother of the Japanese god Susanoo. To Shin, Dangun was both the founder of the Korean &quot;minjok&quot; and the first Korean state (&quot;kuk&quot;), and thus the necessary starting point for Korean history. In response to a challenge by the Japanese scholars Shiratori Kurakichi and Imanishi Ryū of Dangun as a fabrication by the author of the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, nationalist historian Choe Nam-seon attacked Japanese mythology as being built upon fabrications.

By focusing on a mythological god which founded a &quot;sacred race&quot; (&quot;shinsŏng chongjok&quot;), Korean nationalist historiography aims to portray ancient Korea as a golden age of &quot;gods and heroes&quot; where Korea&#x27;s cultural achievements rivaled those of China and Japan. Accordingly, Shin Chaeho elevated Dangun to play a similar role as did the Yellow Emperor in China and which Amaterasu does in Japan. Choe Nam-seon, according to his , places Dangun even above the Chinese and Japanese emperors, because those rulers were supposedly Shamanistic rulers of the ancient Korean &quot;Părk&quot; tradition. The Dangun story also lends credence to claims that Korean heritage is over 5000 years old. According to Hyung Il Pai, the popularity of Dangun studies can be said to &quot;reflect the progressively ultra-nationalistic trend in Korean historical and archaeological scholarship today&quot;. Shin Chaeho named Mount Paektu in the Changbai Mountains on the Sino-Korean border as a part of Korean heritage, by virtue of connection with the mythical Dangun. The mountain, however, was also claimed by the Manchus of the Qing dynasty as part of their origin myth at least since the 17th century, and the mountain range is considered sacred in Han Chinese culture as well. This nationalist identification of Baekdu with Koreans was cemented by the operation of Korean independence movement partisans operating from the Chinese border and legitimized with associations to the history of the Gojoseon and Balhae states. The Chinese civilizational connection to ancient Korea continues to be attacked by North Korean historians, who allege that the history of Gija Joseon was &quot;viciously distorted by the feudal ruling class, the sadaejuui followers, and the big-power chauvinists&quot;.

==State formation==

The first mentions of Gojoseon are found in historical records of Guanzi. It locates Gojoseon around Bohai Bay and mentions the state trading with Qi (齊) of China. The &quot;Zhanguoce&quot;, &quot;Shanhaijing&quot;, and &quot;Shiji&quot;—containing some of its earliest records—refers to Joseon as a region, until the text &quot;Shiji&quot; began referring it as a country from 195 BCE onwards.

By the 4th century BCE, other states with defined political structures developed in the areas of the earlier Bronze Age &quot;walled-town states&quot;; Gojoseon was the most advanced of them in the peninsular region. The city-state expanded by incorporating other neighboring city-states by alliance or military conquest. Thus, a vast confederation of political entities between the Taedong and Liao rivers was formed. As Gojoseon evolved, so did the title and function of its leader, who came to be designated as &quot;king&quot; (Han), in the tradition of the Zhou dynasty, around the same time as the Yan (燕) leader. Records of that time mention the hostility between the feudal state in Northern China and the &quot;confederated&quot; kingdom of Gojoseon. Notably, a plan to attack the Yan beyond the Liao River frontier is recorded. This confrontation led to the decline and eventual downfall of Gojoseon, described in Yan records as &quot;arrogant&quot; and &quot;cruel&quot;. But the ancient kingdom also appears as a prosperous Bronze Age civilization with a complex social structure, including a class of horse-riding warriors who contributed to the development of Gojoseon and its northern expansion into most of the Liaodong basin.

Around 300 BCE, Gojoseon lost significant western territory after a war with the Yan state, but this indicates Gojoseon was already a large enough state that it could wage war against the Yan and survive the loss of 2000 li (800 kilometers) of territory. Gojoseon is thought to have relocated its capital to the Pyongyang region around this time.

===Wiman Joseon and Its Fall===

In 195 BCE, King Jun appointed a refugee from Yan, Wi Man, to guard the frontier. Wi Man later rebelled in 194 BCE and usurped the throne of Gojoseon. King Jun fled to Jin in the south of the Korean Peninsula.

In 109 BCE, Emperor Wu of Han invaded near the Liao River. A conflict would erupt in 109 BCE, when Wi Man&#x27;s grandson King Ugeo () refused to let Jin&#x27;s ambassadors through his territory in order to reach the Han dynasty. King Ugeo refused and had his son, Prince Wi Jang (長降) escort the ambassador back home. However, when they got close to Han&#x27;s borders, the ambassador assassinated Wi Jang (長降) and claimed to Emperor Wu that he had defeated Joseon in battle. Emperor Wu, unaware of this deception, made him the military commander of the Commandery of Liaodong. The outraged King Ugeo made a raid on Liaodong and killed She He. Scholars also hypothesize that the initiation of war may also have been because the Han dynasty was concerned that Gojoseon would ally with the Xiongnu against the Han.

In response, Emperor Wu commissioned a two-pronged attack, one by land and one by sea, against Gojoseon. The two forces attacking Gojoseon were unable to coordinate well with each other and suffered large losses. Eventually, the commands were merged, and Wanggeom fell in 108 BCE. Han took over the Gojoseon lands and established Four Commanderies of Han in the western part of former Gojoseon.

Gojoseon disintegrated by the 1st century BCE as it gradually lost the control of its former fiefs. Many successor states sprang from its former territory, such as Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye. Goguryeo and Baekje arose out from Buyeo.

==Culture==
Around 2000 BCE, a new pottery culture of painted and chiseled design was developed. These people practiced agriculture in a settled communal life, probably organized into familial clans. Rectangular huts and increasingly larger dolmen burial sites were found throughout the peninsula. Bronze daggers and mirrors have been excavated, and there is archaeological evidence of small walled-town states in this period. Dolmens and bronze daggers found in the area are uniquely Korean and cannot be found in China. A few dolmens are found in China, mostly in the Shandong province.

===Mumun Pottery===
In the Mumun pottery period (1500 – 300 BCE), plain coarse pottery replaced earlier comb-pattern wares, possibly as a result of the influence of new populations migrating to Korea from Manchuria and Siberia. This type of pottery typically has thicker walls and displays a wider variety of shapes, indicating improvements in kiln technology. This period is sometimes called the &quot;Korean Bronze Age&quot;, but bronze artifacts are relatively rare and regionalized until the 7th century BCE.

Rice cultivation was extensive in the lower parts of South Korea and Manchuria in the periods between 1900 BCE to 200 CE.

===Bronze Tools===
The beginning of the Bronze Age on the peninsula is usually said to be 1000 BCE, but estimates range from the 13th to 8th centuries BCE. Although the Korean Bronze Age culture derives from the Liaoning and Manchuria, it exhibits unique typology and styles, especially in ritual objects.

By the 7th century BCE, a Bronze Age material culture with influences from Manchuria, eastern Mongolia, as well as Siberia and Scythian bronze styles, flourished on the peninsula. Korean bronzes contain a higher percentage of zinc than those of the neighboring bronze cultures. Bronze artifacts, found most frequently in burial sites, consist mainly of swords, spears, daggers, small bells, and mirrors decorated with geometric patterns.

Gojoseon&#x27;s development seems linked to the adoption of bronze technology. Its singularity finds its most notable expression in the idiosyncratic type of bronze swords, or &quot;mandolin-shaped daggers&quot; (). The mandolin-shape dagger is found in the regions of Liaoning, Hebei, and Manchuria down to the Korean Peninsula. It suggests the existence of Gojoseon dominions. Remarkably, the shape of the &quot;mandolin&quot; dagger of Gojoseon differs significantly from the sword artifacts found in China.

===Tombs===
====Dolmen Tombs====
Megalithic dolmens appear in Korean peninsula and Manchuria around 2000 BCE to 400 BCE. Around 900 BCE, burial practices become more elaborate, a reflection of increasing social stratification. Goindol, the dolmen tombs in Korea and Manchuria, comprising upright stones supporting a horizontal slab, are more numerous in Korea than in other parts of East Asia. Other new forms of burial are stone cists (underground burial chambers lined with stone) and earthenware jar coffins. The bronze objects, pottery, and jade ornaments recovered from dolmens and stone cists indicate that such tombs were reserved for the elite class.

Around the 6th century BCE, burnished red wares, made of a fine iron-rich clay and characterized by a smooth, lustrous surface, appear in dolmen tombs, as well as in domestic bowls and cups.

====Other types of tombs====
In 1964, through a joint excavation by China and North Korea, Gangsang tomb () and Nusang tomb () were found in 1964 at the Liaodong peninsula. Nusang was found earlier prior to the excavation in 1958 Gangsang and Nusang tombs are considered to be burial cairn tombs of local nobilities of Gojoseon. Some consider the tombs as the evidences of the slavery that could have existed, but others find that the evidences are inadequate and lacking to deduce such conclusion.

===Iron Culture===

Around this time, the state of Jin occupied the southern part of the Korean peninsula. Very little is known about this state except that it was the apparent predecessor to the Samhan confederacies.

Around 300 BCE, iron technology was introduced into Korea from Yan state. Iron was produced locally in the southern part of the peninsula by the 2nd century BCE. According to Chinese accounts, iron from the lower Nakdong River in the southeast was valued throughout the peninsula and Japan.

===Poetry===
In the book of Gogeumju (古今注) written by Cui Bao (崔豹) of the Western Jin period, poetry called Gonghuyin (箜篌引) or () is said to be of Gojoseon origin.
The poetry is as follows:

公無渡河 &quot;Don&#x27;t cross the river, my love.&quot;

公竟渡河 &quot;My love eventually crossed the river.&#x27;

墮河而死 &quot;Now that my love is drowned,&quot;

當奈公何 &quot;There&#x27;s nothing that I can do.&quot;

==Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea==
Numerous small states and confederations arose from the remnants of Gojoseon, including Goguryeo, the Buyeo kingdom, Okjeo, and Dongye. Three of the Chinese commanderies fell to local resistance within a few decades, but the last, Nakrang, remained an important commercial and cultural outpost until it was destroyed by the expanding Goguryeo in 313 CE.

Jun of Gojoseon is said to have fled to the state of Jin in the southern Korean Peninsula. Jin developed into the Samhan confederacies, the beginnings of Baekje and Silla, continuing to absorb migration from the north. The Samhan confederacies were Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan. King Jun ruled Mahan, which was eventually annexed by Baekje. Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla gradually grew into the Three Kingdoms of Korea that dominated the entire peninsula by around the 4th century.

<text>Wiman Joseon (194–108 BC) was a dynasty of Gojoseon. It began with Wiman&#x27;s (Wei Man) seizure of the throne from Gija Joseon&#x27;s King Jun and ended with the death of King Ugeo who was a grandson of Wiman. Apart from archaeological data, the main source on this historical period comes from chapter 115 of Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. Wiman was originally a Chinese military leader from the Kingdom of Yan under the Han dynasty.

== Founding ==

According to Sima Qian, Wiman was a general from the Kingdom of Yan of northeastern China after the collapse of China&#x27;s Qin dynasty, who submitted to Gojoseon&#x27;s King Jun. Jun accepted and appointed Wiman commander of the western border region of Gojoseon, which probably corresponds to the west of the present-day Liaoning. Despite the generosity that King Jun had demonstrated, Wiman revolted and destroyed Gojoseon. In 194 BC, he established Wiman Joseon and decided to locate his capital in Wanggeom-seong (왕검성, 王險城). Many Korean historians believe that the exact location of Wanggeom-seong was Yodong (요동) in Liaodong, China.

In this period, Wiman Joseon expanded to control a vast territory and became strong economically by controlling trade between the Han dynasty and the peoples of Manchuria. The Emperor Wu of Han thought that Wiman Joseon increasingly threatened the Han dynasty, and Wiman Joseon would ally with the Xiongnu.

==Canghai commandery==
Around the period from 128 BC to 126 BC, Canghai commandery, covering an area in northern Korean peninsula to southern Manchuria, existed. Nan Lü (Hanja: 南閭), who was a monarch of Dongye and a subject of Wiman Joseon, revolted against Ugeo of Gojoseon and then surrendered to the Han dynasty with 280,000 people. The Canghai Commandery was established following this revolution, however in 2 years, it was abolished by Gongsun Hong.

== Fall ==
Wiman&#x27;s grandson, King Ugeo (우거, 右渠), allowed many exiles from Han dynasty of China to live in Wiman Joseon. However, the number of Han grew, and King Ugeo prevented the Jin state from communicating with the Han dynasty. As a result, in 109 BC, the Emperor Wu of Han invaded Wiman Joseon near the Luan River. After failing several times to defeat Wiman Joseon&#x27;s armies, Han Wudi tried to convince the princes of Wiman Joseon to kill King Ugeo. The conspiracy failed and it led to the destruction of the Gojoseon kingdom. After the war, Wudi of Han dynasty sentenced two generals to death for failing to defeat Wiman Joseon.

After a year of battle, Wanggeom-seong was captured and Wiman Joseon was destroyed. The Han dynasty established the Four Commanderies of Han in the captured areas, which corresponds to the current area of Liaodong peninsula and the northwestern Korean peninsula. The Commanderies eventually fell to the rising Goguryeo in 4th century AD.

<text>The 130th Engineer Brigade is an engineer brigade of the United States Army headquartered in Schofield Barracks, Hawaii that provides engineering support to the United States Army Pacific. The brigade specializes in combat engineering, construction, and bridging operations.

The brigade traces its lineage back to an engineering regiment active during World War II, but the brigade itself did not see real-world action until the mid-1990s. As a part of the V Corps for most of the Cold War, the brigade was stationed in western Europe as a deterrent to a possible Soviet aggression and/or invasion. It finally saw action in 1991 when the Brigades 317th Engineer Battalion was deployed for Operation Desert Shield/Storm. The 317th provided support for the 1st Infantry Division during the ground war and its Delta Company received a Presidential unit citation. The brigade was also deployed in Operation Joint Endeavor, providing bridging assistance for the international force in the Bosnia region. Several years later, the brigade was the primary engineering component during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. With numerous difficulties, the brigade was forced to take on several unexpected missions during its year in Iraq. It saw a second tour in 2005 and a third in 2009 in which it once again was the primary engineering component in the country. The brigade deployed to Afghanistan as the Theater Engineer Brigade in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from 2013 to 2014.

The brigade had a long history of supporting V Corps of United States Army Europe from 1969 until 2007, during which it was based at Warner Barracks in the Bavarian town of Bamberg, Germany. That ended when the brigade was relocated to Hawaii to support United States Army Pacific as part of a major restructuring plan of the United States Army. Reactivated in 2008, the brigade is currently based out of Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.

== Organization ==
The 130th Engineer Brigade is a subordinate unit of the 8th Theater Sustainment Command which is operationally controlled by United States Army Pacific. It provides engineering assistance to United States forces stationed throughout the Indo-Pacific region.

The Brigade&#x27;s Headquarters and Headquarters Company is stationed at Schofield Barracks and permanently commands two subordinate battalions. The 11th Engineer Battalion located at Camp Humphreys, Korea, and the 84th Engineer Battalion located at Schofield Barracks. The total force of the brigade is approximately 1,600 personnel. As the brigade is modular in nature, it is able to take command and control of more units when deployed.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The 130th Engineer Brigade traces its lineage to the 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment which saw action in World War II. The regiment was activated on 15 July 1943 at Camp Ellis, Illinois. It was deployed to the European Theatre where it participated in the Battle of Normandy and subsequent invasion of Germany before being transferred to the Pacific after V-E Day. The 1303rd received campaign streamers for Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, Central Europe, and the Asian-Pacific theatre. It was deactivated in Japan on 31 January 1946.

The regiment was re-designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 130th Engineer Aviation Brigade in Japan on 8 July 1955 before being activated in September of that year. Only a few months later, this brigade was inactivated on 25 June 1956 without having seen any deployment.

On 16 June 1969, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 130th Engineer Aviation Brigade was re-designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 130th Engineer Brigade and activated in Pioneer Kaserne, Hanau, Germany. The 130th Engineer Brigade was a consolidation of V Corps&#x27; 37th and 11th Engineer Groups into a single unit that would provide more efficient command and control. It was subsequently put under the command of V Corps, as part of United States Army Europe. The brigade received its shoulder sleeve insignia on 23 September 1969, and its distinctive unit insignia on 3 November 1969. Brigade members specially designed these with images alluding to the 1303rd Regiment&#x27;s battle honors in World War II using scarlet and white, colors signifying US Army engineer units.

The brigade remained in Germany in support of V Corps for almost 25 years, on the Cold War frontline against the Warsaw Pact and Soviet 8th Guards Army. It underwent a shuffling of units as several of its battalions were reassigned elsewhere following the end of the Cold War in 1990, and it gained new battalions from units deactivating elsewhere. Though three of the brigade&#x27;s subordinate battalions deployed to support Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the brigade headquarters itself remained in Germany along with the rest of V Corps. The operations were conducted by VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps, which had significant engineer assets of their own. Throughout the early 1990s, the brigade would continue to see units come and go from its command as they were transferred from the restructuring 18th Engineer Brigade and the deactivating 7th Engineer Brigade (United States).

=== Operation Joint Endeavour ===

From December 1995 to January 1996, all units in the brigade, except the 320th Engineer Company (Topographic), deployed to Croatia or Bosnia and Herzegovina in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. The 320th Engineer Company deployed their topographic surveying platoon the following year. The 130th Engineer Brigade was tasked with building an assault bridge over the Sava River. Despite severe flooding conditions around the river and international pressure against such a structure, the brigade sent its units to begin work on the bridge. In December 1995, the 502nd Engineer Company deployed to Zupanja, Croatia and placed the historic ribbon bridge over the river. This bridge, at was the longest assault floating bridge in military history. The company operated 24-hours a day for three months crossing critical traffic in support of Task Force Eagle and NATO&#x27;s Implementation Force. The company also assisted in the construction of a second bridge over the Sava River in Brčko-Gunja. The 502nd Engineer Company redeployed in May 1996, with a rafting section remaining at Slavonski Brod to support the force restructuring of Task Force Eagle. The 130th Engineer Brigade would go on to construct seven fixed bridges in support of the operation. During the deployment, the brigade was also tasked with creating and maintaining maps and overlays of the area of operations. It would produce over 300,000 such maps. The 130th Engineer Brigade was also tasked with repairing and maintaining much of the Task Force&#x27;s infrastructure.

The brigade returned to Germany after the operation was complete. Throughout 1998–2002 it would train with German engineers, including German units from Lahnstein and Speyer, as well as the German Engineering School. The brigade also set up marksman competitions with German units, to give US soldiers the chance to earn the German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship, the German Sports Badge, and other badges. Over 2,500 of these badges would be earned by soldiers of the 130th over the years that it served in Germany. It also trained extensively in bridging operations at rivers throughout Germany. In summer of 2000, the brigade participated in a joint engineering exercise in Moldova with US Navy Seabees and the 505th Engineer Brigade of the North Carolina Army National Guard. The exercise was the first ever conducted in Moldova and featured numerous training scenarios as well as the construction of a medical clinic. Several other such exercises were conducted in nations throughout Europe including Albania, Romania, Georgia, Latvia, Bulgaria and Macedonia. They also performed annual humanitarian missions to Poland, working on community projects around the country with the assistance of Polish Armed Forces every September, as a training exercise.

=== Operation Iraqi Freedom ===
The 130th Engineer Brigade mobilized for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It was commanded by Colonel Gregg F. Martin. As preparations were being made for Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 130th Engineer Brigade was placed in charge of the largest engineering force in the theater. This included seven different engineering battalions as well as several separate group and company-sized elements. Units of the brigade were then deployed to Kuwait in early 2003, along with much of V Corps&#x27; staff. They would provide command and assistance for the 3rd Infantry Division, 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division as they crossed the border to Iraq and attacked to the capitol region of Baghdad from the south. Coupled with the landings of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team to the north, the operation would see the US Forces surround and destroy Iraqi forces in and around the capitol.

The first obstacle facing the brigade was &quot;the berm&quot;, a 10-kilometer-deep defensive obstacle complex that spanned Iraq&#x27;s border with Kuwait. The berm consisted of large tank ditches, berms of dirt, electrified fencing, and razor wire. It was decided that the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s Brigade Combat Teams would breach this berm in eight locations and move through. The 130th Engineer brigade analyzed the berms and provided a layout of them to coalition forces. The 130th Engineer Brigade then conducted the actual breaches in late March, using CEV, armored combat earthmovers to build roads for tracked vehicles, while armored vehicle-launched bridges set up for wheeled vehicles. The 130th worked with Kuwaiti engineers to breach the berm in 12 places, and the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s Brigade Combat Teams moved through, starting the Iraq War. After combat forces moved through, the brigade and the Kuwaitis then sealed off ten of these breaches to prevent Iraqi forces from using then, leaving two open for US forces that followed from the 82nd and 101st.

After the breach, the 130th moved into Iraq. They provided support for the divisions as they advanced along the path to Baghdad. When a large sandstorm grounded aviation and large dust clouds became a problem, the brigade repurposed oil for use in dust abatement around airfields, allowing the 101st&#x27;s fleet of AH-64 Apaches to take off and engage Iraqi ground forces on 24 March. Retreating Iraqi units detonated many bridges to slow the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s advance. The 130th Engineers conducted rapid repairs to allow the brigades to continue to move through. The brigade supported combat elements moving through An Najaf, clearing roads and pathways of debris and obstacles to allow rapid movement through the city. The 565th Engineer Battalion built the &quot;birthday bridge&quot; – the longest float bridge constructed in a combat theatre with a span of 580 meters – over the Tigris River in Tikrit on Saddam Hussein&#x27;s birthday, 28 April 2003.

After the invasion was over, the brigade was supposed to support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support. During the planning for the invasion, the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in Iraq would be conducted by Department of Defense contractors and Iraqi civilians. They were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts. When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs they had not been originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects on basic utilities, including schools, water treatment plants, waste removal, and the nation&#x27;s power grid. It was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater than what the US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies. It was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people. By May 2003, the brigade had been completely repurposed. Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles, building fortifications, and bridging operations, the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects. This conversion was a difficult process, as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale. As more US military reconstruction units arrived in Iraq, the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups.

The 130th Engineer Brigade focused on bridging projects as was its specialty, but it ultimately found itself undertaking numerous different projects throughout the country for much of 2003 and into 2004. Not all of its units were confined entirely to construction, though. The 502nd Engineer Company also conducted river patrol operations in Baghdad and Tikrit. This new mission for the company was essential for force protection, troop transportation, search and cordon operations, and to protect against sabotage on fixed bridges. In September 2003, with the inactivation of the 38th Engineer Company (Medium Girder Bridge), the 502nd Engineer Company became a multi-role bridge company with both float and fixed bridging capabilities and the only active bridge company in USAREUR.

The 130th was headquartered at Logistical Support Area Anaconda for the majority of the deployment. Throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom, the headquarters commanded up to 15,000 engineers at one time, conducting missions including bridging, humanitarian assistance, topographic missions, dive missions, firefighting, base construction, river patrols, mine detection, missile removal and many more. Brigade units redeployed to Hanau in late 2003 and early 2004. Most of the brigade&#x27;s soldiers returned to Hanau on 5 February 2004 after numerous logistical delays. Most of the 130th Engineer Brigade&#x27;s subordinate units would receive Meritorious Unit Commendation for their roles in the invasion of Iraq, though the Brigade&#x27;s headquarters did not.

=== Second tour in Iraq ===
The 502nd Engineer Company became the first V Corps company-sized unit to return for a second tour in Iraq when it deployed in September 2004. The company returned to Hanau in September 2005. In December 2004, the 130th Engineer Brigade&#x27;s headquarters was informed that it would be deployed back to Iraq the next year. The brigade mobilized and began this new deployment in September 2005; it began operating in the country the next month. The 54th Engineer Battalion followed in October. The brigade eventually replaced the 130th, 194th, and 20th Engineer Brigades, becoming the only engineer brigade operating in the country. By December 2006, the brigade commanded all engineering formations in Multi-National Corps - Iraq, including engineers from other branches of the US Military, for a total of 3,300 soldiers. During the tour they were supported by the 412th Engineer Command.

The 130th Engineers had a variety of reconstruction tasks during their second tour in Iraq. The top priority of the brigade was to &quot;maintain and upgrade lines of communications&quot; to &quot;insure uninterrupted ground movement through the area of operations.&quot; This duty also included detection and removal of Improvised Explosive Devices. The brigade undertook numerous construction projects, primarily in building coalition forward operating bases, but they were tasked with construction projects for the Iraqi army and civilians as well. Many of the units of the brigade were integrated with military from other branches for projects. US Navy and US Marine Corps engineers operated side by side with 130th Engineer Brigade soldiers, and though commanders reported a &quot;culture clash&quot; between different branches of service, the soldiers, sailors, and Marines were able to adapt to the situation quickly.

The brigade&#x27;s Headquarters Company managed the engineer battalions but it also undertook its own missions, including humanitarian missions and public affairs assignments. It was supported by the brigade&#x27;s Special Troops Battalion which provided a wide range of duties for the Headquarters. The task of detecting and removing IEDs proved particularly difficult for the brigade, as IEDs were a serious issue for coalition forces and the leading cause of casualties at the time. The 54th Engineer Battalion under the 130th was specially tasked with counter-IED operations on the over 300 kilometers of roads that the brigade was responsible for. The 249th Engineer Battalion was charged with maintaining the power grid throughout Iraq. They were required to assess 200 power stations throughout the country and make repairs to each one individually. The 84th Engineer Battalion was tasked with most construction projects in the Forward Operating Bases. These projects involved expansion of many of the larger FOBs as smaller ones were shut down and consolidated. One of the main focuses of the Battalion was the expansion of living quarters at Al Asad Air Base. The 565th Engineer Battalion was responsible for maintaining the supply yards housing building materials for the rest of the Brigade&#x27;s battalions, and to ensure that the materials were dispersed and used as efficiently as possible. The brigade&#x27;s mechanical and vehicle maintenance duties were provided by civilian contractors. These contractors also handled transportation of construction vehicles and vehicle parts to the theater.

During the year of its deployment in Iraq, the brigade reported progress in numerous areas. Brigade commander Colonel Thomas Kula reported that &quot;greater than 50 percent&quot; of IEDs found on roads used by the Corps were recognized and disarmed before they could be used against coalition forces. The brigade also cleared 700 kilometers of road from trash and debris and filled more than 600 potholes caused by explosions. It also completed 1,800 mapping projects in the theater. The brigade also finished numerous building projects around Iraq. Soldiers of the 130th Engineer Brigade completed 345 construction projects during the year in the country, including emplacing four bridges and maintaining eight more, well digging projects throughout western Iraq, maintaining the power grid to 25 coalition bases, repairing and expanding services at FOBs throughout the region, and construction of outposts and checkpoints throughout the country&#x27;s roadways with the assistance of Iraqi engineers. During the deployment, a total of 15 soldiers from the brigade were killed in action. The 130th Engineer Brigade returned to Hanau from its second tour in Iraq in October 2006.

=== Reactivation in Hawaii ===
With Army forces in Europe experiencing draw-downs and re-deployments, it was announced that V Corps would be eliminated, and the 130th Engineer Brigade would be moved elsewhere. The brigade formally left Hanau with a Casing of the Colors ceremony at Pioneer Kaserne on 4 May 2007. Casing the unit&#x27;s colors was a tradition formally signifying its inactivation and, for all official purposes, the brigade had ceased to be an active Army unit. The brigade headquarters became part of U.S. Army Pacific on 16 June 2007.

The brigade had originally been slated to relocate to Fort Lewis, Washington to replace the 555th Engineer Brigade, which was scheduled to be inactivated. But with the announcement of the Grow the Army plan in early 2007, it was decided that no engineer brigades would be inactivated permanently, and the 130th Engineer Brigade would be moved to Hawaii instead. Both the 130th and 555th Engineer Brigades remained on active duty.

The brigade was inactive for a year while it was reconstructed in Hawaii. As a part of the transformation of the US Army, the brigade was reorganized into a modular force with new and updated equipment and new personnel. The Brigade stood up provisionally on 27 June 2008 as it neared ready status. On 23 October, the brigade&#x27;s colors were formally uncased at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. This signified the end of the brigade&#x27;s relocation to Hawaii as well as its completion and readiness to take on new missions.

The brigade took command of the 6th, 65th and 84th Engineer battalions.

=== Third tour in Iraq ===
The brigade was alerted for another deployment to Operation Iraqi Freedom in summer 2009. There, its missions will once again include construction, route clearance, and training of Iraqi engineers. Since being alerted for deployment, the brigade began conducting vigorous Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRE) training at Schofield Barracks. Among this training has been updated strategies for detection and clearance of Improvised Explosive Devices. The brigade began its deployment on 17 July 2009, uncasing its colors in Mosul and taking command of construction projects in the area from the 18th Engineer Brigade.

The 130th Engineer Brigade returned to Schofield Barracks Hawaii from Iraq on 4 June 2010.

=== Theater Security Cooperation Program Exercises ===
Upon the 130th Engineer Brigade&#x27;s return from Iraq in 2010, the 130th Engineer Brigade served as the Theater Engineer Brigade in the PACOM AOR. In this capacity, the brigade provided combat engineering, construction engineering and dive operations support to joint and combined partners at more than 30 Theater Security Cooperation Program (TSCP) exercises and multiple company sized deployments to Operations New Dawn and Enduring Freedom.

The 130th Engineer Brigade served as the Combined Joint Civil Military Operations Task Force (CJMOTF) for Balikatan 2011 in the Philippines. For over two months, the brigade headquarters along with platoons from the 84th Engineer Battalion built schools and all-purpose facilities. Meanwhile, the brigade&#x27;s subordinate joint partners conducted veterinarian and medical events to help improve the lives of the Filipino people. This event sharpened the brigade&#x27;s skills at responding to humanitarian aid and disaster response (HADR) events throughout the region. Upon completion of BK11, the brigade shifted its training focus from stability operations to major combat operations. Specifically, the brigade initiated a 9-month train-up plan for its MCTP graded war-fighter with the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea. Through a series of individual and collective training events the brigade honed, sharpened and in some cases re-learned the skills necessary to achieve victory in a high-intensity conflict. Through UFG12, 2ID&#x27;s War-Path II Exercise, and finally the Full Spectrum Exercise in November 2011, the 130th Engineer Brigade earned some of the highest marks and accolades ever given to a brigade by the MCTP during a certification war-fighter exercise. Through these series of exercises, the 130th Engineer Brigade helped USFK, 8th Army, and 2ID refine and improve their most significant OPLANs by updating TPFDDs, task organizations, engineer concepts of operations, and combined arms gap-crossing plans. The 130th Engineer Brigade, along with 8th Army and 2ID remain ready to &quot;Fight Tonight&quot; if called upon.

=== Operation Enduring Freedom ===
The 130th Engineer Brigade Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), and one of their subordinate battalions, the 65th Engineer Battalion (Combat Effects), deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in September and October 2013. This marked the brigade headquarters&#x27; first deployment to Afghanistan. After a two-week handover period, the 130th Engineer Brigade officially took over on 2 October 2013 from the 555th Engineer Brigade (from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA), Joint Task Force Triple Nickel, thus becoming Joint Task Force Sapper, overseeing U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force engineer units across Afghanistan. A direct subordinate element of ISAF Joint Command and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, JTF Sapper constituted the fourth largest command in theater, behind only regional commands. The 130th Engineer Brigade became the core of a provisional multi-role brigade headquarters for engineer operations in Afghanistan with seven subordinate battalions, one Naval Mobile Construction Battalion, and one Engineer Prime Beef Squadron consisting of over 4,200 Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen operating in each Regional Command.

From September to December 2013, Joint Task Force Sapper&#x27;s mission in theater was &quot;The Theater Engineer Brigade trains, certifies and advises the ANA Engineers on construction, facility management, and assured mobility capabilities while supporting the retrograde of Coalition Forces through expeditionary construction and assured mobility across the CJOA-A.&quot;

From January to May 2014, Joint Task Force Sapper&#x27;s mission in theater was &quot;Joint Task Force Sapper partners with ANA engineers to enable their independent operations and support the redeployment and retrograde of Coalition Forces through expeditionary construction and deconstruction across the CJOA-A in order to set the conditions for the resolute support mission.&quot;

The 130th Engineer Brigade turned over responsibility as Operation Enduring Freedom&#x27;s Theater Engineer Brigade to the 2nd Engineer Brigade (from Joint Base Elmedorf-Richardson, AK), Joint Task Force Trailblazer, on 29 May 2014. The 130th Engineer Brigade returned to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii from Afghanistan on 4 June 2014.

<text>The Solicitor General of Canada () was a position in the Canadian ministry from 1892 to 2005. The position was based on the Solicitor General in the British system and was originally designated as an officer to assist the Attorney General and Minister of Justice. It was not initially a position in the Canadian Cabinet, although after 1917 its occupant was often sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and attended Cabinet meetings. In 1966, the modern position of Solicitor General was created with the repeal of the previous Solicitor General Act and the passage of a new statute creating the ministerial office of the Solicitor General of Canada.

In recent decades the Solicitor General&#x27;s department was responsible for administering the prison system, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the National Parole Board and other matters relating to internal security. In 2003, the position was styled Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, and the portfolio expanded. In 2005, the position of Solicitor General was formally abolished.

<text>The song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) is a medium-sized New World sparrow. Among the native sparrows in North America, it is easily one of the most abundant, variable and adaptable species.

==Description==
Adult song sparrows have brown upperparts with dark streaks on the back and are white underneath with dark streaking and a dark brown spot in the middle of the breast. They have a brown cap and a long brown rounded tail. Their face is gray with a brown streak through each eye. They are highly variable in size across numerous subspecies (for subspecies details, see below). The body length ranges from and wingspan can range from . Body mass ranges from . The average of all races is but the widespread nominate subspecies (&quot;M. m. melodia&quot;) weighs only about on average. The maximum lifespan in the wild is 11.3 years. The eggs of the song sparrow are brown with greenish-white spots. Females lay three to five eggs per clutch, with an average incubation time of 13–15 days before hatching.

In the field, they are most easily confused with the Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow and the Savannah sparrow. The former can be recognized by its shorter, grayer tail and the differently-patterned head, the brown cheeks forming a clear-cut angular patch. The Savannah sparrow has a forked tail and yellowish flecks on the face when seen up close.

==Distribution and life history==
Though a habitat generalist, the song sparrow favors brushland and marshes, including salt marshes across most of Canada and the United States. They also thrive in human dominated areas such as in suburbs, agricultural fields, and along roadsides. Permanent residents of the southern half of their range, northern populations of the song sparrow migrate to the southern United States or Mexico during winter and intermingle with the native, non-migratory population. The song sparrow is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, with a few recorded in Great Britain and Norway.

These birds forage on the ground, in shrubs or in very shallow water. They eat mainly insects and seeds. Birds in salt marshes may also eat small crustaceans. They nest either in a sheltered location on the ground or in trees or shrubs. Song sparrows with areas of shrub cover in their territory, away from the intertidal coastline, have greater over-winter survival, as well as higher reproductive success.

== Physiology ==
The song sparrow has been the subject of several studies detailing the physiological reactions of bird species to conditions such as daylight length and differing climatic conditions. Most birds gain mass in their reproductive organs in response to some signal, either internal or external as the breeding season approaches. The exact source of this signal varies from species to species – for some, it is an endogenous process separate from environmental cues, while other species require extensive external signals of changing daylight length and temperature before beginning to increase the mass of their reproductive organs. Male specimens of &quot;M. melodia&quot; gain significant testicular mass in response both to changes in the daily photoperiod and as a result of endogenous chemical signals. Females also undergo significant ovarian growth in response to both photo-period and endogenous signals. Hormone levels in both males and females fluctuate throughout the breeding season, having very high levels in March and late April and then declining until May. These studies suggest that there are multiple factors at work that influence when and how the song sparrow breeds other than just increasing day length.

Due to the myriad subspecies of the song sparrow and the extremely varied climate of southern California, where many of these subspecies make their homes, physiological studies were undertaken to determine how climatic conditions and local environment influenced the bill size of &quot;M. melodia&quot; subspecies. The bill of a bird is highly important for thermoregulation as the bare surface area makes a perfect place to radiate excess heat or absorb solar energy to maintain homeostasis. Knowing this, comparisons of bill length between individual song sparrows collected in different habitats were made with regard to the primary habitat type or microclimate that they were collected in. Larger beaked subspecies were strongly correlated with hotter microclimates - a correlation that follows from the conditions of Allen&#x27;s Rule.

==Song==

The sparrow species derives its name from its colorful repertoire of songs. Enthusiasts report that one of the songs heard often in suburban locations closely resembles the opening four notes of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5. The male uses a fairly complex song to declare ownership of its territory and attract females.

Singing itself consists of a combination of repeated notes, quickly passing isolated notes, and trills. The songs are very crisp, clear, and precise, making them easily distinguishable by human ears. A particular song is determined by not only pitch and rhythm but also the timbre of the trills. Although one bird will know many songs—as many as 20 different tunes with as many as 1000 improvised variations on the basic theme,—unlike thrushes, the song sparrow usually repeats the same song many times before switching to a different song.

Song sparrows typically learn their songs from a handful of other birds that have neighboring territories. They are most likely to learn songs that are shared between these neighbors. Ultimately, they will choose a territory close to or replacing the birds that they have learned from. This allows the song sparrows to address their neighbors with songs shared with those neighbors. It has been demonstrated that song sparrows are able to distinguish neighbors from strangers on the basis of song, and also that females are able to distinguish (and prefer) their mate&#x27;s songs from those of other neighboring birds, and they prefer songs of neighboring birds to those of strangers.

A 2022 study by Duke University also found that male song sparrows memorize a 30-minute long playlist of their songs and use that information to curate both their current playlist and the following one. The findings suggest that male song sparrows deliberately shuffle and repeat their songs possibly to keep a female&#x27;s attention.

==Predators and parasites==
Common predators of the song sparrow include cats, hawks, and owls; however snakes, dogs, and the American kestrel are treated ambiguously, suggesting that they are less of a threat. The song sparrow recognizes enemies by both instinctual and learned patterns (including cultural learning), and adjusts its future behavior based on both its own experiences in encounters, and from watching other birds interact with the enemies. Comparisons of experiments on hand-raised birds to observation of birds in the wild suggest that the fear of owls and hawks is instinctual, but fear of cats is learned.

Song sparrows&#x27; nests are parasitized by the brown-headed cowbird. The cowbirds&#x27; eggs closely resemble song sparrows&#x27; eggs, although the cowbirds&#x27; eggs are slightly larger. Song sparrows recognize cowbirds as a threat and attack the cowbirds when they are near the nest. There is some evidence that this behavior is learned rather than instinctual. A more recent study found that the behavior of attacking female cowbirds near nests may actually attract cowbird parasitism because the female cowbirds use such behavior to identify female song sparrows that are more likely to successfully raise a cowbird chick. One study found that while cowbird parasitism did result in more nest failure, overall there were negligible effects on song sparrow populations when cowbirds were introduced to an island. The study pointed to a number of explanatory factors including song sparrows raising multiple broods, and song sparrows&#x27; abilities to raise cowbird chicks with their own.

==Subspecies==

The song sparrow is one of the most polytypic bird species in North America, rivaling other variable species on a global scale, such as the horned lark, the yellow wagtail, the golden whistler, and the island thrush. There have been a total of 52 subspecies named altogether, of which 25 are still recognized following a systematic morphological review. A high quality reference genome has recently been created for this species, which will allow for comprehensive genomic analyses of the differences between the several morphologically diverged subspecies.

===Eastern group===
Small, brownish, long-winged forms with strong black streaks.
* &quot;Melospiza melodia melodia&quot; . The nominate subspecies. Eastern half of North American range except coastal areas south from New York State. In winter, they migrate southeastwards. Very contrasting, very light with black streaks below, and gray margins to back feathers. This population includes the forms named as &quot;M. m. juddi&quot; ; &quot;M. m. acadica&quot; ; &quot;M. m. beata&quot; ; &quot;M. m. euphonia&quot; ; &quot;M. m. callima&quot; ; and &quot;M. m. melanchra&quot; .
* &quot;Melospiza melodia atlantica&quot; . Inhabits the Atlantic Coast sand dunes and salt marshes from New York State southwards. Differs from nominate by a gray back. Includes &quot;M. m. rossignolii&quot; .
* &quot;Melospiza melodia montana&quot; . The subspecies west of &quot;melodia&quot; to the Rocky Mountains. Some birds from the northern part of its range migrate to north-west Mexico in winter. Similar to nominate, but larger, duller coloration and more slender bill. Includes &quot;M. m. fisherella&quot; .

===Northwestern group===
Large, dark, diffuse dark streaks. A study of mtDNA allozyme variation of most forms in this group concluded that they are of comparatively recent origin and that island populations are apparently derived independently from each other.
* &quot;Melospiza melodia maxima&quot; , giant song sparrow. W Aleutian Islands (Attu to Atka Island), resident. The largest subspecies, about the size of the California towhee. Very gray overall, long, diffuse streaks. Bill long and slender.
* &quot;Melospiza melodia sanaka&quot; , Aleutian song sparrow. Aleutians from Seguam Island east to Stepovak Bay, Alaska, and islands to the south of Alaskan Peninsula; resident. Similar to &quot;maxima&quot;; grayer still and bill even more slender. Includes the Semidi song sparrow, &quot;M. m. semidiensis&quot; , which may be a distinct subspecies however. Also includes the population from Amak Island named &quot;M. m. amaka&quot; (Amak song sparrow) which was extirpated due to habitat destruction, apparently disappearing in the weeks around New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1980/1981 (there were unconfirmed sightings in 1987 and 1988).
* &quot;Melospiza melodia insignis&quot; , Bischoff song sparrow. Kodiak, Afognak, Sitkalidak, and Raspberry Islands, and Kukak and Katmai on Alaska Peninsula; many migrate south in winter. A darkish gray, medium-sized form.

<doc id="341782" wikidata="Q3455019" url="?curid=341782" title="Scarsdale diet">
<text>The Scarsdale diet, a high-protein low-carbohydrate fad diet designed for weight loss, created in the 1970s by Herman Tarnower and named for the town in New York where he practiced cardiology, is described in the book &quot;The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet Plus Dr. Tarnower&#x27;s Lifetime Keep-Slim Program.&quot; Tarnower wrote the book together with self-help author Samm Sinclair Baker.

==Overview==

The diet is similar to the Atkins Diet and Stillman diet in calling for a high protein low-carbohydrate diet, but also emphasizes the importance of fruits and vegetables. The diet restricts certain foods but allows an unrestricted amount of animal protein, especially eggs, fish, lean meats and poultry. To eat on Sundays, the diet recommends &quot;plenty of steak&quot; with tomatoes, celery or brussels sprouts. The Scarsdale diet is low-calorie, restricted to 1,000 calories per day and lasts between seven and fourteen days.

The book was originally published in 1978 and received an unexpected boost in popular sales when its author, Herman Tarnower, was murdered in 1980 by his jilted lover Jean Harris. During her trial, Harris&#x27; lawyer argued that she had been the book&#x27;s &quot;primary author&quot;.

==Health risks==

Medical experts have listed the Scarsdale diet as an example of a fad diet, as it carries potential health risks and does not instill the kind of healthy eating habits required for sustainable weight loss. It is unbalanced because of the high amount of meat consumed. The diet&#x27;s high fat ratio may increase the risk of heart disease. People following the diet can lose much weight at first, but this loss is generally not sustained any better than with normal calorie restriction.

Nutritionist Elaine B. Feldman has commented that high-protein low-carbohydrate diets such as the Atkins and Scarsdale diets are nutritionally deficient, produce diuresis and are &quot;clearly unphysiologic and may be hazardous&quot;. The Scarsdale diet was criticized by Henry Buchwald and colleagues for &quot;serious nutritional deficiencies&quot;. Negative effects of the diet include constipation, nausea, weakness and bad breath due to ketosis. The diet has also been criticized for being deficient in vitamin A and riboflavin.

<text>Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, (December 19, 1851 – June 17, 1942) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as Minister of Justice of Canada, as Chief Justice of Canada and then as Lieutenant Governor of Quebec.

== Biography ==
Fitzpatrick was born in Quebec City, Canada East, to John Fitzpatrick and Mary Connolly. He studied at Laval University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree (1873) and a Bachelor of Laws degree (1876), receiving the Dufferin Silver Medal. Called to the bar of Quebec in 1876, he established his practice in Quebec City and later founded the law firm of Fitzpatrick &amp; Taschereau.
In 1885, he acted as chief counsel to Louis Riel, who was on trial for leading the North-West Rebellion. Riel was found guilty and sentenced to death.

Fitzpatrick entered politics in 1890, winning election to the Quebec Legislative Assembly in the Québec-Comté electoral district. He was re-elected in 1892, but he resigned in June 1896 to enter federal politics.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the Quebec County electoral district in the 1896 federal election as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP). He served as Solicitor General of Canada from 1896 to 1902, and as Minister of Justice from 1902 until 1906. In 1905, he took part, as the federal government representative, in the negotiations that led to the creation of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1906 as Chief Justice. He served in that position until 1918, when he was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the 12th since Confederation. Partway through his term as Lieutenant Governor, his wife&#x27;s nephew (Louis-Alexandre Taschereau) became the Premier of Quebec.

He is the only Chief Justice other than Sir William Buell Richards to have served in that position without having first been a Puisne Justice on the court (Richards was Chief Justice at the court&#x27;s creation in 1875), and the only Chief Justice to have been appointed without any prior judicial experience.

== Personal life ==
On May 20, 1879, Fitzpatrick married Marie-Elmire-Corinne Caron. She was the daughter of René-Édouard Caron, 2nd Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, and his wife Marie-Joséphine De Blois.

He was knighted in 1907. Fitzpatrick died on June 17, 1942, at the age of 90 years and 6 months. He is interred in Sillery, at Saint-Michel Cemetery (cimetière Saint-Michel de Sillery).

<text>The American tree sparrow (Spizelloides arborea), also known as the winter sparrow, is a medium-sized New World sparrow.

== Taxonomy ==
In 2014, the American tree sparrow was moved to its own monotypic genus, &quot;Spizelloides&quot;, from genus &quot;Spizella&quot;, based on polyphyly in &quot;Spizella&quot; and multilocus molecular evidence suggesting the species was strongly divergent from other extant genera. 
== Description ==
Measurements:

* Length: 5.5 in (14 cm)
* Weight: 0.5–1.0 oz (13–28 g)
* Wingspan: 9.4 in (24 cm)

Adults have a rusty cap and grey underparts with a small dark spot on the breast. They have a rusty back with lighter stripes, brown wings with white bars and a slim tail. Their face is grey with a rusty line through the eye. Their flanks are splashed with light brown. They are similar in appearance to the chipping sparrow.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Their breeding habitat is tundra or the northern limits of the boreal forest in Alaska and northern Canada. They nest on the ground. American tree sparrows migrate into southern Canada and the United States to spend the winter.

== Diet and behavior ==
These birds forage on the ground or in low bushes, often in flocks when not nesting. They mainly eat seeds and insects, but also eat some berries. They are commonly seen near feeders with dark-eyed juncos.

=== Call ===
This bird&#x27;s song is a sweet high warble descending in pitch and becoming buzzy near the finish.

<doc id="341798" wikidata="Q717220" url="?curid=341798" title="Googie architecture">
<text>Googie architecture ( ) is a type of futurist architecture influenced by car culture, jets, the Atomic Age and the Space Age. It originated in Southern California from the Streamline Moderne architecture of the 1930s, and was popular in the United States from roughly 1945 to the early 1970s.

Googie-themed architecture was popular among roadside businesses, including motels, coffee houses and gas stations. The style later became widely known as part of the mid-century modern style, elements of which represent the populuxe aesthetic, as in Eero Saarinen&#x27;s TWA Terminal. The term &quot;Googie&quot; comes from the now-defunct Googies Coffee Shop in Hollywood designed by John Lautner. Similar architectural styles are also referred to as Populuxe or Doo Wop.

Features of Googie include upswept roofs, curvilinear, geometric shapes, and bold use of glass, steel and neon. Googie was also characterized by Space Age designs symbolic of motion, such as boomerangs, flying saucers, diagrammatic atoms and parabolas, and free-form designs such as &quot;soft&quot; parallelograms and an artist&#x27;s palette motif. These stylistic conventions represented American society&#x27;s fascination with Space Age themes and marketing emphasis on futuristic designs. As with the Art Deco style of the 1910s–1930s, Googie became less valued as time passed, and many buildings in this style have been destroyed. Some examples have been preserved, though, such as the oldest McDonald&#x27;s stand (located in Downey, California).

==Origins==

The origin of the name Googie dates to 1949, when architect John Lautner designed the Googies Coffee Shop in Hollywood, which had distinct architectural characteristics. The name &quot;Googie&quot; had been a family nickname of Lillian K. Burton, the wife of the restaurant&#x27;s original owner, Mortimer C. Burton, and aunt of musician Peter Matz.

Googies was located at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights in Los Angeles but was demolished in 1989. The name Googie became a rubric for the architectural style when editor Douglas Haskell of &quot;House and Home&quot; magazine and architectural photographer Julius Shulman were driving through Los Angeles one day. Haskell insisted on stopping the car upon seeing Googies and proclaimed &quot;This is Googie architecture.&quot; He popularized the name after an article he wrote appeared in a 1952 edition of &quot;House and Home&quot; magazine.

Though Haskell coined the term Googie and was an advocate of modernism, he did not appreciate the Googie aesthetic. In his article he used the fictional Professor Thrugg&#x27;s overly effusive praise to mock Googie, at the same time lampooning Hollywood, which he felt informed the aesthetic.

==History==

Googie&#x27;s beginnings are with the Streamline Moderne architecture of the 1930s. Alan Hess, one of the most knowledgeable writers on the subject, writes in &quot;Googie: Ultra Modern Road Side Architecture&quot; that mobility in Los Angeles during the 1930s was characterized by the initial influx of the automobile and the service industry that evolved to cater to it. With car ownership increasing, cities no longer had to be centered on a central downtown but could spread out to the suburbs, where business hubs could be interspersed with residential areas. The suburbs offered less congestion by offering the same businesses, but accessible by car. Instead of one main store downtown, businesses now had multiple stores in suburban areas. This new trend required owners and architects to develop a visual imagery so customers would recognize it from the road. This modern consumer architecture was based on communication.

The new smaller suburban drive-in restaurants were essentially architectural signboards advertising the business to vehicles on the road. This was achieved by using bold style choices, including large pylons with elevated signs, bold neon letters and circular pavilions. Hess writes that because of the increase in mass production and travel during the 1930s, Streamline Moderne became popular because of the high energy silhouettes its sleek designs created. These buildings featured rounded edges, large pylons and neon lights, all symbolizing, according to Hess, &quot;invisible forces of speed and energy&quot;, that reflect the influx of mobility that cars, locomotives and zeppelins brought.

Streamline Moderne, much like Googie, was styled to look futuristic to signal the beginning of a new era – that of the automobile and other technologies. Drive-in services such as diners, movie theaters and filling stations built with the same principles developed to serve the new American city. Drive-ins had advanced car-oriented architectural design, as they were built with an expressive utilitarian style, circular and surrounded by a parking lot, allowing all customers equal access from their cars. These developments in consumer-oriented design set the stage for Googie during the 1950s, since during the 1940s World War II and rationing caused a pause of development because of the imposed frugality on the American public.

With the increasing prosperity of the United States during the 1950s, however, American designers celebrated this new affluence with optimistic designs. The development of nuclear power and the reality of spaceflight captivated the public&#x27;s imagination of the future. Googie architecture exploited this trend by incorporating energy into its design with elements such as the boomerang, diagonals, atomic bursts and bright colors. According to Hess, commercial architecture was influenced by the desires of the mass audience. The public was captivated by rocket ships and nuclear energy, so, in order to draw their attention, architects used these as motifs in their work. Buildings had been used to catch the attention of motorists since the invention of the car, but during the 1950s the style became more widespread.
The identity of the first architect to practice in the style is often disputed, though Wayne McAllister was one early and influential architect in starting the style with his 1949 Bob&#x27;s Big Boy restaurant in Burbank. McAllister got his start designing fashionable restaurants in Southern California, which led to a series of Streamline Moderne drive-ins during the 1930s; though he did not have formal training as an architect, he had been offered a scholarship at the architecture school at the University of Pennsylvania because of his skill. McAllister developed a brand for coffee shop chains by developing a style for each client – which also allowed customers to easily recognize a store from the road.

Along with McAllister, the prolific Googie architects included John Lautner, Douglas Honnold, and the team of Louis Armet and Eldon Davis of Armet &amp; Davis firm, which they founded in 1947. Also instrumental in developing the style was designer Helen Liu Fong, a member of the firm of Armet and Davis. Joining the firm during 1951, she created such Googie interiors as those of the Johnie&#x27;s Coffee Shop on Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, the first Norms Restaurant, and the Holiday Bowl on Crenshaw Boulevard.

America&#x27;s interest in spaceflight had a significant influence on the unique style of Googie architecture. During the 1950s, space travel became a reality for the first time in history. In 1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I, the first human-made satellite to achieve Earth orbit. The Soviet Union then launched Vostok 1 carrying the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into Earth orbit in 1961. The Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations made competing with the Soviets for dominance in space a national priority of considerable urgency and importance. This marked the beginning of the so-called &quot;Space Race&quot;.

Googie-style signs usually boast sharp and bold angles, intended to suggest the aerodynamic features of a rocket ship. Also, at the time, the unique architecture was a form of architectural expressionism, as space rockets were technological novelties at the time.

==Characteristics==

Cantilevered structures, acute angles, illuminated plastic paneling, freeform boomerang and artist&#x27;s palette shapes and cutouts, and tailfins on buildings marked Googie architecture, which was contemptible to some architects of then-current High Art Modernism, but had defenders during the post-Modern period at the end of the 20th century. The common elements that generally distinguish Googie from other forms of architecture are:

* Roofs sloping at an upward angle: This is the one particular element in which architects were creating a unique structure. Many Googie style coffee shops, and other structures, have a roof that appears to be of an inverted obtuse triangle. An example of this is the famous, but now closed, Johnie&#x27;s Coffee Shop on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.
* Starbursts: Starbursts are an ornament that is common with the Googie style, showing its Space Age and whimsical influences. Perhaps the most notable example of the starburst appears on the &quot;Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas&quot; sign. The ornamental design is in the form of, as Hess writes, &quot;a high-energy explosion&quot;. This shape is an example of non-utilitarian design, as the star shape has no actual function but merely serves as a design element.

The boomerang shape was another design element that captured movement. It was used structurally in place of a pillar or aesthetically as a stylized arrow. Hess writes that the boomerang was a stylistic rendering of a directional energy field.

Editor Douglas Haskell described the abstract Googie style, saying that &quot;If it looks like a bird, this must be a geometric bird.&quot; Also, the buildings must appear to defy gravity, as Haskell noted: &quot;whenever possible, the building must hang from the sky&quot;. Haskell&#x27;s third tenet for Googie was that it have more than one theme—more than one structural system. Because of its need to be noticed from moving automobiles along the commercial strip, Googie was not a style noted for its subtlety.

One of the more famous Googie buildings is the Theme Building at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), designed by James Langenheim of William Pereira and Charles Luckman and built during 1961.

One of the remaining Googie-styled drive-in restaurants, Harvey&#x27;s Broiler (Paul Clayton, 1958), later Johnie&#x27;s Broiler in Downey, California, was partially demolished in 2006. However, through the efforts of citizens, the city of Downey, and historic preservationists, the structure was rebuilt and reopened in 2009 as a Bob&#x27;s Big Boy restaurant.

Another remaining example of Googie architecture still in operation is the main terminal at Washington Dulles International Airport, designed by Eero Saarinen in 1958. This terminal exemplifies the dramatic roof slope, large windows, and generous use of concrete, somewhat similar to Saarinen&#x27;s TWA Flight Center.

==Districts==

Classic locations for Googie style buildings are Miami Beach, Florida, where secondary commercial structures were adapted from the resort style of Morris Lapidus and other hotel designers; the first phase of Las Vegas, Nevada; and their birthplace of Southern California.

===Wildwood, New Jersey===

The beachfront resort town of Wildwood, New Jersey, features an array of motel designs, colorfully described by such sub-styles as Vroom, Pu-Pu Platter, Phony Colonee and more. The district is known collectively as the Wildwoods Shore Resort Historic District by the State of New Jersey.

The term &quot;doo-wop&quot; was used by New Jersey&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts during the early 1990s to describe the unique, space-age architectural style. Many of Wildwood&#x27;s Doo-Wop motels were built by Lou Morey, who specialized in such designs. His Ebb Tide Motel, built during 1957 and demolished during 2003, is credited as the first Doo-Wop motel in Wildwood Crest.

==Decline and preservation==

After the 1960s, following the Apollo 11 Moon landing, the rise of ecology movements against nuclear power, and the de-escalations of the Space Race and the Atomic Age, Googie began to fall out of style. The architectural community rarely appreciated or accepted Googie, considering it too flashy and vernacular for academic praise, and so the architecture of the 1970s, especially the International Style, shunned Googie. As Hess notes, beginning during the 1970s, commercial buildings were meant to blend into the urban environment and not attract attention. By the mid 1960s, the novelty of Googie was starting to wane and there was a backlash against the flashy style.

Since Googie buildings were usually part of the service industry, most developers did not think they were worth preserving as cultural artifacts. The publication of Googie by Alan Hess in 1986 inspired a new appreciation for the style. Despite the humble origins of Googie, Hess writes that, &quot;Googie architecture is an important part of the history of suburbia.&quot; Googie was a symbol of the early days of car culture.

One of the earliest organizations in the US that advocated for the preservation of Googie architecture was the Los Angeles Conservancy Modern Committee, which was formed in 1984 in response to the demolition of Ship&#x27;s coffee shop in Westwood and Tiny Naylor&#x27;s Drive-In in Hollywood. Despite the loss of these and the original Googie&#x27;s in Hollywood, other Googie coffee shops including Norms Restaurants, Johnie&#x27;s Coffee Shop, and the Wich Stand have received historic designations. The world&#x27;s oldest McDonald&#x27;s in Downey and the earliest remaining Bob&#x27;s Big Boy in Burbank, have also been preserved and restored.

In Wildwood, New Jersey, a &quot;Doo Wop Preservation League&quot; works with local business and property owners, city planning and zoning officials, and the state&#x27;s historic preservation office, to help ensure that the remaining historic structures will be preserved. Wildwood&#x27;s high-rise hotel district has been the first in the US to enforce &quot;Doo Wop&quot; design guidelines for new construction.

==Neo-Googie architecture==
The architect Michael Hsu designed multiple restaurants for the Austin-based restaurant P. Terry&#x27;s in the Googie style. Each location is uniquely designed, featuring oblique shapes, color, and large geometric roofs.

==Influence==
Googie architecture developed from the futuristic architecture of Streamline Moderne, extending and reinterpreting technological themes for the new conditions of the 1950s. While 1930s architecture was relatively simple, Googie embraced opulence. Hess argues that the reason for this was that the vision of the future of the 1930s was obsolete by 1950 and thus the architecture evolved along with it. During the 1930s, Streamlined trains and Lincoln-Zephyrs had been advanced technology, and Streamline Moderne paralleled their smooth simplified aerodynamic exteriors. That simplicity may have represented the Depression era&#x27;s forced frugality.

The eye-catching Googie style flourished in a carnival atmosphere along multi-lane highways, in motel architecture and above all in commercial signage. The influence of Googie was prominently seen in the architecture and signage of Los Angeles and Las Vegas circa 1945–1970, where many of the same architects who designed Googie coffee shops in Los Angeles went on to design some of the seminal hotels and casinos in Las Vegas. Private clients were the main patrons of Googie. Ultimately, the style became unfashionable and, over time, numerous examples of the Googie style have either fallen into disrepair or been destroyed completely.

The exaggerated, once-futuristic Googie style exemplified in &quot;The Jetsons&quot; cartoons and the original Disneyland (which featured a Googie Tomorrowland) gave birth several decades later to retrofuturism. Googie was also the inspiration for the background art style of animated television series and movies such as &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;George Shrinks&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;, and &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, as well as the cover of the faux-memoir &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; by comedian Norm Macdonald.

<text>The Chilean dolphin (Cephalorhynchus eutropia), also known as the Black dolphin, is one of four dolphins in the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;. The dolphin is found only off the coast of Chile; it is commonly referred to in the country as &quot;tonina&quot;.

==Characteristics==

=== Physical description ===
The Chilean dolphin is small at around 1.7 metres (5 ft 7 in) in length, with a blunt head. Adults reach up to 60 kg, with females slightly larger than the male bulls. This dolphin is thickly shaped with its girth up to two-thirds its length. Their small and thick shape is often mistaken for other types of porpoises. The dorsal fin and flippers are small in proportion to body size in comparison with other dolphins. The throat, underside, and the closest part of the flippers to the body are white. The remainder of the body is a mix of greys. A black line connects their blowhole, eyes, and dorsal fin. It has 28–34 pairs of teeth in the upper jaw and 29–33 in the lower. The two eyes are positioned at the ends of the mouth lines, giving the appearance of a smile. The tail has a characteristic notch in the middle. The most distinct features of the Chilean dolphin are its short beak, round dorsal fin, and rounded flippers.

=== Behavior ===
Unlike other types of dolphins that commonly exhibit social behavior, the Chilean dolphin often remains distant during possible encounters with humans. The Chilean dolphin is normally sighted in small groups of around two to ten individuals, with some larger gatherings of up to 50 individuals occasionally sighted. A group of dolphins is referred to as a pod, school, or herd. The species exhibits epimeletic behavior, meaning that when one individual in the pod is injured or sick, healthy members will help take care of the sick.

=== Communication ===
Communication between individuals is performed with a series of clicks, whistles, and cries at varying frequencies. Chilean dolphins use echolocation to navigate their surroundings. They are able to perceive visual, tactile, acoustic, ultrasound, echolocation, and chemical information.

=== Reproduction ===
Little is known about the reproduction of the Chilean dolphin. They mate in the early winter and females give birth to their offspring in the spring. Female dolphins, known as cows, usually have one calf every two to three years. Calves reach full maturity between ages 5 and 9 years. Young calves are cared for by their mothers, where they learn to forage and navigate social behavior.

=== Lifespan ===
Longevity, gestation, and lactation periods are not known, but are believed to be similar in length to the more studied, and similar, Hector&#x27;s and Commerson&#x27;s dolphins which have a gestation period of about 10 months to one year and maximum longevity of 20 years.

=== Diet ===
The Chilean dolphin primarily feeds on sardines, anchovies, salmon, squid, crustaceans, and green algae. They swim in a circular or zig-zag pattern to herd the fish that they eat.

==Population and distribution==

The population of the Chilean dolphin, perhaps one of the least studied of all cetaceans, is not known with certainty. It is estimated that less than 5,000 Chilean dolphins remain in the wild. Whatever its number, the Chilean dolphin is endemic to the coast of Chile, meaning it is no found anywhere else in the world. They are believed to not migrate. The dolphin is seen over a wider interval of latitudes than other &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; species — from Valparaíso at 33°S to Cape Horn at 55°S. Larger groups of 20-50 are found in the northern areas of its habitat, including reports of a 15 mile-long pod. However, the majority of the Chilean dolphins population is found in the southern regions. The species prefers shallow water regions, specifically areas near rivers and high tides. The close association with riverine and estuarine ecosystems makes Chilean dolphins extremely vulnerable to habitat loss both from coastal and upstream river basin degradation. Their relatively limited distribution and need for specific environmental conditions makes the Chilean dolphin particularly susceptible to population loss, even in the most remote areas.
== Habitat ==
The Chilean dolphin is seen over a wider interval of latitudes than other &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; species — from Valparaíso at 33°S to Cape Horn at 55°S. In the northern areas, they are found in bays and estuaries with more exposed coastlines, while they prefer fjords and channels in the southern regions. They are commonly seen in bays and channels as well as near rivers and areas with greater changes in tide. Most Chilean dolphins reside in salt water, however they have been spotted in freshwater rivers. Additionally, Chilean dolphins prefer shallow waters, usually less than 20 meters, and tend to stay within 500 meters of shore. Research has found that pods are highly localized, and environmental factors often serve as barriers between pods.

== Threats ==
Humans pose the largest threat to the Chilean dolphin population. In addition to being caught for human consumption, the dolphins are also used as bait for long-line sword fishing and crab fisheries. It is reported that between 1,300 and 1,500 Chilean dolphins are harpooned in the Strait of Magellan each year. Use as bait was particularly popular until the 1990s, and hunting of Chilean dolphins is now illegal. Aquaculture farms for salmon, anti-sea lion nets, and boat traffic also pose as threats to the species. Since 2023, at least 14 Chilean dolphins have died as a result of widespread bird flu in Chile. Reports indicate that Chilean dolphins are preyed upon by killer whales and sharks. The increase of human activity near the Chilean coastline has also degraded the fragile shallow water habitat. Hydroelectric dams and inter-basin water transfer pose as significant threats to Chilean dolphins residing in freshwater rivers. 

==Conservation==

The Chilean dolphin is listed on Appendix II Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements. Initiatives established by Catholic University of the Maule (UCM) and the Environmental Protection Fund FPA of the National Environment Commission (Chile) aim to protect the natural habitat of the Chilean dolphin and provide safe tourism opportunities to view the dolphin.

==Name==
In the early part of the 20th century, the Chilean dolphin was commonly known as the black dolphin. This was later agreed to be a poor choice of name. Most of the few individual specimens studied by scientists were either washed-up individuals whose skin had darkened due to exposure to air or live specimens seen at sea but only at a distance (and so appeared darker than they were). As more specimens were studied, it became clear that the back of the dolphin was in fact a mixture of grey colors and that its underside was white. The scientific community is now universally agreed in naming the dolphin Chilean on account of its distribution along the coast of the country.

<doc id="341804" wikidata="Q709969" url="?curid=341804" title="Gija Joseon">
<text>Gija Joseon (1120–194 BC) was a dynasty of Gojoseon allegedly founded by the sage Jizi (Gija), a member of the Shang (Yin) dynasty royal house.

==Understanding before 20th century==
===Chinese records===
Chinese records before the Qin dynasty describe Gija (箕子) as the paternal uncle (or brother in other records) of the last king of the Shang dynasty, the tyrannical King Zhou, but contain no mention of king Zhou&#x27;s relationship with Gojoseon. Gija was imprisoned by the tyrant until the downfall of Shang Kingdom, when King Wu of Zhou released him.

Records written after the Qin dynasty, when the Han dynasty and Gojoseon were at war, add that Gija led 5,000 to the east of present-day Beijing, as written in the &quot;Geography&quot; section of the &quot;Book of Han&quot; (although some, especially in China, believe him to have moved to present-day Korea), and became the founding king of Gija Joseon. In Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shi Ji&quot;, Gija is mentioned in the following sentence:

&quot;King Wu enfeoffed Gija to Joseon, though he was not a vassal (of Zhou)&quot;

(於是武王乃封箕子於朝鮮而不臣也).

===Korean historiography===
No contemporary Korean sources existed for Gija Joseon, and the oldest sources produced in Korea were from the Goryeo dynasty. The earliest Korean record about Gija Joseon can be seen from &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;,
Later Dangun moved his capital to Asadal on T&#x27;aebaek-san and ruled 1500 years, until king Wu of Chou (ancient Chinese dynasty) placed Kija on the throne (traditional date 1122 BC). When Kija arrived, Dangun moved to Changtang-kyong and then returned to Asadal, where he became a mountain god at the age of 1908.
(御國一千五百年. 周虎{武}王卽位己卯, 封箕子於朝鮮, 壇君乃移於藏唐京, 後還隱於阿斯達爲山神, 壽一千九百八歲),

It was widely believed that Gija Joseon was located on the Korean Peninsula, replacing Gojoseon of Dangun. But some Korean scholars believed that Gija settled west of Gojoseon, based on records from &quot;Geography&quot; section of the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, and the Korean &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; that suggests that Gojoseon continued to coexist with Gija Joseon after the migration of Gija. These scholars believed that Gija&#x27;s influence was limited to western part of Gojoseon.

The &quot;Genealogy of the Cheongju Han Clan&quot; (청주한씨세보) lists the names of 73 rulers of Gija Joseon and their periods of reign; however, it is not widely accepted by current Korean mainstream historians.

Wiman Joseon is said to begin with the usurpation of the throne from Jun of Gojoseon and the line of kings descended from Gija.

==Shin Chaeho&#x27;s opinion==
Shin Chaeho said that Gija Joseon (323 BC-194 BC) refers to the putative period of Beonjoseon, one of the Three Confederate States of Gojoseon, after the Marquess of Joseon from the Gi clan was invaded by Yan as shown in the records of Weilüe. Chinese traditional accounts indicate that Gihu&#x27;s ancestor, Gija, was the same person as Jizi (both written as 箕子 in Hanzi/Hanja).

According to Sin Chaeho&#x27;s Joseon Sangosa, Beonjoseon began disintegrating after its king had been killed by a rebel from the Chinese state of Yan at around 323 BC. With this, the five ministers of Beonjoseon began contending for the throne. Marquess of Joseon from the Gi clan joined in this struggle, and emerged victorious as the new king of Beonjoseon, defeating the competitors for the throne. He established Gija Joseon, named after his ancestor Gija. During Gija Joseon, the king enjoyed strong sovereign powers. Eventually, in 94 BC, Gija Joseon fell after King Jun was overthrown by Wiman, who established Wiman Joseon in its place.

==Controversy on whether Gija and Jizi were the same person==
The Korean historian Kim Jung-bae claims that the association between Jizi and Joseon is wrong. He believed that the existence of Gija Joseon as a state established by Jizi was fabricated during Han dynasty. He further claims that the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, and Confucius&#x27;s &quot;Analects&quot;, which was the earliest extant text that referred to Jizi, did not say anything about his going to Gojoseon. Similarly, the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, written soon after the conquest of Wiman Joseon by the Han dynasty, made no reference to Joseon in its discussions about Jizi and no reference to Jizi in its discussions about Joseon.

According to some sources, ancient Koreans claimed that Gija came from the Zhou dynasty but there is no archaeological evidence to support early involvement of the Chinese.

<text>Joseph Liouville ( , ; 24 March 1809 – 8 September 1882) was a French mathematician and engineer.

== Life and work ==
He was born in Saint-Omer in France on 24 March 1809. His parents were Claude-Joseph Liouville (an army officer) and Thérèse Liouville (née Balland).

Liouville gained admission to the École Polytechnique in 1825 and graduated in 1827. Just like Augustin-Louis Cauchy before him, Liouville studied engineering at École des Ponts et Chaussées after graduating from the Polytechnique, but opted instead for a career in mathematics. After some years as an assistant at various institutions including the École Centrale Paris, he was appointed as professor at the École Polytechnique in 1838. He obtained a chair in mathematics at the Collège de France in 1850 and a chair in mechanics at the Faculté des Sciences in 1857.

Besides his academic achievements, he was very talented in organisational matters. Liouville founded the &quot;Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées&quot; which retains its high reputation up to today, in order to promote other mathematicians&#x27; work. He was the first to read, and to recognize the importance of, the unpublished work of Évariste Galois which appeared in his journal in 1846. Liouville was also involved in politics for some time, and he became a member of the Constituting Assembly in 1848. However, after his defeat in the legislative elections in 1849, he turned away from politics.

Liouville worked in a number of different fields in mathematics, including number theory, complex analysis, differential geometry and topology, but also mathematical physics and even astronomy. He is remembered particularly for Liouville&#x27;s theorem in complex analysis. In number theory, he was the first to prove the existence of transcendental numbers by a construction using continued fractions (Liouville numbers). In mathematical physics, Liouville made two fundamental contributions: the Sturm–Liouville theory, which was joint work with Charles François Sturm, and is now a standard procedure to solve certain types of integral equations by developing into eigenfunctions, and the fact (also known as Liouville&#x27;s theorem) that time evolution is measure preserving for a Hamiltonian system. In Hamiltonian dynamics, Liouville also introduced the notion of action-angle variables as a description of completely integrable systems. The modern formulation of this is sometimes called the Liouville–Arnold theorem, and the underlying concept of integrability is referred to as Liouville integrability. Additionally, Liouville developed the Riemann-Liouville integral to consider differentiation and integration of a fractional order.

In 1851, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1853, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

The crater Liouville on the Moon is named after him. So is the Liouville function, an important function in number theory.

<doc id="341814" wikidata="Q382303" url="?curid=341814" title="Mariano Rivera">
<text>Mariano Rivera (born November 29, 1969) is a Panamanian-American former professional baseball pitcher who played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, from 1995 to 2013. Nicknamed &quot;Mo&quot; and &quot;Sandman&quot;, he spent most of his career as a relief pitcher and served as the Yankees&#x27; closer for 17 seasons. A thirteen-time All-Star and five-time World Series champion, he is MLB&#x27;s career leader in saves (652) and games finished (952). Rivera won five American League (AL) Rolaids Relief Man Awards and three Delivery Man of the Year Awards, and he finished in the top three in voting for the AL Cy Young Award four times. In 2019, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, and is to date the only player ever to be elected unanimously by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA).

Raised in the modest Panamanian fishing village of Puerto Caimito, Rivera was an amateur player until he was signed by the Yankees organization in 1990. He debuted in the major leagues in 1995 as a starting pitcher, before permanently converting to a relief pitcher late that year. After a breakthrough season in 1996 as a setup man, he became the Yankees&#x27; closer in 1997. In the following seasons, he established himself as one of baseball&#x27;s top relievers, leading the major leagues in saves in 1999, 2001, and 2004. Rivera primarily threw a sharp-moving, mid-90s mile-per-hour cut fastball that frequently broke hitters&#x27; bats and earned a reputation as one of the league&#x27;s toughest pitches to hit. With his presence at the end of games, signaled by his foreboding entrance song &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, Rivera was a key contributor to the Yankees&#x27; dynasty in the late 1990s and early 2000s that won four championships in five years. He was an accomplished postseason performer, winning the 1999 World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award and the 2003 AL Championship Series MVP Award, while setting postseason records that included lowest earned run average (ERA) (0.70) and most saves (42).

Rivera is considered one of the most dominant relievers in major league history. Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, he saved at least 25 games in 15 consecutive seasons and posted an ERA under 2.00 in 11 seasons, both of which are records. When he retired, his career 2.21 ERA and 1.00 WHIP were the lowest in the live-ball era among qualified pitchers. Fellow players credit him with popularizing the cut fastball across the major leagues. Along with his signature pitch, Rivera was known for his precise control, smooth pitching motion, and composure on the field. In 2013, the Yankees retired his uniform number 42; he was the last major league player to wear the number full time, following its league-wide retirement in 1997 in honor of Jackie Robinson. In 2014, MLB named its AL Reliever of the Year Award in Rivera&#x27;s honor. A devout Christian, he has been involved in charitable causes and the religious community through the Mariano Rivera Foundation. For his philanthropy, Rivera received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States, in September 2019.

==Early life==

Mariano Rivera was born on November 29, 1969, in Panama City, Panama, to Mariano Rivera Palacios and Delia Jiron. Rivera has one older sister, Delia, and two younger brothers, Alvaro and Giraldo. Supported by Mariano Sr.&#x27;s job as captain of a fishing boat, the family lived in Puerto Caimito, a Panamanian fishing village that Rivera described as &quot;poor&quot;. As a young man, Rivera played soccer and baseball with his friends on the beach during low tide. Soccer was his favorite sport, and Pelé his favorite athlete. For baseball games, they substituted cardboard milk cartons for gloves and tree branches for bats, and they fashioned balls by taping wads of shredded fishing nets. Rivera used this makeshift equipment until his father bought him his first leather glove when he was 12 years old. Speaking about his youth, Rivera said that although he stayed out of trouble, he &quot;was hanging with the wrong people&quot;.

Rivera attended Escuela Victoriano Chacón for elementary school and La Escuela Secundaria Pedro Pablo Sanchez for his secondary education, but he dropped out in ninth grade. At age 16, he began to learn the fishing trade by working on a commercial boat captained by his father, catching sardines. Rivera, who worked six-day weeks, year round, called the job &quot;extremely hard&quot; and was more interested in becoming a mechanic. He spent three years learning the fishing trade, saving the money he earned in hopes of opening an automobile repair shop. Two incidents on his father&#x27;s boat validated his doubts about fishing as a career. In 1988, Rivera&#x27;s uncle Miguel was lashed by an unsecured rope that shot off a hydraulic mechanism, and a month later he died from his injuries. About a year later, at age 19, Rivera was forced to abandon his father&#x27;s ship after it began capsizing due to a malfunctioning water pump and an overweight load of fish.

Rivera continued to play sports during his teenage years but eventually quit soccer around age 17 after a series of ankle and knee injuries. Consequently, he shifted his attention to baseball, though he considered it a hobby rather than a potential profession. At age 18, Rivera joined the Panamá Oeste Vaqueros, a local amateur baseball team, as a utility player. Scout Herb Raybourn watched him play shortstop in a 1988 baseball tournament but did not project him to be a major leaguer. A year later, Panamá Oeste&#x27;s pitcher performed so poorly in a playoff game that Rivera was asked to replace him, and despite no experience at the position, he pitched well. Teammates Claudino Hernández and Emilio Gáez consequently contacted Chico Heron, a scout for the New York Yankees. Two weeks after his pitching debut, Rivera was invited to a Yankees tryout camp run by Heron in Panama City. Raybourn, who had returned to Panama to scout as the Yankees&#x27; director of Latin American operations, received a tip about Rivera. Raybourn was surprised to hear he had switched positions but decided to watch him throw. Although Rivera had no formal pitching training, weighed just , and threw only , Raybourn was impressed by his athleticism and smooth, effortless pitching motion. Viewing Rivera as a raw talent, Raybourn signed the amateur free agent to a contract with the Yankees organization on February 17, 1990; the contract included a signing bonus of US$2,500 ($ today), according to Major League Baseball (MLB) records.

==Professional baseball career==

===Minor leagues (1990–1995)===
After signing his contract, Rivera—who spoke no English and had never left home before—flew to the United States and reported to the Gulf Coast League (GCL) Yankees, a Rookie level minor-league affiliate of the New York Yankees. Feeling lonely and homesick, he wrote home to his parents often, as they did not have access to telephones in Puerto Caimito. At that point in his career, scouts considered Rivera to be a &quot;fringe prospect&quot; at best, but he made progress with a strong 1990 season for the GCL Yankees. Pitching mostly in relief, he allowed only 24 baserunners and one earned run in 52 innings pitched—a 0.17 earned run average (ERA). The team permitted Rivera to start the season&#x27;s final game in order for him to accumulate enough innings pitched to qualify for the league&#x27;s ERA title (which carried a $500 bonus); his subsequent seven-inning no-hitter &quot;put him on the map with the organization&quot;, according to manager Glenn Sherlock. In the offseason, Rivera returned to Panama and tipped Raybourn off about a promising local player, Rivera&#x27;s 16-year-old cousin Rubén, whom the Yankees consequently signed. 

In 1991, Mariano was promoted to the Class A level Greensboro Hornets of the South Atlantic League, where he started 15 of the 29 games in which he pitched. Despite a 4–9 win–loss record, he recorded a 2.75 ERA in  innings pitched and struck out 123 batters while walking 36 batters. New York Yankees manager Buck Showalter took notice of Rivera&#x27;s strong strikeout-to-walk ratio, calling it &quot;impressive in any league&quot; and saying, &quot;This guy is going to make it.&quot; A minor-league scout for the Cincinnati Reds filed a report that season about Rivera that said: &quot;long arms w/ slender strong body, loose actions...will challenge in velocity...maturity is a question, consistency is a question...consistency will need to be maintained to improve and advance.&quot;

In 1992, Rivera was promoted to the Class A-Advanced level Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Florida State League (FSL), but he missed the first third of the season with elbow stiffness. He started ten games for Fort Lauderdale, compiling a 5–3 win–loss record and a 2.28 ERA, while walking only five batters in  innings pitched. Ultimately, Rivera was sidelined again after suffering damage to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his right elbow. The injury was attributed to him snapping his wrist during his throwing motion in an attempt to improve the movement of his slider. Rivera underwent elbow surgery on August 27, 1992, leading to concerns that he would be out through the 1993 season. Contrary to popular belief, the operation was not Tommy John surgery; Rivera&#x27;s surgeon, Frank Jobe, determined that ligament replacement was not necessary and instead repaired the frayed UCL. Rivera was left unprotected by the Yankees in MLB&#x27;s 1992 expansion draft, which filled the rosters for two expansion teams, the Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies. At one point in the draft, Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski was planning to select Rivera with his next pick, but after the Rockies chose Yankee Brad Ausmus, the Yankees were shielded from losing any more players; Rivera went undrafted.

During Rivera&#x27;s rehabilitation, he played catch with former Yankees pitchers Whitey Ford and Ron Guidry, and faced batting practice from his first minor-league pitching coach, former pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm. After recuperating, Rivera pitched an abbreviated 1993 season for the Rookie-level Yankees and Class A Greensboro, during which he was kept on a limited pitch count. Hornets shortstop Derek Jeter, who would later be Rivera&#x27;s teammate in the major leagues, tracked his pitch count during games. In 12 starts, Rivera recorded a 2.08 ERA, walking 16 batters in  innings pitched. Watching him recover, the Hornets&#x27; official scorer Ogi Overman was not optimistic about Rivera&#x27;s future, saying, &quot;I thought [he] was on a one-way trip to nowhere.&quot;

Rivera began the 1994 season with the Class A-Advanced level Tampa Yankees of the FSL. In June, he was promoted to the Double-A level Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Eastern League, followed by a promotion to the Triple-A level Columbus Clippers of the International League in July. Rivera finished his season with a 10–2 record and a 3.09 ERA overall, but he struggled in Columbus, recording a 5.81 ERA in six starts. At the start of the 1995 season, he was ranked the ninth-best prospect in the Yankees organization by sports magazine &quot;Baseball America&quot;; by contrast, Rivera&#x27;s highly touted cousin Rubén was ranked the second-best prospect in the entire sport. Mariano&#x27;s pitching repertoire primarily consisted of fastballs at the time, with a slider and changeup as secondary pitches. He began the 1995 season with Columbus, pitching to a 1–1 record and a 1.50 ERA in four starts.

===Major leagues (1995–2013)===

====1995–1997====

After being called up to the major leagues on May 16, 1995, Rivera made his debut for the New York Yankees on May 23 against the California Angels. Starting in place of injured pitcher Jimmy Key, Rivera allowed five earned runs in  innings pitched in a 10–0 loss. He struggled through his first four major league starts, posting a 10.20 ERA, and as a result, he was demoted to Columbus on June 11. As a 25-year-old rookie just three years removed from major arm surgery, Rivera did not have a guaranteed spot in the Yankee organization. Management considered trading him to the Detroit Tigers for starter David Wells. While recovering from a sore shoulder in the minor leagues, Rivera pitched a no-hit shutout in a rain-shortened five-inning start on June 26. Reports from the game indicated that his pitches had reached , about faster than his previous average velocity; Rivera attributes his inexplicable improvement to God. Yankees general manager Gene Michael was skeptical of the reports until verifying that Columbus&#x27; radar gun was not faulty and that another team&#x27;s scout had taken the same measurements. Afterwards, he ended any trade negotiations involving Rivera. On July 4, in his first start back in the major leagues, Rivera pitched eight scoreless innings against the Chicago White Sox, allowing just two hits while striking out 11 batters. In five subsequent starts, he was unable to match his success from that game. After a brief demotion to Columbus in August, Rivera made one last start in the major leagues in September before he was moved to the Yankees&#x27; bullpen. Overall, he finished his first major league season with a 5–3 record and a 5.51 ERA in ten starts and nine relief outings. His performance in the American League Division Series against the Seattle Mariners, in which he pitched  scoreless innings of relief, convinced Yankees management to keep him and convert him to a relief pitcher the following season.

Rivera was nearly traded prior to the 1996 season to address the Yankees&#x27; depleted depth at the shortstop position. Owner George Steinbrenner considered an offer to send Rivera to the Mariners in exchange for shortstop Félix Fermín, but Yankees management convinced Steinbrenner to instead entrust the position to rookie Derek Jeter. In 1996, Rivera served primarily as a setup pitcher, typically pitching in the seventh and eighth innings of games before closer John Wetteland pitched in the ninth. Their effectiveness as a tandem helped the Yankees win 70 of 73 games that season when leading after six innings. Over a stretch of games between April 19 and May 21, Rivera pitched 26 consecutive scoreless innings, including 15 consecutive hitless innings. During the streak, he recorded his first career save in a May 17 game against the Angels. Rivera finished the regular season with a 2.09 ERA in  innings pitched and set a Yankees single-season record for strikeouts by a reliever (130). Baseball Reference calculated his value to the Yankees that year to be 5.0 wins above replacement (WAR), a figure no reliever has surpassed in a single season since. In the postseason, he allowed just one earned run in  innings pitched, helping the Yankees advance to and win the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves. It was the franchise&#x27;s first World Series championship since 1978. In MLB&#x27;s annual awards voting by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA), Rivera finished in twelfth place for the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award and third for the AL Cy Young Award, which is given to the league&#x27;s best pitcher. Commentator and former player Tim McCarver said that the Yankees &quot;revolutionized baseball&quot; that year with Rivera, calling him &quot;a middle reliever who should have been on the All-Star team and who was a legitimate MVP candidate&quot;.
Yankees management decided not to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead to replace him with Rivera as the team&#x27;s closer. In April 1997, MLB retired the uniform number 42 league-wide to honor the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking the baseball color line, although Rivera was among 13 players allowed to keep the number per a grandfather clause. Rivera&#x27;s transition from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; he blew three of his first six save opportunities and indicated that he was initially uncomfortable in the role. With reassurance from manager Joe Torre, Rivera settled into the ninth-inning role, and he earned his first All-Star selection with 27 saves and a 1.96 ERA at the midseason break. In the 1997 All-Star Game, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an All-Star Game. That summer, he added a cut fastball to his pitching repertoire after accidentally discovering how to throw the pitch. Rivera finished the regular season with 43 saves in 52 opportunities and a 1.88 ERA. His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians; with the Yankees four outs from advancing to the next round of the postseason, Rivera allowed a game-tying home run to Sandy Alomar Jr. The Yankees eventually lost the game as well as the next one, eliminating them from the postseason.

====1998–2001====
Rivera spent two weeks on the disabled list with a groin strain during the opening month of the 1998 season, but following his return, he continued to establish himself as one of the major leagues&#x27; best closers. Moreover, he became the central figure of a Yankees bullpen that, supported by middle relievers Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton, contributed to the team&#x27;s late-1990s dynasty. That year, Rivera made the cutter one of his primary pitches, and it quickly became his signature, earning a reputation for breaking hitters&#x27; bats with its sharp lateral movement. He saved 36 games in 41 opportunities and had a 1.91 ERA in the regular season. In the 1998 postseason, he pitched  scoreless innings and saved six games, three of which came in the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. Rivera&#x27;s save in Game 4 of the series clinched the Yankees&#x27; championship, capping off a season in which they won an MLB-record 125 games combined in the regular season and the postseason. By season&#x27;s end, Rivera had allowed only two earned runs in 35 career postseason innings pitched—a 0.51 ERA—and by surpassing 30 innings pitched, he qualified for the major league record for lowest postseason career ERA; it is a record he still holds after 141 innings pitched.
In his salary arbitration case during the offseason, Rivera was awarded a $4.25 million salary, a raise from the $750,000 he was previously earning. In 1999, Rivera was selected for the All-Star team for a second time with 23 saves and a 2.29 ERA in the first half of the season. That summer, the Yankee Stadium scoreboard production staff began playing the song &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; by heavy metal band Metallica as Rivera&#x27;s entrance music. Staff members selected the song after witnessing in the previous year&#x27;s World Series how enthusiastically San Diego fans reacted to closer Trevor Hoffman entering games accompanied by AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Hells Bells&quot;. Although Rivera was indifferent to his entrance song and personally listened to Christian music, &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; soon became as much a part of his closer identity as his cutter. After recording three blown saves and a 7.84 ERA in July, he allowed just one earned run over his last 30 appearances. He ended the season with a 1.83 ERA and 45 saves in 49 opportunities, his first time leading the major leagues in saves. He received his first AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, which was given annually to the league&#x27;s best closer based on their statistics. In the 1999 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, Rivera recorded a win and two saves, the second of which clinched the Yankees&#x27; championship title, his third overall. For his performance against Atlanta, he received the World Series MVP Award. Rivera finished 1999 by pitching 43 consecutive scoreless innings in the regular season and postseason combined, and he placed third in voting for the AL Cy Young Award. After the season, he said that he intended to play four more seasons before retiring to become a minister, though he backed off those plans the following year.
In the offseason, Rivera was denied a $9.25 million salary in arbitration but was awarded $7.25 million per year instead, which was at the time the highest arbitration award in baseball history. In the 2000 season, Rivera was selected as an All-Star with 21 saves and a 2.95 ERA in the first half. On July 8, he saved both games of a day-night doubleheader against the New York Mets, one at Shea Stadium and the other at Yankee Stadium. He ended the season with 36 saves in 41 opportunities and a 2.85 ERA. In the postseason, Rivera saved six games, allowed three earned runs in  innings pitched, and broke two major league records: he eclipsed Dennis Eckersley&#x27;s record for most postseason saves with the 16th of his career; he also broke Whitey Ford&#x27;s record for most consecutive scoreless innings pitched in postseason play, a streak that ended shortly thereafter at  innings. In the 2000 World Series against the Mets, Rivera clinched a championship for the Yankees for the third consecutive year, his fourth championship overall. His save in the decisive Game 6 was the seventh World Series save of his career, setting a new record. By that point in his career, Rivera had established a reputation as an exceptional postseason performer—journalist Jack Curry called him the &quot;infallible weapon&quot; and &quot;the greatest reason the Yankees [were] three-time champions&quot;.
With Rivera&#x27;s contract set to expire after 2001, the Yankees signed him to a four-year, $39.99 million deal prior to the season, marking the first long-term contract of his career. In 2001, he was selected for the All-Star team for a third consecutive year. His final numbers included a 2.34 ERA, a closer career-high  innings pitched, and an MLB-leading 50 saves in 57 opportunities—his second time leading the league. His saves total that year broke the Yankees&#x27; single-season record (46) set by Dave Righetti in 1986, and it made him just the sixth MLB pitcher to reach 50 saves in a single season. For his performance, Rivera earned his second AL Rolaids Relief Man Award and finished eleventh in voting for the AL MVP Award. Despite having what sportswriters deemed an &quot;aura of invincibility&quot; in the postseason, Rivera failed to close out the decisive Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In one of his most infamous moments, he blew the save in the ninth inning, in part due to his own throwing error, and later lost the series for the Yankees by allowing a bloop single to Luis Gonzalez with the bases loaded to score the winning run. It was the first and only loss of Rivera&#x27;s postseason career, and it snapped his record streak of 23 consecutive postseason saves converted.

====2002–2005====
On May 9, 2002, Rivera recorded his 225th career save, surpassing Dave Righetti as the Yankees&#x27; franchise leader in saves. Over the next few months of the season, injuries limited his playing time. He was first placed on the disabled list in June due to a groin strain, though his first-half numbers, which included a 1.47 ERA and 21 saves, earned him an All-Star selection. In a game on July 14, Rivera endured one of his worst outings, allowing six earned runs, including a walk-off grand slam. One week later, he was placed on the disabled list with a shoulder strain. Rivera was activated on August 8 after receiving a cortisone shot but returned to the disabled list after a recurrence of shoulder tightness. For the season, Rivera recorded a 2.74 ERA and 28 saves in 32 opportunities in just 46 innings pitched.

To placate the Yankees&#x27; concerns about his durability, Rivera followed a strength and conditioning program in the offseason, instead of throwing. Torre said that he intended to reduce Rivera&#x27;s workload during the 2003 season to minimize injury risks, but Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to miss the first month. After returning on April 30, he pitched well in the season&#x27;s first half, saving 16 games in 17 opportunities. His save on June 13 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career win for starter Roger Clemens. Rivera slumped early in the second half; over one stretch, he blew five of eleven save opportunities, but he rebounded to convert his final 15 opportunities of the season. He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA (1.66), along with 40 saves in 46 opportunities. In the AL Championship Series against the arch-rival Boston Red Sox, Rivera had one of the most memorable postseason performances of his career; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5–5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone hit an eleventh-inning walk-off home run that clinched the Yankees&#x27; series victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series. Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher&#x27;s mound and collapsing in joy to thank God, as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate. Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves and a win in the series. The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16 innings pitched that postseason.

With a year remaining on his contract, Rivera signed a two-year extension in March 2004 worth $21 million, with an option for a third year. On May 28, he reached 300 career saves, making him the 18th player to do so. He was selected to his sixth All-Star team with a 0.99 ERA and an AL record-setting 32 saves at the midseason break. Rivera&#x27;s final numbers for the year included a 1.94 ERA and a career-high 53 saves in 57 opportunities; it was his third time leading the major leagues in saves. Along with winning a third AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, he placed third in the AL Cy Young Award voting. Following the Yankees&#x27; victory in the AL Division Series against the Minnesota Twins, Rivera returned home to Panama to mourn two relatives who had died in an accident in his swimming pool. Despite his status being in doubt for the AL Championship Series against the Red Sox, he returned to New York for Game 1 after attending the funeral in Panama earlier in the day. He recorded a save that night, as well as in Game 2. Although the Yankees led three-games-to-none in the series, Rivera blew saves in Games 4 and 5, and the Red Sox won both games in extra innings to avoid elimination. In Game 4, Boston&#x27;s Dave Roberts pinch ran and stole second base against Rivera, eventually scoring on a single to tie the game. In Game 5, Rivera entered with a one-run lead with runners on base and allowed a sacrifice fly to tie the score. Boston&#x27;s comeback victories helped them become the first (and, as of 2022, the only) team in MLB history to win a best-of-seven series in which they trailed three-games-to-none. Although he allowed just one earned run in the 2004 postseason, he blew three of five save opportunities in the two series.
Following a career high in appearances in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began on a low note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston dating back to the previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation with a sense of humor by tipping his cap to the crowd.

Rivera rebounded in dominating fashion. He pitched 23 consecutive scoreless innings, set a new career high by converting 31 consecutive save opportunities, and was selected to the All-Star team. Over the course of the season, he passed Rollie Fingers, Randy Myers, and Jeff Reardon on MLB&#x27;s all-time saves list, moving into fifth place. Rivera finished 2005 with 43 saves in 47 opportunities, and set new career bests in many statistical categories, including ERA (1.38) and walks plus hits per inning pitched, or WHIP (0.87). Rivera limited opposing hitters to a batting average against of .177, then the best mark of his closer career. In addition to winning a fourth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, he was voted by fans as the inaugural winner of the Delivery Man of the Year Award. In the BBWAA&#x27;s awards voting, Rivera placed second for the AL Cy Young Award behind starter Bartolo Colón, and ninth for the AL MVP Award—his best finishes for both awards. During the postseason, MLB announced the Latino Legends Team, an all-time roster of Latino players voted the greatest by fans; Rivera was named the team&#x27;s relief pitcher.
====2006–2008====

Rivera began 2006 with a 3.72 ERA and two losses in April, but his numbers improved in subsequent months. On June 6, he saved his 391st career game, passing Dennis Eckersley for the fourth-most saves in major league history. Rivera was selected to his third consecutive All-Star team with a 1.76 ERA and 19 saves entering the midseason break. He saved the AL&#x27;s comeback victory in the All-Star Game for his third career All-Star save, tying Eckersley&#x27;s record. On July 16, Rivera achieved another milestone by becoming the fourth MLB pitcher to reach 400 saves. In August, he guaranteed his $10.5 million contract option for 2007 by reaching 114 games finished over two years. Although a throwing elbow strain sidelined Rivera for most of September, he finished the 2006 season with 34 saves in 37 opportunities and an ERA of 1.80—his fourth consecutive season with a sub-2.00 ERA. For a second consecutive year, fans voted him the Delivery Man of the Year.
With his contract set to expire after the 2007 season, Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training. Team management declined to negotiate near the start of the season, prompting him to respond that he would consider free agency at the end of the year. In April, Rivera blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, and surrendered nine earned runs in  innings pitched. Concerned sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use, as the Yankees presented him with few situations to enter a game. Rivera saved 30 of his next 32 opportunities and posted a 2.26 ERA over the final five months of the season. On July 14, he passed John Franco for third place on the all-time saves list with his 425th career save. Still, Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs (25), hits (68), and ERA (3.15), and his 30 saves in 34 opportunities were his second-lowest total since 1997. After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round, Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent market. He initially indicated that his decision of where to sign would be influenced by whether long-time manager Joe Torre was re-signed. Although Torre did not return, Rivera remained with the Yankees by agreeing to a three-year, $45 million contract, making him the highest-paid reliever in baseball history.
Rivera rebounded in 2008 and began the year with 16 consecutive scoreless innings pitched and 28 consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06 ERA and 23 saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue&#x27;s final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL&#x27;s starting pitcher as a tribute to him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL&#x27;s extra-inning win. In the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September 15, he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular season saves; on September 21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue&#x27;s history, retiring Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out. After the Yankees missed the postseason for the first time in his career, Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed calcification of the acromioclavicular joint in his throwing shoulder, for which he underwent minor arthroscopic surgery in the offseason.

Rivera&#x27;s 2008 season was one of his best individual years. Along with a 1.40 ERA and 39 saves in 40 opportunities, he set career bests in multiple statistical categories, including WHIP (0.67), on-base plus slugging (OPS)-against (.422), batting average against (.165), save percentage (97.5%), walks (6), earned runs (11), and blown saves (1). He averaged 9.81 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched, his best mark as a closer. He pitched with such control that his 12.83 strikeout-to-walk ratio made him the second MLB pitcher ever to record a figure that high in a season (minimum 50 innings pitched). He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.

====2009–2012====

In his first 12 appearances of 2009, Rivera surrendered four home runs and had a 3.97 ERA, leading to speculation about his cutter&#x27;s effectiveness and his shoulder&#x27;s health at age 39. As the season progressed, his numbers improved, and on June 28 he became the second pitcher to reach 500 regular season saves. In the same game, while batting against fellow closer Francisco Rodríguez, he collected his first career run batted in by walking with the bases loaded. With 23 saves in 24 opportunities and a 2.43 ERA in the season&#x27;s first half, Rivera was named an All-Star for the tenth time. His save in the All-Star Game was his fourth career All-Star save, setting a new record. In the season&#x27;s second half, Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40 appearances, while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted with 36. He finished the regular season with a 1.76 ERA, 44 saves in 46 opportunities, and a 0.90 WHIP. In the postseason, he pitched 16 innings, allowing one earned run and saving five games, and he clinched the Yankees&#x27; victory in the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies—his fifth championship. He was the only closer who did not record a loss or blown save that postseason. Rivera collected several awards at season&#x27;s end, including his third Delivery Man of the Year Award, his fifth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, and the 2009 &quot;Sporting News&quot; Pro Athlete of the Year Award. Reflecting on the decade&#x27;s end, ESPN.com&#x27;s Jerry Crasnick called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 years.

In 2010, Rivera and two of his &quot;Core Four&quot; teammates, Derek Jeter and Jorge Posada, became the first trio in any of the four major sports leagues in North America (MLB, NFL, NBA, or NHL) to play together on the same team for 16 consecutive seasons. In May, Rivera blew a save to snap a personal streak of 51 consecutive save opportunities converted at home, tying him with Éric Gagné for the MLB record at the time. Rivera had one of his best first halves, compiling a 1.05 ERA, 20 saves in 22 opportunities, and 0.64 WHIP before the All-Star break, and in June, he set a personal best streak with 24 consecutive batters retired. He earned an 11th All-Star selection but withdrew from the game due to lingering oblique and knee injuries. In the second half, he was less effective—he struck out batters half as often, and in September, he compiled three blown saves and a 4.76 ERA. Rivera ended 2010 with a 1.80 ERA and 0.83 WHIP, numbers that were among his career bests, though his 33 saves in 38 opportunities and 6.75 strikeouts per 9 innings ratio were below his career averages. In the postseason, he pitched  scoreless innings while saving three games. After becoming a free agent in the offseason, he agreed to a two-year, $30 million contract to remain with the Yankees.
That same offseason, Trevor Hoffman retired as the all-time regular season saves leader with a final tally of 601, leaving Rivera as the active leader in saves and 42 behind Hoffman&#x27;s record to start 2011. Rivera&#x27;s season was marked by several milestones. He broke the all-time record for games finished, and in May, he became the 15th pitcher to make 1,000 appearances and the first to do so with a single team. He was named an All-Star for the 12th time with a 1.85 ERA and 22 saves in 26 opportunities at the midseason break, but for the second consecutive year, he skipped the game to rest injuries. His pursuit of the saves record reached a climax in the final month of the season. On September 13, he collected his 600th save, making him just the second pitcher to accomplish the feat. Four days later, he saved his 601st game, tying him with Hoffman for the most in MLB history. Rivera broke the record on September 19 at Yankee Stadium by closing out a 6–4 win against the Twins, the final out a strikeout of Chris Parmelee. After the game, Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli called him to offer his congratulations. Rivera finished the season with a 1.91 ERA, a 0.90 WHIP, and 44 saves in 49 opportunities, making him the first pitcher over the age of 40 to save at least 40 games in a season. In the offseason, he underwent throat surgery to remove polyps from his vocal cords.

Rivera began the 2012 season by blowing a save on Opening Day but followed it with eight scoreless innings and five saves for the remainder of April. After just nine appearances, his season was prematurely ended by a freak injury; prior to a May 3 game against the Kansas City Royals, Rivera was shagging balls during batting practice but his right knee buckled on the field&#x27;s warning track, causing him to tear his right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Speculation grew that the injury would end his career, as he had hinted at retirement during spring training. Rivera put those concerns to rest the following day when he announced his intentions to return, saying: &quot;Write it down in big letters. I&#x27;m not going down like this.&quot; He successfully underwent ACL reconstructive surgery on June 12, while his meniscus, previously thought to have been damaged, did not need to be repaired. Rafael Soriano filled in as closer in Rivera&#x27;s absence and saved 42 games in 46 opportunities. Rivera signed a one-year, $10 million contract in the offseason to remain with the team.

====2013====

After successfully rehabilitating his knee in the offseason, the 43-year-old Rivera announced on March 9, 2013, that he would retire after the 2013 season, his 19th in the major leagues. Throughout his final year, Rivera spent time during visits to each ballpark meeting privately with fans and unsung team employees to hear their stories and thank them for supporting baseball. He explained: &quot;It was important for me to meet the people who make baseball what it is, the people who work in the game every day. They have given me far more than I have given them.&quot; Each opposing team returned the favor by honoring Rivera with a gift during his final visit to their city. In Cleveland, the Indians teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to present Rivera with a gold record of his entrance song &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;. The Minnesota Twins commissioned a rocking chair made of broken bats, many broken personally by Rivera&#x27;s cutter, called the &quot;Chair of Broken Dreams&quot;. The rival Boston Red Sox gave him a painting and several artifacts from Fenway Park. Many teams made donations to the Mariano Rivera Foundation, the pitcher&#x27;s charitable organization. Corporate sponsors of the Yankees paid tribute as well. Delta Air Lines dedicated a Boeing 757 airplane with Rivera&#x27;s signature and uniform number 42 on the exterior, while Hard Rock Cafe retired &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; from its song system at all locations except for its Yankee Stadium restaurant.
Rivera&#x27;s 10 saves in 10 opportunities in April were his highest total for the opening month of a season. He converted his first 18 save attempts of the season until blowing a save against the Mets on May 28; it was the first time that he blew a save and lost a game without recording an out. Rivera entered the midseason break with 30 saves in 32 opportunities and a 1.83 ERA, and he was named an All-Star for the 13th time in his career, the second-most All-Star selections for a pitcher behind Warren Spahn&#x27;s 17. During the All-Star Game, held at Citi Field in New York, Rivera was called upon to pitch in the eighth inning for his final All-Star appearance. As he trotted onto the field, players from both teams remained near their dugouts and joined fans in giving Rivera a standing ovation as he stood alone on the field. Rivera retired all three batters he faced, preserving his 0.00 career ERA in All-Star Games. He was named the All-Star Game MVP, making him the first reliever selected to an All-Star team to ever receive the award, as well as the first pitcher since Pedro Martínez in 1999 and the second Yankee ever after Derek Jeter in 2000. He became the first MLB player to be named the MVP of a World Series, League Championship Series, and All-Star Game. Rivera&#x27;s performance dipped in the second half of the season, as he blew five save opportunities in the last two months, including three consecutive chances for the first time in his career. In a Fox Sports documentary chronicling his final year entitled &quot;Being: Mariano&quot;, Rivera said that the season-long process of bidding farewell to baseball had mentally and physically drained him and that by September, he had &quot;no desire&quot; left for the sport.

On September 22, 2013, a day that Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg declared &quot;Mariano Rivera Day&quot;, the Yankees held a 50-minute pre-game tribute to Rivera at Yankee Stadium. In a ceremony attended by former teammates, Yankees staff, and members of Jackie Robinson&#x27;s family, Rivera&#x27;s uniform number 42 was retired by the team, making him the first active Yankee to receive that honor. Metallica performed &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; live as he walked onto the field during the festivities. The team presented a video montage and several gifts to Rivera before he addressed the crowd to offer his thanks. Four days later against the Tampa Bay Rays, he pitched in the final game of his career before a home crowd at Yankee Stadium. Entering in the eighth inning to a pre-recorded introduction by late Yankees public address announcer Bob Sheppard, Rivera pitched  innings without allowing a baserunner. In the ninth inning, after retiring Yunel Escobar on a pop fly for the second out, Rivera was removed from the game; with permission from the umpires, Yankees manager Joe Girardi ceremonially delegated the substitution duty to Rivera&#x27;s long-time teammates Andy Pettitte and Derek Jeter. After they reached the mound to make the pitching change, the normally reserved Rivera tearfully embraced his teammates for nearly a minute. Walking off the field to a standing ovation from fans and players, he saluted the crowd and then took a curtain call. After the game, he visited the mound for a final time and grabbed a handful of dirt as a memento. Rivera finished his final season with a 2.11 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, and 44 saves in 51 opportunities, earning him the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award, among several awards. During the World Series, he was honored as the 13th recipient of the Commissioner&#x27;s Historic Achievement Award for his accomplished career and for being &quot;a great ambassador of the game&quot;.
==Player profile==
===Pitching style===

Rivera&#x27;s signature pitch was a cut fastball or &quot;cutter&quot;, which exhibited lateral movement towards left-handed hitters similar to that of a slider but with the velocity of a fastball. The sharp, late movement of Rivera&#x27;s cutter prevented hitters from making contact with the ball on the sweet spot of their bats, leading to them not only making weak contact on batted balls but also frequently breaking their bats. According to a tally by columnist Buster Olney, Rivera broke 44 bats during the 2001 regular season. Chipper Jones, who once witnessed teammate Ryan Klesko break three bats in a plate appearance against Rivera in the 1999 World Series, called the pitch a &quot;buzz saw&quot;. Rivera&#x27;s long fingers and loose wrist allowed him to impart more spin on the ball, contributing to the pitch&#x27;s movement. Describing his grip of the cutter, he said, &quot;it&#x27;s really a four-seam fastball with pressure on the middle finger&quot;. By adjusting the pressure that he applied to the ball with his fingertips, he could vary the pitch&#x27;s movement. One of the keys to his cutter grip was bending his thumb at the knuckle and tucking it under the ball so the nail aligned with his middle finger; this position prevented his thumb pad from impeding the spin of the ball as it left his hand. Rivera threw four-seam and two-seam fastballs as complementary pitches but primarily used his cutter; according to baseball statistics website Fangraphs, Rivera threw at least 82% cutters each season from 2008 to 2013. All three pitches typically reached a velocity in the low-to-mid 90s mph.
Early in his major league career, Rivera was a &quot;power pitcher&quot; who relied on an overpowering four-seam fastball that topped out at to retire hitters. By enticing them to swing and miss at pitches high in the strike zone, he accumulated strikeouts at a high rate. Rivera altered his pitching style after accidentally discovering the cutter. One day in June 1997 during one of his daily warm-up tosses with teammate Ramiro Mendoza, Rivera noticed that his fastballs were moving sharply and unpredictably, a problem that began to occur in games as well. After unsuccessfully spending a month trying to eliminate the movement, Rivera relented and incorporated the cutter into his pitching repertoire, making it one of his primary pitches in 1998. When asked about the pitch&#x27;s origin, he explained: &quot;It was just from God. I didn&#x27;t do anything. It was natural.&quot; As he came to rely on the cutter, Rivera began to record more outs on batted balls. This change resulted in his strikeouts per 9 innings rate decreasing from 10.87 in 1996 to 5.3 in 1998, but it also decreased his pitches per inning rate from 18.7 in 1995 to 14.9 in 1998. Rivera credited his improved efficiency and consequent longevity in baseball to his long-time pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre.

Rivera had an impeccable ability to accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, particularly on the inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters&#x27; anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said: &quot;He was so easy to catch because he always put the ball right there. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch.&quot; Rivera&#x27;s 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks 15th-best in MLB history. His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated pitching motion, one that Darrin Fletcher found deceptive as an opposing hitter. He said in 1999 that Rivera &quot;almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. It gives you a false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it&#x27;s exploding.&quot;
Defying conventional wisdom of lefty-righty matchups, switch hitters occasionally batted right-handed when facing the right-handed Rivera, believing that his cutter would jam a batter hitting left-handed. Similarly, some managers, such as Bruce Bochy in the 1998 World Series, sent right-handed batters to pinch hit for left-handers against Rivera, thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties to hit. Opposing hitters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup or batting practice bats, rather than risk breaking their best ones against his cutter.

Rivera was considered an exceptional athlete, distinguished by his slender physique and durability. His propensity to shag balls during batting practice convinced scouts he could be a top AL center fielder. Olney compared Rivera&#x27;s regimen of physical preparation and guidelines for staying healthy to Satchel Paige&#x27;s &quot;Rules for Staying Young&quot;. Former teammate Alex Rodriguez expressed amazement at Rivera&#x27;s athleticism and claimed that the pitcher completed a vertical jump in Yankees training camp at age 41.

===Personality===
Rivera exhibited a reserved demeanor on the field that contrasted with the emotional, demonstrative temperament of many of his peers. Hall of Fame closer Goose Gossage said that Rivera&#x27;s composure under stress gave him the appearance of having &quot;ice water in his veins&quot;. Commenting on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations, Rivera said, &quot;When you start thinking, a lot of things will happen... If you don&#x27;t control your emotions, your emotions will control your acts, and that&#x27;s not good.&quot; His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, &quot;He&#x27;s won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he&#x27;s no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run.&quot; Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances, saying, &quot;the game that you&#x27;re going to play tomorrow is not going to be the same game that you just played.&quot; Derek Jeter called him the &quot;most mentally tough&quot; teammate with whom he had ever played.

During his playing career, Rivera was regarded as a team leader within the Yankees organization, often mentoring younger pitchers and counseling teammates. He had a team-first mindset and deferred most discussions about individual accolades to team goals and his teammates, praising them for making his presence in games possible. When asked to describe his job, Rivera once put it simply, &quot;I get the ball, I throw the ball, and then I take a shower.&quot;

==Legacy==

Rivera was a dominant reliever throughout his career, pitching with a consistency and longevity uncharacteristic of a role commonly marked by volatility and high turnover. In his 17-year tenure as the Yankees&#x27; closer, Rivera compiled considerable career numbers. A 13-time All-Star, he is MLB&#x27;s all-time regular season leader in saves (652) and games finished (952). He pitched in 1,115 regular season games, which is fourth-most in MLB history, the most in AL history, and the most by a right-handed pitcher. Rivera holds or shares several records for the most seasons of reaching various save milestones, including seasons with at least: 20 saves (sixteen); 25 saves (fifteen consecutive, sixteen total); 30 saves (nine consecutive, fifteen total); 35 saves (twelve); 40 saves (nine); and 50 saves (two). At the time of his retirement, Rivera&#x27;s career ERA (2.21) and WHIP (1.00) were the lowest of any MLB pitcher in the live-ball era (minimum 1,000 innings pitched), making him one of the top pitchers since 1920 at preventing hitters from reaching base and scoring. He recorded an ERA under 2.00 in 11 seasons, tying him with Walter Johnson for the most such seasons (minimum 60 innings pitched each). Rivera also ranks first in career adjusted ERA+ (205), a statistic that adjusts ERA for league and ballpark to allow comparisons of pitchers on the same baseline. His 1,135 regular season strikeouts rank 13th all time among relievers.

In addition to his strong regular season numbers, Rivera excelled in the postseason, recording an 8–1 win–loss record and a 0.76 WHIP. He holds numerous postseason records, including lowest career ERA among players with a minimum of 30 innings pitched (0.70), most saves (42), most consecutive scoreless innings pitched (), most consecutive save opportunities converted (23), and most games pitched (96). He saved more than twice as many postseason games as any other pitcher; Kenley Jansen, with 20, has the next-highest total. In an oft-cited statistic, more people have walked on the Moon (12) than have scored an earned run against Rivera in the postseason (11). Joe Torre, who was the Yankees&#x27; manager for most of Rivera&#x27;s career, said: &quot;Let&#x27;s face it. The regular season for Mo is great, but that&#x27;s the cupcakes and the ice cream. What separates him from everybody else is what he&#x27;s done in the postseason.&quot; Rivera&#x27;s dominance in the postseason often led to him being utilized for two-inning appearances, as he saved a record 14 postseason games in this manner—more than all other relievers combined during his career. He ranks first all time in win probability added (WPA) in the postseason with 11.7, nearly three times the total of the next-closest player. He also ranks first all time in championship WPA in the postseason (183, or 1.83), meaning his performance alone added nearly two World Series championships to the Yankees. In a 2009 ESPN.com poll, Rivera was voted one of the top five postseason players in MLB history. Neil Greenberg of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ranked him the most &quot;clutch&quot; player in MLB postseason history.
Rivera achieved a reputation as an all-time great reliever among baseball experts and his peers. Hall of Fame starter-turned-closer Dennis Eckersley called him &quot;the best ever, no doubt&quot;, while Trevor Hoffman said he &quot;will go down as the best reliever in the game in history&quot;. Torre said, &quot;He&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever been around. Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure, but the calm he puts over the clubhouse.&quot; Writer Tom Verducci said, &quot;Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than any player at any position in the history of baseball. There is Rivera, a gulf, and then every other closer.&quot; He compared Rivera&#x27;s reputation for being the best at his sport&#x27;s position to those of Michael Jordan in basketball and Wayne Gretzky in ice hockey. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said, &quot;Clearly unequivocally, he&#x27;s the greatest relief pitcher of all time, and did it in a way that was remarkable.&quot; Speaking about Rivera&#x27;s looming presence at the end of games, Alex Rodriguez said: &quot;He&#x27;s the only guy in baseball who can change the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen. He would start affecting teams as early as the fifth inning, because they knew he was out there. I&#x27;ve never seen anyone who could affect a game like that.&quot; Gossage said that Rivera &quot;might be the greatest closer of all-time&quot; but suggested that the modern closer&#x27;s job has become too specialized and easy compared to multiple-inning &quot;firemen&quot; from Gossage&#x27;s era; Rivera had only one regular season save of seven-plus outs in his career, whereas Gossage logged 53. Rivera has been ranked among the greatest baseball players of all time, with &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranking him 91st in 2019, and ESPN.com ranking him 31st in 2022. Two years later, ESPN.com ranked him 59th on its list of the top 100 professional athletes of the 21st century.
Rivera is well respected throughout baseball for his professionalism. Fellow closer Joe Nathan said: &quot;I look up to how he&#x27;s handled himself on and off the field... You never see him show up anyone and he respects the game. I&#x27;ve always looked up to him and it&#x27;s always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him.&quot; Michael Young said of Rivera: &quot;I respect Mo more than anybody in the game. The guy goes out there, gets three outs and shakes [Jorge] Posada&#x27;s hand. You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves.&quot; In a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, &quot;Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers.&quot; Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; at the time of his retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson&#x27;s retired number. Speaking about Rivera&#x27;s connection to her husband, Robinson&#x27;s widow Rachel said: &quot;[Rivera] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I&#x27;ve always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it.&quot; Presenting him with the Commissioner&#x27;s Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: &quot;Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson&#x27;s sacred number 42.&quot;
Rivera&#x27;s cut fastball was a respected pitch among major league players. Jim Thome called it &quot;the single best pitch ever in the game&quot;. David Ortiz echoed his sentiment, saying: &quot;[Rivera&#x27;s] cutter was the single best pitch I&#x27;ve ever seen, but the really amazing thing is how he was able to do it for so many years. Are there guys now who have stuff as nasty as Mariano? Maybe for one year, two years. But nobody could maintain it like he did.&quot; In 2004, ESPN.com ranked his cutter as the best &quot;out pitch&quot; in baseball. Olney described his cut fastball as &quot;the most dominant pitch of a generation&quot;. Several of Rivera&#x27;s colleagues credit him with popularizing the cutter among major league pitchers. Fellow closer Jason Isringhausen, who adopted the pitch later in his career, said: &quot;I think he&#x27;s been an influence on everybody that throws it. Everybody saw what [Rivera] could do, basically with one pitch. Nobody could throw it like he did, but now, you talk about the evolution of the cutter—just ask hitters about it and they tell you everybody&#x27;s throwing one. And they hate it.&quot; Al Leiter, whose signature pitch was a cutter, echoed Isringhausen&#x27;s sentiments: &quot;Now, everybody throws it and Mo has had a huge influence on that. Pitchers watched him and marveled at what he did with one pitch.&quot; During the 2008 All-Star break, Roy Halladay consulted Rivera for help with his own cutter and traced the reliever&#x27;s suggested grip onto a baseball as a visual reference; Rivera&#x27;s willingness to help an opponent drew a playful fine from his teammates in the Yankees&#x27; kangaroo court.
==Personal life==

Rivera and his wife Clara have known each other since elementary school, and they were married on November 9, 1991. They have three sons: Mariano III, Jafet, and Jaziel. The family lived in Panama until 2000, when they relocated to Westchester County, New York. In 2006, the Riveras purchased a home in Rye, New York, for $5.7 million. They listed it for sale for $3.995 million in 2020, and sold it for $3.783 million in June 2022. The couple also sold a lakefront home in Tampa, Florida, for $3.2 million in December 2019.

Mariano III joined the Quinnipiac Bobcats baseball team as a walk-on, and after transferring, he also pitched for Iona College in New Rochelle, not far from his home. He was drafted by the Yankees with the 872nd pick in the 2014 MLB draft, but decided to return to Iona for his junior year. In the following year&#x27;s draft, Mariano III was selected by the Washington Nationals in the fourth round with the 134th overall pick. After pitching for the Potomac Nationals minor league team for four seasons, he opened an automobile repair shop in Chester, New York, in 2020.

Over the course of his professional career, Rivera learned English, beginning in 1991 with the Greensboro Hornets, when he realized none of his teammates spoke his native Spanish. He is now a proponent of Latino players learning English and of American press members learning Spanish to bridge the cultural gap. He encouraged immigrants to the United States to make learning English their top priority. Rivera became a naturalized citizen of the United States in October 2015 and was recognized as an Outstanding American by Choice during the ceremony.

In February 2019, a Panamanian woman accused Rivera of failing to financially support her two children, a boy and a girl then aged 11 and 15, that Rivera had allegedly fathered out of wedlock. Five lawsuits were filed in his native country, demanding child support that he allegedly stopped paying two years earlier. He called the demands &quot;unfounded&quot;, and the two sides ultimately settled the lawsuits.

===Religion and philanthropy===
Rivera is a devout Christian. During his childhood, neither he nor his family attended church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, &quot;I am glad we lost the World Series, because it means that I still have a friend.&quot; Rivera&#x27;s pitching glove was inscribed &quot;Phil. 4:13&quot;, in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 (&quot;I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me&quot;).
Rivera is involved with philanthropic efforts in several countries. The Mariano Rivera Foundation, a organization established in July 1998, helps provide underprivileged children with an education, distributing more than $500,000 annually in the US and Rivera&#x27;s native Panama through church-based institutions. His contributions in Panama include building an elementary school, providing Christmas gifts to children, and developing a program that provides computer access and adult mentors to youths. Rivera has funded church start-ups in Panama, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, California, Florida, and New York. In 2011, he acquired a 107-year-old church from the city of New Rochelle for $1, and after his foundation renovated it at a cost of $3 million, it opened in March 2014 as Refugio de Esperanza (&quot;Refuge of Hope&quot;). The church is part of the Assemblies of God organization and hosts a Pentecostal congregation that previously met at Rivera&#x27;s home, with his wife Clara serving as its pastor.

For years, the Mariano Rivera Foundation was a private institution, but during his final baseball season in 2013, many teams wanted to commemorate the pitcher by donating to his foundation. As a result, he formed a public version of it; Naomi Gandia was appointed its executive director, working from its headquarters in Stanton, Delaware. Since retiring from baseball, Rivera has dedicated himself to philanthropy and his churches. In 2014, he and Clara created a scholarship in their names that they have awarded to students at the local College of New Rochelle. Recently, Rivera has organized an annual charity golf tournament that benefits White Plains Hospital and his foundation. He also holds multiple events annually in Delaware, including giveaways of backpacks with school supplies to children, distribution of turkey dinners during the holiday season, and the &quot;Mariano Rivera Foundation 5K &amp; Kids Run&quot;. In 2021, his foundation launched the Mariano Rivera Mentorship Program, a faith-based initiative aimed at serving underprivileged males in Gainesville, Florida; New Rochelle; and Houston.

In 2012, the Giving Back Fund estimated that Rivera donated $627,500 to charity in 2010, ranking him as the 25th-most generous celebrity on a list that the fund compiled. He won the 2013 Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award, which is given to the MLB player &quot;who inspires others through his on-field performances and contributions to his community&quot;.

===Business interests and endorsements===

Rivera was an investor in two New York area restaurants: &quot;Clubhouse Grill&quot;, which opened in New Rochelle in 2006 as &quot;Mo&#x27;s New York Grill&quot;; and Siro&#x27;s, which opened in Manhattan in 2012. Both restaurants have since closed. In 2015, he opened a Toyota and Scion car dealership in Mount Kisco, New York, and in 2022, he opened a Honda dealership in Port Jefferson Station, New York. Rivera is a founder and part-owner of Cherri Cafe, a coffee company focused on Central American coffee, especially Panamanian beans.

Rivera has been a celebrity spokesman for several companies, including: Nike sports apparel; Canali, a premium men&#x27;s clothing company, as their first athlete spokesperson; the New York Acura Dealers; Skechers footwear; and The Hartford Financial Services Group. Rivera donated all his earnings from endorsement deals to his foundation. In June 2019, a partnership between Rivera and e-commerce website eBay was announced. According to eBay, the company created a collection of Rivera-centric sports memorabilia that included 42 game-used and personal items donated by him for auction to benefit his foundation. In 2024, he modeled for a streetwear collaboration between the New York Yankees and the clothing company New York or Nowhere.

A 2011 list by the marketing firm Nielsen ranked him as the second-most marketable player in baseball behind only Derek Jeter; the list accounted for personal attributes such as sincerity, approachability, experience, and influence. Based on sales figures from Majestic Athletic, Rivera had the 18th-best-selling MLB jersey in 2011, and the top-selling jersey in the second half of 2013. He earned approximately $169.6 million in salary during his baseball career, ten percent of which he donated to his foundation. After baseball, Rivera joined the Washington Speakers Bureau in July 2019 as a paid public speaker.

===Politics===

Rivera is a supporter of Israel as a Jewish state. In 2013, the New York Board of Rabbis (NYBR) named him their &quot;Man of the Year&quot;. The organization helped facilitate trips to Israel in 2015 and 2018 in which Rivera participated. The latter trip included a visit to Michve Alon, an Israel Defense Forces base, that was arranged by Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. Rivera attended the Christians United for Israel conference in July 2019.

Rivera served on the Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission formed by US president Donald Trump in March 2017. The following May, Rivera was nominated to co-chair the President&#x27;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. He was appointed to a second two-year term on the council in December 2020. He continued as a co-chair until 2022, when President Joe Biden appointed new co-chairs, but continued to serve as member of the council.

In August 2018, he co-hosted a fundraiser dinner for the America First Action PAC with Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle. In response to a &quot;Daily Beast&quot; article in July 2019 that labeled his politics &quot;far-right&quot;, Rivera defended himself and affirmed his support for President Trump, saying: &quot;I respect him, I respect what he does. I believe that he&#x27;s doing the best for the United States of America.&quot; Rivera said that their friendship predated Trump&#x27;s presidency and that he would not &quot;turn [his] back on [Trump]&quot;. Rivera continued to support Trump into 2024, endorsing him prior to that year&#x27;s presidential election.

===Lawsuit against Refuge of Hope church===
In January 2025, a civil lawsuit was filed in Westchester County against Rivera&#x27;s church Refuge of Hope, in which he and his wife Clara were accused of failing to protect an underage female member of their congregation from multiple incidents of sexual assault. According to the lawsuit, Clara convinced the girl&#x27;s mother to allow her daughter to participate in a 2018 summer internship at Ignite Life Center, a fellow Assemblies of God church in Florida affiliated with Refuge of Hope. There, the girl was allegedly assaulted by an older minor female on 15 occasions. After the victim&#x27;s mother became concerned for her daughter&#x27;s safety and contacted Clara, the Rivera couple allegedly traveled to Florida and urged the victim to remain quiet. The lawsuit also alleges that she was sexually assaulted by the same person later that summer in the Riveras&#x27; home in Rye while attending a barbecue, and by a male youth leader at Refuge of Hope in 2021. An attorney for the Riveras said the allegations against them were false and claimed the couple first heard about the sex abuse in 2022 after an attorney sent them a letter requesting a financial settlement.

==Post-baseball honors and recognition==

In March 2014, Rivera was twice recognized for his philanthropic efforts, receiving the ROBIE Humanitarian Award from the Jackie Robinson Foundation, as well as a Jefferson Award for Public Service. Later that month, the &quot;Legends Series&quot;, comprising two MLB exhibition games between the Yankees and Miami Marlins, was played in Rivera&#x27;s native Panama to &quot;honor [his] legacy&quot;. He helped promote the games, which were accompanied by charitable events and a gala benefiting his foundation. 

On April 9, 2014, MLB announced that a new annual award for relief pitchers, the Reliever of the Year Award, would replace the existing Delivery Man of the Year Award, and that the AL honor would be named after Rivera. The following month, a section of River Avenue bordering Yankee Stadium at 161st Street was renamed &quot;Rivera Avenue&quot; in the pitcher&#x27;s honor. This coincided with the release of his autobiography, &quot;The Closer: My Story&quot;, co-authored with Wayne Coffey. New York University bestowed an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree upon Rivera during its commencement ceremony at Yankee Stadium on May 21, 2014. During the 2015 Little League World Series, he was inducted into the Little League Hall of Excellence. The Yankees dedicated a plaque to Rivera in Yankee Stadium&#x27;s Monument Park on August 14, 2016.

Rivera was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame on January 22, 2019, in his first year of eligibility. He became the first player in history to be elected unanimously by the BBWAA, appearing on all 425 ballots; the previous record for election percentage was held by Ken Griffey Jr., who received 99.3% of votes in 2016. Rivera was the second Panamanian player to be elected to the Hall of Fame after Rod Carew, and the eighth relief pitcher. He was officially inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 21, 2019, in Cooperstown, New York. The ceremony was attended by 55,000 people, the second-largest crowd for a Hall of Fame induction. Among those in attendance were Panamanian president Laurentino Cortizo and Rivera&#x27;s former teammates, including Bernie Williams, who performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; on guitar. Rivera&#x27;s speech concluded the ceremony and lasted nearly 25 minutes, four of which he spoke in Spanish.
Leading up to and following his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Rivera was recognized by several institutions. The New York Racing Association hosted him at Saratoga Race Course as their guest of honor on July 12, 2019, and held a fundraising luncheon to benefit his foundation. At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, Gate 42B at Terminal 4 was renamed for Rivera in a ceremony with Delta Air Lines, which also placed a sticker bearing his signature and uniform number on one of their airplanes. On July 27, the City of New Rochelle held a parade in his honor and awarded him a key to the city. The Yankees held a pregame celebration for him at Yankee Stadium on August 17 and made a $250,000 donation to his foundation. On September 16, 2019, President Trump, a long-time Yankees fan, presented Rivera with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award that can be bestowed upon a person by the United States government. A statement on whitehouse.gov said: &quot;Off the field, through the Mariano Rivera Foundation, he has helped provide children in need with an education, empowering them to achieve a better future. The United States proudly honors Mariano Rivera for being a legend of the game of baseball and for his commitment to strengthening America&#x27;s communities.&quot;

<doc id="341818" wikidata="Q1804812" url="?curid=341818" title="Lane–Emden equation">
<text>In astrophysics, the Lane–Emden equation is a dimensionless form of Poisson&#x27;s equation for the gravitational potential of a Newtonian self-gravitating, spherically symmetric, polytropic fluid. It is named after astrophysicists Jonathan Homer Lane and Robert Emden. The equation reads
\right) + \theta^n = 0, &lt;/math&gt;|border colour=#0073CF|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where formula_1 is a dimensionless radius and formula_2 is related to the density, and thus the pressure, by formula_3 for central density formula_4. The index formula_5 is the polytropic index that appears in the polytropic equation of state,
formula_6
where formula_7 and formula_8 are the pressure and density, respectively, and formula_9 is a constant of proportionality. The standard boundary conditions are formula_10 and formula_11. Solutions thus describe the run of pressure and density with radius and are known as polytropes of index formula_5. If an isothermal fluid (polytropic index tends to infinity) is used instead of a polytropic fluid, one obtains the Emden–Chandrasekhar equation.

== Applications ==
Physically, hydrostatic equilibrium connects the gradient of the potential, the density, and the gradient of the pressure, whereas Poisson&#x27;s equation connects the potential with the density. Thus, if we have a further equation that dictates how the pressure and density vary with respect to one another, we can reach a solution. The particular choice of a polytropic gas as given above makes the mathematical statement of the problem particularly succinct and leads to the Lane–Emden equation. The equation is a useful approximation for self-gravitating spheres of plasma such as stars, but typically it is a rather limiting assumption.

== Derivation ==

=== From hydrostatic equilibrium ===
Consider a self-gravitating, spherically symmetric fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium. Mass is conserved and thus described by the continuity equation
formula_13
where formula_8 is a function of formula_15. The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is
formula_16
where formula_17 is also a function of formula_15. Differentiating again gives
formula_19
where the continuity equation has been used to replace the mass gradient. Multiplying both sides by formula_20 and collecting the derivatives of formula_7 on the left, one can write
formula_22

Dividing both sides by formula_20 yields, in some sense, a dimensional form of the desired equation. If, in addition, we substitute for the polytropic equation of state with formula_24 and formula_3, we have
formula_26

Gathering the constants and substituting formula_27, where
formula_28
we have the Lane–Emden equation,
formula_29

=== From Poisson&#x27;s equation ===

Equivalently, one can start with Poisson&#x27;s equation,
formula_30

One can replace the gradient of the potential using the hydrostatic equilibrium, via
formula_31
which again yields the dimensional form of the Lane–Emden equation.

==Exact solutions==
For a given value of the polytropic index formula_5, denote the solution to the Lane–Emden equation as formula_33. In general, the Lane–Emden equation must be solved numerically to find formula_34. There are exact, analytic solutions for certain values of formula_5, in particular: formula_36. For formula_5 between 0 and 5, the solutions are continuous and finite in extent, with the radius of the star given by formula_38, where formula_39.

For a given solution formula_34, the density profile is given by
formula_41

The total mass formula_42 of the model star can be found by integrating the density over radius, from 0 to formula_43.

The pressure can be found using the polytropic equation of state, formula_44, i.e.
formula_45

Finally, if the gas is ideal, the equation of state is formula_46, where formula_47 is the Boltzmann constant and formula_48 the mean molecular weight. The temperature profile is then given by
formula_49

In spherically symmetric cases, the Lane–Emden equation is integrable for only three values of the polytropic index formula_5.

=== For &quot;n&quot; = 0 ===
If formula_51, the equation becomes
formula_52

Re-arranging and integrating once gives
formula_53

Dividing both sides by formula_54 and integrating again gives
formula_55

The boundary conditions formula_10 and formula_11 imply that the constants of integration are formula_58 and formula_59. Therefore,
formula_60

=== For &quot;n&quot; = 1 ===
When formula_61, the equation can be expanded in the form
formula_62

One assumes a power series solution:
formula_63

This leads to a recursive relationship for the expansion coefficients:
formula_64

This relation can be solved leading to the general solution:
formula_65

The boundary condition for a physical polytrope demands that formula_66 as formula_67.
This requires that formula_68, thus leading to the solution:
formula_69

=== For &quot;n&quot; = 2 ===
This exact solution was found by accident when searching for zero values of the related TOV Equation.

We consider a series expansion around formula_70
formula_71
with initial values formula_72 and formula_73.
Plugging this into the Lane-Emden equation, we can show that all odd coefficients of the series vanish formula_74.
Furthermore, we obtain a recursive relationship between the even coefficients formula_75 of the series.
formula_76
It was proven that this series converges at least for formula_77 but numerical results showed good agreement for much larger values.

=== For &quot;n&quot; = 5 ===
We start from with the Lane–Emden equation:
formula_78

Rewriting for formula_79 produces:
formula_80

Differentiating with respect to leads to:
formula_81

Reduced, we come by:
formula_82

Therefore, the Lane–Emden equation has the solution
formula_83
when formula_84. This solution is finite in mass but infinite in radial extent, and therefore the complete polytrope does not represent a physical solution. Chandrasekhar believed for a long time that finding other solution for formula_85 &quot;is complicated and involves elliptic integrals&quot;.

====Srivastava&#x27;s solution====
In 1962, Sambhunath Srivastava found an explicit solution when formula_85. His solution is given by
formula_87
and from this solution, a family of solutions formula_88 can be obtained using homology transformation. Since this solution does not satisfy the conditions at the origin (in fact, it is oscillatory with amplitudes growing indefinitely as the origin is approached), this solution can be used in composite stellar models.

== Analytic solutions ==
In applications, the main role play analytic solutions that are expressible by the convergent power series expanded around some initial point. Typically the expansion point is formula_89, which is also a singular point (fixed singularity) of the equation, and there is provided some initial data formula_90 at the centre of the star. One can prove that the equation has the convergent power series/analytic solution around the origin of the form
formula_91
The radius of convergence of this series is limited due to existence of two singularities on the imaginary axis in the complex plane. These singularities are located symmetrically with respect to the origin. Their position change when we change equation parameters and the initial condition formula_90, and therefore, they are called movable singularities due to classification of the singularities of non-linear ordinary differential equations in the complex plane by Paul Painlevé. A similar structure of singularities appears in other non-linear equations that result from the reduction of the Laplace operator in spherical symmetry, e.g., Isothermal Sphere equation.

Analytic solutions can be extended along the real line by analytic continuation procedure resulting in the full profile of the star or molecular cloud cores. Two analytic solutions with the overlapping circles of convergence can also be matched on the overlap to the larger domain solution, which is a commonly used method of construction of profiles of required properties.

The series solution is also used in the numerical integration of the equation. It is used to shift the initial data for analytic solution slightly away from the origin since at the origin the numerical methods fail due to the singularity of the equation.

== Numerical solutions ==
In general, solutions are found by numerical integration. Many standard methods require that the problem is formulated as a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. For example,
:formula_93

Here, formula_94 is interpreted as the dimensionless mass, defined by formula_95. The relevant initial conditions are formula_96 and formula_97. The first equation represents hydrostatic equilibrium and the second represents mass conservation.

== Homologous variables ==

=== Homology-invariant equation ===
It is known that if formula_98 is a solution of the Lane–Emden equation, then so is formula_99. Solutions that are related in this way are called &quot;homologous&quot;; the process that transforms them is &quot;homology&quot;. If one chooses variables that are invariant to homology, then we can reduce the order of the Lane–Emden equation by one.

A variety of such variables exist. A suitable choice is
formula_100
and
formula_101

We can differentiate the logarithms of these variables with respect to formula_1, which gives
formula_103
and
formula_104
Finally, we can divide these two equations to eliminate the dependence on formula_1, which leaves
formula_106

This is now a single first-order equation.

=== Topology of the homology-invariant equation ===

The homology-invariant equation can be regarded as the autonomous pair of equations
formula_107
and
formula_108

The behaviour of solutions to these equations can be determined by linear stability analysis. The critical points of the equation (where formula_109) and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix are tabulated below.

<text>Spectrolite is an uncommon variety of labradorite feldspar.

== Colors ==
Spectrolite exhibits a richer range of colors than other labradorites as for instance in Canada or Madagascar (which show mostly tones of blue-grey-green) and high labradorescence. Due to the unique colors mined in Finland, spectrolite has become a brand name for material mined only there. Sometimes spectrolite is incorrectly used to describe labradorite whenever a richer display of colors is present, regardless of locality: for example, labradorite with the &quot;spectrolite&quot; play of colors has sometimes described material from Madagascar.

== History ==
Finnish geologist Aarne Laitakari (1890–1975) described the peculiar stone and sought its origin for years when his son Pekka discovered a deposit at Ylämaa in south-eastern Finland, while building the Salpa Line fortifications there in 1940. 

The quarrying of spectrolite began after the Second World War and became a significant local industry. In 1973, the first workshop in Ylämaa began cutting and polishing spectrolite for jewels. After that, a gem center was established in Ylämaa with training for gem-cutting accompanied by an annual Gem and Mineral Show initiated by Esko Hämäläinen, mayor of Ylämaa municipality.

<text>Peter Garland (born January 25, 1952, in Portland, Maine) is a composer, writer and publisher of Soundings Press.

A student of James Tenney and Harold Budd, much of Garland&#x27;s work could be considered post-minimal although many of his postminimal works such as &quot;The Days Run Away&quot; (1971) were written in the early 1970s at the same time as the first minimalist works. He is also an expert on Native American music, and on the music of Silvestre Revueltas. He is the author of &quot;Gone Walkabout: Essays 1991-&quot;. Garland started his Soundings Press series in 1971 after attending a publishing workshop with Dick Higgins at CalArts.

<text>Kyle Eugene Gann (born November 21, 1955, in Dallas, Texas) is an American composer, professor of music, critic, analyst, and musicologist who has worked primarily in the New York City area. As a music critic for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; (from 1986 to 2005) and other publications, he has supported progressive music, including such &quot;downtown&quot; movements as postminimalism and totalism.

==Biography==
Gann was born in 1955 and raised in a musical family. He began composing at the age of 13. After graduating in 1973 from Dallas&#x27;s Skyline High School, he attended Oberlin Conservatory of Music, where he obtained a B.Mus. in 1977, and Northwestern University, where he received his M.Mus. and D.Mus. in 1981 and 1983, respectively. As well as studying composition with Randolph Coleman at Oberlin, he also studied Renaissance counterpoint with Greg Proctor at the University of Texas at Austin. He studied composition primarily with Ben Johnston (1984–86) and Peter Gena (1977–81), and briefly with Morton Feldman (1975). In 1981–82 he worked for the New Music America festival.

Gann has also worked on Dennis Johnson&#x27;s once lost minimal composition &quot;November&quot;, which was written for solo piano in 1959 and later revised. The creation of &quot;November&quot; was inspired by Johnson&#x27;s UCLA college friend La Monte Young&#x27;s &quot;Trio for Strings&quot;, written in 1958. Johnson recorded part of it in 1962 on audio cassette. &quot;November&quot; was in turn an inspiration for Young&#x27;s 1964 &quot;The Well-Tuned Piano&quot;. Young gave, from his archive, a cassette copy of &quot;November&quot; to Gann, who made a new recording of it and produced six pages of the original score. Gann first performed a four-and-a-half-hour version in 2009 with Sarah Cahill, and has produced a new performance score based on the original material that R. Andrew Lee recorded in a five-hour version released in 2013 by Irritable Hedgehog Music, after receiving good reviews. In 2017 the Dutch pianist and composer Jeroen van Veen released &quot;November&quot; as part of his eight-disc &quot;Minimal Piano Collection&quot;, Vols. XXI–XXVIII.

Gann also worked as a journalist at the Chicago &quot;Reader&quot;, &quot;Tribune&quot;, &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, and &quot;New York Times&quot;. In 1986, he was hired as music critic at &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, where he wrote a weekly column until 1997, and then less frequently until 2005. Gann taught part-time at Bucknell University from 1989 to 1997. Since 1997, he has taught music theory, history, and composition at Bard College.

Gann is married to Nancy Cook and is the father of Bernard Gann, a guitarist formerly with the New York &quot;transcendental black metal&quot; band Liturgy.

== As composer ==
Gann&#x27;s work as a composer can be classified generally into three categories:
*microtonal works in just intonation, involving electronics;
*rhythmically complex works for Disklavier (computer-driven acoustic piano); and
*piano and ensemble music whose rhythmic complexity tends to be milder and within a single tempo framework.

Most of his music has expressed the concept of repeating loops, ostinati, or isorhythms of different lengths going out of phase with each other; the idea leads to simultaneous layers of different, mutually prime tempo relationships in his Disklavier and electronic works, and is used in a less obvious structural way in his live-ensemble music. This concept can be traced back to suggestions in the rhythmic chapter of Henry Cowell&#x27;s book &quot;New Musical Resources.&quot; Gann has also said that he found inspiration in his studies of astrology, into which he was drawn by the writings of composer/astrologer Dane Rudhyar.

Another thread in his work has been the influence, both rhythmic and melodic, of Native American music, particularly that of the Hopi, Zuni, and other Southwest Pueblo tribes. Gann first learned about this music from reading a musical analysis of a Zuni buffalo dance published in the book &quot;Sonic Design&quot; by Robert Cogan and Pozzi Escot. According to Gann, &quot;It was going back and forth between different tempos: triplet, quarter, dotted quarter, and quarters. So I started collecting American Indian music. [It] solved a rhythmic problem for me, because I was really interested in music with different tempos.&quot;

Starting in 1984 with his political piece &quot;The Black Hills Belong to the Sioux,&quot; Gann adopted a method of switching between different tempos (usually between quarter-notes, dotted eighths, triplet quarters, and other values) as a more performable alternative to the simultaneous layers at contrasting tempos that he had sought earlier under the influence of Charles Ives. Other composers had arrived at a similar technique via other routes, coalescing into a New York style of the 1980s and &#x27;90s called Totalism.

A common Gann strategy is to set a rhythmic process in motion and use harmony (mostly triadic or seventh-chord-based, whether microtonal or conventional) to inflect the form and focus the listener&#x27;s attention. Gann&#x27;s microtonal music proceeds according to Harry Partch&#x27;s technique of tonality flux, linking chords through tiny (less than a half-step) increments of voice-leading. In 2000, Gann studied jazz harmony with John Esposito.

<text>Hunter&#x27;s bend (or rigger&#x27;s bend) is a knot used to join two lines. It consists of interlocking overhand knots, and can jam under moderate strain. It is similar to the Zeppelin bend.

When assessed against other bends in stress tests using paracord, it was found to be &quot;not as strong as the blood knot, similar to the reverse figure of eight and stronger than the fisherman&#x27;s bend, sheet bend or reef knot&quot;.

==History==

In October 1978, an article in &quot;The Times&quot; presented it as a newly invented knot credited to Dr. Edward Hunter. He had used it for years to tie broken shoelaces before discovering its originality through a friend in the 1970s. When it appeared on the front page, it led to much publicity for the knot and also to the formation of the International Guild of Knot Tyers.

It was later pointed out by Amory Bloch Lovins that the knot had already been presented in &quot;Knots for Mountaineering&quot; by Phil D. Smith in the 1950s. The tying of the bend was described as a modification to the alpine butterfly bend. Smith had devised the knot in 1943 while working on the San Francisco waterfront and had called it simply a &quot;rigger&#x27;s bend&quot;.

Although not documented in the original 1944 print of &quot;The Ashley Book of Knots&quot;, it was later added in 1979 as entry #1425A.

<text>Charles Peter Wuorinen (, ; June 9, 1938 – March 11, 2020) was an American composer of contemporary classical music based in New York City. He also performed as a pianist and conductor. Wuorinen composed more than 270 works: orchestral music, chamber music, solo instrumental and vocal works, and operas, such as &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;. His work was termed serialist but he came to disparage that idea as meaningless. &quot;Time&#x27;s Encomium&quot;, his only purely electronic piece, received the Pulitzer Prize. Wuorinen taught at several institutions, including Columbia University, Rutgers University and the Manhattan School of Music.

== Life and career ==

=== Background ===
Wuorinen was born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. His father, John H. Wuorinen, the chair of the history department at Columbia University, was a noted scholar of Scandinavian affairs, who also worked for the Office of Strategic Services, and wrote five books on his native Finland. His mother, Alfhild Kalijarvi, received her M.A. in biology from Smith College. Wuorinen excelled academically, graduating from Trinity School (New York City) as valedictorian in 1956; he later received a B.A. (1961) and an M.A. (1963) in music from Columbia University. Early supporters included Jacques Barzun and Edgard Varèse.

=== 1940s and 1950s ===
Wuorinen began composing at age 5 and began piano lessons at 6. At 16 he was awarded the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s Young Composers&#x27; Award and the John Harms Chorus premiered his choral work &quot;O Filii et Filiae&quot; at Town Hall on May 2, 1954. He was active as a singer and pianist with the choruses at the Church of the Heavenly Rest and the Church of the Transfiguration (Little Church Around the Corner), and was the rehearsal pianist for the world premiere of Carlos Chávez&#x27;s opera &quot;Panfilo and Lauretta&quot; at Columbia University during the spring of 1957. From 1952 to 1956 Wuorinen was president of the Trinity School Glee Club. He was pianist, librarian, and general manager of the Columbia University Orchestra in 1956–57. During the summers of 1955 and 1956, he was the organist at Saint Paul&#x27;s Church in Gardner, Massachusetts, where his parents stayed during the summer months. He was awarded the Bearns Prize three times, the BMI Student Composers Award four times, and the Lili Boulanger Award twice (1961 and 1962). He was a fellow at the Chamber Music Conference and Composers&#x27; Forum of the East for several years. Many early professional performances of Wuorinen&#x27;s compositions took place on the &quot;Music of Our Time&quot; series at the 92nd Street Y run by violinist Max Pollikoff.

=== 1960s ===
In 1962 Wuorinen and fellow composer-performer Harvey Sollberger formed The Group for Contemporary Music. The ensemble raised the standard of new music performance in New York, championing such composers as Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and Stefan Wolpe, who wrote several works for the ensemble. Many of Wuorinen&#x27;s works were premiered by The Group, including &quot;Chamber Concerto for Cello&quot; and the &quot;Chamber Concerto for Flute&quot;. Major Wuorinen compositions of the &#x27;60s include &quot;Orchestral and Electronic Exchanges&quot;, premiered by the New York Philharmonic conducted by Lukas Foss; the First Piano Concerto, with composer as soloist; the &quot;String Trio&quot;, written for the then newly formed new music ensemble Speculum Musicae; and &quot;Time&#x27;s Encomium&quot;, Wuorinen&#x27;s only purely electronic piece, composed using the RCA Synthesizer at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center on a commission from Nonesuch Records, for which Wuorinen was awarded the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for Music at the age of 32. Wuorinen was appointed to instructor at Columbia in 1964 and promoted to assistant professor in 1969, the year he received an Ingram Merrill Foundation grant; during this period, he was visiting lecturer at the New England Conservatory (1968–71), Princeton University (1969–71), the University of Iowa (1970), and the University of South Florida (1971).

=== 1970s ===
The 1970s were a particularly fruitful period for Wuorinen, who taught at the Manhattan School of Music from 1971 to 1979. Chamber works during this decade include his first two string quartets, the &quot;Six Pieces for Violin and Piano&quot;, &quot;Fast Fantasy&quot; for cello and piano, and two large works for the Tashi Ensemble, &quot;Tashi&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot;. Works for orchestra include &quot;Grand Bamboula&quot; for strings, &quot;A Reliquary for Igor Stravinsky,&quot; which incorporates the elder master&#x27;s last sketches, the &quot;Second Piano Concerto,&quot; and the &quot;Concerto for Amplified Violin and Orchestra&quot;, which caused a scandal at its premiere at the Tanglewood Festival with Paul Zukofsky and the BSO conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. In 1976 Wuorinen completed his &quot;Percussion Symphony&quot;, a five-movement work for 24 players including two pianos for the New Jersey Percussion Ensemble and his longtime colleague Raymond Des Roches, as well as his opera subtitled &quot;a baroque burlesque&quot;, &quot;The W. of Babylon&quot; with an original libretto by Renaud Charles Bruce. The New Jersey Percussion Ensemble had also performed and recorded Wuorinen&#x27;s composition &quot;Ringing Changes&quot; in collaboration with the Group for Contemporary Music prior to the Percussion Symphony, setting the stage for this challenging larger-scale work. The ensemble, created by Raymond Des Roches, recorded the Percussion Symphony, which was released in 1978 by Nonesuch. In the late 1970s Wuorinen became interested in the work of the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot and with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation he conducted sonic experiments at Bell Labs in New Jersey. In an interview with Richard Burbank, Wuorinen is quoted as saying:

What I did at Bell Labs (with Mark Liberman) was to try various experiments in which strings of pseudo-random material, usually pitches but sometimes other things, were generated and then subjected to traditional types of compositional organization, including twelve-tone procedures. What I wanted to do was to see whether or not these things sounded &quot;composed,&quot; sounded purposively chosen. They did, at least by my lights. The random sequences were not just any old random sequences but were that of a kind called 1/f randomness.

=== 1980s ===
The 1980s were framed by two large-scale works for chorus and orchestra based on Biblical texts, the 60-minute oratorio &quot;The Celestial Sphere&quot; for the 100th Anniversary of the Handel Oratorio Society in Rock Island Illinois of 1980 and &quot;Genesis&quot; (1989), jointly commissioned by the Minnesota Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. Other major orchestral works during this period include the &quot;Rhapsody for Violin and Orchestra&quot;; the &quot;Third Piano Concerto,&quot; written for pianist Garrick Ohlsson; &quot;Movers and Shakers&quot;, the first work commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra for music director Christoph von Dohnányi; &quot;Bamboula Squared&quot; for computer-generated sound and orchestra (inspired by Wuorinen&#x27;s work at Bell Labs); and &quot;The Golden Dance&quot;. Wuorinen was composer in residence with the San Francisco Symphony from 1984 to 1989. Major chamber works of the 1980s include his &quot;Third String Quartet&quot; commissioned to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Hopkins Center for the Arts at Dartmouth College, &quot;The Blue Bamboula&quot; for pianist Ursula Oppens, the &quot;Sonata for Violin and Piano&quot; commissioned by the Library of Congress and premiered at the Library on an all-Wuorinen concert, &quot;String Sextet&quot;, &quot;New York Notes&quot;, &quot;Third Piano Sonata&quot; for Alan Feinberg, and trios for various combinations including three works for horn trio.
In the 1980s Wuorinen began an association with the New York City Ballet which resulted in a series of works designed for dance: &quot;Five (Concerto for Amplified Cello and Orchestra)&quot; for choreographer Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux and Wuorinen&#x27;s longtime colleague and champion Fred Sherry, &quot;Delight of the Muses&quot; based on works of Mozart and commissioned in honor of the Mozart&#x27;s bicentennial, and three works inspired by scenes from Dante&#x27;s &quot;La Divina Commedia&quot; for Peter Martins (&quot;The Mission of Virgil&quot;, &quot;The Great Procession&quot; and &quot;The River of Light&quot;). In addition to the Dante texts Wuorinen was influenced by the watercolors of William Blake. For the New York City Ballet Wuorinen also made a two-piano arrangement of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Variations for Orchestra (Schoenberg)&quot; choreographed by Richard Tanner, and Martins created a ballet based on Wuorinen&#x27;s &quot;A Reliquary for Igor Stravinsky.&quot; In 1985 Wuorinen was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.

=== 1990s ===
Wuorinen devoted increased attention to writing works for voice, including his setting of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; for soprano Phyllis Bryn-Julson and the &quot;Fenton Songs I &amp; II&quot; on poems by British poet James Fenton, with whom Wuorinen was collaborating on an opera. Major chamber works included the &quot;Saxophone Quartet&quot; for the Raschèr Saxophone Quartet, &quot;Percussion Quartet&quot;, &quot;Piano Quintet&quot;, and &quot;Sonata for Guitar and Piano&quot;. Orchestral works included the &quot;Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra&quot; and &quot;Symphony Seven&quot; as well as the Dante works for the New York City Ballet.

=== 2000 onward ===
With the start of the 21st century, James Levine became a major champion of Wuorinen&#x27;s music. Levine commissioned Wuorinen&#x27;s &quot;Fourth Piano Concerto&quot; for his first season at the Boston Symphony Orchestra; the tone poem &quot;Theologoumenon&quot; (a 60th birthday gift for Levine from his longtime manager Ronald Wilford), premiered by the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra; and the &quot;Eighth Symphony: Theologoumena&quot;, for the BSO. In honor of Wuorinen&#x27;s 70th birthday Levine conducted two performances of Wuorinen&#x27;s &quot;Ashberyana&quot; at the Guggenheim Museum.

Other champions of Wuorinen&#x27;s music include Peter Serkin, for whom Wuorinen composed three concertos including &quot;Time Regained&quot; (based on music of Machaut, Matteo da Perugia, Guillaume Dufay, and Orlando Gibbons) and &quot;Flying to Kahani&quot;, commissioned by Carnegie Hall; the solo &quot;Scherzo&quot; and &quot;Adagio&quot;; and the &quot;Second Piano Quintet&quot; with the Brentano Quartet, another ensemble with which Wuorinen has had a very fruitful relationship and for which he wrote his &quot;Fourth String Quartet&quot;. 
In 2004 the New York City Opera premiered his opera &quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot; based on the novel by Salman Rushdie, with a libretto by James Fenton. Two other song cycles based on Fenton&#x27;s poetry were created around this time, Fenton Songs I and II. Other works from this decade include &quot;Cyclops 2000&quot; for Oliver Knussen and the London Sinfonietta; &quot;Ashberyana&quot;, settings of poetry by John Ashbery; &quot;Spin5&quot;, a chamber concerto for violinist Jennifer Koh; the &quot;Fourth Piano Sonata&quot;, for Anne-Marie McDermott; &quot;Synaxis&quot;; &quot;Metagong&quot;; and &quot;It Happens Like This&quot;, a dramatic cantata on seven poems by James Tate premiered at Tanglewood with the composer conducting.

Between 2008 and 2012, Wuorinen composed the opera &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, based on Annie Proulx&#x27;s short story of the same name and with a libretto adapted by Proulx. It premiered on January 28, 2014, at the Real in Madrid to mixed reviews.

== Death ==
On September 7, 2019, Wuorinen suffered a fall that caused a subdural hematoma. Over the next several months he had three additional falls, ultimately leading to his death on March 11, 2020, at New York Columbia-Presbyterian hospital. A requiem mass was held at St. Ignatius of Antioch Episcopal Church on May 30, 2020. It was broadcast live and uploaded to YouTube.

== Music ==

Wuorinen wrote more than 270 pieces, including the operas &quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot; and &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;. He has been described as totally committed to twelve-tone composition, with Schoenberg, late Stravinsky, and Babbitt as primary influences. In later years, he called the term &quot;serialism&quot; &quot;almost without meaning&quot;.

Much of Wuorinen&#x27;s music is technically complex, requiring extreme virtuosity by the performer, including wide leaps, extreme dynamic contrasts, and rapid exchange of pitches. Fractals and the mathematical theories of Benoit Mandelbrot are also important aspects of his style, as can be seen in works such as &quot;Bamboula Squared&quot; and the &quot;Natural Fantasy&quot; for organ.

== Writings and lectures ==
Wuorinen wrote the book &quot;Simple Composition&quot;. He described it as

Wuorinen lectured at universities in the United States and abroad, and served on the faculties of Columbia, Princeton, and Yale Universities, the University of Iowa, the University of California-San Diego, the Manhattan School of Music, the New England Conservatory, the State University of New York at Buffalo, and Rutgers University. He wrote the introduction to Joan Peyser&#x27;s &quot;To Boulez and Beyond&quot;.

== Influence and legacy ==
Wuorinen&#x27;s works have influenced a number of other composers. Robert Black cited him as a particular influence on his style. Black also recorded Wuorinen&#x27;s &quot;New York Notes&quot;. Jazz trumpeter Dave Douglas wrote, &quot;Around 1992 I found Charles Wuorinen’s book &quot;Simple Composition&quot; in the Brooklyn Public Library. I thought, &#x27;At last! My problems are over!&#x27; Little did I know, they were just beginning... The book had a profound effect on me and spurred a whole new approach to composing for improvising small groups.&quot;

In 2019, Perspectives of New Music published a Festschrift, &quot;Charles Wuorinen: A Celebration at 80&quot;, comprising analytical articles and compositions written for the occasion by Wuorinen&#x27;s friends and colleagues. The issue (Volume 56, Number 2, Summer 2018) was followed by an 80th birthday celebration at the Eastman School of Music that featured a master class, a symposium, and concerts of his music as well as works dedicated to him.

== Criticism ==
Wuorinen was criticized as intolerant and hostile in his writings toward people with differing views on music. In 1963, he wrote in &quot;Perspectives on New Music&quot;, &quot;I must unequivocally state that pitch serialization is no longer an issue&quot;, and that young composers should be &quot;acting out the implications of the older generation&#x27;s work&quot;. For Richard Taruskin, such statements imply a totalitarian view that only twelve-tone composers are to be regarded as composers. Taruskin has described similar statements as &quot;fantasies of infantile omnipotence&quot;.

In 1971, the Columbia University music faculty denied Wuorinen tenure, which he attributed to &quot;hostility to the present, and those who advocate it in music&quot;. Others have attributed the decision to Wuorinen&#x27;s intolerant and arrogant attitude.

The opening paragraph of &quot;Simple Composition&quot; has been controversial. Taruskin describes it as another example of Wuorinen&#x27;s contempt for music outside the 12-tone system.

In a 1988 interview, Wuorinen said, &quot;I feel what I do is right [...] pluralism has gone too far&quot;, and criticized views on which &quot;the response of the untutored becomes the sole criterion for judgment&quot;. Rather, he suggested, &quot;I would try to change the present relationship of the composer to the public from one in which the composer says: &#x27;please, judge me,&#x27; to one in which I say: &#x27;I have something to show you and offer my leadership.&#x27;&quot;

More recently, Wuorinen called the term &quot;serialism&quot; &quot;almost without meaning&quot;, a statement that has also been criticized. In a 2005 interview, when asked if he was a serialist composer, he restated this opinion:

In 2018, Wuorinen denounced the Pulitzer Prize jury for awarding its music award to hiphop artist Kendrick Lamar, telling the &quot;New York Times&quot; the decision constituted &quot;the final disappearance of any societal interest in high culture.&quot;

== Performance and conducting ==
Wuorinen was active as a performer, a pianist and a conductor of his own works as well as other 20th-century repertoire. His orchestral appearances have included the Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony, New York Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the American Composers Orchestra. He conducted the American, and later the West Coast, premieres of Morton Feldman&#x27;s monodrama &quot;Neither&quot;.

In 1962 he co-founded The Group for Contemporary Music, an ensemble dedicated to performance of new chamber music. In addition to cultivating a new generation of performers, commissioning and premiering hundreds of new works, the Group has also been a model for similar organizations that have appeared in the United States since its founding.

== Personal life ==
Wuorinen resided in New York City and the Long Valley section of Washington Township, Morris County, New Jersey. He was married to his longtime partner and manager, Howard Stokar.

Wuorinen died in New York on March 11, 2020, aged 81, as a result of injuries sustained in a fall the preceding September.

<text>The Carrick bend, also known as the Sailor&#x27;s breastplate, is a knot used for joining two lines. It is particularly appropriate for very heavy rope or cable that is too large and stiff to be easily formed into other common bends. It will not jam even after carrying a significant load or being soaked with water.

As with many other members of the basket weave knot family, the carrick bend&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing interwoven and symmetrical shape has also made it popular for decorative purposes.

==Heraldry==
The Carrick bend is known as the &quot;Wake knot&quot; or &quot;Ormonde knot&quot; when it is used as a heraldic badge.

== Etymology ==

This knot&#x27;s name dates back to at least 1783, when it was included in a nautical bilingual dictionary authored by Daniel Lescallier. Its origins prior to that are not known with certainty. There are several possible explanations for the name &quot;Carrick&quot; being associated with this bend. The Elizabethan era plasterwork of Ormonde Castle in Carrick-on-Suir shows numerous carrick bends molded in relief. Or the name may come from Carrick Roads—a large natural anchorage by Falmouth in Cornwall, England. The name may also have been derived from the Carrack, a medieval type of ship.

== Variations ==
The eight crossings within the carrick bend allow for many similar-looking knots to be made. The lines in a &quot;full&quot; or &quot;true&quot; carrick bend alternate between over and under at &quot;every crossing&quot;. There are also two ways the ends can emerge from the knot: diagonally opposed or from the same side. The latter form is also called the &quot;double coin knot&quot;. The form with the ends emerging diagonally opposed is considered more secure.

Unfortunately, with so many permutations, the carrick bend is prone to being tied incorrectly.

==Appearance==
===Capsized===
The carrick bend is generally tied in a flat interwoven form as shown above. Without additional measures it will collapse into a different shape when tightened, a process known as capsizing, with the degree of capsizing depending on the looseness of the weave. This capsized form is both secure and stable once tightened, although it is bulkier than the seized form below. Incomplete capsizing resulting from a tight weave produces a form that is likewise secure and stable, but which is more difficult to untie, countering one of the advantages of the carrick bend. When the knot is allowed to capsize naturally under tension, considerable slippage of line through the knot can occur before tightening, so the knot should be set carefully before loading to avoid this slippage in use.

===Seized===

In the interest of making the carrick bend easier to untie, especially when tied in extremely large rope, the ends may be seized to prevent the knot from collapsing when load is applied. This practice also keeps the knot&#x27;s profile flatter and can ease its passage over capstans or winches.

The ends are traditionally seized to their standing part using a round seizing. For expediency, a series of double constrictor knots, drawn very tight, may also be used. When seizing the carrick bend, &quot;both&quot; ends must be secured to their standing parts or the bend will slip.

==Decorative uses==

In the decorative variation, both standing ends enter from one side and both working ends exit from the other. In this configuration the knot is known as the &quot;Josephine knot&quot; (macrame) or &quot;double coin knot&quot; (Chinese knotting). This form of the carrick bend is found depicted in heraldry, sometimes with the tails of heraldic serpents woven (or &quot;nowed&quot;) into this knot. In heraldry the knot is associated with Hereward the Wake and is known under the name Wake knot. It is depicted in the coat of arms of Bourne Town Council, Lincolnshire.

The knot can be tied using doubled lines for an even flatter, more elaborate appearance. A doubled carrick bend was used to ornamentally secure the lanyards on the breastplate of the US Navy Mark V diving helmet during inspection and between dives.

When the ends of the carrick bend are connected together, or more practically hidden behind the knot, it becomes a carrick mat. This same configuration is also one of the most basic Turk&#x27;s head knots.

==Security==

The fully interwoven diagonal carrick bend is the most secure variation. All other forms are inferior and not recommended as bends.

Although the carrick bend has a reputation for strength, some tests have shown it to be as weak as 65% efficiency.

<doc id="341854" wikidata="Q21272312" url="?curid=341854" title="Latin Church in the Middle East">
<text>The Latin Church of the Catholic Church has several dispersed populations of members in the Middle East, notably in Turkey, Cyprus and the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan). Latin Catholics employ the Latin liturgical rites, in contrast to Eastern Catholics who fall under their respective church&#x27;s patriarchs and employ distinct Eastern Catholic liturgies, while being in full communion with the worldwide Catholic Church. Latin Catholics in the Middle East are often of European descent, particularly from the medieval Crusader era and later the 20th-century colonial period.

Depending on the specific area in question, due to their cultural heritage descending from Catholics who lived under the Ottoman Empire, they are sometimes referred to as &quot;Levantines&quot;, , or &quot;Franco-Levantines&quot; (; ; ; ; or &quot;Tatlısu Frenkleri&quot;) after Frankokratia.

A distinctive era of influence occurred during the Crusades with the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem during the Middle Ages. As with the case of Eastern Catholics and other Christians in the Middle East, Latin Catholics have both a history and a present of persecution.

==History==

Levantines were mostly of Italian (especially Venetian and Genoese), French, or other Euro-Mediterranean origin. They have been living in the eastern Mediterranean coast of Lebanon and Syria since the middle Byzantine or the Ottoman era and in Constantinople (Istanbul), Smyrna (İzmir) and other parts of Anatolia (such as the port towns of Amasra, Sinop, Trabzon, Enez, Çanakkale, Foça, Çeşme, Bodrum, Alanya, Mersin, Iskenderun, etc., where the colonies of Genoese and Venetian merchants existed) in present-day Turkey.

The majority are either the descendants of traders from the maritime republics of Venice, Genoa, Pisa, Ancona and Ragusa who had colonies in the East Mediterranean coast; or the descendants of the French/Italian Levantines who lived in the Crusader states of the Levant (in present-day Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and Syria), especially in port towns such as Beirut, Tripoli, Tyre, Byblos, Acre, Jaffa, Latakia, etc.; or in major cities near the coast, such as Tarsus, Antioch, Jerusalem, etc. Others may be converts to Catholicism, immigrants from Anglo-French colonization, or Eastern Christians who had resided there for centuries.

==Levant==
When the United Kingdom took over the southern portion of Ottoman Syria in the aftermath of the First World War, some of the new rulers adapted the term &quot;Levantine&quot; pejoratively to refer to the inhabitants of mixed Arab and European descent in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, and to Europeans (usually French, Italian or Greek) who had assimilated and adopted local dress and customs.

Today, a small percentage of Lebanon&#x27;s small group of Latin Catholics are of at least partial French/Italian descent.

==Cyprus==

The Catholic community of Cyprus (&quot;Latinoi, Λατίνοι&quot;) consists one of the three recognized religious minorities of Cyprus, together with the Armenians and Maronites, according to the 1960 constitution.

== Turkey ==
Circa 2013 about 35,000 Levantines live in Turkey.

The name &quot;Italo-Levantine&quot; is specifically applied to people of Italian (especially Venetian or Genoese) origin, but even with some French or other Euro-Mediterranean roots, who have lived in Istanbul, İzmir and other parts of Anatolia in Turkey. Some of the Italian Levantines may have ancestral origins also in the eastern Mediterranean coast (the Levant, particularly in present-day Lebanon and Israel) dating back to the period of the Crusades and the Byzantine Empire. A small group came from Crimea and from the Genoese colonies in the Black Sea, after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.

The majority of the Levantines in modern Turkey are the descendants of traders/colonists from the Italian maritime republics of the Mediterranean (especially Genoa and Venice) and France, who obtained special rights and privileges called the Capitulations from the Ottoman sultans in the 16th century.

There are two large communities of Italian Levantines: one in Istanbul and the other in İzmir. At the end of the 19th century there were nearly 6,000 Levantines of Italian roots in İzmir. They came mainly from the nearby Genoese island of Chios in the Aegean Sea.

The community had more than 15,000 members during Atatürk&#x27;s presidency in the 1920s and 1930s, but today is reduced to only a few hundreds, according to Italian Levantine writer Giovanni Scognamillo.

They continue to live in Istanbul (mostly in the districts of Karaköy, Beyoğlu and Nişantaşı), and İzmir (mostly in the districts of Karşıyaka, Bornova and Buca.)

The largest Catholic church in Turkey is the Church of St. Anthony of Padua on İstiklal Avenue in the Beyoğlu (Pera) district of Istanbul, which was constructed between 1906 and 1912 by the Italian Levantine community.

They have been influential in creating and reviving a tradition of opera. Famous people of the present-day Levantine community in Turkey include Maria Rita Epik, Franco-Levantine Caroline Giraud Koç and Italo-Levantine Giovanni Scognamillo. Most of Turkey&#x27;s small Catholic community are Levantines.

===Notable people===
Notable people of the Italian Levantine community in Turkey include:
* Sir Alfred Biliotti, who joined the British foreign service and eventually rose to become one of its most distinguished consular officers in the late 19th century. Biliotti was also an accomplished archaeologist who conducted important excavations at sites in the Aegean and Anatolia.
* Livio Missir di Lusignano. Historian. His masterpiece is &quot;Les anciennes familles italiennes de Turquie&quot;.
* Giuseppe Donizetti,born in Bergamo, Italy, musician. He was Instructor General of the Imperial Ottoman Music at the court of Sultan Mahmud II.

<text>Jacob Emden, also known as Ya&#x27;avetz (June 4, 1697 – April 19, 1776), was a leading German rabbi and talmudist who championed traditional Judaism in the face of the growing influence of the Sabbatean movement. He was widely acclaimed for his extensive knowledge.

Emden was the son of the hakham Tzvi Ashkenazi and a descendant of Elijah Ba&#x27;al Shem of Chełm. He spent most of his life in Altona (now part of Hamburg, Germany). His son, Meshullam Solomon, served as rabbi of the Hambro Synagogue in London and claimed authority as Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom from 1765 to 1780.

The acronym Ya&#x27;avetz (, also rendered &quot;Yaavetz&quot;) stands for Yaakov ben Tzvi (יעקב בן צבי).

Seven of his 31 works were published posthumously.

== Biography ==

=== Early Life and Education ===
Jacob Emden (born Ashkenazi) was the fifth of his father&#x27;s 15 children. Until the age of seventeen, he studied Talmud under his father, Tzvi Ashkenazi, a foremost rabbinic authority, first in Altona and later in Amsterdam (1710–1714). In 1715, he married Rachel, daughter of Mordecai ben Naphtali Cohen, rabbi of Ungarisch-Brod (Uherský Brod) in Moravia (modern Czech Republic), and continued his studies in his father-in-law&#x27;s &quot;yeshivah&quot;. 

Emden mastered all branches of Talmudic literature and later expanded his studies to philosophy, kabbalah, and grammar—even attempting to learn Latin and Dutch despite his view that secular studies should be limited to periods when Torah study was not feasible.

===Career===
Emden initially spent three years in Ungarisch-Brod as a private Talmudic lecturer before taking up work as a dealer in jewelry and other goods—a trade that required extensive travel. Although he generally declined formal rabbinic positions, in 1728 he accepted the rabbinate of Emden, from which he later derived his name. He eventually returned to Altona, where he secured permission from the Jewish community to establish a private synagogue. Early on, he enjoyed cordial relations with Moses Hagiz, head of the Portuguese-Jewish community in Altona, though these later deteriorated due to calumnies. Similarly, his initially positive relations with the chief rabbi of the German community, Ezekiel Katzenellenbogen, later soured.

A few years later, Emden obtained permission from the King of Denmark to establish a printing press in Altona. He soon encountered controversy over his publication of the siddur &quot;Ammudei Shamayim&quot;, which contained harsh criticisms of influential local money changers. Despite receiving the approbation of the chief rabbi of the German communities, his opponents continued to denounce him.

=== Ya&#x27;avetz Pen Name ===
In the preface to his work &quot;She&#x27;I&#x27;Las Yaavetz&quot;, Emden recounts how, as a child, he questioned why his father signed only as Tzvi (צבי) rather than including his father&#x27;s name. His father explained that &quot;Tzvi&quot; stands for &quot;Tzvi ben Yaakov&quot; (צבי בן יעקב) and advised that when Emden began writing, he should sign as Ya&#x27;avetz (יעב&quot;ץ), with the letters representing Yaakov ben Tzvi. The name Ya&#x27;avetz appears in 1 Chronicles both as a place name and a personal name.

==Sabbatean controversy==
Emden accused Jonathan Eybeschütz of being a secret Sabbatean. The controversy lasted several years, continuing even after Eybeschütz&#x27;s death. Emden&#x27;s assertion of Eybeschütz&#x27;s heresy was chiefly based on the interpretation of some amulets prepared by Eybeschütz, in which Emden saw Sabbatean allusions. Hostilities began before Eybeschütz left Prague, and in 1751, when Eybeschütz was named chief rabbi of the three communities of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbek, the controversy reached the stage of intense and bitter antagonism. Emden maintained that he was at first prevented by threats from publishing anything against Eybeschütz. He solemnly declared in his synagogue the writer of the amulets to be a Sabbatean heretic and deserving of excommunication. In &quot;Megillat Sefer&quot;, he even accuses Eybeschütz of having an incestuous relationship with his own daughter, and of fathering a child with her. However, there have been allegations that &quot;Megillat Sefer&quot; was tampered with, and had deliberately ridiculous accusations, as well as outlandish tales, written in to the original in order to make a mockery of Emden.

Clashes between opposing supporters occurred in the streets drawing the attention of the secular authorities. The majority of the community, including Aryeh Leib Epstein of Königsberg, favored Eybeschütz; thus the council condemned Emden as a slanderer. People were ordered, under pain of excommunication, not to attend Emden&#x27;s synagogue, and he himself was forbidden to issue anything from his press. As Emden still continued his philippics against Eybeschütz, he was ordered by the council of the three communities to leave Altona. This he refused to do, relying on the strength of the king&#x27;s charter, and he was, as he maintained, relentlessly persecuted. His life seeming to be in actual danger, in May 1751 he left the town and took refuge in Amsterdam, where he had many friends and where he joined the household of his brother-in-law, Aryeh Leib ben Saul, rabbi of the Ashkenazic community.

The controversy was heard by both the Senate of Hamburg and by the Royal Court of Denmark. The Hamburg Senate quickly found in favour of Eybeschütz. King Frederick V of Denmark asked Eybeschütz to answer a number of questions about the amulets. Conflicting testimony was put forward and the matter remained officially unresolved although the court sentenced the council of the three communities to pay a fine of one hundred thaler for civil unrest and ordered that Emden be allowed to return to Altona.

Emden then returned to Altona and took possession of his synagogue and printing-establishment, though he was forbidden to continue his agitation against Eybeschütz. The latter&#x27;s partisans, however, did not desist from their warfare against Emden. They accused him before the authorities of continuing to publish denunciations against his opponent. One Friday evening (July 8, 1755) his house was broken into and his papers seized and turned over to the &quot;Ober-Präsident&quot; (royally imposed mayor), . Six months later von Qualen appointed a commission of three scholars, who, after a close examination, found nothing which could incriminate Emden. Eyebeschutz was re-elected as Chief Rabbi. In December of that year, the Hamburg Senate rejected both the King&#x27;s decision and the election result. The Senate of Hamburg started an intricate process to determine the powers of Eybeschütz, as Chief Rabbi.

The truth or falsity of his denunciations against Eybeschütz cannot be proved; Gershom Scholem wrote much on this subject, and his student Perlmutter devoted a book to proving it. According to historian David Sorkin, Eybeschütz was probably a Sabbatean, and Eybeschütz&#x27;s son openly declared himself to be a Sabbatean after his father&#x27;s death. There is further background which suggests that Eybeschutz may have been a Sabbatean. In July 1725, the Ashkenazic beit din of Amsterdam issued a ban of excommunication on the entire Sabbatean sect (kat ha-ma’aminim) based partially on the discovery of certain Sabbatean writings by it. Rabbi Ezekiel Katzenellenbogen, the chief rabbi of the Three Communities was unwilling to attack Eybeschütz publicly, but stated that one of the Sabbatean texts found by the Amsterdam beit din &quot;Va-Avo ha-Yom el ha-Ayyin” was authored by Eybeschütz and declared that the all copies of the work that were in circulation should be immediately burned. The recent discovery in Metz of notarial copies of the disputed amulets written by Eyebeschutz support Emden&#x27;s view that these are Sabbatean writings.

==Other notable events==

In 1756 the members of the Synod of Constantinov applied to Emden to aid in repressing the Sabbatean movement. As the Sabbateans referred much to the Zohar, Emden thought it wise to examine that book, and after a careful study he concluded that a great part of the Zohar was the production of an impostor.

Emden&#x27;s works show him to have been possessed of critical powers rarely found among his contemporaries. He was strictly Orthodox, never deviating the least from tradition, even when the difference in time and circumstance might have warranted a deviation from custom. Emden&#x27;s opinions were often viewed as extremely unconventional from the perspective of strictly traditional mainstream Judaism, though not so unusual in more free-thinking Enlightenment circles. Emden had friendly relations with Moses Mendelssohn, founder of the Haskalah movement, and with a number of Christian scholars.

In 1772 Frederick II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, having issued a decree forbidding burial on the day of death, the Jews in his territories approached Emden with the request that he demonstrate from the Talmud that a longer exposure of a corpse would be against the Law. Emden referred them to Mendelssohn, who had great influence with Christian authorities and wrote in excellent German. Mendelssohn wrote the requested letter to the Duke, but privately complained to Emden that based on the Talmud, it seemed the Duke was correct. Emden wrote to him in strong terms, saying that it was ludicrous to assert that the custom of the entire Jewish people was blatantly incorrect, and told Mendelssohn that this kind of claim would only strengthen rumors of irreligiousness he (Mendelssohn) had aroused by his associations.

==Views==
Emden was a traditionalist who responded to the ideals of tolerance being circulated during the 18th-century Enlightenment. He stretched the traditional inclusivist position into universal directions.
Like Maimonides, he believed that monotheistic faiths have an important roles to play in God&#x27;s plan for mankind, writing that &quot;we should consider Christians and Muslims as instruments for the fulfilment of the prophecy that the knowledge of God will one day spread throughout the earth.&quot; Emden praised the ethical teachings of Christianity, considering them beneficial in removing the prevalence of idolatry and bestowing gentiles with a &quot;moral doctrine&quot;. Emden also suggested that ascetic Christian practices provided additional rectification of the soul in the same way that Judaic commandments do.

He theoretically advocated the taking of a concubine by a scholar since the sages of the Talmud stated &quot;the greater the man, the greater his evil inclination&quot; and cited many sources in support. He also suggested it might be permissible under certain circumstances for a Jewish man to cohabit with a single Jewish woman, provided that she is in an exclusive relationship with him that is public knowledge and where she would not be embarrassed to ritually immerse. He also wished to revoke the ban on polygamy instituted by Rabbeinu Gershom believing it erroneously followed Christian morals, although he admitted he lacked the power to do so.

Emden wrote that he owned books containing secular wisdom written in Hebrew, but that he would read them in the bathroom. He was opposed to philosophy and maintained that the views contained in &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; could not have been authored by Maimonides, but rather by an unknown heretic.

=== Emden Siddur ===
20th-century printings of the Emden Siddur exist, notably the Lemberg edition (1904) and the Augsburg edition (1948), both bearing the cover title &quot;Siddur Beis Yaakov&quot; (also anglicized as &quot;Siddur Bet Yaakov&quot;; Hebrew: סידור בית יעקב). The covers identify the work as being by &quot;Jacob from Emden&quot; (יעקב מעמדין). The 472-page Lemberg 1904 printing includes &quot;Tikun Leil Shavuot&quot; on pages 275–305 and is considerably larger than Emden’s &quot;Shaarei Shamayim&quot; siddur.

==== Shaarei Shamayim ====
A physically smaller siddur, reprinted in Israel in 1994, was titled &quot;Siddur Rebbe Yaakov of Emden&quot; (Hebrew: סידור רבי יעקב מעמדין) on the upper half of the cover and &quot;Siddur HaYaavetz Shaarei ShaMaYim&quot; (סדור היעב&quot;ץ שערי שמים) elsewhere. Its commentary is less detailed than that of the full Emden Siddur—for example, it omits &quot;Tikkun Leil Shavuot&quot;. This edition is presented as a two-volume set.

<text>Tajik, Tajik Persian, Tajiki Persian, also called Tajiki, is the variety of Persian spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by Tajiks. It is closely related to neighbouring Dari of Afghanistan with which it forms a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of the Persian language. Several scholars consider Tajik as a dialectal variety of Persian rather than a language on its own. The popularity of this conception of Tajik as a variety of Persian was such that, during the period in which Tajik intellectuals were trying to establish Tajik as a language separate from Persian, prominent intellectual Sadriddin Ayni counterargued that Tajik was not a &quot;bastardised dialect&quot; of Persian. The issue of whether Tajik and Persian are to be considered two dialects of a single language or two discrete languages has political aspects to it.

By way of Early New Persian, Tajik, like Iranian Persian and Dari Persian, is a continuation of Middle Persian, the official administrative, religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire (224–651 CE), itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC).

Tajiki is one of the two official languages of Tajikistan, the other being Russian&lt;ref name=&quot;lenta.ru/news/2011/06/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as the official interethnic language. In Afghanistan, this language is less influenced by Turkic languages and is regarded as a form of Dari, which has co-official language status. The Tajiki Persian of Tajikistan has diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and even more from that of Iran due to political borders, geographical isolation, the standardisation process and the influence of Russian and neighbouring Turkic languages. The standard language is based on the northwestern dialects of Tajik (region of the old major city of Samarqand), which have been somewhat influenced by the neighbouring Uzbek language as a result of geographical proximity. Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persophone world, in part due to its relative isolation in the mountains of Central Asia.

==Name==
Up to and including the nineteenth century, speakers in Afghanistan and Central Asia had no separate name for the language and simply regarded themselves as speaking &quot;Farsi&quot;, which is the endonym for the Persian language. The term &quot;Tajik&quot; derives from Persian, although it has been adopted by the speakers themselves. For most of the 20th century, its name was rendered in the Russian spelling of &quot;Tadzhik&quot;.

In 1989, with the growth in Tajik nationalism, a law was enacted declaring Tajik the state (national) language, with Russian being the official language (as throughout the Union). In addition, the law officially equated Tajik with Persian, placing the word &quot;Farsi&quot; (the endonym for the Persian language) after Tajik. The law also called for a gradual reintroduction of the Perso-Arabic alphabet.

In 1999, the word &quot;Farsi&quot; was removed from the state language law.

==Geographical distribution==
Two major cities of Central Asia, Samarkand and Bukhara, are in present-day Uzbekistan, but are defined by a prominent native usage of Tajik language. Today, virtually all Tajik speakers in Bukhara are bilingual in Tajik and Uzbek. This Tajik–Uzbek bilingualism has had a strong influence on the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Bukharan Tajik. 

Tajiks are also found in large numbers in the Surxondaryo Region in the south and along Uzbekistan&#x27;s eastern border with Tajikistan. Tajiki is still spoken by the majority of the population in Samarkand and Bukhara today although, as Richard Foltz has noted, their spoken dialects diverge considerably from the standard literary language and most cannot read it.

Official statistics in Uzbekistan state that the Tajik community comprises 5% of the nation&#x27;s total population. However, these numbers do not include ethnic Tajiks who, for a variety of reasons, choose to identify themselves as Uzbeks in population census forms. 

During the Soviet &quot;Uzbekisation&quot; supervised by Sharof Rashidov, the head of the Uzbek Communist Party, Tajiks had to choose either to stay in Uzbekistan and get registered as Uzbek in their passports or leave the republic for the less-developed agricultural and mountainous Tajikistan. The &quot;Uzbekisation&quot; movement ended in 1924.

In Tajikistan Tajiks constitute 80% of the population and the language dominates in most parts of the country. Some Tajiks in Gorno-Badakhshan in southeastern Tajikistan, where the Pamir languages are the native languages of most residents, are bilingual. Tajiks are the dominant ethnic group in Northern Afghanistan as well and are also the majority group in scattered pockets elsewhere in the country, particularly urban areas such as Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kunduz, Ghazni, and Herat. Tajiks constitute between 25% and 35% of the total population of the country. In Afghanistan, the dialects spoken by ethnic Tajiks are written using the Persian alphabet and referred to as Dari, along with the dialects of other groups in Afghanistan such as the Hazaragi and Aimaq dialects. Approximately 48%-58% of Afghan citizens are native speakers of Dari. A large Tajik-speaking diaspora exists due to the instability that has plagued Central Asia in recent years, with significant numbers of Tajiks found in Russia, Kazakhstan, and beyond. This Tajik diaspora is also the result of the poor state of the economy of Tajikistan and each year approximately one million men leave Tajikistan to gain employment in Russia.

===Dialects===
Tajik dialects can be approximately split into the following groups:

# Northern dialects (Northern Tajikistan, Bukhara, Samarkand, Kyrgyzstan, and the Varzob valley region of Dushanbe).
# Central dialects (dialects of the upper Zarafshan Valley)
# Southern dialects (South and East of Dushanbe, Kulob, and the Rasht region of Tajikistan)
# Southeastern dialects (dialects of the Darvoz region and the Amu Darya near Rushon)
The dialect used by the Bukharan Jews of Central Asia is known as the Bukhori dialect and belongs to the northern dialect grouping. It is chiefly distinguished by the inclusion of Hebrew terms, principally religious vocabulary, and historical use of the Hebrew alphabet. Despite these differences, Bukhori is readily intelligible to other Tajik speakers, particularly speakers of northern dialects.

A very important moment in the development of the contemporary Tajik, especially of the spoken language, is the tendency in changing its dialectal orientation. The dialects of Northern Tajikistan were the foundation of the prevalent standard Tajik, while the Southern dialects did not enjoy either popularity or prestige. Now all politicians and public officials make their speeches in the Kulob dialect, which is also used in broadcasting.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
The table below lists the six vowel phonemes in standard, literary Tajik. Letters from the Tajik Cyrillic alphabet are given first, followed by IPA transcription. Local dialects frequently have more than the six seen below.
In northern and Uzbek dialects, classical has chain shifted forward in the mouth to . In central and southern dialects, classical has chain shifted upward and merged into . In the Zarafshon dialect, earlier has shifted to or , however from earlier remained (possibly due to influence from Yaghnobi).

The open back vowel has varyingly been described as mid-back , , and . It is analogous to standard Persian &quot;â&quot; (long &quot;a&quot;). However, it is standardly not a back vowel.

The vowel ⟨Ӣ ӣ⟩ usually represents a stressed /i/ at the end of a word. However, not all instances of ⟨Ӣ ӣ⟩ are stressed, as can be seen with the second person singular suffix -ӣ remaining unstressed.

The vowels /i/, /u/ and /a/ may be reduced to [ə] in unstressed syllables.

===Consonants===
The Tajik language contains 24 consonants, 16 of which form contrastive pairs by voicing: [б/п] [в/ф] [д/т] [з/с] [ж/ш] [ҷ/ч] [г/к] [ғ/х]. The table below lists the consonant phonemes in standard, literary Tajik. Letters from the Tajik Cyrillic alphabet are given first, followed by IPA transcription.

At least in the dialect of Bukhara, ⟨Ч ч⟩ and ⟨Ҷ ҷ⟩ are pronounced and respectively, with ⟨Ш ш⟩ and ⟨Ж ж⟩ also being and .

===Word stress===
Word stress generally falls on the first syllable in finite verb forms and on the last syllable in nouns and noun-like words. Examples of where stress does not fall on the last syllable are adverbs like: бале (&quot;bale&quot;, meaning &quot;yes&quot;) and зеро (&quot;zero&quot;, meaning &quot;because&quot;). Stress also does not fall on enclitics, nor on the marker of the direct object.

==Grammar==

The word order of Tajiki Persian is subject–object–verb. Tajik Persian grammar is similar to the classical Persian grammar (and the grammar of modern varieties such as Iranian Persian). The most notable difference between classical Persian grammar and Tajik Persian grammar is the construction of the present progressive tense in each language. In Tajik, the present progressive form consists of a present progressive participle, from the verb истодан, &quot;istodan&quot;, &#x27;to stand&#x27; and a cliticised form of the verb -acт, &quot;-ast&quot;, &#x27;to be&#x27;.

In Iranian Persian, the present progressive form consists of the verb دار, &quot;dār&quot;, &#x27;to have&#x27; followed by a conjugated verb in either the simple present tense, the habitual past tense or the habitual past perfect tense.

===Nouns===
Nouns are not marked for grammatical gender, although they are marked for number.

Two forms of number exist in Tajik, singular and plural. The plural is marked by either the suffix or (with contextual variants and ), although Arabic loan words may use Arabic forms. There is no definite article, but the indefinite article exists in the form of the number &quot;one&quot; and , the first positioned before the noun and the second joining the noun as a suffix. When a noun is used as a direct object, it is marked by the suffix , e.g., . This direct object suffix is added to the word after any plural suffixes. The form can be literary or formal. In older forms of the Persian language, could indicate both direct and indirect objects and some phrases used in modern Persian and Tajik have maintained this suffix on indirect objects, as seen in the following example: ). Modern Persian does not use the direct object marker as a suffix on the noun, but rather, as a stand-alone morpheme.

===Prepositions===
==Vocabulary==
Tajik is conservative in its vocabulary, retaining numerous terms that have long since fallen into disuse in Iran and Afghanistan, such as and . Most modern loan words in Tajik come from Russian as a result of the position of Tajikistan within the Soviet Union. The vast majority of these Russian loanwords which have entered the Tajik language through the fields of socioeconomics, technology and government, where most of the concepts and vocabulary of these fields have been borrowed from the Russian language. The introduction of Russian loanwords into the Tajik language was largely justified under the Soviet policy of modernisation and the necessary subordination of all languages to Russian for the achievement of a Communist state. Vocabulary also comes from the geographically close Uzbek language and, as is usual in Islamic countries, from Arabic. Since the late 1980s, an effort has been made to replace loanwords with native equivalents, using either old terms that had fallen out of use or coined terminology (including from Iranian Persian). Many of the coined terms for modern items such as and differ from their Afghan and Iranian equivalents, adding to the difficulty in intelligibility between Tajik and other forms of Persian.

In the table below, Persian refers to the standard language of Iran, which differs somewhat from the Dari Persian of Afghanistan. Two other Iranian languages, Pashto and Kurdish (Kurmanji), have also been included for comparative purposes.

==Writing system==

In Tajikistan and other countries of the former Soviet Union, Tajik Persian is currently written in the Cyrillic script, although it was written in the Latin script beginning in 1928 and the Arabic alphabet prior to 1928. In the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, the use of the Latin script was later replaced in 1939 by the Cyrillic script. The Tajik alphabet added six additional letters to the Cyrillic script inventory and these additional letters are distinguished in the Tajik orthography by the use of diacritics.

==History==
According to many scholars, the New Persian language (which subsequently evolved into the Persian forms spoken in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan) developed in Transoxiana and Khorasan, in what are today parts of Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. While the New Persian language was descended primarily from Middle Persian, it also incorporated substantial elements of other Iranian languages of ancient Central Asia, such as Sogdian.

Following the Islamic conquest of Iran and most of Central Asia in the 8th century AD, Arabic for a time became the court language and Persian and other Iranian languages were relegated to the private sphere. In the 9th century AD, following the rise of the Samanids, whose state was centered around the cities of Bukhoro (Buxoro), Samarqand and Herat and covered much of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and northeastern Iran, New Persian emerged as the court language and swiftly displaced Arabic. 

New Persian became the lingua franca of Central Asia for centuries, although it eventually lost ground to the Chaghatai language in much of its former domains as a growing number of Turkic tribes moved into the region from the east. Since the 16th century AD, Tajik has come under increasing pressure from neighbouring Turkic languages. Once spoken in areas of Turkmenistan, such as Merv, Tajik is today virtually non-existent in that country. Uzbek has also largely replaced Tajik in most areas of modern Uzbekistan – the Russian Empire in particular implemented Turkification among Tajiks in Ferghana and Samarqand, replacing the dominant language in those areas with Uzbek. Nevertheless, Tajik persisted in pockets, notably in Samarqand, Bukhoro and Surxondaryo Region, as well as in much of what is today Tajikistan.

The creation of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union in 1929 helped to safeguard the future of Tajik, as it became an official language of the republic alongside Russian. Still, substantial numbers of Tajik speakers remained outside the borders of the republic, mostly in the neighbouring Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, which created a source of tension between Tajiks and Uzbeks. Neither Samarqand nor Bukhoro was included in the nascent Tajik SSR, despite their immense historical importance in Tajik history. After the creation of the Tajik SSR, a large number of ethnic Tajiks from the Uzbek SSR migrated there, particularly to the region of the capital, Dushanbe, exercising a substantial influence in the republic&#x27;s political, cultural and economic life. The influence of this influx of ethnic Tajik immigrants from the Uzbek SSR is most prominently manifested in the fact that literary Tajik is based on their northwestern dialects of the language, rather than the central dialects that are spoken by the natives in the Dushanbe region and adjacent areas.

After the fall of the Soviet Union and Tajikistan&#x27;s independence in 1991, the government of Tajikistan has made substantial efforts to promote the use of Tajik in all spheres of public and private life. Tajik is gaining ground among the once-Russified upper classes and continues its role as the vernacular of the majority of the country&#x27;s population. There has been a rise in the number of Tajik publications. Increasing contact with media from Iran and Afghanistan, after decades of isolation under the Soviets, as well as governmental orientation toward a &quot;Persianisation&quot; of the language have brought closer Tajik and the other Persian dialects.

<doc id="341858" wikidata="Q34011" url="?curid=341858" title="Samoan language">
<text>Samoan ( or , ) is a Polynesian language spoken by Samoans of the Samoan Islands. Administratively, the islands are split between the sovereign country of Samoa and the United States territory of American Samoa. It is an official language, alongside English, in both jurisdictions. It is widely spoken across the Pacific region, heavily so in New Zealand and also in Australia and the United States. Among the Polynesian languages, Samoan is the most widely spoken by number of native speakers.

Samoan is spoken by approximately 260,000 people in the archipelago and with many Samoans living in diaspora in a number of countries, the total number of speakers worldwide was estimated at 510,000 in 2015. It is the third-most widely spoken language in New Zealand, where 2.2% of the population, 101,900 people, were able to speak it as of 2018.

The language is notable for the phonological differences between formal and informal speech as well as a ceremonial form used in Samoan oratory.

==Classification==
Samoan is an analytic, isolating language and a member of the Austronesian family, and more specifically the Samoic branch of the Polynesian subphylum. It is closely related to other Polynesian languages with many shared cognate words such as &quot;aliʻi&quot;, &quot;ʻava&quot;, &quot;atua&quot;, &quot;tapu&quot; and numerals as well as in the name of gods in mythology.

Linguists differ somewhat on the way they classify Samoan in relation to the other Polynesian languages. The &quot;traditional&quot; classification, based on shared innovations in grammar and vocabulary, places Samoan with Tokelauan, the Polynesian outlier languages and the languages of Eastern Polynesia, which include Rapanui, Māori, Tahitian and Hawaiian. Nuclear Polynesian and Tongic (the languages of Tonga and Niue) are the major subdivisions of Polynesian under this analysis. A revision by Marck reinterpreted the relationships among Samoan and the outlier languages. In 2008 an analysis, of basic vocabulary only, from the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database is contradictory in that while in part it suggests that Tongan and Samoan form a subgroup, the old subgroups Tongic and Nuclear Polynesian are still included in the classification search of the database itself.

==Geographic distribution==
There are approximately 470,000 Samoan speakers worldwide, 50 percent of whom live in the Samoan Islands.

Thereafter, the greatest concentration is in New Zealand, where there were 101,937 Samoan speakers at the 2018 census, or 2.2% of the country&#x27;s population. Samoan is the third-most spoken language in New Zealand after English and Māori.

According to the 2021 census in Australia conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Samoan language is spoken in the homes of 49,021 people.

US Census 2010 shows more than 180,000 Samoans reside in the United States, which is triple the number of people living in American Samoa, while slightly less than the estimated population of the island nation of Samoa – 193,000, as of July 2011.

Samoan Language Week (&quot;Vaiaso o le Gagana Sāmoa&quot;) is an annual celebration of the language in New Zealand supported by the government and various organisations including UNESCO. Samoan Language Week was started in Australia for the first time in 2010.

==Phonology==
The Samoan alphabet consists of 14 letters, with three more letters (H, K, R) used in loan words. The ( or &quot;ʻokina&quot;) is used for the glottal stop.

===Vowels===
Vowel length is phonemic in Samoan; all five vowels also have a long form denoted by the macron. For example, &quot;tama&quot; means child or boy, while &quot;tamā&quot; means father.

====Monophthongs==== 
Diphthongs are .

The combination of u followed by a vowel in some words creates the sound of the English w, a letter not part of the Samoan alphabet, as in &quot;uaua&quot; (artery, tendon).

 is reduced to in only a few words, such as &quot;mate&quot; or &quot;maliu&quot; &#x27;dead&#x27;, &quot;vave&quot; &#x27;be quick&#x27;.

===Consonants===
In formal Samoan, used for example in news broadcasts or sermons, the consonants are used. In colloquial Samoan, however, merge as and is pronounced .

The glottal stop is phonemic in Samoan. Its presence or absence affects the meaning of words otherwise spelled the same, e.g. = from, originate from; = sickness, illness. The glottal stop is represented by the (&quot;inverted comma&quot;), which is recognized by Samoan scholars and the wider community. The is often replaced by an apostrophe in modern publications. Use of the apostrophe and macron diacritics in Samoan words was readopted by the Ministry of Education in 2012 after having been abandoned in the 1960s.

 is pronounced as a flap following a back vowel () and preceding an ; otherwise it is . is less sibilant (hissing) than in English.
 are found in loan words.

The consonants in parentheses are only present in loanwords and informal Samoan.

====Foreign words====

Loanwords from English and other languages have been adapted to Samoan phonology:

* /k/ is retained in some instances (Christ = &quot;Keriso&quot;, club = &quot;kalapu&quot;, coffee = &quot;kofe&quot;), and has become [t] in rare instances (such as &quot;se totini&quot;, from the English &quot;stocking&quot;).
* /ɹ/ becomes [ɾ] in some instances (e.g. Christ = &quot;Keriso&quot;, January = &quot;Ianuari&quot;, number = &quot;numera&quot;), and [l] in others (January = &quot;Ianuali&quot;, herring = &quot;elegi&quot;).
* /d/ becomes [t] (David = &quot;Tavita&quot;, diamond = &quot;taimane&quot;).
* /ɡ/ becomes [k] in some cases (gas = &quot;kesi&quot;), while /tʃ/, /ʃ/ and /dʒ/ usually become [s] (Charles = &quot;Salesi&quot;, Charlotte = &quot;Salata&quot;, James = &quot;Semisi&quot;).
* /h/ is retained at the beginning of some proper names (Herod = &quot;Herota&quot;), but in some cases becomes an &#x27;s&#x27; (hammer = &quot;samala&quot;), and is omitted in others (herring = &quot;elegi&quot;, half-caste = &quot;afakasi&quot;)
* /z/ becomes [s] (Zachariah = &quot;Sakaria&quot;)
* /w/ becomes [v] (William = &quot;Viliamu&quot;)
* /b/ becomes [p] (Britain = &quot;Peretania&quot;, butter = &quot;pata&quot;)

===Stress===
Stress generally falls on the penultimate mora; that is, on the last syllable if that contains a long vowel or diphthong or on the second-last syllable otherwise.

Verbs formed from nouns ending in a, and meaning to abound in, have properly two aʻs, as (), , , but are written with one.

In speaking of a place at some distance, the accent is placed on the last syllable; as , he is at Safotu. The same thing is done in referring to a family; as Sa Muliaga, the family of Muliaga, the term referring to a wide extended family of clan with a common ancestor. So most words ending in , not a sign of a noun, as , , , and . So also all words ending in a diphthong, as , , .

In speaking the voice is raised, and the emphasis falls on the last word in each sentence.

When a word receives an addition by means of an affixed particle, the accent is shifted forward; as , love; , loving, or showing love; , beloved.

Reduplicated words have two accents; as , mud; , twilight. Compound words may have even three or four, according to the number of words and affixes of which the compound word is composed; as , to be engulfed.

The articles and are unaccented. When used to form a pronoun or participle, and are contractions for , , and so are accented; as , the owner, literally the (person) whose (is) the thing, instead of . The sign of the nominative , the prepositions , and the euphonic particles and , are unaccented; as , we two will go to you.

, the sign of the imperative, is accented on the ultima; , the sign of the subjunctive, on the penultima. The preposition is accented on the ultima, the pronoun on the penultima.

===Phonotactics===
Samoan syllable structure is (C)V, where V may be long or a diphthong. A sequence VV may occur only in derived forms and compound words; within roots, only the initial syllable may be of the form V. Metathesis of consonants is frequent, such as for &#x27;scent&#x27;, for &#x27;to call&#x27;, but vowels may not be mixed up in this way.

Every syllable ends in a vowel. No syllable consists of more than three sounds, one consonant and two vowels, the two vowels making a diphthong; as , , . Roots are sometimes monosyllabic, but mostly disyllabic or a word consisting of two syllables. Polysyllabic words are nearly all derived or compound words; as from (sit, seat) and , difficult of access; , from , to attend, and , fire, the hearth, making to attend to the fire; , (&quot;history&quot;) stories placed in order, , (&quot;communal house&quot;) house for receiving guests.

==Grammar==

===Morphology===

====Personal pronouns====
Like many Austronesian languages, Samoan has separate words for inclusive and exclusive we, and distinguishes singular, dual, and plural. The root for the inclusive pronoun may occur in the singular, in which case it indicates emotional involvement on the part of the speaker.

In formal speech, fuller forms of the roots , , and are , , and .

====Articles====
Articles in Samoan do not show the definiteness of the noun phrase as do those of English but rather specificity.

The singular specific article has frequently, erroneously, been referred to as a &quot;definite&quot; article, such as by Pratt, often with an additional vague explanation that it is sometimes used where English would require the indefinite article. As a specific, rather than a definite article, it is used for specific referents that the speaker has in mind (specificity), regardless of whether the listener is expected to know which specific referent(s) is/are intended (definiteness). A sentence such as , could thus, depending on context, be translated into English as &quot;A canoe appears&quot;, when the listener or reader is not expected to know which canoe, or &quot;The canoe appears&quot;, if the listener or reader is expected to know which canoe, such as when the canoe has previously been mentioned.

The plural specific is marked by a null article: &quot;the person&quot;, &quot;people&quot;. (The word in these examples is not an article but a &quot;presentative&quot; preposition. It marks noun phrases used as clauses, introducing clauses or used as appositions etc.)

The non-specific singular article is used when the speaker doesn&#x27;t have a particular individual of a class in mind, such as in the sentence , &quot;Cut me a stick&quot;, whereby there is no specific stick intended. The plural non-specific article is the plural form and may be translated into English as &quot;some&quot; or &quot;any&quot;, as in , &quot;Cut me some sticks&quot;.

In addition, Samoan possesses a series of diminutive articles.

====Nouns====
Names of natural objects, such as men, trees and animals, are mostly primitive nouns, e.g. , the sun; , the person; , the taro; , the fish; also manufactured articles, such as , an axe, , canoe, , spear, , house, etc.

Some nouns are derived from verbs by the addition of either , , , , or : such as , to chase; , chasing; , to fill the hand; , a handful; , to spit; , spittle; , to bury; , the part buried. These verbal nouns have an active participial meaning; e.g. , the building of the house. Often they refer to the persons acting, in which case they govern the next noun in the genitive with ; , contracted into , those who build the house, the builders. In some cases verbal nouns refer to either persons or things done by them: , the getting of taro, or the party getting the , or the itself which has been got. The context in such cases decides the meaning. Sometimes place is indicated by the termination; such as , to sleep; , a sleeping-place, a bed. is either the bathing-place or the party of bathers. The first would take after it to govern the next noun, , the bathing-place of the village; the latter would be followed by , , the bathing-place of the girls.

Sometimes such nouns have a passive meaning, such as being acted upon; , the thatch that has been pressed; , the heap of stones, that is, the stones which have been heaped up. Those nouns which take are rare, except on Tutuila; , the end; , the beginning; , lifetime; , quarrelling. Sometimes the addition of makes the signification intensive; such as and , rain; and , continued pouring (of rain).

The simple form of the verb is sometimes used as a noun: , to pray; , a prayer; , to be wise; , wisdom.

The reciprocal form of the verb is often used as a noun; e.g. , , quarrellings (from ), ; , mutual love is good.

A few diminutives are made by reduplication, e.g. , small crabs; , small shells; , ripples; &#x27;, small stones.

Adjectives are made into abstract nouns by adding an article or pronoun; e.g. , good; , goodness; , excellent or best; , that is his excellence or that is his best.

Many verbs may become participle-nouns by adding ; as , come, ; e.g. , his first coming; &quot;mau&quot; to mauga&quot;, , the first dwelling.

====Gender====
As there is no proper gender in Oceanic languages, different genders are sometimes expressed by distinct names:

When no distinct name exists, the gender of animals is known by adding and respectively. The gender of some few plants is distinguished by and , as in ; . No other names of objects have any mark of gender.

====Number====
The singular number is known by the article with the noun; e.g. , a boy.

Properly there is no dual. It is expressed by omitting the article and adding numbers for things e.g. , two girls, for persons; or , two houses; , two persons; or , them/those two (people).

The plural is known by:
# the omission of the article; , breadfruits.
# particles denoting multitude, as , , , and , and such plural is emphatic; , a shoal of fishes; , a forest of men, i.e., a great company; , a great number of things; , a crowd of people. These particles cannot be used indiscriminately; could not be used with fish, nor with men.
# lengthening, or more correctly doubling, a vowel in the word; , instead of , sisters of a brother. This method is rare.

Plurality is also expressed by internal reduplication in Samoan verbs &quot;(-CV- infix)&quot;, by which the root or stem of a word, or part of it, is repeated.



====Possessives====
Possessive relations are indicated by the particles or . Possessive pronouns also have a-forms and o-forms: , , , , and , etc. Writers in the 1800s like Platt were unable to understand the underlying principles governing the use of the two forms: &quot;There is no general rule which will apply to every case. The governing noun decides which should be used; thus , &quot;the wisdom of the builder&quot;; , &quot;the conduct of the boy&quot;; , &quot;words of &quot; (a form of narrated and sung storytelling); but , &quot;words of men&quot;. Pratt instead gives a rote list of uses and exceptions:

 is used with:
# Nouns denoting parts of the body; , eyes of the chief. So of hands, legs, hair, etc.; except the beard, which takes , ; but a chief&#x27;s is . Different terms and words apply to chiefs and people of rank and status according to the &#x27;polite&#x27; variant of the Samoan language, similar to the &#x27;polite&#x27; variant in the Japanese language.
# The mind and its affections; , the wrath of the chief. So of the will, desire, love, fear, etc.; , the desire of the land; , the fear of the boy.
# Houses, and all their parts; canoes, land, country, trees, plantations; thus, , posts of the house; , , etc.
# People, relations, slaves; , his people; , the chief&#x27;s wife. So also of a son, daughter, father, etc. Exceptions; , husband; , wife (of a common man), and children, which take ; , , , , .
# Garments, etc., if for use; . Except when spoken of as property, riches, things laid up in store.

 is used with:
# Words denoting conduct, custom, etc.; , , .
# Language, words, speeches; , , , ; .
# Property of every kind. Except garments, etc., for use.
# Those who serve, animals, men killed and carried off in war; .
# Food of every kind.
# Weapons and implements, as clubs, knives, swords, bows, cups, tattooing instruments, etc. Except spears, axes, and (the stick used for planting ), which take .
# Work; as . Except , which takes .

Some words take either or ; as , , , an answer given by Matautu; , an answer given to Matautu.

Exceptions:
# Nouns denoting the vessel and its contents do not take the particle between them: , a basket of taro; , a house of property, shop, or store-house.
# Nouns denoting the material of which a thing is made: , a coin of gold; , a canoe of teak.
# Nouns indicating members of the body are rather compounded with other nouns instead of being followed by a possessive particle: , an eye of bone; , a nose of a canoe; , a mouth of the sumu (type of fish); , a heart of love.
# Many other nouns are compounded in the same way: , the male wing; , the end of the post.
# The country or town of a person omits the particle: , a man or person of Samoa.
# Nouns ending in a, lengthen (or double) that letter before other nouns in the possessive form: ; , or , a branch road.
# The sign of the possessive is not used between a town and its proper name, but the topic marker is repeated; thus putting the two in apposition: , the commons of Matautu.

====Adjectives====
Some adjectives are primitive, as , long; , wise. Some are formed from nouns by the addition of , meaning &quot;covered with&quot; or &quot;infested with&quot;; thus, , dirt; , dirty; , mud; , muddy.

Others are formed by doubling the noun; as , a knot; , knotty; , a stone; , stony.

Others are formed by prefixing to the noun; as , Samoan custom or .

Like &quot;ly&quot; in English, the often expresses ; , behave like a pig (literally).

In one or two cases is prefixed; as , sticky, from , resin; , open; from and .

Verbs are also used as adjectives: , a difficult road; , a river, flowing water; , a live tree; also the passive: .

 is the prefix of condition, , to tear; , torn; as, , torn cloth; , to sink; , sunk; , a sunken canoe.

A kind of compound adjective is formed by the union of a noun with an adjective; as , a strong man, literally, the stronghanded man; , a weak-spirited man.

Nouns denoting the materials out of which things are made are used as adjectives: , a gold ring; , a stone house. Or they may be reckoned as nouns in the genitive.

Adjectives expressive of colours are mostly reduplicated words; as or (white); (black); (yellow); (brown); (red), etc.; but when they follow a noun they are usually found in their simple form; as , white cloth; , a black pig. The plural is sometimes distinguished by doubling the first syllable; as , white; plural, ; , great; pl. . In compound words the first syllable of the root is doubled; as , high; pl. . Occasionally the reciprocal form is used as a plural; as , flying; , flying creatures, birds.

Comparison is generally effected by using two adjectives, both in the positive state; thus , , this is good – but that is bad, not in itself, but in comparison with the other; , , this is long, that is short.

The superlative is formed by the addition of an adverb, such as , , , , ; as , it alone is good – that is, nothing equals it. , it is very exceedingly good; , it is very great. , highest, , differing from all others.

 has often the meaning of &quot;too much&quot;; , it is greater than is required.

===Syntax===
Sentences have different types of word order and the four most commonly used are:

# verb–subject–object (VSO)
# verb–object–subject (VOS)
# subject–verb–object (SVO)
# object–verb–subject (OVS)

For example:- &#x27;The girl went to the house.&#x27; (SVO); girl (subject), went (verb), house (object).

Samoan word order;



=== Negation ===
A phrase or clause can be made negative by the addition of a particle, a morpheme usually meaning &#x27;not&#x27;. There are two common negative particles in Samoan, and (sometimes also written as ). has the allomorphs [le:] or [le]. should not be confused for , the specific singular article, which indicates that the noun phrase refers to one particular entity. and negate declarative and interrogative sentences, but do not negate imperative sentences. Negative imperative verbs are discussed later in this entry. (meaning &quot;not&quot;) can be combined with all tense-aspect-mood particles (or &#x27;TAM&#x27; particles), except those that are optative and subjunctive, such as , , and .

A negative particle may mark a negative verbal clause, as seen in the example below.

In this example of a negated declarative sentence, it can be seen that, in Samoan, there is no equivalent gloss for &#x27;unhappy&#x27;. The negative particle modifies the verbal clause to form something like &quot;not happy&quot; instead.

The meaning of differs slightly from that of . indicates that an event or state has not been actualised yet, or for the time being, but is expected to become so. Therefore, is often translated as &quot;not yet&quot; rather than simply &quot;not&quot;. is usually only combined with the general TAM particle or . See the example below.

The above example (2) demonstrates the common usage of to mean &quot;not yet&quot;. In some cases, simply means &quot;no, not at all&quot;, expressing the concept that an event that had been expected to happen or had been thought to have happened, did not occur after all.

There is a particle, , that acts as a causative, as well being as the most common prefix in the Samoan language. This particle can be attached to nearly all nouns and non-ergative verbs. When attached to negated verb phrases, means having the qualities of or being similar to whatever is denoted by the basic stem or phrase. It is often combined with the negative particle (or its allomorphs) to form the construction . Prefixing onto a verb provides a polite way to say a negative phrase. Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen state that these particles provide three ways to express negative evaluations that vary on a scale of politeness, as demonstrated below:
==== Position of negation in sentences ====
In Samoan, particles modifying sentences usually take the first place in the sentence, with the exception of the question particle . The particles forming a category are not always mutually exclusive: for instance, while two negative particles cannot be combined, certain prepositions can occur together. Additionally, negative prenuclear particles will follow the preverbal pronoun or the TAM particle.

In the following examples from Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, the negative particles follow the TAM particle (Example 1: ) or the preverbal pronoun (Example 2: ).

In both examples, the negative particle is in the second position, after the preverbal pronoun and/or the TAM particle. In Example 2, there is both a preverbal pronoun () AND a TAM particle following it (). This demonstrates that the negative particle must always follow these two types of preceding particles in the sentence, even if they are both present.

==== Verbs exempt from negation ====
There are two existential verbs in Samoan: , &quot;to exist, be present&quot; and the negative equivalent [leái] or [le:ái], &quot;to not exist, be absent&quot;. They differ from all other Samoan verbs in at least one respect: they cannot be negated by a negative particle. Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen (1992, pp. 114) suggest that this originates in the etymology of these verbs: the negative existential verb is probably derived from (&quot;not&quot;) and (ANAPH, &quot;not there&quot;). It seems that the inclusion of negation in the verb itself disallows the negative particle from the sentence structure.

See the example from Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen (1992, pp. 56) in the sentence below:

In this example, the existential verb has been used to indicate the absence of something (that is, the cars) rather than using a negative particle. However, a negative particle () has been used in the second clause, modifying the verbal clause to create the phrase &quot;the roads did NOT reach there&quot;, with the emphasis on the absence of the roads in that area.

According to Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen (1992, pp. 480–481) the only TAM particles that appear with are and . This means that acts as if non-existence is a general fact, rather than linking it to a specific point in time. When another verb follows within the same verb phrase, it functions as a more emphatic negation meaning something like &quot;not at all&quot;. This is demonstrated in the following example:

Here, the addition of to the verb &quot;to move&quot; makes the statement more emphatic: not only did Sina not move, she did not move &quot;at all&quot;.

==== Negative imperative verbs ====
There are two negative imperative verbs, and . should not be confused with , which means &quot;because&quot;. These negative imperative verbs can be used independently of negative particles; as the negation is in the verb itself, an extra particle is not required. means &quot;don’t do, should not do&quot; and is employed to express commands in both direct and indirect speech. What should not be done is indicated by a verbal complement clause, as seen in the example below.

As discussed above, this sentence does not require a negative particle, because the negative imperative verb is sufficient. Alternatively, means that &#x27;one should stop doing something one has already started&#x27;. As with , what should not be done is indicated by a verbal complement. In direct speech, is either used in the imperative without any TAM particle or in the optative marked by .

See the example below with as the negative imperative:

This works differently from , although they are both imperative. It can be seen here that means something like &quot;cease what you are doing immediately&quot; while means &quot;don’t do that action&quot; (in a general sense).

==== Negation of existential clauses ====
The noun phrase forming an existential clause is introduced by a preposition: or , meaning &quot;only&quot;. An existential clause is negated with a complex clause: Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen state that &#x27;the existential clause functions as the argument of a verbal predicate formed by a TAM particle and the negative particle (&quot;not&quot;)&#x27;. An example of this can be seen in the example below, where the preposition precedes the negative particle .

This complex sentence has several examples of negation where the negative particle lē is combined with the preposition in order to negate an existential clause (&quot;there will be no...&quot;).

==Registers==

===Formal versus colloquial register===
The language has a polite or formal variant used in oratory and ceremony as well as in communication with elders, guests, people of rank and strangers.

The consonant system of colloquial Samoan (&quot;casual Samoan&quot;, or &quot;&quot; as it is known) is slightly different from the literary language (&quot;proper Samoan&quot;, or &quot;&quot;), and is referred to as K speech or K style. In colloquial speech, defined as taking place in casual social situations among intimates or in the home among familiars of equivalent social rank, /t/ is sometimes pronounced [k] and /n/ has merged with /ŋ/ as [ŋ]. Additionally, /l/ is pronounced following a back vowel (/a, o, u/) and preceding an /i/. /s/ is less sibilant than in English, and /h/ and /r/ are found only in borrowings, with /s/ and /l/ sometimes being substituted for them.

Therefore, in colloquial Samoan speech, common consonant replacements occur such as:

 is pronounced k – (child, boy) is pronounced &quot;kama&quot;; (&quot;to speak&quot;) is pronounced &quot;kaukala&quot;; (&quot;orator&quot;, &quot;talking chief&quot;) is pronounced &quot;kulāfale&quot;.

 is pronounced ng – (&quot;meeting&quot;, &quot;assembly&quot;) is pronounced &quot;fongo&quot;; (the numeral &quot;six&quot;) is pronounced &quot;ongo&quot;; &quot;&quot; (&quot;satisfied&quot;, &quot;full&quot;) is pronounced &quot;māonga&quot;.

===Oratorical register===
Historically and culturally, an important form of the Samoan language is oratory, a ceremonial language sometimes referred to in publications as &#x27;chiefly language&#x27;, or (&quot;dignified language&quot;) which incorporates classical Samoan terms and prose as well as a different set of vocabulary, which is tied to the roles of orator chiefs () and &#x27;speechmaking&#x27; () that remains part of the culture&#x27;s continuing indigenous system of governance and social organization. The (polite speech) register is used by lower-ranking people to address people of higher status, such as their family chief, government officials, or clergy. It is also the formal register used among chiefs during ceremonial occasions and social rites such as funerals, weddings, chiefly title bestowals and village council meetings.

It is not common for entire conversations to be held in chiefly register, and the &quot;dignified language&quot; is used mainly in making formal introductions between individuals, opening and concluding formal meetings, and executing ceremonial tasks (such as the ʻava ceremony). It is also considered proper to use the &quot;polite&quot; language when praying. Untitled people (those without chief titles) who are unfamiliar with each other will often greet each other in chiefly register as a common courtesy, while familiar individuals frequently use chiefly addresses in jest (as in humorously addressing friends with &quot;&quot; – &quot;respectful greetings your highness&quot; – instead of the more colloquial &quot;&quot; – &quot;hey man!&quot;).

Examples of &quot;polite&quot; word variants according to social rank:
Another polite form of speech in &quot;polite&quot; Samoan includes terms and phrases of self-abasement that are used by the speaker in order to show respect and flatter the listener. For example when praising the child of another woman, a mother might politely refer to her own children as &quot;&quot; (literally, &quot;piglets&quot;); in order to emphasize the beauty of a fine tapa cloth, the presenter might refer to it as a simple &quot; (plain cloth); the weaver of an especially fine mat might call it &quot; (coconut leaf) or &quot;&quot; (sail cloth) in order to not appear boastful. Overshadowing the dignity or prestige of higher-ranking individuals is a grave offense in Samoan culture, so words are chosen very carefully to express individual feelings in a way that acknowledges relative statuses within social hierarchy.

==Alphabet==
Encounters with Europeans began in the 1700s, followed by the era of colonialism in the Pacific. Samoan was only a spoken language until the early to mid-1800s when Christian missionaries began documenting the spoken language for religious texts and introducing the Latin script for writing. In 1834, an orthography of the language was distributed by the London Missionary Society, which also set up a printing press by 1839. The first complete Bible (&quot;Tusi Paʻia&quot;, Sacred Book) in Samoan was completed and published in 1862.

The first problem that faced the missionaries in Polynesia was that of learning the language of the island, which they intended to convert to Christianity. The second was that of identifying the sounds in the local languages with the symbols employed in their own languages to establish alphabets for recording the spelling of native words. Having established more-or-less satisfactory alphabets and spelling, teaching the indigenous people how to write and read their own language was next necessary. A printing press, with the alphabet keys used only English, was part of the mission equipment, and it was possible not only to translate and write out portions of the Bible scriptures, and hymns in the local language but also to print them for use as texts in teaching. Thus, the missionaries introduced writing for the first time within Polynesia, were the first printers and established the first schools in villages.
The alphabet proper consists of only 15 letters: 5 vowels, , and 10 consonants, . In addition, a macron () written over a vowel letters indicates the five long vowels, &#x27;, as in &#x27;animal&#x27;, &#x27;float, afloat&#x27;. The ʻokina &#x27; (, a reversed apostrophe) indicates the glottal stop, as in many other Polynesian languages. For typographic convenience, the ʻokina is often replaced by a simple apostrophe, &#x27;. The additional letters &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; are used in foreign loanwords, apart from the single interjection &#x27;gotcha!&#x27;; although the sound is found in native words in colloquial speech, it is spelled &#x27;. The letter &#x27; represents a velar nasal, as in the English word &quot;sing,&quot; rather than a voiced velar stop, as in the English &quot;go&quot;. Thus, the correct pronunciation of Pago Pago is .

The first grammar and dictionary of the Samoan language, &quot;A Grammar and Dictionary of the Samoan Language, with English and Samoan Vocabulary&quot;, was written by Reverend George Pratt in 1862. Pratt&#x27;s valuable Samoan dictionary records many old words of special interest, specialist terminology, archaic words and names in Samoan tradition. It contains sections on Samoan proverbs and poetry, and an extensive grammatical sketch.
Pratt was a missionary for the London Missionary Society and lived for 40 years in Matautu on the island of Savaiʻi.

==Vocabulary==

===Numbers===

The cardinal numerals are:

The term was an utmost limit until the adoption of loan words like (million) and (billion). Otherwise, quantities beyond were referred to as or ; that is, innumerable.

The prefix is also used to indicate the number of times.
For example; – three times. Or – how many times?

The prefix &quot; or &quot; indicates sequential numbering, as in &quot; (second), (third), &quot; (fourth); &quot; or &quot; denote &quot;first&quot;. Familial sequence was denoted with terms such as (&quot;eldest&quot;), (&quot;youngest&quot;), and (&quot;middle child&quot;); first and last born were also deemed honorifically, (&quot;opening the womb&quot;) and (&quot;sealing the womb&quot;), respectively.

To denote the number of persons, the term is used.
For example; . Seven people are going/travelling by bus.

The suffix &quot; is used when formally counting fish, in reference to the customary plaiting of fish in leaves (&quot;) before cooking.
For example: &quot;&quot; – three fishes

There are also formal prefixes or suffixes used in the chiefly register when counting different species of fish, taro, yams, bananas, chickens, pigs, and other foodstuffs.

=== Similarities to other Austronesian languages ===
Despite the geographical distance, there are many shared words between different Austronesian languages. Below is a list of examples from 4 other Malayo-Polynesian languages: Tongan, Hawaiian, Maanyan, Malay. Note the presence of IPA(key) where available.

=== Language preservation ===
Though it is not the primary language of a number of nations outside of Samoa, there is an effort by the descendants of Samoans to learn the native language of their ancestors and to better understand their origins and history. Much like any language, a shift is occurring in the way words are spoken and pronounced, especially as Samoans further integrate with other languages. Most looking to learn Samoan are forced to turn to written materials instead of living examples. To preserve the language, linguists must use diacritical marks. Without them, the actual pronunciations of words quickly become altered and lost. The marks are commonly found before, under and above letters in words and are especially helpful for students and non-native speakers to realize the difference the vowels and glottal stops can make in the pronunciation of words.

Examples include:

Below is another example of a sentence with and without diacritical marks from the Samoan Bible (O le tusi paia, o le Feagaiga Tuai ma le Feagaiga fou lea) [1]:

[Original] Faauta, ua e le foai mai ia te au ...

[With diacritics] Faʻauta ʻua ʻe lē fōaʻi mai iā te aʻu ...

Samoan diacritical marks may seem confusing at first due to the way the language shifts based on context. Also, the mixed use of diacritical marks in literature and even within the same publication can surprise non-native speakers. This is evident in the Bible translation created by early missionaries and Reverend George Pratt which features markings in some words and not others. Part of it was due to the need to save time on the writing and typesetting and to use the markings as a guideline. Much like the Bible helped improve literacy and understanding of the language throughout Samoan communities, written works continue to be important in much the same way today.

The use of the diacritical marks are not only prevalent in Samoan but also other Polynesian languages, such as Hawaiian, where similar pronunciation losses exist. Since native speakers understand how a word should be pronounced without the markings, words are commonly written and accepted with the markings absent. To prevent the loss of correct pronunciations, however, language preservation groups and the Samoan and Hawaiian governments, are taking measure to include diacritical markings in signage, television programs, school materials and printed media.

<text>Uyghur or Uighur (; , , or , , , CTA: Uyğurçä; formerly known as Turki or Eastern Turki) is a Turkic language written in a Uyghur Perso-Arabic script with 8–13 million speakers, spoken primarily by the Uyghur people in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Western China. Apart from Xinjiang, significant communities of Uyghur speakers are also located in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, and various other countries have Uyghur-speaking expatriate communities. Uyghur is an official language of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; it is widely used in both social and official spheres, as well as in print, television, and radio. Other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang also use Uyghur as a common language. 

Uyghur belongs to the Karluk branch of the Turkic language family, which includes languages such as Uzbek. Like many other Turkic languages, Uyghur displays vowel harmony and agglutination, lacks noun classes or grammatical gender, and is a left-branching language with subject–object–verb word order. More distinctly, Uyghur processes include vowel reduction and umlauting, especially in northern dialects. In addition to other Turkic languages, Uyghur has historically been strongly influenced by Arabic and Persian, and more recently by Russian and Mandarin Chinese.

The modified Arabic-derived writing system is the most common and the only standard in China, although other writing systems are used for auxiliary and historical purposes. Unlike most Arabic-derived scripts, the Uyghur Arabic alphabet has mandatory marking of all vowels due to modifications to the original Perso-Arabic script made in the 20th century. Two Latin alphabets and one Cyrillic alphabet are also used, though to a much lesser extent. The two Latin-based and the Arabic-based Uyghur alphabets have 32 characters each; the Uyghur Cyrillic alphabet also uses two iotated vowel letters (Ю and Я).

== History ==

The Middle Turkic languages are the direct ancestor of the Karluk languages, including Uyghur and the Uzbek language.

Modern Uyghur is not descended from Old Uyghur, rather, it is a descendant of the Karluk language spoken by the Kara-Khanid Khanate, as described by Mahmud al-Kashgari in the &quot;Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk&quot;. According to Gerard Clauson, Western Yugur is considered to be the true descendant of Old Uyghur and is also called &quot;Neo-Uyghur&quot;. According to Frederik Coene, Modern Uyghur and Western Yugur belong to entirely different branches of the Turkic language family, respectively the Southeastern Turkic languages and the Northeastern Turkic languages. The Western Yugur language, although in geographic proximity, is more closely related to the Siberian Turkic languages in Siberia. Robert Dankoff wrote that the Turkic language spoken in Kashgar and used in Kara Khanid works was Karluk, not (Old) Uyghur.

Robert Barkley Shaw wrote, &quot;In the Turkish of Káshghar and Yarkand (which some European linguists have called Uïghur, a name unknown to the inhabitants of those towns, who know their tongue simply as Túrki), ... This would seem in many case to be a misnomer as applied to the modern language of Kashghar&quot;. Sven Hedin wrote, &quot;In these cases it would be particularly inappropriate to normalize to the East Turkish literary language, because by so doing one would obliterate traces of national elements which have no immediate connection with the Kaschgar Turks, but on the contrary are possibly derived from the ancient Uigurs&quot;.

Probably around 1077, a scholar of the Turkic languages, Mahmud al-Kashgari from Kashgar in modern-day Xinjiang, published a Turkic language dictionary and description of the geographic distribution of many Turkic languages, &quot;Dīwān ul-Lughat al-Turk&quot; (English: &quot;Compendium of the Turkic Dialects&quot;; Uyghur: , &quot;Türki Tillar Diwani&quot;). The book, described by scholars as an &quot;extraordinary work,&quot; documents the rich literary tradition of Turkic languages; it contains folk tales (including descriptions of the functions of shamans) and didactic poetry (propounding &quot;moral standards and good behaviour&quot;), besides poems and poetry cycles on topics such as hunting and love and numerous other language materials. Other Kara-Khanid writers wrote works in the Turki Karluk Khaqani language. Yusuf Khass Hajib wrote the Kutadgu Bilig. Ahmad bin Mahmud Yukenaki (Ahmed bin Mahmud Yükneki) (Ahmet ibn Mahmut Yükneki) (Yazan Edib Ahmed b. Mahmud Yükneki) () wrote the (هبة الحقايق) () (Hibet ül-hakayık) (Hibbetü&#x27;l-Hakaik) (Atebetüʼl-hakayik) ().

Middle Turkic languages, through the influence of Perso-Arabic after the 13th century, developed into the Chagatai language, a literary language used all across Central Asia until the early 20th century. After Chaghatai fell into extinction, the standard versions of Uyghur and Uzbek were developed from dialects in the Chagatai-speaking region, showing abundant Chaghatai influence. Uyghur language today shows considerable Persian influence as a result from Chagatai, including numerous Persian loanwords.

Modern Uyghur religious literature includes the Taẕkirah, biographies of Islamic religious figures and saints. The Taẕkirah is a genre of literature written about Sufi Muslim saints in Altishahr. Written sometime in the period between 1700 and 1849, the Chagatai language (modern Uyghur) &quot;Taẕkirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams&quot; provides an account of the Muslim Karakhanid war against the Khotanese Buddhists, containing a story about Imams, from Mada&#x27;in city (possibly in modern-day Iraq) came 4 Imams who travelled to help the Islamic conquest of Khotan, Yarkand and Kashgar by Yusuf Qadir Khan, the Qarakhanid leader. The shrines of Sufi Saints are revered in Altishahr as one of Islam&#x27;s essential components and the tazkirah literature reinforced the sacredness of the shrines. Anyone who does not believe in the stories of the saints is guaranteed hellfire by the tazkirahs. It is written, &quot;And those who doubt Their Holinesses the Imams will leave this world without faith and on Judgement Day their faces will be black ...&quot; in the &quot;Tazkirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams&quot;. Shaw translated extracts from the Tazkiratu&#x27;l-Bughra on the Muslim Turki war against the &quot;infidel&quot; Khotan. The Turki-language &quot;Tadhkirah i Khwajagan&quot; was written by M. Sadiq Kashghari. Historical works like the &quot;Tārīkh-i amniyya&quot; and &quot;Tārīkh-i ḥamīdi&quot; were written by Musa Sayrami.

The Qing dynasty commissioned dictionaries on the major languages of China which included Chagatai Turki language, such as the Pentaglot Dictionary.

The historical term &quot;Uyghur&quot; was appropriated for the language that had been known as Eastern Turki by government officials in the Soviet Union in 1922 and in Xinjiang in 1934. Sergey Malov was behind the idea of renaming Turki to Uyghurs. The use of the term Uyghur has led to anachronisms when describing the history of the people. In one of his books the term Uyghur was deliberately not used by James A. Millward. The name Khāqāniyya was given to the Qarluks who inhabited Kāshghar and Bālāsāghūn, the inhabitants were not Uighur, but their language has been retroactively labelled as Uighur by scholars. The Qarakhanids called their own language the &quot;Turk&quot; or &quot;Kashgar&quot; language and did not use Uighur to describe their own language, Uighur was used to describe the language of non-Muslims but Chinese scholars have anachronistically called a Qarakhanid work written by Kashgari as &quot;Uighur&quot;. The name &quot;Altishahri-Jungharian Uyghur&quot; was used by the Soviet educated Uyghur Qadir Haji in 1927.

== Classification ==

The Uyghur language belongs to the Karluk Turkic (&quot;Qarluq&quot;) branch of the Turkic language family. It is closely related to Äynu, Lop, Ili Turki, the extinct language Chagatay (the East Karluk languages), and more distantly to Uzbek (which is West Karluk).

== Dialects ==
It is widely accepted that Uyghur has three main dialects, all based on their geographical distribution. Each of these main dialects have a number of sub-dialects which all are mutually intelligible to some extent.

* Central: Spoken in an area stretching from Kumul southward to Yarkand
* Southern: Spoken in an area stretching from Guma eastward to Qarkilik
* Eastern: Spoken in an area stretching from Qarkilik northward to . The Lop dialect (also known as Lopluk) that falls under the Eastern dialect of the Uighur language is classified as a critically endangered language. It is spoken by less than 0.5% of the overall Uighur speakers population but has tremendous values in comparative research. 

The Central dialects are spoken by 90% of the Uyghur-speaking population, while the two other branches of dialects only are spoken by a relatively small minority.

Vowel reduction is common in the northern parts of where Uyghur is spoken, but not in the south.

== Status ==
Uyghur is spoken by an estimated 8–11 million people in total. In addition to being spoken primarily in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Western China, mainly by the Uyghur people, Uyghur was also spoken by some 300,000 people in Kazakhstan in 1993, some 90,000 in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan in 1998, 3,000 in Afghanistan and 1,000 in Mongolia, both in 1982. Smaller communities also exist in Albania, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Tajikistan, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States (New York City).

The Uyghurs are one of the 56 recognized ethnic groups in China and Uyghur is an official language of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, along with Standard Chinese. As a result, Uyghur can be heard in most social domains in Xinjiang and also in schools, government and courts. Of the other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, those populous enough to have their own autonomous prefectures, such as the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz, have access to schools and government services in their native language. Smaller minorities, however, do not have a choice and must attend Uyghur-medium schools. These include the Xibe, Tajiks, Daurs and Russians. 

The Chinese government have implemented bi-lingual education in most regions of Xinjiang. The bi-lingual education system teaches Xinjiang&#x27;s students all STEM classes using only Mandarin Chinese, or a combination of Uighur and Chinese. However, research have shown that due to differences in the order of words and grammar between the Uighur and the Chinese language, many students face obstacles in learning courses such as Mathematics under the bi-lingual education system. 

Uyghur language has been supported by Google Translate since February 2020.

About 80 newspapers and magazines are available in Uyghur; five TV channels and ten publishers serve as the Uyghur media. Outside of China, Radio Free Asia provides news in Uyghur.

Poet and activist Muyesser Abdul&#x27;ehed teaches the language to diaspora children online as well as publishing a magazine written by children for children in Uyghur.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
Uyghur has a seven-vowel inventory, with and not distinguished. The vowel letters of the Uyghur language are, in their alphabetical order (in the Latin script), , , , , , , , . There are no diphthongs. Hiatus occurs in some loanwords.Uyghur vowels are distinguished on the bases of height, backness and roundness. It has been argued, within a lexical phonology framework, that has a back counterpart , and modern Uyghur lacks a clear differentiation between and .

Uyghur vowels are by default short, but long vowels also exist because of historical vowel assimilation (above) and through loanwords. Underlyingly long vowels would resist vowel reduction and devoicing, introduce non-final stress, and be analyzed as |Vj| or |Vr| before a few suffixes. However, the conditions in which they are actually pronounced as distinct from their short counterparts have not been fully researched.

The high vowels undergo some tensing when they occur adjacent to alveolars (), palatals (), dentals (), and post-alveolar affricates (), e.g. &quot;chiraq&quot; &#x27;lamp&#x27;, &quot;jenubiy&quot; &#x27;southern&#x27;, &quot;yüz&quot; &#x27;face; hundred&#x27;, &quot;suda&quot; &#x27;in/at (the) water&#x27;.

Both and undergo apicalisation after alveodental continuants in unstressed syllables, e.g. &quot;siler&quot; &#x27;you (plural)&#x27;, &quot;ziyan&quot; &#x27;harm&#x27;. They are medialised after or before , e.g. &quot;til&quot; &#x27;tongue&#x27;, &quot;xizmet&quot; &#x27;work; job; service&#x27;. After velars, uvulars and they are realised as , e.g. &quot;giram&quot; &#x27;gram&#x27;, &quot;xelqi&quot; &#x27;his [etc.] nation&#x27;, &quot;Finn&quot; &#x27;Finn&#x27;. Between two syllables that contain a rounded back vowel each, they are realised as back, e.g. &quot;qolimu&quot; &#x27;also his [etc.] arm&#x27;.

Any vowel undergoes laxing and backing when it occurs in uvular () and laryngeal (glottal) () environments, e.g. &quot;qiz&quot; &#x27;girl&#x27;, &quot;qëtiq&quot; &#x27;yogurt&#x27;, &quot;qeghez&quot; &#x27;paper&#x27;, &quot;qum&quot; &#x27;sand&#x27;, &quot;qolay&quot; &#x27;convenient&#x27;, &quot;qan&quot; &#x27;blood&#x27;, &quot;ëghiz&quot; &#x27;mouth&#x27;, &quot;hisab&quot; &#x27;number&#x27;, &quot;hës&quot; &#x27;hunch&#x27;, &quot;hemrah&quot; &#x27;partner&#x27;, &quot;höl&quot; &#x27;wet&#x27;, &quot;hujum&quot; &#x27;assault&#x27;, &quot;halqa&quot; &#x27;ring&#x27;.

Lowering tends to apply to the non-high vowels when a syllable-final liquid assimilates to them, e.g. &quot;kör&quot; &#x27;look!&#x27;, &quot;boldi&quot; &#x27;he [etc.] became&#x27;, &quot;ders&quot; &#x27;lesson&#x27;, &quot;tar&quot; &#x27;narrow&#x27;.

Official Uyghur orthographies do not mark vowel length, and also do not distinguish between (e.g., &#x27;knowledge&#x27;) and back (e.g., &#x27;my language&#x27;); these two sounds are in complementary distribution, but phonological analyses claim that they play a role in vowel harmony and are separate phonemes. only occurs in words of non-Turkic origin and as the result of vowel raising.

Uyghur has systematic vowel reduction (or vowel raising) as well as vowel harmony. Words usually agree in vowel backness, but compounds, loans, and some other exceptions often break vowel harmony. Suffixes surface with the rightmost [back] value in the stem, and are transparent (as they do not contrast for backness). Uyghur also has rounding harmony.

=== Consonants ===
Uyghur voiceless stops are aspirated word-initially and intervocalically. The pairs , , , and alternate, with the voiced member devoicing in syllable-final position, except in word-initial syllables. This devoicing process is usually reflected in the official orthography, but an exception has been recently made for certain Perso-Arabic loans. Voiceless phonemes do not become voiced in standard Uyghur.

Suffixes display a slightly different type of consonant alternation. The phonemes and anywhere in a suffix alternate as governed by vowel harmony, where occurs with front vowels and with back ones. Devoicing of a suffix-initial consonant can occur only in the cases of → , → , and → , when the preceding consonant is voiceless. Lastly, the rule that /g/ must occur with front vowels and with back vowels can be broken when either or in suffix-initial position becomes assimilated by the other due to the preceding consonant being such. 

Loan phonemes have influenced Uyghur to various degrees. and were borrowed from Arabic and have been nativized, while from Persian less so. only exists in very recent Russian and Chinese loans, since Perso-Arabic (and older Russian and Chinese) became Uyghur . Perso-Arabic loans have also made the contrast between and phonemic, as they occur as allophones in native words, the former set near front vowels and the latter near a back vowels. Some speakers of Uyghur distinguish from in Russian loans, but this is not represented in most orthographies. Other phonemes occur natively only in limited contexts, i.e. only in few interjections, , , and rarely initially, and only morpheme-final. Therefore, the pairs , , and do not alternate.

=== Phonotactics ===
The primary syllable structure of Uyghur is CV(C)(C). Uyghur syllable structure is usually CV or CVC, but CVCC can also occur in some words. When syllable-coda clusters occur, CC tends to become CVC in some speakers especially if the first consonant is not a sonorant. In Uyghur, any consonant phoneme can occur as the syllable onset or coda, except for which only occurs in the onset and , which never occurs word-initially. In general, Uyghur phonology tends to simplify phonemic consonant clusters by means of elision and epenthesis.

== Orthography ==

The Karluk language started to be written with the Perso-Arabic script (Kona Yëziq) in the 10th century upon the conversion of the Kara-Khanids to Islam. This Perso-Arabic script (Kona Yëziq) was reformed in the 20th century with modifications to represent all Modern Uyghur sounds including short vowels and eliminate Arabic letters representing sounds not found in Modern Uyghur. Unlike many other modern Turkic languages, Uyghur is primarily written using a Perso-Arabic-based alphabet, although a Cyrillic alphabet and two Latin alphabets also are in use to a much lesser extent. Unusually for an alphabet based on the Arabic script, full transcription of vowels is indicated. (Among the Arabic family of alphabets, only a few, such as Kurdish, distinguish all vowels without the use of optional diacritics.)

The four alphabets in use today can be seen below.

* Uyghur Arabic alphabet or &quot;UEY&quot;
* Uyghur Cyrillic alphabet or &quot;USY&quot;
* The Uyghur New Script or &quot;UYY&quot;
* Uyghur Latin alphabet or &quot;ULY&quot;

In the table below the alphabets are shown side-by-side for comparison, together with a phonetic transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

== Grammar ==

Like other Turkic languages, Uyghur is a head-final agglutinative language with a subject–object–verb word order. Nouns are inflected for number and case, but not gender and definiteness like in many other languages. There are two numbers: singular and plural and six different cases: nominative, accusative, dative, locative, ablative and genitive. Verbs are conjugated for tense: present and past; voice: causative and passive; aspect: continuous and mood: e.g. ability. Verbs may be negated as well.

== Lexicon ==
The core lexicon of the Uyghur language is of Turkic stock, but due to different kinds of language contact throughout its history, it has adopted many loanwords. Kazakh, Uzbek and Chagatai are all Turkic languages which have had a strong influence on Uyghur. Many words of Arabic origin have come into the language through Persian and Tajik, which again have come through Uzbek and to a greater extent, Chagatai. Many words of Arabic origin have also entered the language directly through Islamic literature after the introduction of Islam around the 10th century.

Chinese in Xinjiang and Russian elsewhere had the greatest influence on Uyghur. Loanwords from these languages are all quite recent, although older borrowings exist as well, such as borrowings from Dungan, a Mandarin language spoken by the Dungan people of Central Asia. A number of loanwords of German origin have also reached Uyghur through Russian.

Code-switching with Standard Chinese is common in spoken Uyghur, but stigmatized in formal contexts. Xinjiang Television and other mass media, for example, will use the rare Russian loanword &quot;aplisin&quot; (, &quot;apel&#x27;sin&quot;) for the word &quot;orange&quot;, rather than the ubiquitous Mandarin loanword &quot;juze&quot; (). In a sentence, this mixing might look like:Below are some examples of common loanwords in the Uyghur language.

<text>Oromo ( or ; ), historically also called Galla, which is regarded by the Oromo as pejorative, is an Afroasiatic language that belongs to the Cushitic branch. It is native to the Ethiopian state of Oromia and northern Kenya and is spoken predominantly by the Oromo people and neighboring ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa. It is used as a lingua franca particularly in the Oromia Region and northeastern Kenya.

With more than 41.7 million speakers making up 33.8% of the total Ethiopian population, Oromo has the largest number of native speakers in Ethiopia, and ranks as the second most widely spoken language in Ethiopia by total number of speakers (including second-language speakers) following Amharic. Forms of Oromo are spoken as a first language by an additional half-million people in parts of northern and eastern Kenya. It is also spoken by smaller numbers of emigrants in other African countries such as South Africa, Libya, Egypt and Sudan. Oromo is the most widely spoken Cushitic language and among the five languages of Africa with the largest mother-tongue populations. 

Oromo serves as one of the official working languages of Ethiopia and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system including Oromia, Harari and Dire Dawa regional states and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region. It is a language of primary education in Oromia, Harari, Dire Dawa, Benishangul-Gumuz and Addis Ababa and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region. It is used as an internet language for federal websites along with Tigrinya. Under Haile Selassie&#x27;s regime, Oromo was banned in education, in conversation, and in administrative matters.

== Varieties ==

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; (2015) assigns five ISO codes to Oromo:
:*Boranaa–Arsii–Gujii Oromo (Southern Oromo, including Gabra and Sakuye dialects), ISO code [gax]
:*Eastern Oromo (Harar), ISO code [hae]
:*Orma (Munyo, Orma, Waata/Sanye), ISO code [orc]
:*West–Central Oromo (Western Oromo and Central Oromo, including Mecha/Wollega, Raya, Wello (Kemise), Tulema/Shewa), ISO code [gaz]
:*Waata, ISO code [ssn]

Blench (2006) divides Oromo into four languages:
:*Western Oromo (Maca)
:*Shewa (Tuulama, Arsi)
:*Eastern Oromo (Harar)
:*Southern Oromo (Ajuran, Borana, Gabra, Munyo, Orma, Sakuye, Waata)

Some of the varieties of Oromo have been examined and classified.

== Speakers ==
About 85 percent of Oromo speakers live in Ethiopia, mainly in the Oromia Region. In addition, in Somalia there are also some speakers of the language. In Kenya, the Ethnologue also lists 627,000 speakers of Borana and Orma, two languages closely related to Ethiopian Oromo. Within Ethiopia, Oromo is the language with the largest number of native speakers.

Within Africa, Oromo is the language with the fourth most speakers, after Arabic (if one counts the mutually unintelligible spoken forms of Arabic as a single language and assumes the same for the varieties of Oromo), Swahili, and Hausa.

Besides first language speakers, a number of members of other ethnicities who are in contact with the Oromo speak it as a second language. See, for example, the Omotic-speaking Bambassi and the Nilo-Saharan-speaking Kwama in northwestern Oromia.

== Language policy ==
The Oromo people use a highly developed oral tradition. In the 19th century, scholars began writing in the Oromo language using Latin script. In 1842, Johann Ludwig Krapf began translations of the Gospels of John and Matthew into Oromo, as well as a first grammar and vocabulary. The first Oromo dictionary and grammar was produced by German scholar Karl Tutschek in 1844. The first printing of a transliteration of Oromo language was in 1846 in a German newspaper in an article on the Oromo in Germany.

After Abyssinia annexed Oromo&#x27;s territory, the language&#x27;s development into a full-fledged writing instrument was interrupted. The few works that had been published, most notably Onesimos Nesib&#x27;s and Aster Ganno&#x27;s translations of the Bible from the late 19th century, were written in the Ge&#x27;ez alphabet. Following the 1974 Revolution, the government undertook a literacy campaign in several languages, including Oromo, and publishing and radio broadcasts began in the language. All Oromo materials printed in Ethiopia at that time, such as the newspaper , and many others, were written in the traditional Ethiopic script.

Plans to introduce Oromo language instruction in schools, however, were not realized until the government of Mengistu Haile Mariam was overthrown in 1991, except in regions controlled by the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). With the creation of the regional state of Oromia under the new system of ethnic federalism in Ethiopia, it has been possible to introduce Oromo as the medium of instruction in elementary schools throughout the region, including areas where other ethnic groups live speaking their languages, and as a language of administration within the region. Since the OLF left the transitional Ethiopian government in the early 1990s, the Oromo Peoples&#x27; Democratic Organization (OPDO) continued developing Oromo in Ethiopia.

Radio broadcasts began in the Oromo language in Somalia in 1960 by Radio Mogadishu. The programme featured music and propaganda. A song (Liberation is Milk) became a hit in Ethiopia. To combat Somali wide-reaching influence, the Ethiopian Government initiated an Oromo language program radio of their own. Within Kenya there has been radio broadcasting in Oromo (in the Borana dialect) on the Voice of Kenya since at least the 1980s. The Borana Bible in Kenya was printed in 1995 using the Latin alphabet, but not using the same spelling rules as in Ethiopian Qubee. The first comprehensive online Oromo dictionary was developed by the Jimma Times Oromiffa Group (JTOG) in cooperation with SelamSoft. Voice of America also broadcasts in Oromo alongside its other horn of Africa programs. In May 2022, Google Translate added Afaan Oromo as translation. Oromo and Qubee are currently utilized by the Ethiopian government&#x27;s state radios, TV stations and regional government newspaper.

== Phonology and orthography ==

=== Writing systems ===

Oromo is written with a Latin alphabet called which was formally adopted in 1991. Various versions of the Latin-based orthography had been used previously, mostly by Oromos outside of Ethiopia and by the OLF by the late 1970s (Heine 1986). With the adoption of Qubee, it is believed more texts were written in the Oromo language between 1991 and 1997 than in the previous 100 years. In Kenya, the Borana and Waata also use Roman letters but with different systems.

The Sapalo script was an indigenous Oromo script invented by Sheikh Bakri Sapalo (1895–1980; also known by his birth name, Abubaker Usman Odaa) in the late 1950s, and used underground afterwards. Despite structural and organizational influences from Ge&#x27;ez and the Arabic script, it is a graphically independent creation designed specifically for Oromo phonology. It is largely an Abugida in nature, but lacks the inherent vowel present in many such systems; in actual use, all consonant characters are obligatorily marked either with vowel signs (producing CV syllables) or with separate marks used to denote geminated consonants or pure/standalone consonants not followed by a vowel (e.g. in word-final environments or as part of consonant clusters).

The Arabic script has also been used intermittently in areas with Muslim populations.

=== Consonant and vowel phonemes ===
Like most other Ethiopian languages, whether Semitic, Cushitic, or Omotic, Oromo has a set of ejective consonants, that is, voiceless stops or affricates that are accompanied by glottalization and an explosive burst of air. Oromo has another glottalized phone that is more unusual, an implosive retroflex stop, &quot;dh&quot; in Oromo orthography, a sound that is like an English &quot;d&quot; produced with the tongue curled back slightly and with the air drawn in so that a glottal stop is heard before the following vowel begins. It is retroflex in most dialects, though it is not strongly implosive and may reduce to a flap between vowels. One source describes it as voiceless .

Oromo has the typical Eastern Cushitic set of five short and five long vowels, indicated in the orthography by doubling the five vowel letters. The difference in length is contrastive, for example, &#x27;lake&#x27;, &#x27;new&#x27;. Gemination is also significant in Oromo. That is, consonant length can distinguish words from one another, for example, &#x27;bad&#x27;, &#x27;highland&#x27;.

In the Qubee alphabet, letters include the digraphs &quot;ch, dh, ny, ph, sh.&quot; Gemination is not obligatorily marked for digraphs, though some writers indicate it by doubling the first element: &#x27;be prepared&#x27;. In the charts below, the International Phonetic Alphabet symbol for a phoneme is shown in brackets where it differs from the Oromo letter. The phonemes appear in parentheses because they are only found in recently adopted words. There have been minor changes in the orthography since it was first adopted: () was originally rendered , and there has been some confusion among authors in the use of and in representing the phonemes and , with some early works using for and for and even for different phonemes depending on where it appears in a word. This article uses consistently for and for .



=== Tone and stress ===
Only the penultimate or final syllable of a root can have a high tone, and if the penultimate is high, the final must also be high; this implies that Oromo has a pitch-accent system (in which the tone need be specified only on one syllable, the others being predictable) rather than a tone system (in which each syllable must have its tone specified), although the rules are complex (each morpheme can contribute its own tone pattern to the word), so that &quot;one can call Oromo a pitch-accent system in terms of the basic lexical representation of pitch, and a tone system in terms of its surface realization.&quot; The stressed syllable is perceived as the first syllable of a word with high pitch.

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===

==== Gender ==== 
Similar to most other Afroasiatic languages, Oromo has two grammatical genders,
masculine and feminine, and all nouns belong to either one or the other.
Grammatical gender in Oromo enters into the grammar in the following ways:
*Verbs (except for the copula &quot;be&quot;) agree with their subjects in gender when the subject is third person singular (&quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;).
*Third person singular personal pronouns (&quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, etc., in English) have the gender of the noun they refer to.
*Adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender.
*Some possessive adjectives (&quot;my&quot;, &quot;your&quot;) agree with the nouns they modify in some dialects.

Except in some southern dialects, there is nothing in the form of most nouns that indicates their gender. A small number of nouns pairs for people, however, end in &#x27; (m.) and &#x27; (f.), as do adjectives when they are used as nouns: &#x27;brother&#x27;, &#x27;sister&#x27;, &#x27;the rich one (m.)&#x27;, &#x27;the poor one (f.)&#x27;. Grammatical gender normally agrees with natural gender for people and animals; thus nouns such as &#x27;father&#x27;, &#x27;son&#x27;, and &#x27;ox&#x27; are masculine, while nouns such as &#x27;mother&#x27; and &#x27;girl, daughter&#x27; are feminine. However, most names for animals do not specify biological gender.

Names of astronomical bodies are feminine: &#x27;sun&#x27;, &#x27;star&#x27;. The gender of other inanimate nouns varies somewhat among dialects. 

==== Number ====
Oromo displays singular and plural number, but nouns that refer to multiple entities are not obligatorily plural: &#x27;man&#x27; &#x27;people&#x27;, &#x27;five men&#x27; &#x27;five people&#x27;. Another way of looking at this is to treat the &quot;singular&quot; form as unspecified for number.

When it is important to make the plurality of a referent clear, the plural form of a noun is used. Noun plurals are formed through the addition of suffixes. The most common plural suffix is &#x27;; a final vowel is dropped before the suffix, and in the western dialects, the suffix becomes &#x27; following a syllable with a long vowel: &#x27;house&#x27;, &#x27;houses&#x27;, &#x27;friend&#x27;, &#x27;friends&#x27;, &#x27;teacher&#x27;, &#x27;teachers&#x27;. Among the other common plural suffixes are &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;&quot;; the latter two may cause a preceding consonant to be doubled: &#x27;year&#x27;, &#x27;years&#x27;, &#x27;river&#x27;, &#x27;rivers&#x27;, &#x27;son&#x27;, &#x27;sons&#x27;.

==== Definiteness ====
Oromo has no indefinite articles (corresponding to English &quot;a&quot;, &quot;some&quot;), but (except in the southern dialects) it indicates definiteness (English &quot;the&quot;) with suffixes on the noun: &#x27; for masculine nouns (the &quot;ch&quot; is geminated though this is not normally indicated in writing) and &#x27; for feminine nouns. Vowel endings of nouns are dropped before these suffixes: &#x27;road&#x27;, &#x27;the road&#x27;, &#x27;man&#x27;, / &#x27;the man&#x27;, &#x27;lake&#x27;, &#x27;the lake&#x27;. For animate nouns that can take either gender, the definite suffix may indicate the intended gender: &#x27;priest&#x27;, &#x27;the priest (m.)&#x27;, &#x27;the priest (f.)&#x27;. The definite suffixes appear to be used less often than &quot;the&quot; in English, and they seem not to co-occur with the plural suffixes.

==== Case ====
Oromo nouns appear in seven grammatical cases, each indicated by a suffix, the lengthening of the noun&#x27;s final vowel, or both. For some of the cases, there is a range of forms possible, some covering more than one case, and the differences in meaning among these alternatives may be quite subtle.

; Absolutive
:The absolutive case is the citation form or base form that is used when the noun is the object of a verb, the object of a preposition or postposition, or a nominal predicative.
:* &#x27;house&#x27;, &#x27;we bought a house&#x27;
:* &#x27;until&#x27;, &#x27;end&#x27;, &#x27;until (the) end&#x27;
:* , &#x27;inside (a/the) house&#x27;
:* &#x27;he&#x27;, &#x27;teacher&#x27; 
:* &#x27;he is a teacher&#x27;
; Nominative
: The nominative is used for nouns that are the subjects of clauses.
:* (a name), &#x27;Ibsaa (nom.)&#x27;, &#x27;(a) car&#x27;, &#x27;he has&#x27;:
:* &#x27;Ibsaa has a car&#x27;.
: Most nouns ending in short vowels with a preceding single consonant drop the final vowel and add &#x27; to form the nominative. Following certain consonants, assimilation changes either the &#x27; or that consonant (the details depend on the dialect).
:* &#x27;man&#x27;, &#x27;man (nom.)&#x27;
:* &#x27;men&#x27;; , &#x27;men (nom.)&#x27; (&#x27; + &#x27; may assimilate to &quot;)
: If a final short vowel is preceded by two consonants or a geminated consonant, &quot; is suffixed.
:* &#x27;statement&#x27;, &#x27;statement (nom.)&#x27;
:* &#x27;the man&#x27;, &#x27;the man (nom.)&#x27; (the &#x27; in the definite suffix &#x27; is actually geminated, though not normally written as such)
: If the noun ends in a long vowel, &#x27; is suffixed to this. This pattern applies to infinitives, which end in &#x27;.
:* &#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;name (nom.)&#x27;
:* &#x27;to eat, eating&#x27;, &#x27;to eat, eating (nom.)&#x27;
: If the noun ends in &quot;, the nominative is identical to the base form.
:* &#x27;mouth, language (base form or nom.)&#x27;
: Some feminine nouns ending in a short vowel add &quot;. Again assimilation occurs in some cases.
:* &#x27;mother&#x27;, (&#x27; + &#x27; assimilates to &quot;&quot;)
:* &#x27;earth&#x27;, 
; Genitive
: The genitive is used for possession or &quot;belonging&quot;; it corresponds roughly to English &quot;of&quot; or &#x27;. The genitive is usually formed by lengthening a final short vowel, by adding &#x27; to a final consonant, and by leaving a final long vowel unchanged. The possessor noun follows the possessed noun in a genitive phrase. Many such phrases with specific technical meanings have been added to the Oromo lexicon in recent years.
:* &#x27;sister&#x27;, &#x27;the man&#x27;, &#x27;the man&#x27;s sister&#x27;
:* &#x27;job&#x27;, , woman&#x27;s name, , &#x27;Caaltuu&#x27;s job&#x27;
:* &#x27;field of study&#x27;, &#x27;mouth, language&#x27;, &#x27;linguistics&#x27;
: In place of the genitive it is also possible to use the relative marker &#x27; (m.) / &#x27; (f.) preceding the possessor.
:* &#x27;the man&#x27;s sister&#x27;
; Dative
: The dative is used for nouns that represent the recipient (&quot;to&quot;) or the benefactor (&quot;for&quot;) of an event. The dative form of a verb infinitive (which acts like a noun in Oromo) indicates purpose. The dative takes one of the following forms:
:* Lengthening of a final short vowel (ambiguously also signifying the genitive)
::* &#x27;the man&#x27;, &#x27;to the man, of the man&#x27;
:*&#x27; following a long vowel or a lengthened short vowel; &#x27; following a consonant
::* &#x27;girl, daughter&#x27;, &#x27;to a girl, daughter&#x27;
::* &#x27;dog&#x27;, &#x27;to a dog&#x27;
::* &#x27;to learn&#x27;, &#x27;in order to learn&#x27;
::* &#x27;water&#x27;, &#x27;for water&#x27;
:*&#x27; or &#x27; following a long vowel
::* &#x27;dog&#x27;; &#x27;to a dog&#x27;
:*&quot;&quot; (with no change to a preceding vowel), especially with verbs of speaking
::* woman&#x27;s name, &#x27;tell, say (imperative)&#x27;, &#x27;tell Caaltuu&#x27;
; Instrumental
: The instrumental is used for nouns that represent the instrument (&quot;with&quot;), the means (&quot;by&quot;), the agent (&quot;by&quot;), the reason, or the time of an event. The formation of the instrumental parallels that of the dative to some extent:
:*&#x27; following a long vowel or a lengthened short vowel; &#x27; following a consonant
::* &#x27;hand&#x27;, &#x27;by hand, with a hand&#x27;
::* &#x27;night&#x27;, &#x27;at night&#x27;
:* following a long vowel or a lengthened short vowel
::* &#x27;Oromo (language)&#x27;, &#x27;in Oromo&#x27;
:*&quot;&quot; following a long vowel
::* &#x27;time&#x27;, &#x27;on time&#x27;
::* &#x27;to come out, coming out&#x27;, &#x27;by coming out&#x27;
; Locative
: The locative is used for nouns that represent general locations of events or states, roughly &quot;at&quot;. For more specific locations, Oromo uses prepositions or postpositions. Postpositions may also take the locative suffix. The locative also seems to overlap somewhat with the instrumental, sometimes having a temporal function. The locative is formed with the suffix &quot;&quot;.
:* &#x27;in Arsii&#x27;
:* &#x27;hand&#x27;, &#x27;in hand&#x27;
:* &#x27;day&#x27;, &#x27;per day&#x27;
:* &#x27;under&#x27;
; Ablative
: The ablative is used to represent the source of an event; it corresponds closely to English &quot;from&quot;. The ablative, applied to postpositions and locative adverbs as well as nouns proper, is formed in the following ways:
:* When the word ends in a short vowel, this vowel is lengthened (as for the genitive).
::* &#x27;country&#x27;, &#x27;from country&#x27;
::* &#x27;inside, in&#x27;, &#x27;from inside&#x27;
:* When the word ends in a long vowel, &quot; is added (as for one alternative for the dative).
::* &#x27;from Finfinne&#x27;
::* &#x27;market&#x27;, &#x27;from market&#x27;
:* When the word ends in a consonant, &quot; is added (as for the genitive).
::* &#x27;from Harar&#x27;
:* Following a noun in the genitive, &quot; is added.
::* &#x27;house&#x27;, &#x27;coffee&#x27;, &#x27;cafe&#x27;, &#x27;from cafe&#x27;
: An alternative to the ablative is the postposition &quot; &#x27;from&#x27; whose initial vowel may be dropped in the process:
:* &#x27;market&#x27;, &#x27;from market&#x27;

=== Pronouns ===

==== Personal pronouns ====
In most languages, there is a small number of basic distinctions of person, number, and often gender that play a role within the grammar of the language. Oromo and English are such languages. We see these distinctions within the basic set of independent personal pronouns, for example, English &quot;I&quot;, Oromo ; English &quot;they&quot;, Oromo &quot; and the set of possessive adjectives and pronouns, for example, English &quot;my&quot;, Oromo ; English &quot;mine&quot;, Oromo . In Oromo, the same distinctions are also reflected in subject–verb agreement: Oromo verbs (with a few exceptions) agree with their subjects; that is, the person, number, and (singular third person) gender of the subject of the verb are marked by suffixes on the verb. Because these suffixes vary greatly with the particular verb tense/aspect/mood, they are normally not considered to be pronouns and are discussed elsewhere in this article under verb conjugation.

In all of these areas of the grammar—independent pronouns, possessive adjectives, possessive pronouns, and subject–verb agreement—Oromo distinguishes seven combinations of person, number, and gender. For first and second persons, there is a two-way distinction between singular (&#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;you sg.&#x27;) and plural (&#x27;we&#x27;, &#x27;you pl.&#x27;), whereas for third person, there is a two-way distinction in the singular (&#x27;he&#x27;, &#x27;she&#x27;) and a single form for the plural (&#x27;they&#x27;). Because Oromo has only two genders, there is no pronoun corresponding to English &quot;it&quot;; the masculine or feminine pronoun is used according to the gender of the noun referred to.

Oromo is a subject pro-drop language. That is, neutral sentences in which the subject is not emphasized do not require independent subject pronouns: &#x27;we came yesterday&#x27;.
The Oromo word that translates &#x27;we&#x27; does not appear in this sentence, though the person and number are marked on the verb (&#x27;we came&#x27;) by the suffix &#x27;. When the subject in such sentences needs to be given prominence for some reason, an independent pronoun can be used: &quot; we&quot; came yesterday&#x27;.

The table below gives forms of the personal pronouns in the different cases, as well as the possessive adjectives. For the first person plural and third person singular feminine categories, there is considerable variation across dialects; only some of the possibilities are shown.

The possessive adjectives, treated as separate words here, are sometimes written as noun suffixes. In most dialects there is a distinction between masculine and feminine possessive adjectives for first and second person (the form agreeing with the gender of the modified noun). However, in the western dialects, the masculine forms (those beginning with &#x27;) are used in all cases. Possessive adjectives may take the case endings for the nouns they modify: &#x27;to my village&#x27; (&#x27;: locative case).

As in languages such as French, Russian, and Turkish, the Oromo second person plural is also used as a polite singular form, for reference to people that the speaker wishes to show respect towards. This usage is an example of the so-called T-V distinction that is made in many languages. In addition, the third person plural may be used for polite reference to a single third person (either &#x27;he&#x27; or &#x27;she&#x27;).

For possessive pronouns (&#x27;mine&#x27;, &#x27;yours&#x27;, etc.), Oromo adds the possessive adjectives to &#x27;of&#x27;: &#x27;mine&#x27;, &#x27;yours&#x27;, etc.

==== Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns ====
Oromo has two ways of expressing reflexive pronouns (&#x27;myself&#x27;, &#x27;yourself&#x27;, etc.). One is to use the noun meaning &#x27;self&#x27;: or . This noun is inflected for case but, unless it is being emphasized, not for person, number, or gender: &#x27;she looks at herself&#x27; (base form of ), &#x27;she bought herself a car&#x27; (dative of ).

The other possibility is to use the noun meaning &#x27;head&#x27;, , with possessive suffixes: &#x27;myself&#x27;, &#x27;yourself (s.)&#x27;, etc.

Oromo has a reciprocal pronoun (English &#x27;each other&#x27;) that is used like . That is, it is inflected for case but not person, number, or gender: &#x27;they like each other&#x27; (base form of ), &#x27;they bought each other gifts&#x27; (dative of ).

==== Demonstrative pronouns ====
Like English, Oromo makes a two-way distinction between proximal (&#x27;this, these&#x27;) and distal (&#x27;that, those&#x27;) demonstrative pronouns and adjectives. Some dialects distinguish masculine and feminine for the proximal pronouns; in the western dialects the masculine forms (beginning with &quot;&quot;) are used for both genders. Unlike in English, singular and plural demonstratives are not distinguished, but, as for nouns and personal pronouns in the language, case is distinguished. Only the base and nominative forms are shown in the table below; the other cases are formed from the base form as for nouns, for example, &#x27;at/on/in that&#x27; (locative case).
=== Verbs ===
An Oromo verb consists minimally of a stem, representing the lexical meaning of the verb, and a suffix, representing tense or aspect and subject agreement. For example, in &#x27;we came&#x27;, &#x27; is the stem (&#x27;come&#x27;) and &#x27; indicates that the tense is past and that the subject of the verb is first person plural.

As in many other Afroasiatic languages, Oromo makes a basic two-way distinction in its verb system between the two tensed forms, past (or &quot;perfect&quot;) and present (or &quot;imperfect&quot; or &quot;non-past&quot;). Each of these has its own set of tense/agreement suffixes. There is a third conjugation based on the present which has three functions: it is used in place of the present in subordinate clauses, for the jussive (&#x27;let me/us/him, etc. V&#x27;, together with the particle ), and for the negative of the present (together with the particle ). For example, &#x27;we went&#x27;, &#x27;we go&#x27;, &#x27;that we go&#x27;, &#x27;let&#x27;s go&#x27;, &#x27;we don&#x27;t go&#x27;. There is also a separate imperative form: &#x27;go (sg.)!&#x27;.

==== Conjugation ====
The table below shows the conjugation in the affirmative and negative of the verb &#x27; &#x27;know&#x27;. The first person singular present and past affirmative forms require the suffix &#x27; to appear on the word preceding the verb or the word &#x27; before the verb. The negative particle &#x27;, shown as a separate word in the table, is sometimes written as a prefix on the verb.

For verbs with stems ending in certain consonants and suffixes beginning with consonants (that is, &#x27; or &#x27;), there are predictable changes to one or the other of the consonants. The dialects vary a lot in the details, but the following changes are common.

Verbs whose stems end in two consonants and whose suffix begins with a consonant must insert a vowel to break up the consonants since the language does not permit sequences of three consonants. There are two ways this can happen: either the vowel &quot;i&quot; is inserted between the stem and the suffix, or the final stem consonants are switched (an example of metathesis) and the vowel &quot;a&quot; is inserted between them. For example, &#x27;see&#x27;, &#x27;he sees&#x27;, or (from ) &#x27;we see&#x27;; &#x27;laugh&#x27;, &#x27;he laughed&#x27;, or &#x27;you (sg.) laughed&#x27;.

Verbs whose stems end in the consonant &#x27; (which may appear as &quot;h&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, or &quot;y&quot; in some words, depending on the dialect) belong to three different conjugation classes; the class is not predictable from the verb stem. It is the forms that precede suffixes beginning with consonants (&quot;t&quot; and &quot;n&quot;) that differ from the usual pattern. The third person masculine singular, second person singular, and first person plural present forms are shown for an example verb in each class.
# &#x27;- &#x27;die&#x27;: &#x27; &#x27;he dies&#x27;, &#x27;you (sg.) die&#x27;, &#x27;we die&#x27;
# &#x27;-, &#x27;be hungry&#x27;: &#x27; &#x27;he is hungry&#x27;, &#x27;you (sg.) are hungry&#x27;, &#x27;we are hungry&#x27;
# &#x27;- &#x27;hear&#x27;: &#x27; &#x27;he hears&#x27;, &#x27;you (sg.) hear&#x27;, &#x27;we hear&#x27; (the suffix consonants change)

The common verbs &#x27;want&#x27; and &#x27;do&#x27; deviate from the basic conjugation pattern in that long vowels replace the geminated consonants that would result when suffixes beginning with &quot;t&quot; or &quot;n&quot; are added: &#x27;he wants&#x27;, &#x27;you (sg.) want&#x27;, &#x27;we want&#x27;, &#x27;you (pl.) want&#x27;, &#x27;didn&#x27;t want&#x27;, etc.

The verb &#x27;come&#x27; has the irregular imperatives , . The verb &#x27;go&#x27; has, alongside regular imperative forms, the irregular imperatives , .

==== Derivation ====
An Oromo verb root can be the basis for three derived voices, passive, causative, and autobenefactive, each formed with addition of a suffix to the root, yielding the stem that the inflectional suffixes are added to.
; Passive voice
: The Oromo passive corresponds closely to the English passive in function. It is formed by adding &quot;-am&quot; to the verb root. The resulting stem is conjugated regularly. Examples: &#x27;know&#x27;, &#x27;be known&#x27;, &#x27;they were known&#x27;; &#x27;say&#x27;, &#x27;be said&#x27;, &#x27;it is said&#x27;
; Causative voice
: The Oromo causative of a verb V corresponds to English expressions such as &#x27;cause V&#x27;, &#x27;make V&#x27;, &#x27;let V&#x27;. With intransitive verbs, it has a transitivizing function. It is formed by adding &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-sis&quot;, or &quot;-siis&quot; to the verb root, except that roots ending in &quot;-l&quot; add &quot;-ch&quot;. Verbs whose roots end in &#x27; drop this consonant and may lengthen the preceding vowel before adding &quot;-s&quot;. Examples: &#x27;know&#x27;, &#x27;cause to know, inform&#x27;, &#x27;we informed&#x27;; &#x27;- &#x27;go up, get up&#x27;, &#x27;pick up&#x27;, &#x27;pick up (sing.)!&#x27;; &#x27;enter&#x27;, &#x27;put in&#x27;, &#x27;she puts in&#x27;; &#x27;learn&#x27;, &#x27;teach&#x27;, &#x27;I teach&#x27;.
; Autobenefactive voice
: The Oromo autobenefactive (or &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;reflexive-middle&quot;) voice of a verb V corresponds roughly to English expressions such as &#x27;V for oneself&#x27; or &#x27;V on one&#x27;s own&#x27;, though the precise meaning may be somewhat unpredictable for many verbs. It is formed by adding &quot;-adh&quot; to the verb root. The conjugation of a middle verb is irregular in the third person singular masculine of the present and past (&quot;-dh&quot; in the stem changes to &quot;-t&quot;) and in the singular imperative (the suffix is &quot;-u&quot; rather than &quot;-i&quot;). Examples: &#x27;buy&#x27;, &#x27;buy for oneself&#x27;, &#x27;he bought (something) for himself&#x27;, &#x27;buy for yourself (sing.)!&#x27;; &#x27;have&#x27;, &#x27;seize, hold (for oneself)&#x27;, &#x27;we hold&#x27;. Some autobenefactives are derived from nouns rather than verbs, for example, &#x27;work&#x27; from the noun &#x27;work&#x27;.

The voice suffixes can be combined in various ways. Two causative suffixes are possible: &#x27;- &#x27;go up&#x27;, &#x27;pick up&#x27;, &#x27;cause to pick up&#x27;. The causative may be followed by the passive or the autobenefactive; in this case the &quot;s&quot; of the causative is replaced by &quot;f&quot;: &#x27;- &#x27;return (intransitive)&#x27;, &#x27;return (transitive), answer&#x27;, &#x27;be returned, be answered&#x27;, &#x27;get back for oneself&#x27;.

Another derived verbal aspect is the frequentative or &quot;intensive,&quot; formed by copying the first consonant and vowel of the verb root and geminating the second occurrence of the initial consonant. The resulting stem indicates the repetition or intensive performance of the action of the verb. Examples: &#x27;spend the night&#x27;, &#x27;spend several nights&#x27;, &#x27;break&#x27;, &#x27;break to pieces, break completely&#x27;; &#x27;push, apply pressure&#x27;, &#x27;massage&#x27;.

The infinitive is formed from a verb stem with the addition of the suffix &quot;-uu&quot;. Verbs whose stems end in &quot;-dh&quot; (in particular all autobenefactive verbs) change this to &quot;ch&quot; before the suffix. Examples: &#x27;drink&#x27;, &#x27;to drink&#x27;; &#x27;- &#x27;reach&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;to reach&#x27;; &#x27;say&#x27;, &#x27;to say&#x27;. The verb is exceptional; its infinitive is rather than the expected . The infinitive behaves like a noun; that is, it can take any of the case suffixes. Examples: &#x27; &#x27;to reach&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;in order to reach&#x27; (dative case); &#x27;drink&#x27;, &#x27;be drunk&#x27;, to be drunk&#x27;, &#x27;by being drunk&#x27; (instrumental case).

<text>Fifth Avenue is a major thoroughfare in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The avenue stretches southward from West 143rd Street in Harlem to Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. The section in Midtown Manhattan is one of the most expensive shopping streets in the world.

Fifth Avenue carries two-way traffic between 143rd and 135th Streets, and one-way traffic southbound for the remainder of its route. The entire avenue carried two-way traffic until 1966. From 124th to 120th Streets, Fifth Avenue is cut off by Marcus Garvey Park, with southbound traffic diverted around the park via Mount Morris Park West and northbound to Madison Avenue. Most of the avenue has a bus lane, though not a bike lane. Fifth Avenue is the traditional route for many celebratory parades in New York City, and is closed to automobile traffic on several Sundays each year.

Fifth Avenue was originally only a narrower thoroughfare but the section south of Central Park was widened in 1908. The midtown blocks between 34th and 59th Streets were largely a residential area until the turn of the 20th century, when they were developed as commercial areas. The section of Fifth Avenue in the 50s is consistently ranked among the most expensive shopping streets in the world, and the section between 59th and 96th Streets across Central Park was nicknamed &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot; in the early 20th century due to the high concentration of mansions there. A section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 110th Streets, also alongside Central Park, is also nicknamed Museum Mile due to its large number of museums.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Fifth Avenue between 42nd Street and Central Park South (59th Street) was relatively undeveloped through the late 19th century. The surrounding area was once part of the common lands of the city of New York, which was allocated &quot;all the waste, vacant, unpatented, and unappropriated lands&quot; as a result of the 1686 Dongan Charter. The city&#x27;s Common Council came to own a large amount of land, primarily in the middle of the island away from the Hudson and East Rivers, as a result of grants by the Dutch provincial government to the colony of New Amsterdam. Although originally more extensive, by 1785 the council held approximately , or about 9 percent of the island.

The lots along what is now Fifth Avenue were laid out in the late 18th century following the American Revolutionary War. The city&#x27;s Common Council had, starting in June 1785, attempted to raise money by selling property. The land that the Council owned was not suitable for farming or residential estates, and it was also far away from any roads or waterways. To divide the common lands into sellable lots, and to lay out roads to service them, the Council hired Casimir Goerck to survey them. Goerck was instructed to make lots of about each and to lay out roads to access the lots. He completed his task in December 1785, creating 140 lots of varying sizes, oriented with the east–west axis longer than the north–south axis. As part of the plan, Goerck drew up a street called Middle Road, which eventually became Fifth Avenue.

The topography of the lots contributed to the public&#x27;s reluctance to buy the lots. By 1794, with the city growing ever more populated and the inhabited area constantly moving north towards the Common Lands, the Council decided to try again, hiring Goerck once more to re-survey and map the area. He was instructed to make the lots more uniform and rectangular and to lay out roads to the west and east of Middle Road, as well as to lay out east–west streets of each. Goerck&#x27;s East and West Roads later became Fourth and Sixth Avenues, while Goerck&#x27;s cross streets became the modern-day numbered east–west streets. Goerck took two years to survey the 212 lots which encompassed the entire Common Lands. The Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, which prescribed the street plan for Manhattan, was heavily inspired from Goerck&#x27;s two surveys.

=== 19th century ===

From the early 19th century, some plots on Fifth Avenue in Midtown were acquired by the wealthy and by institutions. In the mid-19th century, Fifth Avenue between 40th and 59th Streets was home to several institutions such as the Colored Orphan Asylum, the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, and St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital. Other uses such as a cattle farm remained until the 1860s. One of the first large houses to be built on Fifth Avenue was Henry J. Brevoort&#x27;s three-story residence at Ninth Street, which was completed in 1834. Subsequently, other farm owners decided to build houses along Fifth Avenue and its cross-streets.

The portion of Fifth Avenue in Midtown became an upscale residential area following the American Civil War. Among the first people to develop such structures was Mary Mason Jones, who built the &quot;Marble Row&quot; on the eastern side of Fifth Avenue from 57th to 58th Streets between 1868 and 1870. Her sister Rebecca Colford Jones erected ornate houses of her own one block south. Further development came in the late 1870s with the construction of three Vanderbilt family residences along Fifth Avenue between 51st and 59th Streets (the William H., William K., and Cornelius II mansions). In the 1880s and 1890s, the ten blocks of Fifth Avenue south of Central Park (at 59th Street) were known as &quot;Vanderbilt Row&quot;.

The Vanderbilts&#x27; relocation prompted many business owners on Fifth Avenue between Madison Square and 34th Street to move uptown. The upper section of Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side, facing the newly created Central Park, was not developed at that time because of what the &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; described as the presence of &quot;no opposite neighbors&quot;, as the Upper West Side was not yet developed. Wealthy New Yorkers were buying land between 50th and 80th Streets and developing houses there in the 1880s. By 1915, the mansions on Fifth Avenue stretched all the way to 96th Street.

=== Early 20th century ===

The midtown blocks were largely a residential area until the turn of the 20th century, when they were developed as commercial areas. As early as 1900, rising traffic led to proposals to restrict traffic on the avenue. The section south of Central Park was widened starting in 1908, sacrificing wide sidewalks to accommodate the increasing traffic. As part of the widening project, the New York City government ordered the removal of stoops and other &quot;encroachments&quot; onto the sidewalk in February 1908. The buildings that needed to be trimmed included the Waldorf–Astoria hotel. By early 1911, the avenue had been widened south of 47th Street. Later that year, when widening commenced on the section between 47th and 59th Streets, many of the mansions on that stretch of Fifth Avenue were truncated or demolished. In addition, the front facades of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church were relocated, and the gardens in front of the St. Regis and Gotham hotels had to be destroyed.

The first commercial building on Fifth Avenue was erected by Benjamin Altman, who bought the corner lot on the northeast corner of 34th Street in 1896. The B. Altman and Company Building was erected between 1906 and 1914, occupying the whole of its block front. The result was the creation of a high-end shopping district that attracted fashionable women and the upscale stores that wished to serve them. The Lord &amp; Taylor Building, formerly Lord &amp; Taylor&#x27;s flagship store and now an Amazon.com office, was built at Fifth Avenue and 38th Street in 1914. The Saks Fifth Avenue Building, serving as Saks Fifth Avenue&#x27;s flagship, opened between 49th and 50th Streets in 1924. The Bergdorf Goodman Building between 57th and 58th Streets, the flagship of Bergdorf Goodman, opened in stages between 1928 and 1929.

By the 1920s, Fifth Avenue was the most active area for development in Midtown, and developers were starting to build north of 45th Street, which had previously been considered the boundary for profitable developments. The most active year for construction in that decade was 1926, when thirty office buildings were constructed on Fifth Avenue. The two-block-wide area between Fifth and Park Avenues, which represented eight percent of Manhattan&#x27;s land area, contained 25% of developments that commenced between 1924 and 1926. On the Upper East Side, many of the mansions on Fifth Avenue were replaced with luxury apartment buildings beginning in the 1920s. In many cases, these mansion owners could no longer afford the upkeep or staffing costs of these mansions.

In the 1920s, traffic towers controlled important intersections along the lower portion of Fifth Avenue. The idea of using patrolmen to control traffic at busy Fifth Avenue intersections was introduced as early as 1914. The first such towers were installed in 1920 upon a gift by Dr. John A. Harriss, who paid for patrolmen&#x27;s sheds in the middle of Fifth Avenue at 34th, 38th, 42nd, 50th and 57th Streets. Two years later, the Fifth Avenue Association gave seven bronze traffic towers, designed by Joseph H. Freedlander, at important intersections between 14th and 57th Streets for a total cost of $126,000. The traffic signals reduced travel time along Fifth Avenue between 34th and 57th Streets, from 40 minutes before the installation of the traffic towers to 15 minutes afterward. Freedlander&#x27;s towers were removed in 1929 after they were deemed to be obstacles to the movement of traffic. He was commissioned to design bronze traffic signals at the corners of these intersections, with statues of Mercury atop the signals. The Mercury signals survived through 1964, and some of the statues were restored in 1971.

=== Mid- and late 20th century ===
In 1954, rising traffic led to a proposal to limit use of the avenue to buses and taxis only. On January 14, 1966, Fifth Avenue below 135th Street was changed to carry only one-way traffic southbound, and Madison Avenue was changed to one-way northbound. Both avenues had previously carried bidirectional traffic.

Through the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of the upscale retailers that once lined Fifth Avenue&#x27;s midtown section moved away or closed altogether. According to a 1971 survey of the avenue, conducted by the Office of Midtown Planning under the leadership of Jaquelin T. Robertson, only 57 percent of building frontages between 34th and 57th Street were used as stores. The remaining frontage, including was used for companies such as banks and airline ticket offices. The section between 34th and 42nd Street, once the main shopping district on Fifth Avenue, was identified in the survey as being in decline. The section between 42nd and 50th Street was characterized as having almost no ground-level retail. The section between 50th Street and Grand Army Plaza was identified as having a robust retail corridor that was starting to decay.

In February 1971, New York City mayor John Lindsay proposed a special zoning district to preserve the retail character of Fifth Avenue&#x27;s midtown section. The legislation prescribed a minimum percentage of retail space for new buildings on Fifth Avenue, but it also provided &quot;bonuses&quot;, such as additional floor area, for buildings that had more than the minimum amount of retail. The legislation also encouraged the construction of several mixed-use buildings with retail at the lowest stories, offices at the middle stories, and apartments at the top stories. The types of retail included in this legislation were strictly defined; for example, airline ticket offices and banks did not count toward the retail space. Furthermore, new skyscrapers on the eastern side of the avenue were allowed to be built up to the boundary of the sidewalk. To align with the buildings of Rockefeller Center, new buildings on the western side had to contain a setback at least deep at a height of or lower. The New York City Planning Commission approved this legislation in March 1971. The legislation was adopted that April. Just before the legislation was enacted, American Airlines leased a ground-level storefront on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street; Robertson initially disputed the move, even though it had been finalized before the legislation was proposed. As part of an experiment in 1970, Lindsay closed Fifth Avenue between 42nd and 57th Street to vehicular traffic for seven hours on Saturdays.

In 1997, a midblock crosswalk was installed south of the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 50th Street, part of an experiment to allow vehicular traffic to turn without conflicting with pedestrians. The former southern crosswalk at Fifth Avenue and 50th Street was fenced off; the relocated crosswalk was one of a few midblock crosswalks in the city. A similar crosswalk was later installed south of 49th Street. Both of the recessed crosswalks were removed in 2018.

=== 21st century ===
In June 2020, mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would test out busways on Fifth Avenue from 57th to 34th Street, banning through traffic from private vehicles. Despite an October 2020 deadline, the Fifth Avenue busway was not in place at that time. Due to opposition from local business owners, the busway was ultimately downsized.

In December 2022, Mayor Eric Adams proposed rebuilding the midtown section of Fifth Avenue, and the NYCDOT temporarily closed Fifth Avenue between 48th and 57th Streets to all vehicular traffic for three weekends. Excluding special events such as parades, this was the first time since the 1970s that the midtown section of Fifth Avenue was closed to vehicular traffic. In October 2024, Adams and the Future of Fifth Partnership proposed redesigning Fifth Avenue between 60th and 40th Streets. The proposal would cost $230 million and would include widening sidewalks from ; removing two of the five traffic lanes; and adding benches, planters, and 230 trees. The plans did not include a bike lane for the avenue, as previous proposals had entailed; instead, an existing bike lane on Sixth Avenue would be widened for two-way bike traffic. If the plans received final approval, the avenue could be rebuilt starting in 2028. Adams announced in December 2024 that the city government would spend at least $150 million rebuilding Fifth Avenue in midtown.

==Description==

Fifth Avenue originates at Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village and runs northwards through the heart of Midtown, along the eastern side of Central Park, where it forms the boundary of the Upper East Side and through Harlem, where it terminates at the Harlem River at 142nd Street. Traffic crosses the river on the Madison Avenue Bridge.

Fifth Avenue serves as the dividing line for house numbering and west–east streets in Manhattan; for example, it separates East 59th Street from West 59th Street. Higher-numbered avenues such as Sixth Avenue are to the west of Fifth Avenue, while lower-numbered avenues such as Third Avenue are to the east. Address numbers on west–east streets increase in both directions as one moves away from Fifth Avenue. A hundred street address numbers were provided for every block to the east or west of Fifth Avenue; for instance, the addresses on West 50th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues were numbered 1–99 West 50th Street, and between Sixth and Seventh Avenues 100–199 West 50th Street. The building lot numbering system worked similarly on the East Side before Madison and Lexington Avenues were added to the street grid laid out in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811. Unlike at other avenues, west–east street addresses do not increment to the next hundred to the east of Madison and Lexington Avenues.

The &quot;most expensive street in the world&quot; moniker changes depending on currency fluctuations and local economic conditions from year to year. For several years starting in the mid-1990s, the shopping district between 49th and 57th Streets was ranked as having the world&#x27;s most expensive retail spaces on a cost per square foot basis. In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Fifth Avenue as being the most expensive street in the world. Some of the most coveted real estate on Fifth Avenue are the penthouses perched atop the buildings.

The American Planning Association (APA) compiled a list of &quot;2012 Great Places in America&quot; and declared Fifth Avenue to be one of the greatest streets to visit in America. This historic street has many world-renowned museums, businesses and stores, parks, luxury apartments, and historical landmarks that are reminiscent of its history and vision for the future.

===Traffic pattern===

Fifth Avenue from 142nd Street to 135th Street carries two-way traffic. Fifth Avenue carries one-way traffic southbound from 143rd Street to 142nd Street and from 135th Street to Washington Square North. The changeover to one-way traffic south of 135th Street took place on January 14, 1966, at which time Madison Avenue was changed to one way uptown (northbound). From 124th Street to 120th Street, Fifth Avenue is cut off by Marcus Garvey Park, with southbound traffic diverted around the park via Mount Morris Park West.

====Parade route====
Fifth Avenue is the traditional route for many celebratory parades in New York City; thus, it is closed to traffic on numerous Sundays in warm weather. The longest running parade is the annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade. Parades held are distinct from the &quot;ticker-tape parades&quot; held on the &quot;Canyon of Heroes&quot; on lower Broadway, and the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade held on Broadway from the Upper West Side downtown to Herald Square. Fifth Avenue parades usually proceed from south to north, with the exception of the LGBT Pride March, which goes north to south to end in Greenwich Village. The Latino literary classic by New Yorker Giannina Braschi, entitled &quot;Empire of Dreams&quot;, takes place on the Puerto Rican Day Parade on Fifth Avenue.

====Bicycling route====
Bicycling on Fifth Avenue ranges from segregated with a bike lane south of 23rd Street, to scenic along Central Park, to dangerous through Midtown with very heavy traffic during rush hours. There is no dedicated bike lane along most of Fifth Avenue. A protected bike lane south of 23rd Street was added in 2017, and another protected lane for bidirectional bike traffic between 110th and 120th Streets was announced in 2020.

In July 1987, New York City Mayor Ed Koch proposed banning bicycling on Fifth, Park, and Madison Avenues during weekdays, but many bicyclists protested and had the ban overturned. When the trial was started on August 24, 1987, for 90 days to ban bicyclists from these three avenues from 31st Street to 59th Street between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on weekdays, mopeds would not be banned. On August 31, 1987, a state appeals court judge halted the ban for at least a week pending a ruling after opponents against the ban brought a lawsuit. A bike lane on Fifth Avenue between 59th and 42nd Streets was proposed in late 2022.

===Public transportation===
====Bus====
Fifth Avenue is one of the few major streets in Manhattan along which streetcars did not operate. Instead, transportation along Fifth Avenue was initially provided by the Fifth Avenue Transportation Company, which provided horse-drawn service from 1885 to 1896. It was replaced by Fifth Avenue Coach, which continued to offer bus service. Double-decker buses were operated by the Fifth Avenue Coach Company until 1953 and again by MTA Regional Bus Operations from 1976 to 1978.

A bus lane for Fifth Avenue within Midtown was announced in 1982. Initially it ran from 59th to 34th Streets.

* at 
* at 
* at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street
* at Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street

==Nicknames==


===Upper Fifth Avenue/Millionaire&#x27;s Row===
In the late 19th century, the very rich of New York began building mansions along the stretch of Fifth Avenue between 59th Street and 96th Street, looking onto Central Park. By the early 20th century, the portion of Fifth Avenue between 59th and 96th Streets had been nicknamed &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot;, with mansions such as the Mrs. William B. Astor House and William A. Clark House. Entries to Central Park along this stretch include Inventor&#x27;s Gate at 72nd Street, which gave access to the park&#x27;s carriage drives, and Engineers&#x27; Gate at 90th Street, used by equestrians.

A milestone change for Fifth Avenue came in 1916, when the grand corner mansion at 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue that James A. Burden Jr. had erected in 1893 became the first private mansion on Fifth Avenue above 59th Street to be demolished to make way for a grand apartment house. The building at 907 Fifth Avenue began a trend, with its 12 stories around a central court, with two apartments to a floor. Its strong cornice above the fourth floor, just at the eaves height of its neighbors, was intended to soften its presence.

In January 1922, the city reacted to complaints about the ongoing replacement of Fifth Avenue&#x27;s mansions by apartment buildings by restricting the height of future structures to , about half the height of a ten-story apartment building. Architect J. E. R. Carpenter brought suit, and won a verdict overturning the height restriction in 1923. Carpenter argued that &quot;the avenue would be greatly improved in appearance when deluxe apartments would replace the old-style mansions.&quot; Led by real estate investors Benjamin Winter, Sr. and Frederick Brown, the old mansions were quickly torn down and replaced with apartment buildings.

This area contains many notable apartment buildings, including 810 Fifth Avenue and the Park Cinq, many of them built in the 1920s by architects such as Rosario Candela and J. E. R. Carpenter. A very few post-World War II structures break the unified limestone frontage, notably the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum between 88th and 89th Streets.

===Museum Mile===
Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 110th streets on the Upper East Side, in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill. The Mile, which contains one of the densest displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than one mile (1.6 km). Nine museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue. A ninth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble in 2009; its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959, opened in late 2012.

In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival to promote the museums and increase visitation. The Museum Mile Festival traditionally takes place here on the second Tuesday in June from 6 – 9 p.m. It was established in 1979 by Lisa Taylor to increase public awareness of its member institutions and promote public support of the arts in New York City. The first festival was held on June 26, 1979. The nine museums are open free that evening to the public. Several of the participating museums offer outdoor art activities for children, live music and street performers. During the event, Fifth Avenue is closed to traffic.

Museums on the mile include:
* 110th Street – The Africa Center
* 105th Street – El Museo del Barrio
* 103rd Street – Museum of the City of New York
* 92nd Street – The Jewish Museum
* 91st Street – Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum (part of the Smithsonian Institution)
* 89th Street – National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts
* 88th Street – Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
* 86th Street – Neue Galerie New York
* 82nd Street – The Metropolitan Museum of Art

Further south, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, lies the Henry Clay Frick House, which houses the Frick Collection.

== Historical landmarks ==
Buildings on Fifth Avenue can have one of several types of official landmark designations:
* The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is the New York City agency that is responsible for identifying and designating the city&#x27;s landmarks and the buildings in the city&#x27;s historic districts. New York City landmarks (NYCL) can be categorized into one of several groups: individual (exterior), interior, and scenic landmarks.
* The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government&#x27;s official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance.
* The National Historic Landmark (NHL) focuses on places of significance in American history, architecture, engineering, or culture; all NHL sites are also on the NRHP.
* World Heritage Sites are designated by UNESCO as having cultural, historical, scientific or other form of significance, and are legally protected by international treaties.

=== Individual landmarks ===
Below is a list of historic sites on Fifth Avenue, from north to south. Historic districts are not included in this table, but are mentioned in . Buildings within historic districts, but no individual landmark designation, are not included in this table.

=== Historic districts ===
There are numerous historic districts through which Fifth Avenue passes. Buildings in these districts with individual landmark designations are described in . From north to south, the districts are:
* The Carnegie Hill Historic District, a city landmark district, which covers 400 buildings, primarily along Fifth Avenue from 86th to 98th Street, as well as on side streets extending east to Madison, Park, and Lexington Avenues.
* The Metropolitan Museum Historic District, a city landmark district, which consists of properties on Fifth Avenue between 79th and 86th Streets, outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as properties on several side streets.
* The Upper East Side Historic District, a city and NRHP district. The city district runs from 59th to 78th Streets along Fifth Avenue, and up to Third Avenue at some points.
* The Madison Square North Historic District, a city landmark district, which covers 96 buildings from 25th to 29th Streets around Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and side streets.
* The Ladies&#x27; Mile Historic District, a city landmark district, which covers 440 buildings from roughly 15th Street to 24th Street and from Park Avenue South to west of Sixth Avenue.
* The Greenwich Village Historic District, a city landmark district, which covers much of Greenwich Village and includes almost all buildings on Fifth Avenue south of 12th Street.

In the 1980s, there was also a proposal for a historic district on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 58th Streets. At the time, St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, St. Thomas Church, the Cartier Building at number 651, the University Club, the Rizzoli Building at number 712, and the Coty Building at number 714 were official city landmarks. However, other structures on that strip had no protection yet, including Rockefeller Center, the Elizabeth Arden Building at 689 Fifth Avenue, the St. Regis Hotel, the Peninsula Hotel, and the Bergdorf Goodman Building.

=== Other ===
In addition, the cooperative apartment building at 2 Fifth Avenue was named a New York cultural landmark on December 12, 2013, by the Historic Landmark Preservation Center, as the last residence of former New York City Mayor Ed Koch.

==Economy==

Between 49th Street and 60th Street, Fifth Avenue is lined with prestigious boutiques and flagship stores and is consistently ranked the most expensive shopping street in the world.

Many luxury goods, fashion, and sport brand boutiques are located on Fifth Avenue, including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany &amp; Co. (whose flagship is at 57th Street), Gucci, Prada, Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Cartier, Omega, Chanel, Harry Winston, Salvatore Ferragamo, Nike, Escada, Rolex, Bvlgari, Emilio Pucci, Ermenegildo Zegna, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Hollister Co., De Beers, Emanuel Ungaro, Gap, Versace, Lindt Chocolate Shop, Henri Bendel, NBA Store, Oxxford Clothes, Microsoft Store, Sephora, Tourneau, and Wempe. Luxury department stores include Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman. Fifth Avenue also is home to an Apple Store.

Many airlines in the pre-internet era at one time had ticketing offices along Fifth Avenue. With the advent of the internet and online ticketing, these ticketing offices were ultimately replaced by other businesses on Fifth Avenue. Pan American World Airways went out of business, while Air France, Finnair, and KLM moved their ticket offices to other areas in Midtown Manhattan.

<text>Lilly Daché ( 1892 – 31 December 1989) was a French-born American milliner and fashion merchandiser. She started her career in a small bonnet shop, advanced to being a sales lady at Macy&#x27;s department store, and from there started her own hat business. She was at the peak of her business career in the 1930s and 1940s. Her contributions to millinery were well-known custom-designed fashion hats for wealthy women, celebrities, socialites, and movie stars. Her hats cost about ten times the average cost of a lady&#x27;s hat. Her main hat business was in New York City with branches in Paris. Later in her career she expanded her fashion line to include dresses, perfume, and jewelry.

==Biography==

Daché was born in France and immigrated to the United States in 1924, arriving on September 13. She moved to New York City and got a job at the Bonnet Shop. Daché bought out her friend&#x27;s share within a year and owned the entire business.

Daché&#x27;s contributions to millinery were wrapped around turbans, custom-fitted hats, brimmed half hats, hat caps with visors, cone-tipped berets, loose-fitting colored hairnets, and decorative flower-shaped hats. Daché said that glamour made a man ask for the wearer&#x27;s telephone number and it also made a woman ask for the name of the wearer&#x27;s tailor. Her business flourished in spite of the Great Depression and World War II. Her hats cost upwards of $20 to $80 at a time when a decent hat could be bought for just a tenth of that.

Daché worked with Hollywood costume designer Travis Banton to provide hats.

Dache became a celebrity when she was a guest on a 1955 episode of the television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. Panelist Arlene Francis guessed her mystery identity. She is referenced in the song &quot;Tangerine&quot; performed by the Jimmy Dorsey orchestra as the female singer sings in the second course that Tangerine is all they speak of with darkened eyelashes and a fashion hat by Daché.

Daché begain designing swagger hats in 1948. She also designed clothing, cosmetics, jewelry and other accessories. She had business branches for these products in Paris. Some of her custom hats are displayed at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum.

Daché retired in 1968 after selling her last hats to actress Loretta Young. She died on December 31, 1989, in Louveciennes, France.

== Personal life ==
In 1931, Daché married French-born Jean Despres who was an executive at the large cosmetics and fragrance company, Coty. She had a daughter, Suzanne. In her final years, she spent time in Delray Beach, Florida. She also spent time in New York City and Meudon, France.

<doc id="341865" wikidata="Q318144" url="?curid=341865" title="Cycladic culture">
<text>Cycladic culture (also known as Cycladic civilisation) was a Bronze Age culture (c. 3100–c. 1000 BC) found throughout the islands of the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea. In chronological terms, it is a relative dating system for artifacts which is roughly contemporary to Helladic chronology (mainland Greece) and Minoan chronology (Crete) during the same period of time.

==History==

=== Late Neolithic Period ===
The significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic flat female (and, rarely, male) figurines of uncertain purpose carved out of the islands&#x27; pure white marble. It was roughly contemporaneous with the Middle Bronze Age (&quot;Minoan&quot;) culture that arose in Crete, to the south. A distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean in the third millennium BC based on emmer and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Chalandriani, Phylakopi, Skarkos, Saliagos, Amorgos, Naxos and Kephala (on Kea), which showed signs of copper-working. 

=== Early Bronze Age ===
Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c. 3100 and 2300 BC. Excavations at Knossos on Crete reveal an influence of Cycladic civilization upon Knossos in the period 3400 to 2000 BC as evidenced from pottery finds at Knossos.Kea is the location of a Bronze Age settlement at the site now called Ayia Irini, which reached its height in the Late Minoan and Early Mycenaean eras (1600–1400 BC). The Mycenaean town of Naxos (around 1300 BC) covered the area from today&#x27;s city to the islet of &quot;Palatia.&quot; Part of it was discovered under the square in front of the Orthodox Cathedral in Chora, where the archaeological site of Grotta is located today. Naxos has been continuously inhabited since at least the fourth millennium BC. Study of the island&#x27;s toponyms asserts that Naxos has never been abandoned.

=== Middle Bronze Age ===
Cycladic culture in the Middle Bronze age went through some geographical shifts, as archaeologists have found artifacts and communities that point towards an expansion of Cycladic culture&#x27;s influence, including on the mainland and Crete. Walls that appear to date to this period show expansion from older Cycladic walls in many areas. One of the main pieces of evidence we have for this period of Cycladic history is pottery. Likewise, graves serve as a primary source of information for this period. Transitions in pottery styles have helped historians pin down a more accurate date range for the Middle Cycladic period.

=== Late Bronze Age ===
Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that crews of twenty-five oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities. When the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands became relatively less significant. This occurred when Cycladic culture was increasingly submerged in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. Exceptions to this were Kea, Naxos and Delos; the last of these retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary through the period of Classical Greek civilization (see Delian League).

=== Chronology ===
The chronology of Cycladic civilization is divided into three major sequences: Early, Middle and Late Cycladic. The early period, beginning c. 3100 BC, segued into the archaeologically murkier Middle Cycladic c. 2000 BC. By the end of the Late Cycladic sequence (c. 1000 BC), there was essential convergence between the Cycladic and Minoan civilizations.

There is some disagreement between the dating systems used for Cycladic civilization, one &quot;cultural&quot; and one &quot;chronological&quot;. Attempts to link them lead to varying combinations. A prominent scholarly attempt to do this, as proposed by Oliver Dickinson, can be found below:

==Archaeology==

The initial archaeological excavations of the 1880s, undertaken by antiquaries such as Theodore Bent, were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898–99 and coined the term &quot;Cycladic civilization&quot;. Interest then lagged, but picked up in the mid-20th century, partially to collectors taking an interest in owning artifacts from Early Cycladic cemeteries.

=== Pottery ===
Pottery makes up a large part of the artifacts we have, especially in context, from Cycladic culture. Pottery has played a large role in sectioning Cycladic chronology into different periods. This is due to shifts in style and materials over time.

Pottery was also hugely important to Cycladic culture in the context of their maritime activities. Evidence suggests that pottery was a primary good traded to and from the Cyclades via boats, especially during the Early Cycladic period.

=== Evidence of seafaring ===
While there are no discovered surviving boats from this time and place, other types of archaeological finds have helped historians piece together evidence of a rich seafaring practice in Cycladic culture. Discoveries include the Cycladic frying pans, whose original functions remain unknown. Despite the mysteries that come with them, Cycladic frying pans offer insight into Cycladic culture through their imagery. The pan pictured in this section, as well as others that archaeologists have found, depicts a ship, which is indicative of the importance of seafaring to Cycladic peoples. This also gives us a good idea of how Cycladic ships would have been constructed. There were likely two kinds of ships, a small boat meant to be managed by one person or a very small crew, and a longboat that could support a crew of at least twenty five people.


== Artifact looting and forgery ==

Studies of Cycladic culture have faced significant difficulties due to artifact looting. Since the early 1900s, private collectors have coveted Cycladic figures and other artifacts, leading to a huge illicit trade in these items. These figures have typically been stolen from burials to satisfy the Cycladic antiquities market. This really began as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to a sculpture by Jean Arp or Constantin Brâncuși. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these Cycladic figurines has thus been mostly destroyed; their meaning may never be completely understood as a result. It has been suggested that around 90% of the figures we know of were looted or removed from their original locations in a unscientific manner, resulting in the loss of context with which to build a proper historical narrative.

Between 2009 and 2010, scholars were able to meet with a man they simply identified as &quot;the forger&quot;, and obtained inside information about the illicit process of funneling artifacts and forgeries to collectors, as well as how these forgeries were being produced. This has helped archaeologists and scholars to properly identify forgeries with more accuracy, as well as to trace certain artifacts back to their original locations more accurately.

<text>The Norton Simon Museum is an art museum located in Pasadena, California. It was previously known as the Pasadena Art Institute and the Pasadena Art Museum and displays numerous sculptures on its grounds.

== Overview ==
The Norton Simon collections include: European paintings, sculptures, and tapestries; Asian sculptures, paintings, and woodblock prints. Outside sculptures surround the museum, with notable Rodin sculptures near its entrance and other sculptures along Colorado Boulevard and in a landscape setting around a large pond. The museum contains the Norton Simon Theater which shows film programs daily, and hosts lectures, symposia, and dance and musical performances year-round. The museum is located on Colorado Boulevard along the route of the Tournament of Roses&#x27;s Rose Parade, where its distinctive, brown tile exterior can be seen in the background of television broadcasts.

== History ==
After receiving approximately 400 German Expressionist pieces from collector Galka Scheyer in 1953, the Pasadena Art Institute changed its name to the Pasadena Art Museum in 1954 and occupied the Chinoiserie-style &quot;The Grace Nicholson Treasure House of Oriental Art&quot; building (now the Pacific Asia Museum) on North Los Robles Avenue until 1970. The museum filled a void, being the only modern art museum between San Francisco and La Jolla in California at the time. It was known for progressive art exhibits and supported the work of local contemporary artists such as Helen Lundeberg, John McLaughlin, and Sam Francis. In 1962, curator Walter Hopps arrived from the Ferus gallery, organizing an early Pop art show in 1962 and a Marcel Duchamp retrospective in 1963, as well as solo shows of the work of Kurt Schwitters and Joseph Cornell.

Hopps later drew up a short list of California architects for a new museum building, including Richard Neutra, Charles Eames, John Lautner, Craig Ellwood, and Thornton Ladd. Hopps insisted on a local architect because he expected a high level of interaction throughout the design process. A new Pasadena Art Museum building was completed in 1969, designed by Pasadena architects Thornton Ladd and John Kelsey of the firm Ladd &amp; Kelsey. The general contractor selected to build the museum was Del E. Webb Corporation. The distinctive and modern curvilinear exterior facade is faced in 115,000 glazed tiles, in varying rich brown tones with an undulating surface, made by ceramic artisan Edith Heath. Hopps resigned before the museum opened.

In the early 1970s, due to an ambitious schedule of exhibits and the new building project, the museum began to experience serious financial hardships. By that time, industrialist Norton Simon, who had risen to become one of the pre-eminent art collectors in the world during the 1960s, was searching for a permanent location for his growing collection of over 4,000 objects. He was first approached for financial assistance in 1971 by trustees of the museum. In 1974, the museum and Simon came to an agreement. According to the agreed five-year plan, Simon took over an $850,000 loan on the building and other financial obligations, including a $1 million accumulated operating deficit, in return for using 75% of the gallery space for his collection. The remainder was used to display the Pasadena museum&#x27;s contemporary collection. A new 10-member board of trustees was formed, consisting of four members from Simon&#x27;s group, three from the Pasadena museum board and three public members nominated by Simon. Simon also became responsible for the collection and building projects; in return the museum was renamed the Norton Simon Museum and renovated at a reported cost of more than $3 million. The detailed history of that process was told by former director and art critic John Coplans (who later became an artist) in &quot;Artforum&quot;. This move, widely criticized by the local community as it represented the closing of the only contemporary art museum between San Francisco and La Jolla, led indirectly to the founding of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 1979, a project largely driven by Norton Simon&#x27;s sister Marcia Weisman.

Simon died in 1993, and the actress Jennifer Jones, his widow and chairwoman of the board, made corrective, conciliatory moves that have repositioned the museum and its two collections. In 1995, the museum began a major $5 million renovation with the architect Frank Gehry, a longtime trustee of the museum. The redesign resulted in a procession of medium-size, more intimate galleries with raised ceilings and improved lighting, increased rotating exhibition space, an entire floor devoted to Asian art, and restored access to the gardens. The gardens, which are located on the old &quot;Carmelita&quot; property, were redesigned by Power and Associates to house the 20th-century sculpture collection in an engaging setting. The new Norton Simon Theater was the final element of the renovation, designed by Gensler &amp; Associates, and is used for lectures, film, dance performances and concerts.

== Collections ==
The Norton Simon Museum, which comprises more than 11,000 objects, contains a significant permanent collection which is highly regarded internationally. The museum itself does not own the works it displays; instead, most of the art is on long-term loan from The Norton Simon Foundation and the Norton Simon Art Foundation, which each own different groups of artworks. As of 2014, their public filings placed the combined fair-market value of the artworks at about $5 billion. The museum makes relatively little effort to expand the collection amassed by its founder, but it still receives gifts. However, no more than 800 or 900 of those pieces are on display at any one time. The museum also mounts temporary exhibitions that focus on a particular artist, an art movement or artistic period, or art that was created in a specific region or country.

For more than three decades after it was founded in 1975, the Norton Simon Museum maintained a no-loans policy. In 2007, the board agreed to circulate select works to museums including the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., saying it wanted the museum to become better known. In 2009, it entered into a reciprocal loan agreement with the Frick Collection in New York City.

=== Asian art ===

The museum has a collection of art from South Asia and Southeast Asia, with examples of this region&#x27;s sculptural and painting traditions. On display are holdings from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Tibet, Cambodia and Thailand, as well as selected works from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Japan. The collection is particularly rich in art from the Indian subcontinent, including monumental stone sculpture from the Kushana and Gupta periods, and a remarkable group of Chola bronzes from southern India. Selections of the museum&#x27;s Rajput paintings from India, and thangkas, or Buddhist religious paintings, from Tibet and Nepal are well represented. The significant collection of Japanese woodblock prints includes objects that were formerly in the collection of Frank Lloyd Wright.
=== European art: 14th–16th centuries ===
Masterworks of the Early Renaissance, the High Renaissance and Mannerism make up the museum&#x27;s extensive collection of 14th- to 16th-century European art. Exquisite works by Paolo Veneziano and Giovanni di Paolo, and an exceptional Guariento di Arpo altarpiece, anchor the museum&#x27;s collection of gold-ground panel paintings. Jacopo Bassano, Botticelli, Filippino Lippi and Raphael are represented by rich oil paintings of religious scenes. Also represented are magnificent examples of such Northern European masters as Lucas Cranach the Elder, Dieric Bouts and Hans Memling. The portraits of Giorgione, Giovanni Bellini and El Greco reflect the great diversity of subject matter in the collection. Ownership of Cranach&#x27;s &quot;Adam&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot; is disputed due to their history as Nazi loot.

=== European art: 17th–18th centuries ===

The museum&#x27;s early Baroque paintings from Italy and Spain are represented by such noted artists as Guido Reni, Guercino, Murillo and Zurbarán. The Northern Baroque collection is profoundly expressed in the works of Peter Paul Rubens. The remarkable group of 17th-century Dutch genre, portrait and landscape paintings is crowned with three portraits by Rembrandt. Capping off the 17th century are Flemish and German still lifes, and religious landscapes by the French masters Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. The French component of the 18th century collection contains paintings by Watteau, Fragonard and Boucher, while Italy is represented with capriccios and historic glimpses into the daily life of Rome and Venice with works by Longhi, Pannini, Guardi, Canaletto, and Tiepolo.

=== European art: 19th century ===

The museum&#x27;s paintings by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Francisco de Goya mark the beginning of the 19th century and lead to superb examples of mid-century Realism executed by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet. The museum has the most significant collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art in Southern California. Works by Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Edgar Degas, who alone is represented by over one hundred works of art, are displayed alongside works by Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin. Complementing these works are Auguste Rodin&#x27;s monumental bronze sculptures, displayed in the museum&#x27;s front garden. Outstanding paintings by Édouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard lead to the doorstep of 20th-century Modernism.

=== Modern art ===
The museum has an extensive collection of Modern art, with seminal works by Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, and Diego Rivera on permanent view. The &quot;Galka Scheyer collection of works by the Blue Four artists&quot; boasts paintings and works on paper by Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger, Alexei Jawlensky, and Wassily Kandinsky. Scheyer, a German art dealer and collector who had represented these artists and settled in L.A. in 1925, left 450 works by the Blue Four and other modern artists (plus an archive of 800 documents) to the Pasadena Art Institute after plans had failed to give them to UCLA.

=== Contemporary art ===
The collection of Post-War Contemporary Art, from the Norton Simon Museum&#x27;s acquisition of the Pasadena Art Museum&#x27;s building and collections, is noteworthy for its strength in collage, assemblage and sculpture, including works by Joseph Cornell, Robert Rauschenberg, Louise Nevelson, and Ed Kienholz. Pop Art, and Minimal Art are represented by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Donald Judd, and Robert Irwin. Californian art from the 1950s through the 1970s is a particular strength, with artwork by Sam Francis, Richard Diebenkorn, Jay DeFeo, Ronald Davis, Larry Bell, Edward Ruscha, Kenneth Price, Charles Arnoldi, and Ed Moses, Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction are represented by Kenneth Noland, Ronnie Landfield, Frank Stella, Helen Frankenthaler, and Kenneth Showell.

=== Sculpture ===
Major sculptors of the 19th century and early 20th century, including Aristide Maillol, Constantin Brâncuși, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, and Isamu Noguchi, are represented by works in bronze, lead and marble sculptures throughout the galleries and outside the museum, including the Front Garden and Colorado Boulevard lawn, as well as the extensive Sculpture Garden grounds.

== Management ==
The Norton Simon is organized as an operating foundation, devoting its resources to its own public benefit activities. The operating budget is about $6 million. The museum building, which is owned by the board of trustees, stands on land leased from the City of Pasadena for $1 a year. The 75-year lease runs until 2050. Negotiations in the past included possible moves to San Francisco and UCLA, as well as an affiliation with the J. Paul Getty Trust.

Jennifer Jones&#x27; Hollywood connections brought members of the film and television community, including Billy Wilder, Gregory Peck, Cary Grant, David Geffen, Tom Brokaw, and Candice Bergen, to the Norton Simon&#x27;s museum board.

== Art repatriation issues ==
In 2012, the Cambodian government asked the United States to help it recover a 10th-century Khmer sandstone statue from the Norton Simon Museum, saying the work was looted from a Cambodian temple complex during the country&#x27;s political upheavals in the 1970s. The sculpture in question was owned by the Norton Simon Art Foundation and has been on display since 1980, and although Cambodian authorities have long known it was there, they had not sought its return until recently. In the spring of 2014, the Norton Simon returned the sculpture to the Kingdom of Cambodia.

From 2007 until 2018, the museum was embroiled in a legal dispute over rightful ownership of Lucas Cranach the Elder&#x27;s 1530 paired paintings &quot;Adam&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot;. Marei van Saher filed suit, seeking the return of the paintings and alleging that they were confiscated by the Nazi&#x27;s from her father-in-law, Jacques Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch Jewish art dealer. Goudstikker died on board a ship with his family while attempting to flee the Netherlands. After the war, the paintings were recovered by the Monuments Men and returned to the Dutch government. In the 1960s, the Dutch government transferred them to United States Naval Commander George Stroganoff-Scherbatoff, who claimed they had previously been stolen from his family in Russia by the Stalinist government and sold to Goudstikker in a widely criticized estate auction in Berlin. The paintings were sold in the early 1970s by the Commander to Norton Simon and his foundations, and they have been on display in the Norton Simon Museum of Art for more than 30 years. Despite ethical concerns expressed by many, including the grandson of founder Norton Simon, the Norton Simon Museum continued its legal battle to keep the works. The Norton Simon Museum&#x27;s defense hinges on a legal sale by the Dutch government to Commander Stroganoff-Scherbatoff after the owner&#x27;s widow declined a settlement with the government in 1966. During the case in 2012, the court heard that &quot;The Dutch government itself undermined the legitimacy of [the] restitution process by describing it as &#x27;bureaucratic, cold and often even callous.&quot; The museum sought U.S. Supreme Court review of a June 2014 ruling delivered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that allowed von Saher to continue her claim; the Supreme Court had declined to hear a prior stage of the case in 2010. In 2017, the court ruled 3–0 against von Saher.

<text>John Frum (also called Jon Frum, John Brum, and John Prum) is a figure associated with cargo cults on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides). He is often depicted as an American World War II serviceman who liberates the Vanuatu from American imperialism, bringing wealth, prosperity, and self-determination to the people if they follow him. 

In the 1990s, there were still reportedly over 5,000 members of the John Frum movement. Belief in John Frum is in decline, however; as of 2022, there are fewer than 500 practitioners. Currently, only the village of Lamakara is faithful to the John Frum faith on the island of Tanna. The rest of the island has been mostly converted by Christian missionaries based in Sulphur Bay.

==History==

The religion centering on John Frum arose no later than the late 1930s, when Vanuatu was known as the New Hebrides. The religion may have originated as early as the 1910s, according to a claim in 1949. The movement was influenced by existing religious practice in the Sulphur Bay area of Tanna, particularly the worship of Keraperamun, a god associated with Mount Tukosmera.

In one analysis of the cult, the figure was first known as John Broom, who was believed by followers to one day return from a distant land to sweep away the White colonials and return riches to the islands. In some versions of the story, a native man named Manehivi, using the alias &quot;John Frum&quot;, began appearing among the native people of Tanna dressed in a Western-style coat, assuring the people he would bring them houses, clothes, food, and transport.

Others contend that John Frum was a spirit vision induced by kava, a plant with mild psychoactive properties. Said to be a manifestation of Keraperamun, this John Frum promised the dawn of a new age in which all White people, including missionaries, would depart the New Hebrides, leaving behind their goods and property for the native Melanesians. For this to happen, however, the people of Tanna had to reject all aspects of European society including money, Western education, Christianity and work on copra plantations, and they had to return to traditional &quot;kastom&quot; (the Bislama language word for &quot;customs&quot;).

In 1941, followers of John Frum rid themselves of their money in a frenzy of spending, left the missionary churches, schools, villages and plantations, and moved inland to participate in traditional feasts, dances and rituals. Most followers had come from the Presbyterian church. European colonial authorities sought to suppress the movement, at one point arresting a Tannese man calling himself John Frum, humiliating him publicly, imprisoning and ultimately exiling him along with other leaders of the cult to another island in the archipelago.

Despite this effort, the movement gained popularity in the early 1940s after 50,000 American troops were stationed in Vanuatu during World War II, bringing with them an enormous amount of supplies (or &quot;cargo&quot;). During the war, approximately 10,000 Ni-Vanuatu men served in the Vanuatu Labor Corps, a labor battalion of the United States Armed Forces. They provided logistical support to the Allied war effort during the Guadalcanal Campaign. The mass participation of Ni-Vanuatu men in the Labor Corps had a significant effect on the John Frum movement, giving it the characteristics of a cargo cult.

After the war and the departure of the Americans, followers of John Frum built symbolic landing strips to encourage American airplanes to land and bring them &quot;cargo&quot;. Versions of the cult emphasizing the American connection interpret &quot;John Frum&quot; as a corruption of &quot;John from (America)&quot; (although it could mean &quot;John from&quot; anywhere not of Vanuatan origin).

In 1957, a leader of the John Frum movement, Nakomaha, created the &quot;Tanna Army&quot;, a non-violent ritualistic society that organised military-style parades of men with faces painted in ritual colours and wearing white T-shirts with the letters &quot;T-A USA&quot; (Tanna Army USA). This parade takes place every year on February 15, the date on which followers believe John Frum will return, and which is observed as &quot;John Frum Day&quot; in Vanuatu.

In a 1960 BBC documentary, British broadcaster David Attenborough asked the locals what Frum looked like and was told E look like you. &#x27;E got white face. &#x27;E tall man. &#x27;E live &#x27;long South America.&quot;

In the late 1970s, John Frum followers opposed the imminent creation of an independent united nation of Vanuatu. They objected to a centralised government they feared would favor Western modernity and Christianity that would be detrimental to local customs. The John Frum movement has its own political party, Nagriamel, led by Song Keaspai. The party celebrated its 50th anniversary on February 15, 2007. Chief Isaak Wan Nikiau, its leader, was quoted by the BBC from years past as saying that John Frum was &quot;our God, our Jesus&quot; and would eventually return.

In December 2011, the president of the John Frum movement (and jointly of Nagriamel) was Thitam Goiset, a woman of Vietnamese origin and sister of businessman Dinh Van Than, despite the leadership of these movements having been &quot;previously [...] held by high ranking male chiefs&quot;. In 2013, Thitam Goiset was removed from her role as Vanuatu&#x27;s ambassador to Russia amid evidence of corrupt activities.

Followers of the movement continue to celebrate John Frum Day each year in February. Europeans who have made claims of being the leader mentioned in the prophecy—such as Claude-Philippe Berger ( July 2021), who styled himself the &quot;traditional king of Tanna&quot;—have gained status in Vanuatuan communities by promising to bring development and investment to the communities.

<text>Armley is an unincorporated community in the Rural Municipality of Connaught No. 457, Saskatchewan, Canada. Approximately halfway between Tisdale and Nipawin, northwest of the intersection of Highway 35 and Highway 335. Armley was the site of the Humboldt Broncos bus crash, killing 16 hockey players and personnel from a team in the city of Humboldt.

== History ==
Coming into existence in the early 1900s as the farming region was settled, Armley reached its peak during the 1920s with the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1924.

With the decline in the rural population of Saskatchewan and the consolidation of businesses and services in larger centres, the townsite now only contains a local community hall and a handful of houses. The former general store, church, post office, hotel and grain elevators are no longer in operation.

<doc id="341876" wikidata="Q4627" url="?curid=341876" title="Aymara language">
<text>Aymara (; also ) is an Aymaran language spoken by the Aymara people of the Bolivian Andes. It is one of only a handful of Native American languages with over one million speakers. Aymara, along with Spanish and Quechua, is an official language in Bolivia and Peru. It is also spoken, to a much lesser extent, by some communities in northern Chile, where it is a recognized minority language.

Some linguists have claimed that Aymara is related to its more widely spoken neighbor, Quechua. That claim, however, is disputed. Although there are indeed similarities, like the nearly identical phonologies, the majority position among linguists today is that the similarities are better explained as areal features arising from prolonged cohabitation, rather than natural genealogical changes that would stem from a common protolanguage.

Aymara is an agglutinating and, to a certain extent, a polysynthetic language. It has a subject–object–verb word order. It is based on a three-valued logic system. Aymara is normally written using the Latin alphabet.

== Etymology ==
The ethnonym &quot;Aymara&quot; may be ultimately derived from the name of some group occupying the southern part of what is now the Quechua speaking area of Apurímac. Regardless, the use of the word &quot;Aymara&quot; as a label for this people was standard practice as early as 1567, as evident from Garci Diez de San Miguel&#x27;s report of his inspection of the province of Chucuito (1567, 14; cited in Lafaye 1964). In this document, he uses the term &quot;aymaraes&quot; to refer to the people. The language was then called Colla. It is believed that Colla was the name of an Aymara nation at the time of conquest, and later was the southernmost region of the Inca empire Collasuyu. However, Cerrón Palomino disputes this claim and asserts that Colla were in fact Puquina speakers who were the rulers of Tiwanaku in the first and third centuries (2008:246). This hypothesis suggests that the linguistically-diverse area ruled by the Puquina came to adopt Aymara languages in their southern region.

In any case, the use of &quot;Aymara&quot; to refer to the language may have first occurred in the works of the lawyer, magistrate and tax collector in Potosí and Cusco, Polo de Ondegardo. This man, who later assisted Viceroy Toledo in creating a system under which the indigenous population would be ruled for the next 200 years, wrote a report in 1559 entitled &#x27;On the lineage of the Yncas and how they extended their conquests&#x27; in which he discusses land and taxation issues of the Aymara under the Inca empire.

More than a century passed before &quot;Aymara&quot; entered general usage to refer to the language spoken by the Aymara people (Briggs, 1976:14). In the meantime the Aymara language was referred to as &quot;the language of the Colla&quot;. The best account of the history of Aymara is that of Cerrón-Palomino, who shows that the ethnonym Aymara, which came from the glottonym, is likely derived from the Quechuaized toponym &quot;ayma-ra-y&quot; &#x27;place of communal property&#x27;. The entire history of this term is thoroughly outlined in his book, &quot;Voces del Ande&quot; (2008:19–32) and &quot;Lingüística Aimara&quot;.

The suggestion that &quot;Aymara&quot; comes from the Aymara words &quot;&quot;jaya&quot; (ancient) and &quot;mara&quot;&quot; (year, time) is almost certainly a mistaken folk etymology.

== Classification ==
It is often assumed that the Aymara language descends from the language spoken in Tiwanaku on the grounds that it is the native language of that area today. That is very far from certain, however, and most specialists now incline to the idea that Aymara did not expand into the Tiwanaku area until rather recently, as it spread southwards from an original homeland that was more likely to have been in Central Peru. Aymara placenames are found all the way north into central Peru. Indeed, (Altiplano) Aymara is actually the one of two extant members of a wider language family, the other surviving representative being Jaqaru.

The family was established by the research of Lucy Briggs (a fluent speaker) and Martha Hardman de Bautista of the Program in Linguistics at the University of Florida. Jaqaru [&quot;jaqi aru&quot; = human language] and Kawki communities are in the district of Tupe, Yauyos Valley, in the Dept. of Lima, in central Peru. Terminology for this wider language family is not yet well established. Hardman has proposed the name &#x27;Jaqi&#x27; (&#x27;human&#x27;) while other widely respected Peruvian linguists have proposed alternative names for the same language family. Alfredo Torero uses the term &#x27;Aru&#x27; (&#x27;speech&#x27;); Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino, meanwhile, has proposed that the term &#x27;Aymara&#x27; should be used for the whole family, distinguished into two branches, Southern (or Altiplano) Aymara and Central Aymara (Jaqaru and Kawki). Each of these three proposals has its followers in Andean linguistics. In English usage, some linguists use the term Aymaran languages for the family and reserve &#x27;Aymara&#x27; for the Altiplano branch.

== Dialects ==
There is some degree of regional variation within Aymara, but all dialects are mutually intelligible.

Most studies of the language focused on either the Aymara spoken on the southern Peruvian shore of Lake Titicaca or the Aymara spoken around La Paz. Lucy Therina Briggs classifies both regions as being part of the Northern Aymara dialect, which encompasses the department of La Paz in Bolivia and the department of Puno in Peru. The Southern Aymara dialect is spoken in the eastern half of the Tarapacá Region in northern Chile and in most of the Bolivian department of Oruro. It is also found in northern Potosi and southwest Cochabamba but is slowly being replaced by Quechua in those regions.

Intermediate Aymara shares dialectical features with both Northern and Southern Aymara and is found in the eastern half of the Tacna and Moquegua departments in southern Peru and in the northeastern tip of Chile.

== Geographical distribution ==
There are roughly two million Bolivian speakers, half a million Peruvian speakers, and perhaps a few thousand speakers in Chile. At the time of the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century, Aymara was the dominant language over a much larger area than today, including most of highland Peru south of Cusco. Over the centuries, Aymara has gradually lost speakers both to Spanish and to Quechua; many Peruvian and Bolivian communities that were once Aymara-speaking now speak Quechua.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Aymara has three phonemic vowel qualities , which, in most varieties of the language, occur as either long or short (i.e. ). Long vowels are indicated in the spelling with a diaeresis in writing: &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ï&quot;, &quot;ü&quot;. The high vowels /i u/ occur as mid-high [e o] when near uvular consonants /q qʰ qʼ χ/. The three vowel sounds are heard as [ə, ɪ, ʊ] when in unstressed positions.

Vowel deletion is frequent in Aymara. Vowel deletion typically occurs due to one of three factors: (i) phonotactic, (ii) syntactic, and (iii) morphophonemic.

* Phonotactic vowel deletion takes the shape of hiatus reduction when two vowels co-occur through word construction or through suffixation. In such environments, one vowel deletes. (i) if one of the two vowels is , the other vowels assimilate to it, (ii) if the vowels are and , /a/ assimilates. (iii) If the sequence is composed of two identical vowels, one will delete.
* Vowel elision can be syntactically conditioned. For example, in nominal compounds and noun phrases, all adjectival/nominal modifiers with three or more vowels in a modifier + nucleus NP lose their final vowel.
* Morphemic vowel deletion is the most common. Some suffixes never co-occur with the preceding vowel in the root, whereas others lose their own vowel in certain environments. Patterns of morphophonological vowel deletion derive from historical changes that affected individual suffixes differently, so that no clear patterns emerge.

=== Consonants ===
Aymara has phonemic stops at the labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular points of articulation. Stops show no distinction of voice (e.g. there is no phonemic contrast between and ), but each stop occurs in three laryngeal settings: plain or voiceless unaspirated (aka tenuis), glottalized, and aspirated. Sounds such as [] occur as allophones of //. Aymara also has a tapped , and an alveolar/palatal contrast for nasals and laterals, as well as two semivowels ( and ).

Orthographic representation is the same as the IPA where not shown.

=== Stress ===
Stress is usually on the second-to-last syllable, but long vowels may shift it. Although the final vowel of a word is elided except at the end of a phrase, the stress remains unchanged.

=== Syllable structure ===
The vast majority of roots are disyllabic and, with few exceptions, suffixes are monosyllabic. Roots conform to the template (C)V(C)CV, with CVCV being predominant. The majority of suffixes are CV, though there are some exceptions: CVCV, CCV, CCVCV and even VCV are possible but rare.

The agglutinative nature of this predominantly suffixing language, coupled with morphophonological alternations caused by vowel deletion and phonologically conditioned constraints, gives rise to interesting surface structures that operate in the domain of the morpheme, syllable, and phonological word/phrase. The phonological/morphophonological processes observed include syllabic reduction, epenthesis, deletion, and reduplication.

== Orthography ==

Beginning with Spanish missionary efforts, there have been many attempts to create a writing system for Aymara. The colonial sources employed a variety of writing systems heavily influenced by Spanish, the most widespread one being that of Bertonio. Many of the early grammars employed unique alphabets as well as the one of Middendorf&#x27;s &quot;Aymara-Sprache&quot; (1891).

The first official alphabet to be adopted for Aymara was the Scientific Alphabet. It was approved by the &quot;III Congreso Indigenista Interamericano de la Paz&quot; in 1954, though its origins can be traced as far back as 1931. Rs. No 1593 (Deza Galindo 1989, 17). It was the first official record of an alphabet, but in 1914, Sisko Chukiwanka Ayulo and Julián Palacios Ríos had recorded what may be the first of many attempts to have one alphabet for both Quechua and Aymara, the &quot;Syentifiko Qheshwa-Aymara Alfabeto&quot; with 37 graphemes.

Several other attempts followed, with varying degrees of success. Some orthographic attempts even expand further: the &quot;Alfabeto Funcional Trilingüe&quot;, made up of 40 letters (including the voiced stops necessary for Spanish) and created by the Academia de las Lenguas Aymara y Quechua in Puno in 1944 is the one used by the lexicographer Juan Francisco Deza Galindo in his &quot;Diccionario Aymara – Castellano / Castellano – Aymara&quot;. This alphabet has five vowels ⟨a, e, i, o, u⟩, aspiration is conveyed with an ⟨h⟩ next to the consonant, and ejectives with ⟨&#x27;⟩. The most unusual characteristic is the expression of the uvular /χ/ with ⟨jh⟩. The other uvular segment, /q/, is expressed by ⟨q⟩, but transcription rules mandate that the following vowel must be ⟨a, e, o⟩ (not ⟨i, u⟩), presumably to account for uvular lowering and to facilitate multilingual orthography.

The alphabet created by the Comisión de Alfabetización y Literatura Aymara (CALA) was officially recognized in Bolivia in 1968 (co-existing with the 1954 Scientific Alphabet). Besides being the alphabet employed by Protestant missionaries, it is also the one used for the translation of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;. Also in 1968, de Dios Yapita created his take on the Aymara alphabet at the Instituto de Lenga y Cultura Aymara (ILCA).

Nearly 15 years later, the &quot;Servicio Nacional de Alfabetización y Educación Popular&quot; (SENALEP) attempted to consolidate these alphabets to create a system which could be used to write both Aymara and Quechua, creating what was known as the Alfabeto Unificado. The alphabet, later sanctioned in Bolivia by Decree 20227 on 9 May 1984 and in Peru as la Resolución Ministerial Peruana 1218ED on 18 November 1985, consists of 3 vowels, 26 consonants and an umlaut to mark vowel length. The orthography was shown in the phonological table in the previous section, and is the same where angle brackets are not shown.

In 2015 a full writing system was developed for Aymara using the Korean script Hangeul.

== Morphology ==
Aymara is a highly agglutinative, predominantly suffixing language. All suffixes can be categorized into the nominal, verbal, transpositional and those not subcategorized for lexical category (including stem-external word-level suffixes and phrase-final suffixes), as below:

* Nominal and verbal morphology is characterized by derivational- and inflectional-like suffixes as well as non-productive suffixes.
* Transpositional morphology consists of verbalizers (that operate on the root or phrasal levels) and nominalizers (including an action nominalizer, an agentive, and a resultative).
* Suffixes not subcategorized for lexical category can be divided into three stem-external, word-level suffixes (otherwise known as &quot;independent suffixes&quot;) and around a dozen phrase-final suffixes (otherwise known as &quot;sentence suffixes&quot;).

=== Nominal suffixes ===
* Non-productive nominal suffixes vary considerably by variant but typically include those below. Some varieties additionally also have (1) the suffix -&quot;wurasa&quot; (&lt; Spanish &#x27;horas&#x27;), which expresses &#x27;when&#x27; on &quot;aka&quot; &#x27;this&#x27;, &quot;uka&quot; &#x27;that&#x27; and &quot;kuna&quot; &#x27;what&#x27;; (2) temporal suffixes -&quot;unt&quot; ~ -&quot;umt&quot;; and (3) -&quot;kucha&quot;, which attaches to only two roots, &quot;jani&quot; &#x27;no&#x27; and &quot;jicha&quot; &#x27;now&#x27;:
** kinship suffixes, including -&quot;la&quot;, -&quot;lla&quot;, -&quot;chi&quot;, and/or -&quot;ta&quot;
** the expression of size with -&quot;chʼa&quot;
** the suffix -&quot;sa&quot; &#x27;side&#x27;, which attaches to only the demonstratives and &quot;kawki&quot; &#x27;where&#x27;
* Nominal derivational-like suffixes:
** diminutive suffixes
** delimitative suffix -&quot;chapi&quot;
* Nominal inflectional-like suffixes:
** Attributive suffix -&quot;ni&quot;
** Possessive paradigm
** Plural -&quot;naka&quot;
** Reciprocal/inclusor -&quot;pacha&quot;
** Case suffixes – Syntactic relations are generally case-marked, with the exception of the unmarked subject. Case is affixed to the last element of a noun phrase, usually corresponding to the head. Most varieties of Aymara have 14 cases (though in many, the genitive and locative have merged into a single form): ablative -&quot;ta&quot;, accusative (indicated by vowel suppression), allative -&quot;ru&quot;, benefactive -&quot;taki&quot;, comparative -&quot;jama&quot;, genitive -&quot;na&quot;, instrumental/comitative -&quot;mpi&quot;, interactive -&quot;pura&quot;, locative -&quot;na&quot;, limitative -&quot;kama&quot;, nominative (zero), perlative -&quot;kata&quot;, purposive -&quot;layku&quot;.

=== Verbal suffixes ===
All verbs require at least one suffix to be grammatical.

* Verbal derivational-like suffixes
** Direction of motion — Although these suffixes are quite productive, they are not obligatory. The meaning of a word which is affixed with a member of this category is often but not always predictable, and the word formed may have a different meaning than the root.
** Spatial location — The nine spatial locations suffixes are likewise highly productive and not obligatory. Similarly, the meaning of the word that contains a member of this category is typically (but not consistently) predictable. There are also contexts in which the word formed has a meaning that significantly differs from that of the root to which it attaches.
** Valency-increasing — The five valency increasing suffixes may occur on a wide range of verbs but are not obligatory. The meaning expressed when a word receives one of these suffixes is predictable.
** Multipliers/reversers — The two multipliers/reversers are comparatively less productive and are not obligatory. In some contexts, attachment to a verb conveys a reverser meaning and effectively express the opposite of the meaning of the plain root. In this respect, the multipliers/reversers are the most derivational-like of all the suffixes discussed so far.
** Aspect — This category is complicated insofar as it is made up of a diverse array of suffix types, some of which are more productive and/or obligatory than others.
** Others — In some varieties of Aymara, there are three suffixes not classified into the categories above: the verbal comparative -&quot;jama&quot;, the category buffer -&quot;(w)jwa&quot;, and the intensifier -&quot;paya&quot;. Semantically, these three suffixes do not have much in common. They also vary with respect to the degree which they may be classified as more derivational-like or more inflectional-like.
* Verbal inflectional-like suffixes:
** Person/tense — Person and tense are fused into a unitary suffix. These forms are among the most inflectional-like of the verbal suffixes insofar as they are all obligatory and productive. The so-called personal-knowledge tenses include the simple (non-past) and the proximal past. The non-personal knowledge tenses includes the future and distal past.
** Number — The plural verbal suffix, -&quot;pha&quot; (just as the nominal one,-&quot;naka&quot;) is optional. Thus, while pluralization is very productive, it is not obligatory.
** Mood and modality — Mood and modality includes mood, evidentials, event modality, and the imperative. These suffixes are both productive and obligatory. Their semantic affect is usually transparent.

=== Transpositional suffixes ===

A given word can take several transpositional suffixes:
* Verbalizers: There are six suffixes whose primary function is to verbalize nominal roots (not including the reflexive -&quot;si&quot; and the propagative -&quot;tata&quot;). These forms can be subdivided into two groups, (1) phrase verbalizers and (2) root verbalizers.
* Nominalizers: There are three suffixes are used to derive nouns: the agentive -&quot;iri&quot;, the resultative -&quot;ta&quot;, and the action nominalizer (sometimes glossed as the &quot;infinitive&quot; in some descriptions) -&quot;ña&quot;.

=== Suffixes not subcategorized for lexical categories ===

There are two kinds of suffixes not subcategorized for lexical categories:
* Stem external word-final suffixes (sometimes known as &quot;independent suffixes&quot;) — There are three suffixes that are not classifiable as members of either nominal or verbal morphology and are not phrase-final suffixes: the emphatic -&quot;puni&quot;, the delimitative -&quot;ki&quot;, and the additive -&quot;raki&quot;
* Phrase-final suffixes (sometimes known as &quot;sentence suffixes&quot; in the literature) — Most Aymara phrases have at least one of the eleven (depending on variant) possible phrase-final suffixes to be grammatical. The phrase-final suffix must appear minimally on a noun, noun phrase, verb, or verb phrase (note that two phrase-final suffixes, the additive -&quot;sa&quot; and the confirmatory -&quot;pi&quot; appear exclusively on nouns but otherwise pattern with phrase-final suffixes and so may not be best treated with nominal morphology). Exceptions to the requirement that a phrase has at least one phrase-final suffix are mainly limited to imperative constructions.

== Idiosyncrasies ==

Linguistic and gestural analysis by Núñez and Sweetser also asserts that the Aymara have an apparently unique (or at least very rare) understanding of time. Aymara is, with Quechua, one of very few [Núñez &amp; Sweetser, 2006, p. 403] languages in which speakers seem to represent the past as in front of them and the future as behind them. Their argument is mainly within the framework of conceptual metaphor, which recognizes in general two subtypes of the metaphor &quot;the passage of time is motion:&quot; one is &quot;time passing is motion over a landscape&quot; (or &quot;moving-ego&quot;), and the other is &quot;time passing is a moving object&quot; (&quot;moving-events&quot;). The latter metaphor does not explicitly involve the individual/speaker. Events are in a queue, with prior events towards the front of the line. The individual may be facing the queue, or it may be moving from left to right in front of him/her.

The claims regarding Aymara involve the moving-ego metaphor. Most languages conceptualize the ego as moving forward into the future, with ego&#x27;s back to the past. The English sentences &quot;prepare for what lies before us&quot; and &quot;we are facing a prosperous future&quot; exemplify the metaphor. In contrast, Aymara seems to encode the past as in front of individuals and the future behind them. That is typologically a rare phenomenon [Núñez &amp; Sweetser, 2006, p. 416].

The fact that English has words like &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; that are (currently or archaically) polysemous between &#x27;front/earlier&#x27; or &#x27;back/later&#x27; may seem to refute the claims regarding Aymara uniqueness. However, those words relate events to other events and are part of the moving-events metaphor. In fact, when &quot;before&quot; means &quot;in front of ego, it can mean only &quot;future&quot;. For instance, &quot;our future is laid out before us while &quot;our past is behind us&quot;. Parallel Aymara examples describe future days as &quot;qhipa uru&quot;, literally &#x27;back days&#x27;, and they are sometimes accompanied by gestures to behind the speaker. The same applies to Quechua-speakers, whose expression &quot;qhipa pʼunchaw&quot; corresponds directly to Aymara &quot;qhipa uru&quot;. Possibly, the metaphor is from the fact that the past is visible (in front of one&#x27;s eyes), but the future is not.

== Pedagogy ==
There is increasing use of Aymara locally and there are increased numbers learning the language, both Bolivian and abroad. In Bolivia and Peru, intercultural bilingual education programs with Aymara and Spanish have been introduced in the last two decades. There are even projects to offer Aymara through the internet, such as by ILCA.

<text>Silvana Mangano (; 21 April 1930 – 16 December 1989) was an Italian film actress. She was one of a generation of thespians who arose from the neorealist movement, and went on to become a major female star, regarded as a sex symbol for the 1950s and &#x27;60s. She won the David di Donatello for Best Actress three times – for &quot;The Verona Trial&quot; (1963), &quot;The Witches&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Scientific Cardplayer&quot; (1972) – and the Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Actress twice.

Raised in poverty during World War II, Mangano trained as a dancer and worked as a model before winning a Miss Rome beauty pageant in 1946. This led to work in films; she achieved success in &quot;Bitter Rice&quot; (1949) and went on to forge a successful career in films, working with many notable directors like Pier Paolo Pasolini, Luchino Visconti, Alberto Lattuada, and Vittorio De Sica. Her career continued well into her 50s, with supporting roles in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) and Nikita Mikhalkov &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; (1987).

Mangano was the wife of international film producer Dino De Laurentiis and had four children with him, including Veronica De Laurentiis and Raffaella De Laurentiis.

==Early life==
Born in Rome to an Italian father and an English mother (Ivy Webb from Croydon), Mangano lived in poverty during World War II. Trained for seven years as a dancer, she supported herself as a model. In 1946, at age 16, Mangano won the Miss Rome beauty pageant, and through this, she obtained a role in a Mario Costa film. One year later, she became a contestant in the Miss Italia contest. The contest that year became a springboard for a pool of potential actresses, including the winner Lucia Bosé, Mangano, and several other future stars of Italian cinema such as Gina Lollobrigida, Eleonora Rossi Drago and Gianna Maria Canale.

==Career==
Mangano&#x27;s earliest connection with filmmaking occurred through her romantic relationship with actor Marcello Mastroianni. This led her to a film contract, though it took some time for Mangano to ascend to international stardom with her performance in &quot;Bitter Rice&quot; (&quot;Riso Amaro&quot;, Giuseppe De Santis, 1949). She signed a contract with Lux Film in 1949, and later married producer Dino De Laurentiis.

Although she never had an international career to match her contemporaries Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, Mangano remained a favorite star between the 1950s and 1970s, appearing in &quot;Anna&quot; (Alberto Lattuada, 1951), &quot;L&#x27;oro di Napoli&quot; (Vittorio De Sica, 1954), &quot;Mambo&quot; (Robert Rossen, 1955), &quot;Teorema&quot; (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1968), &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (Luchino Visconti, 1971), &quot;The Scientific Cardplayer&quot; (Luigi Comencini, 1972), and &quot;Ludwig&quot; (Luchino Visconti, 1973). She played the lead role in the 1967 anthology film &quot;The Witches,&quot; which featured segments directed by Pasolini, Visconti, De Sica, and Mauro Bolognini. She collaborated four times with Pasolini and Visconti.

Over the course of her career, Mangano won the David di Donatello for Best Actress three times and the Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Actress twice. Her final film role was in Nikita Mikhalkov for &quot;Dark Eyes&quot;, for which received a Nastro d&#x27;Argento nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Although it was sung by Flo Sandon&#x27;s, Silvana Mangano was credited on the record label of &quot;El Negro Zumbón&quot;, which is from the soundtrack of the film &quot;Anna&quot; (1951) and was a hit song in 1953. A clip of the opening of this performance is featured in the film &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; (1988).

==Personal life==
It is claimed that she had an affair with Mohammad Reza Shah of Iran during the late 1940s. Married to film producer Dino De Laurentiis from 1949, the couple had four children: Veronica, Raffaella, Francesca, and Federico. Veronica&#x27;s daughter Giada De Laurentiis is the host of &quot;Everyday Italian&quot; and &quot;Giada at Home&quot; on the Food Network. Raffaella co-produced with her father on Mangano&#x27;s penultimate film, &quot;Dune&quot; (David Lynch, 1984). Federico died in an airplane crash in 1981 in Alaska. De Laurentiis and Mangano separated in 1983, and Mangano began divorce proceedings in 1988.

== Death ==
Following surgery on 4 December 1989 that left her in a coma, Mangano died of lung cancer in Madrid, Spain on 16 December 1989.

== Legacy ==
In 2000, the city of Rome named a street in the Vallerano district after Mangano.

<text>James Charles Bigglesworth, nicknamed &quot;Biggles&quot;, is a fictional pilot and adventurer, the title character and hero of the &quot;Biggles&quot; series of adventure books, written for young readers by W. E. Johns (1893–1968). Biggles made his first appearance in the story &quot;The White Fokker&quot;, published in the first issue of &quot;Popular Flying&quot; magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, &quot;The Camels Are Coming&quot; (both 1932). Johns continued to write &quot;Biggles books&quot; until his death in 1968. The series eventually included nearly a hundred volumes – novels as well as short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time.

The chronology of the canon, spanning both world wars, set up certain inconsistencies over the unavoidable ageing of Biggles and his friends. Also later editions had to be somewhat edited in line with changing norms of acceptability, especially regarding race, and in view of the pre-teenage readership who increasingly favoured both the books and the comics.

==Synopsis==
Biggles first appears as a teenaged &quot;scout&quot; (fighter) pilot in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) during the First World War. He joined the RFC in 1916 at the age of 17, having conveniently &quot;lost&quot; his birth certificate. Biggles represents a particularly British hero, combining professionalism with a gentlemanly air. Under the stress of combat he develops from a slightly hysterical youth prone to practical jokes to a calm, confident, competent leader. He is occasionally given &quot;special&quot; (secret) missions by the shadowy figure of Colonel (initially Major) Raymond (Air Commodore in later books, reflecting the creation of the Royal Air Force with its own ranks), who is already involved with the intelligence side of operations. Biggles is accompanied by his cousin Algernon (&#x27;Algy&#x27;) Lacey and his mechanic Flight Sergeant Smyth, who accompany Biggles on his adventures after the war. Added to the team in 1935 is the teenager Ginger Hebblethwaite.

==Biggles and his creator==
W. E. Johns was himself a First World War pilot, although his own career did not parallel that of Biggles particularly closely. The author&#x27;s initial war service was as an infantryman, fighting at Gallipoli and on the Macedonian front. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in September 1917, seconded to the Royal Flying Corps and posted back to England for flight training: Johns served as a flying instructor in England until August 1918, when he transferred to the Western Front. On 16 September 1918, his De Havilland DH4 was shot down on a bombing raid. His observer, Lieutenant Amey, was killed (in two of the stories in &quot;Biggles Learns to Fly&quot;, observers flying with Biggles are killed or badly wounded), but Johns survived to be taken prisoner of war. Johns remained with the RAF until 1927, latterly as an administrative officer rather than a pilot: his final rank was Flying Officer (equivalent to Lieutenant in the RFC) rather than the &quot;Capt.&quot; that formed part of his pen name.

While the purpose of the Biggles stories was to entertain adolescent boys, in the First World War books Johns paid attention to historical detail and helped recreate the primitive days of early air combat, in which pilots often died the first time they were in action and before devices such as oxygen supply and parachutes for those on board had become practical. Various models on which the Biggles character might have been based have been suggested, including rugby player and WWI flying ace Cyril Lowe, fighter pilot Albert Ball, and air commodore Arthur Bigsworth. Johns stated that the character was a composite of many individuals in the RFC (including himself).

The bulk of the Biggles stories are set after the First World War, and after Johns&#x27; flying career was over. Biggles has an unusually lengthy career, flying a number of aircraft representative of the history of British military aviation, from Sopwith Camels during the First World War, Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires in the Second World War, right up to the Hawker Hunter jet fighter in the postwar adventure &quot;Biggles in the Terai&quot;. In these later books geographic and historical accuracy is less evident and the grim detail of the first stories is moderated for an increasingly younger readership. The books were successful and were translated into Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Flemish, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.

==Fictional biography==
===Early life===

According to stories in &quot;The Boy Biggles&quot; and &quot;Biggles Goes to School&quot;, James Bigglesworth was born in India in May 1899, the son of an administrator in the Indian Civil Service and his wife. James was the younger of two sons, Charles being the elder by five years. The young James had little contact with European culture and commenced a lifelong affection for India, befriending the local Indian boys, exploring the countryside and learning to speak fluent Hindi. He retained a lifetime gift for languages and as an adult spoke French and German fluently, with a &quot;fair command&quot; of other languages. He spent holidays in England, under the custody of &quot;Dickpa&quot;, an eccentric uncle and inventor who lived in rural Buckinghamshire. When Biggles, now an adult, visits Dickpa, his father&#x27;s brother, again, an adventure begins that takes both men to Brazil (the Cruise of the Condor). Biggles then attended Malton Hall School in Hertbury, England. His first encounter with an aircraft was with a Blériot that landed on the school cricket ground.

=== First World War ===

Biggles left school and initially joined the army as a subaltern in the Royal Flying Corps and learned to fly in the summer of 1916, at No. 17 Flying Training School, which was at Settling, Norfolk, flying solo after two hours of instruction. He then attended No. 4 &#x27;School of Fighting&#x27; in Frensham, Lincolnshire.

Posted to France with under 15 hours, dual and solo, he first flew in combat in September 1916 with 169 Squadron, RFC, (commanded by Major Paynter). His observer was another youth named Mark Way, a New Zealander. Biggles began flying the F.E.2b &quot;pusher&quot; and later the Bristol F2B. In late summer 1917, he was transferred to 266 Squadron RFC, commanded by Major Mullen. With 266 Squadron, Biggles flew the Sopwith Pup and the famed Sopwith Camel, developing a friendly rivalry with &#x27;Wilks&#x27; (Captain Wilkinson) and the S.E.5s of 287 squadron and forming a close friendship with his young cousin Algy (the Hon. Algernon Montgomery Lacey). A study of the short stories featuring his First World War exploits, suggests that he had a &#x27;score&#x27; of 49 aircraft, three balloons and one submarine, while himself being shot down or crash-landing eight times. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross.

===Between the Wars===
After the Great War, Biggles&#x27; adventures as a freelance charter pilot, took him around the world in an unidentified amphibian named the &quot;Vandal&quot; (often illustrated on covers, anachronistically, as either a Supermarine Walrus or Supermarine Sea Otter). The nearest &quot;real&quot; aircraft that fits W. E. Johns description of the &quot;Vandal&quot;, is a Vickers Viking Mk 4. His team grows when he and Algy meet young Ginger Hebblethwaite in &quot;The Black Peril&quot;, while foiling a possible plot against Britain. Post-Second World War editions of the book change this plot from a German to a Russian plot. Ginger brings the energy and daring of youth to these and many of their later adventures. Between the wars Biggles and his friends mix their own escapades with ventures on behalf of British Secret Service.

=== Second World War ===
Biggles returned to service in the Second World War, initially with a Supermarine S6B type machine in the Baltic Sea and then to defy the Nazis and their allies in Norway. He then took up his post as Commanding Officer of 666 Squadron, RAF, a Special Duties squadron that fought in the Battle of Britain before being sent around the world on specific assignments. Biggles, Algy, Smyth and Hebblethwaite are joined by a new companion, the monocle-wearing Lord Bertram &#x27;Bertie&#x27; Lissie. The changed setting forced Johns to update his material with references to new flying slang and aeroplanes, unsuccessfully at first but later with more realism. Biggles&#x27; new squadron includes a diverse cast, including the American &#x27;Tex&#x27; O&#x27;Hara (from Texas), the Welshman &#x27;Taffy&#x27; Hughes, the Cockney &#x27;Tug&#x27; Carrington, the Oxford graduate Henry Harcourt and George &#x27;Ferocity&#x27; Ferris from the streets of Liverpool.

===Special Air Police===

After the Second World War Johns reinvents Biggles&#x27; career yet again, with his former boss Air Commodore Raymond hiring him as a &quot;flying detective&quot; for Scotland Yard. Biggles returns to his rooms in Mount Street, Mayfair and assumes a role as head of the new Special Air Police division with Algy, Ginger and Bertie making up the flying squad. The group takes on criminals who have taken to the air, both at home in Britain and around the globe, as well as battling opponents behind the Iron Curtain. The team fly a wide variety of machines, with Auster and Percival types doing much of the work.

Johns continued writing Biggles short stories and novels up until his death in 1968; in all, nearly 100 Biggles books were published.

A final unfinished novel, &quot;Biggles Does Some Homework&quot;, shows Biggles at last preparing to retire and meeting his mixed-race replacement; Johns died while writing this novel. The 12 completed chapters were issued privately in 1997.

== Characters ==
===Algernon Montgomery Lacey===
The Honourable Algernon Montgomery Lacey or &quot;Algy&quot; is a cousin who is posted to Biggles&#x27; flight in 266 Squadron by the influence of his aunt. Despite initial misgivings, the two soon become very close friends and eventually Algy adopts the role of Biggles&#x27; second in command. In the books set in the 1930s, Algy, Ginger and Smyth become Biggles&#x27; regular companions.

===Ginger Hebblethwaite===
Ginger (his real first name is never revealed) first appears in &quot;The Black Peril&quot; (1935) as a teenage runaway found hiding in a railway shed. Ginger left his father, a mineworker in Smettleworth, after an argument about Ginger&#x27;s determination to become a pilot. When he first meets Biggles, he tells him he is on his way to London to join the RAF. Biggles immediately calls him Ginger because of his red hair. He proves his worth by rescuing Biggles from some enemy agents. He becomes one of the regular team and is often Biggles&#x27;s chosen companion. He is a talented mechanic and his speech is peppered with youthful slang and Americanisms, learned from the cinema.

===Flight Sergeant Smyth===
Flight Sergeant Smyth is Biggles&#x27; trusty mechanic and logistic organiser since they first worked together in 266 Squadron during the First World War. Smyth, aside from being a mechanic in both world wars in Biggles&#x27;s squadron, also joins them on some journeys to act as mechanic, like &quot;Cruise of the Condor&quot; and &quot;Goes to War&quot;. Smyth is a very talented Mechanic and well respected by Biggles and co throughout the books.

===Lord Bertie Lissie===
First appearing in &quot;Spitfire Parade&quot; (1941), Lord Bertie is a pilot in 666 Squadron. An eccentric former racing driver, who flies with a hunting horn and a monocle, Bertie joins Biggles in the Air Police in most of the post-war stories. He is a brave and talented fighter, an expert shot and he has a lot of handy knowledge on a range of unusual subjects.

===Tug Carrington===
A counterpoint to Lord Bertie, Tug is a boxer from the slums of London. His parents being killed in the war, Tug is out for revenge and can be a very risky person to have around. He scorns alcohol, much to the amusement of his fellow squadron members. In return for Biggles setting him up for a job as a London cabby, he occasionally helps Biggles and his gang on their missions after the Second World War.

=== Erich von Stalhein ===
Biggles&#x27; greatest opponent is the German intelligence officer Erich von Stalhein, a member of an old Prussian family of soldiers. They first meet in &quot;Biggles Flies East&quot;, in which Biggles is a spy in the Middle East during the First World War, having some narrow escapes. Von Stalhein returns as an adversary in numerous other adventures: in &quot;Biggles &amp; Co.&quot; he is the leader of a group of smugglers based in a medieval castle somewhere in Germany. As the Cold War begins, von Stalhein enters the services of the Communist bloc, until his new masters imprison him on the island of Sakhalin, from where Biggles helps him to escape in &quot;Biggles Buries a Hatchet&quot;. Von Stalhein then settles in London and he and Biggles remain in touch. It is from von Stalhein that Biggles learns that Janis (see &quot;Female characters&quot; below) survived the Second World War and was imprisoned in Czechoslovakia, from where Biggles rescues her and goes on to support her in England.

=== William Raymond ===
First appears as a major (later colonel) in the British Intelligence service during the First World War, in which capacity he organises secret (&quot;special&quot;) missions in which Biggles takes part. In later books, he reappeared as an air commodore.The name William was used in the 1986 film. In the books the only reference is to his initials, &quot;R. B.&quot; Raymond.

=== Female characters ===
In the Biggles stories, female characters appear infrequently. Despite brief affairs, Biggles and his chums remain steadfastly single. Biggles suffers a disappointment in the First World War, when he falls in love with German spy Marie Janis in the short story &quot;Affaire de Coeur&quot;, set in 1918. Rather than being considered asexual or a repressed homosexual, Biggles&#x27; relationship with Janis suggests he is a romantic hero, &quot;tragically loyal to the only woman he ever really loved&quot;.

In &quot;Biggles &amp; Co.&quot; Stella Carstairs, the daughter of the man Biggles helps, turns up. A pilot herself, she is concerned for Biggles&#x27;s safety and tells him more than once not to take on her father&#x27;s request.

In &quot;Biggles Flies Again&quot; (1934), Algy becomes close to Consuelo, the daughter of the President of Bolivia, but is dissuaded from continuing the relationship by Biggles, &quot;... unless you intend marrying her&quot;. In &quot;Biggles Fails to Return&quot; (1943), Ginger falls in love with the sister of the French pilot who has flown Biggles into France on a secret mission and at the end of the story Ginger gets to spend several weeks in her company while awaiting transport back to England. The young Ginger is also smitten by the beautiful Polynesian girl Full Moon, in &quot;Biggles in the South Seas&quot; (1940).

There is a discussion of the issue of Biggles, sex and alcohol in &quot;By Jove, Biggles: The Life of Captain W. E. Johns&quot; (1981) by Peter Berresford Ellis and Piers Williams.

In the 1950s, a popular Australian radio version of Biggles, &quot;The Air Adventures of Biggles&quot;, was made under licence. Johns did not write the scripts and apparently ended the contract after receiving complaints from young readers that the storyline had made Biggles &quot;go soft&quot; by taking up a blonde female lover.

Another female character appears in the form of Worrals (Flight Officer Joan Worralson), eponymous heroine of a related series of books featuring this resourceful and &quot;plucky&quot; member of the WAAF. A further Johns creation, the commando Captain Lorrington &quot;Gimlet&quot; King, also features in a series of books that intersect with Biggles at times.

== Criticism and controversies ==
===Time===
The settings of the Biggles books are spread over more than 50 years; this produces a number of credibility difficulties, especially for older readers.

Though Biggles and his friends age in the books, they do so much more slowly (and inconsistently) than is historically credible. For instance, Biggles (with some of his First World War &quot;chums&quot;), who at that point should be well into their forties, are still relatively junior squadron officers flying Spitfires during the Battle of Britain. In the stories set after the end of the Second World War, Biggles and Algy, in particular, are, by the rules of arithmetic, passing into their fifties and early sixties, while retaining levels of activity and lifestyle more typical of people at least thirty years younger.

Even within a group of stories set in the same time frame, there are some chronological inconsistencies:
* Algy, for instance, seems to be younger than Biggles to a degree that is impossible, at least by the ordinary calendar.
* Biggles first meets Algy in &quot;The Camels Are Coming&quot;, at the end of which the First World War ends. However, Algy also features throughout &quot;Biggles in France&quot;, so the whole of &quot;Biggles in France&quot; must be set during the second half of &quot;The Camels Are Coming&quot;.
* Biggles seems to receive the same promotion multiple times.

It is doubtful whether a careful rearrangement of the various First World War stories could result in a coherent sequence. When W. E. Johns started the Biggles series, he can hardly have anticipated that he would be called on to write so many Biggles stories to short editorial deadlines, so that such inconsistencies are perhaps inevitable.

The author succeeds reasonably well in chronicling developments in aviation technology, but social and cultural changes are much more difficult. The cultural and social world of Biggles (whether in the 1930s or some earlier period) does not persist completely unchanged through the whole series – for instance, in an early book, the evidence points to an English nobleman as the perpetrator but Biggles dismisses this out of hand as the gentry would never commit a crime; in a later novel, one of the gentry is the villain. Nonetheless, the social context of the books, viewed in chronological order, does become increasingly old-fashioned, even anachronistic, especially in those works set after the Second World War.

===Allegations of racism===
Since the Biggles books were first published, attitudes to race and ethnicity have changed. A perception of Biggles during the 1960s and 1970s as unacceptably racially prejudiced, especially considered as children&#x27;s literature, led to the removal of the Biggles books from the shelves of many public and school libraries. Historian Marika Sherwood objected to Johns&#x27; use of &quot;chinks&quot; and &quot;coolies&quot; to describe people of Chinese origin in &quot;Biggles Hits the Trail&quot; (1935). Biggles&#x27; enemy is a group called the Chungs who &quot;chatter monkey-like&quot;. Jeff Sparrow, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014, commented: &quot;the later books, in particular, manifest all the racism you’d expect from an Empire loyalist writing in the sour era of British decline.&quot; Dennis Butts, in a 2000 essay, suggested Johns&#x27; Biggles stories had to be viewed historically and he was not a &quot;deliberate racist&quot;.

Biggles was raised in British India, speaks fluent Hindi and has Indian friends and colleagues. In &quot;Biggles Goes to School&quot;, on one occasion when told to write lines in Latin, he remarks that he would rather do so in Hindi. On another occasion the adult Biggles asserts to Air Commodore Raymond that &quot;while men are decent to me I try to be decent to them, regardless of race, colour, politics, creed or anything else&quot;. While individually developed non-white characters are infrequent, according to David Milner in &quot;Children and Race&quot; (1975), when they are part of the story, they are usually &quot;positive&quot;, from the Oxford-educated &quot;Chinaman&quot;, Li Chi, in &quot;Biggles Flies Again&quot; and &quot;Biggles Delivers the Goods&quot; and the perky Polynesian girl, Full Moon, in &quot;Biggles in the South Seas&quot;, to Alexander MacKay, a part &quot;Red Indian&quot; nicknamed &quot;Minnie&quot; who joins &quot;the chums&quot; as a valued colleague and is even set to inherit Biggles&#x27; job in &quot;Biggles Does Some Homework&quot;. Milner observed that the positive characteristics of these characters include relatively light complexions, Western education and general usefulness to the white hero and his friends and allies.

There are instances in which unpleasant &quot;foreigners&quot; are mixed race, and Johns has been accused of stereotyping non-whites. With the already mentioned &quot;Chungs&quot; of &quot;Biggles Hits the Trail&quot;, and the Aboriginals of &quot;Biggles in Australia&quot;, in particular, Johns applies stereotypes typical of his time to non-white opponents of his hero. In &quot;Biggles in Borneo&quot;, Dayak headhunters are stereotyped as barely human &quot;savages&quot;, even though they are Biggles&#x27; allies against the Japanese. The portrayals of non-whites in these books (and others in the &quot;Biggles&quot; canon) is typical of a once common genre of fiction for young people.

===&quot;Adult&quot; themes===
The early Biggles stories and novels, especially those set in First World War, were apparently written mainly for older adolescents. Death is a frequent theme, sometimes treated in quite a grim fashion. Other &quot;adult themes&quot; are also touched on: more than once Biggles sets out on a mission in a &quot;red mist&quot;, inspired by the death of a comrade. The emotional strain of combat is also realistically described, as Biggles becomes a &quot;highly-strung&quot; fidgeting pale youth, lacking his usual sense of humour. In these stories, in particular, alcohol is mentioned occasionally and cigarettes are much in evidence. The early First World War books were reprinted in the 1950s, when the Biggles books had acquired a younger readership and were bowdlerised. In the short story &quot;The Balloonatics&quot;, as republished in &quot;Biggles of the Special Air Police&quot;, the prize for capturing a German observation balloon was altered from a case of Scotch whisky to a case of lemonade. The reprint also removes all references to drinking and swearing.

Even the original editions contain no explicit sexual content and the traditional values of bravery, honesty and fair play are stressed. Romantic stories, which would have bored Johns&#x27; younger readers and embarrassed his older ones, are on the whole avoided, with the odd exception, such as in &quot;Biggles Looks Back&quot;, where he and von Stalhein rescue Marie Janis (with whom Biggles was briefly in love in an earlier story) from her prison in Bohemia.

==In other media==
===Television===

Biggles appeared in a TV series based on the books with Neville Whiting playing the title role. There were 44 B&amp;W untitled episodes of 30 minutes, which were made by Granada and ran from 1 April till 9 September 1960. Biggles was a Detective Air Inspector attached to Scotland Yard. Helping him were Ginger (John Leyton) and Bertie (David Drummond) and they fought against villains like von Stalhein (Carl Duering).

===Films===

He was also featured in the feature film &quot;Biggles&quot; (1986), directed by John Hough with Neil Dickson in the title role. The film attempted to add appeal to the character by adding a science fiction element but it was a commercial and critical failure. Dickson reprised the character in all but name in the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; feature film, &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;.

===Video games===
In 1986, a video game was released as a tie-in to the &quot;Biggles&quot; film by Mirrorsoft for the platforms Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It included levels based in 1917 and other levels set in modern-day London.

===Comics===
Many versions of Biggles comics have been published in countries such as Australia, Great Britain, Belgium, France and Sweden.

The first British annual appeared in 1980.
Some albums were released in 1990 featuring the Biggles team. The titles are separate from the books though they cover the same war or after war investigation operations of Biggles.

===Postage stamps===
Biggles featured on a stamp issued by the Royal Mail on 1 February 1994, as part of the sixth issue of its Greetings Stamps series. The set comprised ten first class stamps, each portraying a character from children&#x27;s literature. Aside from Biggles, the other characters featured were Dan Dare, The Three Bears, Rupert Bear, Alice in Wonderland, Noggin the Nog, Peter Rabbit, Red Riding Hood, Orlando the Marmalade Cat and Paddington Bear.

The stamps were designed by Newell and Sorrell, and the artist for the Biggles stamp was Alan Cracknell. Biggles is wearing a leather flying helmet and goggles, holding an &#x27;air mail&#x27; envelope addressed to him, and giving the thumbs up. A biplane, probably a De Havilland Tiger Moth is shown flying in the background.

Also included in the presentation pack were labels containing greetings messages. The two related to Biggles, shown in white text on a blue background, read &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and &quot;Chocks Away&quot;. The Biggles stamp, its associated presentation pack and first day covers were described in the British Philatelic Bulletin of January 1994.

===Music===
In Jethro Tull&#x27;s 1972 song, Thick As A Brick, 43:46 long, there is reference to Biggles in the part labeled &quot;Childhood Heroes&quot;.
&quot;&quot;So where the hell was Biggles, when you needed him last Saturday&quot; &quot;

===In other W. E. Johns books===
Biggles, or members of his team, have appeared in the following Gimlet books

* &quot;King of the Commandos&quot;
* &quot;Gimlet Goes Again&quot;
* &quot;Gimlet Mops Up&quot;
* &quot;Gimlet Bores In&quot;

Air Commodore Raymond also appeared in W. E. Johns&#x27; &quot;Steeley Books&quot;.

==Parodies ==
===&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;===
Biggles was parodied in a series of skits on the 1970s British comedy television show, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, including one titled &quot;Biggles Dictates a Letter&quot;. In the sketch, Biggles (Graham Chapman) behaves in a naive and overreactive manner about the sexual orientation of his comrades, shooting Algy in the process.

Other Monty Python treatments of Biggles include:
* &quot;Cardinal Biggles&quot;, complete with flying helmet and goggles, assists in the interrogations in the &quot;Spanish Inquisition sketch&quot;.
* Biggles appears as a woman&#x27;s lover in the sketch &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; accompanied by Algy.
* Two text stories, &quot;Biggles Is Extremely Silly&quot; and &quot;Biggles and the Naughty Things&quot;, are included in &quot;The Brand New Monty Python Bok&quot;.
* The title of a subsequent episode, &quot;Biggles Flies Undone&quot;, was mentioned at the end of &quot;Biggles Dictates a Letter&quot;, as if the two &quot;episodes&quot; were part of an ongoing adventure serial.
* In the first &quot;Comic Relief&quot; (1985), Michael Palin reads the skit &quot;Biggles Goes to See Bruce Springsteen&quot;.
* A customer in &quot;The Bookshop Sketch&quot;, originally from &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; and later found on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;, requests the fictitious &quot;Biggles Combs his Hair&quot;.

===Other parodies===
* &quot;Biggles Flies a Fokker Home&quot; is a 2011 play written by former cricketer James Graham-Brown under the pen name Dougie Blaxland.
* In the novel &quot;Good Omens&quot;, a book titled &quot;Biggles Goes to Mars&quot; is mentioned, although context suggests that it may be (but is not definitely) the invention of an 11-year-old fond of outlandish adventure stories, and might not have existed previously.
* The 1972 song from the eponymous album &quot;Thick as a Brick &quot; by Jethro Tull has the line, &quot;Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?&quot;
* The lead character of the play &quot;Bullshot Crummond&quot; parodies Bulldog Drummond and Biggles.
